<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthropological i-iscellanea and New Books. 427 Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology (Smithsonian). By A. W. BUCKLAND. The ninth annual " Report of the Bureau of Ethnology" (Smithsonian) brings that carefully prepared and elaborately illustrated work up to the year 1888. Three volumes have been issued in quick succession, so that perhaps the publication may soon be brought up to date. Each of the later volumes has also been accompanied by a bibliography of various Indian tribes, of great use to students, but not of so much general interest as the papers in the body of the work. Of these we may note in vol. vii an important paper by the Director on " Inidian Linguistic Families,' accompanied by a map showing the distribution of the various linguistic stocks, of w[hich the Athapascan and the Algonquian now occupy the largest amount of territory, although the Esquimauan seems to have extended all round the northern coasts to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, whilst on the Pacific coast there is a singular intermingling of all the continental tongues with many which apparently do not extend into the interior, suggesting either a constant straggle for possession of the seaboard, or frequent immigrations from the Pacific. Both the people and the languages of the vast American continents are unsolved riddles. Ethnologists regard all the niumerous tribes as belonging to the same Mongoloid race, yet the languages spoken appear to be more numerous and diverse than in other parts of the world occupied by various races. North of Mexico to the arctic regions, Major Powell reckons fifty-eight linguistic families, each containing several tribes, and of these he says, " It is believed that the families of languages represented upon the inap cannot have sprung from a common source; they are as distinct from one another in their vocabularies, and apparently in their origin, as from the Aryan or the Scythian families," and again he says, " There is little reason to doubt that, as the result of investigation in the field, there will be discovered tribes speaking languages not classifiable under any of the present families." "All the families occupy the same basis of dissimilarity from one another, i.e., none of them are related, and consequently no two of them are either more or less alike than any other two, except in so far as mere coincide-nces and borrowed material may be said to constitute likenaess and relationship," and he adds, " There is not a single Indian linguistic family which does not contain words similar in sound, and more rarely, similar in both sound and mean- ingr, to words in English, Chinese, Hebrew, and other languages." Notwithstanding the manner in which these linguistic stocks have become widely separated in some parts and intermingled in others, reminding one of the changes in a kaleidoscope, Major Powell, contrary to tle comnmon opinion, regards the Indians as 2 F 2</page><page sequence="2">428 Anthropological Mliscellanea and New Books. sedentary rather than nomadic, and traces many of the dialects to internecine strife. ":Factions," he says, "divided and separated from the parent body, by contact, inter-marriage, and incorporation with foreign tribes, developed 'distinct dialects or languages." But if languages have thuis arisen, it does not seem possible that they could have become so totally dissimilar as these appear to be. The subject is an extremely difficult one, and is confessedly in its infancy, but the lDirector of the Bureau of Ethnology and his able assistants are doing much to bring order out of chaos. In continuation of his linguistic studies, Major Powell is preparing a map to show the original habitat of the several tribes, a comparison of which with the one now issued will be of great interest. As bearing upon Major Powell's belief in the generally sedentary character of the Indian tribes, Mr. Victor Mindeliff's exhaustive " Study of Pueblo Architecture," in vol. viii, deserves especial notice. The Pueblos extend over an immense tract of country, chiefly in New Mexico and Arizona, and include those remarkable cliff dwellings in the Canyon de Chelly and the Chaco Canyon, the description of which is not included, being left for a future article. The architecture of all the Pueblos appears to be of the same type, consisting of square stone-built houses or lodges, built in terraces one over the other, or partly scooped out in sandstone cliffs, access to most of them being by ladders. Some of these Pueblos are still inhabited, biut many are ruined and deserted, the age of these remaining undetermined, altlhough some have certainly been occupied since the Spanish Conquest. From the general likeness of all these dwellings, Mr. Mindeliff believes that both the ancient and modern Pueblos have been con- structed by the same tribes at various periods, even the most ancient by the ancestors of the present Zanis, Navajos, Apaches, and kindred tribes. The traditions of the present inhabitants treat of many migrations, owing to wars, famines, and other disturbing elements, and contain many curious myths of the origin of the various cognate tribes. Every Pueblo contains several kivas, that is, buildings devoted to the religious ceremonies of the people. These kivas are all built on one plan, and are apparently, as a rule, oriented to the south-east. The corner-stones are laid at the cardinal points by a medicine man, with special prayers, and when finished the kiva is consecrated by a sprinkling of sacred meal and the hanging up of prayer sticks. The ancient kivas are supposed to have been circular in form, but the modern are all rectangular and partially subterranean. One peculiar feature is that each is furnished with a hollow about a fcot deep, covered with a slab of wood, in which is bored a hole fitted with a wooden plug. This is the holy of holies, round which the fetishes are placed; it represents the hole through which the human race emerged after their creation in the lower world; for</page><page sequence="3">A iki6"lt)opoloyiccal lliscellanct antd il-ev Books. 429 the traditions of all these Pueblo Indians say that men were created in a dark cavern, whence they reached the upper world by four stages, all of which are represented in the kiva, as also the miagic pine tree or reed by which they ascended, whichl is typified by a ladder always of pine. This myth seems to bear a strong resemblance to the story of Jack and the beanstalk. There is another which probably accounts for the orientation of the kivas, and which appears to be of considerable importance; it relates that a brilliant star arose in the south-east which would shine for awhile and then disappear. The old men of the Sinake people said, "' Beneath that star there must be people'; so they determined to travel toward it. They cut a staff and set it in the ground, and watched till the star reached its top, theiu they started and travelled as long as the star shone; wheii it disappeared they halted, for the star did not shine every night, for sometimes many years elapsed before, it shone again. When this occurred our people built houses during their halt; they built both round and square houses, and all the ruins between here and Navajo Mountain mark the places where our people lived." It is a curious fact that among these Pueblos are found rows, squares, and circles of -upright stones, and stone pillars, the latter of which, whatever may have been their ancient use, serve at preselnt "' as a datum point in the observations of the sun, made by a priest of Zuni, for the regulation of the time for planting and harvesting, for determining the new year, and for fixing the dates of certain other ceremonial observances." There are also found in the walls of some of the houses stones bored with large circular holes, said to have served as doorways, but as the usuial doorways are square, it seems probable that the holed stones had some ceremonial use, analogous to that ascribed to similar stones in the eastern hemi- sphere. It is imnpossible to touch upon the numerous points of interest connected with the masonry and ornamentation of these Pueblos, but it may be necessary to treat of some of them when the promised paper on the Canon de Chelly appears. One article in each of the three latestvolumes is devoted to Indian myths and ceremonies. That upon the Mide-wiwin or " Grand Mlediciine Society of the Ojibwa," by W. J. Hoffman, is a fall account of that remarkable combination of magical rites and jugglery, with a certain amount of medical skill in the administration of herbal remedies. In this great secret society there are four grades, the admission into each being accompanied by many curious ceremonies in which the sacred medicine bags play a great part, being employed, as is supposed, to shoot into the body of the candidate the migis shell, the sacred einblem of the society. The shaman who has passed into the fourth grade is believed to be possessed of miraculous powers. In all these ceremonies the number four and its multiples are constantly employed, a.nd crosses symbolical of the cardinal points, and painted in accordance with the custom of the tribe, are set up as sacred objects The records of the</page><page sequence="4">430 Anthropological 3fwiscellca(eca and New Books. society consist of remnarkable pictograplhs or hieroglyphics on birchl bark, and appropriate songs accompany every ceremony. Mr. Mooney's articJe upon " The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees," vol. vii, forms as it were a supplement to that on the Mide-wiwin of the Ojibwa. It contains the medlcal andl magical formulas employed by Cherokee shamans in all diseases, consisting of invocations to animal gods, the Sun, Thunder, Fire, Water, the Red Man, the Red Woman, Little Men, and Little People, or Fairies, who are invoked ini mystical songs, not only in cases of sickness, but for success in love, war, or huniting, or to destroy an enemy, the means employed recalling those in use for the same purpose by witches in Europe. In these invocations a very archaic language is used, a kind of sacred tongue, hardly understood even by the shamans. The ceremonial of Hasielti Dailjis and Mythical Sand Paintings of the Navajo Indians, by James Stevenson, vol. viii, appears to be a variant of the ceremolies described by Dr. Washington Matthews in " The Mountain Chant," and gives four more of the remarkable sand paintings employed by the Navajos in their healing ceremoniies. The elongated figures surrounded by the anthropomorphic rain- bow are similar to those of the Mountain Chant, but the coin- binations are different. The use of a square of four sticks tied atf the corners, to symbolize the four winds, seems to give a clue to the meaning of this figure as found on engraved shells, and in Mexicain paintings. There is also an elaborate description of the preparation of various medicine tubes, a-nd of the foods eaten during the ceremonies. The use of masks in the initiation ceremonies is described, as also the sprinkling of sacred meal or corn pollen, which appears to be identical with the Hoddentin described by Capt. John Bourke in his article on " The Medicine Men of the Apache" in vol. ix, by whom it is compared with a powder used in the East and in Japan, as a curative agent and rejuvenator, which according to Capt. Bourke represents everywhere the principle of fertility. Capt. Bourke's paper is full of interesting analogies between the practices of the Indian shamans, and the symbolism employed by them and similar usages in the Old World. The most suggestive perhaps is the use of sacred cords among so many different races in Asia, Africa, and America, as compared with priestly girdles and rosaries, and the use of coloured threads in medicine. It is impossible to name the many curious resem- blances brought forward bv Capt. Bourke, some of which are perhaps somewhat far-fetched, but the paper is well worth careful study by anthropologists. The whole of vol. ix is taken up with this paper, and ani extremely lengthy one by John Murdoch, on the " Ethnological Results of the Point Barrow Expedition,' describing and fully illustrating the natives, their mode of life, tools, and household arrangements, religious and medical observances, preparation of food, drink, dress and ornaments, their dancing masks, amulets and remarkable carvings in bone and ivory, their music and</page><page sequence="5">AnthrpQoloyical Miscellanea a?tdc AN.,w Books. 481 songs, and mode of disposing of the dead, showing them to be a simple and ingenious people, but not differing greatly from other Eskimo tribes.</page></plain_text>
