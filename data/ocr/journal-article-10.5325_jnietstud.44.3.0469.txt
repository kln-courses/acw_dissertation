      <p>This essay focuses on one of Nietzsche's greatest challenges to both our common and philosophical understanding of perception and cognition: his “falsification thesis.”<sup>1</sup> As it is commonly understood, the thesis states that human cognition “falsifies” the world by distorting it, thus making all of our claims about the world, as products of such “falsifying” cognition, false. There are a host of innovative and insightful attempts in the literature to understand Nietzsche's claims and free him from performative contradiction.<sup>2</sup> These attempts fail, however, because they have not made an adequate connection between Nietzsche's falsification claims and his naturalistic account of the development of human cognition. I begin by presenting and briefly evaluating three distinct types of “falsification” to which Nietzsche calls our attention. I then move to highlighting some of the interpretive difficulties that attend apparent claims to unconditional falsification and some of the possible strategies for resolving them. While we might attempt to resolve these difficulties by rejecting unconditional falsification on grounds of internal incoherence, I argue that Nietzsche's naturalism actually provides an explanation for the success of cognition and science <italic>despite</italic> inevitable falsification. That is, Nietzsche's naturalism explains how we may have knowledge and successfully pursue science <italic>without</italic> avoiding falsification altogether.</p>

         <title>Nietzsche's Falsification Claims</title>
         <p>A disservice is done to Nietzsche's falsification claims and our understanding of them when they are lumped together as if they composed a single thesis. There are three distinct sources of falsification to which Nietzsche calls our attention: (1) falsification due to language, reason, or consciousness; (2) falsification due to the senses; and (3) falsification due to improper judgments about our cognitive status. A close examination of each of these forms of falsification will enable us to clarify what precisely is being falsified in each case and how, or from what perspective, such falsification can be detected and asserted.<sup>3</sup> Only by clarifying each of these can we hope to grasp the far-reaching implications of Nietzsche's general epistemological picture for our understanding of perception, knowledge, science, and the world. I first set out the three forms of falsification before turning to the thornier issue of what is falsified in each case and how Nietzsche can justify his falsification claims.</p>
         <p>Nietzsche most frequently writes of falsification due to language, which is also the most general and intractable form of falsification. Consciousness and reason falsify because they make use of concepts and grammatical structure that themselves falsify. Thus Nietzsche reaches the conclusion that “all becoming conscious involves a vast and thorough corruption, falsification, superficialization, and generalization” because “the world of which we can become conscious is merely a surface- and sign-world, a world turned into generalities and thereby debased to its lowest common denominator” (<italic>GS</italic> 354).<sup>4</sup> Likewise, he argues that “‘Reason’ is the cause of our falsification of the testimony of the senses” because it employs concepts such as unity, thinghood, substance, and permanence, while also employing the subject-predicate grammatical structure that insinuates a doer for every deed. It is the insinuation of a doer for every deed that in turn demands a cause, which in turn demands a thing, a substance, and, most generally, being (<italic>GM</italic> I:13). The category of being, on Nietzsche's account, thus derives from grammatical structure (<italic>TI</italic> “Reason” 2, 5; <italic>BGE</italic> 21).<sup>5</sup> Language, and the consciousness and reason that it structures, falsify as a result of their conceptual and grammatical structure.<sup>6</sup> They do so by simplifying experience and by giving it order, structure and permanence that are either contradicted by other experience or shown to be ultimately incoherent in their own right.</p>
         <p>Somewhat less frequently, Nietzsche ascribes falsification also to the senses. In a series of sections from <italic>TI</italic> that at first appear aimed at vindicating the veracity of the senses over against language and reason, Nietzsche argues, with regard to the apparent movement of the sun across the sky, that our eyes are “the constant advocate of error” (<italic>TI</italic> “Reason” 5). We can add that it is not only our eyes that advocate error. We do not at all sense the movement of the earth that modern astronomy has taught us to accept. Indeed, relying on the senses alone it seems we would be forced to affirm that we are standing still. Our present motion at approximately 1,000 kilometers per hour about the earth's axis and 106,000 kilometers per hour through space around the sun would be quite unbelievable. We should note Nietzsche's suggestion in this section of <italic>TI</italic> that both reason and the senses can testify against each other's errors. Indeed, for Nietzsche, it is reason that leads us to identify the clear sensation that we are not presently moving at 1,000 kilometers per hour as an error and the senses that allow us to identify posits of permanence as erroneous.</p>
         <p>Nietzsche also argues for much more fundamental falsification by the senses that at first seems at least hyperbolic, if not confused. He argues that in every sensation and sense impression there is “some fantasy, some prejudice, some irrationality, some ignorance” (<italic>GS</italic> 57; cf. <italic>GS</italic> 107, 110). He also argues, “As soon as we see a new picture, we immediately construct it with the help of old experiences we have had <italic>depending on the degree</italic> of our honesty and justice. There are no experiences other than moral ones, not even in the realm of sense perception” (<italic>GS</italic> 114). Leaving aside for the moment the moral charge that Nietzsche appends to the last statement, the strangeness of such claims quickly fades when we recall the varying sensitivity of sense organs, well known since ancient times, relative to previous stimulation (e.g., Plato's escapee's problems adjusting to variations in light as he leaves the cave). Our organs are not an open conduit of the “external world.” They already shape the world by their range, type, and structure of sensitivity. Thus not only is the sensitivity of my eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and tactile sensation determined by prior sensations, but, as Ernst Mach (with whose work Nietzsche was familiar) argued, “<italic>under different circumstances [the sense-organs] produce different sensations and perceptions</italic>…. And it is customary to call the unusual effects, deceptions or illusions.”<sup>7</sup> Mach goes on to argue that visual sensation is structured by habituation, a principle of economy, and a principle of probability whereby the eye sees both what it is habituated to see and, in general, what requires the least effort for it to see.<sup>8</sup> Sensation itself, at the level of the sense organs and neural stimulus, already structures the world. From different perspectives, including those that make use of technology, we gain competing perceptions of the world. For both Nietzsche and Mach, the claim is not that the senses “add” something to or distort an underlying mind independent entity. For Nietzsche it is clear that the selecting, structuring, and interpreting done by the senses is necessary for the appearance of anything at all. The senses then falsify, for Nietzsche, simply insofar as they do not reflect phenomena either fully or purely or even consistently and in a universally singular manner.<sup>9</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Finally, Nietzsche articulates a third kind of falsification that does not so much distort the world as the nature of our relation to it and the status of our claims about it. He argues that we fall into error when we understand our perceptions of and claims about the world as providing an objective, or perspective-independent, characterization of the world (<italic>GM</italic> III:12; cf. <italic>GS</italic> 301). Here it is not our perceptions or claims per se that are falsifying. Rather, it is the objectivity we ascribe to them that is falsifying. Thus Nietzsche allows, for example, our use of “cause” and “effect” “as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and communication,” but argues we go wrong when we “reify” them and then “project and mix this symbol world into things as if it existed ‘in itself’” (<italic>BGE</italic> 21). Although Nietzsche may have independent grounds for arguing that “cause,” “effect,” or other concepts that he often refers to as “anthropomorphic” distort the world in some way (<italic>GS</italic> 109), the specific falsifying error he has in mind in passages like <italic>BGE</italic> 21 is that of wrongly construing the perspectival and anthropomorphic as objective and mind independent.</p>
         <p>The most pressing question to resolve with respect to these three forms of falsification is the following: does any one of them, or do the three taken together, commit Nietzsche to general and inevitable falsification of the world such that all of our beliefs about the world would turn out to be false? It seems we can quickly eliminate the third form from committing Nietzsche to inevitable falsification. For, even as he articulates falsification by misconstruing the nature of our cognitive relation to the world, he also articulates an alternative self-understanding. Such falsification should thus simply be understood as contingent and, at least in principle, eradicable. There appears to be somewhat less hope for the other two forms of falsification, however. As we have seen, he claims, “all becoming conscious involves a vast and thorough corruption, falsification, superficialization, and generalization” (<italic>GS</italic> 354), and that in every sensation and sense impression there is “some fantasy, some prejudice, some irrationality, some ignorance” (<italic>GS</italic> 57). He even claims “delusion and error [are] a condition of cognitive and sensate existence” (<italic>GS</italic> 107). Even in <italic>TI</italic>, where he appears to vindicate at least the necessary falsification of the senses by assigning falsification instead to reason, he reinforces the inevitability of falsification by reason and language by arguing that “every word we say and every sentence” speaks in favor of the error of being over becoming (<italic>TI</italic> “Reason” 5). It seems that even if we discard Nietzsche's remarks about the falsification intrinsic to sensation and sensate existence as confused hyperbole that Nietzsche finally comes to reject in <italic>TI</italic>, he seems, pace Clark, clearly and emphatically to reassert general falsification, at least whenever we talk about any “thing” that “exists,” that is, whenever we talk about anything at all (<italic>TI</italic> “Reason” 5).<sup>10</sup>
         </p>
         <p>As I mentioned at the outset, there are a number of interpretive difficulties in making sense of Nietzsche's apparent commitment to general and inevitable falsification. Among these, an unconditional claim of falsification seems to commit Nietzsche to that which he clearly denies, the existence of determinate mind-independent properties, or things in themselves. Lanier Anderson has recently defended an interpretation of Nietzsche's falsification claims that seeks to show how Nietzsche can maintain falsification and avoid any commitment to things in themselves. Anderson argues that Nietzsche takes all consciousness to be falsifying because consciousness necessarily distorts the “<italic>unconscious</italic> sense impressions,” which are for Nietzsche essentially chaotic.<sup>11</sup> It is difficult, however, to make sense of the claim that consciousness distorts, or even transforms, unconscious sense impressions without recommitting him to the existence of determinate mind-independent properties. For if sense impressions are truly disordered or chaotic, then they lack any determinate content that could be falsified. Conversely, if sense impressions do have determinate content that could be falsified, then either we must conclude that Nietzsche was in fact committed to mind-independent determinate properties, or we should downgrade “falsification” to mere hyperbole because the ordering or “logicizing” of <italic>mental</italic> sense impressions with determinate content would not amount to any fundamental falsification, or even transformation, in the sense intended. As with the general claim that language, reason, or consciousness falsifies some underlying precognitive and prelinguistic content, it seems we must either conclude that “falsification” is a misnomer because such content has no determinate qualities, or that Nietzsche was committed to things in themselves after all. Unfortunately, Anderson's proposed solution does not furnish us with a way both to take falsification seriously and to avoid ascribing to Nietzsche commitments he explicitly rejects.<sup>12</sup> Nietzsche's naturalistic account of cognition, however, does enable us to do both of these. With its help we can understand the claims that consciousness <italic>and</italic> sensation falsify as substantive epistemological theses that do not depend on any commitment to mind-independent determinate properties or things in themselves.</p>

         <title>Falsification and Naturalism</title>
         <p>Nietzsche's naturalism consists in a commitment to do without transcendent and teleological explanation in general (<italic>GS</italic> 109; <italic>BGE</italic> 230). With regard to humanity in particular, it is a commitment to interpret human phenomena consistently and continuously with the rest of the natural world. Nietzsche's naturalism is a heuristic principle that leads him to develop interpretations of phenomena that are consistent with a nonteleological developmental picture of the natural world. In turn, the principle requires intense scrutiny of any concept or theory that makes recourse to ideas or principles that are inconsistent with such a picture. It is a virtue of his naturalism that he is able to explain the source of conceptual “errors” such as “permanence,” “substance,” or “being,” explain why they are erroneous, and explain how they nevertheless serve both human life and human knowledge. On Nietzsche's naturalistic picture, human knowledge succeeds not because of any objective correspondence between minds and world, nor due to necessary conformity of objects to forms and categories of cognition. Human knowledge succeeds because conceptual capacities are just good enough to serve our interests. In other words, we parse the world in ways that are wrought with error but nevertheless allow us to meet our needs and even plan for the future. What stands behind our success? The luck of our evolutionary development. If our capacities were either ill suited to the world we live in or ill suited to meeting our interests, then either we would not have survived at all, or we would have survived as very differently abled creatures. The fact that our capacities are well suited to the world we live in does not, however, mean that they get things right. Perhaps Nietzsche's most interesting insight, and what he claims might well sound strangest, is that falsifying perceptions, judgments, and beliefs may well be the most valuable; they may even count most strongly as knowledge (e.g., the interpretation of the world given by physics [<italic>BGE</italic> 14] or the quantification of the world in science more generally [<italic>BGE</italic> 4]).</p>
         <p>We are now in a position to understand Nietzsche's claims of fundamental falsification by both the senses and the higher linguistic elements of cognition in a naturalistic-evolutionary manner. Nietzsche explicitly argues, “No living being would be preserved had not the […] disposition to affirm rather than suspend judgment, to err and make things up rather than wait, to agree rather than deny, to judge rather than be just—been cultivated so extraordinarily strongly” (<italic>GS</italic> 111). He also argues, “We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we are able to live—by positing bodies, lines, planes, causes and effects, motion and rest, form and content; without these articles of faith no one could endure living! But that does not prove them. Life is not an argument; the conditions of life might include error” (<italic>GS</italic> 121). In light of these passages and Nietzsche's general naturalistic account of cognition, when Nietzsche claims that “delusion and error [are] a condition of cognitive and sensate existence” (<italic>GS</italic> 107), we should understand him as claiming that our sensory capacities are such that we inevitably crudely perceive the world as consisting in discrete, unified objects that persist unchanged over time. Moreover, the crudeness of sensory capacities leads us to quickly group insufficiently dissimilar things as equivalent to one another (e.g., trees, other humans, etc.). The falsification that begins with our senses is extended by concepts and grammatical structures that formalize many of the sensory errors while adding lots of new ones (e.g., cause and effect, form and content, atom, soul, will, etc.).</p>
         <p>While Nietzsche presents many of these falsifications as actually necessary for life and integral to knowledge (since all knowledge is expressed in signs and much of scientific knowledge relies on quantification of phenomena), we must still face the question, from what perspective does Nietzsche gain the right to describe sensory and conceptual simplification as falsification? It seems Nietzsche must reserve some privileged perspective immune to falsification for his own criticisms. Fortunately, Nietzsche does not need to make recourse to such an ad hoc position of personal immunity or privileged perspective. In fact, we have already seen a substantive clue as to how Nietzsche can make general falsification claims without falling prey to self-referential paradoxes. At <italic>TI</italic> “Reason” 5, when he discusses the errors of both reason and the senses, he makes it clear that each can testify against the other, as well as testifying against themselves in the form of immanent critique. Thus empirical claims can be shown erroneous by other empirical claims or rational arguments, and rational or logical claims can be shown to be erroneous by demonstrating their internal incoherence or their inconsistency with empirical claims. All that Nietzsche needs to make his general falsification claims plausible is (1) agreement that we generally tend to perceive and describe the world under the forms and categories Nietzsche characterizes as erroneous (e.g., as consisting in discrete unified objects that are causally linked and persist unchanged over time); and (2a) perceptual evidence that suggests “objects” are neither unified wholes nor unchanging or (2b) rational arguments that show basic concepts such as “substance” or “cause” to be ultimately incoherent. If we are willing to assent to the first claim and grant that Nietzsche has either the perceptual or rational evidence or both on his side, then he is well justified in claiming that we are in error any time we perceive the world as consisting of discrete objects grouped by kinds and linked by causal interaction. Despite their generality, Nietzsche's falsification claims must not be understood as trivial or academic quibbles. They are the constituting evidence of the naturalistic conception of cognition and knowledge he develops. They show how knowledge is not only possible, but in fact arises in concert with the development of our sensory and cognitive capacities, rather than as a result of a “pre-established harmony,” transcendental subjects, or even objective correspondence between mind and world.</p>
         <p>The paradoxes that seem to surround Nietzsche's falsification claims recede still further when we confront his claims about the continuity of knowledge and ignorance. Nietzsche argues in a variety of passages that knowledge and ignorance are not opposed fundamentally, but rather that knowledge is built on and a refinement of ignorance, that knowledge and falsification are linked insofar as they serve the higher value of life, and that life uses both to its advantage (<italic>BGE</italic> 24; <italic>GS</italic> 110; see also Nietzsche's remarks on logic at <italic>GS</italic> 111). Nietzsche, in turn, calls into question the bivalent opposition of truth and falsity, suggesting instead “degrees of apparentness” as a more useful measure (<italic>BGE</italic> 34). When he comes to examine the scientific will to truth (<italic>GS</italic> 344; <italic>GM</italic> III:24–25), Nietzsche suggests, first, that the means science uses in its pursuit of truth (quantification, “matter,” “cause” and “effect,” etc.) are known simplifications of phenomena that do not, in fact, correspond to the phenomena in question (<italic>BGE</italic> 24) and, second, that the absolute freedom from deception science is sometimes understood to be seeking is not actually conducive to life. The position Nietzsche articulates is one where science fundamentally makes use of both truth and untruth in the service of life.</p>

         <title>Naturalism, Falsification, and Science</title>
         <p>Despite some attempts to broaden the scope and meaning of Nietzsche's naturalism, commentators have tended to reduce it to a commitment to only what is consistent with our best empirical science.<sup>13</sup> While Nietzsche is certainly friendly toward science, I have argued that he does not accept science as the final arbiter of truth and knowledge (<italic>BGE</italic> 14, 21), and that his naturalism does not rest on or entail a commitment to science. Nietzsche's naturalism does not entail an epistemological commitment to any privileged source of truth or knowledge. Rather, when we understand Nietzsche's naturalized account of human cognition, we see that the tendency to make falsifying inferences arises specifically because of our successful evolutionary development. As Kevin Hill has recently argued, Nietzsche responds to the long-standing puzzle of the harmony between human cognition and the world with neither a transcendent or transcendental account, but with a naturalistic evolutionary account. However, contrary to Hill's further claims, Nietzsche does not invoke “falsification” to qualify ordinary human “phenomenal” perceptions of the world in contrast to supposedly truer “physical” accounts given by our best science. Given the misleading tendency to align Nietzsche's naturalism with the claims of science, Hill's otherwise insightful account is worth examining as a case in point.</p>
         <p>As Hill convincingly shows, Nietzsche's naturalism develops, at least in part, as a critical alternative to Kant's attempt to guarantee the objective validity of knowledge about the physical world by recourse to the noumenal self that imposes space and time on the natural world we experience.<sup>14</sup> Only by making the Euclidian-Newtonian forms of space and time necessary and universal forms of experience can Kant win the objective validity he seeks for science, particularly the paradigm of Newtonian physics. The price Kant has to pay for such a guarantee, however, is the posit of a noumenal subject that stands outside the natural order insofar as it gives the natural order its very form. By contrast, Nietzsche rejects the excess of the noumenal realm as itself incoherent, rejects the thesis that the human mind defines the necessary and universal conditions of knowledge, and develops an account of human knowledge that accounts for its success developmentally. The price Nietzsche has to pay for his naturalistic account—one that he is very happy to pay, though many of us may not be—is forfeiture of any guarantee of objective, or even intersubjective, validity for knowledge claims. Nietzsche instead gives us a picture in which knowledge claims reflect human cognitive capacities and interests, are valid only relative to a perspective, and are continuous with error and ignorance rather than bivalently true or false. For instance, the desk in front of me is, from my perspective, perfectly solid, as are the books, papers, glass, and computer sitting on top of it. From a different perspective, however, all of the “objects” I've just named are not solid at all. They consist mostly of empty space. It is not even clear that there is any solid matter at all, given our ability to describe what we previously took to be material as loci of force. “My solid material desk” and “loci of immaterial force” are clearly inconsistent and opposed descriptions of the same part of the natural world, each of which is valid in terms of the cognitive interests of its perspective. There is no general answer to the question, which one is the right or true description? Again, the right or true description can be determined only by the cognitive interests of the perspective in question. If I want to know whether the desk I've just been given is a sturdy, well-built one that is still in good solid condition (rather than a desk that was shoddily built or perhaps structurally unsound because internally eaten away by termites), then questions about micro-physical structure and which of the going theoretical descriptions is the proper one are of no interest to me. Likewise, if I am attempting to determine the proper characterization of what has historically been called “matter,” the specific characteristics of any particular desk will have no bearing on my investigation. Moreover, we may even find that more than one description of the basic structure of “matter” is appropriate, just as wave-particle duality holds that all matter and energy can be described as particulate or as wave-like.<sup>15</sup> These are not equivalent descriptions of the same thing in the way that “Schnee” and “snow,” “47” and “XLVII,” “x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 1” and “sin<sup>2</sup> θ + cos<sup>2</sup> θ = 1” are. Wave-particle duality ascribes inconsistent descriptions of the same phenomena, that is, descriptions that parse the phenomena in different ways, both of which are equally justifiable from the different perspectives that generate each description. Indeed, following Nietzsche's recommendation, we ought to understand the ability to describe the same phenomena from a variety of (not necessarily consistent) perspectives to be the mark of greater objectivity (<italic>GM</italic> III:12).<sup>16</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Bearing these arguments in mind, we should reject Hill's account of Nietzsche's naturalism and falsification claims whereby Nietzsche is said to diverge from Kant insofar as he refuses to identify space and time as we experience them with “the space and time of nature.”<sup>17</sup> For Hill, the space and time of nature is just space and time as it is identified by our best scientific theory.<sup>18</sup> The implication is not the trivially true claim that our standard Euclidian experience of space does not accord with contemporary theories of “curved” space. The implication is rather that there is a single universal and objective character of space and time that science is in the business of identifying. Nietzsche, however, specifically rejects the idea that science gives us objective knowledge of the world (<italic>BGE</italic> 14) and calls into question the very idea of a determinate objective world. If the nature described by science is not to take on the characteristics of the thing in itself, then it must remain one perspectival interpretation among many possible others. The actual state of affairs of contemporary science, wherein there is no consensus on the best or right theory of the basic character of the natural world, should remind us that in science as elsewhere “perspective estimates” reign (<italic>BGE</italic> 34; cf. <italic>GS</italic> 374; <italic>BGE</italic> 2, 11).</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Unfortunately, the issue of falsification has often been set up as if it were an all-or-nothing proposition. Either we live with complete falsification, or falsification turns out to have been mistaken and we can go back to relying on our commonsense beliefs in empirical science.<sup>19</sup> I have attempted to cut a middle path with the help of Nietzsche's naturalism. There may, in fact, be very little chance of escaping falsification altogether, insofar as it seems we must falsely imply the unity and permanence of some “thing” in order to speak about anything at all. Nietzsche's most important insight, however, is that the basic falsifications and simplifications of sensation and language are not only often quite useful, but also the cornerstone of knowledge and science. That is, we accomplish a great deal relying on simplification, approximation, and concepts whose ultimate coherence we cannot establish. These insights form the backbone of Nietzsche's naturalism, the epistemological aspect of which transforms our basic understanding of cognition and science. The central implications that follow are that cognition can succeed without correspondence between mind and world and that the standard assumption thought to be absolutely indispensible for science, that the world is fundamentally ordered, or a cosmos, is unnecessary. On Nietzsche's naturalistic view, the measure of cognitive and scientific success is our ability to order phenomena, not our ability to discover order in nature itself.</p>
