<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Rise and Fall of the Proletarian Utopias By Goetz A. Briefs, Georgetown University* PROUDHON once remarked--and Cortez eagerly took up the idea-that in the Western world all great intellectual and moral issues derive, fundamentally, from theological sources. In the past, and even today, Western thought has received and is receiving a tremendous impetus from the secularization of religious and theological doctrines. The Christian doctrines of salvation, of the kingdom of God, of the visio beatifica in a Paradise of happiness and perfect concord, have always led men not only to envision but even to plan an earthly millenium. With the rise of anthropocentric humanism the theological bases of these conceptions were swept away. Man and his powers superseded them. Man, endowed with reason, freedom and a desire for happiness, was made the focal point of history and of nature. More than that: Man was considered naturally good and capable of infinite perfection. All the evil in the world was attributed to institutions, especially to those which curtail man's freedom and to those which transcend reason. Civil authorities and institutions were accused of fostering the unworthy fictions of subordination and obedience to man- made laws. Ecclesiastical authorities and institutions were charged with inculcating superstitious beliefs in religion as e.g. original sin. The humanists asserted that these superstitions and fictions prevent man from realizing his supreme good, which, according to them, consists in the achievement of his full stature as a free, rational, and progressive being. They were convinced that, if freedom and equality were per- mitted to rule unhampered, all discords and social evils would vanish from the earth, man would scale ineffable heights of perfection, and goods in infinite abundance would be at hand to satisfy man's needs. It was not thought too optimistic to believe that even death might be conquered. This is the humanist's picture of man and his capacities. * Les confessions d'un Re'6olutionnaire, Paris 1849, p. 61.

The form in which this criticism is expressed is a picture of a better world. This picture may be painted in the glaring colors of pure imagination or in the somber hues of a possible world-a world whose only condition for actualization is the good-will of people and of states- men or ruling classes. Utopias may be depicted either as future worlds which are to evolve automatically or as future worlds which are to be constructed only after a deep metanoeite following the oft predicted catastrophe of our civilization. The Marxian forecast of the coming Socialism and Communism belongs in the former category, whereas Claude St. Martin, Bonald, Cortez and even Ozanam predicted the rise of a Christian Millenium upon the ashes of our ruined civilization. In the 18th century conditions for the appearance of Utopias and social constructivism were exceedingly favorable. Higher and lower ranks of society alike were thoroughly dissatisfied with the political, social and cultural situation of the late Absolutism. The spokesmen of this dissatisfaction were the philosophers of that period and the ecrivains, a group of secularized thinkers who were animated by hostil- ity toward the existing order and by hatred and contempt for what they regarded as the moral and spiritual backbone of this order, viz. the Church. The natural law of the Enlightenment and the absolute humanism constituted the intellectual basis of this social criticism, while its yardstick was composed of the concepts of individual freedom, equality of men, man's natural goodness and the institutional origin of evil. The great expectations arising from the belief in the infinite per- fectibility of man and his capacity for infinite progress stimulated the construction of Utopias. Man's courage and enterprise had expanded the limits of the world tremendously. The physical boun- daries of the confined medieval world had been replaced by new and far-reaching borders. Furthermore, there were scientific and techno- logical discoveries, which engendered widespread doubt that human reason and perfectibility were limited. The power of human reason seemed to be infinite, and this belief gave rise to a general spirit of self-confidence and optimism. Most thinkers of that day, in their Promethean hybris, ignored the existence of human limitations, and</page><page sequence="3">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS 33 some of them were convinced of the possibility of a perfectly har- monious human society, which could enjoy everlasting life here on earth amid immeasurable plenty. Godwin e.g. shared the belief in the possibility of an everlasting human life, and in our own day Mr. Strachey does not absolutely reject this possibility. The one condition necessary for the adjustment of society to a perfect equilibrium was thought to be unrestricted freedom for everybody. In no other period were social reformers and utopians so numerous as in this one. Never, we have to add, did any period offer oppor- tunities so perfectly conducive to the social localization of utopias. In fact, a utopia is only a literary affair unless it stirs the interest and imagination of a social group which adopts the utopia as its creed. Utopian ideas mean nothing until they inspire a social movement. Then, indeed, they may become the dynamite which blows a whole world to bits. The interest to which the 18th century utopias appealed was that of the rising bourgeoisie. After the bourgeoisie had come to power and industrialism had been established, new utopias were devised with a new social localization. The proletarian utopias succeeded the bourgeois utopias. This shift did not imply a complete change in the fundamentals of the utopias. The new social criticism attacked the bourgeois society from the standpoint of the laboring poor and of all miserables. The fact that it started from the accepted values and utopian ideals of the bourgeoisie indicates the vigor and relentlessness of this criticism. In fact, it fed upon the bourgeois world-view and secularism. Workers' groups, therefore, which, for some reason or other, did not adopt the bourgeois philosophy and ethics of life, failed to produce a proletarian utopia. This explains why the rising proletarian utopias were restricted to certain areas and confined to certain well-circumscribed groups. The early French socialism is proof of the fact that the bourgeois philosophy of life, its belief in the perfectibility, progress and sovereignty of man served as the breeding ground of proletarian utopias. The new criticism was thoroughly honeycombed with the concepts of human freedom, equality, reason and good-will. A harmonious social reconstruction seemed to be only a matter of insight on the</page><page sequence="4">34 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS part of the ruling groups. Designs for new social orders characterized by harmony and abundance cropped up like mushrooms after a rain- fall. The social reformers were legion. We need only mention Fourier, Cabet, the St. Simonists, Proudhon, Weitling. They were all convinced that they dealt with a reality just around the corner, and they would have been indignant had their ideas been termed utopian. The early French socialists were the first to revise the picture of the bourgeois utopian that had been painted by the "philosophers." They introduced a change in viewpoint and their starting-point was criticism of the existing socio-economic order. These socialists discovered the class character of the bourgeois society and the privileged position of property owners, industrialists and financiers. They stressed the fact that revolutionary liberties were the aces in bourgeois hand. They pointed out that the root of all social evil was the system of property ownership which excluded great social groups from the possibility of a free and decent life. It was precisely because these socialists accepted the values of the Enlightenment philosophers that they objected to the existing social and political order. No doubt, they added very realistic features to the analysis of modern society, but the main function remained the same, viz., to raise the poor and the miserables-whom they did not entirely identify with the worker-to the position of a human being rather than to proclaim the bourgeois the "man." They looked upon the rights and liberties of the Great Revolution as so many privileges acquired by the bourgeoisie. True freedom and equality for all had still to be won. For them, the key to the new social order was the overthrow of private property and the organization of labor, of credit, of produc- tion, etc. None of the great Enlightenment goals and tenets of free- dom, equality, humanity, progress and harmony was abandoned. On the contrary, all these remained as fervent beliefs. The optimism, so characteristic of Enlightenment thought, still prevailed, and its source was most certainly Rousseau. Indeed, French socialism transformed the bourgeois myth into a myth of the poor, of the miserables, of the bas peuple and to a certain extent even at this early date into a myth of the proletariat. The Church had been teaching for centuries that the poor man had</page><page sequence="5">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS 35 his rights and his rank in the social order, which could not be justly denied him. It was this doctrine that provided material for the con- struction of the socialist myth of the poor. The rise of modem indus- trialism together with the mechanism of the new economic order had rendered these claims of the poor inoperable. The impersonalism of a market society where free competition ruled supreme obviously left no room for the claims of persons against persons. Here was a society geared to self-interest. Every other ethical attitude had to give way. Hence, every appeal that the rich show compassion for the poor fell on deaf ears. The world was entangled in the meshes of an impersonal mechanism which forced every man to look out only for his own interests. Moreover, the myth of the miserables appeared at a time when the bourgeois myth was evolving into a pragmatic philosophy of utility. This evolution had been in progress ever since the establishment of the bourgeois society upon the principles of freedom, self-interest and free competition. The old myth of harmony and humanity had been dispelled and there remained in its place naught but the conflicts of the market, self-interest and tension between rich and poor. Never- theless, the phraseology of the myth still prevailed. Although the ideology had become unreal, it was still very suitable for festive occa- sions and as a balm for uneasy consciences. It was precisely because the dead bourgeois myth had assumed these functions that the myth of the miserables came upon the scene. The champions of the mis- erables pinned the bourgeoisie down on the values and formulas which they professed, and made it clear to them that it was only private prop- erty, profit-seeking and competition that hindered the establishment of social harmony, equality, peace and universal freedom. They appealed to the intellectual insight and sense of social justice of the ruling class. They offered them their blue-prints for the new and better order. Thus far the early French socialists. And then Marx appeared on the stage. He cursed them all as utopians and tellers-of-fairy-tales and pummeled them with arguments so telling that they could be refuted only with the greatest difficulty. In the Communist Manifesto Marx summarized his objections</page><page sequence="6">36 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS against these French socialists under the heading: Critical Utopian Socialists. Here he calls them "inventors of systems." He says they perceive the class antagonisms and they have knowledge of the dis- solving elements present in the existing society but they are blind to the historical activity of the proletariat and its will to form a political movement of its own. They see in the proletariat a suffering and mis- erable people whom they seek to help, but they fail to realize that the emancipation of the proletariat can come only from itself. Marx asserts that these early socialists ignored the material conditions of the libera- tion of the proletariat; that they were ignorant of the fact that society develops by means of antagonisms-dialectically-and on the basis of material conditions. Marx is convinced that it is this ignorance on their part that leads them to search for a social science and social laws. As a result they overlook the reality of the class struggle which is pro- ceeding apace with the development of industrialization. Instead of analyzing the class struggle they construct systems; in place of the historical conditions of the proletarian emancipation, they devise all sorts of phantastic conditions; they substitute a blue-print of an ideal society for a slowly emerging proletarian self-consciousness and self- activity. For these utopians, the history of society resolves itself into propaganda of their ideas and the practical fulfilment of their plans. They resent all revolutionary tactics and all political goals on the part of the workers. At best they rely on some small experiments with socialistic and communistic communities and hope that the successful example of these will inspire imitation. But the development of indus- trialism and of the proletariat wipes out all these lofty utopias. In this process of development critical utopian socialism will be pushed aside as just another sect which either tends toward outright reactionism or joins forces with bourgeois conservatism. In either case it will be obliterated as being both reactionary and utopian. It is in this way that Marx dissects and criticizes what he calls Critical Utopian Socialism. The Marxian doctrine of the development of capitalistic society is at pains to draw a sharp line of demarcation between itself and every kind of utopism. Marxism claims to be scientific socialism. Therefore, it summarily rejects all wish-dreams, ethics and rationalistic construc-</page><page sequence="7">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS 37 tions. The starting point of this scientific socialism is man as he, in cooperation with his fellowmen, provides his food, clothing, shelter and other means of subsistence. The forms of cooperation are determ- ined fundamentally by the prevailing techniques of production. They determine what Marx calls the production relations. They also determ- ine what Marx calls the superstructure, i.e. the laws, the culture, the philosophy, the ethics and the religion of the respective societies. The material technique of securing and improving livelihood constitute the 'Realfactoren' of history. Here then is the reason why Marx so often uses the term Materialism in connection with his approach to the analysis of history. According to Marx, history develops dialectically, i.e. through antagonisms Class interests are the "materia" of these antagonisms. The capitalistic age, based on machine production, is characterized by the antagonism between the bourgeoisie as property owners and exploiters and the proletariat as dispossessed and exploited. The interests of these groups diverge fundamentally. The thought of the capitalist centers around property, accumulation and profits; the thought of the worker centers around social property and maximum returns for the benefit of all. Marx contends that in the womb of the capitalistic society conditions gradually mature to the point where they are optimal for the revolutionary transformation of the capitalistic society into the socialistic order. In the end-crisis of capitalism the immense mass of non-owners is to expropriate the propertied classes, which are relatively small. The task of materializing ideals does not devolve upon the proletariat. On the contrary, its sole function is to set free the elements of the new society which have developed in the womb of the old. It has only to remove the deeds and titles to private property in the means of productions--deeds and titles that have become hindrances to full capacity production and to the best mode of distribution. Socialism thus appears as a fruit matured by the necessary dynamics of capitalism. The proletarian function is to organize and to await The Day. The objective dynamism of history automatically produces a socio-economic order that corresponds to the proletarian interest in a human order, and this takes place on a world-wide basis. Only now does the proletarian become a human being and cease to be a mere commodity. Only now is human labor free and its organiza-</page><page sequence="8">38 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS tion the expression of human reason. Therewith the realm of Necessity is traversed and the realm of Freedom won. Class struggles anad wars disappear with the institutional ground that supports them, with cap- italistic private property and profits. The immense productive power of the world is placed at the service of all. The old superstructure of the capitalistic order "withers away"-the state, the old laws, the church and ethics-all these vanish and make room for freedom, abundance, equality and harmony. Marx escaped the temptation to a detailed elaboration of the beauties and perfections of this world to come. He left it to his follow- ers to imagine and describe this future order. His friend Fr. Engels indulged in such imaginative excursions more than he, but Engels was outdone in this respect by Bebel, Stem, Morris, Douai and others. Many of these works became best-sellers. Bebel's Frau was more popu- lar in Germany than Marx's Das Kapital. The great success of these books is evidence of the proletariat's need for such escape-literature and its longing for the establishment of the new order rather than for Marx's criticisms of the old. We would be badly mistaken, however, if we were to assume that Marx succeeded in escaping utopism. The very fact that his doctrine gave rise to this utopian literature is itself an indication that his doc- trine contained utopian elements. Indeed, Marxism, despite all its realistic and materialistic "aplomb," is fundamentally utopian. Its utopism is entailed partly in its premises, partly in its eschatology and prophecy of the coming society. I venture to say that Marx advanced a far shorter distance beyond the Enlightenment thinking and the bourgeois fundamentals of world and life than most people realize. Without wishing unduly to minimize Hegel's influence on Marx, we are forced to assert that Marx was and always remained a child of the 18th century, as far as leading values and aspects are concerned. His decisive image of man was bequeathed to him by his father, a devotee of Locke, Voltaire, Rousseau and Lessing. It is a well known and established fact that old Heinrich Marx introduced his son to this French literature and imbued his mind with the philosophical anthrop- ology which was rampant at the time, i.e. the Enlightenment tenets</page><page sequence="9">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS 39 concerning man. It is needless to add that these tenets were accepted by all the progressive minds of that period. Voltaire's works were best- sellers after the French Revolution! Cf. Gurian.* We have but to turn to Proudhon and the history of St. Simonism for proof that Marxism is a final step in the development of this Enlightenment philosophy-a step whose main function has been to popularize basic Enlightenment ideas and to adapt them to mass desires and mass ambitions. The significance of Marx can be shown in the following way: In the first place, he perceived more clearly than any of the French social- ists the strength and the historical necessity of the capitalistic order. He clearly stated the class conflict and elevated it to the rank of his- torical necessity. Translated into class terms, the rich become "capital- ists," the poor "proletarians." At this point, Marx accepts, in his terminology, the impersonalism which industrial society implied in its market structure. Every personalistic claim and every personalistic expression of claims disappears. The question is reduced to one of classes in conflict: it is no longer one of the "poor" making their needs known to the "rich." There is no longer any room for ethical pathos. There is only room for an analysis of the objective class relationship within the mechanism of the capitalistic development. This capital- istic order revolves around material interests, property, profits and accumulation-in short, around the rules of the game of an acquisitive society. Therefore, an analysis of this capitalistic order must necessarily be a materialistic one. Whither do these material interests working in competitive markets push the industrial society? Marx comes to the conclusion that the process of concentration must necessarily destroy the middle classes. Moreover, the capitalist class itself is sub- ject to a selective process which decimates its ranks. The survivors grow in strength and economic power. As a result of this selective and destructive process, the proletariat will increase in numbers but not in consumptive power. The gap between these two elements causes cyclical crises. Every new crisis enlarges the cleavage between classes and intensifies their conflicts. At the one pole of society all the wealth * W. Gurian: Die politischen und socialen Ideen des franzoesischen Katholizismus, Miinchen-Gladbach, 1929. pp. 84 and 346.</page><page sequence="10">40 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS accumulates, while at the other all the destitution and poverty. Since the State is only an instrument for the protection of the capitalists against the claims of the proletariat, it cannot exercise the office of mediator in these struggles between the two opposing powers. Marx predicts a tremendous end-crisis in which physical force will decide the issue. The victorious proletariat will seize power and expropriate the expropriators. According to Marx, all this is bound to happen because of the dynamics of inescapable social laws. These things he predicted with the accuracy of an astronomer predicting a solar eclipse. In the second place, Marx saw more clearly than any of the French socialists that the bourgeois myth of economic freedom and peaceful competition was really a class myth. He discovered bourgeois interests concealed behind the lofty terminology of liberty and human rights. And he realized that the existing system of competition favored the "Haves" against the "Have-nots." He observed that the real issue was the economic power of a privileged class and not general welfare or the greatest happiness for the greatest number. He was convinced that the old phrases about humanity and social harmony were but a smoke-screen used to hide the real issues: expansion of economic power and unlimited exploitation. Marx took grim pleasure in debunking, one by one, the tenets of economic liberalism and in exposing with a thoroughness inspired by hatred all the brutal realities which had marked the decades of rising industrialism. The utopian language which the bourgeoisie had inherited from the Enlightenment, served as the yardstick of his criticism. A harsh indictment of the capitalistic system, disguised as objective statements, became unavoidable. The merciless "J'accuse" which Marx hurled at the bourgeoisie betrayed his own belief in those values and ideas for which the bourgeoisie ideol- ogically stood: freedom, equality, universal social harmony, progress, humanity. Both his passions and his scholarship are focused on this problem, viz. how will man once and for all succeed in becoming the kind of being he is to be? The raising of this question from a purely immanent standpoint unmistakably reveals a mind that accepts the ten- ets and values of absolute humanism. Indeed, Marxism is the final link in the chain of thought which leads from the Christian chiliasm through the millenium-expectations to the Enlightenment philosophy. Each</page><page sequence="11">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS 41 link is another step toward the secularization of the western mind- toward the sovereignty of man. The climax is reached in L. Feuer- bach's proclamation that God is a mere anthropomorphism; the belief in him indicates that man's self-determination has not as yet been fully realized. Whatever may have separated them in other respects, Proud- hon, Marx and Engels were agreed on this point. This climax, how- ever, was also' the perepetic in this dramatic development: for man's sovereignty became increasingly submerged in a dynamic process of "Realfactorem." The abandonment of a personalistic theology neces- sarily implied the doom of a personalistic anthropology. The Marxian Utopia is identical with the one previously presented by the Enlightenment philosophy. The one difference is this, that Marx tied up the emancipation of mankind with the emancipation of an oppressed class, which in its turn was to effect the emancipation of all. This emancipation of the proletarian class is the product of an historical process which is itself materialistically determined. This lat- ter element seemed to add a realistic twist to Marx's philosophy of the emancipation. But the truth is that this element itself proved to be more utopian than the assumption the philosophers had made. Accord- ing to them, the emancipation depended on a free and reasonable human decision and insight, whereas, according to Marx, it is an unintended product of blind, automatic materialistic processes. This is certainly more utopian than the philosophical conception. Let us note at this point the Enlightenment optimism behind this Marxian belief in the materialistic process as the Demiurgos of universal social harmony. It is useless to raise the objection that Marx was only analyzing the facts and tendencies of Capitalism and that he found them converging toward an historical situation which offers the prole- tariat their great chance to overthrow the capitalist order. This argu- ment is wholly beside the point. It is entirely un-marxian because it lacks the element of materialistic necessity. Socialism does not suddenly spring up because of some lucky chance making its appearance at the right moment. Socialism, according to Marx, arrives because it is pre- formed and pre-determined in the evolution of capitalism. It matures within the womb of the capitalistic society. It does not depend upon the will of any social class. As a matter of fact, the Marxian doctrine</page><page sequence="12">42 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS of socialism has as little need for social localization as a forecast of a solar eclipse has. If any class at all has anything to do with its coming, certainly it is the capitalist class rather than the proletarian, because, according to Marx, the capitalists' desire for profit realizes the condi- tions of socialism. It would be easy to demonstrate that the implicit utopism of Marx gave rise to a great number of explicit utopias. As we noted before, Marx abstained from describing the new order, but many of his follow- ers did not. These utopian apocryphas-the socialistic scribes always refused to acknowledge this literature as authentic-are the continua- tion of a branch of literature which leads, on the side of bourgeois liberalism, to the exaltations of Bastiat, on the side of the French socialists, to the scurrilities of Fourier, on the side of the German pre- Marxian thinkers to Weitling's phantasies, and in England to Godwin. The impetus which these utopias gave the labor movement cannot be exaggerated. They offered a gospel of salvation and emancipation to the prole- tariat of the first generation, to these helpless and hopeless masses caught in the meshes of modem industrialism and of the modem market society. This gospel satisfied their longings, clarified their his- torical position and elevated them to the honor of a universal human mission. It offered the solution of their sufferings, but at the same time it showed them the meaning and significance of their sufferings for mankind. In fact, it parallelled very closely the Christian doctrine of vicarious suffering, not altogether forgotten. These utopias elevated proletarian self-consciousness by suggesting that only proletarians have a Gnosis of things to come, things whose meaning no other class could possibly grasp, because the social and economic position of all other classes precludes the possibility of their visualizing and understanding the factors which make for socialism. The fact that the proletarians knew what the bourgeois did not know and could not understand when explained to him meant a great deal at least to German socialists. This esoteric knowledge consists in a realization that capitalism is doomed and that the future belongs to the proletariat. For millions sunk in insecurity, privations, humiliations, and despair,</page><page sequence="13">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS 43 these utopias replaced Christianity as their faith. It must also be emphasized that millions of people were brought through Marxism into the clutches of the materialistic and atheistic philosophy of the Enlightenment. Marxism was the nexus between the 18th century and the social movement of the 19th. It preached from the house-tops to the masses what the 18th century had whispered in the salons of the chosen few. At the present time this proletarian utopism has fallen into decay. Its beginnings must be sought in an earlier period. Since the War this decay has taken on catastrophic and panicky forms. The gradual decay began with certain elements in the Marxian doctrine itself, which tended to dampen the fervor of the utopian expectations. There was the fact that Marx was wrong about the imminence of the downfall of capitalism. He had expected it-watch in hand-as early as 1848, then again in 1857, then in 1871 (Paris Commune) and finally in 1873. Each crisis might be the end-crisis, but each one went by without bringing the end. Instead of bringing the end of capitalism, it brought a new upswing to capitalism. Such dis- appointments could not serve to increase the faith of the Marxian followers. Furthermore, the Marxian thesis concerning the maturation of the conditions of socialism caused a similar disappointment. Dispute was possible and was eagerly started concerning the meaning and the criteria of this maturation process. Even among Marxist writers it was obviously very difficult to reach a consensus of opinion. Owing to the world-wide upswing of industrialism in the 90's and the new trends which Marx did not foresee, such as imperialism, monopoly-capitalism and comprehensive social legislation, simple faith in the imminence of socialism was put to a hard test. The situation is well expressed in the words of Bernstein: The goal means nothing to us, the movement is everything. Some of the developments Marx had predicted did not work out true to form, e.g. concentration, the disappearance of the middle classes, leaving only a clear-cut dualistic class structure, increase in the extent and destructivencss of crises, enlargement of the industrial reserve army and greater sufferings for the working classes. All this did not happen as predicted. On the contrary, proletarian conditions</page><page sequence="14">44 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS of life improved considerably. Consequently the great catastrophe had to be postponed-rather, it postponed itself. In the meantime the early generation of proletarian faithful died off; the younger one grew up under changed conditions. The scribes of the cataclysm of capitalism continued to discuss the historical manometer and the degree of maturity of the capitalistic system necessary for the swing over to socialism. In such an atmosphere utopian faith cannot thrive-to put it mildly. The changed conditions of proletarian life, especially since the 90's, were responsible, more than any other factor or set of factors, for the gradual decline of utopism. The political as well as the eco- nomic organization of the proletariat was in full bloom. The trade unions were fostered by Marxism as the schools of socialism. Both these and the Marxian workers parties should spread socialism among the masses from the viewpoint of the pending catastrophe of the capital- istic society. This would have been all right if the catastrophe had really been pending. But it was not. Instead, capitalism grew stronger and developed greater capacities for the improvement of the prole- tarian's conditions of life than had ever been expected. Social legisla- tion and social security acts found a place within the existing social framework, and unexpected opportunities for trade union activities and successes were presented. This, of course, meant greater emphasis on the present and its economic and political possibilities for labor than seemed compatible with the doctrine of the socialistic future. To be sure, this shift of emphasis was made originally with a good socialistic con- science. Every opportunity offered by capitalism for the improvement of the workers' lot in life certainly ought to be taken. This attitude seemed to be good Marxism. But when this policy produced great and obvious gains, the tasks immediately at hand took on added importance and weight, and so did the institutions and groups performing these tasks. The socialist parties observed this trend with increasing un- easiness and, at times, even with alarm. In the long run, however, it turned out that the unionized masses formed the solid substructure of the parties themselves; they maneuvered their leaders into public life and secured power for the unions in the political movement. Finally the party itself had to surrender to a more practical and matter-of-fact</page><page sequence="15">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS 45 policy. It had to press for social legislation because the masses wanted it. But socialist pressure for social legislation implies socialist belief in the possibility and usefulness of such legislation under a capitalistic order and within our present political set-up. However dogmatically the parties emphasized the impossibility of emancipating the workers under the capitalistic system, they could not escape dipping into the reality of capitalism and of the present state. They found out that things were not entirely as the Marxian dogmatic would have them. The process of gradual withdrawal from the narrow Marxian dogmatic, a process well under way in the trade unions-could not but influence the political representation of labor. With misgivings and obstruction it was accepted by those who had stuck to the Marxian guns. These latter won easy victories in the party conventions and rallies, but they lost out wherever practical work had to be done, as in trade unions, cooperatives, in social security institutions, especially in health insur- ance. In all these cases the same question was sure to arise: To what extent can we cooperate with the present political and business powers? To what will this cooperation lead? To what degree is it compatible with our socialistic tenets? Would Marx have approved of it? (There was evidence that he had favored social legislation in his Inaugural Address of 1864, and the group that favored social legislation was not slow to emphasize this point.) Men like Bebel and Liebknecht could not help sensing the deviation from the dogmatic line and realizing that the old generation was on its way out and the new one on its way in. This new generation, brought up in the trade-union viewpoint and under rather successful social legislation, apparently was not con- tent with mere negative criticism and with waiting, as it were, in the ante-chamber of destiny and of things to come. With the increased strength of unions and the increased votes of the social democrats, their self-consciousness and self-assertion grew, and along with them their will to do here and now what they thought fit. This new generation found no pleasure in waiting for the utopia. One may even say that this generation did not need the hope and the faith which the older generation had needed. Moreover, this generation, unlike the old, had not been brought up as a whole in a religious faith, and consequently it had never been impressed with the categories of any deep-seated</page><page sequence="16">46 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS belief. To this generation it seemed that if socialism would come, let it come. In the meantime, however, they would improve their conditions of life in every possible way. Un "j ai" vaut mieux que deux "tu auras." As a result, the function of the utopia changed. It used to be a faith and a promise dear to the disinherited and to the underdog in both political and social life. Now it became a yardstick for criticism and a measure for desires and claims raised against the existing order. Step by step the younger generation fought on the basis of the existing order, which profoundly affected the character of that generation. As the labor movement grew it became institutionalized, built up its bureaucracy, its funds, its far-flung offices. With each of these develop- ments it sank its roots deeper and deeper into the existing world. Naturally enough, these institutions created vested interests. The political and the trade union movement both established connections with the dominant powers in public and in business life. These rela- tions were indicative of the new attitude which saw in the state some- thing more than an instrument in the hands of the ruling class, and which became aware of the fact that employers were not exclusively profit-making animals. The complexity of the capitalistic world threat- ened and later destroyed all the handsome generalizations that were so well adapted to agitation: surplus value, class conflict, the govern- ment as a tool of the bourgeoisie, etc. I remember a well-known personality of the socialist movement telling me during the war, "Well, it will take us a long time to get the Marxian phrases out of the heads of our followers." This man belonged to that group in close contact with the complexities of political and economic life who had lost faith in the Marxian doctrine, which they regarded as a menace to a sound labor movement. We need not emphasize that, because so many per- sonal interests were bound up in the existing order, the leaders and officials of the socialist movement directed their thoughts toward the reform, rather than the overthrow, of the established system. The institutions which the socialist labor movement had built up had given thousands of their number an opportunity to rise to higher social strata. A workers' elite had made its appearance. No matter how their social problems were solved for the time being, they need not abandon the essentials of their creed, for they could still calmly await the</page><page sequence="17">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS 47 emergence of the socialistic society. Moreover, the utopia was still a useful instrument for purposes of propaganda, a means to ipater le bourgeois and to edify congresses. It might even be said with justifi- cation that the average socialist leader, somehow or other, still believed in it, but instead of being the central point of the socialist creed it was now assuming the character of a means for the achievement of various ends. The force of circumstances and the successes enjoyed by the established institutions caused an influx of conservatism into the ranks of the leaders of both party and economic organizations. This development occurred wherever Marxian socialism had been successful. The classical example is the German one. Marxian ideas had been the motive force behind the German labor movement, and Marxian dogmas had inspired its passionate aggressiveness. Conse- quently, the first period of the German socialist movement is character- ized by untempered radicalism and rigorous faith in every word of the Holy Book, Das Kapital. The party high command looked with marked uneasiness at the developing trade unions, at least in so far as they favored collective bargaining, cooperatives and an organization which rested on this capitalistic "terra damnata." Once established, however, these economic organizations secured for themselves the right of relative autonomy, at Mannheim, e.g. the trade unions, in 1906. With the outbreak of the War, however, the period of gradual drifting away from the utopia came to an end. At the outbreak of the War, the ties which had slowly bound the socialist labor movement to the state were suddenly and clearly mani- fested-to the great surprise of all concerned. The distribution of power was plainly indicated by the fact that the socialist unions con- sented to support the government before the social democratic party had even had a chance to consider the problem. Of course, the party followed suit. It is reported on reliable authority that for three days Lenin refused to believe this betrayal of Marxian principles. This is evidence of the hard blow which the party and the unions dealt the old guard. After this step had once been taken, everything else developed automatically--ever closer cooperation with the government and the military authorities, and of course between unions and employ-</page><page sequence="18">48 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS ers. As the war progressed, radical orthodoxy was revived, but with little success. Its last chance came in November, 1918, but after a period of wavering, the social democratic party, powerfully backed by the G. F. of L., got the upper hand and succeeded in establishing the Weimar Republic, hand in hand with the bourgeois parties. As it turned out, the ultima Thule of German socialism was democracy plus social reform. The utopia was definitely dead as far as the millions who were organized in the Social Democratic Party and the G. F. of L. were concerned. The communist party became the repository of the surviving dogmas of Marxism - a party which often received its impetus and inspiration from Russia. But one can say that even the Communist Party was devoid of utopism. The only Marxian element that remained was the proletarian aim to overthrow the capitalistic order in favor of a workers' regime with the hope that the capitalistic order in other parts of the world would be undermined by their action. The clearest lesson taught by the Russian experiment was this, that no automatic dynamism transformed into realities the wish-dreams in which the 18th century philosophers and, with them, Marx had indulged. Consequently, only at times and for limited groups of the European proletariat could bolshevism revive the Utopian expectations. Alluring power, however, it had more as an exciting experiment than as a real fulfillment. The European worker, as a rule, had already a stake in the present political and socio-economic set-up; moreover, he "knew" too much to be easily carried away by the ideals Russia stood for. He had already attained much more than Bolshevism had to offer him, and he felt that he had already too much of what Russia so enthusiastically strove for: technical progress and industrialism. He possibly could not share the lyrics of a machine age Russia voiced. And last but not least: the picture of man, the whole philosophical anthropology of Bolshevism and its methods to realize it, had no appeal for the overwhelming masses of European workers. Conse- quently Bolshevism was only a casual temptation for Europe. The final break-down of the proletarian utopia started from two sides. First the image of man, which absolute humanism had developed and which, for more than a century, had exerted its charm and its persuasive power, had spent its attractiveness and had exhausted its</page><page sequence="19">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS 49 promise. Freedom, political equality, social rights and social prestige had been won in Europe outside of Russia and was the normal thing. While attacking the concrete problems of proletarian mass-life the labor organizations struck upon the laws of economic and social gravity; this disillusioned the utopian expectations. Secondly, the Marxian finality of material factors tending to produce the new socialistic order eo ipso implied the impossible feature of an occasion- alism without Providence, which indeed proved a wicked optimism. Hegel's idea of "progress in the consciousness of freedom" had more justification, and still more justification had French socialism in assum- ing that human reason could build up a realm more humane than the existing one. Marx however, eliminated both Providence and human reason as creative and constitutive factors; instead he attributed to material processes the ultimate salvation of man. This is the pro- foundest utopia thinkable. If the future of the proletariat and of mankind hinges on blind material processes, then only one prediction can safely be made: that man will be pulverized by these blind and irrational forces. The end of the proletarian utopia in many European countries involved a tragic feature in that certain elements of Marxian thought survived the utopian dreams. Most important in this respect were the Marxian dogmatics of exploitation and of surplus value. It led to exaggerations in wage policy and in social legislation; it prevented every attempt to establish better relations between employees and employers, based on confidence and loyalty. Another element which survived was the underestimation of the middle classes both urban and rural. It prevented the Weimar republic from fully realizing the political weight and the capacity to riot of these groups. Social legis- lation and taxation could burden the middle classes with increased levies, but they could not hinder them from charging every mishap to the socialist account nor from identifying the Weimar republic with Marxism. The elements of Marxism that survived the utopia became so many rallying points of forces hostile to Weimar and to Marxism alike. The end is history well known to everybody. Fascism submerged</page><page sequence="20">50 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS all proletarian organizations, all the rights and strongholds labor had built up in two generations. It outlawed every claim of labor to speak in its own name; it outlawed even the name that had been the class- mark of labor, the name "proletarian." Without a struggle the tower- ing power of labor yielded to the totalitarian state. The myth of the race or of the totalitarian state readily replaced both the bourgeois and the proletarian myth. The proletarian utopia vanished with the philosophical anthro- pology of humanism. Humanism had been the fertile soil on which many gospels of man grew, and under the tenets of absolute humanism all of them had deified man and mankind--our western soil stamped by the intrinsic categories of Christian theology could not help transform- ing the secularization of man into his deification. This was the end of the theology of the One, the Personal, the Trinitarian God who created man after his likeness. Since then everything was left to the graceless forces from below, and necessarily drifted toward the human -all too human--of Nietzsche. Man increasingly confessed and took pride in being subject to natural laws and their dynamics. Marx dared establish the philosophy of society on the ground of inescapable laws -but in following a humanistic motif he undertook to save the image of man by assuming that the socio-economic process ultimately would emancipate man and save the dignity of man. It is exactly this human- istic element which became submerged in the present shift toward con- fessed anti-humanism. The great pseudo-theology which indeed human- ism was, drew to an end. It had unconsciously fed on the Christian theology which, as a living social force, it simultaneously destroyed. The genuine end-crisis which we witness today is not the one Marx had dreamed of-the end-crisis leading to the emancipation of man from all forms of self-estrangement. It is indeed the end crisis of humanism, a crisis which dooms both Rousseau and Marx.</page></plain_text>
