<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVIDENCE FOR ETRUSCAN-PUNIC RELATIONS The menace of Etruscan and Carthaginian "piracy" to Western Greek and Roman shipping is frequently cited by historians, but evidenced only in a few ancient battles. Phoenician and Punic trade goods reached most markets of the Mediterranean, and especially those of the West (even Greek Massilia, traditional rival of Carthage), while Etruscan pottery and bronzes occur in many Greek and native sites in the West, Ionia, and the Aegean. Evidence from archaeological contexts can now be analyzed for indications of the actual associations between Etruscan states and the Carthaginian empire. Aristotle (Pol. 3-5.10-11) is the only ancient author to cite a deliberate, official alliance between Etruscans and the Punic or Carthaginian empire. His reference seems to indicate the existence of written documents (graphai) concerning trade and military agreements. The description by Herodotus (1.166-167) of the battle over Alalia (ca. 535 B.C.) probably records the operation of such an association between Carthage and the Etruscan city-state of Caere. A few other ancient literary sources may attest to similar alliances, but have lacunae or confusions because their authors were somewhat ignorant of Etruscan and Carthaginian his- tory. The preserved works of antiquity record no spokesmen for either of the two cultures so alien to their Greek and Roman rivals for the western Medi- terranean.1 The archaeological record of trade goods in sites of the two cultures is already much more ex- tensive than the historical references, and in the next decade it should grow rapidly. One result of my research, completed in 1974,2 is a list of trade goods indicating Etruscan-Carthaginian contact and possibly cooperation. This includes only objects verified in publications, or identified through personal examination. It is almost certain that other items from archaeological contexts are attributable to Etruscan or Punic manufacture, but their origins cannot (yet) be proven. Many of the artifacts that characterize Etruscan or Carthaginian culture never occur in contexts outside their homelands (e.g., terra- cotta female protomes associated with the cult of the Punic goddess Tanit). Most characteristic of Etruscan trade goods are bucchero pottery and bronze utensils and sculpture. Punic goods are usually athyrmata (luxury items of oriental design), or amphorae of 1 Historical sources in chronological order of the events they describe: I. Arist.

See Colozier, MEFR 64 (I952) 59-65- 3Not included in this list are several objects which have otherwise been cited as relevant to Etruscan-Punic commerce: i) The pottery deposit in the Tanit sanctuary, Carthage, contains vases decorated in Proto-Corinthian style, which are not Etruscan in origin and seem similar in fabric to locally produced Punic vases. See also Cintas, Ceramique punique (1950) 490-504f1. 2) A "cippus" now in the tophet at Carthage, identified as Etruscan (Pallottino, ArchCl 16 [19641 14), has scars on its upper portion as though a wider top section had been broken off. It must originally have been quite different in shape. 3) Terra-cotta "banquetters" figurines, from Tunisia (Colo- zier, MEFR 65 [1953] 67) are most probably Roman in date, not Etruscan. 4) Etruscan inscriptions from Bir Mcherga, Tunisia, are probably boundary stones erected by immigrants in the Roman period who may have been Etruscan ethnics. See J. Heurgon, CRAI 1969, 526-51. 5) A terra-cotta reclining figure sarcophagus and imitation Corinthian pottery from Motya cannot now be located and are of doubtful provenance. (See Whitaker, Motya [1921] 238-39, and Colozier, MEFR 65 [19531 74.) 6) A bronze siren figurine from Menorca is probably Greek, not Etruscan (as are many other Spanish bronze finds). See Garcia y Bellido, Ars Hispaniae I (1947) 187. Many other examples of pottery and bronzes have been variously identified as Etruscan but cannot be so termed with certainty. The Punic trade probably supplied oriental com- modities such as incense, ivory, ostrich eggs, Phoenician glass, and the like to Etruria, but since these were not necessarily manufactured in Carthage, they are not listed in this article.

Its manufacture in the Adriatic region may in- dicate Punic interest there just prior to the wars with Rome. The presence of a sarcophagus (no. 5) representing a Punic priest or suppliant in a third-century Etruscan family tomb is another unusual phenomenon. Two other sarcophagi (nos. 93a,b) made according to the same design (unmistakably Phoenician-Punic) by the same artist (all three in Greek island marble) were found in situ in tombs in Carthage. The most likely explanation, or at least the simplest, is that the artist responsible for them travelled to Tarquinia and there rendered one more example of a familiar pattern. The gold-foil plaques from the Uni sanctuary at Pyrgi pose many problems aside from those of trade relations, but for this study, they do indicate what was probably a common feature of Punic mercantile set- tlements on foreign soil-involvement in the local cults. Ancient authors (e.g., Plautus) mock the re- ligious fanaticism of the Phoenician and Carthaginian populace, and beneath this mockery is the usual grain of truth. Spanish, Cypriot, and Greek sanctuaries (so far) have produced inscriptional evidence of Phoeni- cian or Punic participation and syncretism in the local dedications. The majority of Etruscan exports occurs in Carthage itself, with other sites involved being Malta, Motya in Sicily, Tharros, and other Punic sites in Sardinia. While many Etruscan bucchero vessels are found in Greek sites and some in Phoenician Cyprus, there are as yet no finds of Etruscan goods in Phoenicia, the Punic homeland. Materials from the Carthaginian trade to Etruria occur in coastal cities only (except for a single coin perhaps dropped in the Punic wars): Populonia, Tarquinia, Cerveteri, and Spina. The Etrus- can pottery imported to Punic sites was probably manufactured in coastal, southern Etruria, in the Etrusco-Corinthian workshops at Tarquinia, the buc- chero centers of Orvieto, Vulci, or Caere, and the Caeretan factory for "Genucilia" ware. The bronzes are not from northern cities, but may have been produced in Vulci,5 with the exception of the focolare attachment (no. 98), which illustrates a type probably made in the region of Chiusi. Historical facts do accommodate the distribution of trade items. All discussion of the Etruscan and Car- thaginian cultures is conveniently limited by the foundation of Carthage around the end of the ninth century B.C.6 and its destruction by Rome in the second century B.C. The autonomy of the Etruscan states had ended also by that time. The Populonia lamp, dating probably to the sev- enth century B.C., is the earliest Punic (as opposed to Phoenician) object in Etruria; Phoenician-manufac- tured and -transported trinkets, metal bowls, etc. are earlier. The gold plaques dedicated at Pyrgi in the beginning of the fifth century clearly indicate Punic involvement with Caere, and the Tarquinia sarcopha- gus and Spina mask suggest some Punic contact for the fourth-third centuries B.C. The earliest Etruscan exports are found in both Carthage (and Utica) and Cadiz, and are the bucchero vessels dating ca. 6oo B.C. Motya, Sicily, also has archaic Etruscan pottery, as do Tharros and other Sardinian sites. Only Carthage and Malta, its nearest non-African colony, received manufactured goods in the fifth through third centuries B.C. The first treaty between Carthage and Rome, re- corded by Polybius,7 very likely reflects the type of agreement negotiated by the Punic empire and any alien states. In this case, the treaty clearly favors Car- thaginian mercantile interests (a Punic monopoly of Sardinia, Sicily, North Africa, and points west), for Rome must have had little to offer, or to lose, around 509/508 B.C. Etruscan goods in Cadiz, however, are not surprising, since that city, like Utica, had been founded long before Carthage and was probably still autonomous. Some Etruscan cities must have been sending trade goods throughout the Mediterranean by the sixth century B.C. Etruscan trading with Motya may have been possible for the same reasons as for Cadiz, or because, like Sardinia, there was no ques- tion of its markets being closed to Etruscans, who had always dealt with the natives there. Each Etruscan mercantile state would have independently negotiated its own treaty, and each was probably important enough economically to merit better considerations than Rome. Why should there have been treaties at all, if the only items of commerce were luxury goods, pottery, and small manufactured bronzes? What would have induced Punic merchants in Sardinia and Carthage to purchase very shabby Etrusco-Corinthian pottery at the same time that they were receiving genuine Corin- thian? I suggest that all of the items catalogued here are only part of the extra cargoes of ships carrying 4See R. Bloch, "R'marques sur un masque ibero-punique d6couvert h Spina," Arte antica e moderna 17 (1962) 54- 57, fig. IIa; and C.G. Picard, Karthago 13 (1967) 38-39. 50On possible origins and wide European distribution, see B. Bouloumie, "Les oinocho6s en bronze du type Schnabel- kanne en France et en Belgique," Gallia 31 (1973) 1-17. 6 The foundation dates for Carthage have long been dis- puted, but exact chronology is not so necessary in this case. The most recent thorough survey is that of Cintas, Manuel de l'archdologie punique I (1970) 3-242, 382ff. See also Cintas, "La cdramique de Motye et la date de la fondation de Car- thage," BAC 1963-1964, I07ff. 7 Polybius 3.22.4-13. The dating of the treaty depends upon the absolute date for the establishment of the Roman Re- public and is controversial. It seems that the acknowledged antiquity of the first treaty and the primitive state of Car- thaginian geography described in it really ought to denote the 510/509/508 B.C. traditional date. Among many discus- sions, some of the more recent are A. Toynbee, Hannibal's Legacy I (1961) 519-34, esp. 523; R.E. Mitchell, Historia 20 (1971) 633-55; and Et. Colozier, MEFR 65 (1953) 92.</page><page sequence="7">374 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 81 much more necessary commodities of foodstuffs, or, more likely, metals, which have not been preserved in their original form. Punic prospecting and control of metal resources in the western Mediterranean and Atlantic are well known, as is the Etruscan possession of iron and copper resources (one recalls the Etruscan bronze industries famous in antiquity). Possibly, the Carthaginians supplied something, perhaps tin, to Etruscan cities in return for some other raw material, and the manufactured goods were transported along with this trade. No metal ingots of the Archaic period have been found anywhere yet, although an archaic wreck off Cap d'Antibes, France,8 has provided evidence of some sort of joint Etruscan-Punic venture, since it con- tained Etruscan amphorae and bucchero pottery as well as a Punic lamp. In the future it is likely that underwater finds of shipwrecks and better identifica- tion of Etruscan and Punic objects in all sites will greatly augment this picture. Certainly the work in progress at Carthage will have bearing on the foreign relations of these two cultures which are emerging only now from relative obscurity. As it seems at present (and the synthesis here sug- gested represents only a general consideration of some of the evidence), Carthage and some Etruscan coastal cities (such as Caere) were generally allied by com- mercial agreements, since each could supply certain necessary commodities without jeopardizing the oth- er's provincial markets. In 535 B.C. Carthage and Caere (at least) united voluntarily to drive out Greek competition for the Tyrrhenian Sea; in the early fifth century there was an important trading post on Caere- tan soil (Pyrgi-Punicum). However, Etruscans seem not to have been at Himera or Motya to help their allies against the Sicilian Greeks, nor did a Carthagini- an navy arrive at Cumae (474 B.C.) in time to support the Etruscan fleet against Hieron and the Western Greeks. In the mercenary wars of the fifth and fourth centuries, the nationality of the participants had little correlation with any previous alliances. Later, during the "Punic" Wars, the Etruscan cities gave relatively little support to either side but occasionally rebelled against their Roman garrisons when Hannibal was nearby and might conceivably profit from and reward their efforts. In general, however, these ancient states did not react with the idealism or consistency at- tributed to modern politics, and they appear to have honored treaties militarily only when they were mu- tually profitable. Their trade relations, much less com- plex than modern economical systems, presumably existed and flourished only in situations that offered both parties benefits with no compromises.
