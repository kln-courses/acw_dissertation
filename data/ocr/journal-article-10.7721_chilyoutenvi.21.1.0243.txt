Abstract  This paper describes a series of experimental play-based activities called “Narrative  Journeys” piloted by the author in his work at the Eden Project, UK, which are used  to practically, imaginatively and socially connect children to the natural world, and  thus encourage place-based learning and cultivate ecological literacy. It argues that  anthropomorphic narratives, despite their seemingly human-centric values, can  actually help combat the development of anthropocentric attitudes, by the careful  framing of objects, collaborative and social action, and with the support of an  environmentally sensitive facilitator.

Nature, Narrative and Children’s Anthropocentric... 244  Once upon a Time...  Within transformative ideologies such as deep ecology, ecofeminism and social  ecology, there is considerable pressure to move away from an anthropocentric  perspective on nature, and instead adopt a more bio- or ecocentric viewpoint  (Corbett 2006). While this paper generally supports this movement, there is  evidence to suggest that some activities can actually enhance a child’s  understanding and eventual attachments with nature despite being framed within  human-centric values. Moreover, this work suggests that careful selection and  usage of anthropomorphic narratives can enable children to begin emotional  journeys with nature, which, when continually fostered, plant the seeds for further  experiences and learning that condition more eco-centric attitudes and values in the  future.     This paper describes a narrative-based approach used to encourage children’s  access to, and influence their experiences of, nature. It specifically focuses on a set  of playful methodologies that fall within the broad theme of “Narrative Journeys,”  developed by the author over the past three years at the Eden project,1 UK.  Although the descriptions here are based on practiced examples, references to  research in the areas of affordances, experiential participation and ecological  literacy will be made throughout.    Into the Woods  “Trees talk,” I say with conviction, my eyes darting from one tree to another  before turning back to the children. “Seriously, they talk.”   “I can’t hear anything...” Scott defies.  “Me neither...” Clarissa confirms.  “Of course you can’t,” I begin. “You’ve got to be a member of the Guild of  Talking Trees to be able to talk tree language, everybody knows that!”   A few of them giggle, and then Clarissa starts. “You’re silly.”  “Um, yes.” I nod. “And I think the trees would agree with you. Look, they’re  laughing also!”  Tom points to a young pine. “That one’s laughing, look! It’s moving.” All the  children gasp, as the tree gently sways in the wind.    Children are remarkably perceptive to stories and narratives that draw them into a  world of make-believe; it is as if they are naturally tuned to perceive the world as  playful, and that play itself is a way of being. Narrative Journeys are subtle nature- based introductions that invite children to experience the natural world through a  narrative lens. By drawing on their innate drive to be playful, a narrative journey  supports the intersection between child and place. From a narrative standpoint, all  environments are playable; they are landscapes imbued with a play language,  whereby children are the primary readers of that language.                                                       1 Eden is an educational garden and environmental charity created in an exhausted quarry  in the china clay mining area of Cornwall, UK.

Nature, Narrative and Children’s Anthropocentric... 245  Narrative journeys normally begin with a story walk, a process by which children  are presented subtle, yet coercive narrative invites that entice them into a storied  landscape. The facilitator’s role during a story walk is not to create an entire epic  from beginning to end, but to simply offer invites and then observe where children  go with those invites. For example, a story walk carried out at Cotehele estate,  Cornwall, used an impromptu invite based on the discovery of the skeletal remains  of a leaf. The leaf afforded the author an opportunity to suggest it was the remains  of a fairy’s wing, which then prompted an hour-long venture looking for fairies and  their hideouts (Figure 1).    Figure 1.  Looking for fairies        Anthropomorphic references to nature are nothing new; film, animation, television,  literature and advertising have all featured narrative discourses where nature is  centered in the human condition, where many of the protagonists in these stories  are neither human, nor alive. Disney’s Mickey Mouse, and Tolkien’s tree guardians,  the Ent, in The Lord of the Rings are good examples. The purpose of  anthropomorphism within story walking is twofold. First, children naturally play  their experiences through inanimate objects as a way of safely testing out ideas on  the world. For example, children as young as 2 years are able to ascribe passive  agency to dolls and toy animals, before soon learning to attribute active agency,  and even independent agency, whereby dolls and replica objects carry out their  own make-believe actions (Kavanaugh and Harris 1999). Secondly, by making  comparisons between humans and artifacts of nature, children begin to see artifacts  in nature as moral objects (Gebhard, Nevers and Billmann-Mahecha 2003), which  </page> <page sequence="4"> Trees Talk: Are You Listening? Nature, Narrative and Children’s Anthropocentric... 246  could be the beginning of empathic attachments to the natural world and an early  form of ecological literacy.2      Seeing the Wood for the Trees  A story walk is about a journey through a landscape, and it involves both physical  and narrative motion. The facilitator’s role is one of sensitivity, as for the most part  children will be operating within a field of free action (Chawla 2007); that is,  playing freely within the frame of the narrative. But motion itself is a complicated  physio-conceptual process. For instance, children, when asked to put life-based  organisms in an order of “more alive,” regularly put humans at the top, followed by  animals, then plants, and then other life forms, and they do so based on an  organism’s ability to mobilize itself. It is believed that this form of rationale is an  early indicator of anthropocentrism (Yorek, Şahin and Aydun 2009). A story walk,  therefore, requires regular injection of narrative cues to sensitively address these  kinds of biases, so by introducing scientific knowledge about the mobility of other  living organisms an appreciation for other life forms can begin to develop.      “Hey, Clarissa,” I call. “Look at this.”   “I’ve seen one of those before,” she says excitedly. “They spin really fast  when you throw them in the air.” She tosses the seed into the air and we  watch it fall propeller-style to the ground.  “Did you know that fairies, when they shed their first set of wings, travel  through the air hanging onto maple seeds?”   “How do they stop without getting hurt?” she asks curiously.  “Ah, well, every fairy knows only to jump on a seed that has the right leaf  span-to-weight ratio. Clever, huh?”   “Can I keep this one?”   I point to the maple tree. “You’d best ask Aunt Maple.”  Clarissa scrambles off through the dense foliage and starts conversing with a  maple tree.    The Apple Bears the Seed of an Orchard Yet to Be  Occasionally, as in the fairy example above, a story walk will fluctuate between a  field of free action and a field of promoted action, with the latter being more of a  prompted walk framed by the facilitator than the freely narrated experiences of  children. A really good story walk, however, takes all the players along the same  journey at the same time. It enables group connectivity through a common theme  where individual differences can be maintained by adopting characterized roles.  Consequently, a good starting place for children’s nature experiences is a  “collaborative story walk,” where collective actions help co-create and drive a  narrative.                                                      2 Ecological Literacy is the term used to describe our ability to understand how natural  systems function, what part we play in these systems, and how these systems make life on  earth possible.  </page> <page sequence="5"> Trees Talk: Are You Listening? Nature, Narrative and Children’s Anthropocentric... 247  A collaborative story walk relies on children creating characters in advance of the  story, which thus frames the story to be accommodating and inclusive of everyone’s  needs. Framing normally begins with children creating a character name; a  combination of their own name and the name of a natural object. Thus, the author’s  combined name of Philip, with the tree name, Willow, bears a whole new character  name: Phillow. The second framing technique involves children assigning  themselves a characteristic that defines them, thus Phillow may become “Phillow  the Wise.” Characteristics like wisdom, for example, give children material to use  during the co-creation of their stories: a wise character can be mentor, adjudicator  and all-knowing, giving that person a lot of story credential. Thirdly, children are  asked to adopt a power that is informed by nature, be it animal, plant, or element.  Thus, “Phillow the Wise” may be able to converse in different ways with different  tree species. Engineered carefully, those relationships could be informed by the  trees themselves—for example, their characteristics, affordances, seasonal  differences, shape, color or size—and thus begin to root children’s narrative  experiences within an ecological context. Finally, a collaborative story walk has to  enable children to enter a partly fabricated world, so it is important to establish a  portal to be crossed, a threshold into a magical place. Physical props like gate  posts, holes in hedges or overhanging branches all make appealing entrances.  However, the crossover is more about belief than physical properties; it is about  being comfortable walking the fuzzy boundary between physical reality and  imagined reality, or what could be called the narrated third space.     The general idea of a collaborative story walk is that you are a player in a story that  you create as you go along, rather than a story maker who talks about a story yet  to be created. Thus, it is the difference between saying: “Here’s a leaf; we could  pretend it’s a fairy’s wing,” which is a story yet to be told, versus: “Look at this! A  fairy has lost its wing and might be in trouble,” which is a story under construction,  in the moment, in the here and now. Narrative rules like this can be tricky for  children to understand. If you tell them to start “acting” a story, then chances are  they may become self-conscious and start withdrawing from the activity. The  facilitator’s role, then, is to be in the narrated third space with the children while  remaining conscious they are only there to grant permissions, place narrative cues  and sustain the story cycle: “Seriously, this is a fairy’s wing!”     The creation of names and characters within a story is more than simply the  fostering of child/landscape attachments; the very essence of a story walk is  collaboration. A story walk, although often framed by an adult, is designed to be  participant-led. The facilitator has to know when to intervene and when to  withdraw, and recognize when a narrative cue is needed and when it is not.  Creating the narrative third space is not easy, and it doesn’t come with a  guidebook, but this approach is necessary for children to form attachments to the  natural world under their own self-guided interests.    Don’t Just Hug a Tree, Climb It!  Research suggests that some people mainly anthropomorphize to satisfy  “effectance motivation,” that is, to satisfy the basic and persistent drive to attain  mastery over one’s environment (Waytz et al. 2010). In short, anthropomorphism  </page> <page sequence="6"> Trees Talk: Are You Listening? Nature, Narrative and Children’s Anthropocentric... 248  softens the interface between children and raw nature by making it more appealing  and inviting. On the other hand it is also proposed that some environments put  pressure on children to act in ways that are consistent with the apparent character  of the environment; these environments are called “behavior settings” (Heft 1988).  Both these viewpoints tell us that children feel an urge to act on the environment to  satisfy internal needs, while the environment itself sends messages to children to  act on it in particular ways. This embodied way of connecting to the environment  can be both enhanced and depressed through narrative cues and diversions. For  example, a large but vulnerable tree with low-lying branches that invite children to  climb could be framed as “old,” “frail” or even “sickly,” while a healthy, resilient  tree could be framed as being “desperate for a hug.” Narrative descriptors like  these support research that show children display a preference for the action-based  properties of objects rather than physical properties (Ye, Cardwell and Mark 2009).  That is, objects with action potential—a “climbable” or “huggable” tree, for  example, are a more functional invitation than a tree described as “coniferous and  50 feet high.”     The downside of using only anthropomorphic activities is that some forms of  scientific knowledge, such as biology, have been diluted so much that children are  no longer retaining accuracy in the knowledge (Byrne, Grace and Hanley 2010.  Furthermore, it is suggested that while anthropomorphism as a metaphor to  transmit young people’s scientific ideas is useful, it should be used as a compliment  to scientific data rather than a replacement for it. Collaborative story walks,  however, can support both possibilities: the tree doesn’t just have to be huggable;  it can be 50 feet tall, coniferous, and huggable!    From Small Acorns  Natural environments provide a range of artifacts and materials with which children  can play with during their narrative journeys, which to some degree socializes the  landscape by helping children create meaning in it. Children develop a vocabulary  of object usage as a result of their continued interactions with objects, which is a  far cry from adults who, according to Deák (2006), suffer a “functional fixedness” in  perceiving other affordances for objects beyond their designated usage. That is, to  most adults a leaf is just a leaf, nothing more, nothing less. It is important,  therefore, to deliver narrative journey workshops to adults as well as children,  paying particular attention to object usage, functional fixedness and affordances,  and leading them through a collaborative story to reframe adulterated and  socialized beliefs about objects used in narrative contexts.    Objects in narrative journeys are more than just loose materials, more than pebbles  and sticks or leaves and mud. In narrative journeys, objects encompass any  physical property within an environment, including people, animals, trees, fields,  caves, rocks, water and buildings. For example, in South Brent, a small Devon  village in the UK, an 80-foot tunnel that diverts water under a railway line (Figure  2) was used in a narrative journey for families. The tunnel was given the name “the  Dribbling Mouth,” and went on to become the highlighted experience of the day.  Similarly, in the clay areas around Eden, there are two spoil heaps that because of  their physical appearance are aptly named Flatty and Pointy. The personalization of  </page> <page sequence="7"> Trees Talk: Are You Listening? Nature, Narrative and Children’s Anthropocentric... 249  landscape markers, therefore, not only helps children to develop mental maps of  the area in which they live, it sets up a relationship between themselves and the  landscape, which can be passed from one generation to another. For instance, in  the Isles of Scilly (an archipelago just off the Cornish coast), many generations of  families have called the coastal vegetation that sweeps the cliff tops the “Icing,” as  it resembles the icing on a cake. Objects like the Icing, Flatty and Pointy, and the  Dribbling Mouth can be used in narrative journeys to deepen the attachments  children have with those spaces; eventually they become embedded in local,  cultural and natural history stories.    Figure 2. The Dribbling Mouth          Once upon a Time Revisited    Clarissa and Tom appear from behind a clump of ferns each carrying a  handful of dead leaves.   “Look!” Clarissa begins. “There must be lots of fairies living here.”  “Maybe they’re dead.” Tom suggests quite innocently.  “Actually,” I begin, as Clarissa elbows Tom in the ribs. “I have heard of an  old legend about fairies being in a great battle. I think it was called the battle  of Fern Valley.” I pretend to be deep in thought.  “Did all the fairies die?” Clarissa asks with some concern.  </page> <page sequence="8"> Trees Talk: Are You Listening? Nature, Narrative and Children’s Anthropocentric... 250  “I don’t think so...” I begin.  “I bet they were taken by trolls.” Tom points deep into the woods.  “I believe it happened somewhere near the tallest pine tree in the forest,” I  say, scratching my head for effect.  “Shall we rescue them?” Clarissa asks, while grabbing Tom by the arm.  “Okay.” I say, and they both drop the leaves and run off through the ferns.    A narrative journey is an experimental approach that uses story walks for  supporting children’s ability to connect and build attachments with the natural  world. A narrative journey can be a straightforward story walk involving a facilitator  who offers invites to children, who then go off and play out the story as they  venture through a landscape. The invites used by the facilitator are often prompted  by artifacts or objects, or even the affordances of an entire space, which then set  the tone, value, subject and content for the story. In collaborative story walks the  emphasis is on the co-creation of narrative journeys between many individuals who  share the story as a social creation. Collaborative story walks are framed using  characterization tools and objects, and like the basic story walk, may involve the  drip-feeding of narrative prompts to either focus attention on learning outcomes,  place attachments, or to maintain the story cycle.     While a narrative journey can help address deep-seated anthropocentric values, it  does not shy away from using tools that have an anthropomorphic resonance; in  fact, as the research has suggested, careful, sensitive and measured use of  anthropomorphic tools can support the learning of scientific ideas, as well as forge a  value base centered in moral and emotional connections to nature. Furthermore,  there is plenty of community-based evidence to suggest that cultural and natural  history stories, folk and fairy tales, and local mythologies are acted out by children  when they play. Oddly enough, the deep ecology, ecofeminism and social ecology  movements have always pointed towards indigenous people as good examples of  ecologically minded communities—the very same indigenous groups whose histories  and cultural practices are steeped in narrative traditions. Narrative journeys,  therefore, have always been used as tools for connecting people to the natural  world and will continue to do so.      “What did you do yesterday, Clarissa?” A teacher asks.     Beaming, Clarissa begins: “Well, I chatted with a pine tree, helped Tom carry   hundreds of fairy wings, hid among some ferns, which we were told could   make us invisible if we found their flowers. Then we went looking for the   tallest tree ever, which is about 115m high, but it’s not really in this country.   Then we rescued hundreds of fairies from the trolls; I was bitten by one   disguised as a plant, but Tom said it was a bramble. We then climbed an   oak tree, which was very old, and groaned a bit if we got too high, so we   came back down. Then we waded through a swamp—it had loads of troll   bones in it, although Scott said it was bits of dead tree. And then we had to   roll down a steep bank without crushing the daisies, because they squeal in a   high pitch when you sit on them. And then after playing in the woods I went   to granny’s house for tea, came home and went to bed.”         </page> <page sequence="9"> Trees Talk: Are You Listening?

As well as writing, making films and carrying out research, Phil  coordinates programs of work at the Eden Project about connecting children to  nature through play. He believes that both “play” and “nature” are two ecological  contexts that help sustain healthy human beings, and that to be living in a society  where both have been eroded from many children’s lived experiences is both  shocking and worrying. His work and life is about addressing this issue.      References    Byrne, J., M. Grace, and P.
