These volumes present the results of excavations un- dertaken at the Middle Bronze Age site of I Faraglioni on the island of Ustica, 57 km north of Palermo in west- ern Sicily. Ustica, in contrast to the Aeolian islands, has only become widely known to archaeologists in recent years. These are the first excavations to be published in monograph form, although four earlier campaigns were conducted at I Faraglioni between 1974 and 1980 by G. Mannino.1 This is an important site for the western Med- iterranean Bronze Age: a large, well-preserved settlement, characterized by courtyard dwellings with rich ceramic assemblages, delimited by trackways and, more surpris- ingly, a monumental wall with semicircular turrets. A vis- itor center has been constructed and the site has been designated an archaeological park. In the first volume, Holloway gives a succinct account of the 1990-1991 excavations, proposing four periods of building and occupation. Period 1 has scattered apsidal buildings and a sanctuary; period 2 witnessed major archi- tectural development (defensive walls and courtyard hous- es); period 3 was relatively short-lived, with only partial reconstruction, although defenses were strengthened; period 4 was more ephemeral, with floor levels in a few places. The reader will notice, however, that the distinc- tion between periods and the assignment of different contexts to the same period is not always self-evident and complicated in places by nonjoining structures and by the similarity of the pottery in all phases. One or two trenches lack buildings, implying that cer- tain areas within the perimeter wall may have been open spaces. Also significant is the suggestion of metalwork- ing in area 3 and of a cult area in courtyard 4, where two stone features are reconstructed with considerable license as an altar base and a plinth for the controversial "statue" (below), which consists of two stone fragments carved in an anthropomorphic form. This find, however, was not directly associated with its putative plinth, but had been reused as masonry in a later wall. Holloway regards a near- by deposit (room 5) resembling a stone fill as sacrificial in nature (a "bothros"), although the animal bones re- semble those from other contexts. Short descriptions, plans, and photographs of buildings provide basic infor- mation about household fixtures, which include large grindstones and round terracotta slabs. Ceramic finds (storage and cooking wares, pedestal vas- es, stands, spindle whorls, clay horns, counters, and net- sinkers) are discussed and quantified by Lukesh, who also considers the practical uses of vessels and their spatial and temporal distributions. A solitary Mycenaean (LH IIIB-C) sherd from topsoil and stratified sherds with in- cised decoration in Apennine style denote long-distance contacts, for which the evidence is otherwise sparse. Evi- dently Ustica lay beyond the busier sphere of maritime interaction around the Aeolian islands. Tykot has sourced 11 pieces of obsidian from an unspecified surface location outside the site to Lipari and one piece to Pantelleria, which he takes as evidence of "Late" (he surely means Middle) Bronze Age trade. However, he does not consid- er the possibility that this merely represents procurement or recycling of residual material from earlier prehistoric sites on Ustica (where obsidian has been found); it is surprising that no flint or obsidian blades come from strat- ified levels. Useful chapters follow on domestic architec- ture (Doonan) and the imposing landward wall (Gifford), which underwent several modifications. Shorter contri- butions deal with a so-called necropolis (Holloway), the sculpture (Holloway), and faunal remains (Cruz-Uribe). A welcome list of radiocarbon dates is supplied, but with minimal comment. Holloway states (5) that they support the traditional chronology. While six of the eight samples (the material is unspecified) come from the same 1Mannino 1980-1982. 103 American Journal of Archaeology 108 (2004) 103-6</page><page sequence="2">104 ROBERT LEIGHTON [AJA108 room, however, none was taken from phase 4 contexts and there is only one for phase 1 (1949-1778 cal. B.C. lo), which is much earlier than the traditional dating would suggest. The calibrated ranges of four dates fall substantially within the expected chronology for the Si- cilian Middle Bronze Age (dated by Mycenaean pottery imports to the 14th-13th centuries B.C.). Three others are slightly later (13th-llth centuries B.C.) and out of sequence with the proposed phasing, as two samples from phase 2 levels are later than those from phase 3. This is not a cause for undue concern, since phases are thought to follow in quick succession. However, it would have been more accurate to say that while 14C dating partially coincides with a traditional chronology, some date rang- es are outside the expected time band and the late dates raise the possibility of a longer occupation than conven- tional dating would suggest. The second volume includes more reconstruction draw- ings, which are helpful visual aids, although they exag- gerate the sizes of walls and turrets (fig. 1.3-5). Period 2 is subdivided, using arguments that are not always easy to follow. Holloway regards the phase 2B settlement as a fortified citadel with only four houses, but this could be a serious underestimate, because less than a quarter of the site has been excavated. He also envisages a population consisting of a despotic "pirate king" and a small band of henchmen, likened to "wreckers who lit false lights on the pinnacles to lure unwary mariners to their doom" (8). This imaginative scenario, presented in a somewhat rhetorical style, is followed by a description of new find- ings: defensive seaward walls, a well, street, and several rooms, one of which suggests "a gathering place where drinking was a prominent activity" (19). Lukesh provides an illuminating account of potential activity areas based on pottery combinations. A discussion follows under the improbable heading of "Ustica and the Mycenaeans," which struggles to place this supposed pirates' nest in a remote island fortress within the broader context of international relations. Holloway admits that Ustica seems far removed from the main maritime routes along the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy. Surely, then, a little honest agriculture, stock rearing, and fishing would have provided a much more reliable livelihood for its inhabitants, whom he has branded "free- booters and brigands" (12). Finally, we return to a con- sideration of cults and the sculpture, in which it is stated that "the sculptor was clearly aware of Aegean represen- tational art and adapted it into a Sicilian tradition" (78) . From a technical standpoint these volumes are pass- able, and the standard of photographic documentation is good, although the plans are often small-scale and not very detailed, the section drawings few and schematic, and the descriptions of some contexts, especially house interiors, rather brief. More plans showing the rich ce- ramic assemblages in situ and numbered contexts would have been helpful, as well as a finds catalogue with line drawings, at least of the metal artifacts, molds, and the Mycenaean sherd. It is not clear whether flotation or sieving was attempted; thus information about the envi- ronment, natural vegetation, or crops is lacking. Further work could usefully illuminate the nature of the potters' clay: is it local or imported? New excavations have recently commenced at I Fara- glioni under the direction of the Palermo Superinten- dency. These volumes (and Mannino's excavations, which ought to be properly published) will obviously provide the basis for future work, although they raise several questions that need to be answered. First, the authenticity of the sculpture has been the subject of acrimonious exchanges between Mannino and Hollo- way since 1993, when an anonymous letter was sent to Mannino, the Mayor of Ustica, and the journal Sicilia Archeologica, declaring the object to be a fake, planted on the site as a practical joke.2 Photographs purporting to show the sculpture in the course of manufacture were also received. Nevertheless, the latest rebuttal by Hol- loway and Lukesh offers some credible arguments in favor of accepting it as genuine; notably, the observa- tion that the existing finished artifact seems wider in one place than the "fake" in preparation, judging by the available photographs.3 One certainly sympathizes with the excavators, who have either been the victims of a prank or of a more malicious attempt to discredit them and deprive everyone of a re- markable find, unique for the Italian Bronze Age. I am indeed suspicious of the claim in the anonymous letter that this "scherzo" was only intended to confuse the archae- ologists "per qualche minuto"4 Ten years have passed, and the controversy is still unresolved. Moreover, the fact that the fraudsters have never identified themselves gives cre- dence to the idea that the real hoax is not the sculpture. Not surprisingly, however, most scholars, including this reviewer (much to the irritation of Holloway and Lukesh) have been reluctant to enter the fray, unable to reach a firm conclusion on the basis of the available informa- tion.5 To most of us this beguiling object is known only from photographs, having been removed from display on Ustica and locked away in the Palermo museum many years ago. The Sicilian archaeological authorities have yet to express an opinion on the matter. Yet, ultimately, it will be up to the staff of the Archaeological Superin- tendence who are best placed to assess all the evidence, to decide whether there are sufficient grounds to justify the sculpture's rehabilitation. If they decide to put it back on display as a genuine find, perhaps following fur- ther examination (of the stone and the photographs), public confidence could be restored. Divergent views have also been expressed about the original extent of the site. Mannino suggested that it originally stretched to an offshore rock pinnacle (the "colombaro" dovecote), where contemporary surface finds have been recovered, and that there could have been up to 300 dwellings.6 This figure is hard to believe, however, even assuming a solid spread of buildings, an idea under- 2 Holloway 1997; Mannino 1997b. 3 Holloway and Lukesh 2002. 4 Mannino 1997b, 19. 5 My original reporting of the putative hoax (Leighton 1999, 280 n. 11) was based on information from the Archaeological Superintendency in Palermo, not exactly "hearsay" (Holloway and Lukesh 2002, 976) . 6 Mannino 1980-1982,280.</page><page sequence="3">2004] FORTRESS USTICA? AN ISLAND WORLD IN THE BRONZE AGE 105 mined by recent excavations. It would also make the site far bigger than its contemporaries (though none has been fully excavated in Sicily). Nevertheless, one can see evi- dence of coastal erosion at several places, closely resem- bling the situation at the Middle Bronze Age clifftop settlement on Panarea, where parts of dwellings have fallen into the sea. Wave action around these islands can create spectacular sea arches, prone to eventual collapse; an example at I Faraglioni is illustrated on the cover of the second volume. The possibility of a narrow promon- tory extending toward the pinnacle should perhaps not be dismissed altogether. One would like to know the opin- ion of geologists on this matter. By contrast, Holloway and Lukesh do not admit of much erosion at all. They believe that the rock pinnacle was always separate, and a potential lighthouse. But what prac- tical advantage would it offer, lying close to a little-fre- quented shore at about the same elevation as the adja- cent coastline? The controversy, however, hinges mainly on the existence of seaward defenses, which Holloway identifies as a tract of thick walling with a narrow pas- sageway, subsequently replaced by a long terrace wall. Unexcavated houses lie beneath. Yet, according to Man- nino, the terrace wall is a construction of the Bourbon period, delimiting property from the coastal pathway.7 This part of the site, scarcely excavated so far, would re- pay further investigation. One would also like to know how much stonework at the back of the landward wall was added during the 1970s (1:69). The supposed cist tombs near the cliff edge, where no human remains or artifacts have ever been found, are even more perplexing. Here too a counterclaim exists: that these are natural volcanic formations, also encountered else- where on Ustica.8 Again, one would like to hear a qualified opinion on the subject of the local rock formations. Hollo- way's idea of a very small population (1:10) rests partly on the small number of these features. He asserts that the sizes of these cavities "show that the tomb-makers were working with standardized dimensions" (1:77). Holloway assumes that the site enclosed a "regia" (a potentially misleading term) and suggests that one house excavated by Mannino belonged to a ruler, but the evi- dence for this is flimsy: the relevant finds are unpub- lished and the structure is not markedly different from other buildings in size (about 6 m diameter) and design. On the subject of different activity areas and potential cult rooms, Lukesh is more circumspect, noting that each had a "distinct function which we cannot immediately tease out based on ceramic material alone" (2:41). Hollo- way is also confident that the site was destroyed by invad- ers at the end of period 3, and probably of period 2, although there is no overall cultural change between one phase and the next. Rooms 12 and 14 have evidence of burning, but one cannot be sure of the cause. Just because stones were dumped in a pithos does not neces- sarily mean that the room was deliberately set alight, as Lukesh claims (2:47). Mannino, for example, admitted the possibility of destruction by outsiders or of a final voluntary abandonment of the site, without coming to any firm conclusion.9 One characteristic of Holloway's generally bold inter- pretation is the recurrent assertion of Aegean parallels for a number of the site's features, which is not always convincing. For example, a stretch of masonry support- ing a walkway is baldly stated to be "based on Minoan- Mycenaean highway engineering" (2:74), while the over- all conception of the site's internal relationships and its social structure is likened to Mycenae and Tiryns. Like- wise, arguably too much is made of three flat stones, found near the terrace wall, said to imply "the stimulus of travelers who have seen cities and fortresses with dressed stone work and desired some of the same" (2:29). Yet more obvious correspondences closer to hand elicit little comment: for example, in the Aeolian islands (at least Doonan focuses attention here) and on Pantelleria. One would assume that the islanders' main contacts were with northwestern Sicily, although the Bronze Age in this area is not well known. Preoccupied with Aegean connections, however, Holloway misses the point, in my opinion: that what is often most striking about western Mediterranean islands, especially those left to their own devices, is their capacity to surprise us with original creations and adapta- tions by their inhabitants.10 For its remarkably integrat- ed approach to urban planning, this site is rather more impressive than its contemporaries on the Aeolian is- lands, despite their closer links with the outside world. The authors refer to the site as a "fortress," "castle," or "citadel."11 These terms have variable connotations, but generally imply a rather specialized design and function, for which the evidence here is only partial. Admittedly, the perimeter walls look defensive, and it is as well to remember that this period on the Aeolian islands seems to have ended with an invasion from the Italian peninsu- la, marking the start of the Ausonian period on Lipari. On Ustica, we lack evidence for a comparable phase of Late Bronze Age occupation, but Holloway is right to remind us that maritime interrelations were not neces- sarily pacific. On the other hand, the internal dynamics of life on Ustica deserve more consideration, and one should note that the site is conspicuously located next to a stretch of flat arable land. Although it is a small island (8.6 km2), there were probably other contemporary set- tlements, as suggested by surface finds.12 The modern town, which is beside the Hellenistic and Roman center of Ustica on the Falconiera rock, occupies a much more commanding and sheltered position overlooking a good anchorage. The Faraglioni perimeter wall might have had additional functions, aimed at impressing neighboring groups and visitors, and perhaps providing shelter from the predominant westerly and northerly winds. In conclusion, however, apart from the regrettable controversy over the sculpture, it is not surprising to find that a complex and challenging site can give rise to op- posing interpretations. More problem-oriented research could clarify several issues, and much could also be learned from other prehistoric sites on Ustica.
