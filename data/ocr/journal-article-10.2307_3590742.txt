The past steps into the background, of course, but it never seems to disappear ..." (Elizabeth Goudge, A City of Bells) ABSTRACT Although in philosophical dictionaries and the like, Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947) is often praised as one of the most original thinkers of the twentieth century, his work has been virtually ignored. The articles and books that are concerned with Whitehead's phi- losophy, with the exception of the work of Dale H. Porter, hardly ever mention the rele- vance that it has for the philosophy of history and for historiography. I intend to demon- strate this relevance in this article. For this purpose, I will explore three themes: 1) the self- evidence of certain kinds of forgetting by historians; 2) the fallacy of the view that the occurrence of these kinds of forgetting in historiography must necessarily lead to truth-rel- ativism; and 3) continuity in history, which persists even when certain ruptures occur. My treatment of these themes will in part be a response to Frank Ankersmit, who took up some of them from a different perspective in the October issue of History and Theory in 2001.1 I. INTRODUCTION Some time ago, Antoon van den Braembussche published an article about histo- ry and memory in which he pointed out that historical truth embodies a constant dialectical play between the remembering and the forgetting of the past.2 More recently, in History and Theory, Frank Ankersmit drew attention to the fact that the element of forgetting in history has often been forgotten by historians and philosophers of history alike. This is true. Van den Braembussche is an excep- tion. Both authors justifiably emphasize the element of forgetting in history and historiography, but at the same time, what they point out need not surprise us. Drawing from the work of Alfred North Whitehead, I will argue that the expla- nation for our forgetting of the past lies in the way our consciousness functions. Our perception of the past, although more indirect, is not fundamentally differ- ent from our perception of the present. In both cases a selection is made, which means that some elements in our perception will feature more prominently, and 1.

This idea will be explored in part III of this article. An important question is how this relates to the notion of truth in history-a notion that has become increasingly problematic due to the influence of post- modernism in the philosophy of history. If every historian is necessarily selec- tive, does that not imply that any account of what happened in the past is a mere subjective opinion, and that therefore in historiography claims to truth are always invalid? In my view, it does not. From Whitehead's conception of the relation between subject and object it follows that there can be no such thing as purely subjective perception. It will also become clear that statements, or, rather, whole texts about some part of the past can be true in many ways and in varying degrees. Part IV is concerned with this problematic. One of the reasons some philosophers have such problems with the notion of truth in history is that the past is seen as completely different from the present. It is as if there is an unbridgeable gap between now and then. Whitehead's philos- ophy, which is a form of "process philosophy," suggests that there is a much greater continuity in history. Even after a great event, a "revolution," there is still much more of the old in the new than we are sometimes inclined to think. This is the subject of part V of the article. Before diving into the problematics sketched above, I will give in part II a brief presentation of some basic elements in Whitehead's thought for those read- ers who are not familiar with his ideas. This presentation will suggest several points of relevance of Whitehead's thought for historical theory and practice that will be elaborated on in subsequent sections. Whitehead's process philosophy provides an alternative for the worldview that has dominated Western thought for the past centuries, and that underlies the postmodern rejection of the notion of truth in the science of history. Central to this dominant worldview are the ideas that the world is divided into perceiving subjects (human beings) and static, per- ceived objects, and that the present is separated from the altogether different past. Whitehead rejects the division between subject and object, but uses the distinc- tion primarily to denote two sides of the experiential units called events, or actu- al occasions (among other things), that form the basic elements of the process of reality. He stresses the continuity between past and present, and subjects and the world; in general, he stresses the relatedness of events both synchronically and diachronically. In doing so, he affirms the validity of the historian's search for truth, and underscores the historical dimension of reality. With his article "History as Process," Dale Porter also drew attention to the rel- evance of Whitehead's thought for historical theory and historiography.3 Whereas his focus was on the notion of causality and its process-philosophical alternative or variant, I will primarily be concerned with the perception in history and the possibility of knowing the past. Therefore, I will attend more to the philosophi- cal foundations underlying (and validating) the work of historians than to the 3. Dale H.

The last section of this article, however, will give an example, through a process critique of Ankersmit, of the kind of writing about history that is to be avoided. Although the primary purpose of this article is to counter the relativistic implications of a nowadays popular philosophy of history, these are implications for historiography.4 Furthermore, the essay provides important general insights into the nature of (historical) reality--I could also say: the historical nature of reality-that should be kept in mind by anyone writing about history. II. SOME FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS IN WHITEHEAD'S PHILOSOPHY In his major philosophical work, Process and Reality, Whitehead develops a metaphysical system. He does not, however, postulate the existence of a reality behind reality that is supposedly the most "real" reality. Whitehead is not anoth- er Plato. He is concerned with the reality we all experience. According to White- head, metaphysics, or as he sometimes calls it, speculative philosophy, "is the endeavour to frame a coherent, logical, necessary system of general ideas in terms of which every element of our experience can be interpreted."5 He is not naive: "Philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles."6 It is of course impossible to give in a few pages even a rough outline of his system. Therefore, I will select the elements of Whitehead's thought that are the most important for arriving at a general understanding of what it is all about. These fundamental notions concern the character of reality and the character of experience. In Whitehead's view, reality's most fundamental characteristic is that it is in process, or perhaps I should even say: it is process; it consists of a multiplicity of processes. In accordance with this view of reality as process, Whitehead sees events, not things, as the fundamental elements of which reality consists. The importance of this idea cannot be overestimated. The problem of philosophers (and scientists) who think of the "building blocks" (a very revealing metaphor!) of reality in terms of substances and things is that they cannot see these things as being related to one another. Hume is the best-known exponent of this category of philosophers. In his own (later published) Abstract to the famous A Treatise of Human Nature, he presents us with the example of a billiard ball hitting another ball, which then starts moving. We can see the balls touching each other, and we can see them moving, but we cannot see causality itself, which is, according to Hume, a construct of the human mind.7 He states: "in no single instance the ulti- mate connection of any objects is discoverable, either by our senses or reason, 4. To this might be added that historiography has changed considerably since Porter wrote on the subject. There is now a much stronger awareness among practicing historians of the processual nature of reality, and of the multiplicity of factors involved in the determination of an event, which has at least to a certain extent changed the vocabulary of historiography. For this reason too, my prime focus is on the underpinnings of historiography. 5. Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology [1929] (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 3. 6.

They have justifiably been called windowless. Leibniz needs God to guarantee the relatedness of monads; He is the binding agent between them: "since no created monad can exercise a physical influence upon the interior of any other, this is the only means by which the one can depend upon the other."9 It is hardly surprising that these philosophers are stuck with the problem that, although the idea of causality is so self-evident to us, there seems to be no place for it in "objective reality" itself. The difficulty is that in the end, they always think in terms of "things," "objects" with "substance." The problem with such objects is that they cannot interlock, engage with one another, as events can. The same problem arises when a philosopher like Hume considers the idea of move- ment. I said before, in the example of the billiard balls, that although we cannot see causality, we can see the balls touching and moving. In Hume's opinion, this is still too optimistic a view of reality. When considering movement, Hume can say nothing about it except that it is a human construct. He can only think of objects being at a certain place at a certain time. Because of the division ad infinitum of time and space into moments without duration and points without extension, he would say about a "moving" billiard ball: "it is here; now it is here; and now it is here-but there is no such thing as movement." The line of thought sketched above is in essence ahistorical. Whitehead's phi- losophy, on the other hand, is thoroughly historical. Events are interconnected, they overlap, and one event can be built up out of several others. Events are defined by their relations to others. Moreover, events, even on the tiniest level, have a minimum duration. Whitehead calls this an event's specious present; it is the time the event needs to realize itself. This is in keeping with common sense. Something cannot happen without taking at least some time, however little. "But," someone may object, "when I see a chair, I see a thing, not an event or a series of events!" This is true; what we see in the end is an object, a thing. This is partly due to our mental functioning, to which I will return later. But there is also something in reality itself that makes us see the chair as a thing, as a unity. The "thing-chair" is an abstraction from the underlying "chain of events-chair." In reality, there is a chain of events, both in time and space, which sustains a cer- tain character. Whitehead calls such a chain a nexus. In time, the nexus of events may change a little, because the chair is sat upon very often, or because there is woodworm in it (in which case the changes may not be so small!), but we will still say it is the same chair. I will get back to this theme later on when I come to speak of memory and identity. Whitehead uses several different terms to signify events. He speaks of actual occasions, actual entities, occasions of experience, and sometimes of res verae. Being actual is more than being real. Actuality means "being in process," "hap- 8. Ibid, 257. 9. G. W. von Leibniz, Monadology and Other Philosophical Essays (New York: Macmillan, 1965), 156 (Statement 51).</page><page sequence="5">HISTORY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY IN PROCESS 43 pening at this moment." When an event or actual occasion is completed, it has become real in the sense that it is an accomplished fact.10 It is important to note that an event is also called an occasion of experience. All events have this struc- ture, that there is a subject experiencing one or more objects. We must not think of a subject as necessarily being human; any center of experience can be called a subject. A stone, too, can be a center of experience, and therefore a subject. Everything that is experienced and reacted upon by a subject is an object for this subject. Now when an actual occasion has stopped being actual and has become a real fact it has also made the transition from being a subject (a center of expe- rience) to being an object (potential data for new experiences). When Whitehead speaks of an event or an occasion of experience he does not refer to something totally different from our everyday understanding of the term "event." The Battle of Waterloo is an event, for example, and it consists of many other events on a smaller scale-think of the many battles that were fought between individual French and English soldiers. During such a hand-to-hand fight, many events on an even smaller scale occur, for instance in the body of a soldier; and so we can go on and on. Victor Lowe, writer of Whitehead's biogra- phy, remembers: "When I asked him whether the emission of a single quantum of energy was an actual occasion, he replied, 'Probably a whole shower of actu- al occasions.' "11 What happens in an event is that the (objective) past, insofar as it is relevant to this event, is "inherited" by the event (as subject). The relevant past is experi- enced by the event. This experience may or may not be accompanied by emo- tions and conceptual experience, depending on the type of event. People tend to think of experience as primarily a human thing; most people will say that plants and trees have no real experiences, let alone stones or water or billiard balls. But in Whitehead's philosophy, even a billiard ball can be a center of experience. As far as we know, no emotions or awareness of what is happening are involved in the experience of a billiard ball (otherwise, how cruel the game would be!). Therefore, Whitehead does not use the word "perception" to signify this experi- ence. "Perception" has the connotation of conscious awareness of what is expe- rienced. The same goes for the term "apprehension." Both terms are, as Whitehead says, "shot through and through with the notion of cognitive appre- hension."12 Whitehead introduces the term prehension to signify apprehension "which may or may not be cognitive."'13 By doing so he avoids the pitfall of anthropomorphism when speaking of the experience of non-human subjects. At the same time, he draws attention to the fact that human experience is for the greater part uncognitive. 10. But "real" is in a sense "less" than "actual." It has lost its subjective immediacy. Furthermore, not only the past, but also the future is ("merely") real, according to Whitehead. It is real in the sense that its possible relations to the present are already there.

Idem.</page><page sequence="6">44 ANDERS SCHINKEL As I said, prehension (or a prehension- Whitehead also uses the noun to sig- nify one "unit" of experience) may or may not be cognitive.14 Whether it is, or is likely to be, cognitive depends on the kind of actual occasion. In principle, a dis- tinction can be made between three (non-chronological) phases in a prehension, though not all these phases are relevant when lower-grade occasions are con- cerned. The primary phase is the one in which reality "enters" the prehension; it is the "inheriting of the past" of which I spoke. The second phase is called the supplemental phase. Here, the primary objective content of the experience is joined with certain feelings; it is when, for example, "shape acquires dominance by reason of its loveliness."15 The final, mental phase is the one in which con- sciousness plays a role of importance. By this Whitehead does not mean to say that the last phase is cognitively experienced; the functioning of consciousness to which he refers is something of which the experiencing subject is (largely) unaware. For human beings, it is like walking: you do not think about it, and hav- ing to think about it would make it impossible. Now, in the mental phase, two things happen. First of all, conceptual prehension takes place.16 This is defined as the prehension of eternal objects.17 Three kinds of eternal objects can be distinguished: mathematical forms; sensa (red, sweet, heavy, and so on); and subjective eternal objects (dislike, approval, and so on).18 Eternal objects are also called pure possibilities, because they are possibilities that can be realized in actual occasions. So in the mental phase, not-being can be said to enter the prehension. This means that after the mental phase, the original content of the prehension has undergone some modifications. There is a difference between the objective content of the first phase and the objective content of the last phase, and this difference (in all prehensions of an occasion) constitutes appearance for the occasion in question. Consciousness (in the aforementioned meaning) is the factor in experience that heightens the relevance of the distinction between appearance and reality. This is a source of error, and of creativity. The distinction between appearance and reality is especially important when human beings are concerned, and virtually irrelevant in the case of inorganic actual occasions: "When we pass to inorganic actual occasions, we have lost the two higher originative phases in the 'process,' namely, the 'supplemental' phase, and the 'mental' phase. They are lost in the sense that, so far as our observations go, they are negligible .... The inor- ganic occasions are merely what the causal past allows them to be."19 14. In some of his works, Whitehead uses the term "prehension" to signify the same thing that the terms "event" and "actual occasion," among others, signify. In his greatest philosophical work, Process and Reality, he doesn't use "prehension" and "event" as synonyms. The event is here the greater unity, though they still overlap greatly. Every event or actual occasion is an "occasion of expe- rience" and thus involves prehension. Events are the ultimate elements of reality; there is no going beyond events. They may be analyzed in terms of the prehensions of which they consist, but a pre- hension cannot occur individually--only as a part of an event. 15. Whitehead, Process and Reality, 213. 16. This is not completely restricted to the mental phase. Whitehead says that conceptual prehen- sion is also possible in the supplemental phase. 17. Whitehead, Process and Reality, 23. 18.

Whitehead, Process and Reality, 177.</page><page sequence="7">HISTORY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY IN PROCESS 45 In the following, I will deal strictly with the mental functioning of human beings. As a result of this mental functioning, we are in the end presented with "a mass of presuppositions about Reality rather than Reality itself."20 Let me stress again: we are not aware of this change taking place. Our consciousness operates largely behind our backs. Whitehead remarks that "consciousness is an emphasis upon a selection of ... objects."21 Therefore, the second thing that happens in the mental phase of a pre- hension is that reality is made easier to grasp. What we cognitively get to eat is a pre-masticated version of reality: easy to chew, easy to digest. Whitehead con- cludes: "Mentality is an agent of simplification; and for this reason appearance is an incredibly simplified edition of reality."22 For now, I hope this will do. Some other notions occurring in Whitehead's phi- losophy will be considered later, but I think a solid basis has been laid. The fol- lowing will pursue the course mapped out in the introduction. III. KINDS OF FORGETTING Like Ankersmit, I would like to distinguish among four different kinds of for- getting. My typology, however, will be very different from his. The first type is the kind of forgetting we all do: it's when we have known something but can't think of it anymore. This happens, for example, when we see someone on tele- vision, but can't remember the person's name. The second kind of forgetting is what the historian does, or anyone who tries to reconstruct some "piece" of the past. This doesn't concern the loss of knowledge. It has to do with what we feel is relevant in our reconstruction of the past. Third is what we could call "con- ceptual forgetting." Like the first type of forgetting, this is done by everyone, but scientists, including historians, must be very careful not to do it. The fourth and last type of forgetting is what we usually call "repression": it is forgetting things because we don't want to remember them. Let's start with the (first) kind of forgetting that we all do from time to time (or maybe even all the time!). To clarify what happens when we forget something, a name for instance, or in what year the Battle of Hastings occurred, I would like to compare it to a simple procedure that we perform very often, namely: the dele- tion of files from the hard-disk of our computer. When we delete a file the space it previously occupied is treated as unoccupied, so that another file may be writ- ten in its place. So when we delete a file, the information is not gone; it is still there, but we can't get access to it anymore. If we regret our action and want to retrieve the deleted file, we can try to undelete it. To do this, we need the first let- ter (or other sign) of the file's name. If we remember that, the information can be reactivated. However, the more time that has passed between the deletion and the undeletion, the less likely it is that the file can be retrieved (undamaged), because 20. Alfred North Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas [1933] (Cambridge, Eng.: Cambridge University Press, 1964), 269. 21. Ibid., 182. 22. Ibid., 213-214. From this it is clear why Descartes was mistaken in seeing the clearness and distinctness of ideas as a criterion for their reliability. Reality is neither clear nor distinct. These qual- ifications apply only to what we make of it: a simple picture, with clearly outlined objects in it.</page><page sequence="8">46 ANDERS SCHINKEL something else may have taken its place. The same kind of thing happens when we try to think of a name we have forgotten. Perhaps someone will say: "It starts with a G" and you will suddenly blurt out: "Gary Lineker!" The information has then been restored, or reactivated. But it had to be triggered by something, in this case someone giving you the first letter of Lineker's Christian name. The second kind of forgetting is very different from the first. As I have said, it is the kind of forgetting done by historians or anyone else trying to reconstruct the past. When historians write about some period in the past, they dwell on some aspects of the period under consideration, and only mention others. Some are left out completely. How much attention an aspect receives depends on its impor- tance as perceived by the historians. They make selections of important aspects, which all historians must do, of course, if they do not want to just pile up infor- mation. A similar selection took place long before the historians started writing, while they were still in the process of collecting information and examining sources. Some things will have presented themselves to them as important, and others will have appeared irrelevant (for their purposes). To use the term "for- getting" for what happens here appears to be a bit misleading, then, and it will appear even more so when a comparison is made with the way we perceive things in the present, as I will do in the next paragraph. By "conceptual forgetting" I mean the forgetting of the fact that concepts are only concepts, human constructs, and as such have a history and may change in meaning. More importantly, what a concept refers to in reality may change. Historians (but not only historians) must always bear in mind that there is no one- to-one relationship between concepts and what they refer to. "Conceptual for- getting" is another term for what Whitehead calls the "fallacy of misplaced con- creteness," which consists in "neglecting the degree of abstraction involved when an actual entity is considered merely so far as it exemplifies certain cate- gories of thought."23 Finally, there is what we usually call "repression." It can, with better reason than the second kind of forgetting, be called "forgetting," because it involves the same loss of information as the "normal" kind of forgetting. There is a big dif- ference, however, for the forgetting of the fourth kind is somehow unconscious- ly desired, which is normally not the case. This may occur, for instance, when a person has had a traumatic experience, or out of a strong feeling of guilt. In this article, I will mainly be concerned with the second and third kinds of forgetting (the former of which is not really "forgetting"). Sometimes, however, different kinds of forgetting may go hand in hand. As with all strict distinctions, the ones made above are artificial and to a certain extent arbitrary-but they are nevertheless useful. Perception, consciousness, and importance As we have seen, in Whitehead's view, experience is not reserved to conscious life-forms. Human experience, furthermore, is for the greater part unconscious, in the sense that we are not cognitively aware of it. A brief recapitulation: 23. Whitehead, Process and Reality, 7-8. For a general treatment of the "fallacy of misplaced con- creteness" see Science and the Modern World, 66-72.</page><page sequence="9">HISTORY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY IN PROCESS 47 "Consciousness [our mental functioning] is an emphasis upon a selection of ... objects." This is Whitehead's main point. He also calls it "a mode of attention."24 Whitehead's conclusion is: "Mentality is an agent of simplification." So in our perception of reality (which is cognitive), the importance of some elements of experience is raised, whereas other elements are pushed to the back- ground. This has already happened when we perceive reality, or start to think about it. We are not aware of the selection being made, and the emphasis being given. This is a good thing, too, for otherwise we would probably drown in an enormous ocean of vague impressions. Just now I deliberately spoke of the importance of elements in our experience being raised. "Importance" literally refers to the contribution being made by something to some other thing. The important thing about importance is that it belongs to reality as well as to appearance. Some events are more important for a certain event than others, which import less. In much the same way, some ele- ments in our experience have more importance in appearance than others. It depends on their contribution to our perception. Whitehead points out how strongly related in meaning the words "importance" and "interest" are.25 Both refer to some kind of involvement.26 Now how does this relate to history? Surely we cannot experience or perceive the past the same way we perceive present reality? Indeed, this goes without say- ing. But there is an important qualification to be made concerning our perception of the present: we never actually perceive the present. Whitehead makes clear that on an occasion of experience, it is always the immediate past that is experi- enced. Furthermore, there are important similarities between our perception of the past and our perception of the "present." As I said before, historians select from their sources the elements of importance. For the greater part, they do so without being aware of it. The functioning of consciousness in the (indirect) per- ception of the past is the same as in the (direct) perception of the present: it sim- plifies, it directs our attention. The difference between the way we perceive the present and the way the past is perceived lies in the fact that the subjectivity (in the form of the emphasis laid upon a selection of "objects") is, in the latter case, squared. The written sources historians have at their disposal are the result of the same kind of selection procedure as the one taking place in historians' minds. What was then felt to be important-which is no guarantee for its actual impor- tance in a broader context than the experience of the source's author-is more likely to have a great importance assigned to it now. So we get a selection from a selection, an emphasis on what was already emphasized.27 But is this indeed so very different from our perception of the present? This depends on what we mean by "the present." If we mean "the present situation directly perceived by the sub- 24. Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas, 269. 25. Alfred North Whitehead, Modes of Thought [1938] (New York: The Free Press, 1968), 8. 26. This is in line with Whitehead's view of the relation between subject and object. Objects are not passively perceived by subjects. The subject, Whitehead says, has a concern for the object (Adventures of Ideas, 178). 27. This might temper the optimism of Dale Porter a bit, who claims on the basis of his reading of Whitehead that "in practice, the occasion does not describe or explain the whole world any more thor- oughly than does the historian" (Porter, "History as Process," 306).</page><page sequence="10">48 ANDERS SCHINKEL ject in question," than there is a difference, because only one selection is made. But if we mean "the present situation in the world," for instance, the difference evaporates, because everything we get to know about events, in whatever part of the world, that we have not ourselves witnessed has undergone the same selec- tion procedure historians' sources have. So historians may overlook things that are important. Perhaps they will do so because they are things they do not want to see. They can be like a chain-smok- er who does not see the billboards of an anti-smoking campaign. This is indeed what we usually call "selective perception." But this is misleading, because all perception is selective-this is just an extreme example. The same principle of selection applies to memory. Without our cognitive involvement, our conscious- ness "deletes" irrelevant information, as Ankersmit points out as well. Our mem- ory is necessarily selective: we cannot remember everything vividly. Again, some things will virtually disappear in the background, whereas other things will remain close to the surface, ready to be called upon. Repression is an extreme case of selective memory, just as our smoker offered an extreme example of selective perception. Which selection is made, be it in our perception of the present or the past or in our memory, is always influenced by a person's feelings, character, interests, and so on. In the case of repression (of traumatic experiences), these factors assert a stronger influence than usual. But the subjective influence is always there, in the form of the importance assigned to events, in the form of the histo- rian's interest. Does this make every selection made by a historian a purely sub- jective selection? Is a historical interpretation merely an opinion? These ques- tions are examined in the next section. IV. SUBJECTIVITY, OBJECTIVITY, AND TRUTH As a result of the belief that people are subjects who find external reality placed as an object, or rather an enormous pile of objects, in front of them, we speak of an "objective standpoint" as being a non-personal standpoint that captures reali- ty and is therefore trustworthy. A "subjective standpoint" is the opposite of this: it is not reliable, because it is personal and as a result is contaminated with one person's taste, preferences, feelings, and so on.28 In modem philosophy, the distinction between appearance and reality is grounded upon the distinction between subject and object. The idea has been broadly accepted that, because our experience is always subjective, we cannot know reality itself, but only its appearance. This places historians (among others) in an awkward position. Historians try to say something about historical reality. 28. There is a strange paradox here. In the bulk of recent philosophy, it is only the subject who can give meaning to the world "outside." It is held that there is none in reality itself, in contrast to what premodern thinkers believed. I speak of "meaning" in a very broad sense here: the subject determines what is good or bad, ugly or beautiful; the subject perceives things as causally related; the subject makes classifications in flora and fauna. The subject has to make sense of an in-itself senseless world. But paradoxically, this renders the objective standpoint incoherent: it alone supposedly reveals the meaning of the world, but since meaning can only come from the subject, meaning therefore becomes meaningless.</page><page sequence="11">HISTORY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY IN PROCESS 49 In other words: they hope that there is truth in what they say. It is not their inten- tion merely to express some subjective feelings about something that supposed- ly happened in the past. What drives historians is the idea that they can say some- thing about what really happened-not everything, but certainly not nothing. How can historians defend themselves against those who dismiss their work as mere subjective opinions, as appearance? I suggest that we take a closer look at the inheritance from Descartes. Does it make sense to divide the world up so strictly into subjects and objects? Is it plausible to say that nothing of the objec- tive world can be found in our subjective perception, or that we can never know what is reality, and what is appearance? Following Whitehead, I would say no to both questions. We have already seen that Whitehead holds that objective reality enters into each prehension and every occasion of experience. In occasions where mentality plays a role of importance, as is the case with human beings, there will be a sig- nificant difference between appearance and reality. But there can be a truth-rela- tion between appearance and reality. Furthermore, Whitehead holds that qualita- tive aspects of objective reality can enter into the appearance. In this, he disagrees fundamentally with Descartes, who saw the objective world as practically bare of qualities. According to Whitehead, every actuality (as a consequence of being involved in process) is a subject, in the sense that it experiences the relevant past, and after its completion is an object for other subjects. As I said before, every cen- ter of experience can be called a subject. The world is therefore full of subjects, the majority of which are not human. It could be said that the world is an experi- encing world. From this it follows that "apart from the experiences of subjects there is nothing, nothing, nothing, bare nothingness."29 However, this does not mean that there is no objective world; it means that the objective world is at the same time subjective. It experiences and is experienced. So we are not dealing with some form of philosophical idealism here. It is not a matter of esse est per- cipi, for Whitehead replaces "perception" by prehension. That nothing exists that is not prehended means that nothing exists in isolation. There is nothing that is not somehow related to something else. Some object may not be perceived by any human being or animal, but it is still prehended by its environment. In the context of this article, we are naturally concerned with human experience, but it is good to keep in mind that in principle all experience, in human or nonhu- man subjects, is of the same kind. With regard to human experience, Whitehead describes "subjectivism" as "the belief that the nature of our immediate experience is the outcome of the perceptive peculiarities of the subject enjoying the experi- ence."30 It is clear that he himself does not share this belief. The first component of any experience is the objective world that is relevant for the actual occasion in question. The supplemental phase and the mental phase "add" subjectivity to the occasion. This subjectivity can be strong, but it can also be virtually absent. So is there such a thing as purely subjective perception, in the sense that the content of the perception is entirely the result of "the perceptive peculiarities of the subject enjoying the experience"? Of course not. Experience always involves 29. Whitehead, Process and Reality, 167. 30. Whitehead, Science and the Modern World, 107.</page><page sequence="12">50 ANDERS SCHINKEL both objects and a subject. The way I perceive a tree is different from the way my brother perceives the same tree, and we attach different feelings and associations to it, but we both perceive a tree; my brother does not see big branches where I do not, and we agree more or less on the color of the leaves. Our perception is partly determined by the objects of experience, and partly by our own bodily and mental constitution. As Kant tried to show us concerning this second factor, per- ception works in the same way in all human beings. But historical interpretations can still be colored too strongly by subjective factors. Objective reality has entered into historians' perception, yes-but what have they done with it? How has it been modified? I would like to concentrate on the selection made by historians of what is important and what is relatively unimportant, because this is the essence of historical interpretation: the weighing of the importance of factors.31 So we return to the notion of "importance." As I said before, we can distin- guish between the importance an event has in reality (process/the stream of events), and the importance an event has in the appearance created by the men- tal functioning of historians. Important events will be more likely than others to leave traces, as they contribute relatively more to the future. That means that these events have a greater chance of being important in the perception of histo- rians. However, there are no absolute guarantees here. Some important events leave no visible traces, and even if they do, it is still possible that historians will not acknowledge their importance, or that they are left out of their unconscious- ly made selections. Moreover, the body of sources historians have at their dis- posal is the result of selections made in the past, and as a consequence subjec- tivity is multiplied. It follows that something else is needed to secure the "objectivity" of histori- cal interpretations. This "something else" is a reference to truth. As Whitehead says, "truth is a qualification which applies to appearance alone."32 This is evi- dent; a table cannot be true or false, only statements about it can. We must define truth as "the conformation of Appearance to Reality."33 To some readers this may sound naive; perhaps the definition will remind them of the younger Wittgenstein. But Whitehead's is not a simple theory of correspondence. Different truth-relations are possible. A landscape painting in the style of the Impressionists has a truth-relation to the depicted landscape, and the same holds true for a seventeenth- or eighteenth-century "realist" painting of the same land- scape. Whitehead says: "if we ask what is meant by 'truth,' we can only answer that there is a truth-relation when two composite facts participate in the same pat- tern. Then knowledge about one of the facts involves knowledge about the other, so far as the truth-relation extends."34 In some cases, we will find truth and untruth combined, for instance when we see an image in a mirror. The image will participate in the same (although mir- 31. This "weighing of importance" happens both uncognitively and cognitively. The challenge for historians is to make themselves aware, to the greatest possible extent, of the uncognitive processes that precede their perception. 32. Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas, 240. 33. Idem. 34. Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas, 241.</page><page sequence="13">HISTORY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY IN PROCESS 51 rored) pattern as the object reflected by the mirror. But the image in the mirror suggests that there is a space behind the surface, which in reality is not there at all. There may be a cupboard behind the mirror, with old boots in it and a box of tools, for example, but these objects and this space do not participate in the same pattern as the space and objects the mirror showed us. Luckily, we have means of finding out what is true and what is not. In the case of the cupboard behind the mirror, we can just open the mirror-door, and we will know that the image was at least in one way deceptive. The same principle can be applied to historical writing, and has been for a very long time. It is evident that some historical interpretations are more plausible, more likely to be true, than others. Hayden White, cum suis, however, would say that there are only aesthetic and moral grounds for choosing between historical interpretations.35 Perez Zagorin, following Roger Chartier, opposes this view; he remarks: "there seems to be no basis under White's view for invoking the facts of the historical record to refute the rewriting of history in revisionist narratives which allege that the Holocaust is a myth invented by Zionist propaganda and that the death camps and gas chambers never existed."36 Obviously, there are these facts. As St. Augustine says, "The historian does not himself produce the sequence of events which he narrates."37 Saying that the gas chambers never existed means ignoring an enormous amount of evidence. It is "desired forget- ting," if it can be called forgetting at all. It follows from Whitehead's philosophy that historical writing can be true in many different ways. A historical work may be true to reality in the way it cap- tures the "atmosphere" of a certain time-but this is very difficult to ascertain. It may also be true in a more statistical way, or because factors have been given the right measure of importance. Some of these things are more easily demonstrated than others. But the ways to do so are not new: a critical handling of sources, the use of as many different sources as possible, and so on. The "subjective" element in historical writing is reduced and corrected by discussions between historians of different "schools."38 It can also be reduced by making ourselves aware as much as possible of the selections we make. In the end we can never be completely sure about the truth of a historical interpretation; no interpretation will capture "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."39 But there are no grounds what- soever for dismissing the notion of truth from the realm of historiography. 35.

HISTORY, MEMORY, AND IDENTITY From the way I have been talking about finding the truth about history, it may appear that there is an almost unbridgeable gap between the present and the past. Historians, it seems, can only gather clues-look for the traces left by events in the past, which resemble the footsteps of a dinosaur. But the past cannot be felt, for it is gone. Or is it? Ankersmit links the notions of history and memory to the notion of identity. He asserts that certain events in history (preceded, perhaps, by unnoticed changes in the consciousness of people) may cause a radical break-up between past and pres- ent (or future), in which a civilization's identity is lost and a new one formed, con- sisting primarily of the awareness of the loss of the former identity. His article deals with "the kind of forgetting taking place when a civilization 'commits sui- cide' by exchanging a previous identity for a new one."40 The past really is gone here, and with it an identity. A civilization that has been maltreated by fortune in this manner could be compared to a person who, because of an accident (being hit by a car, for instance), has completely lost his or her memory. Such a person has also lost his or her identity, and a new identity in formation will be greatly influ- enced by this person's painful knowledge that he or she once was someone else. This raises two important questions. The first is whether or not a civilization can justifiably be compared to a single person. Is not the main characteristic of a civilization that it consists of and is upheld by many people? This does not nec- essarily exclude the possibility that a comparison between a civilization and a sin- gle person could be fruitful in some contexts, but in the present context it seems to be a bit of a problem. The second question is whether there is an equivalent of "being hit by a car and losing one's memory as a consequence" on the scale of civilizations. From a process perspective, both suggestions are problematic. I will start with the first question. An individual's identity relies on mental and bodily continuity. It is because a person's past is continually inherited by this per- son, by one's new cells, that one can be said to remain the same person. The phys- ical and mental "memory" constitutes identity; it makes it possible for someone to say "That's me!" on seeing a picture of himself or herself taken years ago.41 At the basis of this lies a series of related events sustaining a character as a whole, to put it in Whiteheadian terms.42 This involves a certain stability in the way this "whole" reacts to other events. To put it crudely: you would be rather surprised if a good friend, with whom you always go bowling (which your friend evidently enjoys), all of a sudden said, "No, I'm not coming; I hate bowling!" However, it is conceivable that, were he to be hit by a car and completely lose his memory, he would no longer like bowling. He might react differently to other things as well. What about civilizations? Do they have an identity? Do they "sustain a char- acter" over time? I would say they do. But we must realize that in pointing out a 40. Ankersmit, "The Sublime Dissociation of the Past," 295. 41. Of course, identity also has a social constituent. Even people who lose their memory will, in some respects, remain the same person for others. They will still be the son of. . ., the wife of. . etc. But here also, identity depends on the historical constants. 42. See, for example, Whitehead, Modes of Thought 99. Whitehead himself does not use the term "identity" in connection with this sustained character of what he calls a "nexus" of events.</page><page sequence="15">HISTORY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY IN PROCESS 53 person's or a civilization's identity we make an abstraction; we abstract unity from diversity. "Civilization" is the name for an enormous multiplicity of events. It is the relation of an "object" as a "thing" to the events that build it, which we see exemplified here. You may have an old cupboard at home that once belonged to your great-grandparents. In time, some pieces of board may have been replaced, and the doorknobs may have been exchanged for new ones, but you would still think of it as the same old cupboard. Objects can remain the same in spite of events whereby material is lost or replaced. Although, like an individual person, a civilization can be said to have an iden- tity, there is a problem with the comparison of a civilization to a single person. An individual's body can only react to an accident in one way. The person's iden- tity may be altered completely or it may be lost and replaced by a new one. But even if a civilization could in totality be involved in anything like an accident, not every "member" of the civilization would react in the same way. Some peo- ple will remain virtually unaffected by the event, others will get killed; and the great mass of poor people will remain poor, and will be ruled in much the same way-by other people than before, perhaps, but maybe also by the same. Therefore, if people start forgetting what happened, it will be "desired forget- ting" in some cases, and "normal forgetting" in others. The next question is: can a civilization lose an identity completely, as a person might by being hit by a car, or as a cupboard might by being smashed to bits with an axe (and even then the remains would be recognizable!)? Can a civilization be involved in (a large-scale equivalent of) an accident? From the point of view taken by process philosophy, this is not very likely, perhaps even impossible. Whitehead remarks that "each historic route of like occasions tends to prolong itself."43 This is due to the uniformity of what each occasion in such a route inherits from the past. In a route of similar occasions, the past itself suggests no alternatives. I will give an example most people will recognize. The effect Whitehead refers to is something one can witness in almost every family: at a certain age, a child is absolutely determined that in the future, as a parent, it will do things differently. In most cases, however, the child turns out to be a parent very similar to its own. The longer the route of occasions, the greater the unifor- mity will be, and the stronger the tendency to prolong itself. Change, therefore, is never abrupt, at least not on the scale of civilizations. Let us consider one of Ankersmit's examples: the French Revolution--unde- niably an event of enormous impact. The Western world changed, no doubt; but had it, as Ankersmit says, "acquired a new identity"?44 I would not put it that strongly. In my opinion, it sounds too much as if before 1789 Western (or French?) civilization had a certain fixed identity, which was then suddenly lost, to be replaced by a completely new identity. And thinking of "a civilization's identity" as fixed is an example of conceptual forgetting; of the "fallacy of mis- placed concreteness." When we say: "this is the identity of this civilization," we abstract from a constantly changing reality. It is like placing a stick in a stream in an attempt to stop its flow. 43. Whitehead, Process and Reality, 56. 44. Ankersmit, "The Sublime Dissociation of the Past," 304.</page><page sequence="16">54 ANDERS SCHINKEL Although the (symbolic) impact of a "single event" must not be underestimat- ed, the view presented by Ankersmit is, from my (process) perspective, too unhistorical. Tocqueville had already pointed out that the events of 1789 were no cause in themselves, but only channeled what had been caused by many differ- ent developments. He states: "Without doubt there has never been a revolution so powerful, so quick, so destructive and so creative as the French. But one would be oddly mistaken if one believed that an entirely new French people arose from it, and that this people would have raised a building for which the foundations did not previously exist."45 At one point in Ankersmit's article, in discussing Hegel's interpretation of the condemning of Socrates by the Athenians, he also draws attention to the slow, invisible processes that precede events of great influence: "The past was a mere empty shell; but the Greeks could still see only the shell and not yet the new content that had gradually filterered into it. So Socrates merely made conscious . . . what had come into being already."46 This bears a striking resemblance to the idea that Whitehead express- es in the following passage: We notice that a great idea in the background of dim consciousness is like a phantom ocean beating upon the shores of human life in successive waves of specialization. A whole succession of such waves are as dreams slowly doing their work of sapping the base of some cliff of habit: but the seventh wave is a revolution-"And the nations echo round.",47 So when the cliff breaks, this event seems to appear out of the blue, whereas in fact it was preceded by a gradual weakening of the cliff. Changes do not occur suddenly, although it may seem as if they do. To answer the second question: if we may rely on Tocqueville, the French Revolution cannot be compared to an accident, nor can it be said that an identi- ty was suddenly lost. The French Revolution was no absolute caesura. Many processes often seen as caused by the Revolution had started far earlier, and were simply continued, perhaps at a somewhat greater speed. The French Revolution represents a change in the identity of French civilization (and beyond that, of the whole of western Europe), but not the death of an identity. Although there is change, there is also continuity. There is, in a way, an unbridgeable gap between the past and the present: we cannot go back in time. But there is no such gap in the sense that the present would be completely different from the past--not even after an event like the French Revolution. The past is always with us. When an event is completed and has become an object for subjects to come, it has gained what Whitehead calls "objective immortality"; the event has become an unalter- able fact, with importance in and for the future. And although Ankersmit is right in pointing out that events like the French Revolution trigger the formation of myths about the past, this does not mean that there is no memory at all of the time before the event in question occurred. Something new and important has been 45. Alexis de Tocqueville, Over de Franse Revolutie, ed. J. M. M. de Valk (Kampen: Kok Agora, 1988), 41 (my translation). 46.

VI. CONCLUSION One way to make one's own position clear is to set it off against another (well- known) position. Whitehead makes use of this method to clarify what process philosophy (in the following example referred to as "philosophy of organism") stands for. Whitehead contrasts process philosophy with that of Kant: "For Kant, the world emerges from the subject; for the philosophy of organism, the subject emerges from the world ... ."48 The consequences of the view that "the subject emerges from the world" are manifold. It means that there is no absolute gap between subject and object, between our minds and reality "outside." It also means that there is no such gap between the present and the past, for "emerging from the world" necessarily means "emerging from the past." What we experience now has its cause in the immediate past. Furthermore, what we are now has its roots in history. We must not forget that as human beings we carry with us, in our genes, an evolution of millions of years. Even the genetic information that is specific to our species is thousands of years old. So process philosophy stresses the continuity between past, present, and future. It also emphasizes the fact that any event is connected to many other events. There is no such thing as an isolated event. Whitehead says: An event has contemporaries. This means that an event mirrors within itself the modes of its contemporaries as a display of immediate achievement. An event has a past. This means that an event mirrors within itself the modes of its predecessors, as memories which are fused into its own content. An event has a future. This means that an event mir- rors within itself such aspects as the future throws back on to the present, or, in other words, as the present has determined concerning the future.49 The way one thinks about reality has implications for the way one thinks about knowledge and truth. Ontology and epistemology are not philosophical islands, completely isolated, exerting no influence upon each other. On the contrary: epistemology and ontology support one another. From Whitehead's claim that "the subject emerges from the world," it follows that a perspective is never com- pletely subjective. An individual's perspective is constituted by the position this individual has in the world, by the place he or she occupies in the spatio-tempo- ral network of events internal and external to his or her body.50 So the perspec- tive is unique to this subject, but therefore not purely subjective. A perspective arises from both objective and subjective factors. 48. Whitehead, Process and Reality, 88. This is not to say that for Kant the world does not precede the subject, because it does in a way; our impressions have a cause outside us. But the world that we normally speak about is the phenomenal world, and this originates in the subject. 49. Whitehead, Science and the Modern World, 90-91. 50. There is no hundred-percent determination here. In Whitehead's view, people are to a certain extent free. The problem of freedom and determination is not the issue here, however, so I will not look into it any further.</page><page sequence="18">56 ANDERS SCHINKEL This means that there is a basis for speaking about truth. Were there no con- nection between the "world of the subject" and the "world of the object," it would be nonsense to speak of truth. We would not be able to verify anything. This is the world of postmodern philosophy, where relativism rules supreme. Whitehead's philosophy gives us a handhold, or rather, it recognizes the hand- hold we already have. We are able to recognize the truth or falsity of propositions about reality, though not always. Pointing out that different people hold different views on certain subjects does not prove that there is no truth in these matters; to claim that is to commit a logical error. The conclusion for historians is that they are justified in aiming at the truth. They will have to try to be aware as much as possible of the selections they make, of the "forgetting" they do, in short: of the "subjective" factor in historiography. Historians will have to correct and supplement one another-and when all this is done, we will still not have absolute guarantees about the truth of our visions. But this is no cause for worry; have we not always known, that errare humanum est?51 Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam 51.
