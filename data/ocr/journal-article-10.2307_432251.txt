<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHERYL FOSTER The Narrative and the Ambient in Environmental Aesthetics A cleft has emerged at the heart of contempo- rary philosophical thinking about aesthetics and the natural environment. This paper attempts to identify, analyze, and compare what lies on either side of the fissure-dichotomous approaches to aesthetic value in relation to nature-and argues for the necessity of both approaches even as it defends the neglected integrity of one (what I call the ambient dimension of aesthetic value) against the current dominance of the other (la- beled the narrative dimension of aesthetic value). Neither approach in isolation can fully articulate the experience of nature as it gives rise to what we might know of aesthetic value. In ex- ploring the cleft between the narrative and the ambient in environmental aesthetics, I hope to demonstrate their particular modes of applica- bility as well as their mutual interdependence, thus enlarging the frame of reference for our in- quiry as a whole. If we want to argue for the importance of aes- thetic values in relation to the natural environ- ment, and wish to persuade others of those val- ues, we must first have confidence that the premises for our argument grow out of and re- main firmly rooted in what we can reasonably be said to know. Speaking of "aesthetic knowl- edge," or what we can know through aesthetic experience, however, is not so straightforward as it might appear. Traditionally in this century Anglo-American philosophers have withheld epistemological integrity from most things be- yond verifiable propositions. To know meant, quite simply, to determine that a proposition was true in virtue of the justifiable evidence available to support it. The evidence might in the end be empirical, but some philosophers of language especially have steered the focus of their analyses toward the semantic content of propositions, such that conceptual cohesion de- termines the reliability of any claim to know. Yet Frank Sibley has argued persuasively and at length for the idea that aesthetic judgments, or aesthetic knowledge about objects and events, issue only from empirical acquaintance. We must perceive the thing about which we claim to know in order to have our judgments taken seri- ously. In addition, Sibley has argued that, even if one knew the perceptual properties of and conceptual facts about an object prior to en- countering it, one could nevertheless not judge the aesthetic qualities or impact of the object until perceiving it for oneself.' Sibley claims that one cannot derive necessarily true or even appropriate aesthetic predicates from proposi- tional knowledge about an object's physical or genetic properties. Thus, a young, unfurling forest fern could not be judged as "vulnerable" or "tenuous" until one had actually observed it for oneself, even if one could otherwise know ahead of time the color, size, shape, age, con- text, and composition of the fern. In one sense this flies in the face of our cul- ture's current thinking about what constitutes knowledge proper. "Knowledge," as something that offers both accurate predictions for the fu- ture and withstands analysis through reasonable investigation of evidence, transcends any par- ticular individual to constitute a body of infor- mation transmittable in the form of reliable propositions and scientific laws. The challenge for defending claims made about aesthetic value thus becomes: Are we willing to enlarge what we think of as knowledge to include the individ- ual's perceptual acquaintance with and respect for the natural environment, and support the va- lidity of such knowledge in our account of aes- thetic value? The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 56:2 Spring 1998</page><page sequence="2">128 Here I argue that it is possible to question, clarify, and extend the frame of aesthetic value reference to emphasize the perceptual element of knowledge, given that the aesthetic seems in- dubitably bound up with knowledge by acquain- tance in some key way. In a wider sense our task is to tease out what aesthetic experience entails before the aesthetic as a source of value can be balanced with other, diverse forms of value. If I am right about the dichotomous character of current aesthetic theory in relation to the natural world-if many of the most cohesive and rep- utable theories fall into either the narrative or the ambient dimension of value-then this will qualify any straightforward solution to the problem of how to determine, express, and in- voke aesthetic value in the broader effort to pre- serve natural environments. II Questioning, clarifying, and extending the ways we articulate the aesthetic value of the natural environment results in a paradox for the practi- cal application of what we derive from that ques- tioning process. The paradox ensues from the fact that one of the more powerful and enduring kinds of experiences in the formation of aes- thetic appreciation of nature resists direct or clear expression in discursive prose. I call this sort of experience the "ambient" dimension of aesthetic value, and in so doing contrast it to some degree with what I shall term the "narra- tive" dimension of aesthetic value.2 While both dimensions have merit and reflect vital ap- proaches to nature appreciation, the ambient di- mension as a valid or serious source for aes- thetic value has been less prominent within professional philosophic discourse. Why has the ambient dimension of aesthetic value been marginalized in such discourse? Per- haps the legitimacy of the ambient dimension can be questioned because of its association with a philosophical tradition that takes subjec- tivity seriously as a vantage point from which to query and establish forms of value: If a point of view is subjective, then it lacks objectivity, and if it lacks objectivity, then it cannot possibly fall within the range of considerations upon which we make our judgments. I shall argue that our as- sumptions about more and less legitimate sources of aesthetic value in nature could be misguided, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism and if misguided, call for a re-examination of current environmental aesthetic theory, where science overshadows other, less quantifiable or direct frameworks for aesthetic assessment. Yrjfo Sep~a~nmaa explores the search for a link between aesthetic assessment and the search for reliable contexts of appreciation in his book The Beauty of Environment and concludes that "the task of environmental aesthetics in a meta- critical sense is the theoretical control of the de- scription, interpretation and evaluation of the environment and the creation of a frame of ref- erence. It constructs a model of how the en- vironment is received, and in what ways it op- erates as an aesthetic object."3 Drawing on Sep'a'nmaa's metacritical approach to evaluating models of aesthetic appreciation, I have ob- served that most models of environmental as- sessment taking shape today promote what I am calling the narrative dimension, a frame of ref- erence that privileges the relationship between the visible or perceptual natural surface and the invisible or intangible events and processes be- neath, behind, or before it. Let me clarify this more accepted narrative dimension of aesthetic value with regard to the natural environment. The narrative dimension tethers perceptual features of the natural envi- ronment to diverse frameworks of conceptual in- formation and locates aesthetic value in the ca- pacity of the perceiver to make appreciative judgments about nature's features within the context of, or with reference to, the framework through which they are viewed. One example of the narrative dimension of aesthetic value at work can be seen in the tendency of aesthetic theorists and nature writers to allude to the mythological or social history linked to the sur- face they are surveying. Diane Ackerman does this to great effect in her book A Natural History of the Senses. In a chapter on the aesthetic power of vision, Ackerman recalls her visit to Big Sur along the California coast between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Of the many ways to watch the sky, one of the most familiar is through the filigree limbs of a tree, or around and above the trees; this has much to do with how we actually see and observe the sky. Trees con- duct the eye from the ground up to the heavens, link the detailed temporariness of life with the bulging blue abstraction overhead. In Norse legend, the huge</page><page sequence="3">Foster The Narrative and the Ambient in Environmental Aesthetics 129 ash tree Yggdrasil, with its great arching limbs and three swarming roots, stretched high into the sky, holding the universe together, connecting earth to both heaven and hell. ... We find trees offering us knowledge in many of the ancient stories and legends, perhaps because they alone seem to unite the earth and the sky-the known, invadable world with everything that is beyond our grasp and our power.4 Ackerman begins with an observation about the formal allure of trees and ends with a kind of metaphysical speculation about their mytholog- ical value, drawing attention in her observations to a confluence between the perceptual charac- teristics of trees and the ways those characteris- tics inform the manufacture of human mythology. But the narrative dimension of aesthetic value exceeds the fictional or imaginative signifi- cance of natural landscapes. Indeed, the most widely accepted forms of the narrative dimen- sion of aesthetic value favor factual frameworks over mythological ones. Marcia Muelder Eaton has alluded to the appeal of this interface be- tween fact and value in her book Aesthetics and the Good Life: Good environments often func- tion as legible environments, reflections of the degree to which we can draw on nonperceptual information to form the landscape into a coher- ent and patterned whole.5 Consider this passage from the guidebook Walks and Rambles in Rhode Island by Rhode Island naturalist and journalist Ken Weber, where a walk through a 1,500-acre forest management area is introduced. The route described here ... is likely to keep you in- terested. You start near a tiny cemetery, pass another graveyard (surrounded by a picket fence) hidden far back in the woods, visit a couple of old cellar holes, take a look at a campsite for canoeists along the Paw- catuck River, pause in a clearing where apple and pear trees continue to survive long after abandon- ment, and walk along fields planted for the benefit of wildlife.6 In Weber's description, the legacy of a human community that has long since left the woods underscores the natural sense of solitude on this forest walk. Here the forest shelters the rem- nants of a human past, a past that can be identi- fied in the explicit traces it leaves among the trees and brooks and fields. The narrative di- mension of aesthetic value reads the human his- tory of agrarian management into a reclaimed forest landscape and broadens our appreciation of its formal qualities to include the resonance of social and natural time passing through the stark contemplation of ruins. Still another narrative form of aesthetic value privileges natural history and the frameworks of science for understanding and seeing what na- ture reveals through its surface. The depth of time beneath the formal and perceptual features cannot be seen by the naive eye and thus must be understood, rather than observed, as directly in- fluencing the perceptual surface. Through a grasp of previously present processes we can read the natural environment as the offspring of its pro- genitors and see its perceptual features as mani- festations of those progenitors. As Holmes Rol- ston has noted, "Without science, there is no sense of deep time, nor of geological or evolu- tionary history, and little appreciation of ecol- ogy. Science cultivates the habit of looking closely, as well as of looking for long periods of time. One is more likely to experience the land- scape at multiple scales of both space and time."7 This conceptual expansion of perceptual space by consciousness of time relies again and again on our grasp of a history, our awareness during aesthetic encounters of the unseen march of events and processes that manifest their traces in natural environments. Although Rolston ar- gues for the necessity (but not the sufficiency) of science-based accounts of natural time in any rich aesthetic reading of the natural environ- ment, others extend the relevance of history to the humanistic element of appreciation struc- tured by time. Yuriko Saito acknowledges the importance of science while simultaneously ex- ploring other avenues of appreciative entry into nature, while Eaton argues that "the theoretical foundation for aesthetic assessment of the envi- ronment (and for everything else) rests in aware- ness of the history of values. Aesthetic delight is determined largely by tradition. Scientific stud- ies of preference or viewer psychology will be truly objective only if they are placed within a humanistic context."9 This context illuminates the intrinsic properties of the thing in which we take aesthetic delight, but the preferences of culture and tradition serve as the watermark of that context. The current emphasis in environ- mental aesthetic theory on the pre-eminence of scientific readings of the natural environment</page><page sequence="4">130 may on this view reveal a great deal about the standards and interests of our own contempo- rary culture, a culture that privileges informa- tion and the application of it in search of a wider acquaintance with the physical processes sup- porting the world. In considering science as one narrative di- mension of aesthetic value, think of the New England region of the United States, where au- tumn brings about a remarkable transformation in various deciduous trees. We call the season "fall" in deference to the dropping of spectacu- larly colored leaves from their homes in the trees. But what we call the season has less im- portance, for a science-based narrative of aes- thetic appreciation, than an explanation of why the dropping of leaves occurs and how the pro- cess manifests itself in the season's perceptual surface. Diane Ackerman again provides a suit- able example. First she explores the changing of deciduous leaves from green into reds, yellows, oranges, and umbers. In the dog days of summer the tree begins pulling nu- trients back into its trunk and roots, pares down, and gradually chokes off its leaves. A corky layer of cells forms at the leaves' slender petioles, then scars over. Undernourished, the leaves stop producing the pig- ment chlorophyll, and photosynthesis ceases. A turning leaf stays partly green at first, then reveals splotches of yellow and red as the chlorophyll gradu- ally breaks down. Dark green seems to stay the longest in the veins, outlining and defining them. During the summer, chlorophyll dissolves in the heat and light, but it is also being steadily replaced. In the fall, on the other hand, no new pigment is produced, and so we notice the other colors that were always right there, right in the leaf, although chlorophyll's shocking green hid them from view.10 And why do the brilliantly revealed, multi- colored leaves drop from the trees? As a leaf ages, the growth hormone, auxin, fades, and cells at the base of the petiole divide. Two or three rows of small cells, lying at right angles to the axis of the petiole, react with water, then come apart, leaving the petioles hanging on by only a few threads of xylem. A light breeze, and the leaves are airborne.' 1 Ackerman's narrative brings dynamic but un- seen processes to bear on the dramatic chro- The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism matic changes in autumn leaves and allows us to understand the perceptual surface of the envi- ronment as an index of cellular and environ- mental changes we cannot witness directly. Knowledge of plant physiology here contributes to seeing nature as an index of what Rolston calls deep time, of processes and events beneath and before the perceptual properties we sense in front of us. The most prolific and consistent champion of science as the appropriate framework for a proper aesthetic reading of the natural environ- ment is Allen Carlson. In a series of articles ap- pearing during the last twenty years, Carlson has progressively and persuasively argued for the relevance of scientific categories of under- standing to objective aesthetic judgments about the natural environment. In one of his more re- cent undertakings, 'Appreciating Art and Ap- preciating Nature," Carlson not only reaffirms what he sees as a disjunction between the proper aesthetic appreciation of art and that of nature, but also shifts the language of his argument away from a traditional aesthetic emphasis on formal beauty and toward a more overt acknowl- edgment of the dimension I have been discussing, the narrative dimension of aesthetic value. Carlson differentiates "design appreciation," which recognizes and applies the details of human intention and creation to the apprecia- tion of artifacts, from "order appreciation," in which an individual appreciates a natural object by reference to general nonaesthetic and non- artistic accounts of its genesis. Both modes of appreciation illuminate the various forces that produced the object under consideration, thus making it appreciable in terms of an under- standing of those forces.'2 Order appreciation, however, stresses the nonintentional genesis of the object appreciated. In this sense any and all natural objects end up as more or less equally appreciable, because in order appreciation "there is only appreciating an object as ordered in light of a story."'3 Carlson recognizes that although such stories may appear in themselves to be non- aesthetic, they are ultimately exceedingly aes- thetic because "they illuminate nature as ordered and in doing so give it meaning, significance, and beauty-qualities those giving the stories find aesthetically appealing."14 Interestingly, Carlson draws on the language of art and human creativity to differentiate na-</page><page sequence="5">Foster The Narrative and the Ambient in Environmental Aesthetics 131 ture from that very creativity.'5 More to my point, he employs the metaphor of the story, the dramatic progression of events through time as relayed by a human narrator, to make his case for the primacy of science in the aesthetic ap- preciation of nature. It is not surprising that the story provided by natural science functions in the aesthetic appreciation of na- ture. ... Science is the paradigm of that which reveals objects for what they are and with the properties they have. Thus, it not only presents itself as the source of objective truth, it brands alternative accounts as subjective falsehood and therefore, in accord with objective appreciation, as irrelevant to aesthetic ap- preciation. 16 Carlson promotes the objective status of ap- preciative judgments made through order appre- ciation, but, by his own admission, science functions in this context as a story: the narrative stress of Carlson's approach is overtly apparent. The theoretical use of context to posit the nat- ural environment as an index of that context in- trigues me because I do not perceive that the nar- rative dimension of the scientific context (in its dependence on the formulation of a story) has been made entirely explicit. A story stands among the most human and subjective kinds of phenomena. Although Carlson clearly invokes the concept of "story" by analogy, stories in their most literal form function as acts of individual creation and not as processes of discovery. In seeking to ground aesthetic judgments objec- tively through the metaphor of the story, the nar- rative dimension of aesthetic value actually hints at the power of subjectivity from within its own form of discourse without confusing itself with or abandoning itself to subjectivity in the least. III The efficacy of any narrative approach to aes- thetic appreciation depends upon a particular form of semiotic interpretation. The American semiotician and logician Charles Sanders Peirce clarified the way signs function in his essay "Logic as Semiotic: The Theory of Signs." While a sign can also be an icon or a symbol, I call attention here to Peirce's identification of the index, that sign or representation which "refers to its object not so much because of any similarity or analogy with it, nor because it is as- sociated with general characters which that ob- ject happens to possess, as because it is in dy- namical (including spatial) connection both with the individual object, on the one hand, and with the senses of memory for the person for whom it serves as a sign, on the other hand."'7 Just as a cumulus cloud serves as an index of convective activity from earth to atmosphere, so too does a bright yellow color become an index of a maple tree's withholding nutrients from its leaves. The object we see-a cloud or a leaf-stands in causal relation both to processes we cannot see and to our recognition of these relations as hav- ing occurred before, as being present in our memories. The recognition of the natural envi- ronment as an index of processes hidden from the eye but intelligible to the mind characterizes what I have been elaborating as the narrative di- mension of aesthetic value. Whether we see nature as the place where pre- scientific human beings situated some forms of spiritual power, or as the legacy of long-aban- doned agrarian communities, or as the location of fascinatingly complex and seasonal cellular changes, we do in each case read the surface of the environment as a kind of story. We filter the perceptual properties of nature's surface through a frame of reference that functions as narrative in character, one that contextualizes the objects before us as players in a partially invisible drama. Making the narrative explicit reveals the surface objects as dramatic ossifications of pro- cesses we can no longer see, or are unable to see. The narrative dimension of aesthetic value privileges indexicality as a way of integrating conceptual understanding and perceptual en- counter, and in appreciating the environment in- dexically we add directly to our store of com- municable knowledge of the world. Still, while specific applications of the narrative dimension illuminate and inform discussions of values and the natural environment, they by no means ex- haust all possible standpoints on the topic. When the narrative dimension of aesthetic value eclipses almost entirely the functioning of the radically different, yet no less powerful form of appreciation I have called the ambient, we have an "indexical fallacy" in metacritical aesthetic theory. The indexical fallacy occurs not in the practice of narrative appreciation per se but in a collapsing of all aesthetic value to the narrative</page><page sequence="6">132 dimension, to the indexical expression of myth- ological, historical, or scientific processes through nature. In overemphasizing the indexical element of aesthetic appreciation, philosophers of the environment have allowed the narrative dimen- sion of value to occlude the ambient. The ambient dimension of aesthetic value emerges as an accompaniment to, rather than a replacement of, the narrative dimension, and rounds out the ways we might attribute aesthetic value to experiences of the natural environment. Too hearty an emphasis on the narrative dimen- sion of aesthetic value distracts us from a full acknowledgment of what we gain through knowl- edge by acquaintance in a more ambient, less in- dexical fashion. A fuller account of aesthetic value in the natural environment emerges when the knowledge furnished by both dimensions is examined in symbiotic relation. Consider how imagination makes a signifi- cant contribution to the narrative dimension of value. Emily Brady argues consistently and broadly for this point without allowing her own theory to fall neatly into either the narrative or the ambient dimensions of aesthetic apprecia- tion.18 The application of unseen concepts and facts to perceived natural environments involves the operation of imagination in order to make what is known amount to more than the contents of a textbook. Imagination makes the narrative dimension of aesthetic appreciation perceptu- ally operational: We "bring in" facts and theo- ries that we cannot see but that we understand, in appreciatively enlarging our perception of the environment. So too, nonetheless, does sensu- ous attentiveness to what appears before us be- come necessary to the operation of the narrative dimension. Imagination and sensuous attention, taken together, unveil an incipient otherness. Via imagination we bring what is not-present to the senses into sensuous relevance: We imag- ine and then can "see" the processes by which cumulus clouds form or leaves color and fall from a tree. Nonperceptual cognition animates the landscape, but in animation the breathing is done by us, in the fullness of sensuous en- counter. Imagination requires us to bring what is not-here, what is hidden, what is fact, into rela- tion with what is here, what is sensuously famil- iar, what we feel. Via the senses we can encounter that which stretches beyond textbook propositions into a The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism full knowledge by acquaintance. Abstraction on this count becomes felt: what we know about leaves from books can be fulfilled and in one sense superseded by what we know about them in sensuous contact. For example, when I am teaching my four-year-old niece Amanda about the trees near her house, I do not tell her much about the life of the maple tree at hand. Rather, I pluck a new spring leaf and run it along her cheek, so she can feel its pliable, infant softness. I hold that leaf up to high, midday sunlight, so she can admire its iridescence. I ask her to smell the lingering scent of the sap even in these new veins. When we return in autumn, the leaves show themselves differently. The no-longer pli- able maple leaf must be handled carefully to withstand our observation. Withered and curled, it no longer filters the sunlight but, its green all but gone, wears bright color of its own. The sap and its smell have dried up, though some new scent, a grave intimation of earthen autumn, can be caught near the stem. I do not tell her this, but let her feel it, let her gather in acquaintance the tactile dimensions of life. Narrative dimensions, while conducive to epistemological communication and perhaps even inspiring what we choose to look at and feel in the first place, sometimes overlook how we ponder the world as existentially embodied be- ings, as individuals in search of transmogrified fact. The pondering, I suggest, remains exceed- ingly important and as a form of value remains under-theorized and thus under-acknowledged as an enduring source of aesthetic knowledge. A clarification of this neglected, ambient dimen- sion provides more lucid access to the full range of potential aesthetic values in relation to the natural environment. IV By defending the existence of the ambient di- mension of aesthetic value I do not promote a reverie-laden foray into personal musing and whimsical observation. Neither does my label, however inadequate, refer to a way of communi- cating or writing about aesthetic experience, nor imply stasis and space where a narrative dimen- sion might connote movement and time. One of the problems with the ambient aesthetic is the difficulty in giving a succinct sense of it in words. Surely it connotes a feeling of being sur-</page><page sequence="7">Foster The Narrative and the Ambient in Environmental Aesthetics 133 rounded by or infused with an enveloping, en- gaging tactility, but the ambient in all its forms19 resists discursive formulation. As a way around, or into, this problem, I shall approach the ambient dimension of aesthetic value by in- direct comparison with what I have already out- lined as the narrative dimension of aesthetic value, as well as by briefly relating the observa- tions of a few philosophers in relation to it. In pursuing this line of reasoning I hope to pro- mote the integrity of the ambient dimension by demonstrating its persistence through time and divergent humanistic contexts. Within the narrative dimension of aesthetic value we can quite easily differentiate between competing narratives and can to some degree assess those narratives for factual or social ac- curacy. The ambient dimension of aesthetic value, however, does not rely in practice upon any standards, frameworks, or narratives exter- nal to the experiencing individual. While even the narrative dimension of aesthetic value can- not be reduced to propositional knowledge and goes beyond a merely communicative func- tion-Arnold Berleant demonstrates this effec- tively and at length in his theory of descriptive aesthetics20-it nevertheless retains explicit ties to bodies of knowledge and realms of thought beyond the individual's encounter with the sensuous surface of the environment. In the ambient dimension, if we do not wish to go so far as to claim that the individual loses himself or herself in aesthetic encounters with nature, then we can at least say that any refer- ences to external bodies of knowledge or thought remain implicit or in the background of con- sciousness. Ronald Hepburn gives expression to this in his article, "Landscape and The Meta- physical Imagination." He acknowledges the le- gitimacy of wonder in relation to aesthetic ex- periences of the natural environment while carefully distinguishing these experiences from their noetic, or overly anthropomorphic, coun- terparts.21 Recall that the narrative dimension of aesthetic value makes the dramatic background of the perceptual surface explicit. In the ambient dimension, the environment as an index of con- ceptual frameworks recedes and we encounter nature as an enveloping other, a place where the experience of one's self drifts drastically away from the factual everyday. As Berleant notes, "much, perhaps most, of our appreciative expe- rience of nature exceeds the limits of a contem- plative object and refuses to be constrained within discrete boundaries."22 The usual habit of cognitive separation into categories dissipates in the face of an open encounter with that which presents itself, at least on the surface, as radi- cally other from us. In foregoing epistemologi- cal control, we refrain, if only for a while, from boxing everything into neat cognitive packages. If we think of the narrative dimension of aes- thetic value as picking out and holding up for in- spection discrete objects, events, or groups of objects and events, as a sort of mental dissection of space through time, then the ambient dimen- sion of aesthetic value emerges when we resist such conscious epistemological organization and open ourselves to the immensity of what has been, most of the time and for many of us, else- where. The ambient dimension, while not easily discussed, reverberates in the philosophical rec- ognition of it as a sensibility. Jane Howarth ex- plores this from the standpoint of phenomenol- ogy in her recent article "Nature's Moods,"23 and Gaston Bachelard pays tribute to it in his classic reflection, The Poetics of Space. Immen- sity, Bachelard reflects, takes shape in the philosophical category of daydream, where day- dream contemplates grandeur in the presentation of natural forms and processes. In point of fact, daydreaming, from the very first sec- ond, is an entirely constituted state. We do not see it start, and yet it always starts the same way, that is, it flees the object nearby and right away it is far off, elsewhere, in the space of elsewhere. When this elsewhere is in natural surroundings, that is, when it is not lodged in the houses of the past, it is immense. And one might say that daydream is origi- nal contemplation.24 John Dewey, coming out of a radically different philosophical tradition, also recognizes and at- tempts to articulate a similar phenomenon, which he locates in the experience of art as well as of nature. In the aesthetic experience, says Dewey, there is "that sense of an enveloping undefined whole that accompanies every normal experi- ence. This whole is then felt as an expansion of ourselves. ... Where egotism is not made the measure of reality and value, we are citizens of this vast world beyond ourselves, and any in- tense realization of its presence with and in us</page><page sequence="8">134 brings a peculiarly satisfying sense of unity in itself and with ourselves."125 Arthur Schopenhauer posits an entirely dif- ferent thinking subject when aesthetic con- sciousness takes hold. In speaking of mountain- ously tempestuous seas, of roaring streams that make us shout to be heard, of steep cliffs, Schopenhauer uses the moment of sublime en- counter to promote the ambient dimension of aesthetic value. Then in the unmoved beholder of this scene the two- fold nature of his consciousness reaches the highest distinctness. Simultaneously, he feels himself as indi- vidual, as the feeble phenomenon of will, which the slightest touch of these forces can annihilate ... and he also feels himself as the eternal, serene subject of knowing, who as the condition of every object is the supporter of this whole world, the fearful struggle of na- ture being only his mental picture or representation.26 Aesthetic engagement,27 for Schopenhauer, Dewey, Bachelard, and Howarth, has some- thing to do with an intimacy between the human individual's mode of representing the world to itself and the serene contemplation of that rep- resentation. Such a representation draws on the sensuous as well as the cognitive self, and thus a potent source of value in the ambient dimension of aesthetic appreciation of nature might be the ways in which, our encounters with the natural environment redirect us from the need to the- orize the world overtly and instead encourage us to experience it in a more diffuse and unified manner. Despite its resistance to compact or categori- cal objectivity, the ambient dimension of aes- thetic consciousness has always and continues to find a place in the homage of thinkers in our tradition. Stephen Bourassa pays ample atten- tion to something like this in his exhaustive ac- count The Aesthetics of Landscape.28 Thinkers such as Pauline von Bonsdorff, Neil Evernden, Galen Johnson, Barbara Sandrisser, Yi-Fu Tuan,29 and the previously mentioned Berleant, Hepburn, and Howarth also address it in a great variety of places and ways. Their homage re- flects neither the detritus of a fey religiosity nor the vacuousness of an intellectually vapid new age, but instead grows sturdily out of clear ob- servations about the practices of persons within our culture. The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism The aesthetic impact of the natural environ- ment, for many of us, does not always or even primarily derive from the conscious application of narratives to what we see and understand. Rather, we also value the departure from the self-conscious, controlled, specificity-directed application of concepts to sense, and instead sometimes seek to encounter nature in a more moodful, multisensuous way. A kind of reflec- tiveness persists in such an experience, where we refrain from giving frameworks to or deriv- ing them from the environment, but instead allow more subtle impressions to dominate us. The textures of earth as we move over them, the sounds of the winds and the wildlife and trees, the moistness or dryness of the air, the nascent colors or seasonal mutations-all can melt into a synthesized backdrop for ambient contempla- tion of both the backdrop itself and the sensuous way we relate to it. Such experiences have al- ways been and remain distinctly aesthetic30 and, as aesthetic, constitute a form of knowing both oneself and the world anew. The natural environment has been widely acknowledged within our culture as a source of powerful aesthetic experiences. In order to deepen the social commitment to preserving that environment, it is always wise to attempt to persuade people with facts about the future of the planet, with pictures of devastation and pro- jections for incipient calamity. Yet it is wise as well to educate people through acquaintance, to make and keep natural environments accessible to individuals so that they might experience the ambient dimension of aesthetic appreciation as perhaps a first and ultimately lasting point of value in their attitudes toward the natural world. The ambient dimension of aesthetic value can act as a catalyst for the inculcation of a sensibil- ity toward the environment: ecological, politi- cal, economic, or recreational kinds of concern often grow out of this more isolated and yet fun- damental kind of environmental experience. Di- rect experience, however, does not always give itself fully to direct communication. As the American philosopher Susanne Langer has observed, "there is ... an important part of reality that is quite inaccessible to the formative influence of language; that is the so-called realm of 'inner-experience,' the life of feeling and emotion ... the form of language does not reflect the natural form of feeling, so that we cannot</page><page sequence="9">Foster The Narrative and the Ambient in Environmental Aesthetics 135 shape any extensive concepts of feeling with the help of ordinary discursive language."3' Many of the examples I have cited manifest what I term the asymptotic character of the ambient di- mension of aesthetic value. The asymptote, as we know from algebra and analytic geometry, characterizes the sort of mathematical function which, while moving closer to the x or y axis as its variables are plotted, never actually reaches either axis, even as it moves toward infinity. The ambient dimension of aesthetic value has this character. It points at or evokes a sense of the in- finite, of wonder, of that which exceeds our grasp, yet struggles ever more closely toward ar- ticulation or plotting along the axis of human communication. At once anchored and renegade, the depth experienced in the ambient dimension of aesthetic value resists straightforward prose. Any success at drawing the asymptote closer to the concrete axis of clear understanding, even as it bounds away to infinity, is achieved by imag- inative association between one set of experi- ences and another. And for lasting imaginative achievement, we look to poetry and the other arts. As a translation mechanism, art finds a way of articulating where articulation does not occur with ease. The form of nature has no words. We bring words to it, but the words and sensibilities of the poet, the artist, are not the explanations of the straightforward, linear narrative. Indeed, si- lence remains more crucial to the ambient aes- thetic than words. Of course, we require words, pictures, stories to make what we value about the natural environment clear to others. But to experience that value for ourselves in a ambient fashion, we need something of humility and si- lence; the recognition that what there is to know always exceeds our power to know it. Art offers one way of dwelling on this idea; nature walks offer another, and still, the two are intimately re- lated in the silence of perceptual apprehension. In the realm of good arguments, though, our silence threatens to slow down our progress. Yet, how can one argue for the value of that which sometimes eludes direct articulation? If the am- bient dimension of aesthetic value not only re- quires for its emergence a silencing of the epis- temological impulse but also expresses itself best in asymptotical forms of communication like art and poetry, how can we possibly make a case for that dimension as a powerful and worth- while consideration in our dialogue about values and the natural environment? V I have no easy or immediate solution to this dif- ficulty. Surely any solution necessitates not only a willingness to enlarge the field of empirical data we normally consider as stable evidence in any judgment about value, but also an openness to the possibility that our present emphasis on mostly narrative dimensions of aesthetic value, even the scientific ones, are more anthropomor- phic than their champions seem to believe they are. Although he defers to science in revealing the depth of time beneath the aesthetic surface of nature, Holmes Rolston recognizes the inabil- ity of the narrative dimension alone to provide anything like a full account of aesthetic value. "Landscape as phenomena is difficult to dismiss as mere phenomena, because the full story of natural history is too phenomenal, too spectacu- lar, to be mere landscape; it is a sacrament of something noumenal. Sensitive encounter with landscape discloses dimensions of depth."32 Of course, reducing all aesthetic appreciation of the environment to the ambient dimension of value would be prejudiced and misguided, and I hope I have not promoted anything like this in my discussion. Yet, reducing all aesthetic appre- ciation of the environment to the narrative di- mension of value errs as well, in the direction of distilling away from experience only that which fits a highly specific and scholarly mode, the mode of discursive, idealized expression and analysis. Paradoxically, the realization of otherness in our encounter with nature occurs from our standpoint as subjective, particularly embodied individuals: the feel of the not-Self emerges in a form of awareness traditionally associated with the Self, an existential awareness. It inculcates a sensibility and promotes an attitude of wonder and humility with regard to the complex pro- cesses of the natural world, a world that simply cannot be exhausted in our attempts to define and confine it, even as those attempts have be- come more codified and stable with the advent of scientific method. As philosophers, we are confined to the nar- rative in making a case for the nonnarrative. I have here attempted to draw attention to the am-</page><page sequence="10">136 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism bient dimension of aesthetic value in a round- about, almost sidelong, way, and yet I have re- mained firmly within the tradition of arguing from example, analogy, correlation, and cause. This does not erase ambient dimensions from the spectrum of important factors within value, however, and it is up to us to widen our frame of reference to include these, rather than to exclude them from the reach of our propositions. Just as the narrative approach implies a semiotic of in- dexicality, the ambient approach conjures the curve of the asymptote, the function whose tra- jectory at once eludes perfect correspondence and yet points out to infinity. The resistance of ambient aesthetic dimen- sions to direct articulation poses difficulties for practical decisions concerning values and the natural environment. However, these are not in- surmountable difficulties, should we be willing to face the complexity and richness of aesthetic value head-on and adjust our methods of ac- counting for it accordingly. Alluding to the value of a muted, ambient aesthetic is not im- possible when that approach is both differenti- ated from a narrative aesthetic and understood to be flourishing within and alongside it. Diffi- culty of communication neither destabilizes nor erases the validity of existential awareness em- erging from aesthetic engagement with natural environments. It is a challenge to the philoso- pher, nevertheless, to make the case for its legit- imacy as a form of aesthetic value without com- promising either its alienation from, or debt to, more discursive modes of expression that might lend themselves usefully to the defense of ob- jective judgments.33 CHERYL FOSTER Department of Philosophy University of Rhode Island Adams Hall Butterfield Road Kingston, Rhode Island 02881-0813 INTERNET: CHERYLF@URIACC.URI.EDU 1.

It is nevertheless my observation that many of the most influential and current theories do in- deed fall on one side of the cleft or the other, and so in this sense I call attention to the significance of the split as well as to the divergent content of the dichotomous theories themselves. 3.

The ambient bears a close relationship to but may be distinguished from the meditative consciousness, where an individual contemplates the world in a receptive rather than a proactive manner. Ambiance connotes a sense of environ- ment, of being surrounded, while the meditative perhaps im- plies a distancing of oneself from that which is contem- plated. I thank Arnold Berleant for making the importance of this distinction apparent during a conversation at 'Aes- thetics of the Forest: The Second International Conference of Environmental Aesthetics" at Punkaharju, Finland, June 1996.</page><page sequence="11">Foster The Narrative and the Ambient in Environmental Aesthetics 137 20.

The term engagement as invoked in this context is more general and less precise than the concept of "engage- ment" identified and developed by Arnold Berleant in his book Art and Engagement (Temple University Press, 1991), though its use in relation to the thinkers cited here does ac- knowledge their debt to a philosophical tradition that takes seriously some of the same aesthetic values explored by Berleant as well. 28.

Although the term "aesthetic" can be interpreted in a variety of ways, I use it in the general sense of involving con- scious and imaginative attention to sensuously evoked as- pects of the world. Even literature imaginatively harnesses the sensuous in the conjuring of its own ontology, its own functionally construed universe of things, people, and places. 31.
