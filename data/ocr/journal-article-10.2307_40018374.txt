Printed in the Netherlands. I In William Wainwright's collection, God, Philosophy and the Academic Culture1 the participants discuss a perceived distance between philosophers of religion whose main allegiance is to the American Philosophical Asso- ciation (APA) and philosophers of religion whose main allegiance is to the American Academy of Religion (AAR). The descriptions the groups give of themselves and each other are philosophically interesting, since both reveal more than they realise. Before we begin to discuss the philosophical differences between the groups, certain attitudes on the part of the APA group are best set aside at the outset. It is obvious that some of them think that the APA group are better philosophers than their AAR colleagues; that their technical argumentation is too difficult for many AAR philosophers to grasp; that rather than make an effort to understand these technicalities, AAR philosophers prefer to indulge in the exotic, but logically loose ways of Continental thought. There is no warrant for these philosophical opinions. No doubt one may have a low opinion of certain trends in Continental thought, but one may have an equally low opinion of certain trends in analytic thought. This simply illustrates the intellectual uselessness of external assessments of this kind. The remarks are also morally and religiously unfortunate, since they seem to be an intellectually arrogant form of, 'Lord, we thank thee that we are not as other philosophers are'. This scene is best forgotten. The discussions between the APA and AAR groups also mention polit- ical, historical and sociological reasons for the differences between them. Although these reasons are not, themselves, philosophical, it can be shown that philosophical questions grow out of them. For this reason, they are worth mentioning. The democratic constitution of the USA is linked to political liberalism. It claims to be able to offer its citizens a public discourse in which they are equal participants. Discussion is conducted, it is claimed, within a common</page><page sequence="2">130 D.Z.PHILLIPS conception of reason and experience. Unsurprisingly, there is no place for sectarian views in such a context. In relation to religion in the Academy, this means that it can be discussed, but not espoused in the name of intellectual enquiry. Further, since democratic rights extend to religious affiliations, the recognition of a plurality of religious affiliations, the recognition of a plurality of religions, is inevitable within state academic institutions. As Nicholas Wolterstorff says: 'Catholics began saying that the academy appeared to them Protestant; Jews began saying that the academy appeared to them Christian; adherents of Eastern religions began saying that the academy appeared to them theist; and atheists began saying that the academy appeared to them religious' (p. 16). Religious commitments can be voiced in private religious academic institutions, but, since they want to enjoy the same academic status as their secular neighbours, inevitably, they too tend to adopt the same liberal, democratic ethos. It takes a brave voice indeed, it is said, to question the assumptions on which a common public discourse and its conception of a common reason and experience are said to depend. Philosophers of religion in the APA are said to be unhappy about this general situation, while their AAR colleagues are said to be happy to work within it. Why should this be so? One reason offered by APA philosophers is that, unlike their AAR colleagues, they have a robust concept of truth. Philip Quinn says that analytic philosophers believe that truth and falsity can be determined in a principled fashion. Does 'in a principled fashion' mean 'philosophi- cally'? If not, how would 'having a robust conception of truth' indicate any philosophical difference between the two groups? When not philosophising, I suppose members of the APA and AAR groups have robust conceptions of truth. I put the manner in the plural because what such conceptions amount to will vary with the context in question. When someone asks them where they live, they usually give replies which are true. I mean that they tell the truth about the name or number of the house, the name of the street or the city. I may ask someone whether a lecture room is available. He peeps inside and tells me, truly, 'It's occupied'. I ask my wife whether my son is serious about marrying his fiancee, and she replies, truthfully, 'He is'. Jesus asks Peter, 'Who do people say that I am?' and he is able to tell him the truth about these matters. Jesus also asks Peter, 'Who do you say that I am?' When Peter replies, 'You are the Christ, Son of the living God', he takes himself to be telling the truth. I am assuming that the examples I have given will be equally familiar to APA and AAR philosophers of religion alike. In a practical sense, therefore, analytic philosophy is not specially related to these determinations of truth and falsity. A conviction that philosophy claims otherwise is one of the familiar reasons for the abandonment of intro-</page><page sequence="3">RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY, AND THE ACADEMY 131 ductory courses in philosophy. The student says: 'I don't need philosophy to tell me whether there is a chair in the room'. Perhaps analytic philosophers will say that the student is simply 'thinking with the vulgar'. If so, they are attributing the wrong kind of sophistication to philosophy. Philosophy is not a more sophisticated practical understanding of the fact that there is a chair in the room. Does this mean, then, that philosophy is not concerned with truth and falsity? Not at all: it is concerned with the concepts of truth and falsity. Philosophers can be deeply puzzled about what they come to, and even be sceptical about their possibility. For example, they have denied that we can ever be certain of the truth of an empirical proposition. They cannot be pre- vented from thinking like this simply by reminding them of examples such as those I have mentioned. They are as aware of them as I am. What needs to be brought out is how such examples tempt us to embrace philosophical theories which fail to do justice to the actual application concepts have in our lives. Unless we uncover the routes to conceptual confusion, there is no road back to clarity. Philosophical discussions, therefore, are conceptual discussions. That is why it is more natural to speak of philosophy investigating the reality, rather than the existence, of physical objects. We cannot investigate that reality in the ways we investigate whether a particular physical object exists. In the latter context, the intelligibility of discourse about physical objects is taken for granted. But when that very discourse is called into question, we are raising the issue of whether it makes sense at all to speak in this way. Strictly speaking, should we not speak of sense data? Aren't physical objects logical constructs from sense data? Scepticism, at its deepest, always questions the very possibility of discourse. These philosophical issues are as old as philosophy itself. They concerned Parmenides. Plato came to see that the difference between philosophical enquiry and empirical enquiry, no matter how general, is not a difference in degree, but a difference in kind. There is a tendency among analytic philoso- phers of religion, however, to treat philosophical investigation as though it were a very general form of empirical investigation. When analytic philosophers of religion say that they have a robust con- ception of truth, others think that their conception is, in fact, extremely simplistic. They are often heard to say, as though the matter had a self- evident luminosity, that 'p is true, if and only if p'. The proposition 'Jesus was an apprentice carpenter' is true if and only if Jesus was an apprentice carpenter. The proposition 'Jesus is the Son of God is true' if and only if Jesus is the Son of God. When Peter confessed that Jesus was the Christ, Son of the living God, he is told by Jesus, 'Flesh and blood did not reveal</page><page sequence="4">132 D.Z.PHILLIPS this to you', whereas that is precisely what informed him about what others thought of Jesus. But I suspect that most analytic philosophers of religion would say that although there are different ways of determining the truth of propositions, this is no way affects the notions of truth and factuality involved. What this ignores is that the surroundings, the contexts in which these matters have their life, are internally related to what factuality and truth come to. The analytic philosophers often sublime a conception of logic in a futile attempt to transcend all the grammatically varied concepts of our discourse. If this is appreciated, we see that 'the luminous philosophical insight' turns out to be an extremely simple-minded notion of factuality, of 'how things are', almost as though one could simply point and say, 'These are the facts'. The surface grammar of our utterances may tempt us in this direction. We can say, in all sorts of contexts. 'It is a fact that . . . ', where what we mean is, 'It is true that . . . '. But, of course, this does not mean that the logic of our remarks, in all these cases, is akin to assertions concerning empirical facts. Further, the notion of 'the empirical', itself, is far more complex than one might imagine. For example, a broad distinction between the mathematical and the empirical is too crude in many instances, as Wittgenstein has shown. Mathematics, sometimes, enters into the determination of what the facts are, as when we ask how many vibrations there are in a sound. It is only in the marriage between geometry and optics that the principle of the rectilinear propagation of light has its sense. In short, our notions of 'factuality' are not simply given. Analytic philosophers of religion say, in all sorts of contexts, 'But is there not the fact of the matter?' Indeed, there is, but the grammar of 'fact of the matter' is varied, even within the perceptual realm itself. One need only look at Wittgenstein's discussions in his Philosophical Investigations llxi to appreciate the complexities involved. In his presidential address to the Central Division of the APA on 'belief, Peter Winch brings out how these discussions move 'from considerations of different kinds of perceptual - mainly visual - examples of change of aspect, through consideration of sensitivity to aesthetic distinctions and ability to respond to fine shades in the meaning of a word, to ability to fathom the souls of other people. Throughout these discussions the emphasis is on the indeterminateness of what may be considered as relevant to the making of judgements in these areas and on the other hand the importance of such judgements'.2 When many analytic philosophers of religion refer to the history of twentieth-century philosophy of religion, they tend to speak as though logical positivism was dominant in mid-century, and that the most dramatic philo- sophical change was between it and the modes of argumentation which are dominant in contemporary analytic philosophy of religion. This is described</page><page sequence="5">RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY, AND THE ACADEMY 133 as the resurrection of the subject from its assumed death as the result of a thousand qualifications and charges of meaninglessness. But this account is historically inaccurate, resulting from the curious neglect of Wittgenstein, not only in the philosophisings of philosophers who call themselves 'analytic', but in the account they give of the subject. Even the most cursory reading of his work should show how devastating a critique of positivism it contains, and of its ambitions to give an account of 'pure seeing' in physicalist terms. The fatal assumption which stands in the way of appreciation of these dis- tinctions is that clarity entails cut-and-dried criteria by which judgements concerning truth and falsity are made. Whereas Wittgenstein is insisting that clarity involves the recognition of indeterminateness. This is not to claim, as some analytic philosophers might, that we are settling for fuzzy concepts where clearer ones would be an advantage. If the concepts were other than they are they could not have the role or the importance they have in our lives. If 'Jesus is the Son of God' were on the same grammatical level as 'Jesus is an apprentice carpenter' it would not have the importance it has, either for a Peter who confesses it or for a Nietzsche who denies it. To tell Jesus what others think of him, Peter simply has to make a statement. To tell Jesus what he thinks of him, Peter has to make a confession. It is futile to say that the surroundings are unimportant unless a believer first believed that Jesus is the Son of God, since it is these very surroundings which show, in the first place, what 'belief amounts to in this context. In not paying attention to these surroundings, the 'tough' analyses of analytic philosophers are actually not tough enough. I suspect that this is one of the sources of discontent with analytic philoso- phers voiced by the AAR philosophers. They suspect that the technical argumentation of their colleagues hides the paucity of the religious episte- mology which underlies it. They find their analyses to be of little religious significance. This is partly because the influence of our language concerning empirical objects exercises a mesmeric hold on many analytic philosophers. They seek approximations to the kind of independent reality found in the reality of physical objects in contexts where it simply does not apply. Of course, if asked, APA philosophers would deny thinking of God as though he were an empirical object, but their AAR colleagues suspect that they simply make God's reality an invisible object without any fundamental change in grammar. Given the anthropomorphism rampant in contemporary analytic philosophy of religion, it is not surprising that God becomes 'the Invisible Man' of theology. In the famous films of the Invisible Man, he appeared, occasionally. In other words, the Invisible Man became visible. But when we are told that the Israelites travelled out of Egypt as people who had seen the invisible, it is not</page><page sequence="6">134 D.Z.PHILLIPS implied that this invisible had become visible. Rather, they travelled in the spirit, possessed by spiritual realities. God is Spirit, and to have God in one is to be possessed of this spirit. Finding God is coming to this spirit. There is an urgent need in the philosophy of religion for conceptual elucidation of the concept of 'spirit', neglected for too long, perhaps as a result of what Hegel did with it. How does it come about that religious belief becomes severed from the surroundings in which it has its sense? We can answer this by seeing how this can happen, philosophically, to the notion of belief more generally. Analytic philosophers of religion often speak of belief as a mental occurrence or dis- position. To discover belief, to understand it, would then be to pay attention to this mental phenomenon. Wittgenstein questions this misleading picture: 'How did we ever come to use such an expression as "I believe . . . "? Did we at some time become aware of a phenomenon (of belief)? Did we observe ourselves and other people and so discover belief?'3 In relation to others, we may think his word, 'I believe . . . ' is a reflection or expression of the mental phenomenon occurring as the words are uttered. But is this how we understand his words? Wittgenstein shows that it is not by imagining the words severed from the actual application they have. 'Imagine an observer who, as it were automatically, says what he is observing. Of course he hears himself talk, but, so to speak, he takes no notice of that. He sees that the enemy is approaching and reports it, describes it, but like a machine. What would that be like? Well, he does not act according to his observation. Of him, one might say that he speaks what he sees, but that he does not believe it. It does not, so to speak, get inside him.'4 Here, Wittgenstein is rescuing 'belief and 'getting inside a person' from mentalistic, metaphysical distortion. 'To get inside a person', to see 'what his beliefs come to', is not to examine some mental occurrence, or the func- tioning of cognitive faculties (the old empiricist assumption), but to see what they are in his life. And this is so from the simplest to the most complex cases. And what of one's own beliefs? How are these to be understood? Wittgen- stein presents the picture which may mislead us: 'What about my own case: how do I myself recognize my own disposition? - Here it will have been necessary for me to take notice of myself as others do, to listen to myself talking to be able to draw conclusions from what I say!'5 And things are no different if the 'talking' is an internal dialogue. Do I believe it is going to rain, examine this belief as a mental phenomenon, believe it is reliable, and therefore decide to take an umbrella? Wittgenstein says that this is like saying, 'I believe because I believe'. And, of course, if the belief that my initial belief is reliable is itself a mental phenomenon, I shall have to believe it is reliable, and so on ad infinitum. This is the logical</page><page sequence="7">RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY, AND THE ACADEMY 1 35 result of views of belief which cuts it off from the surroundings in which it has its sense. If the picture of belief and thinking as a mental phenomenon of the kind I have been criticising is maintained, then, as Wittgenstein says: 'If God had looked into our minds he would not have been able to see there whom we were speaking of.'6 It is interesting here to see Wittgenstein attacking, not simply the intellec- tualist distortion of 'belief, but the equally intellectualist distortion of 'God looking into our minds'. Both are severed from their natural contexts by the misleading philosophical analysis. At this point, I want to quote at length Winch's contrast of the simplistic picture of 'God looking into our minds', and Wittgenstein's exposure of it, with the religious significance this notion can have: " 'That last famous remark (of Wittgenstein's) reminds me of a line given to Sir Thomas More in the film A Man For All Seasons. More, on becoming Lord Chancellor to Henry VIII, has refused to give any polit- ical office to one of his hangers-on, Richard Rich (whom, with all too much justification, he does not trust) and recommends him to become a teacher. Rich protests disgustedly that even if one is a good teacher no one will know, so what's the point? More's response (roughly): 'Well, you would know; your students would know; and God would know. That's not a bad audience.' My question is, what is added in that reply by the reference to God. There is a picture there of course of an all-knowing observer. The picture might even be painted - with God looking down from Heaven with an expression of approval at Rich before his responsive students. However, the question Wittgenstein is always asking is, How is such a picture applied? More's God - the 'God of religion' - is very different from the 'God of the philosophers' towards whom Wittgenstein is ironically gesturing in my last quotation from him. Spelling out the application of the picture would take a long time and take us through territory not all of which could be foreseen in advance. It would depend on what religious difficulties, disagreements and obscurities would have to be dealt with by the interlocutors. But certainly, so it seems to me, discussion of the role that God's 'all seeing' plays in the life of a believer, and in his or her attitude to that life, would have to play a prominent part. And issues would arise about which there would almost certainly be considerable, and often perhaps unsolvable dispute - For instance confessional dif- ferences concerning the sacrament of confession might well be relevant - The complex, uncertain and murky background suggested here is in sharp contrast to the simple philosophical picture Wittgenstein is com- batting with his remark, 'If God had looked into our minds he would not</page><page sequence="8">136 D.Z.PHILLIPS have been able to see there whom we were speaking of - suggesting as it does that what gives sense to the obscurities of human discourse is a quite determinate and unambiguous state of affairs ('fact of the matter'). That the background of issues from which More's (apocryphal) remark draws its sense is in this way indeterminate and not always resolvable does not detract from the remark's importance - On the contrary! It brings out how much in human discourse, is rooted in the very uncertain ground of mutual understanding between human beings, a theme which dominates the last few pages of Uix. We may be inclined to think that the quasi-aesthetic sensitivity to 'fine shades of meaning' is a luxury we must dispense with if we want to get at the hard facts. It was in that spirit that a well-known Austrian philosopher (as I once heard) used to refer disparagingly to members of his university's English department as 'the truth and beauty girls'. But, as Wittgenstein remarked of a similar inclination in a very slightly different connection: 'Call it a dream. It does not change anything' ".78 Sometimes, the APA group sound like people out to settle 'the hard facts', looking at their AAR colleagues as 'dream merchants', with the latter replying, 'Call us what you like, it won't change anything'. Ironically, a so- called search for 'hard facts' can lead us away from 'the God of religion' to 'the God of the philosophers' Wittgenstein attacked. Look what happens to the God for whom all hearts are open and no secrets are hid in the Blackwell Companion to Philosophy of Religion: he becomes the knower of an infinite number of inert propositions: 'Most theologians who accept the doctrine of the omniscience of God would probably not think themselves committed to the claim that God - a non-embodied being - has the neuromuscular skill of riding a bicycle . . . They would think that God knows every fact there is to know about bicycle riding ... all the truths about those subjects . . . The doctrine of the divine omniscience, that is, is a doctrine about "knowledge that", a doctrine about propositional knowledge.'9 Is it? Has this view anything to do with religion at all, with its picture of billions of true propositions in the divine mind? Surely this is an example of uprooting a religious concept from the natural religious concept in which it has its sense. It would be like thinking that when it is said that, with God, the hairs of our heads are numbered, this would mean that there is a number corresponding to each head in the divine mind. I would expect the AAR philosophers to see the joke in this suggestion, but I am not at all confident that this would be true of their APA counterparts. Their respect for 'hard facts' thus leads, sometimes, to comic fantasies.</page><page sequence="9">RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY, AND THE ACADEMY 1 37 II Hitherto, my comments have been critical of certain modes of argumentation which are pervasive among APA philosophers of religion. This may have given the impression that all is well with the philosophical perspectives often associated with the AAR philosophers of religion. This is far from being the case. These philosophers pride themselves on having learned the lessons of Kant's attack on metaphysics, and accuse their APA colleagues of being stubbornly pre-Kantian. What is Kant held to have taught us? On the interpretation of Kant relevant to the differences between the APA and AAR groups we are discussing, Kant showed us the futility of seeking knowledge outside human consciousness. That consciousness is characterised by categories within which, of necessity, we arrive at the things we know. Thus, according to Kant, there is a dualism between the categories of human consciousness and how things really are. The former is the world of appearance to which we are confined, whereas the latter is ontologically forever beyond our grasp. If we accept this account of our situation, what is the status of the forms of knowledge available to us? According to the AAR philosophers what we possess is an interpretation of reality. Wolterstorff describes the situation as follows: 'Reality is never anywhere present in us - not even in our present mental reality. In experience, representation is all, in inner sense as well as outer. But not representation as the pre-Kantians understood it, as images; but representation as Kant understood it, as always-ready-conceptualized experience-stuff - for which a better model than reflective images is repre- sentational paintings. To peel away the interpretation from the interpreted experience would not be to get at the pure given but to lose the only given we have - the interpreted given. Prisoners, all of us, within the house of interpretation.' 10 The inevitable result, according to APA philosophers is rela- tivism, by which they seem to mean that 'things are as they are' only within a conceptual scheme. Wolterstorff calls this view, interpretation-universalism, and objects to it as follows: 'Why suppose that beyond our shot-through- with-interpretation experience there is a ready-made structured world, hanging around, waiting for us to interpret it? Is the supposition even intelligible? Any attempt to think such a world will already be an interpretation of it, a conceptualizing of it. Better to conclude that things exist, and are as they are, only relative to one or another of our conceptual schemes. Of course there's more than our conceptual schemes. But that more - unless one is speaking within some conceptual scheme - is just primeval Ur-stuff whose only character as such is susceptibility to interpretations - for to think of it as susceptible to interpre- tations is also to interpret it. Formless chaos, whose only character as such</page><page sequence="10">138 D.Z.PHILLIPS is susceptibility to the imposition of form. And it doesn't even come ready- made bearing the property of susceptibility to the imposition of form - for to think of it as susceptible to the imposition of form is to interpret it as having that much form. Hard to think!'11 It can be seen from the overall situation that there is no independent check on any interpretation; we are not in a position to say whether an interpretation is correct or not. AAR philosophers suggest that, as a result, the only intel- lectual option is tolerance for all interpretations. Thus there is an internal link between interpretation-universalism and relativism. If we keep in mind the Wittgensteinian insights of the first part of the paper, we can see that the AAR position is simply the flip side of the same metaphysical coin in which the APA analytic philosophers of religion trade. The AAR philosophers speak of everything as interpretation because they think that if one is to speak of reality, it ought to be the unmediated con- cept of reality the emptiness of which is exposed by Wittgenstein. The APA philosophers think, rightly, that to speak of everything as interpretation is to leave the door wide open to scepticism. What the APA philosophers do not see is that their critique of classical foundationalism leaves them no better off. Evidentialists, those who argue that disputes between believers and unbelievers can be settled by an appeal to common evidence, admit that all they can conclude is that the probabilities are on the side of belief. Let us put aside formidable objections to the use of probability-assessments in these contexts. Even then, such a view robs us of certainties in human life and puts probabilities in their place. But are eviden- tialism's critics any better off? Whether they replace 'conceptual schemes' with ungrounded perspectival particularism (Wolterstorff's choice), noetic structures (Plantinga's choice) or doxastic practices (Alston's choice), they all admit that there is a real possibility that 'things as they are' may be quite different from what these perspectives, structures, or practices suggest. But, of course, just as Wolterstorff appealed to the fact that there are many con- ceptual schemes, in his criticisms of post-Kantianism, so he has to admit that there are many perspectives, structures or practices. We may believe that they tell us how things are, but we can never know. There is no way of deciding the issue between competing perspectives. Wolterstorff says: 'It's not at all unusual nowadays for philosophers who call themselves "physicalists" to unabashedly begin a paper by announcing that they wish to explore one or another aspect of physicalism - without on that occasion or any other making a pretence of establishing that physicalism is more probable than not on the available evidence of certitudes. And likewise, it is becoming less and less unusual for philosophers, who regard themselves as theists of one form or another to act similarly. The physicalist assumes that he is not irrational in</page><page sequence="11">RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY, AND THE ACADEMY 1 39 being a physicalist; the theist, that he is not irrational in being a theist.'12 But this argument thinks we must be content with beliefs because, like those who say that we must be content with interpretations, certainty is thought to depend on something unavailable to us, a grounded conception of reality. Wittgenstein, by contrast, in seeking clarity about the role concepts play in our lives, directs our attention to what we actually do, our perceptions of physical objects, including their changes of aspect, our experiences of sensa- tions and emotions, the ways in which we calculate, the ways we make moral and political judgements, the ways we pray, and so on, and so on. These are not conceptual schemes, perspectives, structures, or interpretations, all involving a metaphysical dualism about 'how we think' and 'the ways things are'. Instead, they are contexts in which various distinctions between the real and the unreal have their life. Wittgenstein endeavours to give perspic- uous representations of these contexts. Part of this involves becoming clear about the grammar of the concepts involved. Thus, Robert Adams is wrong in thinking that this emphasis in Wittgenstein is anti-realist or a matter of making interpretation the ultimate form of experience.13 This ignores the fact that what Wittgenstein says we want is realism without empiricism, and that, at certain points, we are not talking about interpretations at all. Sometimes, we are not interpreting something as seeing a tree, but seeing a tree. We are not interpreting something as pain, but having a pain. We are not interpreting something as counting, but counting. And what of praying? Are we in touch with the divine or not? Here, there are differences. In certain areas of life, the agreement which shows itself in the ways we act means that those who do not share that agreement are cut off from that form of human life. The blind have a real loss. The colour- blind share that description of themselves, as do the deaf. Those who cannot follow the rules of arithmetic are cut off from counting and all the many ways it enters our lives. These are not conceptual schemes, interpretations, or systems of beliefs, but realities in human life. In the Wittgensteinian tradition there are diverse reactions to sceptical attempts to deny these realities. One is to remind the sceptic, 'But this is what we call counting, pain, or red'. The sceptic is reminded not of second-best interpretations or beliefs, but of what is constitutive of realities in these various contexts. Another reaction puts this emphasis in a different way. If we really tried to imagine someone cut off from these realities, it would be little use saying, 'But this is what we call . . . ', because that 'reminder' would be totally ineffective against someone in that state. This is sometimes coupled with the view that although a philoso- pher may say he or she is simply confined in this life to interpretations or beliefs about a reality which could be quite other than we think, that claim is itself a denial of the human life he or she leads. This can be shown by the</page><page sequence="12">140 D. Z. PHILLIPS fact that if they were really cut off from reality what they would need is not correction, but treatment. Thus, the philosophers contention that reality could be different from what we take it to be is often idle, but not foolishly so, since deep temptations have lead to this conclusion. But there are other matters, moral, political, aesthetic and religious where agreement, typically, does not share a common form. And those cut off from some of these agreements in judgement are participants in others. Is there no truth concerned in such matters? Certainly, there is, but its grammar is not the same as truth in mathematics or the truth of a hypothesis in physics. In moral, political, aesthetic and religious contexts, 'coming to the truth' is a different matter. A person has to come to the truth for himself or herself. The search for truth is carried on within certain broad parameters, but they are broad, and there is a wide variety within them. In religion, 'the coming to the truth' is a matter of confession, a spiritual arrival. We cannot say 'This is the truth' without that being a confession; or, at least, if we did, it is called hypocrisy or a sin. If we realise this, we can see why philosophy itself cannot determine matters of truth and falsity in these contexts. To think otherwise is itself to corrupt the notions of truth involved. It is not a case of analytical philos- ophy being better suited to the task, as Merold Westphal supposes. There is a misconception in the conception of the task. William Wainwright says: 'My experience at sessions of the AAR has been that questions of the truth or rational adequacy of nondualism, say, or the anatman doctrine are seldom raised. And when they are, one is often made to feel that one's question is somehow impolite.' 14 With respect to philosophical doctrines, Wittgenstein's investigations are critically far-reaching. He would not be content to say, as Wolterstorff is, that the physicalist has his own assumptions which he is rational in holding.On the contrary, physicalism, like dualism, is subjected to a logical critique. With the religious belief it is different: here, to speak of falsehood is itself to make a religious judgement. Wainwright asks: 'But do we really respect the men and women whose beliefs and practices we examine if we don't take their claims to truth, and rational and spiritual superiority, seriously?' 15 Different issues are run together here, but, in a religious context, philosophical respect is shown by not distorting the notions of truth involved, and by being clear about what philosophy can and cannot do. Kierkegaard argued that the distinctive contribution made by philosophy to 'the monstrous illusion' in the Denmark of his day, was precisely to turn religious belief into a philosophical thesis. That is something which O. K. Bouwsma emphasised again and again in his writings and why Wolterstorff is wrong to suggest that there are 'Bouwsmas' everywhere in analytic philosophy of religion.16</page><page sequence="13">RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY, AND THE ACADEMY 141 On the contrary, the prevailing tendency there is to distort religious con- cepts by assimilating them to contexts which obscures them. This is made all the more pervasive by the assumption that philosophical perspectives, such as physicalism cannot be engaged with because, like theism, they too have their underground assumptions. The attitude seems to be Til let you play your game, if you let me play mine'. Or better: 'I can't stop you playing your game and you can't stop me playing mine'. Interestingly, the APA philosophers are in the grip of the influence of the evidentialism they think they are free of. They think that the difference games could only be commented on if there were common evidence by which they could be rationally assessed. Since such common evidence is lacking, each to his own if it works for him. There is an interesting connection between these conclusions and the crude forms of pragmatism which has gone unnoticed for the most part. But when Wittgenstein comments on the different language games we play he is not indulging in anything like evidentialism, but, rather, contemplating, conceptually, the grammatical differences between these games, including grammatical differences in the notion of truth. Jesus does not say 'It is true that I am the way and the life', but 'I am the way, the truth and the life'. This affects, as Kierkegaard showed, the difference between following Socrates and following Christ.17 It is connected also with the difference, brought out well by Robert Roberts, between narratives which exemplify a virtue, and narratives which provide the grammar of what constitutes a virtue. Religious narratives are of this kind.18 But are there not different conceptions of truth in these contexts, different narratives? Indeed there are, and they make claims on us. But how they do this cannot be laid out in any systematic way. The question must arise for you. Does Nietzsche in fact invade your religious faith? Does Freud? If they do, they do. The concern for truth will then show itself in that struggle and how it is resolved. Sometimes, it is not resolved and someone like Isaac Babel in his stories may be torn all through life by conflicting and competing conceptions of virtue and spirituality. In these struggles we see what a search for truth looks like. To ask, Tell us what truth is' as though these contexts can be by-passed is to distort what 'coming to the truth' is like within them. It is at this point that AAR philosophers often draw mistaken conclusions. For the very reasons I have outlined, they say that issues of truth cannot be raised because truth is unavailable. What needs to be emphasised is the ways in which issues of truth are raised, and to see, from this, why philos- ophy cannot determine the outcome. Westphal says that secular Continental thought claims that there are no 'absolutes' . But this is a case of denying ordi- nary absolutes because one has seen that there is no metaphysical 'absolute'.</page><page sequence="14">142 D. Z. PHILLIPS And if it is said that truth cannot be aimed at, what of those who proclaim truths of various kinds? Again, the opposite tendency is to say that since such proclamations are many, They are all true'. But out of whose mouth does that confession come? Since the proclamations often conflict, does that confession even make sense? And to say that things are held to be true from different points of view is to say no more than that people judge as they do. 'The truth of the matter' cannot be settled independently of the conflict of claims. It is settled in the conflict. The picture of each game safe with its own presuppositions does not do justice to the reality of its conflict. Sometimes in Catholic thought, as in Reformed epistemology, one has the impression that people have all the answers at the outset. If all that means is that some people are not beset by conflicts of belief, so be it. But sometimes this attitude is taken as a sign of avoiding conflict or as a sign of having resolved it in a certain way without even engaging with it. Contrast the following remarks by Rush Rhees: 'It would make more sense, to me in my darkness, if Catholics tried first and foremost to convince themselves that they are not better, and do not lead better lives, than those who are not Catholics. I think that if I were a Catholic and wanted to speak with someone, or get within speaking distance of someone who had rejected Christianity, I would think it my duty to try with all my heart and soul to think that that man was right in his rejection. Then I might make a beginning of understanding what his difficulty was. And he might begin to think I was facing the difficulty with him - instead of speaking to him as a member of those who have received the Grace of God (maybe, after all, / haven't), or as a spokesman of a Church which knows all the answers and has known them for centuries.' 19 This is not a matter of evidentialism, but of one conception of truth expe- riencing the genuine pull of another. In giving perspicuous representations of situations such as these, philosophy, at the same time, shows how it cannot resolve them. Its task is to bring out what 'resolution', 'lack of resolution', etc, come to in these contexts. The AAR philosophers are often right in assuming that some of their APA counterparts, evidentialists in particular, want to impose an artificial unity on this hubbub of voices. Furthermore they claim that genuine involvement is often avoided. Walter Lowe suggests this is so in the clash between religion and Freudianism. He says that the APA philosophers rarely discuss the hermeneutics of suspicion. Again, this is not true of the Wittgensteinian tradition. It could be said that Wittgenstein made us suspicious of suspicion.20 Freud and Marx said that truth was to be found below the surface of things. It can be said that Wittgenstein restored surfaces - the surfaces of the ordinary. He said that to learn from Freud, one has to be critical of him. Freud liked to think of</page><page sequence="15">RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY, AND THE ACADEMY 1 43 himself as offering an explanation of the ancient myths, whereas what he does, Wittgenstein claims, is to offer us a myth of his own - a different way of looking at the world - a way which many embrace as truth. In the Wittgensteinian tradition, however, there has been a long-standing engagement with the methodological assumptions of the social sciences and the claims to provide reductionist analysis of religious beliefs. Unlike philosophers in the APA group, they have not said that these analyses are viewpoints with their own presuppositions. They criticise their assumptions. This clears the ground in such a way as to distinguish genuine conflict from what philosophy so often makes of it.21 How is this to be shown? Only through discussion. There is no alternative. In my experience, analytic philosophers of religion have shown impatience with this. As one said to me, 'If you say I am confused and I deny it, how is that matter to be settled? We might as well all go home'. Others think it can be settled by a sociological survey of what people think religious belief is. But philosophy cannot be done in that way. What people say will itself be an attempt at philosophising. I repeat: there is no alternative to discussion. When I appeal to 'What we say' I mean 'You, the person I am talking to'. And in his reply, the person means 'me' when he makes a similar appeal. As Socrates said long ago, in philosophical discussion, only one opinion is being sought: that of the person addressed. When a philosopher of mathematics said that no one was going to drive him out of the paradise which Cantor had created, Wittgenstein said that he would not dream of driving anyone out of paradise. He would try to get the person to see that it wasn't paradise and then he would walk out of his own accord. My aim has been to show confusions present in both sides in the dispute between the APA and AAR philosophers.22 I want them to walk out of their own accord by giving a certain kind of attention to the lives we lead, lives which I believe their philosophies distort in different ways. To do this I must engage in discussion with them, and, in that discussion, I may be the one who walks out of a false paradise. The obstacles are many, not least the fact that often the trouble comes, not from the fact that we confuse the logic of our language, but that certain forms of language may mean nothing to us. In the philosophy of religion we may have to face the fact that our disagreements are not about the conceptual character of a religion we agree on, but come, partly, from the fact that what religion means to us is itself a mixed bag; that the hopes and expectations we entertain in the name of religion may be radically diverse. Nevertheless, there is still no alternative to discussion in an attempt to become clear about that fact. Kierkegaard said that religion cannot conquer by force. Neither can philosophy.</page><page sequence="16">144 D. Z. PHILLIPS Notes 1. Atlanta, GA: Scholars Press, 1996. 2.
