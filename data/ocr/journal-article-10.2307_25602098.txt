Noth ing has changed since Paul de Man proposed that "Derrida's work is one of the places where the future possibility of literary criticism is being de cided."1 Derrida had given much to this project when de Man wrote over twenty years ago. Not only has there been since then much more from Derrida that is still to be assimilated; those same early works read by de Man have themselves by no means settled into the inertia of received posi tions. Derrida's readings (of Rousseau, Hegel and many others) and ways of reading (which are themselves the emanations of a certain Romanticism according to which all philosophy must become literature) continue to ex ceed the interpretations that would contain them and will remain urgent and incomplete as long as there is some articulate opposition to those au thorities purporting to administer the litmus-test for deciding what is poi son and what is cure. Those who, deny or ignore the debt will only add to the amount of interest coming due in a transaction that is still perhaps best imagined as the monstrosity projected in Of Grammatology?that "for which there is as yet no exergue," the as yet unthinkable shape signifying the end of logocentrism and of the logic of filiation that includes within it the patristic figure of capital itself, the parent sum.2 After the end of the Soviet empire in 1989 Derrida responded to the near-hysterical victory songs of many in the neoliberal West with another reminder of monstrosities still to come. Many reservations have now been lodged and circulated about Derrida's long-awaited encounter with Marx (adumbrated in Positions to be sure but still declared there as yet to happen).

We know too that the spellbinding quality of Derrida's reading of Marx is distinctly en abled by his avoidance of any close engagement with a long and complex tradition of elaboration, comment and critique of Marx and Marxism.3 Nonetheless that reading remains spellbinding, and I find myself, like many others, haunted by Derrida's analysis of haunting and hauntology. This surely reflects an identification with his desire that the neoliberal he gemony might indeed have to reckon with the appearance of specters still to come. But it is not just that, because for a student of Romanticism these ghosts are vividly apparent in the texts recording the condition of England around 1800. They have not always been so visible; it is Derrida who has enabled us to see them taking shape as if for the first time in and through the mists of literary history. The haunted present that is contemporary life can then look to Romanticism as an exemplary form of its own preexist cnce. The ghosts and ghostly forms inhabiting, for instance, Wordsworth's poetry (which will be my topic here) bespeak a historical condition whose determinations we have not yet supplanted or displaced. This does not mean that nothing has changed, or that everything written around the year 1800 matters to the 21st century in the same way and to the same degree. It is rather the sign of a specific (and particularly powerful) formation whose limits we are not yet in a position to project. The light that is not yet to be glimpsed would only appear at the end of the historical tunnel of commod ity form, which took on unprecedented importance for culture and con sciousness around 1800 and has remained formative and dominant ever since. It would be consoling to suppose, recalling the Derrida of 1967, that the mere fact of articulating this haunted paradigm, of being able to make it thinkable at all, is itself the portent of its approaching closure and of a life 3.

We are now less confident of an imminent epistemological break and a corresponding shift in the order of the world. The most recent debate about the case for and against radical historical change, that around the notion of the postmodern, has not pro duced consensus. I have been interested in fetishism and reification as central and critically contested obsessions in Romantic aesthetics for a long time, but I had al ways (before reading Derrida) missed seeing or understanding the ghosts, and thus missed an opportunity to reconsider the force of Marx's meta phors (and their literary analogues) as well as of his seemingly literal argu ments about the achieved hegemony of commodity form.4 Literature to be sure has been comfortable enough with ghosts. There were the ghosts of the Gothic novel, and of the English ballads and wild German poems that fed into and came out of it, along with those of the Shakespearean stage. But these ghosts were either offered as "real" ghosts, emanations of the su pernatural, or they were demystified as projections of troubled or excited minds, perhaps of minds intoxicated with too much reading of the wrong sort. Either Enlightenment thought conjured ghosts away in order to bring us to our senses, or counterenlightenment reinstated them as fully and gro tesquely real. Occasionally Gothic artifice leaves us hanging about which is which and how to tell the difference (this is what Todorov calls "the fan tastic"); even more occasionally, as in the spectacular case of The Monk (1796), mystery and demystification tumble over one another from page to page in a hurly-burly so apparently indiscriminate and devoid of metaphys ical or methodological charge that one might suspect the impersonal opera tions of the logic of commodification itself to be the governing energy behind the story, the force propelling one arresting moment into the next in a celebration of sheer contiguity, a narrative vindication of the general equivalent masquerading as a surprise which is always the same surprise.5 But the Gothic was what Wordsworth said he sought to exorcize from the national literary culture; its trappings were therefore not to be taken se riously (I must have thought) as ghosts worth being haunted by. The su pernatural part of the job, if it had to be done, was to have been done by Coleridge. The famous division of labor set out in Biographia Literaria recalls Coleridge assigning himself that role and conversely nominating Words worth as the poet of real men and ordinary nature, the one who was to "give the charm of novelty to things of every day" and focus the mind on 4.

He was to excite feelings "analogous to the supernatural" but not of them.6 In the 1800 preface to Lyrical Ballads Wordsworth himself claimed to be turning aside from "gross and violent stimulants," avoiding even "personifications or abstract ideas," in the wor thy cause of showing that "the power of the human imagination is suf ficient to produce such changes even in our physical nature as might almost appear miraculous."7 This last admission is all too easily read as an enco mium to the revivifying and creative powers of the mind, to the received idea of the imagination, and of course it is often exactly that. But it is then all too easy to miss the other side of the coin, the shadow of the substance, the "real" ghostliness of things that the imagination wants to attribute to it self, to its singular figurative operations, but which (in so far as it is a shared imagination) we might more correctly assign to a general condition. Wordsworth's interest in poetically staging figures who are between death and life, not dead but never fully alive, either animated things or dean imated persons, ghosts who are not fully of the present yet seem bereft of accessible pasts?haunting the present from the present itself?does not im mediately lead us to the absent presence that is commodity form, but that is the direction I am now suggesting. It is Derrida who has insisted on Marx's deep understanding of "the ghosts that are commodities," commodities that "transform human products into ghosts" by way of a "becoming social" that is enacted through "spectralization."8 Derrida is here, as so of ten, a guide to the underworld of common sense, and the master of its un raveling. He is also a guide to Wordsworth. There is a striking passage in Words worth's account of his visit to the "sacred Mansion" that is the convent of Chartreuse in the summer of 1790.9 On the approach to the convent he claims to recall seeing Arms flashing, and a military glare Of riotous men commissioned to expel The blameless Inmates; and belike subvert That frame of social being, which so long Had bodied forth the ghostliness of things In silence visible, and perpetual calm.

This is the poet throwing his voice, of course, and leav ing us hanging about whether this could really be a performative injunc tion lodged by forces not to be disobeyed (the enthused Romantic prophet) or a wishful request from a relatively powerless visiting poet. There are other puzzles. We know that Wordsworth could not have thrown himself or nature in front of the flashing swords and spears of the soldiers because in the summer of 1790 they were, as Mary Moorman points out, not there: only in 1792 were the monks expelled.10 A slip of memory perhaps, since Wordsworth did not start writing this part of the poem until some time between 1818 and 1820, the records of which Mark Reed has published as the C-Stage reading text in his reconstruction of the immensely complicated manuscript history of Wordsworth's mid-career drafts of his autobiographical epic.11 But slips of memory are often the bearers of significant interpretive energies. The first frisson in this passage comes from the invocation of the ghostli ness of things. What kind of things are ghostly? If these are matters spiri tual, metaphysical things, then one would not expect to see them described as ghostly, as legacies of a deceased material life still lingering in the world in spectral form. Protestant-Christian spiritual truths, if they are conven tionally held, are formless and out of this world but not spectral. If, on the other hand, these are the ghostly forms of things that were formerly in the world, then in what sense are they no longer alive or self-evident? Why do they require being "bodied forth" if not as reductive or weirdly mimetic versions of what is already there? Without the social "frame" that is the convent, we are told, ghostliness would not take on embodied form. The great Kantian reformulation of the domain of Verstand, the understanding, had insisted that noumena (things in themselves) are what must be assumed to exist in order to explain experience, but they are never to be deemed as bodied forth. Kant thus remained observant of a strict distinction between the realm of sense and that of spirit: no border crossings. Most commonly it is our ideas about things that are described as insubstantial and shape shifting, with things in themselves remaining as virtual or imagined figures of continuous presence: Wordsworth's poems elsewhere fully investigate the varieties of phenomenal figuration as always refigurative. But here what is embodied in the walls of the convent is ghostliness itself, a nothing that is somehow visible as a thing. The phrase is not comfortably deciphered by what follows, which tells us io.

How is a quality marked by absence, the absence of sound, made visible? How and when is calmness perpetual? Is this not the caput mortuum, the death's head? Who or what but the figure of death can be made visible by its silence, can claim (because already dead) devotion to eternity? But that which here is death has been made by man, has been as it were put to death: men have built the convent to remind themselves, it seems, of death. This is a Carthusian convent, inhabited by men who had taken a vow of silence; they could be seen but did not speak, like ghosts. Both the building and the persons who occupy it are death's heads, a composite me mento mori. We know that Wordsworth spent two days staying at this still unviolated place and thus had plenty of time to dwell with and upon the sight of silent men hovering in attendance upon their guests. It is a conven tional enough response, in such a place, to think upon death, as one is in deed bidden to do, and perhaps to remember Milton, as Wordsworth does so often and as he does here in the ghostly form of Samson, who defeated armies of riotous men, who was punished for being unable to keep silent, who heard "the tread of many feet steering this way" (m), and who him self destroyed a "temple" as Wordsworth claims the revolutionary army is about to do. Is Wordsworth a Samson figure, willing to bring down the temple upon his own head in order to punish his enemies and save his ideals from desecration? This is after all a Catholic convent, and thus a site for accepting or rejecting the purgatorial half-world in which ghosts do walk while waiting for a future (eternal) life. Is Wordsworth a Protestant Samson? Is the destruction of the temple desired even as it is resisted? The poet claims to be a preserver, a defender of Christian traditions against a secular incursion whose onset he conjures up against the historical record. Samson also invoked a synaesthetic deprivation?the sun "now silent as the moon" (87)?which in its metonymic compression (sun, daytime, time of human action and sound) also makes us work to decipher how it is that what is already silent (the sun) can be more silent, or made to be as silent as another heavenly body which is no more or less silent than it is itself. Wordsworth's "silence visible" of course mimics the well-known "dark ness visible" of Paradise Lost (1: 63). All of these Miltonisms (and more than Milton) are gathered up a few lines later in the mention of "Vallombre's groves" (481)?Vallombre just happening to be the name of one of the val leys of the Chartreuse while embodying also an entire epic tradition, pagan and Christian (Virgil, Dante, Milton and beyond) of falling leaves, of the shady site of death and death in life. This is where the poet and his com panion "fed the Soul with darkness" (482) after passing through forests "unapproachable by death" (467). Unapproachable perhaps because already suffused with death, the death that is everywhere in the narration of this episode.</page><page sequence="7">DERRIDA'S GHOSTS 189 It is then possible that Wordsworth's lapse of memory is not simple, that the superimposition of the (unseen) events of 1792 upon the recollections of 1790 has to do with the interpellation of Samson Agonistes, and of the iconoclastic hero of Milton's poem as the type of the here disavowed de stroyers of a temple Wordsworth claims to want to preserve, but which in its preserved form actually images the reign of death in life. The passage is full of death, and while it is good Christian doctrine to recall our promised end in the spirit of resignation and active faith, it is also tempting to discern a Wordsworthian longing for what is unapproachable by death. The pines that whisper in the wind are "not silent," nor are the "Sister Streams of Life and Death" whose murmurs are heard from below (438, 440). Do these twin streams represent a choice, as of life over death, or a conflation of life with death, as its unavoidable destiny? Is it just a future destiny, or is there death in life already and at all times? The poet need not have worried that the revolutionary enlightenment would do away with These courts mysterious, where a step advanced Between the portals of the shadowy rocks Leaves far behind life's treacherous vanities (452-54) He certainly could not have fooled himself, by 1850 or even by 1818, that state-supported religion was about to disappear from the face of the earth. But suppose he might have wanted it to, at some deep level? Suppose he wished that this temple might be destroyed, even though Samson the he roic destroyer brought about his own death, because its figuring of death was just too overpowering? Not just of death itself, but of death in life, im aged in the silent monks (who are not mentioned directly in the poem), in the ghostly form of what they have built, in the poet's inevitable passage into a silence and stillness that nature seems to counter with its murmuring streams and whispering winds but which renders that which is "unap proachable by death" as either too painfully nonhuman to be borne, or be yond death because already in some way dead, not so much a consolation for the "blank abyss" (470) as a reminder of the abyss itself that makes one require consolation in the first place? It is death and not just religious faith that most fully manages "to equalize in God's pure sight / Monarch and Peasant" (456-57). Wordsworth's declared negation of the revolutionary claim of equality on earth is compromised by a wish that it might prove true, and by a fearful admission that while the death to come closes all, death in life is already in control. The undescribed two-day sojourn at the convent provided a spectacle of living death and an experience of death in life, while the convent itself is put to death prematurely (destroyed before its time) in the poet's memory. Absent also from the ongoing argument is any sustained embodiment of</page><page sequence="8">190 DAVID SIMPSON Christian faith. Instead the narrative specifies that the preservation of posi tive mystery has more to do with the afterlife of history than of enlivened faith in potentially resurrected bodies: But oh! If past and future be the wings On whose support harmoniously conjoined Moves the great Spirit of human Knowledge, spare These courts mysterious . . . (449-52) Wordsworth here rehearses a recognizably Burkean commitment to the past as the necessary condition of a psychologically bearable and modestly reformist future, but he does so in a quite secular way, without any eager ness to set his sights on personal salvation outside of a proto-Hegelian en gine powering historical time. The convent's "votaries" represent "con quest over sense" (459) but the spirit that they embody is spectral, as if it were a relic of the sensory world they have not quite left behind. What this building does for those caught up in "life's treacherous vanities" (454) is to remind them not of a glorious life beyond but simply of death, and of things haunted by their own supernatural selves: the ghostliness of things. Wordsworth here fashions a strangely flattened version of the ideology cy cle as Marx described it. Things are not seen as passing from heaven to earth, as Marx thought that Hegel made them do: there is only earth. Nor do they then pass from earth to heaven: there is no heaven. Ghosts belong to earth as the images of earthly things. In rewriting spirituality as the stuff of ordinary life (as Marx rewrote Hegel) Wordsworth is indeed fulfilling the task he says he set himself in Lyrical Ballads, but in energizing the world of dead things with spirit (or imagination) it is death-in-life he interpellates. What was living is remembered as dead (the monks, the convent) because it was already dead, a visible silence, an eternity in time that fed the soul with darkness. It is a very ghostly scene that is here reported as having been seen. The vow of silence that the Carthusians elected is told in poetry as a chronicle of silence and displacement detached from any human forms whatsoever; the embodied things are ghostly and the living forms are as if already dead. These inversions correspond to a long list of Wordsworthian protagonists who project the features of the living dead, who move but do not speak (the old Cumberland beggar), who appear like ghosts (the dis charged soldier), who cannot be located unambiguously in either the past or the continuing present (poor Susan), who speak as if from another world (the leech gatherer). It can seem at times as if Wordsworth's poems amount collectively to one long spirit show. And what is shown, I suggest, is an en counter with what Derrida calls "the ghosts that are commodities," the</page><page sequence="9">DERRIDA'S GHOSTS 191 commodities that "transform human producers into ghosts" (Specters 156). This is not a matter of primitive fetishism, whereby the human agent fabri cates the totem it worships but feels able to toss it aside at the first sign of its faithlessness or inefficiency; here ghostly things now circulate in a world of their own and have no need to appease human needs and desires. They are beyond all human fears and indifferent to human tears. The commodity does not speak, says Marx: it is silence visible, a death's head, but one prone to take form as fantastic and phantasmagoric liveliness. Perhaps the most famous form of liveliness that Marx invokes is the ani mated table of Capital, which we will come to in a moment. First, some remarks about commodities in general and in particular in the years around 1800. Commodities are congealed forms of human labor and are as such ar guably immanent in all human production; but they are "phantom-like" \gespenstige]12 not so much in the primary detachment of each from the minds and hands of the persons who made them but more critically when they come to exist within the virtual, structured paradigm of a dispersed and intensified commodity form whose secondary abstraction (single prod uct into invisible, extended system of exchange) commits each single arte fact to an intangible and mysterious network not open to ocular proof or physical embodiment. The secondary abstraction thus becomes primary; it seems to come after production but is in fact before it in that modes and conditions of production are themselves driven by the dispersed economy of exchange much more than by simple conditions pertaining to the transi tion from certain raw materials to individually made objects. This inversion of the apparent order of importance in which things are made, with the in visible, systemic structure now dominating the process of making and dis tributing commodities, is historically specific; it is what is most radically transformed by the conditions of industrial capitalism, and the one that ex plains why it is only around 1800 that the world changes. If it were just a matter of the invention of money, or of the creation of objects for ex change, then the terms of human alienation would not differ between, say, classical Greece and the modern world.13 What changes in the course of the 12.

This is the implication in much of Jean-Joseph Goux's important work, which pro poses a long durational causality deriving from the money form as foundational to "sociohistorical structuration" and thus implicitly diminishes Marx's claim for the qualitative shift accruing with industrial capitalism. See Symbolic Economies: After Marx and Freud, trans. Jennifer Curtiss Gage (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1990) 24. A similar emphasis is to be found in Marc Shell, The Economy of Literature (Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins UP 1978), which discusses early Greek theories of the simultaneous origins of money, tyranny and phi losophy as cognate forms of invisible agency: spectral powers. See also Alfred Sohn-Rethel, Intellectual and Manual Labor: A Critique of Epistemology (Atlantic Highlands: Humanities P, 1983) 94-98.</page><page sequence="10">192 DAVID SIMPSON 18th century is the whole spectrum of circumstances that we call, rather loosely, social conditions and/or modes of production. The invention of modern banking, of mechanized, industrial production, "the encreasing ac cumulation of men in cities" (Wordsworth, Prose Works i: 128). and other related (though not simply consequent) developments?a huge increase in the circulation of print, various debt crises and increased dependency upon paper money and paper credit, the "massification" of warfare, the social and demographic results of empire?are among the primary components of a world that according to Marx was taking on a very new and terrifying shape. Some of the conditions of this world had been in place for a long time (money, exchange) but others had not. Thus Marx's sense of modern history was indeed that of what Derrida calls a "finite delirium," something that could be imagined as "coming to an end" (Specters 163) since it could be shown to have had a historical beginning, not at a single moment or in a single, simple form but as a coming-together of critical conditions in a way that changed the whole, quantity into quality. Derrida's motives for calling this into question as perhaps an immanent rather than a historical condition have to do with the desire to affirm a permanently messianic potential in Marx (whereby what is to come is always to come and thus can never come), and certainly with a desire to find spectrality inherent in all human production at all times, which would in his view commit Marx, in his imagining of an end to the ghosts, to an "ontology of presence" premised on "the possibility of dissipating the phantom" (170): as the ghosts disap pear so begins the real. The question, then, is whether the Marx who has, as Derrida mag nificently asserts, "not yet been received" (174), is best received as a closet universalist, who really means to tell us that the epistemological conditions of subject formation don't change that much (and as such of course he must remain relevant to all future being), and so the ghosts will always be with us; or whether, notwithstanding the immanence of certain spectral di mensions to objectification itself, the ghosts are different and differently in tense in the critical phases of capitalist modernization in the later eigh teenth century and thereafter. It is the second option that is borne out in the extraordinary obtrusion of ghostly hauntings in Wordsworth's poetry, quite different and differently weighted than in the earlier Gothic conven tions and more akin to the about-to-come intense interest in apparitional figures in Carlyle's work or in Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities or indeed in the writings of Marx himself. A full rehearsal of the issues or periodization raised by this shift is not possible here; but these literary transcriptions of around 1800 and thereafter reveal a more thorough penetration of the ordi nary world by spectral shapes than anything implied by the Gothic, al though the Gothic could be said to provide a vocabulary for them to work</page><page sequence="11">DERRIDA'S GHOSTS 193 with. It is because they do not coyly signal their status as part of a com modity culture simply conceived as the literary marketplace, and thereby in principle avoidable (as, say, The Monk does in its employment of avowed pastiche) that they are most pervasively inhabited by it, most intensely pre occupied with the insight that alternative forms of relation between persons or persons and things are becoming increasingly rare. They are not simply cries of lamentation that man has lost control of the products of his labor, though they can be that too; they register something much more pervasive and baffling, a general condition of commodification that now threatens to govern all perception and expression and all forms of life. This is not to be discovered in the literature of 1600 or 1700, even though shared concerns (over luxury or money and even division of labor, for example) may be found. Marx begins with general observations about transhistorical constit uents of the modern economy, for example with the argument that noth ing of matter [Naturstoff] enters into commodities as values, and with an analysis of the "mystery of money," but he does not end there.14 Spectrality may be there from the start, but it attains its maximum and critical potency only in the modern world. Derrida's gift to us here has been to issue an in junction against the ignoring of ghosts, and to propose that the form of the specter is the signature of the emergence of commodity form as hegemonic in the modern life that took form around 1800. What matters most is what you cannot see, or see clearly, and that whose origins and futures you can not trace. Commodity form is invisible but visible in its effects: draining life from persons and embodying life in things. And so to Marx's table. At the beginning of his discussion of the fetish ism of commodities he explains how a wooden table, in becoming a com modity, "changes into a thing which transcends sensuousness while re maining sensible [verwandelt er sich in ein sinnlich ubersinnliches Ding]" (Capital 163; Werke 23: 85). What is striking about this passage is Marx's comic ea gerness to personify the table as already having mind and agency of its own, whereby "it changes itself [verwandelt er sich]"?changes itself?into a sensi ble-supersensible thing. By Marx's own apparent logic, one should here say that it only seems this way because of its relation to other commodities, but what is said is that it enacts this transition upon itself. The table already has agency, we do not see it being given it. Marx goes on, famously: "It not only stands with its feet on the ground, but, in relation to all other com modities, it stands on its head, and evolves out of its wooden brain [Holzkopf] grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than if it were to begin 14. Capital 138-39; Werke 23: 62. The early sections of Capital do not, for example, discuss profit or mechanical production. They are not (and are not intended as) a complete account of the commodity form in the modern world. But we can only read one step at a time.</page><page sequence="12">194 DAVID SIMPSON dancing of its own free will [ausfreien Stucken]." The table, in fact, does not dance, but behaves in a way even more wonderful than it would if it were [als wenn er] dancing.15 It thinks itself into agency, but it does not move; and in so thinking it does something even more miraculous than dancing. We do not see anything happening, we are blinded to these events. Derrida brilliantly reads this paradox: "one must see, at first sight, what does not let itself be seen. And this is invisibility itself. For what first sight misses is the invisible" (Specters 149). This is the "ghostly schema ... a thing in flight that surpasses the senses," which Derrida wants to make into an instance of how "the specter" of the commodity is already "at work in use-value" (151). He is fascinated, and fascinates us, with the directness and apparent absurdity of Marx's prosopopeia. Marx does not say that the whole figure is hypothetical or mere projection; he says that the table really stands on its head while remaining on its feet and invents ideas more wonderful than if it were actually to dance. In other words the table dancing would be less of a miracle than its having ideas while standing still on its head. The dancing is something we might see, whereas we cannot see it having ideas. So how do we think it or infer this? And how do we know it is standing on its head if we cannot see it? This must be one of the famous "metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties" (Capital 163) that comes with the commodity. If it is a joke is it just a joke? (The jocular analogy in a footnote about the hitherto static China starting to move does not assist in clarifying a primary sense). Do we have only Marx's word for this, and for the table's standing on its head in relation to other commodities? Again the sense is active: it puts itself or sets itself up [er stellt sich] on its head in relation to or against or in the face of [gegenuber] all other commodities.16 Does Marx mean that it is in a uniquely antagonistic attitude, standing on its head as a way of competing for atten tion with other commodities in a marketplace? Or do all commodities do the same thing? Either way, who if anyone might see this? If the whole world is upside down, as it was once said to be in the famous early definition or illustration of the effects of ideology as akin to the effects of a camera obscura, then won't everything just look normal? Are all commod ities standing on their heads in relation to each other and thus all orienting themselves in the same direction? Who could see the topsy-turvy nature of 15- Marx's als wenn for als ob is apparently an item of Rhenish dialect, but it opens up at least the ghost of a temporal narrative (reading "as when") albeit one not supported by the strong subjunctive of zu tanzen beganne. My thanks to Gerhard Richter for his understanding of this sentence. 16. Derrida gets the active, competitive sense of this relation [er stellt sich alien andren Waren gegenuber] in saying that "it faces them or opposes them," "in a competition or in a war," be cause "the market is a front, a front among fronts, a confrontation" (Specters 151, 155).</page><page sequence="13">DERRIDA'S GHOSTS 195 this arrangement, who could stand outside the frame? (Marx accused Hegel of turning things upside down, standing them on their heads). Is the result of each commodity competing with others for attention to make them all look the same? What is most wonderful?the table generating ideas, or rather Grillen (whims, fancies, fads)?is the thing we do not see. If we then imagine it, are we acting like the mystics and spirit seers whose currency in the nineteenth century was the mark of a certain unreason? The dancing table would be most akin to the specter, and the specter is the analogue that Derrida pursues, imagining a dance that is not there, one obeying "the technical rigidity of a program" (Specters 153). Were it happening we would see it. But the table is not dancing, its mobility is only a case of "what if": if it were to dance then that would be less remarkable than what it does do when it has ideas of its own. Derrida brilliantly attributes this not-seeing what we are told is there (the upside down and thinking table) to the mirror that does not reflect, that shows us nothing, or "does not return the right reflection" (156), just as the ghost or vampire cannot be seen or see itself in a mirror. The commodity dazzles us, puts out our eyes (165). We do not see ourselves either, as we historically are, because we see only an ordinary table embodying the fiction of a mere use value. But this whole elaborate figure that Marx de vises here weirdly inverts, turns on its head or plays around with, ideology and its critique. The sign of our entrapment within the fetishism of the commodity is the attribution of living energy to inert things; but we con tinue to see sensuous things, a simple table, standing still in its place as tables do. The attribution of life to dead matter is imaginary, in the head, such that they become "supersensible or social." But it is also real, historically real: it is what we do with our own wooden heads. Commodity form and value relations have "absolutely no connection with the physical nature of the commodity" (Capital 165). We behave according to the logic of the fe tish when we think that tables have active powers that we cannot see. Marx puts us in this position through his abrupt and unexplained attribu tion of thought and motion to the table. He asks us to believe what we cannot see as a way of showing us what we are really thinking?that dead things have come to life and have taken over all the conventions and rou tines of human interaction and expression. Things figure themselves as figures in a process that seems to have nothing to do with us. But they can only do so through our own figurative openmindedness, in the face of common sense and ocular proof; through our being able or willing to imagine that tables imagine. There are thus (at least) two acts of self projection; that of the table can only occur (be represented) within that of the reading mind insofar as that mind can imagine the abdication of the very figurative faculty it is required to exercise in order to begin to under</page><page sequence="14">196 DAVID SIMPSON stand this explanation of the liveliness of things. We must imagine the transference of our own faculty for imagining. Common sense tells us that Marx is having us on; but that is just how ideology inhibits critique. To ac cept the spectral posturings of the rival commodities as something to be considered seriously is to accept the power over what we merely see of what we can only apprehend through a massive effort of thought: tables having whims and fancies. This is also the power of theory: the evidence of things unseen. But it is theory from within: when we think (not see) of the tables as thinking then we have positioned ourselves within the society of commodities, where the real action is. We are able to approach its secrets, not in the spirit of pure, disinterested critique, but as one of the gang. An thropomorphic projection to the point of seeming absurdity is the means whereby the historically dominant abdication and loss of creative opportu nity itself can begin to be apprehended (but not glimpsed). This is not the first occasion in Capital where things that are to our nor mal (precritical) senses quite inert take on the attributes of thought or in tention. In a little joke that now perhaps looks more serious, Marx de scribes how the coat is regarded by the linen: "Despite its buttoned-up appearance, the linen recognizes in it a splendid kindred soul, the soul of value" (143); in the same way one man sees another as king only as long as that other adopts the form of kingship.17 Again, since a commodity cannot "be related to itself as equivalent," it "must make [muss sie sich . . . machen] the physical shape of another commodity into its own value-form" (148; Werke 23: 71). These are playful passages?the "soul of value" [Wertseele] here surely jests at the Weltseele dear to Idealist metaphysics?but they fore cast the more dramatic throwing of the voice (and skewing of the eye) that informs the description of the table that thinks up its own capricious no tions. Here too we are invited to imagine the shadow-play and dialogue between things?coats and bolts of linen?as carrying out (and thus ex hausting, preempting) all the rituals of social life (meeting and greeting one another, saying hello) in a prescient prefiguring of the world of animated cartoons, the world of Disney, where knives and forks fight battles and dishes serve themselves. Derrida relates all of this to the operations of au tomatons, figures that look alive but are moving only mechanically, and thus to apparitions. What is to be decided is whether this imagined seeing of what cannot be seen?a mentally active table which only seems to us to stand dead, silent and upright, or a coat nodding at a piece of linen?is to be construed sim 17- For a fine study of this passage see Peter Stallybrass, "Marx's Coat," in ed. Patricia Spyer, Border Fetishisms: Material Objects in Unstable Spaces (New York and London: Routledge, 1998) 183?207. Stallybrass remarks that "the fetishism of the commodity inscribes immateriality as the defining feature of capitalism" (184).</page><page sequence="15">DERRIDA'S GHOSTS 197 ply as a projection of human qualities into inanimate things?the operation of primitive fetishism, what Derrida calls "anthropomorphic projection" (Specters 157)?or as something more and something more strange: the de lineation of a world in which it is impossible to distinguish the figurative from the literal, or to know whether what looks literal (and thus perma nent) is really figured (and impermanent, part of the finite delirium). The sphere in which we are most accustomed to approve "the willing suspen sion of disbelief for the moment" is of course that of "poetic faith," as Coleridge so memorably proposed (Biographia Literaria 2: 6). The capacity to entertain the image of a table turning itself on its head may smack more of fancy than of imagination in the highest degree (as the Romantics liked to think of it), but it definitely belongs to the same sector of the mind that is required for the understanding of and delight in good poetry. Is this what Derrida himself is exercising in his insistence, on more than one occasion in the last sections of Specters of Marx, that the wooden table really does dance even though Marx says clearly (more or less clearly) that it does not? Derrida wants commodities to do a dance, a "ghost dance," a habit that comes from the fact that commodities "have commerce amongst them selves. That is what makes them dance" (160, 155). But it is the dancing of automatons, casting the table as "a puppet, a stiff mechanical doll whose dance obeys the technical rigidity of a program" (153). Misreadings or mo tivated readings (for it seems almost inevitable that any reading of this ex traordinary section of Capital must risk something of a misreading) are al ways interesting, and more than usually so in the case of this closest of close readers, who has conjured back to life the ghosts that many of Marx's read ers have forgotten or deemed forever spirited away. For Paul de Man such so-called misreadings were the sources of insight itself, and he claimed to find one in Derrida reading Rousseau, in the closest of readers who gave reading "the dignity of a philosophical question" reading the philosopher who is "always being systematically misread" (Blindness and Insight no, 111). As de Man tells it, Derrida stages Rousseau as surreptitiously commit ted to a "metaphysics of presence" (119), as unable to see the full effect of his own best intuitions about a language which disrupts all attributions of presence, in a gesture that de Man finally deems purposive. It is much the same gesture?his refusal to admit that Rousseau's own theory of represen tation "is not directed toward meaning as presence and plenitude but to ward meaning as void" (127)?that Derrida repeats in the case of Marx, finding there too an "ontology of presence" (Specters 170), a covert foundationalism rooted in use-value, and a too-ready belief that the spec ters can be restricted to the imaginations of the bad or stupid guys. Here too Derrida holds back on any full rehearsal of the possibility that Marx, or Marx's text (like Rousseau and Rousseau's text according to de Man),</page><page sequence="16">198 DAVID SIMPSON knows what he or it is doing. But in making the table dance he, Derrida, makes it do a thing less remarkable than what it is doing according to Marx's account, which is thinking, having fanciful ideas [Grillen]. The dancing we could see?not so the thinking, which we can only think. The dancing then is an easier proof of the liveliness of the commodity than Marx wishes us to have. Derrida seems to have taken some sort of bait, to have joined a dance that isn't happening. What are the possible motives for such misreading? They are creative, of course. Derrida's own rhetorical near-delight at seeing the dance which is a dance of death seems to have to do with the joy of anthropomorphic projection itself, the joy of poetry; since commodities cannot go to market on their own (Derrida quotes Marx), it is only the spirit of speech and will that we breathe into them that creates the event (Specters 157), and in so doing Derrida has gone a step further than Marx wants him to. The commodities are having even more fun than they were in Capital: they are dancing with Derrida. But it is, we recall, a ghost dance, real enough but empty of weight and matter, a merry-go-round routine. It will be no surprise to anyone that I now look again at the most famous of all of Wordsworth's poems, perhaps the most famous Romantic poem in English, the one about the daffodils. It is a poem about dancing while standing still. Reading the poem again after Derrida after Marx it is hard to ignore the narrator's opening self-image in which he is?or makes himself?a sort of ghost. In claiming to wander "lonely as a cloud" he gives himself vaporous form and also abstracts himself from the living company of his sister whom we know to have accompanied him on this particular walk.18 Words worth's poetry is full of narrators who project themselves and those they encounter into lonely circuits of near-planetary proportions.19 Here the prospect of society is reinvented and transposed onto the "crowd" or "host" (one earthly, one angelic?) of daffodils with which the poet can commune in solitary and silent pleasure. The flowers do not of course dance, but are animated as if dancing (though always on the spot, like the table turning on its head). Wordsworth suppresses the simile in favor of an unembarrassed personification: "A host of dancing Daffodils . . . Ten thou sand dancing in the breeze."20 He thereby asks us to imagine what did oc 18.

No more do the waves dance or laugh, as they are said to do, but the personifications are almost unnoticed because of their sheer familiarity: dancing and laughing waves and flowers belong to the common stock of poetic diction. So we might miss the extravagant delight in absurdity whereby waves and flowers compete for the honor of being most gleeful: "The waves beside them danced, but they / Outdid the sparkling waves in glee." These are the images that compose the "wealth" (12) that the poet is unconsciously storing up, allowing him to activate his own inert domestic loneliness ("In vacant or in pensive mood") with an after-image of delight. Like an automaton or a cistern, the poet's "heart with pleasure fills," and when the fill reaches the right level it "dances with the Daffodils." The familiarly understood sense of this poem notices the transference of energy from wind to flowers and waves to the heart of the poet and accepts it as a vindication of the power of correspondent breezes and the shared re ceptivity of human and nonhuman objects to animating but invisible forces. There is nothing wrong with this. But to accede too readily to an uplifting doctrinal (albeit somewhat pagan) reading is to miss the near comic ungainliness of the figures, the odd invocation of "wealth," the stag ing of the narrator as a spectral presence, and the elision of human society that makes the whole cycle available only to one enjoying the "bliss of soli tude" (16). It is easy enough to acquiesce in the images of dancing waves and flowers, but perhaps harder to imagine the poet's heart dancing with the daffodils. We cannot see this: the poet is lying on his couch and the movement is all internal. His enjoyment of his wealth is hidden from sight. The dancing heart is like Marx's dancing table, unnoticed except by those for whom it performs and with whom it competes. Without the after image on the inward eye the heart is unactivated, and when it is activated we still cannot see it. As when the coat speaks to the linen, the social life of the poem is entirely among things, with the poet reduced to or figured as an automaton responding in private to the unanticipated stimulus that is his wealth. The image is reproducible and exchangeable (flowers to heart to published poem) without enabling any society that is not virtual or imagi nary. Wordsworth has made himself alone again, as he did at the convent of Chartreuse, a ghost figure enjoying his own apparitions. He only seems to be lying still and unenlivened; in reality his heart is dancing with the flowers. We can only believe, we cannot see. Wordsworth is still human, not the "sort of automaton" Derrida saw in the wooden table, "a stiff and mechanical doll whose dance obeys the technical rigidity of a program" (Specters 153). But the precious sign of this humanity, the figurative faculty,</page><page sequence="18">200 DAVID SIMPSON is invisible to us and therefore not a means to sociability. Contact can only be made in the virtual domain of the reading experience, through being told, which Michael specified in the last book of Paradise Lost as the fate of fallen man: objects divine Must needs impair and weary human sense: Henceforth what is to come I will relate (12: 9-11) We have to believe what we cannot see. This too is the means of and me dium for poetry and the mechanism of personification: dancing daffodils. It is also the means of and medium for the presentation and possible critique (by way of theory) of the fetishism of commodities: dancing tables. Marx immerses us in a seemingly impossible series of subject positions (commod ity and not commodity, seeing and not seeing) to alert us to a crisis that seems at this point in his exposition best approached comically. Words worth does something similar without declaring any breach of faith in the power of imagination?indeed while declaring the opposite?in his careful employment of naturalized figures and pleasurable absurdity: waves com peting with flowers to be (not seem) most gleeful. The ghostliness of things is at once the signature of the power of commodity form (which has itself embraced the afterlife of this most famous poem), the power of the human imagination and of poetry, and the power of death in life that haunts both in these years around 1800. (In 1815 Wordsworth brilliantly revises the poem to delete the glee contest and compares the daffodils to stars "that twinkle on the milky way," reinstating by grand cosmic analogy what Derrida would call the "technical rigidity of a program"). Wordsworth writing for his reader is not quite a coat talking to linen, but there is a nota ble irony in his inserting himself into a cycle of natural energy he has him self figured (dancing flowers) even as he hopes that the figure does not ex haust the animating force whose effects led him to invoke it. At the convent of Chartreuse the ghostliness of things could be seen as bodied forth, but what is embodied is death; under the spell of commodity fetish ism the liveliness of things is also ghostly, apparitional, visible only as invisi ble, and here it subsists only to the degree that it deprives humans (and per suades them to deprive themselves) of the energies they now attribute to things. The wealth that the narrator of the daffodils poem cashes in is also invisible; his silent heart dances along with the flowers he has himself me morialized as figures in a dance. If his dancing heart is visited by the stored up wind energy triggered by his inward eye, then it is all for himself: no one else can tell. The successful transformation of passive leisure to active pleasure would be a refutation of the determinations of commodity culture</page><page sequence="19">DERRIDA'S GHOSTS 201 and commodity form, and as such it was at the heart of Wordsworth's aes thetic project. But it cannot, except by the virtual way of the book, assure the intactness of the "definite social relation between men themselves" nor prevent them from assuming "the fantastic form of a relation between things" like waves and flowers (Capital 165). One of the poster-poems of Romantic ideology cannot resist beginning to undo itself, and this is to Wordsworth's credit: a down-payment on the debt we owe to Derrida. Derrida, who had not yet finished with Marx, who projected possible solu tions in "work to come," which he would "try to do . . . elsewhere" (Spec ters 167, 173), work he had promised ever since Positions and was (after do ing it) still promising, because?I submit?he sensed that the monstrosity that might signal the end of the reign of commodity form has not yet ap peared on the horizon, because he could not promise to put an end to the dance, because he could not see an end to the "metaphysical subtleties" of commodity culture any more than Wordsworth could. He has left us to continue this work, not in the light of a promised end, but in hopes of a clearer beginning. This is a debt immense: there is no time to lose, but there is plenty of time.
