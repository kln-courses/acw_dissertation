<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BIRTH OF The Japanese Theater by THOMAS IMMOOS T . VHE Japanese theater well is worth studying not only because of its intrinsic value as one ofthe most remarkable accomplishments in dramatic art. An additional value, not yet fully grasped by the scholars in comparative drama, is to be found in the fact that the Japanese situation allows us to investigate all the manifold variations of theatrical arts and folklore in a still very living tradition. This means that we are able to survey the history of the theater from the archetypal patterns of ritual dance and drama to the most avant-garde happenings in a continuous series. It is due to the Japanese genius for preserving cultural achievements that next to nothing has ever been lost of ancient arts, whereas the equally outstanding Japanese ability to absorb foreign influences keeps adding all the time new forms, fads and fashions to an eminently living and lusty art. The archeologist is grateful for sites which show the successive layers of cultures in an undisturbed sequence, thus permitting him to determine an exact stratification picture. The investigation of the Japanese theater should allow us to understand better similar developments in other cultures were the old forms have been lost or survive only in half-forgotten remnants. Japan offers us a stratification picture of the whole history of world theater. In order to appreciate fully the immense treasure trove in the living theater of Japan, we would have to imagine that in Europe the prehistoric rituals had somehow survived to this age, that the Greek tragedy had been performed below the Acropolis down through the centuries in the same patterns of dancing, music and acting as in the classical age of Sophocles, that in Rome the comedies of Plautus and Terence and the art of the mimes had never died out, that in the monasteries and cathedrals the medieval mysteries were still a living form, that the artisans of Niirnberg were still performing Hans Sachs' carnival plays, that the Globe Theatre was still in the hands of Shakespeare's family with the descendants faithfully, handing down the remembrance of every inflection, gesture and bit of advice of the great master. It is only in this perspective that we can fully grasp the extent of our losses in the West and the immense richness of the theatrical heritage in Japan. 4ITHE AUTHOR is Professor ofComparative Litera- I ture and Chinese Civilization, Sophia University, Tokyo.</page><page sequence="2">404 Monumenta Nipponica, XXIV, 4 In this paper I would like to investigate what the living forms of theater can teach us about archetypal rites and performances. Our method will consist in isolating such performances as show most clearly archaic survivals. It is quite obvious that today's performers, and perhaps even the scholars investigating these ancient forms, are often unaware of the original meaning of the rites. Even the texts accompanying them are no sure guide, because such texts rarely date from before the Tokugawa period, and they contain a mixture of quotations and additions which sometimes even obscure the original rites. The only safe procedure seems to be to work out the basic pattern of a rite or play and to compare it with similar events of the same structure in other cultures. This com- parative approach is, of course, full of snares for the unwary, yet it seems to open up a path into a fascinating area of studies which may even help towards a better understand- ing of such forms as noh, by tracing conventions and usages to their original meaning. I. RITUAL DANCES OF MAGIC Primitive man finds himself in the midst of a closely-knit web of mysterious powers and influences which have a bearing on his own fate. In a 'participation mystique' his own actions are linked to the cosmic processes in a system of portentous correspondences. The medium of this participation mystique is a powerful, all-pervading substance which is commonly called mana. It is of the greatest importance for man to maintain the proper attitudes toward these mysterious powers. Thus he must do 'the right things' within this system of correspondences and avoid anything which might upset them. There exist humans who know how to extend influence over these powers. They possess the all-pervading mana in a special degree and are therefore able to influence the course of events, be it through mental concentration, or be it through ceremonies and rites. They are often called shamans. Archetypal theater begins with their performances, which are essentially rites of magic, of participation mystique. The step from religious ritual to art is a small one. Early man is not a philosopher, but a man of action. Rather than express his wishes to the supernatural powers by prayers, he acts out what he desires. Thus drama is born, the dromenon in the literal sense of the word-a thing done-but first performed in a strict- ly ritual context. Ritual is the expression of strongly felt emotions and desires by rep- resenting, by making, by doing the object or act desired. Rather than pray for the sun to appear in the cold winter nights, or for rain to fall in the proper seasons, a dance is performed which shows the desired event and helps bring it about by sympathetic magic Cjujutsu,1 Vor-abmung). 1 "X X .

Thus it is performed before the troupe leaves the village or cave. I think this pre-presentation of a desired future event is ritual in the proper sense, whereas the re-representation of a past event for the benefit of an appreciative audience is art. Both are equally archetypal in nature and correspond to deeply felt human emo- tions. Such pantomimic hunting dances are depicted on many walls of prehistoric caves in France and Spain, probably dating from as far back as 40,000 years ago.2 Recently I was able to see a hunting dance in a village in Kyushu which reminded me very much of such archaic rituals. A hamlet in the town of Yamanokuchi in Miyazaki prefecture has a troupe of puppet players performing bunya-jjruri,3 an early form of puppetry in which each puppet is manipulated by only one man, instead of three as in later techniques. The present repertoire consists of two plays by Chikamatsu Monzaemon. The little play which drew my attention, however, stands outside of this tradition. It is a kyogen farce without a fixed text; words are improvised according to the circumstances. The per- formance takes place in the village hall in autumn before the hunters set out into the mountains for their annual boar-hunt. Two characters, the big-headed fool Taro and Yazo, the small, bright boy, are called out for the hunt. The excitement of the hunt is vividly portrayed by a seventy-year-old man, who is at present head of the local education department, running around with the puppet of a dog barking energetically. When the hunters arrive at the mountain, a bamboo whistle announces the dreadful coming of the mountain god. Sure enough, the monster, a dragon three meters long gliding on a bam- boo pole, makes its awful appearance. Soon he has the fool at his mercy, twines around him and swallows him. But Yazo, after much shouting and running, succeeds in shooting the monster with a rifle to the accompaniment of a suitable amount of noise, fire and smoke, and in freeing the fool from his predicament, to the great delight of the children. The archetypal pattern of sympathetic magic seems to me clearly recognizable, in spite of all changes in the course of time: the possible dangers and the overcoming of them are acted before the event in order to prevent their occurrence in reality. This simple play also offers an example of the two ways in which a god made his *J. E. Harrison, Ancient Art and Ritual, London, 3rd ed., I9I9. 2 See H.

The acoustic mask in this case takes the form of the bamboo whistle. Primitive man understood a god as an invisible being, possessing no form and shape, and therefore beyond the possibility of visible representation. He made himself heard, however, by the sounds of'Schwirrholzer' or 'bull-roarers', which can be found all over the world, by wooden trumpets, still in use in Africa and Australia, or by the sounding pots used by some pygmies. The weird sound of the bamboo whistle should be added to this venerable list of supernatural voices.4 In this context it should be noted that the flute in the ramabusbi-kagura tradition is the voice of the gods and is played by an invisible player in the room behind the stage, the gakuya, which is considered the abode of the gods. The other instruments are played on the stage in full view of the audience. Even in noh the flute is the instrument most held in veneration, and is played only at important points of the drama often associated with divine appearances. It is only from this perspective extending into an immense antiquity that we can fully understand that even today the flute in the noh play rep- resents the acoustic mask of the god. At this point I wish to mention the rituals of sympathetic magic developed in an agricultural setting. They are still very much alive all over the country in taue-odori, ta-asobi, emburi, dengaku etc.,6 and are one of the roots from which noh grew into its present form. I remember most vividly the cold winter night I watched such a rite on a hill near Ikebukuro, surrounded by the noise and steady hum of Tokyo traffic. Under the huge trees of a shrine a group of men danced around a great drum placed inside a sacred enclosure, singing and miming the different labors of planting, weeding and harvesting rice. The whole year's work in the fields is performed in advance of the real event in a long sequence of i6 songs and dances before a Shinto shrine. The purpose of this ritual is clearly to bring about the growth of the grain by acting the process out before the powers that grant fertility, so as to assist them in exerting their benevolent influence. Even in today's simplified performances, phallic implications are still notice- able.7 Space does not permit tracing in detail the development of such rites from archetypal patters to such fully matured noh plays in dengaku tradition as 'Kikusui' and 'Jisei',8 both auspicious in character. The first tells the story of a Chinese elixir of life, the second the myth of Tanabata, the blissful union of the weaving maid and the herdsman which is 4 Eberle, op. cit. pp. 368 if., 'Schwirrholz- Stimme Gottes'. 5 T.

Such plays were of course highly suited for inducing (calling down) good omens and fertility for men, animals, and plants, and clearly stand in the tradition of sympathetic magic. Rain-magic and fertility is also the theme of the rather curious noh play 'Ikkaku Sennin',9 the story of a hermit who had obtained complete mastery over nature by his asceticism and magic powers. One day after a heavy rain he slips on the path and breaks his water jar. Highly incensed, he blames the rain dragon for the accident and banishes him into a deep cave, thereby causing a terrible drought which dries up rivers and fields. The king sends a bevy of beautiful girls to the hermit's hut. They feast and dance before him, make him join the party, drink the forbidden wine and even take part in the dance, until he falls asleep. Thus he loses his magic power and cannot keep the rain dragon back any more. 'The dragon burst forth and a beneficial rain fell over the earth.' These few examples should illustrate how tracing back the noh to its archetypal patterns in archaic rituals provides us with a key to its deeper layers of meaning. 2. THEOPHANY IN ANIMAL DANCES The brief improvised Kyushu play described above illustrates the two earliest ways a divine being was represented by primitive man: the acoustic mask and the animal mask. The second aspect needs further discussion. Theophany by means of animal masks -of real or imaginary animals-is slightly later than the acoustic mask. The caves in France and Spain contain many drawings of shamans wearing the heads and skins of bears, deer and other animals. These animals inspired prehistoric man with a mixture of deep awe and affection by their might and prowess. The totem animal is all-important for the life of the clan. Man and clan, totem and ancestors, are all one. The mana power of the clan resides in the animal as if it were a receptacle or storehouse, from which the clan as well as the individual continually draws new power. Therefore strong animals are preferred as totems: lion, leopard, tiger, bear, crocodile, deer, bison, etc. The shaman who puts on the skin and head of an animal is the forerunner of the actor wearing costume and mask, but for him the event is not just an artistic happening, it is deadly serious. By wearing the mask of the totem animal he is being transformed into the god, possessed by his mana powers, able now to partake in the cosmic process (participa- tion mystique) and to use the supernatural powers for the benefit of the tribe. Later on mask and costume are simplified and stylized; the real head is replaced by a wooden mask, but this mask is still regarded as the tamashiro,10 the receptacle, of the god-not just his symbol but his real presence. It is only in this perspective that the function of the mask in Japanese theater stands out in clear relief. 9 AQA 10 St:</page><page sequence="6">408 Monumenta Nipponica, XXIV, 4 The lion's mask in the Yamabushi ritual, called gongen,11 is in reality worshipped as a god. The gongen mask is put on a big drum and placed in the tokonoma of the best room in the house where the performance is taking place. Offerings are brought before it, a candle is lighted, and only the bettj12 [priest] is allowed to spend the night in the same room. Thus the god is enthroned on his kamiza, god-seat. All the dances and plays of the festival performance, which lasts through the day and night, are presented to the god as offerings in order to give him pleasure. (Note that this is one possible explanation of the term kagura, 'pleasure of the gods', meaning temple-dances.) At the end of the festival per- formance, the god himself makes his appearance, showing his joy over the festival by a mighty clapping of his jaws and quick movements of his head in an awe-inspiring dance. The rite includes about a dozen different dances. At the end he goes through the whole house, sprinkling water on all sides, the symbol of fertility and life-power. This is to my mind by no means only a rite for preventing fire, as modern commentators believe, but derives from archaic patterns reaching back into a past when man did not even have houses liable to the hazards of fire. What he deeply felt, however, was concern that the power of life flow unhindered through his family and clan as well as through the ani- mals and plants on which he depended for his livelihood.13 The best known animal dance inJapan is the shishimai, usually translated as 'lion dance'. But this term is open to misunderstanding. Shishi signifies any animal with edible meat, and includes therefore the boar and the deer. The lion dance proper originated in India and spread with Buddhism all over Asia. It is to be found in Japan in connection with the Yamabushi ritual and in many other variations, including forms in noh and kabuki Qshakky&amp;, kagami-jishi, renjishi).14 The deer dance, however, even if it goes under the same name, is of a completely different origin. I think it is related to a very archaic culture of hunters with a ritual deer hunt (still performed in the kamisha15 ofSuwa) and deer sacrifices (which can be traced in Suwa, Nikka and Utsunomiya). The center of this culture may have been around the ancient shrines of Katori and Kashima, to the north of Tokyo. The deer dance is still performed in the Kanta area and all the way to the north as far as Iwate and Aomori, where some villages preserve an oral tradition that their ancestors brought this dance from Kashima. An analysis of this dance, which includes about a dozen different numbers, leads to the conclusion that an archaic ritual of nomadic hunters was superseded by a later agricultural influence and, at a still later date, by Buddhistic nembutsu odori. Today the implications of agricultural fertility are prevalent. Another animal dance of great importance is the torimai, the bird dance. Its performance 11 12 _ : 13 Imoos, 'Ein Ritual der Wiedergeburt in den Yamabushi-Kagura', Mitteilungen der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Natur- und Volkerkunde Ostasiens, Tokyo, I968. 14 Honda Yasuji, Dengaku, Fu7ryui, pp. 683 if., 704 if., 9I3 if. 15 _1 )jf</page><page sequence="7">IMMO OS, 'The Birth of the Japanese Theater' 409 comes at the beginning of a ritual. In Japan, as in many other cultures such as Egypt, Greece and Rome, the idea was prevalent that the spirit of a deceased person would take on the form of a bird. In Japan it is the crow which was usually considered the sacred bird in which the spirit of an ancestor lived on. The torimai, therefore, was per- formed at the beginning of the rite in order to call the spirits of the ancestors down to the house or shrine as an invitation to the feast; it served, thus, as a kamioroshi.16 It seems safe to assume that many masks in noh which are used to represent demons or even gods may have developed from archaic animal dances. 3. THEOPHANY IN HUMAN BEINGS. SHAMANISM The back wall of the noh stage, the kagami-ita,17 has as its only decoration the painting of a twisted pine. The original of this tree, the yogomatsu18 or 'shadow-welcoming pine', can still be seen in the compound of the Kasuga shrine in Nara-the shrine which may well be called the birthplace of noh. In ancient times, prior to temples or other structures, the gods were thought to abide in the leaves of mighty trees, the shimboku.19 There they were worshipped in ritual dances and sacrifices. Later on they 'moved' into the shrines, but even now, once a year at matsuri time, they are escorted in a solemn procession from the shrine back to the sacred tree on which they had descended from heaven at a time immemorial. A temporary shrine, the tabisho,20 is erected in front of the tree, dances and plays are performed again in the gods' honor, sacrifices are offered, norito are recited. The archetypal rites are repeated in their pristine beauty and simplicity. Such an event can be witnessed in all its splendor at the matsuri of the Wakamiya Shrine in Nara, when the Komparu school of noh performs dengaku in the shadow of the sacred tree where their art began more than a thousand years ago. Watching the spectacle one can feel the flow of time being arrested. Here again one approaches noh's origins as a religious play very similar to medieval mysteries. I have personally witnessed the very same rites again at a matsuri in a small village in the mountains of Iwate, very much simpler, yet rooted in the same religious belief From the tree, the divine spirit may be transferred to a twig of the sacred sakaki tree, to a wand or pole, or to the bells used in kagura. Fans, too, are often used as a tamashiro or receptacle of the god. Dancers use them at the beginning of a ritual in order to purify the stage, the performers and the audience so as to enable the gods to participate in the feast. Uncleanliness, especially death and blood, would prevent them from attending. Even today performers or groups visited by such a calamity are prevented from per- forming. 16 fT T L.

There is no doubt that here again we arrive at one of the basic elements of the Japanese theater, its roots in the ecstatic techniques of shamanism. The most ancient noh play is 'Okina', derived from the magic ritual of the shushi,21 or magicians, of the Nara period. It is still performed as a rite of good luck and prosperity, especially at the New Year. Dancers have to prepare themselves for this portentous rite by living apart from their families in the gakuya or in the shrine (formerly three weeks), doing their own cooking, and eating special food, thus readying themselves for the descent of the god.22 Even today the noh actor meditates before the mirror in the gakuya (the green room) or before the mask-both of these being the abodes of the gods-in order to absorb the divine powers. There is no doubt that in ancient times the actors did not enter the stage before real ecstasy had been achieved. The ropes surrounding the sacred enclosure may well have had the function of preventing the dancer in his ecstasy from falling off the stage. Ecstatic techniques are still noticeable in kagura and nob. Before the player makes his entry from behind the curtain in the ramabushi-kagura, a fan or wand is lifted above the curtain, clearly a sign destined to attract the divine spirit. When the player enters from behind the curtain he is being helped by two attendants whose assistance may have been very crucial in a state of trance. Music had a great role too in these ecstatic techniques. Hayashi, the present word used for kagura music, derives form hayasu: cheer, applaud, create the right mood by words and music. The drum was the important instrument of the shaman; when he says that he climbs to heaven on a tree, he probably means that the incessant rhythms of the drum, made from a tree, helped him achieve the ecstatic trance in which he is able to make his journey through the universe. In a ramabusbi-kagura troupe the man beating the big drum is still the master, who knows by heart all the rhythms, tunes and texts, the teacher and leader. He speaks the words of the shite, the main actor. He is clearly the ancient shaman, the center of the whole performance. Furthermore, the first words by the chorus are sung behind the curtain, as if they were a spell to create this ecstasy. This is called makudashi, 'sending out from behind the curtain'. Finally, the strange sounds of the musicians during the noh, the kakegoe, seem also rooted in such shamanistic tech- niques. Now, possessed by a god or spirit, the dancer makes his appearance in great, majestic movements or in a whirl of excitement. Even in a modern audience that has gone through all stages of demythologizing enlightenment, one can still feel some of the awe, the supernatural power emanating from this figure in mask and costume. A truly super- human aura surrounds him, and one can well imagine that men in former times were 21 y Ir 22 See Honda Yasuji, Okina sono ta -:a E OD, I Tokyo, I958.</page><page sequence="9">IMMOOS, 'The Birth of the Japanese Theater' 4I1 deeply impressed by this theophany. At many shrines, such as the one at Suwa, the kagura hall is situated right in front of the Raiden, the abode of the god; thus the dancer in the costume of the god could create the impression that he was coming straight from the place where the god usually dwelt. In this context have to be placed all the waki noh or shinno, whose theme is the the- ophany, and another large group in which the spirit of a dead person reappears to voice some grievance before achieving salvation: the mugen noh. The pattern is similar: in the first part, a humble person appears Qsatobito) and is asked by the waki about his story or the story of the place. After telling some ancient myth or tale, he discloses his real identity as god or spirit of someone deceased and offers some advice or teaching and then finishes his argument by a magnificent dance. That they have to be traced to an ancient shamanistic ritual of ecstasis and possession seems quite obvious. The theophany is so much the raison d'etre for this type of play that the shite, who plays the god, alone carries the whole weight of the action. The second player, the waki, offers only a foil for him, posing the right questions to set the action in motion and providing a witness for the action. Let me cite a few examples. In the god plays the main actor often carries a sacred wand, the seat of the god. At the very moment when he lifts it over his head in the dance movement, holding it in both hands, the god is thought to enter his body, taking possession of him. The actor becomes the god. This event is the crucial act in archetypal ritual and the very beginning of the theatrical arts. The identification of the actor with his role is, in spite of all the insistence of the stern, Teutonic schoolmaster Bert Brecht, the very essence of the mysterious power which draws us into the temples of the muses, and the first role played by man was that of a god. The process of a demon taking possession of a person, or rather of a disguised demon revealing his true nature, is acted out most vividly in a long dance, rambyJsbi,23 which forms the core of the play 'D joji'.24 A new temple bell is to be consecrated in a Buddhist monastery. The abbot has strictly forbidden any female to attend the ceremony, because the former bell had been' destroyed by a young girl who, in a frenzy of spurned love, turned into a fiery snake demon who wound herself around the bell under which a monk, the object of her unrequited love, had sought refuge. Thus she burned the bell as well as the unfortunate monk. Now a young woman presents herself at the ceremony, a pro- fessional dancer, and gains admittance when she offers to perform a ritual dance for the festival. She starts with a slow, graceful movement, but little by little the drum rhythms accelerate, the dancer is carried away by a mysterious power, trembling and jerking as if moved by invisible strings, gradually increasing her speed to a frenzied stamping- dance, until suddenly she leaps up into the bell, which them falls over her. After a while she reappears from under the bell in her true form: she is the frightful snake demon. In 23 AL b 24 1f</page><page sequence="10">4I2 Monumenta Nipponica, XXIV, 4 all plays of this type the revelation of the true identity, as god or demon or spirit of a dead person, takes place during the dance in which the drama culminates. The whole structure of the play leads up to this final apogee, and the previous scenes provide the background story needed for the understanding of this supernatural revelation. A fascinating illustration of the process of possession is also furnished in 'Sotoba Komachi',25 one of the oldest noh plays in existence. It tells the legend of a poetess who once had been the most beautiful woman in the capital. Her cruelty had driven her lovers to death. Now she is but an old, crazy beggar, wandering around in destitution and madness. In telling her story to some Buddhist priests, she suddenly is possessed by the avenging spirit of a dead lover, who describes through her own mouth his sufferings and death agony. At the end she is released from this possession by Buddhist magic. The present noh repertoire consists of 233 plays that are still regularly performed. Of these, more than half contain this basic pattern of possession by a spirit or god. This fact should prove beyond doubt the strong impact of the shamanistic tradition on the noh drama. 4. KAGURA I have frequently used the term kagura, or temple dance. Its paramount importance in Shinto ritual as well as its close relation to the birth and development of the Japanese drama actually demands a much more detailed treatment than I can provide in this final section, but I shall limit myself here to a more general sketch. I have already mentioned one possible explanation of the term kagura: 'pleasure of the gods'. I will add just one more: kamikura, or 'god seat', 'dwelling of the gods'.26 Suffice it to say that the performance of the dances is an offering to the gods presented before their holy presence. Much more than verbal prayers, material sacrifices, and lus- trations, these dances forln the very heart of Shinto liturgy. They are prayers acted out in movement. The archaic implications of sympathetic magic and the warding off of evil are still present in many forms, and they are closely tied to the needs and the annual cycle of labors of an agricultural society. Yet this archaic layer is superseded by a more advanced world view, which we can call mythical. The ritual is given a new interpretation based on a more conscious view of man and his surroundings. The gods become more and more anthropomorphic. Man considers himself related to them by ties of blood. He therefore enjoys an intimate con- versation with them. The gods manifest themselves to him in benevolent appearances, they talk to him, and he can tell tales of them-which is the original meaninig of muthein, 25 26 See Honda Yasuji, Kagura V 0, Tokyo, I966. 27 See Karl Kerenyi, Urngang mit Gottlichem, Gottingen, I955.</page><page sequence="11">IMMOOS, 'The Birth of the Japanese Theater' 4I3 muthos.27 Man explains natural phenomena as well as psychological experiences by means of such tales. Kaminari means that the god has spoken in a clap of thunder. When the melting of the snow in one particular spot of a mountainside indicates to the Tahoku farmer that the proper time for sowing has come, he still says that the mountain god, who is a vegetation demon, has given him a signal. He knows that the whole life of nature is dominated by the existence of periodic events, the regular changes of days, months, seasons, and years, which he explains by mythical tales of the death and rebirth of gods. Through seasonal festivals he wants to secure the fixity, the regular repetition of this life cycle on which his entire existence depends, and for this reason he performs dances and plays which represent the ancient tales, the myths. By means of these per- formances he helps the divine powers to carry out their struggle between death and rebirth. These plays also possess an educational function in making the community familiar with their ancient history, with their world view, their theology. The myths include stories of their ancestors, the founding fathers, the culture heroes, etc. They show how man reacts to reality around him. The gods are, in this respect, images of the world as it is mirrored in the mind of man before the birth of rational thinking. This is the background of kagura. The prototype of all mythical dances in Japan is the iwato-biraki dance, the 'opening of the rock-door'. The sun goddess, annoyed by the mischief of her brother Susanoo, retires into a cave, thereby plunging the whole universe into utter darkness. Uzume, the heavenly alarming female, appears before the cave, sur- rounded by many other gods. She wears a head-dress made of tree branches and carries a bundle of bamboo grass and twigs in her hands. She performs a stamping dance on an upturned receptacle used as a sounding board to make it resound as if she were possessed by a deity. Then she turns her performance into an indecent belly dance such as formed part of phallic fertility rites in many archaic cultures.28 Through this ritual dance, the life- and warmth-giving sun was incited to leave her death cave and set the cycle of life into motion again. Every year the kagura is destined to bring this happy event to pass again. The shamanistic context of Uzume's dance is quite obvious: the head-dress and the bundle in her hands, the torimono, we knoNv already as a means of attracting the deity to descend and dwell in it during the ritual dance, and the stamping and thumping on the sounding board was meant to induce the trance. One can notice the important func- tion of the stamping of feet during noh dances. To provide a proper sounding board, the noh stage is fitted with special resonators underneath which convey the vibrations to the earth in order to make it resound and carry further. Once again we have to delve into the shadows of a very archaic past in order to understand the meaning of a present- day convention in Japanese drama. With this situation in mind, the reader will not be 28 For parallels to Uzume's dance see Curt Sachs, World History of the Dance, New York, I93 7, pp.9 oif.</page><page sequence="12">414 Monumenta Nipponica, XXIV, 4 surprised when I mention as a final remark that all performing artists in Japan claim descent from the heavenly dancer Uzume, the first performer of kagura. In Japan, the past is always present, and knowledge of the past enables us to understand the present.</page></plain_text>
