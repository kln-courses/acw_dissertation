<plain_text><page sequence="1">LEONORA WOODMAN ffA Giant on the Horizon": Wallace Stevens and the "Idea of Man" "It is to the hero of midnight that we pray*'1 A PERSISTENT FEATURE OF WALLACE STEVENS'S LATER POETRY IS ITS suggestion of a potential realm of order as yet only dimly apprehended. At times this elusive order seems to embrace the whole of life; at other times, it appears to point particularly to poetry. Often there is the sug- gestion of finality, as if the poet were seeking some fundamental and unalterable substratum of reality governing both life and the poem. Sometimes, Stevens approaches this realm tentatively, using the method of rhetorical questioning that nevertheless asserts the possibility of what it seeks: And in what covert may we, naked, be Beyond the knowledge of nakedness, as part Of reality, beyond the knowledge of what Is real, part of a land beyond the mind ? (CP,252) Elsewhere, modulating into a more assertive declarative mood, Stevens predicts a future "final order," foreseeing "A life beyond this present knowing, / A life lighter than this present splendor."2 This persistent stretching for the elusive "beyond" appears in Ste- vens's search for an "ultimate poem," or a "central poem," or "the poem of pure reality," terms that suggest a potential absolute cleansed of the adventitious and contingent. The significance of this quest is underscored by the complementary theme of disguise - the belief that the true nature of the phenomenal world is veiled and hidden, leading the poet to la- ment that man grasps "never the thing but the version of the thing" (CP, 332), and sending him in quest of the "savage transparence" lying just beyond the "pediment of apearance" (CP, 361). These disconcerting transcendental themes, implying another order of life now but vaguely known, present a formidable problem to the stu- 1 Wallace Stevens, The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens (New York, 1954), p. 466.

On the one hand, Stevens celebrates objective reality and yearns to record it accurately and faithfully, but on the other hand, he appears to suggest another and superior order of reality, leading him to scorn fac- ticity in favor of piercing the "mere objectiveness of things" (CP, 531 ). The demand might be understandable in view of Stevens's lifelong cele- bration of the imagination's metamorphic powers, yet strangely he ap- pears to denigrate both art and imagination as a means of approaching his evanescent realm, insisting that the "poem of pure reality" be sought directly without the aid of mediate forms: "untouched / By trope or deviation" (CP, 471). Indeed, the compelling attractions of "the thing itself" appear to be "Pure coruscations, that lie beyond / The imagina- tion, intact / And unattained" (CP, 349). To explain this difficult feature of Stevens's later poetry, Roy Harvey Pearce has advanced the influential thesis that Stevens's poems are to be regarded as processes revealing the mind in the act of breaking down the commonplace structures of reality. Taking as his cue Stevens's view that "modern reality is a reality of decreation,"3 Pearce suggests that Stevens's "ultimate poem" is merely a "postulate" of the ego, proposing the mind's potential capacity to "annihilate all that's made"4 in order &gt; "to abstract forward, as it were, and to partake, through the abstraction, of its own potentiality to make more poems and to realize itself in all its humanity."5 The "ultimate poem" is thus only a possibility pointing not to any final and conclusive order but to the mind's unceasing effort to touch the rock of selfhood. "The poem is thus the means to moving beyond poetry, beyond illusion, beyond vital assumption, beyond the collectivity of iconic men, to man."6 Pearce has recognized Stevens's instrumental view of poetry, rightly concluding that ultimately men rather than poetry are Stevens's absorb- ing and primary interest. But he has given only a partial account of the assumptions that forced Stevens to adopt such a radical posture. True, Stevens wrote that "the ultimate poem was the mind, / Or of the mind" (CP, 256), thereby internalizing poetry and in effect identifying it with^ mental processes. At the same time, however, he could and did conceive of an ultimate reality that seemed to transcend the mental act, rather startlingly proposing that he sought "a land beyond the mind."

Furthermore, Pearce's thesis, depending as it does on process rather than end, fails to account for the distinct eschatological tone of a good many of the later poems, which either hover around a faintly ascertainable "inherent order active to be / Itself" (CP, 442 ) , or yearn for "a fixed heaven / Not subject to change" (CP, 520), or even predict a "central arrival" (CP, 516). In- deed, there is scarcely a late poem without some suggestion of stasis, often accompanied by expressions of fixity, immobility, and cessation of sound and motion. Stevens's "ultimate poem" is specific and concrete, but its precise meaning is largely obscured by an often arbitrary vocabulary used with little or no consensual sanction. Poetry, I suggest, had a special meaning for Stevens, rather different from what commonly goes by that linguistic symbol; indeed, in Stevens's lexicon "poetry" and the "idea of man" are synonymous, but not for the reasons Pearce suggests. Rather, Stevens believed in the evolution of a qualitatively different man; and because this new man was to appropriate certain powers presently embodied in poetry as poem, Stevens claimed him as the "ultimate poem." The lin- guistic means Stevens used to adapt the word "poetry" to his private pur- pose may be seen in his letters, essays, and the "Adagia," his common- place book, where certain recurring concepts provide the initial textual evidence for my thesis. We can best approach Stevens's "ultimate poem" by seeking the mean- ing of "pure poetry," a phrase that recurs with some frequency in his prose. Early references in several letters of the mid-thirties betray some uneasiness with the phrase. Not only does Stevens use it retrospectively, as if it were a concept once held but since discarded, but he appears to associate it with the first and apparently inferior half of a literature-life dichotomy. Asked by a correspondent whether his Harmonium verse was "essentially decorative," he replies that he was on the point of re- sponding negatively when he remembered his delight during the writing of Harmonium in the sensuous image and the musical phrase: "there was a time when I liked the idea of images and images alone, or images and the music of verse together. I then believed in pure poetry, as it was called."7 However, he continues, "life means a good deal more to us now-a-days than literature does. In the period of which I have just 7 Letters of Wallace Stevens, ed. Holly Stevens (New York, 1966), p. 288. All subsequent references are to this text and will appear in parentheses (L) in the text.</page><page sequence="4">762 LEONORA WOODMAN spoken, I thought literature meant most" (L, 288). Several months later he makes a distinction between "pure poetry" and "didactic poetry" but appears to assume that, while "pure poetry" remains his ultimate objective, "didactic poetry* ' or "didacticism in poetry" is a necessary stage in its evolution (L, 303). By the end of the thirties Stevens's skepticism regarding the appropri- ateness of "pure poetry" seems to have been resolved, for he confidently announces to one correspondent that "I am, in the long run, interested in pure poetry" (L, 340) and writes to another that "pure poetry" should be "the highest objective of the poet" (L, 369). At the same time the phrase crops up in several essays and in glosses to two major poems. In these later references, however, Stevens uses the phrase in a different sense from the one noted above. There, "pure poetry" is dis- cussed in a commonly accepted linguistic context: that is, "pure poetry," however its formal and aesthetic properties may differ from "impure" poetry, designates something that has achieved an objective form. Stev- ens's subsequent references, however, subtly alter this meaning: not only does he refuse to identify "pure poetry" with the affective components of image and music, but he consistently distinguishes it from the poem itself. The distinction may be seen in the gloss Stevens provided in 1940 to section XXII of "The Man with the Blue Guitar" : Poetry is the spirit, as the poem is the body. Crudely stated, poetry is the imagination. But here poetry is used as the poetic, without the slightest pejora- tive innuendo. I have in mind pure poetry. The purpose of writing poetry is to attain pure poetry. (L, 363) What is striking here are the shifting and distinctly different meanings Stevens attaches to poetry. In the first set of equivalencies - poetry = spirit = imagination - the meaning of poetry is internalized, becoming synonymous with an attribute of the human mind - the imagination. In the second set of equivalencies, Stevens departs from grammatical logic to propose that poetry (noun) = poetic (adjective) = pure poetry (adjective, noun). Stevens refuses to locate his evaluative adjective, but clearly he means to establish "poetic" as distinct from either poetry as imagination or poetry as poem. Finally, poetry is used as a referent for the poem, but the process (writing) of poetry is conceived instrumental- ly: that is, one writes poetry to attain pure poetry, an achievement further complicated by the fact that if indeed the "poetic" and "pure poetry" are synonymous, the goal of writing poetry is not the poem but a state produced by the poem. Since Stevens identifies "pure poetry" with the "poetic," our task is</page><page sequence="5">ffA Giant on the Horizon": Wallace Stevens 763 next to trace the word "poetic" to see what can be further established about "pure poetry/' Here we are led to a major Stevensian theme, his eagerness to develop a "theory of poetry " that would expand its relatively narrow, specialized meaning to one embracing the whole of human activity. This is the sense of his proposition that "the theory / Of poetry is the theory of life" (CP, 486). His hope that such a venture would "disclose the truth about poetry" (L, 383) led Stevens in 1940 to urge a wealthy friend to establish a Chair of Poetry at Harvard for the study of "the history of poetic thought and of the theory of poetry" (L, 358) , elaborated in a subsequent Memorandum (L, 377). His proposal clearly relegates poetry as genre to a minor place. A theory of poetry, he writes, should not confine itself to "specimens" of the genre that "are merely parts of a great whole," but should concern itself with the ' 'poetic side of life, of the abstraction and the theory" (L, 383). "It [theory of poetry] does not mean verse any more than philosophy means prose. The subject-matter of poetry is the thing to be ascertained" (L, 377). The distinction between "poetic" and poetry as poem is repeated in the "Adagia": "The poetic view of life is larger than any of its poems (a larger thing than any poem) ; and to recognize this is the beginning of the recognition of the poetic spirit" (OP, 174). Evidently, Stevens re- garded poetry as genre as an instance of a larger principle transcending the literary form. Indeed, he seems to have held an hierarchical view of poetry, according "the poetic view of life" or "pure poetry" a generic status subsuming poetry as poem. Although the "poetic view of life" is still vague (Stevens acknowl- edged that it "sounds rather mussy" [L, 383]), Stevens provides a significant clue when he narrows its appearance in poetry to subject- matter, leading us to consider what he regarded as appropriate content for poetry. Here, the Memorandum may still suffice as text. It appears that the "poetic view of life" that depends on an "abstraction" is related in Stevens's mind to the idea of God, "the major poetic idea in the world" (L, 378). Acknowledging that current skepticism requires some modification of the traditional idea of God, he suggests that "the poetry that created the idea of God will either adapt it to our different intelli- gence, or create a substitute for it, or make it unnecessary" (L, 378) . But in any case, he continues, the idea of God remains the primary "knowl- edge of poetry" (L, 378) as well as of philosophy and science. The idea of God appears, then, to be linked to Stevens's concept of the "poetic" or "pure poetry." Let us investigate the precise relation- ship. Apparently disappointed in his effort to establish the study of the theory of poetry as a scholarly enterprise, Stevens attempted a formula- tion of his own, writing "A Collect of Philosophy" in 1951 as an exam-</page><page sequence="6">764 LEONORA WOODMAN pie of what he meant by the "poetic view of life." Drawing on notes sent him by distinguished friends and a student's handbook of philoso- phy, Stevens sets out in this essay to demonstrate that the philosopher and the poet, however different their method and purpose, often "think alike" (OP, 186) by virtue of the "inherently poetic" ideas they treat - that it is conception rather than form, or idea (abstraction) rather than mode of discourse, that unites two such seemingly contrasting pursuits. No doubt Stevens's reading of philosophy is eccentric (one critic notes that he had "read in almost every modern philosopher and . . . under- stood almost none" ) ,8 but to seek an accurate exposition of philosophical ideas in this essay is to miss Stevens's intent. Stevens is solely interested in developing his notion that the imagination of the philosopher, like the imagination of the poet, contains an innate reservoir of poetic ideas (an "enormous a priori" in the mind, he says, is a potential "poetic . . . concept" [OP, 194]), which compels the loftiest abstractions, chief of which is the idea of God. His purpose is not to argue ontologically for God's existence but rather to illustrate how the idea of God, as a purely psychic phenomenon, has inspired poetic ideas objectified in philosophi- cal systems, and so he reads his philosophers in terms of this overriding objective. Thus, according to Stevens, Leibniz "thought like a poet" (OP, 186) because "Monad by monad ... he achieved God" (OP, 185). Similarly, he reads Schopenhauer's "World as Will" as a "cosmic poem of the ascent into heaven" (OP, 193). Both, it appears, are examples of "ideas that are inherently poetic" (OP, 183) because they agitate the imagination to conceive of an escape from human limitations: "in a system of monads, we come, in the end, to a man who is not only a man but sea and mountain, too, and to a God who is not only all these: man and sea and mountain but a God as well" (OP, 185). "The World as Will" permits a similar escape: "it is precisely the faults of life that this poem enables us to leave behind" (OP, 193). Therefore, if the poem of the ascent into heaven is "unimpeachably divine," it is but a step re- moved from God, "the ultimate poetic idea" (OP, 193 ). Indeed, Stevens clearly identifies poetry with the idea of God unwittingly discovered by the philosopher: Essentially what I intend is that it shall be as if the philosophers had no knowledge of poetry and suddenly discovered it in their search for whatever it is that they are searching for and gave the name of poetry to that which they discovered. Whether one arrives at the idea of God as a philosopher or as a poet matters greatly. (OP, 190) And it is precisely because the idea of God - the supreme abstraction - 8 Joseph N. Riddel, The Clairvoyant Eye (Baton Rouge, La., 1965), p. 37.</page><page sequence="7">rfA Giant on the Horizon": Wallace Stevens "j6^ derives from the imagination rather than from man's logical or cognitive capacities, that Stevens urges the imagination's ascendancy over reason: Does not philosophy carry us to a point at which there is nothing left except the imagination? If we rely on the imagination (or, say, intuition), to carry us beyond that point (as in respect to the idea of God, if we conceive of the idea of God as this world's capital idea), then the imagination is supreme, because its powers have shown themselves to be greater than the powers of reason. (OP, 200) Even the most casual reading of Stevens's prose will reveal how extra- ordinarily drawn he was to the idea of God, yet the significance of this obsessive theme has never been fully appreciated. An aesthetic inter- pretation suggests that it is merely a metaphor for the creative possibili- ties of the imagination and, by synecdoche, of poetry, inasmuch as poetry provides the fulfilling integration - the order, or the search for the ideal - that the idea of God had formerly sustained. Such an interpre- tation seems compelling, given Stevens's hostility to traditional Chris- tianity and his persistent effort to replace religious orthodoxy with some- thing he called poetry. Nevertheless, the evidence appears to indicate otherwise: according to Stevens, the idea of God is an innate constituent of the imagination variously but compellingly objectified not only by the poet but by the philosopher and scientist as well. Any discourse that re- veals the idea of God is, by this definition, "poetry," a word now so broadly conceived as to apply to any number of human pursuits. Stevens's preoccupation with the idea of God as the supreme "poetic idea" accounts for his multiple distinctions for poetry. He distinguishes the "poetic" from the poem qua poem because he wishes to separate form (poetry as genre) from content (poetry as poetic concept), as when he proposes that a poem is composed of "several poetries": "Poetry is a poetic conception, however expressed. A poem is poetry expressed in words. But in a poem there is a poetry of words. Obviously, a poem may consist of several poetries" (OP, 163). The "Adagia" provide another example of this double event in the life of the poem: "Every poem is a poem within a poem: the poem of the idea within the poem of words" (OP, 174). The "poetic conception" and the "poem of the idea" echo the sense of the texts already explored, but another observation, provided in the essay "The Irrational Element in Poetry," clearly indicates that Stevens regarded the "poetic," "pure poetry," and the idea of God as closely related: "... pure poetry is a term that has grown to be descrip- tive of poetry in which not the true subject but the poetry of the subject is paramount. All mystics approach God through the irrational. Pure poetry is both mystical and irrational" (OP, 222).</page><page sequence="8">766 LEONORA WOODMAN Here we move forward considerably. Though Stevens has ostensibly shifted to the poem as artifact, he is in fact still insisting on the poem's doubleness, repeating his view that "pure poetry" arises only when the "poetry of the subject," or the idea of God, is "paramount." It appears, moreover, that the idea of God is an irrational, noncognitive abstraction arising from largely instinctive and unconscious psychic realms. If this is so, and if we take seriously Stevens's belief that the idea of God is an imaginative abstraction that reveals the imagination's supremacy over reason, then we must assume that the imagination is also a largely un- conscious psychic function. A summary will at this point make these relationships clear. We have seen that initially Stevens identified "pure poetry" with the "poetic." The "poetic," as elaborated in the Memorandum and elsewhere, pro- vided this added set of equivalencies: the poetic = poetic view of life = abstraction = subject-matter = idea of God. These equivalencies were repeated in "A Collect of Philosophy," with the addition of the imagi- nation. If, to borrow a Euclidean axiom, things equal to the same thing are equal to each other, then we may conclude that "pure poetry" equals the imagination, the source of the idea of God. Furthermore, it should be stressed that at no point in this examination did Stevens identify "pure poetry" with the poem as objective artifact. When he refers to the poem he either conceives it instrumentally ("the purpose of writing poetry is to attain pure poetry" ), or as an element subordinate to the "poetic view of life," or as a vehicle embodying a "poetic conception." "Pure poetry," according to Stevens's definitions, is consistently inter- nalized, becoming synonymous with a construct of the imagination and eventually with the imagination itself. In 1936 Stevens published his longest poem, "Owl's Clover," and later provided an extensive gloss to the poem in a series of letters to Hi Simons. These glosses provide the fullest explanation of what Stevens meant by "pure poetry," and, accordingly, I turn to them before examin- ing the poem. In his gloss to "The Greenest Continent," the third canto of "Owl's Clover," Stevens has this to say of "pure poetry" : One way of explaining this poem is to say that it concerns the difficulty of imposing the imagination on those that do not share it. The idea of God is a thing of the imagination. We no longer think that God was, but was ima- gined. The idea of pure poetry, essential imagination, as the highest objective of the poet, appears to be, at least potentially, as great as the idea of God, and, for that matter, greater, if the idea of God is only one of the things of the imagination. (L, 369)</page><page sequence="9">ffA Giant on the Horizon": Wallace Stevens 767 Of the unmost significance here is that Stevens is proposing two levels of the imagination in a hierarchy of ascending value. The secondary imagination constructs the myriad ideas of God, each of which convinces the believer of its absolute authority and compels him to reject a different view of the divine. However, as Stevens says here and was often to re- peat, the idea of God is merely a human (imaginative) construct point- ing not to God's objective existence but to a compelling human need to propose an object of veneration. Unfortunately, man has misunderstood this psychic need, converting it into a projected divine image when in reality he alone is the source and object of faith. The proof that the idea of God is merely the "idea of man," Stevens elsewhere says, lies in the fact that an objectified God always assumes an anthropomorphic form: "the gods of Greece are always Greeks and ... all gods are created in the images of their creators" (OP, 211). But in truth the gods are only projections of man's inner life testifying to "the fundamental glory of men and women, who being in need of it create it, elevate it, without too much searching of its identity" (OP, 208). What this perpetual deification points to is not the form itself but the psychic structure that produced it. Man can entertain the idea of God because the image of divinity arises out of inherent qualities of the human mind for which no corresponding objective analogue need be postulated. The "essential imagination" - "pure poetry" - is thus the fountainhead of deity from which all images of diety - shadows of it- self - spring. In the second section of the gloss, Stevens further clarifies the distinc- tion between the "idea of God" and "pure poetry." Since the idea of God, he writes, "partakes of consciousness," it unavoidably embodies extraneous and adventitious elements introduced by self -awareness, and so assumes multiple forms reflecting the peculiarities of race and nation. In contrast, the "essential imagination" is that deeper, irrational God the Father common to all: "This [idea of pure poetry] would be uni- versally true if the imagination was the simple thing that it is commonly regarded as being. However, the imagination partakes of consciousness, and as the consciousness of West (Europe) differs from the conscious- ness of South (Africa), etc., so the imagination of West differs from that of South, and so the idea of God and the idea of pure poetry, etc. differ" (L, 369). This distinction between the two levels of the imagination accounts for Stevens's paradoxical view of divinity, excoriated on the one hand as merely a "postulate of the ego" (OP, 171), and aggrandized on the other as the god within: "God is in me or else is not at all (does not exist)" (OP, 172). The first proposition rejects the spurious objectified</page><page sequence="10">768 LEONORA WOODMAN phantasies of the secondary imagination in favor of the inner "essential imagination" - man himself. The process by which Stevens arrived at this conclusion is given quasi-syllogistic form in the "Adagia": "Propo- sita: 1. God and the imagination are one. 2. The thing imagined is the imaginer. The second equals the thing imagined and the imaginer are one. Hence, I suppose, the imaginer is God" (OP, 178). Stevens's reluctance to identify "pure poetry" with poetry as poem is now understandable. "Pure poetry," or the "essential imagination," can- not be poetry as object but must be poetry as subject: man himself is "pure poetry" because his unconscious "essential imagination" that pro- duces the "idea of God" is itself the prototype of all the gods. The need is thus to divert man from worshipping the "fictions" created by his imagination to worshipping the imagination itself . But, as Stevens ad- mits, this has "its difficulties." Logically, he writes, he "ought to believe in essential imagination" divested of all symbolic representations (log- ically, of course, the unconscious is a ding-an-sich that cannot be ob- jectified), but since "it is easier to believe in a thing created by the imagination" (L, 370), he will offer a substitute "fiction" to represent the "essential imagination." This substitute "fiction," Stevens writes, is the mythological Ananke, mankind's "common god," introduced at the end of the third canto of "Owl's Clover": Yet, the poem concludes with what is its point, that, if ideas of God are in conflict, the idea of pure poetry: imagination, extended beyond local con- sciousness, may be an idea to be held in common by South, West, North and East. It would be a beginning, since the heaven in Europe is empty, to recog- nize Ananke, who, now more than ever, is the world's Starless crown.' (L, 370) In the final gloss to "The Greenest Continent," Stevens writes that Ananke symbolizes the "essential imagination," that he is a substitute for the God that has been abjured, belief being necessary, and that he is a form of the fiction with which Stevens was grappling at the time ( 1940 ) the gloss was written (L, 370 ) . It is my view that Ananke, Stevens's explicit symbol for the primary "essential imagination," represents the single, most important element of Stevens's thought and that without a thorough grasp of his signifi- cance a good part of the poetry will be largely misunderstood. This is not to say that this mythic figure receives extensive and explicit attention in the poetry. Indeed, apart from "Owl's Clover," Ananke appears in his specific form only twice, first in a cryptic parable of "Like Decora- tions in a Nigger Cemetery," published in the 1935 Ideas of Order, and</page><page sequence="11">rfA Giant on the Horizon": Wallace Stevens 769 later in an excised stanza intended for "Examination of the Hero in a Time of War," a poem that appeared in the 1942 Parts of a World. Nevertheless, Ananke casts his shadow over a major portion of Stevens's creative life. The textual examples provided were written over a period of some sixteen years, yet they exhibit a remarkable uniformity in language and conception. Stevens's insistence on more than one kind of poetry, his re- peated use of "poetic conception," "poetic ideas," "poetic view of life," his recurring attraction to the idea of God, all serve to make these ob- servations timeless, so that violating his chronology does not distort his meaning. Consequently, when an investigation of "pure poetry" leads ultimately to Ananke, clearly identified as "pure poetry" and said to be "the highest objective of the poet," we may safely conclude that Ananke is the presiding assumption of Stevens's later efforts to define this im- portant concept. There is further reason to insist on Ananke's importance. It is ap- parent that Stevens's use of the word "poetry" is decidedly various, bearing in its ultimate sense - "pure poetry" - only a tangential relation- ship to poetry as artifact. In this connection, Stevens's identification of "pure poetry" with Ananke casts considerable doubt on many of the assumptions that have governed the criticism of Stevens's poetry. I have noted that Stevens's proposition that "the theory / Of poetry is the theory of life" is closely linked to his concept of "pure poetry." If indeed this belief is a central and informing doctrine in the poetry, then it would appear that Stevens's poems are primarily concerned with Ananke and only peripherally concerned with aesthetics (aesthetics is a minor con- cern, as I shall shortly note). Furthermore, without explicitly acknowl- edging that Ananke is the fiction with which he is currently preoccu- pied, Stevens nevertheless implies in his gloss that Ananke is a form of the fiction. The consequences of this admission are again significant, inasmuch as Stevens's "supreme fiction" is another poetic theme that spans a considerable portion of his poetic career. Finally, there is good reason to believe, given Stevens's lexical arbitrariness, that when he uni- versalizes poetry by suggesting that it is to supplant religion ("Poetry / Exceeding music must take the place / Of empty heavens and its hymns" [CP, 167]), or when he particularizes it as his poetic subject ("Poetry is the subject of the poem" [CP, 176]), he is not talking about an art form at all but is referring to the deification of man's unconscious life - the "ultimate poem" - which is to supplant the obsolete idea of God. This may be illustrated more precisely. In "Sombre Figuration," the final canto of "Owl's Clover," Stevens</page><page sequence="12">770 LEONORA WOODMAN introduces an Ananke surrogate, a shadowy "subman" who is clearly a symbol of the subterranean collective unconscious said to be eternal and absolute: There is a man whom rhapsodies of change, Of which he is the cause, have never changed And never will, a subman under all The rest, to whom in the end the rest return, The man below the man below the man, Steeped in night's opium, evading day. (OP, 66) Now, if Ananke represents the "essential imagination" subsuming the secondary imagination that * 'partakes of consciousness," then plainly he and the subman are identical forces intended to represent the archaic contents of man's racial memory. This is what Stevens says of his "sub- man" in the gloss to "Sombre Figuration": The sub-conscious is assumed to be our beginning and end (1). It follows that it is the beginning and end of the conscious. Thus, the conscious is a lesser thing than the sub -conscious. The conscious is, therefore, inadequate. In another note I said that the imagination partakes of the conscious. Here it is treated as an activity of the sub-conscious: the imagination is the sub- conscious. (L, 373) The importance of this gloss is not merely that Stevens identifies his Ananke-subman with the collective unconscious (subconscious) but that he invests him with eschatological significance. If the subconscious is that fundamental psychic stratum that inspires the "lesser" secondary imagination, then it and not its shadow is the master of man's psychic life, destined eventually to reassert its hegemony. In short, Ananke is the goal of human aspiration: "our beginning and end." When Stevens, therefore, writes that the "purpose of writing poetry is to attain pure poetry," we can only assume that Ananke and not the poem is the terminus ad quern of the poetic act. Roy Harvey Pearce has observed of Stevens's late poems that "poetry, in being poetry, manifests the existence of a poetry beyond poetry."9 Precisely. If man's Ananke-subconscious is "pure poetry," then it is towards Ananke as a principle of being that all human ob j edifications (projections of Ananke) strive and yearn. It is not merely that Ananke inspires all human endeavor but that all human endeavor actively strains to realize Ananke as a principle of life. We write poetry because we are compelled to express our desire to be Ananke, an assumption that led Stevens to the conclusion that a theory o Pearce, p. 413.</page><page sequence="13">rrA Giant on the Horizon": Wallace Stevens 771 of poetry that would account for Ananke's preeminence would also be a "theory of life/' For these reasons, I regard "Owl's Clover," the poem in which Ananke receives his fullest elaboration, as the central poem in Stevens's canon. Critical opinion largely disclaims this view. According to Merle Brown, the poem is "the one major betrayal of his [Stevens's] poetic genius."10 Joseph Riddel and Louis Martz take the more charitable view that the poem is a transitional piece marking an unfortunate excursion into the ideological arena from which Stevens was to escape both styl- istically and conceptually in his following poem, "The Man with the Blue Guitar."11 That Stevens's poetic idiom changed cannot be gainsaid, but that his subject changed from the "mystique of a universal self" to "the poet singular as earthly leader" is questionable.12 In my view, "Owl's Clover" not only provides the theoretical justification for the "idea of man" that Stevens was to elaborate in "The Man with the Blue Guitar" and subsequent poems, but also candidly reveals why Stevens gave the imagination such central significance in his art. "Owl's Clover" is a visionary poem, as William Van O'Connor has correctly noted.13 The word "future" appears twelve times, and where explicit statement will not do Stevens resorts to the futurelike infinitive "to be" or the predictive modal auxiliary "would be" to prefigure a vision that seems imminent but as yet inaccessible.14 Moreover, the poem 10 Merle E. Brown, Wallace Stevens (Detroit, 1970), p. 90. n Riddel, p. 135. Louis Martz, "The World as Meditation,'' The Poem of the Mind (New York, 1969), p. 208. Critics are divided on the merits of "Owl's Clover." William Van O'Connor sees the poem as "one of the best long poems in English published during the first half of the twentieth century" {The Shap- ing Spirit [New York, 1964], p. 60). Less lavish but nonetheless positive is Henry Wells's judgment that the poem is "one of the most rewarding flights of Stevens' art" {Introduction to Wallace Stevens [Bloomington, Ind., 1964], p. 195). In contrast, Louis Martz regards the poem as unsuccessful, often depending on "a rhetoric of empty assertion" (p. 210). Joseph N. Riddel and Helen Vendler have provided the fullest exegeses, but for neither is the poem successful. Vendler finds its basic style "florid," its concepts "squeamish," its language "notably strained" and often "verbally intolerable," the poem of a man "embarrassed by his own rhetorical excesses." She concludes that the social theme of "Owl's Clover" was unsuited to Stevens's poetic talent {On Extended Wings [Cambridge, Mass., 1969], chap. 4). Riddel also sees the poem as a failure, "contentiously defensive, impenetrably opaque, and gracelessly hortatory," concluding that at this moment in his career Stevens did not have the "political acumen" to under- stand the point at which poetry had to divorce itself from ideological controversy (P. 134). 12 Riddel, p. 136. 13 O'Connor, p. 64. 14 Stevens s preoccupation with the future appears frequently in the poetry.

Indeed, there is a persistent oracular quality about the poem that leads one to suspect that it is intended as a testament of faith. Inspired by a Marxist critic's charge that Ideas of Order had failed to concern itself with the grave social and economic issues of the depression, "Owl's Clover" is Stevens's testimony that he was indeed concerned but that his concern and his solution were of an altogether different order.15 Consequently, he refused to acknowledge his critic's assumptions that man's malaise stemmed from social and economic dislocations that the socially committed poet was morally bound to note and treat, and pro- posed instead that man's difficulties were to be traced to a far more archetypal event for which contemporary problems were but instances. That event, in Stevens's mind, was closely related to the origin and func- tion of art; hence, each of the five cantos hovers around a ring of white, , marble horses, a central symbol sometimes intended as a symbol for art. Ananke, however, is Stevens's principal subject; this important per- sonification of the "essential imagination" provides the key to the whole of "Owl's Clover." Most critics, misled perhaps by Ananke's mytho- logical original, have seen him as an external God, "an utterly objective, transcendental force."16 Precedent exists of course for such an interpre- ■- tation. The inflexible order Ananke (a female divinity) represents in Parmenides and Plato suggests a transcendent, immutable world of Being distinct from the sensible and transitory world of human experience. However, W. K. C. Guthrie reminds us that early natural philosophers often associated the principle of necessity with the concept of p hy sis: Physis in the eyes of these men is a natural necessity inherent in each separate thing or substance, not a law of interaction between them. With each thing moving as its own physis dictates, the clashes between them will be fortuitous though caused by necessity.17 In this sense Ananke is the personification of an internal principle of necessity compelling the organism to assert its inexorable nature. Clearly, Stevens intends his Ananke to symbolize an internal force, a 15 Stanley Burnshaw, "Turmoil in the Middle Ground," New Masses, 17 (Octo- ber, 1935), 41-42. Apparently dissatisfied with "Owl's Clover," Stevens dras- tically revised it for its reappearance in The Man with the Blue Guitar and sub- sequently dropped it from his Collected Poems on the grounds that it was "too rhetorical."

Predictably, he appears at the end of a canto whose focus is Africa. As the "Sultan of African sultans," Ananke represents the primitive and savage energy of man's instinctive life, revealed in the half -brute "jaguar-men" and "lion-men" who populate the primeval jungles of "The Greenest Continent." Predictably, too, the canto focuses on the idea of God, beginning with a rhetorical question on the nature of divine hegemony eventually answered in the minatory and aggressive declaratives signalling Ananke' s appearance: Large-leaved and many-footed shadowing, What god rules over Africa, what shape, What avuncular cloud-man beamier than spears? (OP, 52) Fatal Ananke is the common god. (OP, 59) Sultan of African sultans, starless crown. (OP, 60) Ananke certainly satisfies all the requirements of divinity: he is al- mighty, ominiscient and eternal, totally without human frailty and in- vulnerable to human desire. Much like the sovereign God of Stevens's Protestant forebears, Ananke sits in "ether flamed" (OP, 59), an "un- merciful pontifex" (OP, 60) whose "ubiquitous will" (OP, 59) directs human destiny. This universal god of Africa subsumes the myriad tran- sitory gods worshipped in his name: He is that obdurate ruler who ordains For races, not for men, powerful beyond A grace to nature, a changeless element. (OP, 59) Evidently Stevens believed in an original and powerful substratum of the human psyche that he thought once enjoyed total hegemony. The "essential imagination" represents not only the universal or archetypal imagination, as some commentators have noted, but a unified condition of life antedating the development of consciousness. Ananke is the vesti- gial memory of that former life, arising when human consciousness severed man's organic ties. As a result, man assuaged his loneliness and fear by inventing compensatory gods, but in reality those gods are merely Ananke's voice in another guise expressing man's sense of loss. Conse- quently, Stevens hammers at epithets of estrangement: Fateful Ananke is the final god. His hymn, his psalm, his cithern song of praise</page><page sequence="16">774 LEONORA WOODMAN Is the exile of the disinherited, Life's foreigners, pale aliens of the mud. (OP, 59) Ananke is both an echo of man's paradisal past now buried in his racial unconscious and a harbinger of his future, for he represents the principle of memory viable enough to produce in man's consciousness "remembrances" of original innocence: He dwells below, the man below, in less Than body and in less than mind, ogre, Inhabitant, in less than shape, of shapes That are dissembled in vague memory Yet still retain resemblances, remain Remembrances, a place of a field of lights. (OP, 67) Ananke is the force that agitates the imagination to retrieve its lost paradise. A portent of the future introduced in the final canto illustrates Stevens's regressive hopes. Said to be inspired by the "subman" ("an image of his making'1 [OP, 69]), the portent is a Janus image, em- bodying both past and future, memory and time to come: The portent may itself be memory; And memory may itself be time to come And memory's lord is the lord of prophecy. (OP, 70) Stevens's gloss to this passage further emphasizes his conviction that mankind's future is closely tied to the contents of the collective uncon- scious: "The future must bear within it every past, not least the pasts that have become submerged in the sub-conscious, things in the experi- ence of races" (L, 373). From the belief that man's unconscious prods him to recapture a past condition of life, it is but a step to the further belief that man's imagina- tive constructions - his art and myth - objectify such yearnings. Stevens believed that man's expressive need and religious sentiment (the two are really one) arose only after the birth of consciousness, impelled by man's consequent sense of isolation and solitariness. However, the imagi- native constructions arising from these needs are derivative, originating in the reduced but germinal seeds of memory incubating in the sub- conscious. Thus art and myth have a single source of inspiration - vestigial memory, or Ananke:</page><page sequence="17">ffA Giant on the Horizon": Wallace Stevens 775 He thinks of the noble lives Of the gods and, for him, a thousand litanies Are like the perpetual verses in a poet's mind. (OP, 59) Therefore, the ubiquitous statue of "Owl's Clover" is said to be "A ring of horses rising from memory" (OP, 57) and is directly attributed to Ananke's importunacy: "He, only, caused the statue to be made, / And he shall fix the place where it will stand" (OP, 60). Since Ananke is a dynamic symbol important for the change he pre- sages and initiates, the art that incarnates his image is equally an instru- ment of change. Hence, the statue of "Owl's Clover" in some instances represents man's redemptive imagination - the role Stevens assigned to the constructs of the secondary imagination. Art functions in this manner because it is animated by an idea of God (actually the idea of man) that agitates and revives a corresponding idea in the mind of its audi- ence. Consequently, each imaginative construct has extraordinary signifi- cance, for behind its plastic or verbal facade lies the compelling Ananke- musician whose music "mimics" man's inner life: He turns us into scholars, studying The masks of music. We perceive each mask To be the musician's own and, thence, become An audience to mimics glistening With meanings, doubled by the closest sound, Mimics that play on instruments discerned In the beat of the blood. (OP, 67) Consequently, art has a job to do. It is functional rather than decorative, instructive rather than merely entertaining, the initially necessary but ultimately dispensable means of reawakening the "child asleep in its own life" (OP, 104).18 Its instrumental function is clearly defined in the body of the poem. "Owl's Clover" opens with a description of a ring of white, winged, marble horses arrested in mid-flight. Forelegs taut, bodies "contorted," 18 Such an assertion must sound strange indeed to those accustomed to thinking of Stevens as the supreme aesthetician. While Stevens often said that the poet had no moral or social obligation of an immediate sort, he did note that the "imagination and society are inseparable," and went on to repeat in the essay quoted here the same identity between poetry and life that I have noted is the basis for his belief in the supremacy of Ananke: "I do not think that a poet owes any more as a social obligation than he owes as a moral obligation. . . .

But it</page><page sequence="18">776 LEONORA WOODMAN poised for the "vivid plunge/1 the horses are charged with an extra- ordinary vigor on the point of exploding into motion. The image is an appropriate one, for Stevens means the statue to represent man's Ananke temporarily imprisoned in the lifeless artifact. Its dynamism, however, expresses the latent power of man's unconscious straining for the leap that is to assure Ananke's hegemony. Immediately after this description, Stevens introduces an Old Woman, a strange and haggard figure who represents man's current estrangement from his Ananke and his con- sequent sense of desolation. She is, however, searching for an alternative, which finds its focus in the "atmosphere" generated by the statue, but it is only after the statue's strange and sudden collapse that she experiences it as an exact duplication of her own agitations: "A change so felt, a fear in her so known, / Now felt, now known as this" (OP, 45 ) . The Old Woman's sudden recognition at once inspires images of in- flation: her mind, "magnified," (OP, 45) blends with night, and night itself loses its "common shape" (OP, 45) to become the prototype of night. The implications of the Old Woman's transformation are visual: somehow, as a consequence of her experience with the collapsed statue, her mind has been purged of some dross or refractory material, permit- ting her to retrieve a primary reality: "It was as if transparence touched her mind" (OP, 45). Stevens prepares us for the Old Woman's transformation through the incremental repetition of "black" and the destruction of the statue, both of which can be understood only in the context of his apotheosis of the collective unconscious. Stevens consistently uses black and its temporal analogue night to characterize his Ananke-subman-portent: the "dark- skinned" Ananke-serpent presides over Stevens's restored primitive para- dise, "the black sublime" (OP, 55) ; the "subman" is "Steeped in night's opium" (OP, 66); the form his portent takes "bears all darkness in its bulk" (OP, 68). The final gloss to "Sombre Figuration" explicitly iden- tifies night with the subconscious: "as the portent sank in the night of the sub-conscious, the night in which the trees were full of farewells became the perennial night of the sub-conscious" (L, 375). Therefore, when Stevens writes that the Old Woman's "musty mind / Lay black and full of black misshapen" (OP, 44) and that her alteration in the wake of the statue's collapse takes the form of unity with night, he is not a social obligation. One does not love and go back to one's ancient mother as a social obligation. One goes back out of a suasion not to be denied" (NA, 27-28). If Ananke is indeed life, then poetry is the agent that produces life, as Stevens implied when he said that "the purpose of writing poetry is to attain pure poetry."</page><page sequence="19">trA Giant on the Horizon": Wallace Stevens 77 7 intends to affirm the latent power of the subconscious eventually asserting its supremacy. The collapse of the statue also follows logically from Stevens's psy- chological assumptions. Stevens insists that the "atmosphere" of the statue corresponds to the "atmosphere" of the Old Woman's "musty mind" because he wishes to stress the abstraction embedded in the statue. He assumes that Ananke is the animating principle of art, but art is only incidental to Ananke. Indeed, art is only a kind of allegory - the "pinch- ings of an idea" (CP, 276) - representing once removed the splendors of man's original divinity. True, its function is initially necessary: as paradigm it incarnates, however faintly, man's original perfection; as catalyst, it impels the psychological transformation necessary for retrieval. Once it initiates the reconciliation of man to his Ananke, however, it loses its efficacy and rationale, collapsing to "marble hulk." Thus, the collapse of the statue in the fourth section of the first canto merely presages its unique resurrection in the fifth section, for its de- struction marks the annihilation of art and the beginning of human renewal. Characteristically turning to the future, Stevens predicts a state "beyond imagined trees" in which "the horses would rise again" (OP, 46), this time not as a symbol of incipient and unconsummated power arrested in the static artifact, but as living beings finally capable of flight. The horses "Would flash in air" (OP, 46), their hoofs would grind, their muscular bodies strain, until all would explode into motion as "The light wings lifted through the crystal space / Of night" (OP, 46). No longer imprisoned in the cold and inanimate marbles of man's imagina- tive surrogates, the horses, vivid examples of Stevens's belief that "the theory / Of poetry is the theory of life," are now symbols of liberated mankind. The splendid powers of Ananke formerly projected onto the artifact have been redeemed; art has yielded to experience; and man himself is now the "ultimate poem." The second canto, "Mr. Burnshaw and the Statue," in revised form entitled "The Statue at the World's End," further develops Stevens's regressive cosmology. This time the statue is the symbol of a moribund civilization, part of an "immense detritus" (OP, 49) to be swept aside in favor of "a hopeful waste to come" (OP, 49). But first its former powers must be exorcised; once a symbol of the viable artistic artifact, the statue is now an incubus discouraging the full maturation of man's inner life. Thus Stevens's mordant tone, the acrimony and contempt with which he speaks of art. The statue is, he writes, a paltry thing con- cocted by an artist-cook "that never rode the back / Of his angel through the skies" (OP, 46). Continuing, he flays the statue as the product of insignificant men - "moonlight muckers" (OP, 46) who fashioned</page><page sequence="20">778 LEONORA WOODMAN "crepuscular images" (OP, 46) as surrogates for "a life they never lived" (OP, 46). The horses "should go clattering" (OP, 47 ), infinitely nobler in life than as the frozen mementoes of "the sculptor's foppish- ness" (OP, 47). Indeed, the statue is the product of man's "dank imagination" (OP, 47), as "idea" considerably inferior to the original instinctive life it represents: much below Our crusted outlines hot and huge with fact, Ugly as an idea, not beautiful As sequels without thought. (OP, 47) The destruction of the statue is completed in a dance of exorcism per- formed by a group of "celestial paramours" whose dual function is to destroy the old order and usher in the new. Hence, they chant "sibilant requiems" (OP, 47) while performing a "ballet infantine" (OP, 47), meanwhile turning their backs on the statue now characterized as an "ef- figy" (OP, 47). Foretelling a new day "Astral and Shelleyan" (OP, 47 ) , the dancers slowly circle the statue, symbolically enacting the trans- ference of art into life; and as they circle, the exchange takes place: "the statue falls, / The heads are severed, topple, tumble, tip" (OP, 51), and men become "marble men" (OP, 52) , appointing to themselves the power of their artifacts. The epitaph inscribed on the statue once and for all removes art from the realm of human experience: The stones That will replace it shall be carved, f The Mass Appoints These Marbles Of Itself To Be Itself.' No more than that, no subterfuge, No memorable muffing, bare and blunt. (OP 48 ; Stevens's italics) Between exorcism and annunciation Stevens predicts a modern Go- morrah called "the end of the world" (OP, 49) . It appears that not only must man's art be destroyed to pave the way for Stevens's "new reality," but so too must all the earmarks of his present culture. Thus, the world is reduced to a "trash can" (OP, 49) ; buzzards feed on the carrion of rich and poor alike; both sculptor and statue lie decapitated among the debris. Having treated man in his fallen state (the metaphor of the Fall is of course naturalistically rather than Christologically defined) and his con- sequent redemptive struggle given form and focus in the statue, Stevens turns in his third and central poetic sequence, "The Greenest Conti- nent," to Africa, the symbol for mankind's original paradise. Here man</page><page sequence="21">"A Giant on the Horizon": Wallace Stevens 779 is ruled by the natural god of the instinctive self rather than by the arti- ficial gods who "partake of consciousness'* : That was never the heaven of Africa, which had No heaven, had death without a heaven, death In a heaven of death. (OP, 54) The incremental repetition of "death" and heaven" modulates from denial to affirmation, from duality to unity. In the first three instances "heaven" carries the traditional meaning of an afterlife. Such a heaven is absent in Africa. The feral and mindless "jaguar-men" and "lion- men" who populate its jungles are free of the idea of death and there- fore experience "death without a heaven." But this is their greatest virtue: paradoxically, to be without an idea of death is to live in a "heaven of death." The abstract heaven once posed as a superior, extraterrestrial realm thus modulates in Stevens's final context into a natural heaven, heavenly precisely because man capitulates to mortality entirely free of the fear introduced by self -awareness. Such a heaven deifies no abstract, external god - "Death, only, sits upon the serpent throne" (OP, 55). The "black sublime" of Africa is twice invaded in the course of the canto, once by the missionary "angels" of Europe who would impose their idea of God as mythology, once by the statue of Europe, which would impose its idea of God as aesthetic artifact. Neither survives. The missionaries return to "their tabernacles" (OP, 55), the statue to the "northern sky" (OP, 54). Twice return- ing to the subject of art, Stevens asks whether the statue could sur- vive in primitive Africa, only to confirm the hostility of the earlier can- tos. If it were indeed possible for the statue to arise in Africa, it would be quickly destroyed by man's serpent- Ananke, who has no need of it.19 Only where human life is characterized by a cultivated consciousness does it become necessary to project the idea of God in an artifact: If the statue rose, If once the statue were to rise, if it stood, Thinly, among the elephantine palms, Sleekly the serpent would draw himself across. The horses are part of a northern sky Too starkly pallid for the jaguar's light. (OP, 54) "A Duck for Dinner," the fourth and most explicitly social canto, addresses itself to the twin themes of change and the future, in both of 19 The serpent, a common symbol of the unconscious, is identified with Ananke in "Like Decorations in a Nigger Cemetery" (CP, 152).</page><page sequence="22">78O LEONORA WOODMAN which the artist and his artifact have a significant and central function. Here, however, Stevens's revolutionary ardor is tempered, his mood evolutionary rather than apocalyptic. Confident that in contrast to social- istic ideology - a "Profound / Abortion' ' (OP, 62) - the future prom- ised by Ananke had universal validity, Stevens constructs his version of "everyman . . . rapt round / By dense unreason" (OP, 62) whom he sees rising "inch / By inch, Sunday by Sunday, many men" (OP, 60). His masses act in concert, obedient to their Ananke who guarantees their psychic unity and identity of purpose: Is each man thinking his separate thoughts or, for once, Are all thinking together as one, thinking Each other's thoughts, thinking a single thought, Disclosed in everything, transcended, poised For the syllable, poised for the touch ? (OP, 62) While Stevens believes in universal change, he is yet doubtful about the capacity of "this mob" (OP, 63) to effect change without the dy- namic leadership of an authoritative figure - a "super-animal" who is to "dictate our fates." The man most likely to fulfill this function, it ap- pears, is the orator-poet, upon whom the "future depends" : What man of folk-lore shall rebuild the world, What lesser man shall measure sun and moon, What super-animal dictate our fates? It may be the future depends on an orator. (OP, 63) The language used here is instructive. Ananke, it will be recalled, wields absolute power: he is "fatal" and "fateful," our death and destiny. The "super-animal," then, cannot be other than Ananke in the guise of his most sensitive agent, the orator-poet.20 Hence, Stevens apotheosizes the 20 The image of the "super-animal" is a significant one, recalling the "lion-men" and "jaguar-men" who populate Africa, Stevens's primeval paradise. In his gloss to this passage Stevens frees his "super- animal" from human contingency: he is "inhuman" and "without any of our weaknesses" (L, 372). This Janus-image, simultaneously suggesting primitive strength and human transcendence, crops up in the essay "The Figure of the Youth as a Virile Poet," where Stevens describes the poet of the future as "still half -beast and somehow more than human" (NA, 52). His modernity, however, is characteristically anchored to the past, for he still bears "the antique imagination of the father" (NA, 52-53). The image recurs in one of Stevens's hero poems published in 1942: A wider brow, large and less human Eyes and bruted ears: the man-like body</page><page sequence="23">"A Giant on the Horizon": Wallace Stevens 781 poet in much the same hyperbolic rhetoric reserved for Ananke. Embody- ing sexual energy, tribal authority, and Erde mystique, the poet is a vatic figure whose clairvoyant eye discerns the shape of things to come: Don Juan turned furious divinity, Ethereal compounder, pater patriae, Great mud-ancestor, 002er and Abraham, Progenitor wearing the diamond crown of crowns, He from whose beard the future springs, elect. (OP, 64) Since the poet's special task is to erase the legacy of estrangement by uniting man to "the man below," he is indeed a figure of enormous pres- tige, like Ananke worthy of being crowned with the royal diadem. Not surprisingly, Stevens addresses him as "Great mud-ancestor, oozer and Abraham," deliberately regressive images recalling the Ananke-god who arose when man became a "pale alien of the mud." For the artist, Anan- ke's most sensitive instrument, provides the articulated link between man and his original paradise. The statue serves a similar instrumental function. More than an arti- fact designed to give aesthetic pleasure, it rather objectifies the aspira- tions of man's instinctive life, focusing in an explicit image of the idea of God what had previously rested on the threshold of consciousness. To its observers, it reflects: The metropolitan of mind, they feel The central of the composition, in which They live. They see and feel themselves, seeing And feeling the world in which they live. (OP, 64) Predictably, the statue adumbrates the future appearance of "another race, / Above our race, yet of ourselves transformed" (OP, 64). Art, Of a primitive. He walks with a defter And lither stride. His arms are heavy And his breast is greatness. (CP, 277) Images of magnitude and transcendence, conveyed in terms like "prodigious," "inhuman," and "more than human human," are frequently repeated in poems dealing with Stevens's giant-hero like "Gigantomachia" (1947), "Chocorua to Its Neighbor" (1947), and "A Primitive like an Orb," (1948). Indeed, Stevens's "super-animal" bears a marked resemblance to his hero and both, it appears from a late letter to Renato Poggioli, are linked to his "supreme fiction": If we are to think of a supreme fiction, instead of creating it, as the Greeks did, for example, in the form of a mythology, we might choose to create it in the image of a man: an agreed-on superman. (L, 789)</page><page sequence="24">782 LEONORA WOODMAN indeed, is Stevens's intermediate version of the Incarnation. As man's inner divine life objectified, its effect is no less than human purification: it spiritualizes the race.21 I use the term "intermediate" deliberately, for Stevens is clearly un- easy about art. On the one hand, art is a necessary aid to human renewal, promising the restored vigor of the primary imagination. On the other, however, art represents a deterioration of man's former life. At best it is a surrogate for the paradisal home, at worst, a barrier, since it provides an outlet for a sense of divinity that man seems content to objectify rather than to experience. This is why Stevens both exalts and excoriates the artist and his artifact, why he simultaneously elevates the shaping pow- ers of art and denigrates its linguistic and metaphoric powers. When the first consideration is uppermost, Stevens asssigns the poet extraordinary powers and accords his fiction a high priority in human life. It appears, however, that the poet's task is not aesthetic fulfillment but qualitative change: Suppose the poet discovered and had the power thereafter at will and by in- telligence to reconstruct us by his transformations. He would also have the power to destroy us. If there was, or if we believed that there was, a center, it would be absurd to fear or to avoid its discovery. (NA, 45) When, however, Stevens wished to paint the attractions of his "new reality," he grew impatient with poetry, demanding "the thing itself" freed from the "evasions" of metaphor, or he insisted on "a land beyond the mind," a "bare reality," and eventually on the "ultimate poem." Such demands called for the annihilation of art; the reality Stevens sought could be satisfied only by dissolving the distinction between life and art, subject and object. Stripped of consciousness and returned to nature, man himself was to be the "ultimate poem," supplanting the cultural 21 Stevens's view of the function of art strikingly parallels Jung's aesthetic formulations, but it would be difficult to suggest a direct influence. There is evi- dence that Stevens's interest in the racial unconscious antedates the work of Jung (see L, 136). Nor does Stevens mention Jung in either his letters or his essays. However, Jung's conviction that the highest art is impersonal in origin and social in end offers an illuminating gloss to Stevens's own certainties. Briefly, Jung maintained that visionary art derives from a timeless, autonomous, suprapersonal primordial archetype that activates a similar archetype in the collective psyche. Functioning compensatorily, the archetype inspires a "participation mystique" enabling "us to find our way back to the deepest springs of life" ("On the Rela- tion of Analytical Psychology to Poetry," the Spirit in Man, Art and Literature [Princeton, 1966], p. 74). See also his "Psychology and Literature" in the same volume. Stevens's apotheosis of the unconscious as the source and end of man's religious sentiment also parallels Jung's investigation of the "numinous" experi- ence, similarly attributed to a quasi-divine self. See Carl Gustav Jung, Psychology and Religion (New Haven, 1938).</page><page sequence="25">tfA Giant on the Horizon": Wallace Stevens 783 object with unmediated, spontaneous experience. Thus Stevens could en- vision a "land beyond the mind" while claiming that the "ultimate poem was the mind / Or of the mind" without contradiction. The first demand seeks to transcend the spurious accretion of consciousness, while the sec- ond celebrates the prerational "essential imagination." And since the "essential imagination" is, in Stevens's view, the only authentic poetry, he is forced to concede that the poetry he sought was unamenable to arti- f actual shape: The demand for reality in poetry brings one sooner or later to a point where it becomes almost impossible since a real poetry, that is to say, a poetry that is not poetical or that is not merely the notation of objects in them- selves poetic is a poetry divested of poetry. (L, 631) An entry in the "Adagia" reads "Poetry is a cure of the mind" (OP, 176), a succinct annd accurate summary of the role Stevens assigned to poetry as art. The thought reappears in a late poem: The Poem as Icon It is not enough to cover the rock with leaves. We must be cured of it by a cure of the ground Or a cure of ourselves, that is equal to a cure Of the ground, a cure beyond forgetfulness. And yet the leaves, if they broke into bud, If they broke into bloom, if they bore fruit, And if we ate the incipient colorings Of their fresh culls might be a cure of the ground. The fiction of the leaves is the icon Of the poem, the figuration of blessedness, And the icon is the man. (CP, 526) Using contrasting images of disease and fecundity, Stevens insists that man must be cured of poetry (leaves) but paradoxically proposes that poetry is the therapeutic agent (fruit) that immunizes against itself. The argument is familiar. Since man's Ananke (the rock), rather than the poem, is the true "figuration of blessedness," the poem is merely a shadow of its creator. Yet its fictions may bear fruit if the idea of God that it projects is ingested. The disease of art may thus lead to the health of man who, having digested the fruit of his creation, is healed of his affliction - "cured beyond forgetfulness." The poet faces a similar fate. As the officiating midwife assisting at the birth of "the child asleep in its own life," his function is complete once he fulfills his "spiritual" task, or as Stevens once tersely put it, "if the philosopher comes to noth-</page><page sequence="26">784 LEONORA WOODMAN ing because he fails, the poet may come to nothing because he succeeds" (NA,45). "Sombre Figuration," the final canto, proposes to restore the loss of original innocence by ensuring the hegemony of "the man below." Be- ginning with a paean of praise to the Ananke-subman's powers, Stevens next turns to the impending apocalypse his advent heralds. The shape of this future looms in the heavens as a "sprawling portent" revealing "the form / Of a generation that does not know itself" (OP, 68) . Thrice in- sisting on the portent's impalpability, Stevens nevertheless resorts to word picture to paint the intangible subman. What emerges is a gigan- tic "bulk" in Atlas-like support of the horizon, casting its prodigious shadow over the world's inhabitants, breathing upon them an "immense intent" (OP, 68). Predictably, the final twenty-eight lines of the poem foresee a future distinguished by the absence of the secondary imagination, a firm and logical conclusion given the assumptions Stevens brings to the nature of man. Twice insisting that the "imagination has an end" (OP, 71), Ste- vens envisions the "new reality" promised by the reconciliation between man and his Ananke. It is a life of sheer presentness and sensationism. Having shed the temporal understanding by which consciousness medi- ates and orders experience, man is now relieved of history, free to enjoy the "gaudium of being," eternal and timeless: To flourish the great cloak we wear At night, to turn away from the abominable Farewells and, in the darkness, to feel again The reconciliation, the rapture of a time Without imagination, without past And without future, a present time, is that The passion, indifferent to the poet's hum, That we conceal ? (OP, 71) Life is purposeless, desultory. Whatever gesture man is capable of is merely a "gesture's whim" (OP, 71) without forethought or intent. Logically, neither the poet nor the statue intrude to disturb this Utopian paradise, for the poet is banished and the statue, having fulfilled its promise, "is not a thing imagined, a stone / That changed in sleep" (OP, 71). Indeed, man no longer needs such supports, having sup- planted them with himself, gay "Jocundus," acting out his comic inheri- tance in what Stevens was later to call an "unspotted imbecile revery" (CP, 172). The promise fulfilled, Ananke restored to his supreme and</page><page sequence="27">"A Giant on the Horizon": Wallace Stevens 785 undisputed status, man returns to the mindlessness of instinctive life, "Night and the imagination being one" (OP, 71). Stevens's view of the imagination has long been associated in the minds of many critics with "the power of thinking . . . the constructive power of deliberate choice."22 This emphasis on the shaping powers of the conscious mind, regarded as an indwelling creative capacity requiring no transcendental sanction, has fed the commonly held notion that Ste- vens is a humanist. It is true of course that Stevens often insists on the centrality of man, and, indeed, the vision outlined here does not dispute man's significance. At issue is the kind of man Stevens hoped to aggran- dize, a hope that led him to refuse the humanist label. "Humanism is not enough," he wrote in 1945 (L, 489), repeating a distaste expressed five years earlier: "the more I see of humanism, the less I like it" (L, 348) . Stevens clearly sought an alternative. "The chief defect of human- ism," he explained to one correspondent, "is that it concerns human be- ings. Between humanism and something else, it might be possible to create an acceptable fiction" (L, 449) . Embroidering on that "something else," he wrote in his gloss to "Notes toward a Supreme Fiction": The trouble with humanism is that man as God remains man, but there is an extension of man, the leaner being, in fiction, a possibly more than human human, a composite human. The act of recognizing him is the act of this leaner being moving in on us. (L, 434) In this description we recognize the contours of Stevens's "super-ani- mal," similarly described as "inhuman" and "without human weak- ness." If, as I have been suggesting, Stevens's "supreme fiction" is in fact an elaboration of his Ananke-super-animal, it follows that Stevens was right to disclaim humanism, for it is difficult to reconcile the para- dise Ananke represents with anything implied by that term in any of its usual uses. No doubt Stevens regarded his "new reality" as an inevitable and alto- gether superior stage in human evolution. Yet surely there are disquiet- ing features of his vision that cannot be accepted with equanimity. Of special concern is Stevens's distrust of art. It is not merely that Stevens is indifferent to aesthetic considerations but more seriously that he is im- pelled by the logic of his assumptions to dismiss art as a valid expression of human experience. Much like the "ultimate Plato" whose name he invokes, Stevens would banish the poet and his secondary representations from his commonwealth. 22 Martz, p. 203.</page><page sequence="28">786 LEONORA WOODMAN In an unguarded and uncharacteristic confessional moment, Stevens sensed that he might be misunderstood: One man opposing a society If properly misunderstood becomes a myth.
