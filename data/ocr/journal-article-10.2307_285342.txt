<plain_text><page sequence="1">* ABSTRACT In a series of seminal essays, Robert M. Young has insisted on the importance of analyzing the broad historical context in which Darwin's biological views were conceived. In this paper, Young's historiographic approach is assessed theoretically rather than historically: attention is focused on a comparison with recent Darwin studies. After some brief notes on Darwin historiography in general, the principal tenets advocated by Young on a programmatic level are described as 'contextualism' and 'reflexive relativism'. Then the two main sections follow, devoted respectively to examinations of Young's early Darwinian texts, and to his recent writings. Two main historical theses are here discussed separately, and the somewhat irregular nature of Young's Darwinian historiography is defined by means of a limited typology of contextual influence theses. Although Young's programmatic position is accepted as a productive one, the paper concludes by stating that a rather different kind of method, applied in some recent studies, is a more effective approach than his. Robert M. Young and Darwin H istoriog raphy Ingemar Bohlin The origin of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection is one of the most intensely studied topics in the history of science. Since the centenary of the publication of Origin of Species in 1959, the Darwin Industry, as it is frequently referred to, has been established as a major field within the history of science profession. A number of different approaches have been employed in Darwin studies. Many different themes in Darwin's work have been investigated, and vari- ous aspects of the scientific, intellectual, cultural and ideological context in which he worked have been suggested as important in the shaping of his biological theories.' In the debate between advocates of competing historical interpretations and historiographic approaches in Darwin studies, two closely interrelated tensions stand out as fundamental. Social Studies of Science (SAGE, London, Newbury Park and New Delhi), Vol. 21 (1991), 597-648</page><page sequence="2">598 Social Studies of Science First, there is a tension between examinations of archival material and studies of broad contextual issues. Darwin left a vast private material, consisting of theoretical notebooks, unpublished manu- scripts, correspondence, reading notes, marginalia in his private library and the like, a growing portion of which is being published. The attention of historians has been focused, in particular, on a set of notebooks used by Darwin from 1837 to 1839 and published in the 1960s, and from around 1970, a number of meticulous reconstruc- tions of the process in which Darwin formulated his now famous theory on natural selection have been proposed. The understanding that manuscript studies yield of the details of the content of Darwin's theories has proved very difficult, however, to integrate with analyses of the scientific, intellectual and cultural context in which his ideas were formulated. Second, in Darwin studies a strong tension has been felt between internalist and externalist explanations. The modern synthesis in evolutionary biology effected in the 1930s and 1940s assigned Darwin the role of originator of the most fundamental theory in contem- porary biological science. The prestige that this position entails means that there have been good reasons to depict Darwin's achievement as a model of what modern science is widely held to be: objective and free from ideological considerations. On the other hand, there have been equally good reasons to exploit various indi- cations of connections between Darwin's science and social thought, such as the Social Darwinist movement and the possible role of Malthus's doctrine in the origin of the theory of natural selection. From Marx and Engels on, a number of authors have described Darwin's theory as characteristic of, and as issuing from, British nineteenth-century capitalism. In Darwin studies, as in histori- ography of science in general, the last two decades have witnessed a development away from internalism and externalism as clear-cut and mutually exclusive alternatives. In the case of Darwin, a rather strong degree of polarization nevertheless remains with respect to this issue. Robert M. Young's most important texts on Darwin and his place in the nineteenth century were published in the period 1969-73. His contribution has been controversial: assessments of it have ranged from very laudatory estimations to complete dismissals. Trained as an intellectual historian and, from about 1970, an avowed Marxist, Young has been described as 'the historian most concerned to de- pict Darwin's evolutionary theory as embedded in an ideological context'.2 Young's is not obviously the most successful one of the</page><page sequence="3">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 599 numerous attempts made over the last decades at demonstrating links between different aspects of Darwin's work and the context in which it was formulated. Yet more than twenty years after his first main paper on Darwin was published, and a dozen years after the judgement quoted above was made, there is probably unanimity in all quarters as to the correctness of that description. Though he left the history of science profession in the early 1 970s, Young has continued to publish on the role of science in nineteenth- and twentieth-century society. To some extent he returned to Darwin studies during the 1980s. He contributed a paper to the most import- ant of the conferences held in 1982 commemorating the centenary of Darwin's death,3 collected his old essays in a book, making some changes and adding an introduction, and has written a few more articles on the subject since then. Although Young's 1969-73 essays undoubtedly compose the central part of his contribution to Darwin historiography, in some respects the historical interpretation given therein is revised and developed further in his recent publications. The latter are also important in showing what position Young chooses to take to his early work in the light of the considerable development that in the meantime has taken place in the field. In this paper, I define the character of Young's historiography, specifying what can be learnt today from an examination of his contribution to Darwin scholarship. My approach is theoretical, not historical: I make no attempt at providing a contextual account of the development of Young's ideas. In order to reach some conclusions about how an effective strategy of concatenating content and context may be worked out in the case of Darwin and, by analogy, in empirical studies of past science in general - I assess strengths and shortcomings typical of Young's historical approach. Young's General Programinatic Position The fundamental tenet in all of Young's work may conveniently be labelled 'the contextualist thesis': at no point can a demarcation line be drawn between science and its cultural, social, political, economic and ideological contexts. Scientific theories can only be understood in relation to their origin in specific cultural contexts, as well as against the background provided by the ideological uses to which they are put. Young stresses that it is not sufficient merely to add a description of the concrete historical setting in which a scientific theory or</page><page sequence="4">600 Social Studies oJ Science tradition originated and was used, to an analysis in traditional terms of this knowledge. The crux of the matter is that the barrier between cognition and context should be broken down. Scientific knowledge is constructed of, determined by, and therefore should be explained by reference to, elements in the historically specific constellation of social and economic forces in which it was produced, and where it continues to serve a function. Contextualism in this form is tant- amount to relativism, if that term is taken to denote the thesis that all scientific knowledge is dependent on, and relative to, historically con- tingent social systems. In order to emphasize that his version of contextualism is a radical one, Young frequently uses the notion of 'constitutivity'. Only where a strong form of contextualism is adopted are aspects traditionally considered as external to science shown to be constitutive of scientific knowledge. What ultimately distinguishes the weak sense of con- textualism from the strong one, then, is that only the latter pays close attention to the technical content of scientific knowledge. This point is made repeatedly in Young's texts, and is used, for example, in order to criticize that variety of sociology of science employed by the early Robert Merton: 'The internal-external dichotomy can never be transcended, since the substance of science is never considered in detail'.4 It should be observed, however, that Young does not consistently treat science and ideology as inevitably inseparable aspects of human understanding; sometimes he plays upon the traditional positivist distinction between facts and values. The clearest instance of this is a description of the Lysenko affair, in which Young condemns the Stalinists' fusion of natural science with politics, apparently implying that ideological assumptions do not intrude in modern Western science. Lysenkoism, writes Young, is a blatant example of the dominance of political ideology over well-attested scientific findings in the twentieth century, but it was also an international scandal. When it became clear that Watson and Crick were likely to win a Nobel Prize for their pseudo-scientific reactionary findings, modern genetics was finally allowed to begin developing in the Soviet Union.' Reflexive Relativism In all kinds of investigation into science, two different levels are involved: if the enquiries into the natural world conducted by sci-</page><page sequence="5">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 601 entists are considered as located at ground level, studies of science may be seen as being carried out at meta-level. The general descrip- tion of Young's outlook on historiography that I have so far under- taken concerns his position on ground level that is to say, his view of the general nature of science. I now turn to Young's meta-level standpoint that is, to the epistemological status he assigns em- pirical studies of science, including his own historical findings. In texts advocating the strong programme in the sociology of science one finds a tension between ground level and meta-level. Whereas, on the ground level, relativism is expounded, on the meta- level an empiricist and scientific stance is taken. This attitude is perhaps most clearly reflected in the use to which the concept of naturalism is put: the more realistic picture of science allegedly expressed in the strong programme is assumed to emerge once a priori philosophical speculation is substituted by naturalistic studies of the subject matter.6 While empiricism is in itself an untenable thesis, the combination of relativism on one level with empiricism on another is not necessarily self-contradictory. In the case of the strong pro- gramme this issue is closely related to its fourth tenet, according to which the sociology of science should in principle be amenable to its own kind of explanation. The reflexivity thesis has been described as an instance of self-refutation, but such a view cannot be defended, since the theses of impartiality and symmetry clearly state that socio- logical explanations of scientific theories do not imply that those theories must be false.7 Yet the fact that the proponents of the strong programme employ starkly different strategies on the two levels involved in empirical studies of science surely produces a tension in their position. The same tension is found in Harry Collins's radicalization of the strong programme. Collins repudiates the reflexivity thesis, and sug- gests a clear division of labour between practitioners working on the two levels: Just as it is no part of the natural scientist's job to consider the social construction of scientific knowledge, it is no part of the social scientist's job to consider the social construction of social scientific knowledge.8 Although this stand is an attempt to overcome problems raised by the reflexivity thesis, rather than resolving these problems, it makes even stronger the tension caused by bringing together dissimilar elements in the strong programme.9</page><page sequence="6">602 Social Studies of Science Young's position on this matter differs clearly from both of the standpoints just described. In Young's texts there is no tension between ground level and meta-level. Whereas Collins rejects the reflexivity thesis in principle, and the proponents of the strong pro- gramme - in spite of their embracing that thesis take a non- relativistic attitude to social studies of science, Young's fundamental position on the meta-level is consistently relativistic. On grounds of principle, Young is a 'reflexive relativist'. In texts advocating the strong programme, as well as in Young's work, an analogy is drawn from ground level to meta-level in order to define the epistemological status of the standpoint being argued for, but whereas the analogy in the former case proceeds from the scientific element in investigations on ground level, in the latter case its point of departure is their ideological component. The proponents of the strong programme claim to be studying science scientifically, in contradistinction to rationalists and internalists. Young, by contrast, sees his own inter- pretation as equally ideological in nature as those of his opponents. He sometimes applies this general point to his own argumentation in concrete issues, and in his recent articles, he quite explicitly makes the same point with regard to his long-standing quarrel with internalist interpretations of the case of Darwin. Note the perfect symmetry of the following argument, where Young in a manner clearly indicating his reflexive relativism applies a construct which elsewhere is almost always given the shape of an asymmetrical charge. Discussing the possible links between Darwin's work and its context, Young says: Of course, none of the above is a strictly empirical matter, since there are powerful historiographic and ideological reasons for Darwin - or any other scientific thinker - to be articulated with or disarticulated from such blatantly 'non- scientific' affiliations.'" In one important respect, then, one may argue that Young's position is more consistent than that taken in the strong programme and by Collins and, in fact, in most of the social explanations that have been put forward either of contemporary or of historical sci- entific cases." Rather than eliminating the epistemological tension found in most social explanations of science, however, Young simply relocates this tension from one point of intersection to another. While, in approaches where non-relativism on the meta-level is pro- pounded, this thesis accords well with the interpretations of concrete cases which are presented, in Young's work there is in fact a tension between his declared reflexive relativism and his argumentation about</page><page sequence="7">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 603 concrete historical issues. Young's unusual position on the level of programmatic statements has hardly had any effect on the level of his presentation of empirical findings. When arguing for his own view of what the actual facts of the matter are, Young is quite as certain as Bloor, Barnes, Collins or anybody else of presenting the interpretation which tallies best with the evidence. He has even used the term experimentum crucis, borrowed from empiricist philosophy of science, in order to enhance the credibility of his exposition."2 In so far as texts are meant to state something about existing phenomena at all, it is indeed doubtful whether it is either possible or desirable to eliminate this non-relative quality of presentations of empirical findings. The Historical Interpretation in Young's Early Texts Not only on the level of programmatic statements, but also in his interpretations of specific historical episodes, contextualism is the most salient feature of Young's work. The overriding theme in Young's writings on the evolutionary debate of the nineteenth cen- tury is his persistent efforts to show that the biological theories were part of a much broader debate concerning man's place in nature, and that the discussions on scientific, philosophical, theological, social, political and economic questions were conducted within a common context, no part of which should be treated in isolation from others. In Young's attempts to demonstrate this general thesis, two lines of reasoning are predominant. On the one hand, he argues that Darwin received a decisive impetus from Malthus when formulating his theory of natural selection; on the other hand, he claims that Dar- win's theory formed an integral part of the nineteenth-century movement of scientific naturalism. The credibility of Young's general contextualist thesis as applied to the historical case of Darwin de- pends entirely on the success of these two supporting substantial theses. The Malthus Thesis In retrospective remarks, for example, in his Autobiography, Darwin ascribed his reading of Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Pop- ulation in the autumn of 1838 a pivotal role in his path to the theory</page><page sequence="8">604 Social Studies of Science on which his fame rests. According to Darwin himself, it was upon reading Malthus that he grasped the idea that the emergence of new species can be accounted for by natural selection. Malthus's Essay, which first appeared in 1798, in the wake of the French Revolution, was strongly critical of optimistic theories of social progress. At the core of Malthus's argument was his claim that an insurmountable impediment to any radical restructuring of society is provided by a law, according to which the population if unchecked increases at a geometrical rate, while the food supply can only be made to increase arithmetically. This doctrine, used by Malthus for unmistakably ideological purposes, remained central in the social and political debate in Britain at least up to the middle of the nineteenth century. The similarity, and possible historical connection, between the Malthusian law and Darwin's theory, as well as the ideological use to which the latter's work was put by Social Darwinists, has occasioned a number of commentators on the Left to assert that the theory of natural selection really is only a biological application of Malthus's doctrine.3 The reductionism of this attitude to Darwin gave way to an opposite tendency of minimizing Malthus's role when, in the 1950s, following the fundamental biological importance assigned the theory of natural selection by the modern synthesis of the 1930s and 40s, there was a sharp increase in the attention devoted to Darwin by historians. Already in 1909, Francis Darwin, Charles's son, claimed that his father had given Malthus too much credit, and that the reading of Malthus's book really was of minor importance to Dar- win's arriving at his theory. This view received support from several historians in the 1 950s and 1 960s, the most prominent being Sir Gavin de Beer.'4 Somewhat ironically, by publishing some of Darwin's theoretical notebooks, de Beer paved the way for a number of in- terpretations in which Malthus was attributed a much greater role in the origin of Darwin's mature views than de Beer himself was willing to admit him. In 1960, Darwin's transmutation notebooks from the important period 1837-39 were published, and thereby made easily available for analysis. As to the influence of Malthus, a number of pages excised by Darwin from his notebooks, found by de Beer and associates and published in 1967, have proved particularly useful. Soon after their publication, several interpretations differing con- siderably from de Beer's appeared, one of which was written by Young. The core of Young's Malthus thesis was presented as one section of his 1969 article, 'Malthus and the Evolutionists: The Common Con-</page><page sequence="9">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 605 text of Biological and Social Theory',5 one stated aim of which was to counter, equally, the reductionist and the minimizing approaches to the Malthus-Darwin link. By describing how Darwin and four other authors related themselves to the Malthusian doctrine, Young tries to substantiate his basic claim, that in Victorian Britain social and biological thinking were intimately interconnected. In an analysis of the intellectual elements out of which Darwin constructed his theory, Young here singles out Paley and Malthus as the decisive influences. From Paley, Darwin took over the focus on organisms' adaptations to their environment, but whereas Paley applied the argument of design in order to give incontrovertible evidence of the existence of the Creator, Darwin tried to account by natural laws for the adap- tations which Paley pointed out; he '. . . took Paley's answers and converted them into questions'.6 The Malthusian law, on the other hand, Young describes as 'an important step in the series of devel- opments which overcame the belief that man and his environment were in harmony'.'7 Young emphasizes the contrast between the works of Malthus and Paley in this respect: Paley was one of the chief defenders of the belief in harmony, and made vigorous efforts to reconcile the Malthusian law with such a world view. The notion of conflict in nature, which is emphasized in Malthus's argument, is the central feature of the perspective which Darwin took from Malthus. Paley stresses perfect adaptation; Malthus stresses conflict. These were. at one level, antithetical. Darwin synthesizes them. Struggle both e.xplains and produces adaptation." Young then goes on to support his reading of Malthus's influence on Darwin by quoting from various Darwin texts. He cites retro- spective descriptions given by Darwin of how his reading Malthus's Essay helped him to the idea of natural selection. He also cites passages from Darwin's summary of his argument in the first edition of Origin, from his 1842 Sketch and 1844 Essay, and from his D and E notebooks, in which Darwin either describes his theory as derived from Malthus ('This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms'),"9 or discusses its basic principles in a way indicating that they were formulated in close relation to Malthus's argument. After having thus documented that Malthus was important to Darwin, Young specifies more closely the nature of his influence. It was not that Darwin in Malthus's text first encoun- tered the notion that there is a never-ending struggle in nature. On the</page><page sequence="10">606 Social Studies of Science contrary, Young asserts that there are 'innumerable' passages on struggle in Lyell's Principles of Geology, which Darwin had studied closely years before reading Malthus, and which is widely regarded as having exerted a profound and lifelong influence on his thinking. Rather, when Darwin read Malthus, 'he was struck by an inter- pretation of nature which reinforced that gained from Lyell ... and from the study of domesticated animals'.20 Young's conclusion, therefore, is this. It seems that Malthus legitimized the idea of a law of struggle, impressed Darwin with the intensity of struggle, and provided a convenient natural mechanism for the changes which Darwin was studying in the selection of domesticated varieties. It gave Darwin the analogy he needed to move from artificial to natural selection, and this was the essential step in his reasoning: indefinite variation and natural selection could produce new species.2' The ideological meaning of the Malthusian doctrine, however, as well as the historiographic and ideological significance of Young's analysis, is only hinted at in this article. Nor are any conclusions as to a possibly ideological character of Darwin's theory presented. Cert- ainly, Malthus is described as 'the source of the view of nature which led to Social Darwinism - the social struggle for existence, the survival of the fittest',22 and the criticisms levelled at Malthus by some nineteenth-century writers such as Marx and Engels are cited, but Young does not take sides either with or against Malthus's message. While the core of Young's Malthus thesis is given in 'Malthus and the Evolutionists', this and several of its other aspects are elaborated in later texts. In a subsequent paper, Young both dissociates himself from the Malthusian doctrine and explicitly criticizes the tendency to minimize the influence of Malthus on Darwin. Also, the question of to what extent the theory of natural selection itself is ideological in nature is addressed. On the same page on which Young gives one of his statements of his general contextualist thesis as applied to the nine- teenth-century evolutionary debate, affirming that there 'is not at any point any clear line of demarcation between pure science, general- izations based on it, and the related theological, social, political and ideological issues', he treats Darwin as an exceptional case by claim- ing that ideological assumptions can be linked to that theorist's work only to the extent that they are to be found 'in the context, the genesis and the debate into which his ideas fed'.23 In the article that marks the end of Young's early Darwinian</page><page sequence="11">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 607 period, the argument of his Malthus thesis is carried further. It is here maintained that the Malthusian image of nature and society was carried over into the evolutionary debate, and the resulting fusion was the basis for debates on the social meaning of evolutionary theory. The line from Malthus to Darwin and on to so-called 'Social Darwinism' is unbroken and continues to the recent writings on biology and society of, for example, Morris, Ardrey, and Darlington. From start to finish, this has been a reconciling approach. It has served as the basis for the secular theodicy of in- dustrial society and depends on a class doctrine.24 As Young takes a similar position towards the work of Paley, his rendering of the relationship between Malthus and this author now changes from accenting dichotomy to punctuating identity. Rather than stressing the difference between these two thinkers with regard to the conflict-harmony balance, Young brings the similarity of their approaches to the fore, pointing to 'the apologetic and reconciling aspects of writers such as Malthus and Paley'.25 This means that, rather than as residing in the concept of struggle in itself, an under- standing is here outlined in which the ideological import of Malthus's argument is described as being inherent in his conception of an interplay between the notions of conflict and harmony. There is no significant change, however, in the attitude taken to Darwin's work: It should be granted that the work and influence of Lyell and Darwin were less intentionally and obviously an expression of more basic socio-economic forces and structures than, for example, the work and influence of Chambers, Spencer and Wallace.26 What is needed in order to reach interpretations of these theories which neither isolate them from, nor reduce them to, simple re- flections of Victorian society, therefore, is a subtle 'theory of med- iations between socioeconomic base and intellectual superstruc- ture ...'.27 The Naturalism Thesis Malthus also appears as an important representative of the intel- lectual current with which Young's second substantial historical thesis claims Darwin's theory to have been associated, although here Malthus's role is restricted to his pioneering the notion that natural</page><page sequence="12">608 Social Studies of Science laws should be applied to man himself. The kernel of Young's naturalism thesis is given in a 1971 article,28 but, as in the case of the Malthus thesis, some aspects of it are developed more fully in other texts. A convenient point of departure for a summary of the naturalism thesis is two claims made by Young in opposition to much of previous Darwin scholarship. First, Young asserts that Darwin's evolutionary theory formed an integral part of the nineteenth-century movement of scientific naturalism, which united workers from a broad range of disciplines in the commitment to a naturalistic or scientific approach to all aspects of nature and society. This movement was closely related to the philosophical principle of the uniformity of nature, opposing the traditional view, that significant changes in nature were effected by rare, sudden and ill-understood processes. Second, Young wants to disprove an argument employed by many Darwin historians to the effect that Darwin's introduction of the first truly scientific mechanism for evolutionary change sharply marks his theory off from the hypotheses all more or less ideological and anthropomorphic in nature - of the other evolutionists, such as Erasmus Darwin, Lamarck, Chambers, Wallace and Spencer. In order to substantiate these claims, Young focuses upon the manner in which Darwin presented his evolutionary mechanism in a number of successive statements of his theory, and how these were related to the debate that followed upon the publication of the Origin. The material used by Young is Darwin's formulation of his theory in the two drafts from the 1840s, in the paper given jointly with Wallace's in 1858, and, especially, in the various editions of the Origin and other main works, as well as Darwin's correspondence, and the reception of his theory as it is reflected in the main Victorian journals. The principal analogy in Darwin's work, upon which he relied heavily in all expositions of his theory, is that between artificial and natural selection. Now Young claims that in 'moving from artificial to natural, Darwin retains the anthropomorphic conception of selec- tion, with all its voluntarist overtones'.29 This alleged feature of Darwin's theory conforms with Young's view of scientific theories in general, and thus does not point to any unique character pertaining to the theory of natural selection. Young sees the move from artificial to natural selection not only as chosen by Darwin for expository rea- sons, but also as reflecting the actual path by which he reached his theory. The main reason for Darwin's using the analogy, however, was rhetorical:</page><page sequence="13">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 609 In proposing the theory of evolution by means of the mechanism of natural selection he was not really supplying a mechanism at all. Rather, he was providing an abstract account at a general level of how favourable variations might be preserved. . . Darwin's task was to explain away the lack of evidence while repeatedly stressing the greater plausibility of his theory over that of special creation. Whenever he was really in trouble he adopted the same tactic as Lyell, Chambers, and Powell had done - he appealed to the very principle which was at issue, the uniformity of nature.30 Although this had not been Darwin's intention, the anthropomor- phic and voluntarist overtones in Darwin's theory invited readers to interpret his mechanism as an instrument used by the Creator, rather than as a force in nature operating quite independently of divine purposes. As a consequence, Darwin's theory received support from a large group of intellectuals taking an intermediate position between traditional theology and a radical scientific view in which all teleology is banished. That support was an important factor behind Darwin's eventual success in gaining acceptance for an evolutionary view of nature, and the resulting strengthening of the movement of scientific naturalism. In fact, the rhetorical figures chosen by Darwin were so successful in this respect that If Darwin had cynically designed natural selection as a device for speciously aiding the advance of the uniformity of nature, he could not have selected a better contrivance.: Therefore, Young is able to suggest that the traditional account of the relationship between science and religion in the nineteenth century as characterized by a sharp antagonism is unfounded, and that 'the evolutionary debate occurred almost wholly within the context of natural theology rather than as a conflict between science and theology'.3' Another theme in Young's naturalism thesis concerns the severe objections to Darwin's theory raised by contemporary scientists. Young traces Darwin's reactions to such criticisms in successive editions of his books, and suggests that various objections forced Darwin to assign natural selection a diminishing role in the decades after 1859, reducing it to one among several mechanisms of evol- utionary change. To return now to the two claims by Young with which this sum- mary of the naturalism thesis started, it may be concluded that this thesis maintains that precisely because Darwin was so unsuccessful in</page><page sequence="14">610 Social Studies of Science establishing his specific evolutionary mechanism, his introduction of natural selection does not warrant his being clearly separated from other nineteenth-century evolutionists. On the contrary, Young's description of Darwin's achievement in advancing the principle of uniformity of nature and extending the legitimate domain of natural laws serves as the basis for his claim that Darwin's work forms an integral part of the movement of scientific naturalism. As in the Malthus thesis, however, the strong claims of the nat- uralism thesis are tempered by respectful statements as to the scien- tificity of Darwin's work, such as the following. The context within which Spencer - and Wallace - saw the problem of the mechanism of evolution should be contrasted with that of Darwin. Wallace and Spencer can be said to have held and modified their evolutionary views on the basis of philosophical, social, and political theories. There is no obvious basis for attributing Darwin's changing views to such factors, but the point to be noted liere is that they did change considerably.33 That philosophical factors in the latter passage are placed in the same category as social and political ones is indeed bewildering, as the whole argument of the article in which it appears is designed to show that Darwin's philosophical and theological assumptions are re- flected in the heart of his theory.34 On the other hand, the delimitation of Darwin's work from social and political factors implied by this passage corresponds well with how the naturalism thesis is here argued. Young sets out to establish a link between the theory of natural selection and nineteenth-century scientific naturalism, but says nothing of an ideological role possibly played by that movement. True, he does point out that an important ground for the opposition against naturalism was that it threatened the traditional notion of man's place in nature," but he does not proceed to couple the theological and philosophical aspects of this question or of scien- tific naturalism in general to social, political and economic issues. That step, however, is taken in Young's 1973 article, where not only the Malthus thesis, but the naturalism thesis, too, is radicalized. Here the following perspective of the scientific debate of the nineteenth century is presented. The famous controversy in the nineteenth century between science and theology was very heated indeed, and scholars have concentrated on this level of analysis. However, at another level the protagonists in that debate were in fundamental agreement. They were fighting over the best ways of rationalizing the same set of assumptions about the existing order.36</page><page sequence="15">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 611 The social meaning of scientific naturalism in the nineteenth century, then, is claimed to be essentially synonymous with that of the doctrine of Malthus, himself a spokesman for the naturalistic movement. Thus it can be seen that, in a certain respect, Young's 1973 interpretation of the case of Darwin, in which his earlier reading is radicalized, makes its two substantial component theses converge. The Historiographic Pattern in Young's Early Texts Besides the traditional sense in which factors are considered internal or external to science, these concepts are often used to distinguish between two different types of social explanations of science: in the one case, social mechanisms within the scientific community con- stitute the explanatory factor; in the other case, reference is made to social factors in society at large. Normally, external explanations, in this sense of the term, are held to be more difficult to establish than internal ones. While the fact that the social explanations proposed by Young consistently refer to interests in society at large may therefore be taken as a sign of the strength of his achievement, when viewed from another angle, the same fact indicates one of the shortcomings of his historical method. To observe that the links between science and social forces which Young discerns are exclusively external, in the sociological sense of that term, is another way of saying that he fails to relate his subject to the social characteristics of the naturalists' pro- fession in the nineteenth century, and to the institutional framework in which their science was done.37 The fact that Darwin held no professional position in no way makes the question of to what extent and in which ways his work may have been affected by the living conditions specific for scientists in the Victorian age redundant or uninteresting.38 Much more serious than Young's failure to take notice of the institutional setting of nineteenth-century natural history, however, is his neglect of the empirical and theoretical development of this discipline. In consequence of his interest in Darwin and the other evolutionists, Young is of course familiar with a number of aspects of nineteenth-century biological thought, but he makes no attempt at a thorough analysis of the content of the natural-historical theories which Darwin intended his own theory to supersede.39 Nor has Young tried to relate the strategy and style of Darwin's exposition of his theory to the argumentative techniques, and criteria of what</page><page sequence="16">612 Social Studies of Science should be accepted as scientific explanations, that were expounded in influential works in philosophy of science in the mid-nineteenth century.40 For an historian aiming to situate Darwin's work within an ideo- logical context, and to show that normal internal reconstructions are indefensibly narrow, it is quite natural to judge Darwin's contri- bution against the background of texts that served more or less obvious political functions, rather than regard it in the light of the material explored by the internalists. From the widely differing types of material chosen by Young and the traditional internalists he criticizes, the radical differences in their conclusions readily follow. In the one case, Darwin's theory is situated in a context defined by its ideological nature; in the other, it is related to a setting which seems to have been chosen in order to appear completely free from ideological components. Thus, the conflict between Young's interpretation and those with which he polemicizes concerns different assumptions about science and how it is related to society, rather than different conceptions as to how the historical material, once chosen, should be treated. It also should be noted that Young's approach is limited to the ideas of the intelligentsia. This means both that popular opinion and culture is neglected,4" and that only the sphere of ideas is investigated. Although he sporadically refers to material circumstances, Young, his Marxist conviction notwithstanding, essentially examines learned ideas in isolation from concrete material events. One further, related weakness in Young's social explanations should be mentioned. The social analysis of Victorian Britain forming the basis for his assigning various religious, philosophical and scientific ideas ideological func- tions is pointed but rudimentary. Young certainly observes dissimil- arities and conflicts among the ideas of different representatives of the intelligentsia, but when defining their ideological value, he restricts himself to noting their importance in legitimating or, in a few rare instances, questioning the oppression of the working class. This interpretation, in which the bulk of the intelligentsia is treated as one homogeneous group, forming an integral part of the ruling class, operates with only one dimension of social, political and economic conflict. If different scientific and philosophical ideas had been linked to different fractions within the intelligentsia, each with its distinctive social interests, and each perhaps allied to specific groups in society at large, a much stronger case could have been made for a social understanding of the evolutionary debate of the nineteenth century.42</page><page sequence="17">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 613 I now turn to the crucial question of the extent to which Young succeeds in lending credibility to his proposed link between Darwin's work and the context to which he has chosen to relate it. In answering this question, I deal separately with each of Young's concrete his- torical theses. As for the Malthus thesis, it is important that at least four types of source are set apart. This thesis is essentially a claim about an influence in the history of ideas supported by documents on three other levels: first, Darwin's characterization of his theory upon publishing it, as well as his retrospective accounts of how he reached it; second, his early drafts of the theory; and third, his theoretical notebooks. Young points to similarities, on the level of published theories in the history of ideas, between the theory of natural selection and certain elements in the arguments of Malthus and Paley, two of the best-known and most influential thinkers in the intellectual mid- dle-class culture of Britain in the 1 830s, and makes the further claim that the notions of struggle and perfect adaptation provided the key ingredients out of which Darwin's theory was formed. Although it is elegantly conceived, in order to gain acceptance, this influence thesis must be supported by evidence on other levels than that of the treatises published by the writers concerned. In the case of Malthus's influence, Young claims to be able to present such evidence. Accordingly, Young quotes a characterization of Darwin's evol- utionary theory given in an introductory summary of the argument in the first edition of the Origin, as well as retrospective accounts given by Darwin of how he grasped the idea of natural selection. Though Darwin, in all these passages, emphasizes either the dependence of his theory on the Malthusian doctrine or Malthus's role in its genesis, they were all written more than twenty years after that influence is supposed to have taken place. In some respects, of course, a scientist has privileged access to the path to his or her own ideas, but it is important to note that there are several reasons why the genesis of a theory as reported by its author may differ from the actual process, and retrospective descriptions given long after the event certainly cannot be taken at face value.43 But Young largely fails to appreciate the forces at work in the transition of an idea from private speculation to discussions and correspondence among colleagues and on to the public sphere of books and journals, as well as the corresponding tensions between the different levels of relative privacy in the history of science.' Throughout his work on the evolutionary debate, Young cites retrospective accounts and private correspondence without res- ervations, and, more generally, fails to explore the considerable</page><page sequence="18">614 Social Studies of Science possibilities for a social understanding of science residing in the processes by which an argument is transformed from private and semi-private levels to the fully public sphere. The examples which Young cites of Darwin retrospectively attrib- uting to Malthus a key role in the genesis of his theory, therefore, are of limited value in demonstrating his claimed historical influence. But Young also supports his case by quoting from material on the levels of theoretical notebooks and early drafts; directly or indirectly, these quotations all point to the importance of Malthus in Darwin's rea- soning at these comparatively early stages in his theorizing. Young fails, however, to provide a proper analysis of Darwin's theory and its development in time. Darwin's notes - even those sentences which he may have jotted down during the most intense moments of the process of his gradually working out the idea of natural selection do not in themselves show how that idea was conceived. Only when the archival material is investigated in the light of a careful recon- struction of the process in which the theory was formulated is it possible to arrive at a precise interpretation of the various ideas found in it. Moreover, only by means of a thorough analysis of Darwin's theory and a reconstruction of how its constituent elements changed concurrently with his continuous reading, thinking and observing, is it possible to determine the significance and nature of the influence of other thinkers' ideas on his work. Taken together, the material which Young presents rather strongly supports the claim that there is an historical link connecting the theory of natural selection with Mal- thus's doctrine and that Malthus in some way was very important to Darwin. Yet in the absence of a substantial analysis of the process in which Darwin formulated his theory, the material does not reveal the precise nature of the Malthusian influence. This means that, essen- tially, Young fails to reconcile his interpretation on the level of published theories of the relationship between Darwin and Malthus with what emerges from the material he presents at three other levels of relative privacy; consequently, his analysis of this material does not bear out his hypothesis about the specific nature of Malthus's in- fluence. In particular, Young neither shows that the ideological ele- ments in Malthus's thinking were significant to Darwin, nor describes how they were carried over into his evolutionary theory, provided that this did happen at all. Thus, in the Malthus thesis, Young really does not succeed in demonstrating that the content of Darwin's biological theory was determined by the impact of Malthus's social doctrine, except in the strictly limited sense that some idea in</page><page sequence="19">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 615 Malthus's Essay proved to be important in its genesis. Without attempting to offer any full typology, three different types of explanation may be distinguished within the category of external influence theses in the history of science. In the first and weakest type of influence account, it is shown that a scientist made use of some idea found in an ideological text when formulating a scientific theory, but the idea is not described as having carried social or political impli- cations. In the second type of explanation, by contrast, it is proved that an idea which was incorporated into a scientific theory embodied ideologically laden assumptions that made the theory an expression of a specific political outlook. Such an influence may take place whether or not the author sympathizes with the ideology in question. In the third and strongest type of external influence thesis, finally, it is demonstrated that a specific application of an idea was conditioned by its ideological usefulness -that is to say, that the author of a scientific theory chose to employ a certain concept because of its social or political implications. Young's Malthus thesis establishes the first and weakest form of ideological influence beyond reasonable doubt. Quite as obviously, Young makes no attempt at providing evidence of the third form of external influence.45 In order to prove the strongest of the types of historical influence here outlined, it is, of course, necessary to point out the ideological affiliation of the scientist concerned, but Darwin's social or political attitudes are not described in the Malthus thesis. In fact, nowhere in Young's early work on the evolutionary debate is an instance indicating a political or ideological commitment on Dar- win's part cited, either from his correspondence and private papers or from his published work. As for the second form of external influence, on the other hand, to some but only to some -extent may this be said to be established in the Malthus thesis. While nothing is said of Darwin's intentions, Young claims that the use to which the notion of struggle is put in the respective arguments indicates an ideologi- cal congeniality between the theories of Darwin and Malthus. But Young's analysis on the level of published theories brings out the ideological nature of Darwin's work in very general terms only, and the reconstruction of the process in which the theory of natural selection was worked out is too faintly suggested to sustain his specific intellectual-historical thesis. In the naturalism thesis, by contrast, Young traces the devel- opment of a narrow but essential aspect of Darwin's theory. On the one hand, he brings into relief the manner in which Darwin presented</page><page sequence="20">616 Social Studies of Science his mechanism of evolutionary change, to some extent in early ex- positions, but chiefly from 1859 on in successive editions of Darwin's main works; on the other hand, he relates these presentations to theological, philosophical and scientific problems, as reflected in Darwin's correspondence with his colleagues and in the general Victorian journals. Young highlights the vicissitudes of Darwin's rhetorical figures in the period after his theory of transmutation was made public, as well as the varying degrees of prominence which he at different times in this period ascribed to the mechanism of natural selection, and juxtaposes these changes with the reactions that the Origin evoked, and with the debate about how best to strike a balance between the notion of an almighty Creator and the operation of natural laws. In effect, in the naturalism thesis Young reconstructs the development of one crucial element in Darwin's theory, in the last few decades of his life, fully enough to be able to explain important features of the changing formulation of the theory by reference to aspects of the intellectual context in which it was received, thereby establishing a link between Darwin's work and important philo- sophical and theological issues in Britain in the middle part of the nineteenth century. More specifically, Young's analysis bears out his thesis that Darwin's biological theory was conceived - as well as received - as an integral part of nineteenth-century scientific nat- uralism. Later on, Young added the claim that the movement of scientific naturalism served an important ideological function. He fails, however, to demonstrate that the varying expositions of Dar- win's theory can be directly related to ideological considerations, but connects theory and ideology only secondarily, by giving an in- terpretation of the social significance of the intellectual movement with which the theory was associated. Hence the strong claim that Darwin's work was directly coupled to its ideological context is not substantiated by Young's analysis in the naturalism thesis. The argumentation in the naturalism thesis may be somewhat more closely defined when judged against the rationale, offered above, of different forms of influence explanations. As the naturalism thesis involves no claim about an historical influence, the first type of ideo- logical influence account is of course irrelevant here, but the second and third types may easily be generalized so as to cover all kinds of social explanations in the history of science. Accordingly, one may discriminate analyses which establish the existence of political or economic underpinnings of scientific theories, irrespective of the intentions and political preferences of their originators, from those</page><page sequence="21">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 617 which in addition show that such features stem from deliberate efforts on the part of the authors. In the naturalism thesis, both these forms of explanation are presented and sustained, although not with respect to ideological issues as such, but only as far as philosophical and theological questions are concerned. If compared on this basis, then, Young's naturalism thesis would turn out to be stronger, in general terms, than his Malthus thesis. As was evident from the passages quoted in my summaries of Young's concrete historical theses, he vacillates between two widely divergent positions towards the question of to what extent he is in fact able to demonstrate a link between the content of Darwin's work and the social, political and economic context in which it originated. On the one hand, he characterizes his investigations into the nineteenth- century evolutionary debate in a manner consistent with his pro- grammatic position, claiming, for instance, that So-called 'non-scientific' factors have often been seen as contextual; we are begin- ning to see that they are constitutive; and in the present case there is considerable evidence that they were determinant of the biological theories themselves.46 In line with such statements, Young at one place describes Darwinism as . . . an extension of laissez-faire economic theory from social science to biology',47 thereby in effect providing just the kind of reductionist interpretation of Darwin's evolutionary theory that he elsewhere dissociates himself from. On the other hand, in glaring contrast to strong claims of this kind, one finds in Young's texts expressions of an exceedingly cautious attitude towards the crucial issue of to what extent he has succeeded in integrating cognition and context in the case of Darwin: Although a great deal of controversy about the meaning of Darwin's theory for man and society was conducted in his name, Darwin resolutely declined to take part in it. One's analysis of the role of ideology in his work lies, therefore, in the context, the genesis and the debate into which his ideas fed.48 Here Young in fact describes Darwin's biological work as completely free from ideological or external elements, and goes on to spell out the logical implication of such a view, which is that the social historian of science can do no more than point out ideological components in the influences on Darwin's theory, in its cultural and intellectual setting, and in the uses to which it was put by others. However, Young has also made statements implying an intermediate position towards the</page><page sequence="22">618 Social Studies of Science same question. In the article marking the end of Young's early period, he gives the following summary of how far he has been able to go in the direction of a social explanation of the theory of natural selection, as well as of what others have accomplished in the case of Lyell. Though not at all as modest as in the passage just quoted, Young is here far more guarded than in his most confident moments. Having got part of the way by showing the centrality of theological and phil- osophical questions in the origins, substance and vicissitudes of their theories, one is left with the need for a subtle and complex theory of mediations if it is to be possible to make a strong case for them as figures who should be viewed in the simultaneous perspectives of science and socio-political ideas.49 The two substantial historical theses upon which Young's con- textualist interpretation of Darwinism in his early period rests differ considerably from each other as to the historiographic approach adopted; one reason for this is surely that Young's contribution was given in the form of a number of separate papers constituting case studies of different aspects of the Victorian debate on evolution rather than in the monograph format. In consequence of its complex and irregular nature, the historiographic pattern exhibited in the texts of Young's early period cannot be subsumed under any simple concept. Yet it is probably fair to say that, on the whole, this pattern is closer to contextualism in that sense which is repudiated by Young in his programmatic arguments, than to the kind of contextualist ap- proach which he endorses. It is important to point out the degree of discrepancy that exists between Young's general programmatic po- sition and his achievement as a Darwin historian, as well as to demonstrate the inadequacy of a number of mutually opposing statements of historiographic self-understanding. Still, there remains the fact that Young in his early period made an invaluable con- tribution to Darwin studies: first, by exploring important aspects of the nineteenth-century context which until then had only been des- cribed summarily, in so far as they had been noticed at all; and second, by demonstrating an historical link between some of these contextual aspects and Darwin's celebrated biological theory. The Historical Interpretation in Young's Recent Texts An important new feature to appear in Young's return to the field of Darwin studies in the 1980s, is that Darwin's work is now unequi-</page><page sequence="23">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 619 vocally characterized as being of an ideological nature. In an essay significantly entitled 'Darwinism Is Social',50 Young quotes a series of statements from Darwin's Descent of Man which show that here, in one of his most famous biological works, Darwin explicitly discusses the social and political implications of his theory of natural selection in a manner characteristic of what is usually referred to as Social Darwinism.5' On the basis of such evidence, Young now states that 'we do find social concepts at every level inside the Darwinian theory. In that sense Darwinism is social'.52 In contrast to the texts of his early period, in Young's recent discussions there are no attempts at distancing either Darwin's work or his intentions from the ideological debate.53 Instead of being self-critical of his earlier equivocations on this matter, however, Young remarks that the fact that 'Darwin was a Social Darwinist is not news, however often it is conveniently for- gotten'.54 Young is right that Darwin's explicitly ideological state- ments have largely been ignored by Darwin scholars, although after the publication in the late 1970s of an important essay by John Greene,55 the great naturalist's political beliefs are often noted. When first presenting his evidence of avowedly political attitudes in Dar- win's writings, Young refers to Greeine's essay as supporting his case.56 No doubt, the discussion of Darwin's ideological standpoint offered in Young's recent texts confirms and strengthens the con- clusions reached by Greene, whose study may well have helped Young change his position on this issue. Another new strand in Young's recent texts on Darwin is his introduction of the psychological dimension. In one of these papers, Young outlines an historical model which seeks to combine a human- istic Marxist approach with a psychoanalytic view of human motivation.57 Though composing an entirely novel theme in Young's Darwinian writings, the prominence given here to individual and psychological aspects may nevertheless be seen simply as a variation of his basic contextualist outlook. Such a turn is in fact evident in Young's latter-day thinking; in several recent papers, he argues for the need for a 'psychosexual genetic epistemology'.58 He even poses the question, Once we move off a positivist philosophy of science and accept that knowledge never severs its links with its genesis or its context - that, on the contrary, it is constituted by them - then how can primitive psychogenesis be left out?59 However, the emergence of a psychological strand in Young's texts does not correspond to any change in his historical interpretation of</page><page sequence="24">620 Social Studies of Science the case of Darwin. Far from offering any insights into Darwin's personality, Young points out how difficult a subject matter this is.60 Obviously, then, the psychological theme remains on the program- matic level and has not been integrated into Young's historical examination of Darwinian topics. This, of course, does not mean that such a line of enquiry is unpromising; I, for one, find Young's biographical-historical model quite sympathetic. It should be noted, however, that if this model were accepted and made use of within Darwin studies, contextual interpretations of the theory of natural selection would take a completely new turn, as psychological ex- planations in this field are rarely given a prominent place.6' While there is no doubt that Young's introduction of a psycho- logical theme does not concur with a shift in his historical treat- ment of Darwin, appraising the possible effects of the sharpening of Young's position that issues from his new attitude to Darwin's polit- ical conduct is a more difficult task. In order to identify changes that Young's historical argumentation may have undergone - whether or not they are related to this radicalization of his contextualist con- strual of the theory of natural selection - I devote the remainder of this section to an examination of the substantial theses as represented in his late articles. The naturalism thesis can here be dealt with quickly. In Young's new texts nothing is added to his earlier pre- sentation of this thesis. On the other hand, the claim that scientific naturalism was of great importance in nineteenth-century Britain, and that Darwin's work was connected to that movement, has re- ceived support from several other historians,62 and, to the best of my knowledge, none has seriously questioned it. There is no need, there- fore, to revise the conclusions about Young's naturalism thesis given in the previous section of this paper. An evaluation of Young's Malthus thesis, by contrast, requires some analytical effort. First of all it will be necessary to sumrnarize some important contributions to Darwin studies made after Young first entered the field. Interlude: New Research Relevant to the Malthus Link Sandra Herbert and Peter Vorzimmer were among the historians who, soon after the pages excised by Darwin from his transmutation notebooks were retrieved and published, offered, on the basis of this new evidence, reconstructions of how the theory of natural selection was formulated.63 Without making use of the material published in</page><page sequence="25">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 621 1967, Michael Ghiselin reached similar conclusions.64 Apart from the fact that they all either ignored or rejected any possible ideological implications for Darwin's biological work, Herbert's, Vorzimmer's and Ghiselin's constructions shared two crucial characteristics. Like the more or less contemporaneous interpretation set forth by Young in 'Malthus and the Evolutionists', Herbert's, Vorzimmer's, and Ghiselin's accounts take exception to the tendency towards min- imizing Malthus's impact on Darwin. In contradistinction to Young, however, the other three scholars were alike in emphasizing the distinction between inter- and intraspecific struggle. The former concept refers to competition between different species, whereas the latter term bears upon the competition going on between individuals of one and the same species. As I have already pointed out, one premise of Young's explanation of Malthus's influence on Darwin is the assertion that he was familiar with the notion of struggle in nature before his Malthusian insight; when reading Malthus's Essay in 1838, Darwin 'was struck by an interpretation of nature which reinforced that gained from Lyell'." This conclusion follows from Young's contention that there are 'innumerable passages on struggle'66 in Lyell's Principles of Geology, which he supports by quoting the following sentence from that work: In the universai struggle for existence, the right of the strongest eventually prevails; and the strength and durability of a race depends mainly orn its prolificness, in which hybrids are acknowledged to be deficient.67 Now, in Vorzimmer's and Herbert's reconstructions, it is claimed that Lyell's depiction of a struggle for existence highlights only the interspecific aspect of that notion. In order to bear out this claim, Herbert in fact cites the very same sentence from Lyell's main work which Young chose as evidence of his reading, pointing out that it explicitly refers to competition between races that is, to inter- specific struggle.68 Herbert, Vorzimmer and Ghiselin all claim that the step from the level of species to the level of individuals was the decisive one in Darwin's search for an evolutionary mechanism. Although Malthus's discussion was restricted to the human species, the fact that his doctrine was based on the notion of individual struggle meant that it provided Darwin with an element which was to prove absolutely crucial to his theorizing. This account of how Darwin worked out his theory was supported by the elaborate recon- struction presented by David Kohn in 1980.69</page><page sequence="26">622 Social Studies of Science In an article appearing in 1976, the distinction between two dif- ferent concepts of struggle was used by Peter Bowler in order to attack Young's assertion that there was an important ideological element in the historical link between Malthus and Darwin.70 Bowler too, suggests that Malthus's Essay furnished Darwin with what he needed to be able to formulate the theory of natural selection. Furthermore, like Herbert and Vorzimmer, Bowler finds that Lyell's image of a struggle in nature concerns interspecific competition, while the notion of individual struggle was the crucial component in Dar- win's Malthusian insight. Bowler argues, however, for the necessity of distinguishing between two main types of social theory in the nineteenth century. The laissez-faire philosophy of which Adam Smith and Malthus were chief representatives was characterized by a conception of the social and economic order quite different from the concept of 'survival of the fittest' extolled some decades later in the teachings of the Social Darwinists. Although both schools recom- mended economic competition between individuals, they are sep- arated by a 'real conceptual gulf'.7' This is how Bowler describes laissez-faire economics: Far from seeing society as a struggle for existence in which the weak suffer and the strong triumph, this view held that things were so designed that competition operated for the benefit of all. The emphasis was not on those who win or lose in the competition, but on the advantages for the whole society produced by the har- monious tension between conflicting interests. The luxury of the rich is not the prize of strength gained at the expense of the poor and weak, but a stimulus necessary to ensure that those born to wealth use it to the best advantage (i.e. for the public as well as their own private benefit).]2 Accordingly, Bowler maintains that the notion of intraspecific struggle is not to be found in the analysis of contemporaneous British society given by Malthus in his Essay. The concept was used by Malthus only when discussing competition among primitive peoples, a matter of rather peripheral concern to his argument, and this is where Bowler suggests that Darwin found this crucial idea.73 This would mean that, although a notion of struggle figures prominently in both men's work, two different concepts of struggle,74 and two distinct ideologies, are involved. As Young's claim concerning an ideological link from Malthus's work to Darwin's, like the corresponding assertion about an unbroken ideological line from Malthus to Social Darwinism, presupposes one single and unified concept of struggle, Bowler repu- diates that reading of the evidence. Still, after having thus disproved a</page><page sequence="27">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 623 major attempt to relate Darwin's theory to ideological features of its intellectual context, he leaves open the possibility of another kind of ideological connection. If, writes Bowler, we accept that life or death competition was in fact the spirit of early capitalism, then Darwin's theory could be seen as a reflection of society as it really was, not as it was represented in the academic debates of the political economists.75 In retrospective remarks - for instance, in his Autobiography and in an oft-cited letter to Wallace - Darwin claims that, through his studies of how domesticated productions were attained, he under- stood that selection was the means by which changes in species were brought about, so that before he turned to Malthus he was already seeking a natural analogue of this mechanism. If this version is correct, then the order of presentation chosen by Darwin in all expositions of his theory, with a discussion of artificial selection consistently preceding the introduction of the mechanism of natural selection, reflects the actual path by which he reached his theory. Darwin's retrospective account of how his central analogy was formed has been accepted by most historians, including, for example, de Beer, Vorzimmer, Bowler, Ghiselin, Michael Ruse and Silvan Schweber.76 As was evident from the summary of his early Darwinian texts given in the previous section, Young takes the same view; in fact, it underpins the argumentation of both his concrete historical theses. Young's construction of Malthus's influence on Darwin proceeds from the assumption that when the young naturalist read the Essay, he was already familiar with the selection of domesticated varieties, as well as with the notion of struggle in nature. Likewise, the claim that anthropomorphic overtones were retained in Darwin's moving from artificial to natural selection - indeed, the presumption that there was such a move - is an important premise of Young's naturalism thesis. From 1970 on, however, several leading Darwin scholars have suggested another, quite different interpretation of the origin of the analogy from the artificial to the natural. According to the revisionist position on the analogy issue, which has been advocated by Herbert, Kohn, Dov Ospovat and Camille Limoges,77 the notebook evidence - as opposed to Darwin's retrospective commentaries shows that until he was able to formulate the idea of natural selection, Darwin's biological theorizing was clearly non-selectionist. This would mean that, rather than being led by it to the notion of natural selection,</page><page sequence="28">624 Social Studies of Science Darwin comprehended the principle of artificial selection -and formulated his central analogy - only after he had worked out his evolutionary mechanism. Such a position harmonizes well with the distinction between inter- and intraspecific struggle discussed above. Following the publication of Darwin's transmutation notebooks, Darwin historians have to a great extent concentrated on the early period from 1837 to 1839 which this material covers, paying attention also to the 1842 Sketch and the 1844 Essay. In many historical studies of the genesis and development of the theory of natural selection, it is treated as more or less completed by the end of 1838 - that is, soon after Darwin had his Malthusian insight. Young's reading of the evidence makes no exception to this tendency. In Young's recon- struction, the fundamental principles of Darwin's mature theory are described as being laid down with his integrating Malthus's doctrine into his biological thinking. Dov Ospovat is the historian who has most cogently argued that Darwin's theory underwent significant changes between 1844 and 1859. By the same token, he has made a strong case for the claim that natural theological assumptions continued to determine the structure of Darwin's biological theorizing well beyond his conceiving the mechanism of natural selection. Consequently, the reconstruction of the development of Darwin's theory given by Ospovat brings out an essential continuity through the Malthusian impact. Ospovat is unequivocal about the ideological function intended and served by Malthus's Essay. On this interpretation, however, the Malthusian principle of population, with its strong emphasis on conflict, was accommodated within an harmonious conception of society. Ospovat even argues that the ideological purpose of Mal- thus's argument required such a move: In order to persuade the lower and reassure the higher classes that despite in- evitable poverty and want the existing order is the best possible, it was necessary to explain how the inconveniences occasioned by the principle of population were conducive to universal good.78 Similar harmonious assumptions about the world of plants and animals were of course characteristic of British natural history in the early nineteenth century, with its strong religious affiliation, and this view of nature constituted the point of departure for Darwin's spec- ulations on transmutation. Now, Ospovat claims that historians have mistakenly read Darwin's mature position into his 1838 notes, and that, as a consequence, the extent to which Darwin relinquished his</page><page sequence="29">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 625 traditional assumptions about nature upon reading Malthus's Essay has been greatly overrated. Darwin, says Ospovat, initially envisaged natural selection as operating in precisely the same natural theological context in which Malthus had set his principle of population the context of a system of beneficent laws.79 In this view, Darwin's harmonious conception of nature was quite typical of the natural history of his age, and the affinity between Darwin and Malthus in this respect was anything but random. Ospovat discriminates between two varieties of perfect adaptation in nineteenth-century biological thinking.80 Special teleology was the traditional position, according to which every species was designed to fit its place in nature in a separate act of creation. In the 1 830s, general teleology became common among prominent naturalists. This view held that organisms were generated by natural laws, and thus were adapted to their environment only within the limits set by these laws. Yet, as the natural laws were still seen as being designed to produce organisms that fit their office in nature, this was only a variation on the theme of perfect adaptation. In his reconstruction of the development of Darwin's theory, Ospovat argues convincingly that although Dar- win at an early stage abandoned his belief in special teleology, the general teleological variety of perfect adaptation continued to de- termine the structure of his theory well beyond the 1844 draft. Furthermore, Ospovat has presented a social interpretation of the prevalence of the notion of perfect adaptation in the first half of the nineteenth century, suggesting that it served an important ideological function. This analysis, it may be noted, constitutes a good example of what I referred to above as the second form of contextual influence explanation in the history of science. Although the general teleo- logical brand of perfect adaptation left much greater scope for bio- logical laws than did its traditional counterpart even allowing a transmutationist position with respect to species Ospovat's con- textual explanation applies to both versions of that concept: After 1789 in Great Britain, natural theology and the view of nature it presupposed and taught acquired an increased ideological importance which it kept throughout the tumultuous years between Waterloo and the Great Exhibition of 1851. This reinforced the idea that nature is a harmonious and orderly system, operating in accordance with purposeful laws established by God. It would probably be fair to say that the strength of this tradition, especially in Britain but also on the continent, meant that for most naturalists educated in the early nineteenth century, whatever</page><page sequence="30">626 Social Studies of Science their political or religious interests, perfect adaptation had the status not of a postulate of natural theology, but of a fact apparent to all who took the trouble to observe organisms." On Ospovat's reading of the evidence, the natural theological structure was not eliminated from the theory of natural selection until the mid-1950s, that is to say, a few years before the Origin was published. This reconstruction of the development of Darwin's theory differs considerably from what has become a prevalent view in the field. While Ospovat agrees with the majority of his colleagues that it was upon reading Malthus's Essay that Darwin was able to formulate the idea of natural selection, he differs from most other Darwin scholars in claiming that what is today seen as the theory's distinctly Darwinian character did not emerge until shortly before its eventual publication. In practice, if not stated in so many words, this means that, in accounting for Darwin's mature views, Ospovat as- cribes to theoretical developments in the middle part of the 1 850s a significance greater than Darwin's working out the idea of natural selection almost twenty years earlier. In a joint paper, Jonathan Hodge and David Kohn have offered the most detailed reconstruction to date of how Darwin's species work was affected by his reading of Malthus." In significant respects, this interpretation deviates from the one previously presented by Kohn. As in Kohn's earlier account and several others Malthus is seen as giving Darwin the impetus to take the step from interspecific to intraspecific struggle. The importance of that step is here played down considerably, however, as the all-important ideas of chance variation and of an essential similarity between artificial and natural selection are described, not as having grown out of what Darwin gleaned from Malthus, but as emerging several months later from quite different reflections. In Hodge's and Kohn's close reading of the notebook evidence, then, Darwin's first grasp of leading principles of his mature theory are separated from his Malthusian insight. In this regard, this interpretation is concordant with that suggested by Ospovat. One further point at which the reconstruction offered in Hodge's and Kohn's joint essay departs from Kohn's earlier con- ception should be noted. Concerning the origin of the selection analogy, a modified version of the traditional position is taken: the analogy was formulated considerably later than what is usually assumed, but when Darwin did arrive at it, it was a decisive step on his path to the theory of natural selection.</page><page sequence="31">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 627 The Malthus Thesis With the exception of the paper by Hodge and Kohn, all the con- tributions to Darwin history which have here been summarized are alluded to in the discussions about the Malthus connection offered in Young's recent Darwinian texts.83 Considering the analogy question first, the important point to note is that, if accepted, the revisionist position on this issue would strengthen the Malthus link. If it was upon reading Malthus that Darwin saw the possibility of applying the principle of selection to changes occurring both under domestication and in a state of nature, then this dimension must be added to that thinker's influence on Darwin. Young does not take this opportunity to strengthen his Malthus thesis, however; quite the reverse, in fact. As will be seen below, far from modifying his earlier interpretation in the direction of the revisionist position, Young in recent texts em- phatically rejects that view. The distinction between inter- and intraspecific struggle introduced by Herbert and Vorzimmer, too, implies a connection from Malthus's work to Darwin's stronger than that suggested by Young's recon- struction. The weight that should be attached to Malthus in this regard is dependent on the extent to which the perspective adopted in his work is seen as diverging from that of other late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century thinkers. If the concept of struggle applied by Malthus in one respect differs from that with which Darwin, through his reading of Lyell, was already familiar, and if that dif- ference proved to be crucial to Darwin's reaching his theory, then the role played by Malthus in this process was more profound than if he just 'reinforced' what Darwin had already 'gained from Lyell'.84 When such an approach to the distinction between different concepts of struggle is combined with the revisionist position on the analogy issue, as in Herbert's interpretation and Kohn's 1980 exposition, the Malthus link stands out as particularly strong.85 To a certain extent, of course, the kind of historical reconstruction that follows from the distinction between inter- and intraspecific struggle as applied by Herbert, Vorzimmer and Kohn opposes Young's interpretation, in which struggle is treated as a unified concept. Still, given the patent similarities existing between them, an attempt to integrate this dis- tinction into Young's reading of the Malthus influence could well turn out to be successful. If possible, such an integration might con- siderably strengthen Young's case. Curiously enough, however, Young neither attempts to accommodate</page><page sequence="32">628 Social Studies of Science that distinction within his own interpretation, nor does he dissociate himself from it. Young mentions Vorzimmer's, Herbert's and Kohn's articles as they appear, but nowhere does he comment upon the distinction they make between inter- and intraspecific struggle. Instead, he consistently refers to reconstructions relying on that distinction in a manner suggesting that they support his own interpretation, thereby implying the differences between the two types of construal to be insignificant. While in the hands of Herbert, Vorzimmer and the early Kohn the distinction between inter- and intraspecific struggle confirms and strengthens Young's general claim, that the impact of Malthus was crucial in the genesis of Darwin's theory, Young's neglect of their distinction certainly does not enhance the credibility of his explication of the specific nature of that influence. As for Bowler's criticism of Young's Malthus thesis, the radicalized reading of Malthus given in the essay ending Young's early Darwinian period provides him with a foundation for an effective retort. If Young succeeded in modifying his Malthus thesis so as to make it fully congruent with the construction outlined in his 1973 discussion, he might claim the ideological potency of Malthus's Essay to be immanent in the tension between harmony and conflict, and between that text and the social reality which it represented, instead of as Bowler's interpretation implies being situated within the text as such. Young does give Bowler an answer, but one that is formulated in an entirely different manner. Attempting to circumvent some of Bowler's objections to Young's exposition, D. L. LeMahieu once remarked, 'What Malthus said and what others thought he said were frequently at odds . . .'." Echoing this statement, Young in a footnote added to the reissue of his 1969 article writes: A certain amount of printer's ink has been spilled on the question of whether or not the following exposition correctly conveys 'what Malthus said'. I find this odd, since one of the principal points of this essay (along with others of mine) is that 'what someone said' has everything to do with what they were taken to have said. There are five readings of Malthus in this essay. There is no neutral text for us, any more than there is a neutral observation language in science or an unmediated nature for people. This is my reply to Bowler (1976) ...87 The claim that texts cannot be given impartial interpretations is sound enough; it is also, of course, consistent with Young's long- standing adherence to contextualism and relativism. But even though the five writers whose reactions to Malthus Young discusses in his</page><page sequence="33">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 629 1969 text refer to different segments of Malthus's argument, Young does not point out any disparity between these authors concerning their understanding of Malthus's text. Far from showing how dif- ferently the meaning of Malthus's argument has been construed, Young describes a fragment of what - given his own preferences - appears to have been Malthus's actual role in history. In this sense, then, the focus of Young's 1969 explication of the influence of Mal- thus is decidedly on its objective rather than its subjective aspect. Young's claim, that there is an unbroken ideological line extending from Malthus through Darwin and the Social Darwinists to twen- tieth-century writings, constitutes another salient example of this attitude in his work. Indeed, in Young's historical analysis of Dar- winian subjects as a whole, the emphasis is laid firmly upon objective similarities and connections between ideas. Hence Young's insistence on the infeasibility of neutral interpretations is ineffective as a defence against Bowler's strictures. Like the interpretation presented by Herbert and Vorzimmer, it might well prove possible to integrate Ospovat's reconstruction of the development of Darwin's theory with Young's analysis. In the case of Ospovat, however, such an undertaking would doubtlessly require a much greater effort. One instance in which the divergence between Young's and Ospovat's reconstructions may easily be seen is their very different attitudes to the concept of adaptation. In Ospovat's analysis, perfect adaptation is described as the central ideological concept in the view of nature prevalent in the first half of the nine- teenth century; in Young's Malthus thesis, the concept of struggle is assigned a similar role, whereas adaptation is treated as an ideo- logically neutral notion. On the other hand, in 'Malthus and the Evolutionists', Young attributed to Paley a significance in the origin of Darwin's theory second only to that of Malthus. Moreover, the analysis outlined in Young's 1973 essay - with the ideological burden of Malthus's argument being laid on the interplay between the notions of harmony and conflict rather than on the concept of struggle per se - might prove useful not only in answering readings such as Bowler's; the same construction might possibly serve as the basis for reconciling Young's interpretation with Ospovat's. Whether or not that is the most effective strategy when attempting to dem- onstrate the ideological importance to Darwin of the theme of conflict in Malthus's Essay after the appearance of Ospovat's reconstruction, the latter's contribution certainly cannot be disregarded. As in the case of the distinction introduced by Vorzimmer and</page><page sequence="34">630 Social Studies of Science Herbert, however, though Young refers to Ospovat's texts, he de- clines to confront the historical analysis presented in them. In a recent text, Young notes that there is a growing consensus that Darwinism was a subtle accommodation within natural theology, rather than a clean break with it. Anyone wishing to take Darwin's mature views outside the context of natural theology has a lot of explaining to do ... 88 The correctness of that statement cannot be called into question, as several historians have successfully challenged the traditional view on Darwinism and Christianity, according to which Darwin's work was unambiguously anti-religious. Both of the two claims that Young made in opposition to this view that there is an essential continuity from Paley's thinking to Darwin's, and that the evolutionary debate was conducted within the context of natural theology have been strongly supported and carried much further in revisionist interpre- tations of this issue.89 Young does not mention, however, that the most influential of these accounts, that advanced by Ospovat, con- tradicts his own Malthus thesis. With regard to another but related point, Young proceeds in a similar manner. Though David Kohn takes a very favourable view of Young's Malthus thesis in his 1980 article, he objects to the charac- terization which Young gives of Lyell's work. In Kohn's view, Lyell accommodated the Malthusian notion of conflict within an har- monious conception of nature just as effectively as did Paley. This is how Kohn concludes his criticism of Young: Thus, rather than reinforcing the impression Darwin derived from Lyell, the key to Malthus's influence was that he destroyed the harmonious interpretation of the balance of nature that Darwin had absorbed as much from Lyell as from Paley.90 In another footnote added to the reissue of 'Malthus and the Evol- utionists', Young replies: 'David Kohn thinks I have Lyell in the wrong group here; I cannot decide'.9' As elsewhere in his recent writings, however, Young is here silent on Ospovat's cognate but much more far-reaching claim namely, that Malthus did not break down Darwin's harmonious assumptions about nature at all.92 In- evitably, Young's silence on this issue undermines the credibility of his Malthus thesis. As a matter of fact, in the face of the noteworthy development that in the meantime has taken place within Darwin historiography, in his</page><page sequence="35">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 631 return to this field in the 1980s, Young abides entirely by his 1969 reading of Malthus's influence, with its 1973 sequel. He has reissued his old essays without substantial revisions, and in his new articles he repeats his former position. Some aspects of the 1969 interpretation of Malthus's influence on Darwin are reiterated in 'Darwinism Is Social', along with remarks reflecting his 1973 emphasis on the har- monious strand in Malthus's work, while in his other recent sub- stantial discussion of Darwin historiography,93 Young describes the link between Malthus and Darwin by encapsulating his Malthus thesis in its original form. But he is more explicit than this in his adherence to his old view of the matter. Consider the following passage, added to one of the footnotes of the republished version of 'Malthus and the Evolutionists': It heartens me to reflect fifteen years after this essay was first written that its main conclusions have stood the test of the most rigorous scholarship in the Darwin manuscripts, although some claim that Darwin's retrospective accounts are not wholly accurate ... Although Young's 1969 construction of the Malthus-Darwin con- nection has not been positively refuted by later studies, and though in an elaborate reconstruction it may well prove possible to retain some of its basic features, the above statement surely conveys a misleading picture of the relationship between Young's 1969 claims and modern Darwin research. Not only is the credibility of Young's Malthus thesis diminished by his failure to confront it with new findings, however; in a certain respect, Young actually weakens his claims. The radicalization of Young's position concerning the nature of Darwin's intentions that occurs in his recent writings means that one important condition for establishing a contextual explanation stronger than that achieved by Young in his early period is fulfilled. Yet a shift in the opposite direction towards a weaker type of contextual link between Mal- thus and Darwin is evident in Young's recent treatment of this issue. In my examination above of Young's early papers, I char- acterized his Malthus thesis as to some extent satisfying the criteria of what was referred to above as the second form of contextualist influence thesis. However, though continuing to draw far-reaching conclusions of it, in recent years Young in effect attenuates his version of the Malthus link into the weakest form of contextual influence explanation. In other words, while still arguing insistently that Dar- win's reading of Malthus's Essay composed a crucial step in his path</page><page sequence="36">632 Social Studies of Science to the theory of natural selection, and while now unambiguously claiming that theory to be imbued with ideology, Young no longer attempts to demonstrate that the latter claim follows from the former. In his most recent material discussion of Darwin history, Young expresses his satisfaction with how modern historians appraise Dar- win's debt to Malthus. The connection between these two thinkers, asserts Young, 'is now firmly established and acknowledged by all reputable scholars'.95 It is true that in the 1970s a consensus was established among Darwin historians as to the importance of Malthus to Darwin's theory of natural selection. Nevertheless, Young here overlooks two things. First, during the last decade, a reverse tendency has set in. The work of Ospovat, and Hodge's and Kohn's collaborative study, are only the most prominent examples of reconstructions in which Darwin's Malthusian insight is considered less decisive than either earlier or later developments of his theoretical views.96 Second, Young extenuates the diversity of opinion that exists with respect to the nature and effects of Malthus's influence on Darwin. No other Darwin historian has emphasized the ideological content of the Malthus link as clearly as Young has; in most in- terpretations, its possible social constituent is either neglected or denied.97 Hence the implication is that the specific nature of that connection is of minor importance. This attitude to the Malthus issue is foreshadowed in Young's early Darwinian papers, as illustrated by his long-standing disregard of the distinction between inter- and intraspecific struggle. In his recent texts such a tendency is much more articulate, however. Young even states that his own reading of what Darwin 'got' from Malthus is remarkably close to inter- pretations of so-called internalists. As I re-examine my own claims and compare them to those of Mayr and Schweber, I am at a loss to understand the difference between us... I have no quarrel with Mayr's claim that 'the role of Malthus was very much that of a crystal tossed into a saturated fluid', nor with Schweber, who says, 'It seems to me that the Notebooks support the view that Darwin was struck with the numerical and deterministic aspects of the Malthusian 98 statement'. With this attitude, Young in fact reduces his own interpretation of Malthus's impact on Darwin's theory to the weakest form of con- textualist influence explanation. Not even de Beer denied that Dar- win's formulation of his evolutionary mechanism was in some way inspired by his reading Malthus's Essay. Consequently, Young dis-</page><page sequence="37">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 633 solves the differences between his own interpretation and those which it was originally intended to attack. Finally, before leaving the historical interpretation of the case of Darwin given by Young in recent years, I wish to return once again to the analogy issue. In the text where Young is most explicit on this topic, the origin of Darwin's central analogy is brought out as one of three pivotal problems in Darwin history the other two being the links to Malthus and Paley. Young even asserts that once it was established that Darwin's concept of natural selection was fund- amentally Malthusian, the remaining issue over which scholars were in doubt was the extent to which Darwin relied on the analogy between that humanocentric concept of nature and actual human selection in the work of breeders, pigeon fanciers, and others. Vigorous attempts have been made to uncouple Darwin's mechanism of evolution from this analogy, but another careful study, L. T. Evans' 'Darwin's Use of the Analogy between Artificial and Natural Selection', con- vincingly answers the critics on that score.99 In the paper to which Young here refers, Limoges', Herbert's and the early Kohn's views on how Darwin formulated his selection analogy are attacked, and an attempt is made at establishing what is basically the traditional account of the origin of the analogy."'0 Paralleling his recent emphasis on the importance of psychological factors to the understanding of Darwin's scientific thinking, Young does not set out to substantiate his claim as to how Darwin found his way to this crucial analogy. Nevertheless, Young's traditional position on the analogy issue, to which he has adhered since 1969, is here in fact given the status of an ideologically significant main thesis. Two reasons for Young's commitment to the traditional view of the genesis of Darwin's central analogy immediately suggest them- selves. If essential aspects of Darwin's description of the workings of nature were determined by his studies of the activities of breeders and horticulturists, then this would be an additional respect in which that celebrated theory makes a notable case in confirmation of Young's general thesis namely, that scientific theories regularly transfer concepts from the social to the natural world."' Undoubtedly, then, the analogy issue may carry great historiographic and ideological weight, and it is quite logical that Young should reject forcefully all attempts to 'uncouple Darwin's mechanism of evolution from this analogy', as in the passage just quoted. 02 But Young miscon- strues the revisionist position on this issue. Though Limoges' reading of the evidence may certainly be characterized as minimizing the</page><page sequence="38">634 Social Studies of Science argumentative value to Darwin of his central analogy, the inter- pretations offered by Herbert, the early Kohn and Ospovat do not call into question the importance of the analogy, but only the traditional construction of its genesis. If Darwin's theorizing remained distinctly non-selectionist during his entire pre-Malthus period, the expositions of his evolutionary theory may nevertheless be completely dependent on the analogy he drew between artificial and natural selection. In other words, provided that the rhetoric and strategy of Darwin's argument is set clearly apart from the path by which he reached his theory, the revisionist account of the origin of the analogy is no less compatible than the traditional one with the claim that the theory of natural selection is inescapably anthropomorphic. Hence the first obvious reason for Young's faithfulness to the traditional position on the analogy question is really a corollary of the second one, which is his general attitude to the relationship between scientific expositions and processes of discovery. In my previous discussion of Young's early Darwinian papers, I noted his failure to explore the discrepancies between private and public levels of science, and his corresponding readiness to trust the accounts proposed in retrospect by the historical subjects themselves. These features are quite as evident in Young's recent texts. To the sociologically oriented criticism of this element in Young's historical method that I offered above, one might add a psychological one. If Young's latter-day acceptance of a psychoanalytic view of human motivation had been integrated with his historical interpretation of the case of Darwin, a more sceptical attitude to Darwin's own accounts of his actions would have been natural. While discussing biographical studies in general, Young himself asks, What can we know? Are we confined to her or his own memories? Are we to trust self-perception? How do we evaluate the judgment of loved ones, friends, enemies? In these matters critical acumen is all.103 Suffice it to say here, then, that the arguments adduced by Young in support of his traditional position on the analogy issue - let alone of his placing it on an equal footing with the ideologically burdened Malthus issue - are far from being compelling. Conclusion It is anything but surprising that a one-time professional historian of</page><page sequence="39">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 635 science, returning after a decade or so to a field to which he has contributed substantially, will be reluctant to revise his earlier find- ings. However, my aim in the previous section is only secondarily to criticize Young for having missed the significance of much subsequent research on those topics that he dealt with himself twenty years ago. The main purpose of my examination of how Young in recent years has defended (and, in some respects, developed further) his early position, is to weigh the merits of one suggestion as to how the interpretation of the historical case of Darwin offered by Young in his early period is related to subsequently proposed reconstructions. Somewhat less explicitly, the same relationship was dealt with in the section where Young's early interpretation of Darwin was assessed. In a certain sense, therefore, this paper is an exercise in whig his- toriography. '04 In the domain of history of science in general, the 1 970s and 1 980s have witnessed a gradual but unmistakable drift in the direction of contextualizing efforts, towards a much higher degree of integration of scientific content and intellectual and social context than achieved earlier. The same drift is evident within Darwin historiography, resulting, for instance, in a raising of the standards for accepting contextual explanations.'05 Even a cursory glance at the trajectories individually followed by scholars such as Manier, Schweber, Ospo- vat, Moore and Kohn suggests the existence of a contextualizing tendency in Darwin studies.'06 In many cases one will find that historians, having been trained and originally having worked in a traditional, entirely internalist manner, gradually acquire a perspec- tive attributing considerable weight to intellectual, social and ideo- logical features of the historical context of Darwin's science. It is important to observe, however, that the contextualizing tendency is much stronger on the level of programmatic statements than it is in the historical argumentation as such. This phenomenon clearly shows that the ambitions on the part of the historians to take the historical context into account are much greater than is their ability to realize them. Many attempts in this direction have been rather faltering; plainly, it has proved difficult to hammer out satisfying methods. This is probably one of the reasons for the chequered quality characteristic of many historical studies on Darwin; within one and the same text, a number of rather different historiographic approaches are often being combined. Young is not at all unique among Darwin scholars, then, in employing an historiography of a relatively complex and irregular nature.</page><page sequence="40">636 Social Studies of Science Two fundamental contextualist strategies may be distinguished in the field of Darwin studies, Young being the chief representative of one of them. Both strategies aim at discerning the social and political in the content of scientific theories; this object, however, may be pursued by following either of two main routes. What is characteristic of the strategy selected by Young is that the ideological debate is treated as primary in relation to the scientific one. Internal and external strands are then concatenated to the extent that features of scientific texts can be shown to be related to or derived from the social world and the political debate. An assumption underlying this mode of procedure is the notion that in the last analysis, everything reduces itself to power relations, codified as economic conditions. Hence the need for a 'theory of mediations between socio-economic base and intellectual superstructure' flexible enough to be able to take account of scientific developments of any kind. '07 The same assumption forms the rationale for Young's reflexive relativism. The crucial shortcoming of Young's strategy is that, owing to the fact that the technical content of the scientific texts are assigned a role secondary to that given to political ideas, the concatenation that it produces between internal and external strands is not a very strong one.'08 The lack of a substantial analysis of Darwin's theory and its development means that the strongest social connections borne out by Young's interpretation do not concern the vital aspects of the theory of natural selection. Rather, they pertain to relatively periph- eral features of the work of the famous naturalist, such as the political reflections that he educes from his own biological theory. The sum and substance of the link to Malthus and the concept of struggle in nature remains ambiguous. Most successful is Young in his natural- ism thesis, where the distance kept in Young's Darwinian work to the technicalities of the theory of natural selection is at its minimum. On the other hand, the theme of naturalism is not at all as central to the understanding of Darwin's science as are some other characteristics of its social and intellectual context. The reason for this is that while subsequent research on the former theme has not yielded insights into the nature of Darwin's biological thinking sharper than those already reached by Young, clearly, such insights have emerged from studies with relevance to the Malthus connection. Young's insistent pro- grammatic claims as to the necessity of analyzing the content of scientific theories and his criticism along these lines of Merton's early work notwithstanding, the difference in that regard between the historiographic approaches employed by these two authors is not one</page><page sequence="41">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 637 of kind, but only one of degree. Indeed, the most serious criticism to be levelled against the historical interpretation of the case of Darwin offered by Young is the very same that he himself has directed against Merton, of whose work Young said: The internal-external dichotomy can never be transcended, since the substance of science is never considered in detail.'09 The greatest merit of Young's historiography lies in the reconstruc- tion of an ideological debate to which British biological thinking of the mid-nineteenth century seems to have been closely related, and which has been completely neglected by most Darwin historians, but only to some degree has Young succeeded in establishing a link between that debate and central aspects of the theory of natural selection. Moreover, quite some effort would be required to reconcile the ideological background painted by Young with the most con- vincing contextual analyses hitherto performed of Darwin's theory, such as Ospovat's. The second main contextualist strategy in Darwin history, which differs less from traditional internalist history of science than does the first one, is characterized by its treating the content of the scientific theories as primary in relation to the context in which they originated. Not surprisingly, this is the strategy chosen by historians who, despite internalist backgrounds, orient their work in the direction of the ideal of contextualizing history of science. I have just referred to the importance claimed by Young of coming to grips with the technical content of scientific texts, if it is to be possible effectively to establish a link between scientific developments and their social conditions. Because Young's programmatic statements to this effect point to such a crucial issue, in its best moments, the second contextualist strategy in Darwin studies definitely proves to be superior to the first one. In other words, if a close analysis of the technical core of Darwin's theoretical views succeeds in revealing the presence of ideological assumptions, then Darwin's science is linked to its social context in a much more convincing way than what seems to be possible to achieve when focusing primarily on the ideological background and ad- vancing from there to the scientific theories. The relationship between explanations referring to aspects internal and external to science, respectively, is a complex one. With reference to the main question addressed in this paper, of how an effective contextualist strategy in Darwin history might be arrived at, this</page><page sequence="42">638 Social Studies of Science relationship may be conceived of in either of two ways. Not un- reasonably, the strength of an internalist explanation of the kind exemplified by Herbert's construal of the historical link from Mal- thus's work to Darwin's - combining the distinction between the concepts of inter- and intraspecific struggle with a revisionist position on the analogy issue - may be regarded as furnishing a sound basis for a contextual interpretation of the same link. Indubitably, if Herbert's reading was to be accepted, a firm connection would be established between Darwin's biological theory and a doctrine of major importance in the ideological battles of nineteenth-century Britain. From this stand, an extension of the explication of the Malthusian influence to its possible social constituents might prove to be within reach. Alternatively, an interpretation suggesting a rather weak internal link from Malthus to Darwin - as when no distinction between different concepts of struggle is made, while at the same time the origin of Darwin's central analogy is understood in the trad- itional manner - may be seen as leaving much wider scope for claims about an ideological component of the historical connection between the two authors. To some extent, this latter conception is outlined in Young's 1969 construction of Malthus's influence on Darwin. Young's reading of the statements on struggle in nature found in the work of Lyell is congruent with the thesis that rather than the concept of struggle per se, it was the ideological function served by that concept in the Malthusian doctrine which gave Darwin the impetus to incorporate it into his biological theorizing. Once an overly respectful attitude to Darwin's position on political matters has been relin- quished, as in Young's recent Darwinian texts, a thesis to that effect might perhaps be defended. Such a claim, of course, would constitute an example of what in this paper has been called the third and strongest type of contextualist influence thesis in the history of sci- ence. It is highly uncertain whether this type of explanation can be sustained with respect to the genesis of Darwin's theory. On the other hand, however, there is no need to retreat to the first and weakest form of contextualizing account; as demonstrated most clearly and cogently by Ospovat, a strong case can be made for a contextual explanation of the second, far more valuable, type. Irrespective of the relative merits of these two competing concep- tions of the relationship between internal and external explanations, I concur wholly with the following passage by Young on how hypo- theses about various kinds of influences on Darwin's thinking should be substantiated:</page><page sequence="43">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 639 The acid test is the close study of Darwin's notebooks, manuscripts, and the marginal notes in his library." This statement conforms with Young's programmatic emphasis on the necessity of understanding the content of the scientific theories studied. More importantly, it agrees with the criterion which provides the basis for the assessment advanced in the present paper of the credibility of Young's concrete historical theses on Darwinian sub- jects. The crucial question with which I have confronted Young's claims concerning specific historical circumstances allegedly im- pinging on, or even determining, Darwin's position on various biological issues as expounded in his main works, is to what extent Young is able to show these connections to be reflected in peculiarities of Darwin's scientific views and in the changes they underwent in the process of his working them out. As this criterion suggests that interpretations referring to social and political forces must be based on close analyses of the technical content of scientific theories, in a certain sense, it implies internal aspects of scientific development to be primary in relation to external ones."' The latter reflection is reminiscent of Lakatos's claim, that rational reconstruction or internal history is primary, external history only sec- ondary, since the most important problems of external history are defined by internal history.' While Lakatos's statement shares some common ground with the central criterion applied in this paper, however, there is also a fun- damental difference between them, stemming from the incongruity between internal aspects, as I have used that term, and Lakatos's concept of internal history. Whereas Lakatos wanted to separate internal history of science as radically as possible from external accounts, the opposite ambition is an obvious premise of the dis- cussion of the present paper. As indicated by his practice as an historian no less than by his 'acid test' idea cited above, Young is far from being entirely critical of close studies of Darwin's private notebooks and manuscripts. Accord- ingly, in one of the articles which Young has published in the last few years, he describes the strong tendency among Darwin scholars to focus their attention on archival material as 'welcome if it were not becoming a near orthodoxy'."3 Still, Young disapproves strongly of the orientation which has been dominant in the field during the 1970s and 1 980s, speaking disparagingly of the Darwin industry as 'burying</page><page sequence="44">640 Social Studies of Science its head in the "texts" '."' As suggested by that phrase, the criticism levelled at current Darwin historiography in Young's recent essays is basically that the heavy emphasis on archival documents has led to a corresponding neglect of the connections between Darwin's scientific views and broad contemporary social issues. Why do we defer to great men in the history of science? Why do we not consider the social processes of scientific change in their broadest contexts? Where have these questions gone in the past decade? In place of these issues, we find that scholars are looking deeper and deeper and in greater and greater detail into the minutiae of Darwin's notes and thought processes."5 This description is not wholly misleading. A large portion of Darwin studies deals exclusively with strictly scientific and narrowly ac- ademic themes in Darwin's manuscripts and in the writings of his contemporaries, completely ignoring the social reality that influenced and was influenced by the theoretical debates. Yet the dichotomy between manuscript studies and contextualizing efforts inherent in Young's criticism is too simple. We do not have to choose between cognition and context: sometimes it is possible to see the horizon clearly from within the dustiest archives. Young overlooks the fact that in some of the most meticulous reconstructions of Darwin's path to his mature views, links have been established between his bio- logical theory and important aspects of its social and ideological context. In these studies a contextualist strategy differing from that applied by Young is put into practice. In fact, recent scholarship indicates that this strategy provides empirical support for the con- textualist thesis propounded by Young on a programmatic level more effectively than his own historiographic approach is capable of doing. That is another way of stating that the criticism presented in the present paper is not directed at Young's general contextualist view on science; on the contrary, in its essentials, I find that position most reasonable. But although Young's essays have served a crucial func- tion in calling attention to the political and ideological setting in which Darwin's theory was conceived and made public, historians who wish to pursue that theme further would be well advised to view the manner in which Young argues his specific theses on these subjects with considerable suspicion.</page><page sequence="45">Bohlin: Young &amp; Darwin Historiography 641 *NOTES This text is based on a paper presented at the XVIIIth International Congress of History of Science, 1-9 August 1989, Hamburg and Munich.

But the criticism of self-contradiction, which Larry Laudan has directed primarily at Collins, is mistaken. That charge stems from Laudan's tacitly assuming that identical positions must be taken on both of the two levels involved. See L. Laudan, 'A Note on Collins's Blend of Relativism and Empiricism', Social Studies of Science, Vol. 12 (1982), 131-32, to which Collins, op. cit. note 8, is a reply.</page><page sequence="46">642 Social Studies of Science 10.

For proponents of rationalist and internalist accounts of science, on the other hand, the epistemological status of one's own explanation is not problematic, since quite consistently, it can be argued to be as rational as the cases on ground level which they purportedly explain. 12.

Jonathan Hodge criticizes Young in a similar manner in his 'Darwin as a Lifelong Generation Theorist', in Kohn, op. cit note 1, 207-43, at 238-39. Young accepts that criticism in his 'Life Among the Mediations: Labour, Groups, Breasts', talk delivered to the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge, 20 February 1986, 10b. 38. The best study dealing with this aspect of British natural history is probably D. E. Allen, The Naturalist in Britain. A Social History (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1976). S. Herbert, 'The Place of Man in the Development of Darwin's Theory of Transmutation, Part I', Journal of the History of Biology, Vol.7 (1974),217-58, and M. Ruse, The Darwvinian Revolution (Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press, 1979), are among the studies on Darwin which include some reflections on institutional factors. 39. The development of natural history in the nineteenth century is used to explain Darwin's thinking in, for instance, Ruse, op. cit. note 38, and D. Ospovat, The Development of Darwvin s TheorY. Natural History, Natural Theology, and Natural Selection, 1838-1859 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981). 40. This aspect is investigated, for example, in M. J. S. Rudwick, 'Darwin and Glen Roy: A "Great Failure" in Scientific Method?', Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, Vol. 5 (1974), 97-185; M. Ruse, 'Darwin's Debt to Philosophy: An Examination of the Influence of the Philosophical Ideas of John F. W.

Herbert, 'The Place of Man in the Development of Darwin's Theory of Transmutation, Part II', Journal of the History of Biology, Vol. 10 (1 977), 155-227; and E. Manier, The Young Darwvin and His Cultural Circle (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1978). 41. Young defends this aspect of his methodology in his (1980), op. cit. note 12, 73- 74. 42. This kind of analysis is offered in A. Desmond, The Politics of Evolution (Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press, 1989). 43. This has been emphasized, among others, by P. B. Medawar, The Art of the Soluble (London: Methuen, 1967), and M. D. Grmek, 'A Plea for Freeing the History of Scientific Discoveries from Myth', in Grmek, R. S. Cohen and G. Cimino (eds), On Scientific Discovery (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1981), 9-42. 44. In the case of Darwin, such discrepancies have been investigated primarily by M. J. S. Rudwick, 'Charles Darwin in London: The Integration of Public and Private Science', Isis, Vol. 73 ( 1982), 186-206; Manier, op. cit. note 40; E.

Among studies having appeared too late for Young to have been able to respond to them in the two substantial discussions that his return to Darwin historiography in the 1980s yielded, the most important ones are probably F. Erskine, Darwin in Context. The London Years. 1837-1842 (unpublished PhD thesis, The Open University, 1987); and D. Kohn, 'Darwin's Ambiguity: The Secularization of Biological Meaning', British Journalfor the History of Science, Vol. 22 (1989), 215-39. Both of these studies are admirable examples of contextualizing historiography. The former text raises the same kind of problems to Young's Malthus thesis that Bowler brought up, albeit in a much more convincing manner. 84. Young (1969), op. cit. note 5, 118. 85. In fact, Kohn takes one further step in the direction of accentuating the unique character of Malthus's Essay, when stating that 'Without Malthus, and especially without reading the man's own passionate words, Darwin's insight . . . would have been all but impossible': Kohn, op. cit. note 69, 145. 86. D.L. LeMahieu, 'Malthus and the Theology of Scarcity', Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 40 (1979), 467-74, at 473. 87. Young (1985), op. cit. note 5, 252, note 25.2. Without mention of Bowler's name, the same point is made in Young, op. cit. note 50, 610, and in Young, 'Persons, Organisms and . . . Primary Qualities', in Moore (ed.), op. cit. note 61, 375-401, at 379. 88. Young, op. cit. note 50, 615. 89. The leading representatives of this important development are J.R. Moore, The Post-Darwinian Controversies (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979); N. Gillespie, Charles Darwin and the Problem of Creation (Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press, 1979); Ospovat, op. cit. note 39; J.H.

Kohn, op. cit. note 69, 169, note 137. 91. Young (1985), op. cit. note 5, 255, note 31.1. But Young has nowhere revised his old position on this matter; rather, judging from the comments on the concept of struggle in Lyell's work given in his op. cit. note 50, 621 and 634, he has decided to stick to his original view, after all. 92. In his op. cit. note 83, Kohn takes issue with Ospovat on this and related aspects of his interpretation. 93. Young, op. cit. note 10, 212-13. 94. Young (1985), op. cit. note 5, 255, note 48.1. 95.

Evans, 'Darwin's Use of the Analogy between Artificial and Natural Selection', Journal of the History of Biology, Vol. 17 (1984), 113-40. 101. This is how the effects of Darwin's associating with commercial breeders is described by A. Sandow, 'Social Factors in the Origin of Darwinism', Quarterly Review of Biology, Vol. 13 (1938), 315-26, and M. Mulkay, Science and the Sociology of Knowledge (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1979), 101-04; the latter bases his argument chiefly on Young's essays. The proponents of this position have been ill served by the only thorough studies having been devoted to Darwin's contacts with breeders and fanciers, however, as no attempt is made there at accounting for important features of Darwin's theoretical views: see J. Secord, 'Nature's Fancy: Charles Darwin and the Breeding of Pigeons', Isis, Vol. 72 (1981), 163-86, and Secord, 'Darwin and the Breeders: A Social History', in Kohn, op. cit. note 1, 519-42. 102. It should be noted, however, that the link between Darwin and those experienced in practising artificial selection has also been construed as challenging the importance of the Malthus connection. According to Mayr, op. cit. note 97, 492-93, it was from the breeders, not from Malthus, that Darwin derived his focus on individuals. Given the internalist direction of Mayr's work, it is hardly surprising that he develops this conception in the manner typical of the weakest form of contextual explanation. 103. Young, op. cit. note 10, 204. 104. As Young's work is here judged against the standards set by what are, in my opinion, the best studies on Darwin hitherto presented, many weaknesses to which I call attention may well point to tasks that, twenty years ago, were hardly possible to carry out. Nor are they necessarily tasks that Young would have wanted to accomplish. Hence Young has responded to an earlier version of this paper by stating that he does not think of himself 'as a failed archival scholar but as a philosopher and ideologue who does much more homework than most' (personal communication). Similarly, on my criticism that while in recent texts he describes the theory of natural selection as inherently ideological, he no longer attempts to show this to be a consequence of Malthus's influence on Darwin, Young remarks that he does want to retain that connection, adding that he has not 'intentionally attempted to weaken or attenuate' his Malthus thesis. Young's intentions, however, are not at issue here. 105. As noted by Timothy Lenoir in an overview of this field: 'Essay Review: The Darwin Industry', Journal of the History of Biology, Vol. 20 (1987), 115-30, at 119-20. 106. Compare, for example, Manier, op. cit. note 40, and Manier (1980), op. cit.</page><page sequence="52">648 Social Studies of Science note 44, with Manier (1987), op. cit. note 44; Schweber, op. cit. note 76, and Schweber, 'The Genesis of Natural Selection -- 1838: Some Further Insights', BioScience, Vol. 28 (1978), 321-26, with Schweber, op. cit. note 96, and Schweber, 'Essay Review: The Correspondence of the Young Darwin', Journal of the History of Biology, Vol. 21 (1988), 50 1-19; Ospovat, op. cit. notes 79 and 80 with Ospovat, op. cit. note 39; Moore, op. cit. note 89 with Moore, op. cit. note 62; J.R. Moore, 'Darwin of Down: The Evolutionist as Squarson-Naturalist', in Kohn, op. cit. note 1, 435-81, and Moore, op. cit. note 61; or Kohn, op. cit. note 69 with Kohn, op. cit. note 83. 107. Young, op. cit. note 4, 387. 108. I am not alone in taking this attitude to Young's Darwinian work. This kind of criticism of Young has previously been set forth by T. Kuhn, 'The Relations Between History and History of Science', Daedalus, Vol. 100 (1971), 271-304, at 281-82 and note 6, 301-02; by La Vergata, op. cit. note 1, 952-53; and by J. Golinski, 'Lost in Mediation: The Social Component of Darwin's Science', History of the Human Sciences, Vol.2 (1989), 95-103. The first one of these authors has been responded to by Young: see his op. cit. note 4, 408-13, where an efficient contextualist criticism of Kuhn's historiography is offered. As to Kuhn's objections to his own approach, however, Young offers no real answer. 109. Young, op. cit. note 4, 416. 110. Young (1985), op. cit. note 5, 255, note 48.1. 111. The same view is taken by Oldroyd, op. cit. note 1, 336-37, and Erskine, op. cit. note 83, 10-11. 112. I. Lakatos, 'History of Science and Its Rational Reconstructions', in R. C. Buck and R. S. Cohen (eds), Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Vol. VIII (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1971), 91-136, at 105. 113. Young, op. cit. note 50, 635. 114. Young (1985), op. cit. note 5, xvi. 115.

Ingemar Bohlin is at the Department of Theory of Science, University of Goteborg, working on a PhD thesis, the preliminary title of which is 'Theory and Ideology of Darwin Historiography'. In addition, he is working on a project concerned with the political and economic setting of contemporary polar science. He is spending the academic year 1 991 /92 as a visiting researcher at the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge.
