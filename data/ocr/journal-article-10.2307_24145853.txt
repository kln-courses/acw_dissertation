<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mzima: Portrait of a Spring 30 min. $595 ($60 rental/. Benchmark Films, PO Box 315, Franklin Lakes, N] 074 J 7. Mzima: Portrait of a Spring depicts the interdependence of animals in a unique biological community, a lush African spring in an otherwise arid region. We learn that the spring is a complex aqua tic community and a watering area for many animals. The film traces the food webs of the community and de scribes the niches of many inverte brates. Hippos, crocodiles, cormorants, tur tles, frogs, and fish populate the film, which also compares predators, scaven gers, and herbivores as well as cold and warm-blooded animals. The photography is superb, with exciting underwater footage. The theme of interdependence is appro priate for high school biology students, but anthropomorphism sometimes detracts from the ecological message. No teacher materials are provided with this revision of a 55-minute film. Mark S. Garland</page></plain_text>
