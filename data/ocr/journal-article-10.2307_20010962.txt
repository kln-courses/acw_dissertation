The conversion of self in everyday life ANDREW TRAVERS Department of Sociology, University of Exeter, Amory Building, Rennes Drive, Exeter EX4 4RJ, UK He [Lee Harvey Oswald] walked through empty downtown Dallas, empty Sunday in the heat and light. He felt the loneliness he always hated to admit to, a vaster isolation than Russia, stranger dreams, a dead white glare burning down. He wanted to carry himself with a clear sense of role, make a move one time that was not disappointed. He walked in the shadows of insurance towers and bank buildings. He thought the only end to isolation was to reach the point where he was no longer separated from the true struggles that went on around him. The name we give this point is history. (DeLillo, 1989:248) The argument Goffman's belief in a sociology of interaction alienates him from his chosen phenomena, but it is through his alienation that Goffman discovers his guiding principle of a ritual interaction order maintained by the selves it constitutes. Paradoxically, Goffman's analysis of interactional alienation then deconstructs the selves that are the ritual regulators of interaction. Thus Goffman's ritual theory, mirroring his experience of interaction, collapses into its own alienation, but only so far. The famous presentation of-self thesis, for example, is a precarious thesis of false selves stabilized (a) by Goffman's persuasive style, (b) by selves that can have little interac? tive development, and (c) by the "rules" of interaction. When interactants are understood as sincerely acted selves that are highly sensitive to their appreciation, they are very much more dramaturgical than Goffman allows. Breaking Goffman's sociological ice, such interactants can free themselves as self-credibilizing conversions of prior and presenting selves, who of course will face further conversions in future interactions.</page><page sequence="2">170 Failure of the self to be converted is experienced as anguish, which is formally the same as Goffman's alienation from interaction but experien tially intolerable. Successful conversion, by contrast, revokes the interac tant's prior and presenting selves, though often without the tragic awareness that further conversion is every next interaction's possibility. Arriving in a relativistic epoch of human contingency, self-converting selves are postmodern selves. The more they are hooked on interaction, the more they are converted. The less they are converted, the less human they are. L Introduction This paper contributes to the study of face-to-face interaction by developing Erving Goffman's "presentation-of-self thesis." The intensified "self that results from Goffman's developed thesis is more interactive than Goffman's self. Focused as an indispensable but intangible interactional reference this intensified self is nevertheless detached from interaction by a distance that, in analysis and in the life that is analysed, is precisely the detour of its particular account. And the straight line to the self's focus now need have no correspondence to the account's narrative line. Closing the gap between a neo-Goffmanian self (or the idea of this self) and the experience of having and being such a self is, therefore, the work of opening the gap as wide as the analysis is long. However, analysis often demonstrates in advance that which it is trying to achieve, producing interim selves as substitutes for what a self would be beyond reasonable doubt. Interim selves are like the selves of everyday life, justifying and vindicating themselves, suffering threats of selflessness, and easily identifying with other selves seen as such face-to-face or on TV or in every variety of story. Any interaction and any interaction analysis can only ever be a deconstructive or ethnomethodological postponement of a finally focused self. Deconstruction preserves the self by hating it (Berman, 1988:171-223). But ethnomethodological self-work, such as this paper, escalates the presence and the reality of a hypothetical self while divorcing it from selves accounted in the terms of psychobiology or, indeed, from any other accountable self, since no other account is this one. Indispensable selves will be seen, later, as irrefutable conversions-to-self of interactants under the duress of becoming more than they can realisti? cally seem to be. These are the Western selves that Buddhists approach from the other side of logocentric meaning by equally fanatical conversions-from-self. Just as Buddhist meditational practice backs an enlightened adept into a transfigured space, so the paradigm Western self</page><page sequence="3">171 (Aristotle's tragic male actor), trained, rehearsed, and contrived as a poignant perfection of spontaneity, walks forwards into the very same transfigured space, purging audiences with pity and terror, if the actor gets is right. In the logic of this paper all interactants are preoccupied with getting themselves right in pursuance - usually without their knowing it - of charismatic selves. Thus charisma in everyday life, when everyday life is experienced as engrossing (as it must be in interaction), may be said to flow from the body seen as irresistibly meaningful. In what follows, the method of developing Goffman's presentation-of self thesis to support such reflections as the above is to argue with Goff? man, and at times to elaborate by employing an analogy derived from a theory of self-transformation cults (Cushman, 1986). The argument as a whole amplifies Goffman's "hybrid" discourse of self, strengthens his ritual frame, and expands the presentation-of-self thesis into a "conversion-of-self thesis." To introduce the argument I now briefly explain Goffman's presentation of-self thesis before discussing its hybrid discourse and centralizing Goff? man's ritual frame (la, lb). Following that I look at Goffman's "cynicism" (lc). Then (2a, 2b, 2c) I locate my paper in a particular epistemological space. Finally I suggest how a ritual order of interaction might produce indexical selves constructed like the indexical "accounts" of ethnomethodol? ogy (3a, 3b, 3c). 1. From presentation of self to conversion of self (a) Concerning the presentation of self in every day life. Goffman (1971a:244-245) says that in an interaction the presentation of selves (the management of both direct expressions and "given off impres? sions) is the circular process of selves defining the interaction that at the same time defines the interactants' selves. Instead of a two-step "self-self interaction (the symbolic interactionist model), Goffman (1953:33-41; 1972a; 1983; Rawls, 1987; 1989a) proposes the three steps of "self-interaction-self," whose core is a sui generis interaction order. Goffman's "self is interactionally organized in a fluid way that need neither directly answer to dynamics of a sui generis self nor to a self's estranged symbolic mediations. Yet his self is only functional for the interaction (and for interaction analysis) if it does not appear to be wholly interaction-dependent, as I argue in 1(b). This is a more complicated proposal than is generally acknowledged, and it is the presentation-of-self thesis that I shall develop into a conversion-of-self thesis. The exact range of my theoretical register can be seen in comparison to</page><page sequence="4">172 (i) the social construction of Harr? and (ii) symbolic interactionist prag? matics. My "conversion" accommodates Harr?'s (M?hlhausler and Harr?, 1990:127) account (i) of self as "doubly indexical," emerging both "from the fact of human embodiment" and "from the way that responsibility for actions is assigned to the moral order of the local society." But my sense of "local society" is confined to a particular interaction wherein I say that the self ritually depends on more than "the grammar of our language" (ibid: 18). My account would accept that "the transcendental ego is a shadow cast on the world by grammar" (ibid: 18) but would extend the sense of grammar to include Goffman's ritual idiom that is "spoken" by bodies and by the experiential "I" alongside the Meadian "me." In my register, the transcen? dental shadow self of grammar actually would be fused with variably conscious embodiment. This differs from a symbolic interactionist account (ii) where the ritual demands of interaction are seen as constraints on non ritual selves (Rock, 1979:128-131). My Goffmanian frame of joint involve? ment in interaction is the precondition for selves, not merely the conscious? ness of selves understanding what is going on. Further, I take the "simplifying typification of the 'me' that is the pivot of all transactions" (ibid: 124) to be the discrete intellection of a co-present self plus the current legibility of frame in which interactants read their selves. These differences, however, are only analytic, since interactants' enormous sense-making aptitudes can find truth in every extant theory of self. I shift the analytic emphases of (i) and (ii) so as to direct my argument to submerged features of self that have been deprived of a fertile salience. Two unintended consequences of this are that I understate the symbolic mediations of language and project the unusual idea that consciousness in interaction is both the property of separate interactants and a communal apprehending. (b) The hybrid discourse of self. Goffman's (1953:103-104; 1981a:21) presentation-of-self thesis is as? sociated with his celebrated book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, but in less strategic form it recurs throughout his oeuvre, repeatedly phrased in the terms of his dominant "ritual frame." Immediately after this Introduction (in Section II), I substantiate a ritual Goffman, and then recast his presentation-of-self thesis ritually before going on in the main body of the paper to convert it to my even more ritually powerful hypothesis. But I shall not lose the Goffman interactant in the process. For, like the interac tant of the presentation-of-self thesis, the interactant of the conversion-of self thesis still presents his or her self when converting to that self, though not necessarily in an inwardly "harried" manner (Goffman, 1971a:228). The</page><page sequence="5">173 apparently minor difference between the two theses does open, however, major issues. A strong motive for converting Goffman's thesis is his truncated treat? ment of selves. Goffman devotes much of his sociology to developing a theory of interaction as a ritual order. But he has difficulty re-inserting selves into his ritual order, even though this order is ritual because its interactants are morally responsible to it as selves. Unsuccessfully attempt? ing to purge his analytic discourse of vernacular points of view, Goffman elides the self. I suggest that the hybrid discourse Goffman does not escape is a formal sociological incapacity to transform "essentially psychological facts of human life by means of an abstraction into form and content" (Smith, 1989:31). The incapacity is as follows. Goffman's interactions protect their order from offending selves with cultural and fashion-responsive codes of interaction-constitutive reparation. But that means nothing unless Goffman uses both vernacular and analytic meanings of self. Goffmanian selves are, and have to be, our taken-for granted understandings of selves. At the same time the order of a Goffman interaction is its Simmelian "formal" sociological analysis (Smith, 1989). Throughout Goffman, selves are deeply of a person's psychobiology (cultural selves) while seeming to be entirely interaction-dependent (formal sociological selves), and the formal selves only acquire their formal importance if also thought of as cultural selves. What is more, the reception of Goffman's oeuvre suggests that his sociology of interaction is fully interactive with readers only if the interaction-dependent selves are evoked in conjunction with their cultural-psychobiological resources. That is why, in my opinion, the self in Goffman's more analytic mature sociology is an increasingly attenuated category. And that is also why, when Goffman concentrates on the ritual order of interaction, selves are neglected. More to the point of this paper, the tension of the hybrid dis? course explains why, when Goffman concentrates on selves, as in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, the order and the rituality of interac? tion are neglected. I put selves back into a ritual frame (a) because I do not believe that Goff? man's ritual order will continue to be sociologically productive without selves as we know them, and (b) because I do not believe that interaction analysts, any more than other people, can succeed in believing that they interact minus a sense that they have, or are, discrete selves. The latter point has bearing on the very possibility of studying interac? tion live. Without a sociologist self, "who," while interacting, studies "what?" And, of course, with a sociologist self, can one fail to offend by naturalistically observing while interacting? (I think not, and I think that</page><page sequence="6">174 that is Goffman's belief, arrived at simultaneously with his discovery of ritual offence in his dissertation.) But those questions belong to a separate discussion (see Travers 1991; forthcoming). With that discussion deferred, my style straddles cultural and sociologi? cal realms. It develops the very phenomenon that, if it lost its indispensable sense of cultural-psychological reference, would disappear. Yet it is the interactional demand for cultural-psychobiological reference that initiates a sociological meaning so far largely absent from the study of interaction. The phenomenon developed in this dialectic is "conversion," which I come to by working "inside" Goffman. Because this phenomenon is still too undefined, it undercuts any inclination to "hold" it in analysis and subverts the formal sociology it provokes. But there is a further connected reason - already touched on - for reuniting selves with the ritual order of interaction. The reason is this. If - as Goffman says - interactions are partially constituted by the reparative ritual conduct of offenders, interaction needs responsible interactants. Such responsible interactants have to be selves, since self is the (everyday and sociological) category with whom interac? tants find fault and by whom fault is found. As late as "Radio Talk," this is still Goffman's (1981b:325) position: What the speaker is engaged in doing ... moment to moment through the course of die discourse in which he finds himself, is to meet whatever occurs by sustaining or changing footing. And by and large, it seems he selects that footing which provides him the least self-threatening position in the circumstances, or, differently phrased, the most defensible align? ment he can muster. It is a self who is blamed for an offence, and a self who takes the blame, and a self who, having taken offence, puts the blame on an offending self. One might very nearly say - as does Foucault - that the forms of blame (or of anticipation of blame) are the means by which people know what selves they have. (Goffman hardly ever suggests that praise can conjure self, but obviously congratulations and honours and appreciation can confirm selves perceived to deserve such.) Goffman's ritual order, then, cannot be a ritual order unless it retains selves, and the more ritual the order the more vital the selves. The question of a blameable self (constructed by ritual interaction and its analysis) raises deeper questions concerning both the ultimate range of Goff? man's different perspectives on interaction and the proscribed range of each perspective. Miller (1986), for example, lifts Goffman's "self out of the metaphor system of The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life and finds it guilty of Humean category mistakes, and Miller is convincing except for thinking that one cannot give both Hume and Kant the slip by ascribing</page><page sequence="7">175 agency to the performance of a self (as I do in Sections VII and VIII). In a fare more sensitive reading of Goffman, and in reply to Miller, Manning (1988; 1989a) advocates Goffman as a detached theory-player who should not be read as projecting a single Goffmanian self beyond each of his separate perspectives. The purpose of Goffman's successive accounts, according to Manning, is to critique the relevant perspectival frame as well as to account selves therein (and sometimes accounting the self is not Goff? man's declared task.) So it is wrong to extract a unified self-theory from a unified Goffman oeuvre. However, I do not think that Goffman's ubiquitious ritual frame is just another of Manning's perspectives, and certainly Goffman never tests it to destruction, nor ever tests it. In whatever perspective and metaphor system he is working, Goffman also has interactants as ritual beings for whom the self is a sacred category projected ethnoritually as an ideal that experience (interactants' and Goffman's) has to relate to if it is to feel that it is human experience. This is the self that is not, contra Miller, Humean, and which Goffman knows, in Kant's words "cannot be thought as such through empirical data" (quoted in Miller, 1986:193). Manning (1988:63) too alludes to it when discussing role-distance" "[S]elf exists not as an ac? cumulation of roles, but in their midst, between them." This self even insinuates itself into Goffman's (1981b:325) late "production format" (in "Radio Talk"): it is a received cultural self of the widest perspective which gives meaning to the adjectival construction "self-threatening." In Goffman and in the interaction order that he studies there is just no getting past Randall Collins' (1986:187) blunt assertion that: "We are compelled to have an individual self, not because we actually have one but because social interaction requires us to act as if we do." If the self is always ritual and if the ritual frame is the condition for social meaning in a Durkheimian way, one can read Goffman, I think, as deconstructing all the perspectives that fail the ritual test. Out of these successive deconstructions a self arises that I see as unifying Goffman and his oeuvre about his unmediated experience of interaction. And each perspective is a failed escape because it is betrayed by an analytic language made analytic by its vernacular verve. (c) Goffman's analytic sincerity and its backlash of cynicism. Goffman's understanding of self zigzags between the vernacular and the analytic. It never comes to rest between their respective theses of "sincerity of belief versus "alienation from interaction." The trace of the zigzagging is Goffman's rogue sociology, inaugurating sociology's first major paradigm shift in alignment to a fully-relativized but fully-ritualized Durkheim. Early in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1971a:28-32) Goff</page><page sequence="8">176 man deals with "the individual's own belief in the impression of reality he attempts to engender" (ibid:28). Citing Harry Stack Sullivan, Robert Park, Howard Becker and Blanche Geer, his own Shetland study, and Kroeber on shamans, Goffman conceives a "continuum" or "cycle" of cynicism sincerity. The sincere performer, he says, is "fully taken in" (ibid:28) by what the performer stages as "the real reality" (ibid:28), while the cynical performer, sometimes knowing that the audience would not believe a sincere performance, is not taken in at all. Goffman notes that, as careers progress, novitiate cynicism may become mature sincerity. Then he chops from talking about careers to talking about interaction, and suddenly exposes the kernel of The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1971a:31-32): We find that the individual may attempt to induce the audience to judge him and the situation in a particular way, and he may seek this judgement as an ultimate end in itself, and he may not completely believe that he deserves the valuation of self which he asks for or that the impression of reality which he fosters is valid. Here Goffman catches the vacillation of an interactant's belief in his or her "front." But Goffman vacillates too, from sincerity to cynicism, from an interactant's view that certainty is internally and externally threatened to a formal sociological view that the threats to certainty render the certainty analytically unreal. Goffman's (1971a:28) appreciation of the "sincere" vernacular view is put like this: When his [the interactant's] audience is also convinced in this way [the belief in performance is sincere] about the show he puts on - and that seems to be the typical case - then for the moment at least, only the sociologist or the socially disgruntled will have any doubts about the "realness" of what is presented. The opposing cynical view appears elsewhere in Goffman (1972b: 117) as what I am calling his alienation-from-interaction thesis: If we take conjoint spontaneous involvement in a topic of conversation as a point of reference, we shall find that alienation from it is common indeed. Joint involvement appears to be a fragile thing, with standard points of weakness and decay, a precarious unsteady state that is likely at any time to lead the individual into some form of alienation. In these two passages we find the contradicting poles of Goffman's hybrid discourse. Vernacular certainty confronts the analytical certainty that vernacular certainty is a "precarious unsteady state." When he becomes analytical, Goffman has to abandon the certainty of his own belief in sincerity and adopt the cynical "socially disgruntled" (sociologist's)</page><page sequence="9">177 position of disbelief. His discourse then refuses to be taken in. It renounces sincere belief (Goffman's own vernacular proto-conversion thesis) in order to sociologize itself analytically. This is what Goffman says sociology has to do, and what he then starts to believe interactants also do but, obviously, in their case without the visible production of his analysis. Later (in Sections V, VI and VII) I show how Goffman is unable to make his analytic account express his vernacular findings without producing paradoxes that I shall be trying to resolve. My style of exploration, as I have indicated, is much the same as Goffman's, but with a resistance to the kind of formal analytic theory that confounds its own experiential grounds. I work on Goffman's analysis so as to make it both more analytic and more vernacular. In effect, I tighten the hybrid screw. This style of course is open to criticism. But it is also open to the phenomenon it analyses. Moreover, while Goffman's formal sociology of alienation is in his own terms "cynical" (not "taken in"), mine is not. To an extent, mine is "taken in" by the phenomenon, the better, I believe, to understand it. My reading of sincerity and cynicism in Goffman reverses Waksler's. Unlike Waksler (1989:7-10), I am, to borrow her words, definitely shooting the messenger (Goffman) for writing the very message he conveys - that interactants are structurally cynical. In my view, Goffman's cynicism - in his analytic meaning of the term - is welded to his admirable sociological sincerity inside the order of interaction that he charts virtually de novo. For example, the stance of naturalistic observer within an interaction where interactants must "not be too good at acting" (Goffman, 1969:44) is offensive when the observer's observing goes unobserved (acting in this sense is too successful dissimulation, not transportative dramaturgy). Goff? man's serious problem here - apart from his immorality in the name of sociology's "superior" immorality - is that as a covert observer and a prospective analyst he guarantees for himself an interactional experience coloured by the fear of detection. Whether or not Goffman's interactional experience is representative, it does, I think, result in an unwarranted stress on detachment, alienation, and stilted rather than effervescent acting. Ironically, of course, Goffman's skewing the "data" in that way is how we have that "data" to begin with. Goffman sees no need to resolve the dilemma of "cynicism of analysis" versus "sincerity of interactant," but never forgets the irresolution. As early as 1953 he is writing of the Shetland residents that they "would not readily accept as friend and neighbour ... someone [himself] who showed an unnatural interest in matters of that kind [social interaction]" (p. 5). Much later in Frame Analysis (1975:14) the same sentiment surfaces in the notorious passage: "I can only suggest that he who would combat false consciousness and awaken people to their true interests has much to do,</page><page sequence="10">178 because the sleep is very deep. And I do not intend here to provide a lullaby but merely to sneak in and watch the way the people snore." Goffman in both quotes is convinced that observation equals private-eye surveillance, and he accepts that the subjects are right to dislike it. Thus Goffman is a sincere cynic healing his rupture from other people with an analysis that they actually find true, only then to also find them? selves put in Goffman's position. There is no sense, however, to Davis' (1973) assertion that Goffman falls on the "Martian" side of Davis' opposed "Martian" and "Convert" fieldworker types. Unlike the Martian, Goffman has plenty of assumptions in the field, often taken from Simmel and Durkheim, and these prevent him from being a Convert to the mores he studies. Productively fastened to an inner sociological sincerity which must expose people as dangerous manipulators of their appearances, Goffman engenders himself textually as "anybody," and he seems aware, without ever putting it into words, that there are only more or less powerful selves to convert to or dissociate from, whether these be Martians, Converts, positivists, ethnomethodologists, or those who will have none of any of them (I enlarge on this in Section XV). While performing as a sociologist better than most sociologists, Goffman is beyond the discipline, which, as it were, falls away behind his prose like spent booster rockets as he travels from Mars to Earth through ordinary people going the other way under the gravitational pull of an expert professional discourse that - in Davis too - would somehow survive the internal contradiction of Martian versus Convert by synthesizing the two - as a sort of unreflecting pragmatism - in disregard of the internal contradictions of each one. Throughout this paper I synthesize two "faces" of Goffman's hybrid discourse. I say that Goffman's analysis is both analytic and vernacular, and then I seem to jump to the conclusion that Goffman's experience of interaction must also be both analytic and vernacular (with the inner moral imperative of being analytic prevailing over the external moral imperative to perform as a competent interactant). Have I the right to talk about Goff? man's experience at all? Have I, really, only the right to talk about his discourse as text? The answer depends upon what is meant by discourse. I follow Ricoeur (1971) and read discourse as productive of worlds that are then imaginatively re-experienced. My Goffman writes directly out of the heart of interaction as if, when he writes, he is broadcasting live. It makes sense, then, for me to see through the Goffman discourse to as-if-realler worlds and at the same time to note that the discourse is also text. This method of reading avoids structuralizing and post-structuralizing the text, and also avoids misrepresenting Goffman's phenomenon as facts that have been transcribed or, in positivist language, reported objectively. In the Ricoeurian way of reading, the matter that the text is "about" is about the</page><page sequence="11">179 reader as much as it is about Goffman. Ricoeur argues that, only if this is reading, can there be, between human beings, communication that is more than transfers of information between senders and receivers self-constructed as nothing but cognitive machines. 2. Method of the paper (a) A strategy for remembering Goffman. Throughout the paper - despite Ricoeur - I talk of interaction as other theorists might talk of class or culture or institution or family, as if it is a social fact, as if it can be accounted "finally," as if this instance of account? ing is not itself caught in an interactional system. There is no other intel? ligible way of characterizing a phenomenon, just as there is no advantage in refusing to go on talking about "phenomena." Further, I rarely specify the context, members, duration, or institutional purpose, if any, of the interac? tions I discuss. I argue at a general level, typifying conditions said to be possible in any interaction. In this respect my precedent is Goffman in essays like "Alienation from Interaction," though one can find similar precedents in Blumer and Mead, as well as in Garfinkel's summary state? ments about accountability, background expectancies, common sense knowledge of social structures, artful practices, and so on (Garfinkel, 1967:Ch 1). Since my argument with Goffman is conducted so as to make him say more than he appears to say about the self in interaction, the views ex? pressed, at a certain point, become mine rather than Goffman's, though my views remain dependent on Goffman's. I proceed by examining interaction as it develops from the "recruitment" of the interactants through a stage of mutual alienation and then up to the "conversion" of interactants to the selves that their interaction allows them to be as they themselves perform the interaction. These stages of develop? ment revise and enlarge Goffman's "presentation," and in defrosting its 1950s "cool" give it a chance of growing into a more lifelike theorem, with deeper feelings. But I do not go far beyond Goffman. Rather I extend the "scaffolding" of The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life on a Goffmanian variant of his ground plan. And I do this by building into his ritual frame an analogy taken from Cushman's social-psychological study of self-transfor? mation cults. (b) Arguing by analogy. The purpose of an analogy is to sharpen and deepen perception. The analogy I use in this paper is the "conversion career" derived by Cushman</page><page sequence="12">180 (1986) from his study of brainwashed recruits to cults. Cushman is actually dealing with self-transformation wrought by a sequence of interactions, and nowhere does he imply that a convert's career can be collapsed into a single interaction, let alone hypothesized for every interaction. Moreover, Cush? man's recruits to conversion have abnormal pathologies. But an analogy is an analogy, whose justification would involve my showing it in use and making appeals for its suitability, which would be the same as using it. One step further back, a broader justification for theorizing by analogy is made by Brown (1977:84-85) when he describes an analogic model as a kind of metaphor that "creates an image by contrast or comparison" and "shows what a thing is like." According to Brown, the "counterfactual truth" of the analogy "cannot be literalized or disengaged without destroying the insight which metaphor provides" (ibid:84-85). Thus, since all representations are "symbolically mediated" (ibid:32), since "all knowledge is metaphoric" (ibid:77), since metaphor "constitutes its own data" (ibid:97), and since "[t]here are no criteria for comparing metaphors with some absolute reality" (ibid:99), my analogical use of Cushman's typology must be a species of Brown's "symbolic realism," intended by me to accrue from readers the reality that readers might come to through it. (c) But what am I doing? I regard interaction as a profound sociological topic-and-resource because reflections upon it at the highest levels of abstraction nonetheless strongly engage with experience of everyday life, no less often outside than inside the frames of research projects. Wittgenstein's (1958) observations on language use, Sartre's (1957) denunciations of being-in-itself, eth? nomethodology's breaching practices (Garfinkel, 1967), immerse one in a feeling of life being lived. Severely philosophical propositions transform immediate social reality, and draw from that reality. So it is when reading Goffman: readers' experiences of life, like Goffman's, become Goffman's veracious data (Tudor, 1982:169). With due modesty I hope that this paper too can procure from its readers the "empirical" import without which theory, however vernacular, is sterile, and in keeping with the paper's conversion thesis I wish not only for the sufficient agreement that would maintain my credibility but also to interact with or convert the reader, yet without disarming creative disagreement of the kind I have with Goffman. Such disagreement one day might come from fieldwork. Meanwhile, because my argument operates at a high level of abstraction both within the Goffman corpus and from outside that corpus (via the aforesaid analogic model), I am not writing a research report so much as an essay in philosophi? cal anthropology. But, for the reasons given in the previous paragraph and set out more fully by Andrew Tudor (1982), I feel that the paper is also</page><page sequence="13">181 bound to be subtextually ethnographical. Such is my hermeneutic method here of rewriting Goffman as a postmodernist. 3. Sociological relevances of the conversion of self (a) Towards a reflexive ritual self. I wish not only to instate the social phenomenon of interactional self conversion in more detail than hitherto but to persuade sociologists that something I call "ethnorituality," catalysed by that phenomenon, could become a sociological programme. Firstly, converting Goffman's presentation-of-self thesis to a conversion of-self thesis underlines the ritual dimension of a typical Goffman interac? tion. This rescues Goffman's interaction theory from the impression he fosters in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life that self presentation is not a life-or-death affair. Secondly, there follows from the conversion-of-self thesis a renewed emphasis on the interactional nature of both the self and human belief, the ritual accent of this emphasis, as I have said, distinguishing it from sym? bolic interactionist accounts. (Where Blumer's and Mead's interactants take one another into consideration, Goffman's (1953:103) also give and receive ritual consideration, and, updating Goffman, postmodern "conversion" interactants reflexively ritualize their selves.) (b) What is ethnorituality? Just as ethnomethodology, cleaving to members' practices, begins to discover how all arguments about social reality might work, so a neo-Goff manian theory of interaction, through its sensitivity to interactional selfhood and to the sense of the "real" in interaction, offers the prospect of explain? ing how interactants display humanity. The heirs of a Goffman-Garfinkel merger may be, therefore, the true legatees of Durkheim's (1965; Rawls, 1989b)1 polemical assertion that all experience and all being are social. (Mead too anticipates Goffman and Garfinkel but he has a weaker sense of both the pitiless compulsion and the weightlessness of "seen but unnoticed" consensualities. And, for his part, Marx can envisage no other form for human beings than that dictated by exchange- and signifier-value (D'Amico, 1981), eventually to be overthrown by a proletarian conscious? ness that Baudrillard (1975, 1981) describes as an ironic and sarcastic truth effect of both capitalism and Marxism.) As Rawls (1989b) expresses this situation, there emerges directly out of the classical theorists, through Goffman and Garfinkel, a middleground in which questions of subjectivity and objectivity, of relativism and realism,</page><page sequence="14">182 vanish. In Rawls' account, social meanings are interactionally-achieved, progressive realizations of institutional and other accountability frameworks. (It would follow that positivist and interpretive theories, and their epistemologies, should not be treated as correspondence accounts of social reality but as resources for interaction sociology.) I would go further than Rawls by suggesting that the self and "humanity" - the one feeds the other - are also interactional achievements whose understanding, no less than the understanding of the artful practices of objectivity management, must be as-if-empirically sociological. But, though we have the word ethnomethodology to describe reflexive artful manage? ment of indexicality into objectivity, we have no word for similarly reflexive artful conversions of ritual faces and fronts into identities as selves. I would like to coin for the study of these conversions the term "ethnorituality." The proposal of ethnorituality as a sociological programme suggests itself here. (c) In search of membership. A running assumption of this paper is that the interacting self - much more so than Mead's - is qualitatively incommensurate with the self apart from its interactions with others. I abide by Goffman's intuition that there is no clear continuity between selves prior to interaction and selves in interaction, and add my own intuition that much of interaction is the work of invisibiliz ing discontinuities and opacities. Obviously, therefore, this paper, like any actual interactant, dwells on the disjuncture between an interacting self and taken-for-granted cultural selves. The work of the paper then, despite itself, is more work of invisibilizing discontinuities and opacities. It is an example of the ethnoritual work by which, I maintain, members of a society achieve membership. Historically, if this work reflects a widespread anxiety vis-? vis proper membership of a relevant society, it seeks membership prospec tively in a society it can only imagine. Though I feel that I have not traduced Goffman in what follows, I cannot swear that I have not made interpretive mistakes. This is for the reader to decide, but no mistake could diminish the force of my argument, which in the event of mistaken interpretation would be an argument with someone who is not Goffman but who would be, just like the "real" Goffman, a hypothesis based on text. Worse, I feel that I know Goffman well enough to reinterpret my mistake(s) as improved interpretation or, if the worse came to the worst, as Harold Bloom's "misprision." And how can we not agree - in the melancholy radiance of Goffman's interaction theory - that "[w]hat the text means now matters more than what the author meant when he wrote it" (Ricoeur, 1976:30)? It might be objected that I am moving in a direction that Goffman does</page><page sequence="15">183 not choose to follow because he has other interests. To this I would say that Goffman's central interest is the study of face-to-face interaction, and that in such a domain the self is indispensable. So I prefer to think that my difference is not of direction but of emphasis. Instead of obeying structural imperatives at the cost of experience, I stay with experience at the cost of structural rules and laws. This is empiricism in the demise of an empirically demonstrable "reality-without-parenthesis" (Maturana, 1988). n. Goffman's presentation-of-self thesis Before I develop my argument, I preview some aspects of Goffmanian ritual interaction with which the Cushman conversion analogy - which I describe as I apply it - is sympathetic. Goffman (1972c:44) defines interactants as "self-regulating participants" of interaction who need "to be perceptive, to have feelings attached to self and a self expressed through face, to have pride, honor, and dignity, to have considerateness, to have tact and a certain amount of poise". Interactants' self-regulation is governed by a morality of conduct whose rules "are effective (in so far as they are) because those to whom they apply believe them to be right and come to conceive of themselves both in terms of who and what it is that compliance allows them to be and in terms of what deviation implies they have become" (1972d:127). Indeed: "[T]he ritual frame provides a question that can be asked of anything occurring during talk and a way of accounting for what does occur" (198 la: 17). Interactants, then, create their selves with exclusive reference to ritual perceptions. Selves (or ritual beings) are selves because they are seen to be human, but it must follow, if selves are principally transceiving faces of moral "entities," that an interactant's "essential" humanity is not any specific presentation. What is human is, rather, "the competency to produce these portraits [self presentations], and interpret those produced by others" (1979:7), and "[i]n the main, what exists are doctrines regarding expression, gestural equip? ment for providing displays, and stable motives for encouraging certain imputations" (1975:462). Or, slightly differently (as early as 1953), human expression meets interactional demands as a fluent moral response tactfully designed to "unresponsively" and indexically objectify itself: In this study it is assumed that the emotional expression practised by the members of a particular group is determined by the moral rules recognized in the group regarding social interaction. The member must not only learn when and how to express his emotions, but is morally obliged to express them in this way.... It is suggested here that emotional</page><page sequence="16">184 expression is a reliable index because persons have been taught to act in such a way as to confirm the fiction that emotional response is an unguarded instinctive response to the situation. (1953:59-60) Further, the "requirements established in the ritual organization of social encounters" (1972c:45) dictate the moral rules whose interactional incarna? tion "transforms him [the interactant] into a human being" (1972c:45). And at all times "we are socialized to confirm our own hypotheses about our natures" (1979:7): our social life entails "a constant checking back to, and reminder of, a small number of central beliefs about the rights and character of persons" (1972d:172), for "ordinary conduct ... is an imitation of the proprieties, a gesture at the exemplary forms..." (1975:562). Therefore those whose lay or sociological analysis shows them to be human are human because they "have learned to comport themselves so as to render this analysis true of them" (1975:563). Thus Goffman's selves are ritually defined in interaction, qualifying as selves by appearing to be naturally human. Their humanity, however, is not related to their discrete presentations but to the interactants' competency to morally enact a variation on whatever is the prevailing definition of a proper human being (it must be a variation if the proper definition entails the idea that each self is unique). The enactments or presentations are an orderly stream of interactional hypotheses to which interactants conform and which they confirm as if referring to an essential human nature that I have termed their respective indispensable moral foci-in-progress. Ritually, then, the presentation-of-self thesis can be expressed like this: Selves are ritual performers of cultural desiderata who constitute interac? tions from which they flow as if from the individual interactants. They are moral epiphenomena of moral commitments to orderly interaction. The manner and the interactional responsiveness of their presentations is their substance. At this point many of us would want to say that there is more to a self than that. But the "more" can only be real if it can manifest itself credibly in interaction. For if the more is not interactive, not social, it is unknown and unknowable. And as soon as an unknowable self emerges it is engaged in interaction. Within a single interactant interactional emergence is described by Mead in his formula "I-me," and how the unknown "more" may become a mutual reality is described by Gurevitch (1988; 1989).2 Goffman's ritual selves do tend in their reader's apprehension to have greater moment than their static presentations, as if they are struggling to convert themselves into fuller selves in ways that Goffman only analyses as their "remedial" work when desacralized. But Goffman regards selves' rituality as a constant quantity simply to be restored when lost. If interaction is going smoothly, Goffman's rituality does not seek self-enhancement. But</page><page sequence="17">185 rituality, as I have argued elsewhere (Travers, 1982), may be a variable that, in larger quantities, can be perceived as charismatic or, in smaller quan? tities, as muted and shallow. So, while Goffman's presented self tries to remain a constant ritual quantity, the converted self runs back and forth along the axis of less to more rituality. This review of rituality ought to be related to a recent debate that has developed between Goffmanians and Conversation Analysits. The debate addresses the priority that interaction analysts should accord rituality. Ritual system and CAfs system constraints Goffman (1981a:21) is clear that the ritual and system constraints of interaction cannot be separated. Conversation Analysts nonetheless claim that system underlies ritual (Schegloff, 1988). But late Goffman's systemic deconstruction of the interactant (into figure, animator, strategist, and author), together with the systemic capacity of a single interactant to perform as a set of interchangeable speakers, deconstruct CA's "speaker" (Manning, 1989b). In the absence of ritual interactants who can each have a discrete self, CA is left with no sure footings for the intelligibility its conversations construct. Plainly the issue here is self. CA cannot ritualize its speakers without flunking its programme of discovering - "beneath" ritual, and in technical language - how interactants create their epistemologi cal ground, for that would mean that CA would have to work with and in interactants' "vernacular culture" (Schegloff's term), as does Goffman. Like background expectancies or accounts, selves are phenomena that "always escape" (Silverman, 1989). But whereas CA tries to formalize ethnomethodology's interest in routine grounds, neo-Goffmanian eth? norituality would study interactional phenomena with unsparing devotion to vernacular meanings of ritual ideas like charm, coldness, disdain, friendli? ness, and so on. Ethnorituality would include the study of such phenomena as dirty looks and false smiles (as well as eyes that "stare right back to God" and smiles that "warm the heart"), which nonverbal phenomena are difficult to catch in CA's theoretical programme. In studying ritual attribu? tions such as charm, ethnorituality would say more and more about selves, always of course seeking to integrate this material with the relevant analyses of ethnomethodology and CA. To this programme Schegloff would repeat his strictures on Goffman and say that you cannot know a ritual phenomenon without first knowing the system that contextualizes it. I would then say to Schegloff that selves construct their systems with ongoing determinative reference to ritual perceptions that are intelligible</page><page sequence="18">186 alongside system structures. Ritual system in my sense is an epistemology of constructed humanity in apposition to constructed objectivity. These issues are complex and deserve closer attention. I do not mean to dispose of them here but to further orient the reader to the "self that I shall inevitably constitute as I go along, and which in its turn will inform the "implied author" (Booth, 1961) of this paper. However, as a parting shot, I must say that the debate between Goffmanians and Conversation Analysts itself must be conducted in a different discourse to that specified by CA for the analysis of tape transcripts. It is fraught with vernacular meanings. And the legitimate horror of Schegloff and others to Goffman's use of fabricated dialogue in his late "talk" papers epitomizes that issue. Goffman does not jettison his vernacular, top-of-the-head examples even in the midst of difficult technical argument. Perhaps he knew exactly what he was doing, that is, maintaining his authorial presence as a representative interactant in constrast to the self-less scientist of Schegloff's and Sacks' aspirations. HI. The nature of belief in self My argument hinges on the sense interactants might have that they can believe in their selves. What do I mean here by belief? To be consistent, I lean heavily on Goffman's recommendations. Belief that a certain jointly sustained interactional reality is more real than any? thing else is Goffman's (1975) bedrock. This is straight out of William James and Alfred Schutz. As does Goffman, James and Schutz define reality as an interest-generated world whose credibility is a function of the interest in it. Goffman's departure from that position - his not awarding Schutz's "working world" a preferential status - enables him to be as polemically sociological as Durkheim. The move is a powerful strike for a sociology that will know more of philosophy than philosophy can know. Goffman (1975:347) says: "... a reader's involvement in an episode in a novel is in a relevant sense the same as his involvement in a strip of 'actual' experience. When James and Schutz spoke of something being 'real after its fashion' and of 'multiple realities,' it was potential for inducing engross? ment that they really had in mind." Here "real" means only what is real for an interacting person, and the credibility of reality is therefore its power to engross. Goffmanian belief is a state of being that is isomorphic with what is perceived, though obviously to various degrees, ranging from slight interest to uncritical absorption. In Goffman we no longer have the philosophical either/or of belief/disbelief but a continuum of belief which restores to phrases like "I couldn't believe my eyes" their rich experience of self-revision. The above definition of belief couples perception and engrossment as a</page><page sequence="19">187 major criterion for the credibility of worlds, and Goffman brilliantly dovetails the two in his concept of frame.3 A Goffman frame is both the organization governing an event and the organization of persons' subjective involvements in that event. The frame is organized so as to be perceived, and its organization of what is perceived is the perception. A frame is "what is going on" for interactants, what they "get caught up in, engrossed in, carried away by" (ibid:6), what a person is "alive to at a particular moment" (ibid:8). All frames "provide engrossables - engrossing materials in which observers can get carried away, materials which generate a realm of being" (ibid:57). So, in an interaction, what is not framed is not real (is Goffman's "negative experience"), and cannot therefore be believed. But, since the interaction reality of a frame is con? stituted by the selves it constitutes, selves are believed to be real in the same way that frames are believed to be real. The key to belief, by way of Goffman's frame analysis, is thus interac? tants' unthinking engrossment and involvement in Garfinkel's "seen but unnoticed" background expectancies. This is "a psychobiological process in which the subject becomes at least partly unaware of his feelings and his cognitive attention" (ibid:346). Because the self is constitutive of frame and because frame is reality, selves are as believable as "what" is going on, and they are no more believable than that. Those selves that resist a frame either change that frame or are changed by it, in either case passing through alienation from interaction, when they feel unreal, anomic, unbelievable. The conversion of self, as I shall show, is the process of making a self internally and externally believable in interaction. The presentation of self, by contrast, does not exact of its interactant any more than the belief in its expediency for a given situation, as if a more believable self, "wearing a single look, a naked unsocialized look, a look of concentration, a look of one who is privately engaged in a difficult, treacherous task" (Goffman, 1971a:228), is its constant companion. The restless semantics of this constant companionship herald my argument with Goffman. IV. The self as an interactional conversion syndrome: Recruits A self - I claim - functions interactionally as a self-constituting intel? ligibility, real in so far as it is an indispensable and meaningful moral reference. This is to start off with a sharp distinction between the self as an "action" referent and a self reducible to its psychobiological "motion." Kenneth Burke (1968:447) endorses such a distinction with his argument that in the study of human beings a focus on their motion (as opposed to</page><page sequence="20">188 their actions) will end up dehumanizing them, making them, in effect, beside their point: Within the practically limitless range of scenes (or motivating situations) in terms of which human action can be defined and studied, there is one over-all dramatistic distinction as regards the widening or narrowing of circumference. This is the distinction between "action" and "sheer motion." "Action" is a term for the kind of behavior possible to a typically symbol-using animal (such as man) in contrast with extrasym bolic or non-symbolic operations of nature. The distinction ["between a 'thing' and its name"] is generalized in dramatism as one between "sheer motion" and "action." It involves an empirical shift of circumference in the sense that although man's ability to speak depends upon the existence of speechless nature, the existence of speechless nature does not depend on man's ability to speak. The relation between these two distinct terministic realms can be summed up in three propositions: (1) There can be no action without motion - that is, even the "symbolic action" of pure thought requires corresponding motions of the brain. (2) There can be motion without action. (For instance, the motions of the tides, of sunlight, of growth and decay.) (3) Action is not reducible to terms of motion. To the degree that it is real (or engrossing), a self is therefore effectively charismatic because it does not exist except between selves that do not exist as things. And self is continuously brought off by a face (Goffman, 1972c) sympathetically improvising on shared corpora it also selectively and creatively animates. All real-feeling selves are believed in by themselves but, as Goffman says, they are interaction-dependent. Interaction, therefore, has to be able to generate for each interactant a wholly credible self, one with whom the interactant could identify as if it represented a perduring interaction independent self. Were the self not so identified with, it would not be believed to be the real self. It would be a kind of false self. There is an important consequence, beyond feeling unreal, of an interac? tant's failure to believe in his or her self, and this is implicit in the morality of interaction. A false self making no effort to become truer, when it believes that it is believed by others to be true, is not only unreal but immoral. This is because its unreality implicates reciprocally constitutive selves who are present through moral commitment to moral rules of proper self-production. (By way of an aside, I would suggest that Goffman's "self as performer" in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life seems immoral to Gouldner (1970) and to Maclntyre (1984), among others, because it is not dramatic enough to have more than strategic truth. It does not suffi</page><page sequence="21">189 ciently believe in itself. It has no soul (Psathas, 1977) or its soul is buried like Job's (Creelan, 1984), or it is haunted by a "naked unsocialized" other who also haunts reciprocal interactants, preying upon them as an interest perhaps malevolently undeclared.) But there can be benign false selves. These are dramaturgically believed in for the sake of interactions such as games or staged plays, or the deadly mechanical operations of alienated labour. Their falsity is benign because interactants would disown false selves under moral pressure of more urgently definitive frames. However, it is assumed here that an interactant has only one self - not necessarily the one whom he or she thinks he or she is -'that the interactant cannot disown, however many different faces this self can wear. The "ultimate" self would be the unalienated product either of exceptionally moralistic interaction or of interaction experienced as deeply immoral. The opposite of this ultimate self is the malign false self. This is an interactional self that, with no restraint of the offensiveness it can get away with, puts its internal self-serving morality before the morality of interaction, acquiring a "working" reality in proportion to its unreproved impertinence. In our culture such selves may strut and fret with impunity when backed by institutional power or terror. I return to the topic of false selves in Section VII. How does belief in self come about? How can interactants believe that they are selves? Those are my central questions, whose answer will be the contention that interactants come to believe in themselves as selves through a conversion experience, this being of uncredited beginning-interactants ("recruits") to accredited interactors ("converts"). Cushman's analogy My conversion analysis analogizes Cushman's (1986) moral career of recruitment and indoctrination in self-transformation cults, several hundred of which, studied over a period of nine years, inform Cushman's theory. As I conduct my argument I collapse Cushman's interaction-sequence into one "ideal" recruitment-indoctrination interaction. The arbitrary assumption is that Cushman's typical cult group has the same processual form as an interaction. Obviously this is like starting with a conclusion. But the conclusion will not be arbitrary if the incorporation and organization of material that could not exist without the analogy persuasively amplifies the given Goffman corpus which, in its own way, is arbitrary too, as arbitrary as Durkheim, as arbitrary as Simmel, as arbitrary as Mead. An introduction to the "Cushman conversion interaction" is overdue. Interactions (Cushman conversion interactions) are closed, exclusive</page><page sequence="22">190 worlds in which all communications are controlled through rites that trade on supernatural validation. Members of these worlds find themselves strung out and reaching for a perfection of ordained self-realization that cannot be achieved. The cost of failure is guilt and shame, but the guilt and shame may be relieved by an experiential dissociation from the shameful self when that dissociation is accompanied by credulous prostration before an omnis? cient interaction ideology. Direct critique of the ideology is prohibited while questions and scepticism are rebutted with thought-terminating clich?s quoted from doctrines that are often attributed to divine authority, and always regarded as more real and valid than any actual human ex? perience. A typical everyday thought-terminating clich? in most families with young children would be, in answer to children's demands for reasons why they must do this instead of that: "Because I say so." Here the doctrine that parental authority is absolute is well hidden, though the quasi-divine authority is overwhelming. (Pollner [1987:Ch 6] notes that all accounts will have "privileged self-exemption," but he does not consider the aggressive interactional possibilities of this characteristic.) In the Cushman conversion interaction, where existence is dispensable, fears of self extinction - and this is Cushman's major finding - can be overcome by brainwashed merging with the currently irrefutable interaction reality. The recruit has to keep saying and really meaning slogans like "My country right or wrong" or "Death before dishonour" in order not to turn to jelly. That is the Cushman conversion interaction in which the belief that interaction is other than the lived resolution of acute personal risks is precisely the kind of belief interaction encourages in order to stay possible as a seamless routine achievement not worth the alienative estrangement of analysis. Of course, I am saying that analytically, but not more analytically than Cushman or those who are cynical with regard to cult practices of self transformation. I now begin to apply the Cushman analogy directly to interaction. Recruitment to interaction At the outset of an interaction each interactant has come from the produc? tion order of another interaction. For sense to be made - and it has to be made, as senselessness is ideologically unthinkable - interactants must instantly transform themselves into sense-producers for and of one another. This phase is Cushman's "recruitment," which precedes indoctrination. In Goffman (1975:9) the how of recruitment is skated over despite his claim: "[T]he fact that participants seem to have no trouble in quickly</page><page sequence="23">191 coming to the same apparent understanding in this matter does not deny the intellectual importance of our trying to find out what this apparent consen? sus consists of and how it is established." Goffman's interactants present selves and interact almost as if their interaction reality is shared from the very start. They seem to learn what is going on without Schutz's "shock" and without much reorientation. They are a very far cry from Sartrean selves who experience the sudden look of an other as the violent end of freedom. My view is that, though interactants must know instantly what is going on, the interaction is started by a precipitous initial "selving." But Goffman's recruitment is not only glossed. It is at odds with his "alienation from interaction" thesis. By opening out Goffman's alienation in the next section I generate paradoxes for Goffman that in ensuing sections will prompt a switch of rhetoric to account interactants less as rule-referential strategists than as selves performed as takeovers of the psychobiology. This paves the way to a more coherent account of the alienation that precedes and necessitates the recruit's conversion. In due course my rhetoric will indicate conversion by showing how interactants interact not only with reference to interaction rules but also in accord with their feeling for their selves' credibility. Though such playing of selves is susceptible to analysis in rule terms, a rule-analysis conceals the requisite analytic positioning of Goffman's "commitment to interaction." And commitment to interaction, I contend, is a function of moral en? thusiasm as well as a matter of cool obedience to, or disobedience of, morality. V. Goffman's over-compression of recruitment Goffman (1972b: 134) says that alienation from interaction is "the statistical rule." Despite his developed idea of "involvement" in interaction (1953:353; 1963:194), Goffman wants to believe that interaction is a system that tends not to deliver wholehearted selves but to open its heart to a surgical sociological eye. This is Goffman working as a Simmelian formal sociologist. However, Goffman's analytic idea of a "detachment" that reciprocates with involvement constantly veers towards a universal aliena? tion. But, if involvement is accounted in terms of a detachment identified as alienation, paradoxes result. These are never resolved by Goffman, and possibly they cannot be by formal sociological analysis. Only in "Communication Conduct in an Island Community," Behavior in Public Places, and Frame Analysis is Goffman's detachment regularly mitigated by "unthinking" involvement, but then the analysis is of the interaction system rather than of its dependent but constitutive selves, and</page><page sequence="24">192 Goffman's interpretation of "unthinking" is slanted towards its moral "incompetence" rather than to the wondrous behavioural coordination revealed by Birdwhistell (1970) and Scheflen (1972). Whenever selves make their appearance in Goffman there is a subtle insistence that they are unlikely to be comfortable and are likely to be experienced as travesties that must survive a hostile environment. Generally, in Goffman, the only sure involvement of the interactants is the direction their involvement is going in (the travelling framative focus) and their sense of distance from this. Thus Goffman (1953:40) says that in Shetland (during his 1949-51 fieldwork there) "it is often better to conceive of interaction not as a scene of harmony but as an arrangement for pursuing a cold war." The "war" stays "cold" only because interactants as selves have a "temporary truce" (ibid:40). But the truce of the jointly involved selves is "a fragile thing" (Goffman, 1972b: 117), "a precarious unsteady state" (ibid: 117) that therefore may only sustain precarious selves.4 Goffman's alienation from interaction is contradictory. It requires that at any given moment an interactant does not fully believe in a projected self just because that self is too beset with difficulties of projection. But the interaction of the self is a crucially real reality, and as a reality must be really believed in. Moreover, any show of disbelief is offensive. So the interactant has to be fully believable as a real self of the interaction, or the interaction - this is Goffman's view - will collapse. And yet, alienated, the interactant's self is unreal. So Goffman paradoxically has to say that the interactant who is alienated (inside his or her attributed self and against it) still has an unalienated sense of that self's reality. (The parology here should not be seen as consistently displayed by Goffman. For example, the exception case of "negative experience" in Frame Analysis restates Goff? man's sincere belief that there can be sincere belief. But, at his most analytic, Goffman is paradoxical.) A crude rejoinder to Goffman's assertion that alienation from interaction is the statistical rule is that alienation is "alienation from," or a powerful negative reference to that which does not feel alienating. So an interactant would have to know what an unalienating reality felt like before arriving at the feeling of being alienated from it. I will come back to this in Section XIII ("Goffman's Neglect of Euphoria"), and for the moment only refer to Goffman's alienation at the start of an interaction. Goffman speaks of a "truce" between alienated selves. In The Presenta? tion of Self in Everyday Life (197la: 173) the term gains illicit strength by being posited for complementary groups of interactants, but the meaning is the same here as in the dissertation, though not so delicately employed (since it should also apply between interactants within the "councils of war" mentioned below):</page><page sequence="25">193 It may be true that backstage activity often takes the form of a council of war, but when two teams meet on the field of interaction it seems that they generally do not meet for peace or for war. They meet under a temporary truce, a working consensus, in order to get their business done. But a truce depends on a spontaneous involvement in its negotiation before it can be observed, and the "negotiating" involvement, whatever its nature, cannot be alienating. This means that the truce itself is unalienated even if it produces alienation, and that the more alienation the truce produces the more unalienated the truce will have to be. Further, if a truce were alienated it would not be a truce. It would imply another truce behind itself, and, if that were alienated, another one behind that, and so on in infinite regress. Of course, selves that negotiate their truce need not resemble the selves that observe it, but neither can they be percep? tually dissociated from those selves (as different selves), or there would be no truce between them. Spelt out, this says: alienated from interaction the interactant certainly might become during the observation of a coordinated truce, but alienated the interactant cannot become until the truce itself looks believable, nor remain unless the truce remains overridingly real. In yet other words: to get to the point of being able to be alienated from interaction an interactant has to believe in a self that can then believe in its alienation. And this self is the paradoxical interactional product of this (alienating) interaction, only becoming alienated after becoming interactionally selved in the system of this interaction. So Goffman's vernacular position with respect to his glossed recruitment phase ("... no trouble in quickly coming to the same understanding...") cannot be read forwards into his analytic alienation thesis. Also, reading back from my reformulation of Goffman's truce between alienated interac? tants, we can see that, during the slice of time when Goffman's interactants seem to have no trouble in quickly coming to the same understanding, there is no alienation in Goffman's meaning of the word, even though there must be if interaction is as precarious as he says it is. That too is paradoxical. In any case, alienated interacting asks interactants - who are seen as selves - to be so involved with one another and their interaction, somehow, that they can generate their interlocking alienations. The impropability of interlocking alienations - which cannot accom? modate interaction's requisite belief- is my focus in the next section, where I am led to a first consideration of Goffman's stance both in interaction and in its analysis.</page><page sequence="26">194 VI. Involvement in alienation The predicament of the alienated Goffman interactant is "I can't get involved with that involvingness that's going on," not "I can't involve because there is nothing involving going on." Internally confuted by his or her spontaneous-seeming involvement in interaction, the interactant, according to Goffman, is alienated from a real reality that his or her alienation helps to sustain at a strength or involvement pitch that by sheer contrast shows the degree of alienation from it. Alienation from interaction in this form of words is the living proof of selves' psychobiological involvement in interaction. Yet Goffman says that interaction is fragile, and therefore, for the interactants, deconstructive of presented selves. Not only that but Goffman's precarious selves are bound together by a truce that selves of this precariousness would be incapable of negotiating. Now one must ask again how Goffman can know that seeming is not being. How can he believe his statistical rule that in interaction there is no credible and compelling truth, but only alienation? Let us remind ourselves of the full version of Goffman's (1972b: 117) statistical rule: If we take conjoint spontaneous involvement in a topic of conversation as a point of reference, we shall find that alienation from it is common indeed. Joint involvement appears to be a fragile thing, with standard points of weakness and decay, a precarious unsteady state that is likely at any time to lead the individual into some form of alienation. This is a deductive analytic perception, entailed in Goffman's formal sociological discussion. It need not be true of all, or any, interaction experience. But can we say that Goffman's alienation does not square with a live fieldwork perception? Can we deny alienation as readily as Goffman affirms it? We are in a dilemma where all reports of reporting interactants must interact with us, face to face or text to reader, posing the same problem by living the dilemma of seeming-being (of seeming to be seeming to be, or seeming to be being what they seem) even as they talk about their seeming and their being. So our reports are no better than Goffman's. The dilemma is only opened wider when we think about the demand on interactants - alienated or euphoric - that they do not over-involve (Goff? man, 1975:350-359), for holding back from over-involvement seems to guarantee an inner, detached monitor or a secret, parallel consciousness. Goffman's detachment, which is there to prevent interactional mayhem, can only reinforce the alienated paradox-self that in Goffman's interaction analysis always springs to life as the obverse of the self seen as a "dramatic effect" (Goffman, 1971a:245).</page><page sequence="27">195 The paradox-self, Goffman's alienated strategist, is his bane. It is alienated by being strategic about seeming unstrategic, and it is also alienated because it is not interacting - it is secret - even though, as we have seen, its whole composition, brought into being through detachment, is interactive within the relevant interaction.5 Or is there no secret paradox-self but only the self who is alienated? But if there is no secret paradox-self how can the alienated self know its alienation even as it lives the credibility of its interaction? As it were, how can a false consciousness know that it is false except from the vantage of truth elsewhere? And if this "truth elsewhere" is Goffman's analysis, how can he know that other interactants share its formal structure, especially as he does not share their interactions without always being their naturalistic observer? Goffman perceives interactional alienation from the point of view of an analysis essayed as an even greater detachment from interaction than that of non-sociologist selves. In effect he says that interaction as seen through his sociology must be how interaction is experienced. Theorizing alienation from interaction in an analysis that need not be typical of interactants, Goff? man is unable not to directly qualify interactants' experience with the term alienation. Nevertheless we can only oppose Goffman in an alternative analysis, which again need not be typical of interactants, but which may be more credible. The credibility will be our belief in it as interactants whose analytic rotation of such matters is the centrifuge that separates out our sociologist selves. So how are we going to sociologically escape the incoherence of aliena? tion, which flourishes in the paralogy of having to believe in that which one knows to be false? (Note that the paralogy is forced to the surface not only by my inclusion of selves but also by my frame-analytical insistence on belief in interaction.) My answer eventually will be the thesis of conversion, but now I shall rewrite the Goffman interactant as a dramatic actor in order to recover a coherent interactional self and refine the meaning of interac? tional alienation. (But do not be too quickly convinced by my argument. Goffman could go back into his alienation and say that, even though it is borne of selves experiencing the difficulties of projection, those selves, swimming in alienation, do cohere in an intermittent way. I would then have to say that intermittency is not enough, and claim that disappearing selves are not experienced as such unless the interaction is disintegrating into a concatena? tion of discrete interactions. This is to say that disintegration is not our interactional experience, because we have perduring ritual perceptions. Here I put all my money on the self as an indispensable "final" moral reference, and bridge the gaps of poor self definition with the hypothesis</page><page sequence="28">196 that self references are default references. Default reference means "always there" in lieu of supportive representations, if there has been sufficient ritual experience of such representation, and, therefore, anticipation of more such representation.) If alienation is selfless, is it conscious? I would say that alienation is the pain of being falsified by a reality towards whose falsifying power painful consciousness responds with a hopeful feeling that the real is false. But continuous alienation would not be able to think. It has to either believe that the real is true, when it is not alienated, or believe that it is an alienated self, when it is not Goffman's alienation. So the ability to withstand the anguish of genuinely selfless alienation itself argues self as an agent of resistance. Pure anguish, then, is a self devouring monster that only a self can devour, closely resembling Hilbert's (1986) ethnomethodological reading of Durkheim's anomie as "reality withdrawal," but in my case involving "self withdrawal" as well. Vu. Switching out the Goffmanian strategist: The interactant as dramatic actor Starting from scratch with the idea of a dramatic actor, one can cut out the paradox of "disbelief in believable interaction." Goffman wishes to appreciate conduct as rule-constituted, but this is not our habitual appreciation of everyday performance (Wittgenstein, 1958:paras 201-206). As Phil Manning (1989b:371) says: Our ability to manipulate norms of behaviour is a severe test of sociol? ogy's ability to describe even a single example of face-to-face interac? tion. Interpretation seems to rest instead on a non-formalizable and less tangible faculty, that of judgment. Goffman resisted this conclusion, choosing instead to insert the formalization of rules of social interaction as a regulative ideal. Manning's "judgement," I think, is a form of the appreciation we have for effective dramaturgy, and, if self is analytically projected through this rather than plucked from the interstices of a structured rule system, it can become more ritual - to satisfy the ritual order - and less alienated. Goff? man's regulative ideal is not a shot albatross, however, but now a little less ideal and little less regulative, making way for a concurrent regulative ideal - the self as dramatic actor - built out of belief. Dramaturgic competence will point two ways, inwards to the interactant and outwards to the audience. When the actor feels that the performance of self is poor, it will be difficult for the actor to feel that he or she is credible, and it will also be difficult for him or her to believe in an audience that finds the performance credible. If, on the other hand, it is the audience who</page><page sequence="29">197 find the self to be poorly performed, then they will have difficulty in believing in its reality and the poorly performed self will be in danger of not even being appreciated as a self. Clearly many interactants will be unaware of their performative reality, and some will feel much realler than they look, while others will feel far less real than they appear to be. If selves are postulated as dramatic actors of themselves in this way, as they are in the early pages of The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, their incredibility becomes a function of their poor acting. Thus selves as dramatic actors of themselves, when aware of performing badly, try to act better in order to continue being morally responsible in interaction. Trying to act better is, I suggest, not only a question of referring more assiduously to the ritual rules of interaction but also of dramatically realizing a truer seeming self. Now we can say that it is the actor's insufficient belief in the self being played that transfers some of the actor's consciousness to a minimally involving virtual self, whose internal presence is not dwelt in as a secure haven but compensated by better, truer acting. Alienation from interaction by this reasoning, however, still summons up secret paradox-selves (according to Goffman's statistical and unverifiable rule). But, while my dramaturgical alienation is a residual inadvertence that can be overcome by better acting, Goffman's alienation is irretrievably locked into equal and opposite outward selflessness generated by the contradiction of an interac? tion reality in the absence of credible selves. Expanding on this point, I would say that, having painted himself into a selfless corner, Goffman is forced to save interaction - which he knows is constituted by selves - by inserting false strategic selves whose credibility for the interactant is existentially empty. He says these selves are the type of most selves in most interactions. But, if Goffman gave up his inner "naked and unsocialized" self and allowed that the consciousness this self must have is the consciousness of the external self not playing itself well enough in the terms of its current interaction ideology, he could get back to a belief that was not empty. His "naked unsocialized" self would then be merely the uneasy self-doubt of the poorly-acted self, and it would be left behind in a truer performance. Goffman's paradox-self simply would not need to be strategic if the presented self, in which it is involved, con? centrated on giving a better performance of what was already in play. The resultant improved credibility would absorb it. If this is so, strategic interaction is both persuasive and malign. In its immorality, however, it has a serious potential to undermine and destroy the interaction order. But this malign kind of potential to undermine interaction may not be typical. It might be the exception case of interaction normally more stable than Goff? man is prepared to admit.</page><page sequence="30">198 It could be thought that I am implying that the effective playing of self is internally unreflective. But that need not be how things are, for it is not a contradiction to posit an interactant who simultaneously performs a highly credible interactive self for others and at the same time inwardly performs a different, equally credible self. Alienation is not now reintroduced, because neither of the two selves needs to feel alienated, neither from itself nor from the other self. This is a twin-self thesis, and there is no reason to stop here. An interactant might fully believe in many simultaneous selves. And, if the several concurrent selves of an interactant do contradict, there still need be no alienation, if that has been swallowed by belief. Alienation in this analysis is a consequence of disbelief, not of incompatibility. There just is no need to be a "merchant of morality" (Goffman, 1971a:243) if, internally, one is credibly moral, however incredible the morality may seem from outside the interaction in post hoc analysis. (Interactions may well be largely about creating real credibility from their production of contradiction that is stimulated by attempts at sincere resolution.) Only if the incompatibility of an interactant's working selves is perceived as such - internally - by yet another interacting self will it engender disbelief and alienation. Then that kind of alienation will take the form of a paradox-self caught in a regress of successive alienations from each realization of the previous one, if it continues to disbelieve, and becoming separate and unalienated from itself - but secret - if it again believes. Fully believing in all possible selves, an interactant might be sublimely contradictory, but will not know this until he or she believes in the contradictions, then precipitating a remainder that either compensates openly and dramaturgically for itself or else gets caught in the foregoing regress with its possible exit of secret coherence. But always the aspiration that keeps consciousness active is towards the one true intangible "future" self that will be referred to in every interaction purely in terms of interac? tion morality. Diversion of belief I have proposed concurrent realities whereby alienation is only possible if one of these realities, by virtue of being poorly performed, seems incapable of becoming more real. Also I have suggested that contradicting selves can be perceptually glossed by their performance. We can still speak of aliena? tion from interaction, however, but not of naked, unsocialized, alienated, inner selves, which now resemble nothing so much as unstable anguish in search of an adequate performer. (But we must remember that current interaction reality will not survive the introduction of new selves that falsify</page><page sequence="31">199 previous selves. New selves that are credible enough to make previous selves incredible destroy the interaction order and start a new interaction.) By this argument, Goffman's alienation is truly selfless, and Goffman's idea of an alienated self a contradiction. (Goffman recognizes this in his careful phrase "naked unsocialized look" and in his analytic exclusion of selves from the essay "Alienation from Interaction.") My alienation of an alienated self, on the other hand, signifies a coherently interactive self in internal and secret opposition to an external false self that it would, if it could, disown, and which, false though it is, compels belief because it is real. This coherently alienated internal self is quite different to any kind of self that could be connected to Goffman's alienation from interaction. So it now seems that an alienated inner self arises to divert belief from an outer self that for whatever reason is experienced as compromising, the depth of the compromise indicating the degree of empty strategic belief therein. When this diversion of belief from an emptying outer form to a fuller inner form happens on a regular basis, the interactant is cut off from other people inside interaction, in clinical terms withdrawn and, in our culture, pathologi? cally so to a degree that invites psychotherapeutic interventions designed to create any combination of (a) belief in the outer false self or (b) a new outer self to believe in or (c) disbelief in the inner self. If we look at Goffman's central conceptual device for the propulsion of his presentation-of-self thesis, this will become clearer. In much of The Presentation of Self in Everday Life, Goffman flounders in the wake of his observations that people are one self onstage and an opposite self back? stage. They must be regulating their respective performances - Goffman uneasily concludes - from a quasi-analytic site of paradoxical alienation. Thus Goffman undercuts his own evidence of considerable belief both in the performances onstage and in those backstage. For example, he (1971a:169) writes: ... in the Shetland Hotel kitchen [where Goffman worked as a washer up] guests would be referred to by belittling code-names; their speech, tone, and mannerisms would be imitated accurately as a source of fun and a means of criticism; their foibles, weaknesses, and social status would be discussed with scholarly and clinical care; their requests for minor services would be met by grotesque facial gestures and cursing, once out of sight and hearing. This equation of abuse was amply balanced by the guests when in their own circles [of which Goffman was a member on arrival in the island], at which time the staff would be described as slothful pigs, as vegetable-like primitive types, as money hungry animals. Yet when speaking directly to one another, staff and guests showed mutual regard and some sweetness of temper. Goffman's own observations here suggest that both front and backstage</page><page sequence="32">200 selves are highly believable, not only to the audiences but to the performers. If they were not so believable they would not strike Goffman as being so remarkably different. Here we can help Goffman out of his bind of having to analytically deny this credibility of opposed selves by invoking my idea of "diversion" of belief. We might say that the frontstage self becomes incredible only after having been all too credible, and then the same amount of belief that had kept it credible diverts to a backstage self which in its turn also becomes too much, occasioning the possibility of belief in the frontstage self the next time it performs. We might say further that the degree of contrast between the two selves allows the same degree of belief that each exhibits and also the degree of belief in both selves that sharpens the contrast to that degree. Were there no upcoming possibility of diversion of belief, it could be too compromising to play either self up to the hilt. And any thinking that is going on is going on in the "mind" of the performance where there certainly can be concurrent belief in temporarily suspended alternative performances. Frontstage is the backstage of the backstage, and the opposed front and backstage selves are culturally not very opposed because all the players know that none should be taken at full face value (in the examples which Goffman selects, and which we enjoy because we know this too, before reading him). Goffman's example of kitchen staff and guests in Shetland Hotel is an example from life where there is no call to be very serious either about eating dinner or serving it. The seriousness is reserved for preventing the ridiculousness of the situation exposing itself. When the opposed parties belittle each other behind each other's back, they belittle a situation which they feel belittles them if they are to take it as fundamentally real. Both parties refer out of the hotel interactions to selves uncompromised by the hotel but, of course, only brought into being by the referring. Alienation in my account, then, cannot coexist with the necessary belief in self that allows the self to become interactionally real. But this is not to say that the playing of false selves may not be a source of much human fellowship, as it is in staged dramas and games. Again, the alienation that might destroy fellowship in the case of a benign false self devolves from poor playing, inept performance, and unconvincing selfhood. It is not inherently a structural fabrication unless the false self - a reversal of Goff? man - is perceived as coherently flouting interaction morality (the "professional foul"), when it will seem malign. So the ease with which interactants may play any number of pretend selves need not mean that human selves have to be alienated entities. If the interactant's self is not credibly a self, regardless of its relation to moral rules, it is failing to command a minimum appreciation both inter? nally and externally, and that is more than mere disturbance of the interac</page><page sequence="33">201 tion order. An undramatized self is just not interactive as a human interac? tant, and only when it is will it be answerable to morality in interaction. I have said that the actor of self responds to his or her inadequacy of self by becoming more of one through greater commitment to dramaturgical competence. This is at once acting better and more conscientiously realiz? ing the rules. Of course, now we could choose to say that the interactant always has to obey the rule of being a self. But that rule is not an interaction rule since obeying it is the precondition of interaction. Anguish The rest of this section extends my account of the self as a dramatic actor in order to lead up to a discussion of insincerity that will permit a reading of Goffman himself as an interactant mistaking incompetence for insincerity. I believe that Goffman's skewed appreciation of incompetence is responsible for his alienation and - in a vicious circle - his alienation thesis. The interactant as a dramatic actor -1 claim - is a player of a self whose belief in that self is not the result of inner calculation but the product of being caught up in and carried away by itself. (Here I am only talking about interaction that has neither malign selves nor a perceived presence of institutional coercion.) Threatened with selflessness, the interactant who is a dramatic actor will not sit back behind the controls of the self, as it were, and set a new course for a new face. Threatened, the actor of self becomes more of the self that is being threatened. If this "becoming more" fails to reduce the threat of selflessness and if the self cannot counter the threat either by invalidating it or by showing that it is off target, anguish will be felt. (Goffman cannot say this. He never stops operating the model of naked puppet-masters inside false selves. In "Radio Talk," as we have seen, he (1981b:325) writes: "And by and large, it seems he [the interactant] selects that footing which provides him the least self-threatening position...." The verb "selects" is analytic and does not mesh with our sense of the rapid, unthinking, completely dramaturgical self-correction that Goffman is talking about. Goffman has a speaker evading threat by instant self-redefini? tion and at the same time Goffman inserts a cognitive operation of selec? tion. I do not believe that "selection" catches the experience we have that speakers may be instantly and audience-responsively striving to maintain credibility by varying and deepening the interactive self so that the threat and its overcoming reinforce the self. Reaction to threat seems to me much more like waking up to what is going on and stepping on the gas to get out of trouble. There is no space for selection except in the analysis later on,</page><page sequence="34">202 where the word selection distorts the actual interactional experience.) Anguish is the predicament of being both fundamentally misunderstood and fundamentally incapable of making one's self understood - either internally or externally - in the form of a nascent self that one believes is true. When misunderstanding is culturized as prejudice (racial, sexual, political, religious, normative), the anguished would-be self also ex? periences humiliation and degradation. It feels victimized. It is likely to burn with a sense of injustice.6 It seethes, it becomes incensed, and its ressentiment presages rage (Lyman, 1981). The anguished non-self might even develop a revolutionary consciousness and seek confirmatory interac? tion with fellow sufferers. Whatever happens, the sense of unjust desacralization is a direct reference to the moral and ritual order of interac? tion, even when it employs the rhetoric of social injustice at abstract levels of political theory. Nowhere else but in interaction can the self of a human being be so seriously hurt. So fear of anguish is social control in second-by second instalments, and understanding anguish as not being of one's own making is the birth of a rebellious self. (Here I refrain, for the moment, from offering another alternative to anguish, that of self-conversion to a self that surrenders to the threat, but this alternative is clearly indicated.) The self wronged in terms of interaction morality can and does ex? perience its treatment as dehumanization, fully exploiting then the discourse of human rights in reconstitutive accounting ("You just don't treat people like that"). The wronged self that has not been considered as the self that it cannot help believing that it wholeheartedly is identifies with a performance wilfully denigrated by reciprocal interactants. And persistent degradation of the sort meted out in cult groups and total institutions is as if designed to destroy presenting selves, focusing the attack precisely on the belief of interactants that their presenting selves are rightfully and representatively theirs. If all routes back to belief in the sacral reality of the degraded self are blocked - as in cults - by self-denunciations employing cult ideology, there really is no other escape but into a new self approvable by the cult. If, however, the denunciations cannot carry away the interactant into a sense of their cogent accuracy, only then can we postulate the strategic presentation of a false self, this time at the behest of a coherent inner self that has been alienated in my sense of that word. But, in this case, strategy is no game playing response but a strategy for survival as a secret self who can only endure so long as it can continue to believe that its secret form is more credible than any available conversions of itself. That secret form is a coherent alienated self to be strongly contrasted with Goffman's routine alienated selflessness which, often enough, he too forgets (in Stigma and Asylums especially). Here Bettelheim (1970) describes the coherent</page><page sequence="35">203 alienated self and its de-compromising function: Inside the camps I did not study my behaviour, nor did I study my fellow prisoners or question them because I intended to make a disinterested survey of a problem that had aroused my scientific interest. Quite the contrary; not detached curiosity, but vital self interest induced me to study my own behaviour and the behaviour I noticed around me. To observe and try to make sense out of what I saw was a device that spontaneously suggested to itself to me as a way of convincing myself that my own life was still of some value, that I had not yet lost all the interests that had once given me self respect. This, in turn, helped me to endure life in the camps, (p. 105) Those prisoners who blocked out neither heart nor reason, neither feelings nor perception, but kept informed of their inner attitudes even when they could hardly ever afford to act on them, these prisoners survived and came to understand the conditions they lived under. They also came to realize what they had not perceived before; that they still retained the last, if not the greatest, of the human freedoms: to choose their own attitude in any given circumstance. Prisoners who understood this fully, came to know that this, and only this, formed the crucial difference between retaining one's humanity (and often life itself) and accepting death as a human being.... (p. 147) Selves at issue with themselves The self of the interactant as a dramatic actor is the dramatic actor variously believing in himself or herself. However, it can only be the product of prior interactions. It will have been well rehearsed by rearing, education, training, membershipping, and concurrent socialization, as well as, in some cases, by professionalization, and we know that in self-transformation cults all prior selves can be reversed. Cults create new selves out of the destruction of old ones. That is their attraction. But self-destruction and renovation would be impossible without the self's belief in itself as the self of an interactant. Take away that belief, and there is no self, or, if there is, it is the paradox of Goffman's alienated self. The self who presents for conversion is, so to speak, already converted somewhere else. St Paul may have been Saul but before he was Saul he was someone else again, and the road to Damascus is a road, not just one moment of blinding light. So perhaps, after all, our society is a society of selves that are false because they are convertible (but, contra Goffman, most of them command? ing inner and outer belief)? So perhaps insincerity, as Goffman hints, is the statistical rule, but only so, effectively, because it is sincere? So perhaps a correct definition of self now is that it is always false, because it can always be made false!</page><page sequence="36">204 If we are saying yes in answer to these questions, the self is most false precisely when it can believe that it is true in the face of interaction's capacity to convert it, and only the unconvertible self is true. But the unconvertible self is only externally interactive if it can convert all other reciprocal selves in all possible conditions to its own reality, after the manner of prophets, one of whom Goffman almost is (Creelan, 1984), and thus the unconvertible self is not a self, because in principle it closes itself off from the credibility of reciprocal selves. Interactionally posthumous, all its capacity to learn is focused on its not being interactive, which for others it will still have to be. This renunciation of other people is the frivolous existentialism of gurus, who claim the renunciation as the enlightenment that others should aspire to. But what of the unconvertible self that finds no other believers but itself? I do not think that it is human in our understand? ing. The seriousness with which it takes itself is comically irrelevant, crank? like and featherbrained, but often - as a response to such attribution - inspired by megalomaniacal impulses that, if they could become socially real, as in terrorism or suicide threat, would force us to take it seriously then. In the foregoing discussion of selves as dramatic actors, I have argued "the actor of self from his or her inside, as it were. This could nudge the reader to a view that interactions are full of competing performers. That view is not, however, compatible with the interactionist idea that actors are success? ful so far as they are responsive to others who are collectively the audience of one another. Interactional order, creating and created by selves, is as much in the audience's control as it is in the control of the current per? former. (For instance, we can see from the treatment of bores how actors are kept within the bounds of their achieved and perceived capacity to hold our interest.) Interaction construed in terms of actors taking turns as audience naturally favours its theoretical perception as the site for the human emotions of being stirred, moved, or transported, before it is anything else. (And it does seem that few of us positively relish such utopias as Habermas' communicative rationality, perhaps because we live in realities that do not share his consciousness of Hitler's generation of Germans.)7 VIH. Switching out the Goffmanian strategist: Perceiving insincerity Some theorists of interaction say that sincerity is impossible to establish, and leave it at that (Luhmann, 1987:122; Maturana, 1988:54, 61). But if one</page><page sequence="37">205 thinks ritually one cannot fail to see that enormous social effort is put into trying to seem "impossibly" sincere, usually, I would say, because interac? tants really are sincere. That a lot of the effort is successful begs the international question of how success is done. Belief obviously is the key, not so much induced by strategic ap? pearances, I have suggested, but by ritual power. Ritually, belief should be the kind of belief we have that this actor plays that part more believably or less believably than another actor. The gifted invocation of corpora, I suggest, persuades us of an interactant's reality, and this must have far more to do with dramaturgical accomplishment (of the strategic appearance) than with the relevant strategy, if there is one. Belief in the dramatic reality of interactants, I have argued, may even carry us to the point of glossing patent contradictions of strategic presentations, if they are strategic. So we may feel that in the extreme case of contradictory presentations our scepticism in interaction follows our inclination to be enthusiastically swayed by compell? ing performance. And this suggests that dramatic persuasion which is not readily falsified may be the type of our belief in sincerity, beyond considera? tions of rigorously epistemological plausibility. Indeed, it is the suscep? tibility to such belief that has appalled many philosophers, notably Kant, whose "straight serve" belief in universal reason one could lob back over his head if his persuasion to it were dramaturgical: "Reason moves us only through the emotions that arise in us in the course of our conversations (or reflections) within the braided flow of our languaging and our emotioning" (Maturana, 1988:50). I suspect that - along this line of thought - the vernacular feeling that highly plausible but insincere selves must have exceedingly pernicious anti? social intent is but the mirror of everyday sincerity accrued through ritual power. (We should note here that the argument for the performative nature of sincerity is not in conflict with Goffman's strategic model. A trusting or credulous willingness to believe is also strategically functional [Goffman, 1969:63-69; Luhmann, 1979].) Sincerity as we actually see it, then, is a function of our persuasion to it, and insincerity can only be perceived in dissuasion and alienation. Could we detect insincerity in persuasive performance? I think not, because the moment that insincerity is detected persuasion fails. Put the other way round, insincerity is undetectable except as a consequence of poor perfor? mance, but only if the performance is perceived as poor. If performance is poor, however, must we say that it is also strategically insincere? Can we not say that it is merely incompetent? I doubt that we can postulate alienated inner selves (whether Goffman's paradox-selves or my coherently alienated ones) as necessary concomitants of performed selves unless all selves appear to us as insincere. And it seems</page><page sequence="38">206 to me that one has to think of situations like concentration camps before one can concede the necessity for coherently alienated inner selves. But only if all selves appear to us as insincere can we equate poor performance with the exposure of strategic manipulations of appearances, though strategic manipulations are more likely to be both consummately performed and completely closed to disbelief, the one because of the other. Goffman is inclined to depict interaction as a mutual paranoia in which the hazards of immaculate performance are such that everybody concerned must be strategists of a "cold war." He is dissuaded from sincerity and belief because as a detached observer he cannot share it. Goffman sees interactants not doing justice to themselves and, at the same time as diagnosing selfless alienation from interaction, he paradoxically accuses interactants of having other juster selves that could make his cold war hot. (In his dissertation Goffman acquires his sense of these other selves from the interactants observed in different interactions. Contradictions across interactions argue for Goffman, within an interaction, contradictions that I would say are sufficiently glossed for all the interactants save Goffman, cursed with his excellent fieldworker memory.) It would be more reasonable for Goffman to believe instead that, typi? cally, people are not so highly skilled as professional actors at coming across as people. Frankly, Goffman cannot be certain that interactants could feel certain that they are people who insincerely feel that they should be responded to as such. It is only Goffman in Shetland, where his sociology is conceived in toto, who doubts that interactants are as selved and human as they expect to be treated, and it is from the vantage of his analytic doubt that Goffman arraigns interactants for strategic insincerity. He seems not to have interpreted his disappointment with most human presentations as a reflection on his understandable drama-critic dissatisfaction with the persuasiveness of the relevant portrayals. My view is that the root of Goffman's dissatisfaction with everyday performance is his desire to write formal sociology, which then alienates him from interaction. But formal sociology too is only another interaction reality, preferred by Goffman - it might be - not because it can be logically more sincere than the realities it analyses but because it seems more real and of greater ritual power. Goffman in this light is engaged in a truth war. He (1953:2) pledges a stronger truth for his analysis when logically he may only refer to an analytic reality that happens to make his sociologist self feel more real in the interactions he covertly involves himself in as their "observant participant," who is of course the alienated (and successful) strategist staring at his reflection in every other person. I shall now enlarge on the "effort of trying to be impossibly sincere," thereby launching the concept of "hyper-involvement," before commenting</page><page sequence="39">207 further on Goffman's reading insincerity into incompetence. Hyper-involve? ment and sincerity then recede behind Section X's argument that the self prior to an interaction is not the self that is being converted but the interac? tional fuel for conversion. Following that argument, I stay with the interac? tants, who are poised for conversion, right up to their conversion. IX. Switching out the Goffmanian strategist: Hyper-involvement By formulating a rule of detachment Goffman blocks the possibility that interactants can become more persuasively real. Detachment for Goffman is typically the brake on involvement that prevents interactants from destroy? ing their interactions by over-enthusiasm. Distrusting the thought of an involvement that could heighten itself and still not offend the interaction, Goffman errs toward the belief - most clearly stated in Behavior in Public Places - that increased involvement on behalf of enhanced persuasiveness must be self-defeating. Avoidance of destructive over-involvement is not - in my dramatic accounting - achieved by disbelief - and this is a pivotal revision of Goff? man - but through fluid and sensitive accommodation to the interaction wherein the actor tries to perform better by avoiding the incompetence of overacting. Not destructively overacting means constructively acting more truthfully and more involvingly by ever more sensitively-escalating rituality (Grotowski, 1976; Cless, 1979; Brook, 1980), while not over-involving in the Goffmanian sense breeds alienative inner detachment. Thus a switch of rhetoric switches out the alienated strategist. I am definitely not saying that there can be no secret and alienated strategist. Of course there can, as I have indicated in the case of Bruno Bettelheim, who psychologically survives a concentration camp by applying a desperate internal discipline of detached observation that sustains his prior, scientific, psychoanalyst self in the face of dehumanizing degradations. The point is, internal discipline on this order reflects horren? dous sociality; otherwise it is either unnecessary or - I am not sure about this - must construct sociality as horrendous (Marx, Weber, Simmel, Adorno, Sartre, Foucault, Baudrillard), possibly from moods of depression and frozen rage (Levin, 1984). One barrier to accepting the idea that one is not always someone else beside one's performed self is the feeling - many stage actors are puzzled by it - that one has to be out of role - as another self - to play the staged role. The stage self seems to have to be split. But I would claim, to the contrary, that the role plays the role and that it is the role that knows best how to play itself. The role is the dramaturgically conscious actor incor</page><page sequence="40">208 porating as much as it can of the actor's psychobiology so as to play itself in forgetfulness of the actor it has been. Acting better, in the felt deficiency of poor performance that precipitates an uneasy self-critical virtual self, will mean creating, therefore, a more involving focus, both of the interactant and of reciprocal selves. This is to be compared with the Goffman (1975:350) desideratum of detaching internally in order not to "flood out" and break up the interaction, which desideratum entails not really living the interaction in the way I say interactants as actors of themselves do live it much more often than - in Goffman - they do not. One only has to think of tight Weberian bureaucracies in this connection. Officials nowadays facilitate communication the less they play themselves as faceless officialdom and the more they perform their work as self-realization along the lines bureaucracies very often provide through compulsory in-house encounter type training. Of course, at the end of an interaction you might not like the focus, even though it will have been inalienably yours: Its [conversation's] progress, more rapid than my ideas, forcing me almost always to speak before thinking, has often suggested to me stupidities and ineptitudes that my reason disapproved and my heart disavowed at the moment they escaped from my mouth, but which, preceding my own judgement, could not be reformed by its censure. (Rousseau, quoted in Blonsky, 1985) A very good example of the "you are always someone else" thesis is provided by Miller (1986:181): Absent from Goffman's account of self-production, strange to say, is the recognition that social performers, like stage actors, act and control their conduct from a standpoint outside their immediate roles. It is precisely this relation of the actor to his part that Goffman overlooks. For this reason it may be said that he fails to extend the dramaturgical analogy far enough, since any viable theory of stage acting must give an account of this relationship. ... Goffman wants to claim that social selves are presented or produced but deny that the performer plays a causal role in the production. Weirdly, Miller is on target but only to shoot it down instead of pass through it. He cannot see the real value of Goffman, which is the lodgement of social life in visible performance rather than in invisible causal agents. Miller would have Goffman relinquish the seen for the unseen, and accord priority to an inner referent of self as though that is a perfectly socialized homuncule or primal causative agent that precedes the experience which makes what sense of it that there can be. We have had a great many such</page><page sequence="41">209 responses to Goffman. Goffman opens a door and the likes of Miller choose not to pass through it but to shut it in their own faces. (The reader of this paper ought to be in no doubt that I have gone through Goffman's door and shut it firmly behind me, locking out, thereby, the anguish that would blame itself for the social conditions generating it. Goffman, of course, lives at both sides of the door, at my side as performance, and through its Judas hole as a strategist.) I think that the difficulty to which Miller responds with his proposal of a controlling inner self arises in the very possibility that interactants may have concurrent internal and external selves. Now, while Miller would want to say that any other self than the one that is externally performed must somehow operate the external performance, I am saying that all concurrent selves are credible and that each one is operated by itself. For example, if I am a good pedestrian who does not bump into other people as I walk down the street while I talk (as a good conversationalist) to a companion, I am not operating the pedestrian from the conversationalist nor the conversationalist from the pedestrian. I might even be privately thinking that I would prefer to be somewhere else doing something else, but the "me" who thinks that only gets into the conversation and the walking if the conversationalist and the pedestrian let it. And, if the walking and the conversation become more engrossing, there is every chance of the "me" who would like to be else? where simply vanishing. Similarly, if the walking becomes engrossing, the conversationalist might falter, and if the conversationalist becomes very caught up in himself, the pedestrian might go awry. Certainly all these selves - conversationalist, pedestrian, alienated self - draw on my memory. But my memory is not another controlling self since it is the self that does the remembering. My performances are the selves that everybody is talking about. There can be no other selves, but as I have said it is in vain to assume they can have final formulation, because they are completely interactive as referen? tial and indispensable moral foci that are intrinsically provisional. However, it is the very indispensability of selves that is responsible for their register? ing as primal agents in modernistic regressions such as Miller's (only in their force are selves primal agents, not located inside people's heads but in interaction). Selves can only be inferred projectively from pure appearances that are, strictly, guidance coordinates for selves-in-progress (whose progress sustains the relevant coordinates and not vice versa). For Goffman, the principal guidance coordinate is the ritual frame. He is not coming from it but moving towards it in successive realizations. Living the interaction, on the stage and in everyday life, would involve good truthful acting achieved in full reference to current interaction morality through a clairvoyant awareness of the self. Of such awareness, the</page><page sequence="42">210 classical actor John Gielgud says: "[T]he mind [is] clearly divided between the imaginative impulse and the deliberate evocation of the part, with nothing allowed to distract from these two processes, which should be complementary - the one feeding and sustaining the other" (Funke and Booth, 1961). Feedback escalation of this sort is the opposite of Goffman's unruly and disruptive over-involvement. Accordingly, I would put beside Goffman's reined detachment from involvement a "hyper-involvement" both with and in the process of involvement. And this is not to speak of a being behind seeming, but of the human condition for seeming to be. Perhaps Goffman's problem with belief derives from his early Shetland association with actors who just did not seem credible to him. The crofters and the gentry of Baltasound in the island of Unst did not and could not take Goffman in, and so he analysed them as if they did not take one another in, while nevertheless protecting their identities under pseudonyms lest his work would offensively draw to their attention that of which they really were unaware. Four years after Shetland, Goffman spends another fieldwork year in another world, the mental hospital in Washington. Here, again, he cannot believe that those whom the staff designate mad are existentially mad. Inmates, Goffman declares, are inmates because they conform to the ritual idiom in unacceptable ways, and they do not hood? wink their covert sociological observer with their performed madness. Yes, Goffman might be right, but some mad people might not feel their vic timage solely in terms of situational impropriety. Their anguish might even be socially incurable, untouched by brainwashing institutionalization or by any humane alternative in the world that made them sick. Suppose Goffman had studied those whose knowledge of the ritual idiom and whose competence to enact moral desiderata were both exceptional and dedicated to persuasion? Suppose he had studied - in their daily rounds of social reform - intelligently committed persons of conscience, like Simmel and Weber, but in the flesh, or like Ghandi or like Melanie Klein? Then, might he have believed in them? Then, might he have balanced his analysis with the idea that ritual being is a quality commanding belief through more than strategic reference to rules of interaction morality? And, if Goffman had been persuaded by the enacted propriety of persons of conscience, would he have been able to go on sociologizing them, or would he have joined them in their struggles? We shall never know. Though we do know that the finest passages of Goffman's oeuvre (Asylums, Stigma) fervently condemn those who stand for ritual propriety on behalf of an unjust status quo. This must be why Goffman is serious, why his analysis persuades.</page><page sequence="43">211 X.The self as an interactional conversion syndrome: The fate of prior selves Let us now recall the presenting selves of an interaction. These selves have come from the production order of another interaction and even in the periods between interactions may have had a sense of ritual continuity given by internal interaction (reflection) of various credible internal selves together with the psychobiological memory of previous interactions. Prior to their new selvings, though, the presenting selves will have been other selves - even if now being experienced as similar - because each interac? tion generates its local selves, drawing on the interactants' shared corpora that will also be drawing on each interactant's ritual feeling of continuing selfhood. It will be because interactions are not very highly involving that con? tinuity of self can be experienced, and everyday interactions may be less involving than they could be just so as to maintain for interactants the continuities of their selves. But analytically we do have new selves in new interactions, even if they experience themselves as more or less faithfully recreating old ones. So what happens to the prior selves that precede each interaction? I am going to argue, in this section, that their effective revoca? tion fuels the new selves. Clearly, revocation will only be experienced as total conversion when the new self that is produced is significantly more real than the old one. But, equally clearly, even the production of a very nearly identical new self is achieved by the same revocation process, only this time, vis-?-vis prior self, assertively and regeneratively rather than destructively. In either case, however, prior self is up for revision. If it were not, interactions could have no moment for interactants, and interactants would not feel that they have the powerful identity-commitment that they do have when interacting. It should be borne in mind that the converted self of this paper will not be a self who is converted but in every case a self wholly constituted by a conversion process. This is a reminder that I am not talking about selves except as interactional selves. The interaction-proof self to all my current intents and purposes does not exist. Katz's (1972) argument that the recognition of deviant act or of extraor? dinarily superior performance jumps the perceived actor to a transcendent ontological position can supply my sense here that actors do bring off experiential foci that are redefinitive of self with reference to a background prior self held ritually by the interactant. And Katz's (1975) further argu? ment that performance is always a reference - on behalf of interaction reality - as-if-out-of-the-interaction gives us an idea both of how interac? tional charisma is beyond rules and of how it is done in terms of interac</page><page sequence="44">212 tional responsiveness. Warren (1980) notes that those possessing negative ritual power (deviants) may have a special learned aptitude and strong motive for employing that power in a switch to positive ritual power (charisma), often in ostensive interactional relation to shared knowledge of prior "continuous" selves. But, while Katz and Warren - not quite detached enough from the cultural doggedness of prior selves - ascribe transinterac tional ontological reality to the selves they postulate, I see the same sort of selves simply as indispensable interactional references only brought into being during interaction, and thus more alive. Not quite fully sociological, Katz and Warren subscribe to their own conclusions with insufficient reflexivity of the kind I shall soon display. Under pain of self-consistency The order of the ritual interactional system relies on the consistency of its constitutive selves. Though interactants might be pouring their energy into negotiating satisfactorily redefined selves, they do not precipitously re-selve because, definitionally, that would start a new interaction. Further, an interactant must avoid re-selving, since interaction would be deritualized by an interactant who could meaningfully dodge all moral responsibility. A re selved interactant would be seen to possess two unrelated rather than complementary selves, and reciprocal interactants interacting with one self of the two selves would then invalidate the other. Invalidation such as this, of a current interaction self, is both offensive and the punishment of offence, in either case instantly initiating the remedial work that constitutes meaningful interaction. Goffman's treatment of embarrassment in Interaction Ritual focuses on this issue, but the difference there is that Goff? man's "second self occasions embarrassment because it invalidates the first one as a self. My second self of the re-selving interactant could live unembarrassedly with the first one but is deconstitutive of the interaction on account of being unrelated. Here embarrassment, if it occurs, would not be of the dual interactant first, but of the reciprocal interactants unable to focus the interactant as single. This is our cultural rule. It cannot be argued from the analytic point of view of interaction as a sui generis order. (To be sure, in our culture, persons may mimic and impersonate other selves, but they cannot do so unless unequivocally framed as mimics and impersonators, for without such framing no one knows where they are or what is going on. They are inside Goffman's "negative experience." Probably we never see dual selves as unrelated because we are culturally persuaded by their single psychobiological presence that they must be one.) So the self of interaction looks for consistency, and consistency with its</page><page sequence="45">213 selves in other interactions will have to be subordinate to consistency within a given interaction. That it is easy to be other than one has been when one is a stranger or newcomer to a scene should alert us to the self's performative nature that does lead an interactant to believe in his or her self even if this is a deliberate misrepresentation. And interactional threat to false self may well be felt as keenly as threats to a true one (Goffman, 1968). More commonly, interactants who are attributed selves that are strangers' mis construals can feel that, however bizarre the strangers' misconstruals, the misconstruals are distressingly true just because the strangers believe them. The prior self as the suspect guilty until proven innocent Beyond the misconstrual of selves and the uncompletable remedial work of correcting false impressions, no misconstrual will ever be laid to rest. That an interactant could have supported the misconstrual is enough evidence for others that the interactant could revert to the misconstrued self. Suspicion, like mud, sticks, and the cultural knowledge that suspicion sticks is a powerful impetus upon interactants not to arouse it. In cults it is the prior self who is the suspect. Re-emergence of prior self will be both the reason for its exorcism and the reason why the cult ceaselessly observes its rites and repeats its ideology. Naturally, rites will be in proportion to the degree of transformation of self. In everyday interaction a constitutive rite will be the continuous revoca? tion of prior selves, unless the ongoing culture, like an ideal military cadre, is frozen, never involving anyone in more than their endlessly iterated first impressions of one another. The revocation of prior selves, however, need not, as I have said, take the aggressive form of declarative exorcism. Instead, prior selves are usually built on, and, to the degree that interactions go beyond first impressions, prior selves supersede themselves under a whole range of rubrics, such as personal growth, maturation, making friends, self-realization, and socialization. Supersession of prior self, with some "status passages" (Glaser and Strauss, 1971), is the way of prior self's practical though positively-toned euthanasia, even when the everyday interactions are routinely degrading, as in prisons where the transformation rubric - to save the faces of those resonsible for the degradations - may be masked by the "humane" rhetoric of rehabilitation.8 Prior selves are whom an interaction cannot control and whom the interactants can revert to. That is why, as the continuous threat of de stabilization, they are the suspects of an interaction. But, if they are univer? sally treated as guilty, the threat is weakened and there need be no digres? sive trial or kangaroo court.</page><page sequence="46">214 Confessing the prior self Cushman's analogy clarifies the uncompromising logic of finding the suspect prior self guilty. Through their continuing involvement in current indoctrination reality, recruits in Cushman's model learn to see that the selves they had prior to the interaction are foolish and invalid and destruc? tive. Those prior selves are like that because, were they to re-emerge, they would offensively cast doubt on the current reality of conversion, through the ideology has it that even without the ideology the prior selves are thoroughly bad. Yet, in the Cushman conversion interaction, prior selves are never forgotten. Past doings of the recruits are indefatigably construed as faulty, to be confessed and denounced. That is the main work of indoctrination, culminating in conversion and final repudiation of prior self in the name of a reborn self. The homicidal reification of prior self as a grave ontological error is the means by which it is dissociated from meaningful future reality. But there is only a future reality because the prior self is constantly remem? bered as needing that in an approved ideological form. Thus the constant reference to prior self has the additional function of preserving - while severing it - the continuity of prior self without which (the experience of continuity) the new self could decide that current goings on are so strange that, like a dream or nightmare, they do not involve "whom" the interactant thinks he or she really is. Can we say that interactants indoctrinate one another, that they tirelessly treat those prior selves who do not fit the current interaction reality as offensive? The Goffmanian answer is yes. For any self emerging only in the terms of prior realities, on account of being uninfluenced by current reality, is not alive to the ongoing interaction. The unregenerate prior self making itself current will have to offend, and will be called upon to repair the offence instantly by revoking itself. Revocation then enacts itself in apologies and excuses and all the other varieties of self-blame, the blame here attaching to a current self owning up to having been too dissociated from what has been going on. The exception, again, is the malign false self that does not apologize when it embodies institutional terror. This is the Social Security clerk, for example, who by monotonously repeating a legal rule treats a client like dirt and then responds to the responsive anger with: "If there's any more ofthat, I'll call the police [or psychiatrist]." If we think about what a prior self would have to be, we will see that its reappearance in an interaction must be offensive. No matter the exchanges that have taken place, no matter the stories told, no matter the opinions aired, no matter the jokes cracked, no matter the views expressed, a prior self would be prior for acknowledging none of these. It would behave as</page><page sequence="47">215 though the current interaction had not happened, since if the prior self displayed any cognizance of current interaction it could not be described as a prior self. We can imagine the effect such a self would have on interac? tants should it suddenly emerge unkeyed by a remedial frame. It would be treated with incredulity, and forced to produce an acceptable account for its perfect disattention. The outrage against an interactant who would regard what is going on as nothing should tell us that what is going on is every? thing. Thus, when the tiniest lapses of concentration are betrayed, apologies ensue. They might even be phrased with such locutions as "I was miles away" or "I'm sorry, I'm not myself today," the "myself here ironically being other than the prior self it seems to refer to: After all, the very efficacy of an apology is due to its capacity to con? vince us that the person making it is a somewhat different person from the one who committed the offense in the first place... (Goffman, 1981b:320) The converting self denounces the prior self But however much we cling to the analytic view that selves are interaction dependent, we find it hard to stick to that view in discussing them. Again and again - unable to see it simply as an indispensable interactional moral reference - we re-import a vernacular self that seems to survive from interaction to interaction as if immune to the perils of interaction. I am not here taking the view that analyses could not be created in which such a self could have meaning. My position is more sophisticated than that, and completely reflexive. It would advise that in the current interaction system between this text and the reader there is no warrant for suddenly introduc? ing a theoretically interaction-proof self. That would over-activate a prior self, with a vengeance. (Perhaps really this text is nothing but manic defence work to evade the guilt of destroying a beloved inner object, as Melanie Klein might say?) This text considered as the order of an interac? tion, however, defines a particular reality, where selves are interaction dependent, and strenuously it sustains its reality, meeting anticipated objections with remedial work that toughens this reality. To stay meaning? ful the text works at constituting readers as other than prior selves. The reader is continuously being cast in the role of one to whom prior selves might have been theoretically interaction-proof, but to whom they cannot seem like that any more. I exorcize antithetical prior selves - those of theories, those of readers - as a way of instating converted ones. That is as far as my text's relevance would go, just so far as its boundaries, in a strictly Goffmanian account read</page><page sequence="48">216 strictly by Manning (1988; 1989a). But, if the text is regarded not as a frame but as a "ritual realm" (Travers, 1987), its rituality will escape the text in the manner of all charismatic formulations, only to be supervened by competing rituality, not by argument per se, unless the argument, perhaps through being a better one, is more ritually persuasive. This paper, then, is a species of indoctrination, a little cult with its own divine authority (Goffman). Like cult groups, like any interaction, it seeks converts. It must seek converts. It must aggressively deconstruct any self that does not believe that self is interaction-dependent, doing this to the limit of its competence to do so by discrediting the prior self that might not have believed in this text's revised Goffman. At the same time, however, the text keeps having to remember prior selves and prior-self type theoriza tion in order to distinguish its own selves as improved conversions. But, though the converted self of this paper must be wholly interaction-depend? ent, it is, like Goffman's presented self, something else as well. The converted self here is the running conversion of prior self, where Goffman's presented self is merely his attempt to somehow perpetuate prior self in the crypt of alienation. It looks as if I have undercut my earlier (Section IV) assertion that an interactant has one self that he or she cannot disown, who would be a self securely stood on ultimate moral ground. This self, I have implied, will fight to the death to preserve its integrity, the death being of the psychobiol ogy or of the integrity, whichever is the sooner. Is this not a prior self? I do not think so. Rather I conceive it as a self, within an interaction, succeeding in closely approaching its ultimate moral reference. It is not a resurrection of a buried self but a steadfast articulation of an available current self whose reality is threatened by current alienation. Certainly, the emergence of such a self seems as if it must be the disclosure of a real self, but in this analysis it is the spontaneous creation of a seriously alternative new self. Should it choose to account itself by reference to any number or prior selves in a process of positive revocation (or constructive self-realization) it performs "conversion accounting" on behalf of the accountor now. This should not come as a surprise. The final moral self - in our culture - is the one you only discover when push (of social falsification) comes to shove (of adamant social falsification). It cannot be guaranteed in advance, I suggest, but after it has died for its cause it will be seen as having been the apotheosis of the dead interactant. Its tragic drama is dramatic because while it is going on no amount of reference to prior self will foretell the outcome, and it is tragic because the self it delivers is only that self too late to avoid the drama.</page><page sequence="49">217 XI. The self as an interactional conversion syndrome: Alienation Cushman says that during indoctrination the foolish, invalid, and dangerous prior self serves - from the point of view of the recruit - as the argument for the recruit's self-saving recruitment into the new interaction. The current indoctrination reality promises new solutions to old problems, seen as problems so as to justify the current conversion reality. The logic is, if you are here it is because you must want to be, even if you do not know that, even if you thought you were unproblematic elsewhere, even if at present you do not quite see how you might be fully converted to this new reality that "we know" is better than the old one. Stripped of all supportive reference save that of the relevant cult corpora, Cushman's recruits experience dissociation, anxiety, panic, mania, euphoria, depression, and rage. (Clearly this is interaction in extremis.) Desperate to stabilize themselves, recruits are reduced to only two choices: try to refute present reality or try to believe in it. Hanging between the options of outright refutation ("what is going on here is unreal") and belief ("what is going on here is more real than any prior goings on that I have experienced") is intolerable, much worse than Goffman's routine alienation. Garfinkel (1967:47-48), quoting reports of experimentally "breached" families (i.e. families whose definition of reality has been systematically undermined), describes the relevant emotions: ... family members were stupefied. They vigorously sought to make the strange actions intelligible and to restore the situation to normal ap? pearances. Reports were filled with accounts of astonishment, bewilder? ment, shock, anxiety, embarrassment, and anger, and with charges by various family members that the student [the breacher] was mean, inconsiderate, selfish, nasty, or impolite. Family members demanded explanations; What's the matter? What's gotten into you? Did you get fired? Are you sick? What are you being so superior about? Why are you mad? Are you out of your mind or are you just stupid? One student acutely embarrassed his mother in front of her friends by asking if she minded if he had a snack from the refrigerator. "Mind if you have a little snack? You've been eating little snacks around here for years without asking me. What's gotten into you?" One mother, infuriated when her daughter spoke to her only when she was spoken to, began to shriek angry denunciation of the daughter for her disrespect and insubordination and refused to be calmed by the student's sister. A father berated his daughter for being insufficiently concerned for the welfare of others and of acting like a spoiled child. Occasionally family members would first treat the student's action as a cue for a joint comedy routine which was soon replaced by irritation and exasperated anger at the student for not knowing when enough was enough. Family members mocked the "politeness" of the students - "Certainly Mr. Hertzberg!" - or charged the student with acting like a</page><page sequence="50">218 wise guy and generally reproved the "politeness" with sarcasm. These are the emotions when reality is redefined without warning and by family members normally expected to abide by parental definitions of proper behaviour. But if the redefinition is "official," and if those responsible for the redefinition are respected in precisely their capacity to so redefine it, and if the redefined interactants trust the new reality and its promise of radical, beneficial self-transformation, and if the inter? actants undergoing redefinition nonetheless feel that they cannot yet trans? form themselves, we might expect their emotions, privately, to be more violent versions of family members' emotions in Garfinkel's experiments, with the extra twist of self-hate. In cults, however, such emotions will not be treated as responses to the organized breaching of background expec? tancies but as the agonized and "natural" birth of new authentically real selves, at last. Garfinkel restricts the possibility of breaching to his own experiments. Goffman (1975:Chs. 9, 12), on the other hand, would detect possible breaching in most interactions. I would say, analytically, that all interac? tions proceed in the threatened breach of initial selvings, and that the emotional background of this, a severe test of sanity itself, is the potent motivator one would be looking for not only (a) to account for the ever readiness of interaction to self-constitutively correct for infractions but also (b) to explain the conversion of interactants. (Breaching here is a stronger version of Goffman's alienation from interaction. It is missing from Garfinkel's "routine grounds" because within those grounds selves are converts rather than presentations. When we look at the effects of breach? ing, we can see why it is easier to be a convert than a presentation, and we can also see why Goffman feels that the "sleep" of everyday false conscious? ness is "very deep.") XII. The self as an interactional conversion syndrome: No exit What stops the recruit, plunged into emotional turmoil, from exiting the interaction? Exit is possible only if the recruit still has a powerful enough self to make the exit in accordance with his or her view that current interaction reality is unreal in an intensely existential sense. But, at this precise moment when such a powerful prior self is needed, the interactant must find that it is not so powerful as it was prior to the interaction just because, during the current indoctrination, it has been weakened. Exit depends on what the interactant cannot any longer produce, a self that has not yet got to this point of disintegrative choice. The self capable of exit is the prior self</page><page sequence="51">219 that the recruit arrived with, and it is not this self any more. Thus the belief option is more open than the exit option. But some recruits succeed in exiting cult groups, and some interactants do manage to leave interactions that they experience as both unreal and an abuse of their prior selves. These exiting interactants will always be damned by those they leave behind, who stigmatize defectors as unfit for the benefits offered or sadly incapable of making the requisite changes of self. There can be no case where exiting interactants are applauded for departing to better realities, for that would leave the remaining interactants admitting that the current interaction reality is less involving than it could be. The kind of exit I have in mind is a deliberate exercise in self-removal. Again, this seems to imply an interaction-independent self powerful enough never to be taken in by any interaction reality. Two observations will correct that impression. The powerful exiting self will be powerful in terms of other interactions. Only from ritual experience elsewhere will it know itself to be suffering desacralization here. Moreover, the exit will not be like quiet absenteeism. Walking out on a flourishing interaction without the offer of remedial excuse and apology will occasion feelings of guilt and shame. (And any tension-reducing offer of excuse and apology may be seized on as material for continuing the captivity of the exiting interactant.) The exiting self will know that, so far as the interaction just left is con? cerned, he or she is strange, and this will not be a comfortable experience, only becoming less uncomfortable the further from the interaction the exiting self goes. The strength to exit, moreover, is a ritual strength. It draws from the memory of having been someone more real elsewhere, whom one might resume being, but not, I would claim, without a feeling of having suffered some loss of self to the desacralizing interaction. From this angle too we have another motive for interaction. Selves desacralized in one interaction can only be resacralized in another interaction. That, probably, is the deepest motive for cult groups or for the human practice of intimate relationships, and a reason why, when cults break up or intimate relation? ships founder, their relevant selves may go to pieces. So now we have recruits who, because their prior, ritually-constituted selves have been weakened, have not exited. How do they cope with their intolerable disbelief in an irrefutable and intolerant current reality, bearing in mind that - in Sections V and VI - this is not the fixed mood that an interaction cannot depart from? In order to sustain a credible self, the Cushman recruit has to go a little way along with belief. The recruit accesses ideological frame analysis, by which I mean the known consensual interaction morality that provides a self-evaluative questionnaire, so to speak, locking into present experience and fusing the recruit more closely yet with his or her ongoing intolerance</page><page sequence="52">220 of interaction reality. At the same time, other interactants provide the possibility of group acceptance just by being there, even if they too are all in a state of reality intolerance. This is the group acceptance that in Cush? man's model is proposed to recruits as unconditional love. Yet the uncondi? tional love which rescues Cushman's recruits from the impossible pos? sibility of exit is doled out on a reward/punishment plan, since - in interac? tion terms - too much acceptance in the form of over-involvement and overacting upstages the acceptors, bids for more than its earned novice share of expert ideological reality. So, here again, the condition of uncon ditionality to which interactions can lead is tightly conditional of selves to be hyper- rather than over-involved. Teetering on the brink of conversion in an exacerbated "selfless" Goff? manian alienation, the interactant cannot but begin to persuade himself or herself that conversion is the only way to stay human, according to a logic set forth in the next-but-one section. There we shall see that, while Goff? man's alienated interactions are like interactions whose ice does not break without shattering the interactants, my interactions, once their ice is broken by conversion, may be warm without having to be hot and war-like. XQI. Goffman's neglect of euphoria In this section I leave interactants stranded in their alienated condition of not being able to believe in current interaction reality. These interactants, like Goffman's, are alienated from interaction but with the differences (a) that their alienation is not seen as the typical consummation of interaction and (b) that it is experienced as intolerable and inescapable. Because Goff? man (1953:243-246) is steeped in alienation as a result of having a pessimis? tic view of interactional euphoria, we ought now to look at euphoria as exit in the direction of conversion. Goffman not only thinks that true and full euphoria is rare but assumes that it is a fragile state. While conceding the former view, I would depart from the latter view by reinvoking the Cushman analogy. Throughout interaction, interactants look to a "selfobject" (Cushman takes this term from object relations theory) or ritual model or charismatic person/thing/entity to which they may sacrifice themselves in conduct-as rite. Given that ritual intensities are Goffman's true interaction foci and given that rituality charges Goffman's frames so that they can fully involve selves in frames' structural perception and engrossment, we can say that a particular ritual focus is like a substitute superego. It is an anthropomorphic god of the moment. Rituality of interaction when the interactant is a convert therefore has to be jealous, absolute, and beyond human management.</page><page sequence="53">221 (Even charismatic leaders are not unto themselves: they just have better connection to higher powers. In Goffman the superego is always sociology, and it is no accident that Goffman uses the upper case "H" when referring to Durkheim as "He.") Rituality will drag us past Goffman's alienation from interaction. As I have argued, recruits, when alienated from interaction, must be co-contribut? ing to a reality that is alienating them in so far as they are still bound to antithetical realities. For Goffman, that intolerable stasis is the statistical rule of all interactions: because he cannot believe that concerted carrying away will not wreck the interaction vehicle. For Goffman, the as-if-con verted recruit, who only goes through the motions of conversion, lives - as normality - the dismembering stress between the unconvertible presenting self and the evidence this self gives to itself both of self-betrayal and betrayal of the other reciprocally-selved interactants. It follows that alienated interactions, as Goffman says they are, must be very unstable. But I have already provided reasons why Goffman should not generalize instability across all interactions. I have found Goffman guilty of cryogeniz ing interaction reality at a formative stage as a consequence of his stronger belief in an analytic alienation model. Goffman's belief in analysis, I now suggest, is also responsible for his underemphasis of the possibility of what he himself calls euphoric interaction. Euphoric interactions are defined by Goffman (1953:243) as those in which "no one will be made to feel ill at ease, out of countenance, non? plussed, self-conscious, embarrassed, or out of place because of the sheer presence of the others or because of the actions of the others." Anticipating "Alienation from Interaction," Goffman marvels at euphoria's delicate balance of "potentially opposed" factors (ibid:243). I agree with Goffman that euphoric interaction is a delicately balanced achievement, but cannot see why it should not always be powerful and coherent and difficult to destabilize. An example will illustrate. A sym? phony being played by full orchestra is indeed a delicately balanced affair, and one which will be flawed, but not destroyed, by a single wrong note. We might suppose that the more accurately and competently the music is performed the more involving it is, and it goes without saying that musicians hearing their own wrong notes will be motivated to play better. Of course one can resist the music. One can behaviouralize it, as Goffman does interaction, seeing it then, analytically, as the coming together of disparate interactants who, as if deaf to the music they will play, are only inspired to abide by the score and by the morality of going along with its playing in alignment to the conductor's interpretation. But seeing it like that is the same as not hearing the music that we may assume the conductor and the musicians do hear and, more than that, do want to hear it as music. Of</page><page sequence="54">222 course, there is nothing wrong with analysing the symphony into its interactive constituents. This is a legitimate and productive approach. What is to be regretted is the tendency to erect this analysis over the music, and to imply that the music is not music to our sociological ears. When we do that our formal analysis is not a means to realler reality but a modernistic distortion of human experience. My example of the symphony orchestra is faulty in several ways. It presumes a score, it presumes that the audience of interaction is other than the interactants, it presumes that euphoric interaction is an aesthetic achievement. A better example is the jamming of jazz musicians for their own entertainment. Here the presumption might be that the music is an end in itself. On the face of it, it would seem that the jazz has no role in the continuing everyday lives of the interactants, but of course it constitutes the players as jazz musicians. Interaction, likewise, may have any number of institutional relevances, but primarily it constitutes selves who can be institutionally relevant. No interaction, in this sense, means no human institutions. And an absence of euphoria in interaction has to imply selves who are not very self-like, and then imply institutions that follow suit by being impersonal and dehumanized. Perhaps there is precious little euphoria in contemporary Anglo American interactions and in the institutions they sustain, but is that scarcity of euphoria an argument for its inherent interactional instability or for a euphoria that is analytically identical to its dysphoric alternative? I think not. It is important to remember about euphoria that, far from being a loss of control, it is always a heightening of control so as to suck in more constitu? tive psychobiological awareness. Euphoria is incredibly delicate (not fragile), but of such ritual power that the means to it are transcended in the direction of a sharper focus, which is transportative to the degree that it is sharp. That is why audiences in theatres are silent and seated in separate stalls, to allow the focus to sharpen and to allow the resultant euphoria to fuel the focusing. Euphoria is only possible through its enabling discipline. Not only does euphoric interaction emotionally conduce a coordinated ease of choreographic balance but, I suggest, it is the type of interaction through which most people most regeneratively recognize themselves. Its prototype would be the almost universal interaction of emotionally recipro? cal sexual satisfaction, whose ideal forms and ideological commandments saturate our culture, our advertisements, and our vicarious televisual experience. (Censorship preserves these ideal forms as sacral possibility while pornography desacralizes them.) May not Goffman's dysphoric interactions be experienced as such largely because they compare un? favourably with euphoric interaction both in terms of emotional tone and of</page><page sequence="55">223 constituted self? Is not Goffman's alienation only meaningful when set against euphoria? And may not the essential difference between euphoria and dysphoria be that the former absorbs all virtual remainder of self in a heightened awareness of the self as a performance that is as true for the performer as for the audience? Since euphoria is "being moved," it is the most social emotion of all, while dysphoria is sociality aborted. Certainly a sociology of aborted moments may reflect Anglo-American culture as it is but even then it will only have meaning in comparison to the kind of sociability constantly sought in intimate relationships and places of con? viviality (drugs like alcohol and tranquillizers seem specifically designed to facilitate euphoria on the cheap, as if this state is socially desirable in whatever blunted form, but we may note that those drugs may militate against the awareness often claimed for the psychoactive substances which are avidly sought by many young persons who may also be pursuing more affirmative togetherness.) It must be in the interests of interaction - whose interests are those of its produced and converted selves - that, though finely balanced, it is protected against ineptitude or sabotage not always just by the courtesies of life but at times by life itself, a life made possible by interaction. As in the example of musicians, flexibility, durability, and resilience are interaction-protective features of euphoria more than of dysphoria. So euphoric interactants, I would say, are more self-committing and more interactive than cold-war courtiers, and they are effectively euphoric through my concept of hyper involvement, itself depending on highly competent dramaturgical credibility. The example of emotionally reciprocal sexual satisfaction fixes the form of euphoria in a culturally idealized enactment of pure spontaneity that knows second-by-second never to break its own spell. The form is both real and learned, inseparably, and focused on "more reality" in an escalation where biological reinforcement is not necessarily revoked when spent, and not revoked by none other than the selves involved, who, when the biologi? cal activity is wanting, will in their turn reinforce that as far as possible. Yes, reciprocally emotional sexual satisfaction is a precarious unsteady state but it might not be constantly opening into alienation. No, interaction is not necessarily analytically modelled after reciprocally emotional sexual satisfaction but, just the same, it creates realities that are not offended with impunity nor self-prevented from drawing deeply on a psychobiological awareness that in analysing its own realities - with a Goffmanian detach? ment - opposes itself. This is to say that most of us do get on very well with our friends (or "something is wrong"), and do not get on so well when, for instance, trying to sell things to people who have no desire to buy, unless we first make friends with them.</page><page sequence="56">224 The "euphoria" of this section assumes conversion of selves. But selves need not be converted to euphoric interaction. They may be converted to comparatively dysphoric interaction. The dysphoria does not have to be alienation, though. It could be being a self that takes no great pleasure in being itself but nonetheless fully believes it is real in this way only. Even so, the promise of euphoria will play its part in that self's conversion too, as I shall show in the next section, where the process of full conversion is analysed. XTV. The self as an interactional conversion syndrome: Converts Conversion is the opposite of alienation from interaction. But the un? alienated, converted self, just like the alienated self, will not be a self that lies behind the face. It will be a face that has no trouble in smiling and laughing. Its alienated other is the one who has nothing to smile or laugh about even as it too smiles and laughs. (It is a comment on our civilization that, for many, authenticity and reality are now to be pursued in the name of the other.) In conversion, prior selves are purged, and most interactions will consist in re-conversion of the re-emerging prior selves. A description of conversion goes against the grain of my commitment to a vernacular accounting, since it will have to analyse a process that will have no such analytic form for the convert. I am in the paradox here of being poised to analyse a phenomenon whose very nature rejects the possibility of a credible analysis in sociological language. Converts cannot be converts if they can see themselves interactionally produced as such, for, if they could grasp their new credible selves as the products of interaction, those selves would be alienated from themselves inside their selves as analysts. They would be detached, looking on from another reality, that of conversion analysis. A converted self has to be for itself in the Sartrean sense. It must not have the slightest doubt that it is the self it would be, and should be, regardless of the present interactional context. It must view the current reality as a fortuitous catalytic conversion of what was already there in embryo. Yet there is a vernacular way of looking at this, and it has driven my argument all along. If as an interactant I say that I simply do not like or believe in the finality of self-transformations, I can be vernacular, while continuing to sceptically analyse conversion in the hope of transforming my scepticism to belief in the analysis. How can I say this? Only, I think, from the point of view of a self who is being converted to the view that conver? sion is interactional through and through. That self will have to be con</page><page sequence="57">225 verted by its own argument, by its own interactive reality, which is as real as it is as a direct result of having believed in Goffman. From this self's point of view, then, I can analyse conversion, displacing the phenomenon into the actual analysis, so vernacularizing the analysis. The risk I take is of becoming alienated from my own analysis and alienated from a self who could credulously subscribe to his own conclusions. I want to believe and to maintain an analytic stance in the same breath. Or, the "I" of this paper who could believe is no longer the "I" who has to write it. So now I am like the recruit, already behaving as though I believe in a reality that my prior presenting self could not have believed in. Yet this fabrication of reality violates my recruit sense of properly being someone who does not and should not fabricate reality. Not only that but the fabri? cated reality is partly my responsibility, the rest of it being Goffman's and the reader's. But I am sustaining it credibly, and so it is somehow true, somehow mine, somehow not a fabrication. So, if it were true and if the self that sustains it were not alienated from itself, there would be moral relief. And the reality can be true if I can feelingly denounce both my prior self and the self whom I assume will be waiting for me with scepticism, who even now lurks in this analysis and who, as it were, stops me being myself. In conversion the interactant does denounce the old self and does become a believer in the new one. But how can the recruit now believe in something that was always hypothetical? There is only one way. The recruit must have changed. He or she is now transformed, reborn, reconstructed, finally converted. The old self was never the truer self after all, and was in fact responsible for the discomfort that had to be endured before conversion, the very discomfort that I say is the actual interactional work of conversion itself. The final seal of approval that is set on the new self is invariably, moreover, its description as whom the convert has been "deep down" all along, sometimes as far back as the womb (witness the practice of rebirthing). Thus the gentleman produced by a British public school is a "born gentleman," else he could not have stood the privations. The talented composer produced by his or her music is suddenly perceived to have an innate "gift." The converted Christian has got back in touch with his or her immortal soul and the father who is God. Converted selves, I suggest, congeal the interactant in a selective retrospective of those instances that fit the convert, all other instances being declared untrue to him or her, unreal, aberrant, shameful, in need of confession and exorcism. Thus, from every interaction that has gone past its opening cold-war phase there emerge its converts, their minds changed by "fruitful discussions" and so on and so forth, until their next conversion interactions when what has gone before will become unreal.</page><page sequence="58">226 During conversion, says Cushman, there is immense inner relief from profound identity-crisis, plus instant social reward of "unconditional" acceptance of "unconditional" accepting.9 In a word, euphoria. The feeling of being converted, then, is irrefutable, because it is a feeling. But Cushman notes that euphoria is short-lived, and has to be continually re-enacted. So it is not enough to make the case for conversion just once. For it to remain a strong case it must be constantly reiterated, soap-operatically. One is put in mind of ethnomethodology here. Wieder (1969:277) writes that whatever ethnomethodology says about a phenomenon will be an integral part of that phenomenon, rendering any sociological description as "one further instance of the product which results from the uses of practices whereby ... [it] is achieved." The same applies in ethnorituality. An ethnoritual narrative of self is involved with self as one further selving which results from the use of practices whereby selving is achieved. Besides euphoric release from distress there is another gain for the Cushman convert. The convert can feel from the vantage of the new self that at last he or she has a proper understanding of the purged self to whom there is no more attachment. This enlightenment tells the interactant why "whom the self is now" is better than "whom the old self was," or the enlightenment is not enlightenment and raises the spectre of retro-conver? sion. But the converted self, Cushman says, is only an identity by default. It stands in for another one that was stressed out of countenance and it offers security in a void because it will face exactly the same trials by interaction that the old one faced. So the converted self is no different to Goffman's alienated self but for the fact that it is a self and does not feel alienated. I have argued that Goff? man's self is alienated principally in his analysis, and less so in real life. All I have done then is return to the vernacular from the analytic, but to an extent I have done this analytically. In a somewhat alienated way I have shown that even Goffman's alienated self is one that Goffman paradoxi? cally asks readers to believe in and to become converted to as a true proposition of interaction. My conversion gets rid of the Goffman paradox and his paradoxical truth claim, but paradoxically through vernacular alienation from analysis. And it leaves the self as it found it. But not quite. Through interactional conversion there is even less self outside interaction than there was before, and the "more self that there is (in interaction) is an even more vulnerable conception. My converted self may be more ritual, more capable of euphoria, more given to anguish when plunged into negative experience, but for all those reasons it has nowhere else to go but other interactions.</page><page sequence="59">227 XV. Resistance to conversion Can conversion be resisted? I have suggested that the unconvertible interactant is not interactive, and so the answer, at first glance, must be no. To modify this conclusion I now want to widen the first glance and or? chestrate the no. I shall do this by looking at the self in the one work of Goffman where he follows the progress of a self (Asylums) and seeing, from where that self goes, what it is running from. In Asylums Goffman (1971b:ll) tries "to develop a sociological version of the self by ethnographically charting and contextualizing the moral career of a mental hospital inmate. The moral career of an inmate (or any human being) consists in those "progressive changes that occur in the beliefs that he has concerning himself and significant others" (24). After delivery into an institution through a "betrayal funnel," the inmate starts a moral career by undergoing remorseless desacralization. Then, having been "morally humbled" (138), the inmate must live in wards "explicitly employed to frame the conception a person takes of himself (139), where privations rhetoricized as medical treatment are imposed as part of the inmate's alleged need and are "therefore an expression of the state that his self has fallen to" (138). During "treatment" of illness, the inmate "may be confronted by high-ranking staff arguing that his past has been a failure, that the cause of this has been with himself, that his attitude to life is wrong, and that if he wants to be a person he will have to change his way of dealing with people and his conceptions of himself (139). "The key view of the patient is: were he 'himself he would voluntarily seek psychiatric treatment and voluntarily submit to it, and, when ready for discharge, he will avow that this real self was all along being treated as it really wanted to be treated" (326). Cure is the convincing performance of a self converted from mental illness by the psychiatric institution: "The patient must 'insightfully' come to take, or affect to take, the hospital's view of himself (143). Throughout institutionalization, the inmate has a self that "dwells ... in the pattern of social control that is exerted in connexion with the person by himself and those around him" (154). Moreover: "This special kind of institutional arrangement does not so much support the self as constitute it" (154). The reconstitution of the presenting self into the converted (cured) self is not, however, the result of psychiatric intervention, for it is "the privilege system [that] serves to provide the chief framework within which reassembly of the self takes place..." (57). Privileges are conditional upon abiding by the rules of correct ward behaviour, and the rules are many: "In total institutions staying out of trouble is likely to require persistent con? scious effort" (46). So there is a tremendous stress on the inmate to conform</page><page sequence="60">228 to institutional morality, in the first place by enacting quiescent conformism and in the final instance by autonomous self-embodiment as the cured version of the presenting self. To be discharged as cured the inmate will have to be careful to conceal that his or her reconstruction is out of hospital ideology, and the inmate will have to have learned how to pass as made better by medical care. In Asylums Goffman is not interested in the internal selves of inmates who might be hallucinating, lost in abysses of depression, megalomaniacal, paranoid, or just plain anguished. The experience of these violently derang? ing conditions is screened from Goffman by the types of situational im? proprieties they might occasion. Goffman only wishes to know what the social frame of the inmate will permit him or her to do, and therefore be, in a social sense that will project the inmate's coherent inner self according to hospital ideology. Goffman finds that conversion ("the inmate appears to take over the official or staff view of himself and tries to act out the role of the perfect inmate" [63]) is only one of four possibilities, the other three being "situational withdrawal," "intransigence," and "colonization." Typically, inmates "play it cool" (64), that is, they go along with staff reality until out of sight of staff, when they openly support the "counter-mores." The counter-mores or "underlife" of the staff ideology is the scene of inmates' "secondary adjustments" (after the "primary adjustment" of incarceration) that provides "a kind of lodgement for the self, a churinga in which the soul is felt to reside" (56). (Goffman ignores the staff in Asylums, much as he theoretically disdains the main body of sociology in his interaction analysis. The staff and sociology, respectively, are omnipresent, however, but as a threat rather than as recourse in a crisis. Obviously everything Goffman says about inmates applies to the staff, especially when the staff - as many do - live in the hospital in segregated hostels or doctors' apartments and houses. Staff too have selves assembled out of privilege systems. Staff selves are rewarded with privileges that reflect their statuses so long as the fiction is maintained that the rewarded selves are innately worthy of the rewards and not constructed out of these alone. Staff too are typically unconvinced converts of their own ideology, and yet they must act as if they are con? verted, except when out of sight of those who could discredit them when they are practising secondary adjustments. Playing it cool goes on at both sides of the staff-inmate divide. But, whereas inmates have no one else to turn to for human support than other inmates, staff may use inmates to support staff-like selves, and indeed "house-broken" inmates may be only too happy to oblige. This is probably why Goffman feels morally more decent on the side of the inmate and, within sociology, prefers to remain</page><page sequence="61">229 detached from those who begin their sociological writing with the assump? tion that there can be no question that the practice of sociology is moral.) Goffman's argument is that the institution, unable to fulfil its medical function (because it is an institution), still claims that the institutional effects on inmates' selves are the medical treatment and cure. He is himself dismayed that inmates have to undergo and embrace the embittering moral experience of this swindle. Goffman's institution, then, forces inmates to take a detached view of the selves that will be supposed to be getting better or becoming cured. With their civil freedom at stake, inmates are pawns of a shameless game in which selves are routinely mortified and converted, with a minimum of medical caring. This has the effect on the inmate of a moral fatigue and a loosening of the soul: The inmate tends to learn that degradations and reconstructions of the self need not be given too much weight, at the same time learning that staff and inmates are ready to view an inflation or deflation of self with some indifference. He learns that a defensible picture of self can be seen as something outside oneself that can be constructed, lost, and rebuilt, all with great speed and some equanimity. He learns about the viability of taking up a standpoint - and hence a self - that is outside the one which the hospital can give and take away from him. (151) From the point of view of a self that is not of the hospital's construction the inmate may then have an altered view of self itself: Once he learns what it is like to be defined by society as not having a viable self, this threatening definition - the threat that helps attach people to the self society accords them - is weakened. The patient seems to gain a new plateau when he learns that he can survive while acting in a way that society sees as destructive of him. (152) In fact the inmate might become more solid than the institution: ... in the "tough" punishment wards of maximum security, where inmates had very little more to lose, fine examples could be found of patients not going out of their way to make trouble but by their posture conveying unconcern and mild contempt for all levels of the staff, combined with utter self-possession. (279) Goffman observes of such self-possession: "I want to argue that this recalcitrance is not an incidental mechanism of defence but rather an essential constituent of self (279). So Goffman proposes three inmate selves, (a) the unconvinced, or even convinced, convert, (b) the two-faced secondary adjustor, and (c) the ironist gone beyond reach of ideology. The latter category wins Goffman's admiration:</page><page sequence="62">230 Beyond irony ... there is an even more subtle and telling kind of ritual insubordination. There is a special stance that can be taken to alien authority; it combines stiffness, dignity, and coolness in a particular mixture that conveys insufficient insolence to call forth immediate punishment and yet expresses that one is entirely one's own man. Since this communication is made through the way in which the body and face are held, it can be constantly conveyed wherever the inmate finds himself. (278) This I regard as the form of resistance to conversion under the worst possible conditions of coercion. But such resistance is a self in a world that plays vicious games with selves, and it can never sleep, as if following a self-created Hagakure code: "The slightest flaw in word or deed causes the collapse of one's philosophy of life" (Mishima, 1979). I would describe the resisting self - seen like this - as a bodily gesture for other people's interpretation, myself interpreting it as a single-minded sincerity of purpose, the purpose being to refuse the self given by others in such a way as to lift co-interactants into a sense of their inadequacies of self. English gentlemen traditionally had this kind of self made out of no other substance than its irritatingly arrogant sufficiency and quietness. It is my intuitive contention that Goffman too seeks the self of this posture within the total institution that he constructs for himself out of sociology. Though he is a convinced convert, an unconvinced convert, a secondary adjustor, and an ironist, he constantly finds in the churinga of his writing style the very stance that holds him together as a living difference to sociology. To this difference we have to differ, however, or else repeat Goff? man verbatim, which would be immoral, interactively speaking. In a historical perspective the difference of Goffman to sociology may come to seem as profound as Garfinkel's. But Goffman "passed" while Garfinkel seceded. Both of them together, however, have established a margin stronger than a centre that no longer holds. Like it or not, Goffman and Garfinkel are the founders of twenty-first century sociology. Finally, such a postured self as Goffman's is a self that cannot do anything with its gesture but follow it through to the end, like a member of the Light Brigade locked on his own apotheosis. Selves of posture are "dead men on leave," as the Tsar's Cossacks (and, later, Lenin's revolutionists) described themselves. The dead man on leave resists conversion by being converted to an iconic selflessness. He is not about to negotiate anything, and therefore cannot be posited as the undoing of my conversion-of-self thesis. A self that cannot negotiate, by plunging after its glacial destiny goes it own way while everybody else undertakes the work of achieving the world through which it can serenely skate to glory. Feminists might say that only in contact with their own femininity can dead men on leave awaken to emotions that expose a steely resolve as emptiness. And femininity is</page><page sequence="63">231 being-in-itself (Keat, 1983), the substance of reality, the subversion of modernism (Suleiman, 1990). In a denial of the feminine we have the presentation of self and its fulfilment in a cool pose of chilling sincerity. In conversion of self we have analytical parthenogenesis, a new self for postmodernity. Out of the permafrost of modernist sociology we have Garfinkel's last picture show of Routine Grounds and Goffman's crystalline flowers of interaction, and now perhaps a first metamorphosis.10 XVI. Conclusions There can be no conclusion to a conversion-of-self thesis. The reader is either converted to it or not, either as-if-finally or merely for the length of time it takes to read it. Nothing follows from a conversion to the thesis but its reiteration or a conversion from it, hopefully in the latter case construc? tively rather than repressively. However, I might conclude with a quick rear-view-mirror glimpse of the paper as whole, before I pass away into other interactions. Interaction reality, I have said, is real to the degree that it is believed in, and, in so far as it is reader-text interactive, its analysis too is caught in the same belief continuum. There is no question of the analysis representing a reality well or badly, or of misrepresenting it. Ricoeur (1976:16) says: "The experience, as lived, remains private, but its sense, its meaning, becomes public. Communication in this way is the overcoming of the radical noncommunicability of the lived experience as lived." In other words, the analysis is about something it generates in the reader's experience and nowhere else. Falsity is merely incredibility, but with no extensive reference, while truthfulness is credibility with ritual properties of Durkheimian excitation that does not have to stop where the text ends. When the analysis is centred on the credibility of worlds, its own credibility is doubly in question, because if what it says feels incredible then the way it says it, however credible in itself, becomes dreamlike, persuasive but unreal, like Dialectic of Enlightenment or Discipline and Punish. I think it is fair to say that, from the point of view of a "continuing self between interactions, the analysis I have provided of the conversion of self is dreamlike. But I also believe that, in the context of the experience of interactional anguish or of surprising interactional persuasions, the dream is real. And from the position that the dream is real, what is outside the dream is then unreal. This analysis cannot be meant to be final, for the ethnoritual reasons offered. So its credibility is its effective production of a self for the reader who is credibly focused in its terms while reading. That sort of converted</page><page sequence="64">232 self is contrasted, by Ricoeur, with the "ego," a category that in Ricoeur's discourse means "continuing self." In this paper Ricoeur's (1976:95) distinction of self from ego is at home: "I would oppose the self which proceeds from the understanding of the text, to the ego, which claims to precede it. It is the text, with its universal power of world disclosure, which gives a self to the ego." Therefore the conversion-of-self thesis is a thesis that summons a converted self in no obvious relation to selves constituted by readings of other theses. It cannot be judged by those other selves unless they interact and risk their own conversion. Notes 1. "In order to make a law for the impressions of the senses and to substitute a new way of representing reality for them, thought of a new sort had to be founded: this is collective thought. If this alone has had this efficacy, it is because of the fact that to create a world of ideals through which the world of experienced realities would appear transfigured, a superexcitation of the intellectual forces was necessary, which is possible only in and through society" (Durkheim, 1965:237-238). 2. Mead (1962:173) rejects Cooley's and James' self based in "reflexive affective appearances" because for him the self is something you always have, with an origin in thought, which makes the self cognitive. In effect Goffman simply divides off the "I" from Mead's "me," declares the former pure psychobiology, and then invests the "me" with Durkheimian religiosity. Goffman follows Durkheim's (1965:229) pronouncement: "Religious force is only the sentiment inspired by the group in its members, but projected outside of them, and objectified. To be objectified, they are fixed upon some object which thus becomes sacred; but any object might fulfil this function." Goffman's Durkheimian object is the self, a sort of occasioned Meadian "me" plus group dependent sacrality. The "converted" Goffmanian self of this paper taps back into Cooley's and James' self-feelings to account for shame, guilt, and other moral experience. It does this by proposing a strong psychobiological resource, given in the body nature of face-to-face interaction, and this resource is also Mead's "I" but severed from Mead's "me" that is reinvented from the interac? tion order alone. 3. The word "frame" is its own worst enemy. In Goffman's formal definition it could never be fully accounted. Yet we always want to start seeing actual frames as though the act of seeing was not the act of framing that Goffman says it is. Really, there can only be framing, and the idea of a frame is a reification of Goffman's processual insight, a reification that he would correctly defend as the only way of defining the process. But Rawls (1989b), for example, is almost seduced - by frame as a framework - away from process into a dynamic structuralism. At its worst this kind of gravitational pull to framework completely detaches frame from process (Gonos, 1977), and makes Goffman far less ethnomethodological than he is, and less like Simmel too, who on behalf of life analyses life's impoverishment by detached autonomous forms, against which forms - including Simmel's analysis - life</page><page sequence="65">233 expressively rebels in descriptions at no remove (Weinstein and Weinstein, 1990). Goffman and Simmel, not unlike Derrida, perform analyses that know themselves to be redundant if not part of their phenomena. They differ only in their "delay space" of reabsorption. Looked at through Goffman, Simmel, and Derrida, all theories anyway are indexical, having power to the degree that they appear to be formal and objective. Derrida of course would oppose such power and subvert his own exercise of the same. But human bio-power is enhanced when experiential theories transcend their own forms, as Goffman's does by an internal dialogic "spiral" of constant self-refutation (Manning, 1989c). The difference between knowingly ethnomethodological theories and those that do not know they are processual vis-?-vis their readers is the creative scepticism of the former, founded in a constant reformulation of both sides of the data-theory divide. Marx, for example, is ethnomethodological in the large sense I use here when he pushes his theory over the cliff of praxis. But, as I suggested at the beginning of the Introduction, the substance of a theory is also an impediment to the meaning it delivers. So it is with frames. The meaning of frames, I believe, is that they can be seen through, not seen as such, but, as I say, it is difficult to resist the temptation to adumbrate them mentalistically, as Goffman's 586 pages of frame analysis attest. If only frames did not so obviously fall into sharply recognizable forms, they would stay "framative." It is the capacity of framers to arrive at relatively constant forms that fixates us on the forms, when we should be involved in the universal aptitude for instant objectification. Thus I cannot agree with Collins (1986:108) that Frame Analysis is "really an attack on Schutz and Garfinkel" if only because, though there may only be, as Collins suggests, "a limited number of such frames" in terms of a structural taxonomy, there are no signs in Goffman's frame analysis of talk that any taxonomy is so sociologically useful as the notion of framative ness. It is ethnomethodological framativeness that inspires Goffman's taxonomy concerning which, as Goffman (1975:6) says, "there are no grounds for thinking that a thousand additional assumptions" besides his "five or ten rules" for reality constitution "might not be listed by others." 4. During a visit (1980) to Goffman's Shetland research site (the village of Baltasound in the island of Unst), I satisfied myself - in the bar of Presentation of Life's Shetland Hotel - that Shetlanders have as much capacity for convivial sociality as any other group I have known. Goffman's research "field" is, however, very unlike an urban centre for instance) since the natives are spread out thinly, their homes and few places of congregation mostly in full view of one another (there are no trees). The openness to mutual scrutiny (especially in the summer when darkness lasts only an hour or two) together with living conditions that have some affinity to those of a total institution (natives live, work, and play inside the same ecology; natives in 1949 were only linked to the next island down by a thrice-weekly ferry and by telephone connections made through one native operator) is unusual. You do not have to experience what Goffman describes in his PhD as "expressive responsibility" for very long before you begin to see why Goffman (1969), observing under the cover story of studying the crofting economy, will one day develop an extraordinary interest in the life-worlds of spies. It may be relevant to the future under-emphasis of talk in Goffman's sociology that during his period of Shetland residence most crofters, among themselves, spoke a Norwegian-based dialect, fluency in which Goffman does not seem to have acquired. I found no</page><page sequence="66">234 one during my visit who remembered Goffman, but did not have the chance in one week to meet very many of the 300 villagers. 5. And, because it calculates, it has no relation to a Meadian "I." In this paper I regard Mead's "I" as having the same relation to the Goffman "me" as Marx's use-value has to exchange-value in Baudrillard where use-value is the truth effect of exchange-value, and not vice versa. Baudrillard (1981) also shows how the signified of Lacan will be a similar truth-effect of a global signifier system in the demise of pre-capitalist "symbolic exchange." However, I do not believe in Baudrillard's pre-emptive, "superstructural" (Harland, 1987) projection of psychobiology into a realm of pure exchange- and signifier-value because, as Levin (1984; 1988) argues, it implausibly devastates vestigial neonate self-understanding. I imagine a "me-effect" drawing on psychobiology without an intermediary "I." This ought to be put the other way round. The Meadian "I" is my neo-Goffmanian "me," and Mead's "me" is an under experiential reification. 6. In a study of perceived justice in a prison Kohlberg et al. (1973) find that on a scale of moral judgement (based on Rawls' theory of justice) inmates scored the prison low. This is one of the few studies that penetrates to the interactional experience of being treated like a human being. The stages from low to high are (1) coercive power, (2) instrumental exchange, (3) informal norm agree? ment, (4) Weberian norms, and (5) shared principled agreement. Clearly all these stages could be combined in any one interaction, but I would say that 1-4 would not have much credibility unless pointing towards 5. Scharf and Hickey (1976) report a follow-up study (before funding was withdrawn) which demonstrates that a positive moral atmosphere stimulates what they call moral growth. 7. "As the ovation went on for minutes he tried, as if slightly pained, to check it. Then, in a low voice, hesitantly and somewhat shyly, he began a kind of historical lecture rather than a speech. To me there was something engaging about it - all the more so since it ran counter to everything the propaganda of his opponents had led me to expect: a hysterical demagogue, a shrieking and gesticulating fanatic in uniform. He did not allow the bursts of applause to tempt him away from his sober tone. "It seemed as if he were candidly presenting his anxieties about the future. His irony was softened by a somewhat self-conscious humor; his south German charm reminded me agreeably of my native origin. A cool Prussian could never have captivated me that way. Hitler's initial shyness soon disappeared; at times now his pitch rose. He spoke urgently and with hypnotic persuasiveness. The mood he cast was much deeper than the speech itself, most of which I did not remember for long. "Moreover, I was carried away on the wave of the enthusiasm which, one could almost feel this physically, bore the speaker along from sentence to sentence. It swept away any skepticism, any reservations. Opponents were given no chance to speak. This furthered the illusion, at least momentarily, of unanimity. Finally, Hitler no longer seemed to be speaking to convince; rather, he seemed to feel that he was expressing what the audience, by now trans? formed into a single mass, expected of him. It was as if it were the most natural thing in the world to lead students and part of faculty of the two greatest academies in Germany submissively by a leash" (Speer, 1971:45-46). 8. The recent epidemic growth of counselling interaction (Walker, 1986) is</page><page sequence="67">235 instructive here. Once upon a time Freud thought that analysis might need to be interminable. Counselling, however, which does not share Freud's investiga? tive mania for increasingly finessed understanding of prior selves that will eventually integrate in sensitive reformulations of a cured self, works back? wards from whom the counselling ideology wants the client to want to be. And so counselling gets better, if cruder, results, and much faster and much more cheaply than psychoanalysis. But counselling's converted selves cannot last, and should not, given the instability of counselling ideology's ideal selves compared with Freud's fairly stabilized ideal of the white bourgeois ego considerably structured by response to ?lite cultural artefacts that would probably exclude sociology. Moreover, because counselling does not really believe in itself, it has to go on and in more and more spheres of life to prove that it can help everybody in order to prove that it is helpful. 9. Of the conversion experience Mead (1962:219) writes: "This breakdown of barriers is something that arouses a flood of emotions, because it sets free an indefinite number of possible contacts to other people which have been checked, held repressed." 10. Collins (1986) eerily connects with this possibility of metamorphosis when he wonders if Goffman might not have returned to the psychoanalytic interests of his youth, if he had lived. An interesting essay, I believe, could be written showing how Goffman recreates Freud's hydrostatic psyche outside people's heads as the interaction order, which has its superego (moral order), its egos (selves), and its unconscious (unthinking engrossment). Would that such an essay could have been written by Goffman. But Collins could do it if he wanted to. References Baudrillard, J. (1975). The mirror of production. St Louis, MO: Telos Press.
