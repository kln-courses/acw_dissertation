REDUCTIONISM Reductionism, "Bad Science," and Politics: A Critique of Anti-Reductionist Reasoning Ullica Segerstr?le Illinois Institute of Technology, USA Abstract. This article examines the recent political-cum- epistemological criticism of reductionism in fields such as sociobiology, behavioral ecology, behavioral genetics, and IQ research. It identifies and challenges some un- examined assumptions underlying current "anti-reduc- tionist" reasoning, especially the belief that there are inherent links between political motivations and scien- tific convictions, between "bad" science and undesirable political consequences, and between methodological and ontological reductionism. The author analyzes the con- flict in scientific world views between anti-reductionist "weeders" and reductionist "planters." Paradoxically, in their criticism of research strategies routinely used by alleged reductionists, anti-reductionists often sound like arch-reductionists themselves. The author argues that the various linked beliefs in anti-reductionist rea- soning should be uncoupled, not only for intellectual, but also for political reasons. Ullica Segerstr?le, a native of Finland, is Assistant Professor of Sociology in the Department of Social Sciences, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL 60616, USA. After earning degrees in natural and social sciences, she came to study in the United States under a Fulbright grant. Following completion of an MA in Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, she earned a Ph.D. in Sociology at Harvard University, writing a dissertation on the sociobiology controversy. Her most general research interest is the criteria scientists use for identifying "good" and "bad" science. Dr. Segerstr?le has authored articles and book chapters on scientific controversy, scientific error and fraud, fringe and pseudoscience, the sociology of scientific knowledge, social theory, and science education. She is currently involved in the international project, "Biological Foundations of Human Culture," at Zentrum f?r Interdisziplin?re Forschung (ZIF) at the University of Bielefeld in Germany. THE LONGSTANDING SCIENTIFIC debate over reductionism versus anti-reductionism has been revived and reformulated in recent years in connection with sociobiology, behavioral ecology, be- havioral genetics, and IQ research. Traditionally, criti- cism of reductionism has been epistemological, methodological, or ontological.1 During roughly the last two decades, however, the Western academic world has seen an increasing attack on reductionism based on its perceived political consequences. Meanwhile, the critics have given reductionism a new meaning, making it syn- onymous with biological determinism (e.g., Gould, 1978; Rose, 1982a, 1982b; Lewontin, 1983; Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin, 1984). One formulation is as follows: Biological determinism is, then, a reductionist ex- planation of human life in which the arrows of causality run from genes to humans and from hu- mans to humanity. But that is more than mere explanation: It is politics. For if human social or- ganization, including the inequalities of status, wealth, and power, are a direct consequence of our biologies, then, except for some gigantic program of genetic engineering, no practice can make a significant alteration of social structure or of the position of individuals or groups within it. (Lewon- tin, Rose, and Kamin, 1984:18) My aim in this paper is to examine the scientific and political convictions behind such a redefinition, to show how this redefinition works as a tool for attacking a variety of scientific targets, and to show how it at the same time sets the anti-reductionists' own scientific and political agenda.

Beech Tree Publishing 1992 199</page><page sequence="2">Reductionism, "Bad Science," and Politics Who are the "anti-reductionists" and who are the "reductionists"? The anti-reductionists are an eclectic group of academics with the common political goal of fighting "biological d?terministe" by proving the latter? claims both scientifically false and politically dangerous. To the first group belong, among others, the cosigners of the letter against sociobiology in the New York Review of Books (Allen et al., 1975; reprinted in Caplan, 1978), the group Science for the People in the U.S., and, Science for People in the U.K. Included are biologists, medical researchers, psychologists, and anthropologists, but also academics from such seemingly unrelated fields as physics and chemistry.2 The reductionists, in turn, are academics studying various biological aspects of human or animal behavior, such as sociobiology, behavioral ecology, behavioral genetics, and IQ research. Several clarifications are in order. When I speak of "reductionists" and "anti-reductionists," I am obviously dealing with a composite set of attitudes among mem- bers within each camp, something like Max Weber's ideal types. Moreover, while I believe that politically active "anti-reductionists" would probably agree with my categorization, many of their targets, the purported "reductionists," may be surprised to be so labeled, since these scientists typically follow the established logic and methods of their respective fields without attributing deep epistemological-cum-political meaning to their approach (or, to the extent they do, I suspect it is largely because of their critics' recent "consciousness-raising" efforts). Finally, there is admittedly a certain irony in calling the opponents of reductionism "anti- reductionists," as will become apparent later. In the following, I will address and challenge some of the recent criticisms of reductionism. The common ele- ment in these criticisms is that reductionists are pres- umed to commit scientific errors for ideological reasons. As we shall see, sometimes the demonstration of this point stretches the imagination. I will try to demonstrate that the presumed connection between reductionism, "bad science," and politics is contingent, not inherent, and, I will analyze the particular logic-in-operation that makes this connection appear necessary and unproblem- atic. I will also question some of the assumptions of this logic and discuss how such a logic leads to paradoxes in the anti-reductionist position. Finally, I will consider some practical consequences of the critics* definition of the situation for science and society. For readers who are sympathetic with two decades of eloquent criticisms of "reductionism," the attempt to analyze matters (or worse, to criticize the critics' reason- ing), may appear politically suspect. Readers who are not sympathetic with these criticisms may argue that I give the critics too much credit. My motivation is primarily intellectual?I see a need for an anatomy of this whole critical thought conundrum, which seems to have gone surprisingly unchallenged so far. Anti-reductionists take for granted that their targets make assumptions, construct models, or employ formulas for expressly political reasons Political Motivations and Scientific Convictions Anti-reductionists take for granted that their targets make assumptions, construct models, or employ formu- las for expressly political reasons. This means that every- thing reductionists do will be scrutinized for underlying political motives, and that no nonpolitical explanations of their conclusions will be acceptable. The task of the critics of sociobiology, IQ research, and the like, then becomes to show the "innocent layman" how political ideology inevitably leads to false science. In the follow- ing, I will give examples of how the anti-reductionists' analytical machinery works in practice. However, first I want to cast doubt on the whole idea that there is an inherent link between a scientist's scientific views and his or her political convictions. Since the main target of the critics of reductionism are scientists who supposedly are promoting biological determinism and thereby sustaining the social status quo, the obvious implication is that an environmentalist position would be politically acceptable. In fact, the attack on the idea of a genetic basis for human behavior as conservative or worse has been evident in the writings of the critics of IQ research and sociobiology from the very beginning (the clearest formulations are in Allen et al., 1975 and Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the People, 1976). But it is, of course, neither logically necessary nor historically true that a "hereditarian" (reductionist) po- sition is associated with conservatism and an "environ- mentalist" (anti-reductionist) position with progressive thought, even though the critics never bring up this fact. Many hereditarians were socialist reformers. Examples include the left-wing biologists in Britain in the 1930s (Werskey, 1978) and the early eugenicists in Germany and the Soviet Union (Graham, 1977).3 E. O. Wilson (1975b, 1976), in response to his critics, points out the interest of such left-wing intellectuals as Noam Chomsky and Herbert Marcuse in the biological basis of human nature. From Chomsky's and Marcusens point of view, there are good political reasons for arguing for a relatively fixed human nature, since postulating an end- lessly malleable human nature would legitimize any oppressive social regime (Chomsky, 1975; Marcuse, 1955). For a left-wing academic, there are thus two alterna- tive routes, the hereditarian and the environmentalist, 200 Politics and the Life Sciences August 1992</page><page sequence="3">Reductionism, "Bad Science," and Politics and it is not obvious which is the more politically desir- able or correct one, particularly since the perspectives may also correspond to long-term versus short-term po- litical strategies. Chomsky and Richard Lewontin found that, prominent left-wing activists though they were, they had quite divergent views on the nature of human nature and its political meaning.4 Roger Masters (1982) points out that it is a mistake to identify sociobiology automatically with conservative political thought. In his view, sociobiological thinking and its central idea of inclusive fitness theory is clearly part of the individualistic tradition in Western thought, but this tradition may be used for either conservative or radical purposes. According to Masters, the reason why sociobiology has been treated as a politically conserva- tive ideology when applied to humans is that the critics have collapsed two existing parallel distinctions in the Western theoretical tradition: on the one hand, the dis- tinction between systematic theories and individualistic theories of the cost-benefit or social contract type, and, on the other hand, the distinction between political right and left. Here they ignore that many systemic theories have been conservative (e.g., Durkheim) and many indi- vidualistic theories radical (e.g., Rousseau). In this general climate of collapsed distinctions, one way to question the anti-reductionists' assumptions about their targets' political motivations is to see to what extent these assumptions hold up empirically. This leads directly to the question, what is, in fact, the political orientation of modern sociobiologists? Because of their presumed biological determinist positions, they have often been accused of being linked with racism and with various unsavory right-wing political movements, par- ticularly Nazism. But the connection between right-wing political interests and sociobiology, however suggestive and politically useful, is not well-supported in practice. In fact, one could make the opposite political case just as well, as Pierre van den Berghe has pointed out: Actually, a review of the politics of leading socio- biologists would lend more credence to the conten- tion that sociobiology is a Communist conspiracy: J. B. S. Haldane, who is generally credited for having first hit on the notion of kin selection?a theoretical cornerstone of sociobiology?was a leading member of the British Communist Party, so was John Maynard Smith. E. O. Wilson and most other leading sociobiologists are left-of- Where a specific reductionist stands politically should be considered an empirical question center liberals or social democrats. "Racist" Tri- vers is even married to a Jamaican and is heavily involved in radical black politics. (1981:406) The least one can say, then, is that where a specific reductionist stands politically should be considered an empirical question. But that is not the kind of investiga- tion that is typically of interest to left-wing intellectuals. They seem to prefer their own method of inquiry, which involves subjecting their targets' statements or theories to various types of scrutiny for ideological assumptions (see Segerstr?le, 1990c, for a meta-critique of general tendencies in current academic criticism). Anti-Reductionist Reasoning Strategies The critics of sociobiology and IQ research discount the possibility that choices made by scientists in these fields are motivated by other than political concerns, that is, that the choices are theoretically supported or based on heuristic considerations. A good case in point is the general onslaught on E. O. Wilson by the Sociobiology Study Group in 1975. This group formulated their criti- cism of Sociobiology (Wilson, 1975a) as if Wilson was both politically and scientifically a "bad" scientist. This means that they did not limit themselves to the argument that sociobiological theorizing could not or should not be extended to humans, but also depicted Wilson's general views on evolutionary biology as old-fashioned (e.g., regarding the role of adaptation in evolution and the nature of genes). It did not matter that Wilson, in his book's overview of contending perspectives on evolutionary theory, had favorably discussed Lewontin's view of the genome as an interacting whole and had explicitly recognized the prob- able limited applicability of heritability formulas based on single-locus genetics. It also did not matter that Wil- son then explicitly stated his heuristic decision: that he was, despite all, going to provisionally use existing for- mulas until better ones could be developed (Wilson, 1975a:70). In order to fit the critics' logic-in-operation, Wilson had to be dismissed as both a bad and old- fashioned scientist.5 If general sociobiology was bad, human sociobiology was worse. It was inconceivable for the critics that a view on any aspect of the biology of human behavior could be held on other than political grounds. This was particu- larly the case with tentative findings in the field of human behavioral genetics. Here Wilson (like many other re- spected members of the scientific community, including many biologists) was of the opinion that the results were relatively well established, despite the well-known meth- odological difficulties of twin studies (which he also discussed in Sociobiology). Again, Wilson may be de- picted as a typical pragmatic scientist who makes a series Politics and the Life Sciences August 1992 201</page><page sequence="4">Reductionism, "Bad Science," and Politics of heuristic decisions to be able to do something. It can be argued that Wilson for practical reasons needed to postulate behavioral genes in humans, since the popula- tion genetic formulas he wished to develop were based on the idea of an available genetic variation in human behavioral traits (Segerstr?le, 1986).6 In their zeal to combat biological determinism, the opponents of sociobiology have typically taken an abso- lutist, not to say unrealistic, view of science. It seems that for these critics, scientists are not allowed to operate with data or methods that are commonly accepted in their own fields. The critics acknowledge no gray area of knowledge, where different "expert opinions" could le- gitimately prevail?the situation can be only black or white. What we have are good and bad scientists, and these have correct versus incorrect, or modern versus old-fashioned views.7 With such a "critical heuristic" in operation, whereby politically bad science is presumed also to be scientifi- cally bad, an obvious strategy for the critics is to look for errors in their targets' texts. Since bad science is moti- vated by political ideology, and no other possible reasons for bad science are considered, it follows that scientific errors can only be attributed to political motives. What are counted as errors here are not merely such mistakes as wrong referencing or incorrect formulas (which are given due attention by the critics), but also "errors" that are in fact field-specific conventions, methodological necessities, heuristic choices, or general problems in researching the biology of behavior (for a more detailed discussion, see Segerstr?le, 1983). The biggest error, of course, is reductionism itself (e.g., Lewontin, 1976, 1979).8 Thus, it is not surprising that the anthropomorphic language of sociobiology was seen as fundamentally po- litical by the critics (e.g., Allen et al., 1975, Sociobiology Study Group, 1976; Alper, Beckwith, and Miller, 1978; Leeds, 1981-82), and the emphasis on adaptation and optimization was equated with conservative politics. In this type of critical climate, the language of some socio- biologists, particularly the British ones, has been a cause of great irritation to anti-reductionist semanticists. It seems that in British biology there is a tradition of making a logical point about an evolutionary mechanism by using vivid scenarios, in which the actors may be human or nonhuman. Unfortunately, this point has been missed by many critics, who take every word literally and scrutinize the text for explicit or hidden political messages. Richard Dawkins's The Selfish Gene (1976), for example, was completely misunderstood and mis- represented. That book aimed at elucidating the logic of a "gene's eye" perspective, an important aid in under- standing the new sociobiological ideas of inclusive fitness, kin selection, and behavioral strategies. Unlike Wilson's Sociobiology, Dawkins's book explicitly Only under the common umbrella of "biological determinism" or "reductionism" can Dawkins and Wilson be seen as delivering the same message excluded human behavior and even warned the reader not to be mistaken about the author's intentions: This brings me to the first point I want to make about what this book is not. I am not advocating a morality based on evolution. I am saying how things have evolved. I am not saying how we hu- mans morally ought to behave. I stress this, because I know I am in danger of being misunderstood by those people, all too numerous, who cannot distin- guish a statement of belief in what is the case from an advocacy of what ought to be the case. (1976:3) Dawkins's disclaimer was ignored, and instead the book was analyzed for ominous political and moral messages. Dawkins was quite incorrectly seen as being "the same" as Wilson, despite the fact that these evolutionary bio- logists, scientifically and morally, represented quite dif- ferent sociobiologies. Dawkins embraced the new theory of kin selection, while Wilson regarded kin selection as just one of the mechanisms for altruistic behavior, on a par with group selection (see Dawkins's critique of Wil- son?Dawkins, 1979). And while Wilson in his last chapter of Sociobiology felt comfortable extrapolating his sociobiological mod- eling to human society, Dawkins in his last chapter put a deliberate stop to such applications by postulating a different mechanism for the transmission of human cul- ture, including a new unit for transmission, the "m?me" (for representative criticisms of Dawkins, see Lewontin, 1976 and Midgley, 1980; for a response to Midgley, sec Dawkins, 1981b; and for analysis, see Segerstr?le, 1990a). It is only under the common umbrella of "biolog- ical determinism" or "reductionism" that Dawkins and Wilson can be seen as delivering the same message. How does one now demonstrate (for the benefit of the "innocent layman" and others) that it is a scientist's political bias that is the cause of "bad science," at least in fields that have serious sociopolitical implications? The critics believe that if one simply examines closely the texts of "bad" scientists, such texts are bound to exhibit both political ideology and scientific error. The general strategy used by the critics in the IQ and sociobiology controversies is probably best demonstrated in Lewon- tin's criticism of Arthur Jensen in 1970. Jensen, in a 202 Politics and the Life Sciences August 1992</page><page sequence="5">Reductionism, "Bad Science, " and PoUtics notorious article, had hypothesized that inherited fac- tors might be implicated in the observed 15 point dif- ference in average white and black IQ scores (Jensen, 1969). Lewontin's criticism concentrated particularly on genetically illegitimate assumptions and invalid extrapo- lation from individual to group differences. But what is of interest to us is Lewontin's critical strategy: I shall try, in this article, to display Professor Jen- sen's argument, to show how the structure of his argument is designed to make his point and to reveal what appear to be deeply embedded as- sumptions derived from a particular world view, leading him to erroneous conclusions. (Lewontin, 1970:2) Lewontin later expanded his critique to the entire area of research in cognitive abilities. He categorically stated that it "could not" be genuine scientific desire that was motivating the students of IQ, because "the only truly scientifically interesting questions about cognitive traits can be asked at the molecular level" (Lewontin, 1975a). Therefore, it "must" be their underlying sociopolitical bias that was driving the researchers in this field to bad science. Here, then, we had the reason for the "careless- ness, shabbiness and intellectual dishonesty" that Le- wontin thought characterized that field.9 Conflicting Views of Science So far I have tried to challenge the belief that there is an inherent connection between political motivation and bad science in the thinking of sociobiologists and IQ researchers, i.e., in "reductionist" thought. On the other hand, I have identified this belief as a central tenet of "anti-reductionist" thought. In the following, I will at- tempt to separate analytically the scientific and moral- political components of anti-reductionist reasoning to demonstrate how both components differ from those of the reductionists. I will start with the difference in overall scientific world view between the reductionists and anti- reductionists. This is best illustrated by examining some of the many meta-theoretical differences between E. O. Wilson and Richard Lewontin (see also Segerstr?le, 1983, 1986). Even though this particular comparison does not encompass all aspects of the opposition be- tween reductionists and anti-reductionists, it nicely brings out the fundamental epistemologica!, methodo- logical, and ontological differences between the two camps. However, it should be pointed out that many anti-reductionists are against sociobiology and IQ re- search simply as bad and dangerous scientific ap- proaches to human behavior, without feeling a need to invoke larger metaphysical scenarios. When it comes to the best way for science to capture reality, both Wilson and Lewontin have made explicit statements about their views (but, significantly, not in polemic with one another). Wilson considers parsimony a fundamental scientific principle: for him, deliberate oversimplification is crucial for theory formation (Wil- son, 1971b). Lewontin takes the opposite position: for him, the complexity of the real world can be accurately captured only by making theory more complex (Levins and Lewontin, 1980; see Simberloff, 1980a, 1980b for a different view and a criticism). This fundamental epistemological/ontological dif- ference is the key to understanding much of Lewontin's criticism of sociobiology (especially the sociobiologies of Wilson and Dawkins). Using this interpretation, the scientific reason why Lewontin has been systematically attacking "the adaptationist program" and optimization theory in modern biology is because these are, in his view, based on nonpermissible generalizations about the (complex) natural world (e.g., Lewontin, 1972a, 1976, 1977,1979,1982; Gould and Lewontin, 1979). But inter- estingly, Wilson would agree to much of this theoretical criticism: he, for instance, considered Lewontin's 1979 paper, "Sociobiology as an Adaptationist Program," to be "good criticism" (interview with Wilson in 1981). On the other hand, for sociobiological models and formulas to work, certain heuristic assumptions have to be made, including treating adaptation as the only force of interest in natural selection, or, as mentioned earlier, postulating hypothetical genes "for" behavioral traits. Without such heuristic assumptions, there is not much Wilson or other sociobiologists can do in practice. But Lewontin is convinced that we need to depict reality accurately. This is also why for him mere testa- bility is not an adequate criterion for an acceptable scientific theory, although it would be sufficient for most other scientists, including Wilson. For Lewontin, a the- ory, in addition to being testable, has to be a true account of an underlying process in the real world. Or, as John Maynard Smith put it: "Dick likes there to be decent causes for things" (interview with Maynard Smith in 1981). This means that Lewontin is opposed to models and theories involving statistical calculations and constructs because these do not have a "real" basis in nature or, alternatively, presume a stochastic universe without proper causal laws?i.e. he is opposed to such an ap- proach to science on ontological grounds. It is, then, in "Dick likes there to be decent causes for things" John Maynard Smith Politics and the Life Sciences August 1992 203</page><page sequence="6">Reductionism, "Bad Science, " and Politics the light of this basic ontological commitment that one must see his criticism of analysis of variance (Lewontin, 1974b), the calculation of "average genetic fitness" by followers of the Fisher school in population genetics (e.g., his opposition to Dawkins?Lewontin, 1977), sto- chastic models in ecology (Levins and Lewontin, 1980), and his later discussion of the "reification" of IQ (Le- wontin, 1981c). Obviously, Wilson's approval of all types of statistical tools, and his additional suggestion that social phenomena ought to be treated as statistical for ease of scientific analysis, was absolutely anathema to Lewontin. In fact, Wilson's ambitious hope was that statistics would be the tool for unifying the natural and social sciences (Wilson 1971a:319; 1971b, 1977). There is no doubt that Wilson was deliberately push- ing quantitative methodology as far as he could, hoping to make evolutionary biology more scientific (in the same manner that he had structured the field of biogeo- graphy together with Robert MacArthur (MacArthur and Wilson, 1967; see also Segerstr?le, 1986). The irony here is that Wilson's aim was to establish a "new holism" in evolutionary biology, putting an earlier, scientifically intractable tradition of "metaphysical holism" on scien- tific grounds with the help of mathematical models (Wil- son, 1975a:7). In fact, as will be evident later in this article, Wilson's ambitions in the 1960s were very similar to those of Richard Levins, although Wilson did not share the latter's Marxist convictions. At that time Le- wontin also had an interest in modeling and game theory, and was in fact a member of a small group of would-be innovators in evolutionary biology that also included Wilson, Levins, MacArthur, and L.B. Slobodkin. How- ever, Lewontin abandoned game theory later when he became a Marxist under the tutelage of Levins (Seger- str?le, 1983,1986). It must be emphasized that Wilson's and Lewontin's conflicting approaches to science represent more than methodological differences. As I have shown elsewhere, Wilson and Lewontin had long-term moral-cum- scientific agendas that were objectively on a collision course even before the beginning of the sociobiology controversy (Segerstr?le, 1986). Wilson's modeling ap- proach was his means to achieve two main goals: (1) laying the foundation for a "new holism" in evolutionary biology with the help of models involving population genetics (his scientific agenda), and (2) "proving the theologians wrong" by explaining religion biologically and substituting for divine prophecy a sociobiological formula for "the trajectory of mankind" (his moral agen- da).10 Lewontin, in turn, felt compelled by his later scientific and moral-political commitments to criticize models in general, and especially sociobiological models involving humans, as both scientifically and politically suspect (Segerstr?le, 1986). Wilson and Lewontin illustrate the point that we are dealing with two completely different approaches to science, but the situation is admittedly complicated by the fact that Wilson, unlike most reductionists, has his own moral-cum-scientific agenda. I will now discuss the more general opposition between mainstream scientists in sociobiology and IQ research and their critics. The Legitimacy of Measurement Even though sociobiologists and IQ researchers use models and formulas involving hypothetical genes, this does not mean that there is not the underlying assump- tion and hope that the material, molecular basis for postulated behavioral or cognitive traits will eventually be found (Segerstr?le, 1983, 1986). Wilson was quite clear about this in Sociobiology, and this also seems to be the belief behind Jensen's continuous focus on a factor for "general intelligence," the so-called g, that so appears to have irritated his critics (Jensen, 1979, 1985). For purported reductionists, modeling and statistics are a provisional way of reaching the ultimate goal. Measure- ment is an indirect way of approaching the real phe- nomenon. For their critics, it is experimental science that holds the secret to scientific success, not models based on "unrealistic" assumptions or statistical formulas. These scientists want real, not hypothetical genes. In their view, statistical analysis cannot substitute for a real understanding of phenomena, which is, after all, the aim of science (on this last point, see Layzer, 1972).11 For those scientists who are accustomed to indirect methods because of the nature of their subject matter, this is at the very least puzzling. Early in the IQ con- troversy, Jensen tried to explain the scientific rationale behind IQ research: Disagreements and arguments can perhaps be forestalled if we take an operational stance. First of all, this means that probably the most important factor about intelligence is that we can measure it. Intelligence, like electricity, is easier to measure than to define. And if the measurements bear some systematic relationships to other data, it means that we can make meaningful statements about the phenomenon we are measuring. There is no point in arguing the question to which there is really no answer, the question of what intelligence really is. The best we can do is obtain measurements of certain kinds of behavior and look at their relation- ships to other phenomena and see if these relation- ships make any kind of sense and order. It is from these orderly relationships that we gain some understanding of the phenomena. (Jensen, 1969:4, quoted in Layzer, 1972:272) This approach to science was strongly rebutted by the physicist David Layzer, one of the critics of Jensen's IQ 204 Politics and the Life Sciences August 1992</page><page sequence="7">Reductionism, "Bad Science, " and Politics The problem is only that the research is of the "wrong" kind research. According to Layzer, the idea of an "oper- ational stance" is based on a profound misunderstanding of what physical scientists really do. According to him, the first and crucial step in natural scientific research is not measurement, but instead the decision of what to examine. This means that there has to be a theory to guide the investigation and it is only on the basis of hypotheses derived from this theory that measurements are made, in order to compare prediction with empirical data. In Layzer's view, statistical analysis is not a sub- stitute for a real understanding of phenomena. Stephen J. Gould took a different tack in his criticism of Jensen, arguing that Jensen's real error was the "re- ification" of general intelligence^, a statistical construct (Gould, 1981). According to Gould, the problem with g is that it reduces intelligence, a multidimensional con- cept, to a single dimension. Further, Gould maintained, because g is an artifact, it does not represent an under- lying physical reality. Gould particularly dislikes "the practice of assuming that the mere existence of a factor, in itself, provides a licence for causal speculation" (Gould, 1981:268). Against such criticism, Jensen again attempted to justify his approach scientifically: In fact, what Gould has mistaken for 'reification' is neither more nor less than the common practice in every science of hypothesizing explanatory models or theories to account for the observed relationships within a given domain. Well known examples in- clude the heliocentric theory of planetary motion, the Bohr atom, the electromagnetic field, the kinetic theory of gases, gravitation, quarks, Men- delian genes, mass, velocity, etc... .The g factor, and theories attempting to explain g in terms of models independent of factor analysis itself, are essentially no different from the other constructs of science listed above... . Would Gould then deny psychol- ogy the common right of every science to the use of hypothetical constructs or any theoretical speculation concerning causal explanations of its observable phenomena? (Jensen, 1982:121-135; emphasis added) I have used these two quotes by Jensen to illustrate, on the one hand, the similarity between the scientific ap- proaches of IQ research and sociobiology, and, on the other hand, the clear opposition of such critics as Layzer, Gould, and Lewontin to these approaches. For Wilson and Jensen, there is a need to use hypothetical constructs and statistical methods to map unknown territory. For the critics, however, the important thing is to establish "true" causality, and they believe the road to true cau- sality cannot involve the heuristics of correlational analysis. Now, it appears that the critics would not be opposed to all research in intelligence?the problem is only that the research is of the "wrong" kind. As Lewontin said in 1975: All research on the genetics of normal human intelligence has been of a statistical nature, using the techniques of biometrical genetics to estimate genetic and environmental sources of variation in specific populations. There has not been, and in the present state of developmental and neural bi- ology cannot be, any attempt to analyze cellular and developmental mechanisms of gene action in influencing cognitive traits. (1975a:401; emphasis added) Lewontin, as we saw earlier, believes that the only truly scientifically interesting questions about cognitive traits must be asked at the molecular level. Gould, in a biology textbook coauthored with Singer and Luria, also sub- scribes to the idea of genetically controlled cognitive traits as a legitimate object of study (Luria, Gould and Singer, 1981:308). But what is going on here? How is it that, on the one hand, human intelligence is an acceptable object of re- search, but, on the other hand, current IQ research is unacceptable? Why is it that scientists like Wilson and Jensen are being attacked as bad scientists despite the fact that they abo are hoping for the real molecular level eventually to be found (Wilson, in Sociobiology, pinning his hopes on neurophysiology)? On the face of it, Wilson, Jensen, and their critics seem to have the same long-term scientific goal. This is not to deny that Wilson and Jensen may have made errors (indeed, error-finding in Jensen's work has been quite an industry in psychology). The question, instead, is this: If the critics consider the aim of investigating possible genetic foundations for human cognitive traits to be legitimate, what is wrong with using models and statistical methods as part of that investigation?12 My guess is that here enters a largely unexplicated political consideration. The great distrust of statistics among the critics may not be based solely on epistemol- ogy or ontology, but may be grounded in fears of "mis- measurement" of various kinds. Obviously, one of the "problems" with statistics is that it is easy to calculate averages, which may lead to treating individuals as sta- tistical averages of their respective groups, thereby invit- ing stereotyping and discrimination. This fear may have animated Stephen Jay Gould in his book, The Mismeasure of Man (1981), and led to puzzle- Politics and the Life Sciences August 1992 205</page><page sequence="8">Reductionism, "Bad Science, " and Politics ment among some of the book's reviewers. They could not see exactly what Gould was opposed to, particularly since he apparently recognized the importance and legit- imacy of testing in such cases as diagnosing learning disabilities among individuals (Ravitch, 1982; Samelson, 1982). Gould chastised early IQ testers as "bad" scien- tists and implied that they were responsible for discrimi- natory measures against U.S. immigrants early in this century. Still, he seemed to admit that the results of current IQ tests were valid in the sense that they could be used as predictors of social success (however, without telling us anything about the nature of intelligence as such?Gould, 1981). Perhaps the simple rule for understanding Gould would be that for him individual testing is acceptable, but group testing is not acceptable, because any measure- ment that can be used for comparison will be used as a tool for ranking and discrimination. Or it may be that for Gould the assessment of a multitude of individual "fac- tors" for intelligence is acceptable, but the idea of a general factor is not, because a general factor is easier to use for ranking. (But it is not clear how this would solve the problem, since if one insisted on creating devices for ranking, one could quite easily obtain an average from the test scores for these individual factors, or, for in- stance, decide that one of these factors was the most socially valuable one). But here one could ask if it is really IQ testing as such or the fundamental interest in the measurement of performance, typical of such so- cieties as the United States, that should ultimately be criticized?13 Lewontin also seems to have a strong opposition to the idea of averages. In fact, he linked Dawkins's idea of the selfish gene to the idea of averages: I mean, it is absolutely the case that one can calculate an average fitness of a gene, one can always calculate it, but it turns out that the fitness constantly changes with the frequency of the geno- types when the population changes: it is nothing but a calculation. And his error?I think it is an error of reification?is to think that because he can assign a number to a thing that that thing somehow is real and causal. It is exactly the same error as saying: Look, I can calculate the average height of a population. But the average height is not a natu- ral attribute of any natural object.. .it is a statistical construct. (Interview with Lewontin in 1981; Segerstr?le, 1983) Not surprisingly, Dawkins's attitude is labeled "an epis- temologica! error" by Lewontin, an error that comes from "a lack of understanding of population genetics" (Segerstr?le, 1983). This is interesting, since according to a review by Maynard Smith, another eminent popula- tion geneticist, neither The Selfish Gene nor Dawkins's later book, The Extended Phenotype (1981c), contain any logical errors. This assessment seems to go together with Maynard Smith's position that an atomic theory of gene- tics or even of human culture is not necessarily wrong (Maynard Smith, 1982). But for our purposes it is more interesting to look at the statement in the middle of the quote. The assump- tion is that Dawkins (or anyone else) would believe that as soon as you can calculate something, that thing is real. But obviously one does not have to believe in reified average fitnesses in order to find them useful in models, nor in the reality of average height (or IQ) to use such a number as a standard for comparison. What unifies the critics of sociobiology and IQ re- search, then, is an opposition to calculation and mea- surement, or any indirect methods in science, that their opponents consider legitimate and typical for science. Thus, in addition to the political considerations involved, the critics have basic objections of a metascientific, or even an ontological, nature. The above discussion of scientific error is also an example of what may happen when different fields or subfields in science end up using the same term? "gene"?in different ways to suit their own specific pur- poses. As I have pointed out elsewhere (Segerstr?le, 1992), it seems that "real" geneticists simply do not recognize the right of evolutionary biologists to postu- late hypothetical genes. These geneticists want to see and manipulate real genes. No wonder, then, that they tend to use the word "erroneous" when they speak of socio- biologists' notions of genes, or may dismiss the latter's views as misleading "gene talk" (Howe and Lyne, 1992). Reductionism and Scientific Practice It seems that the reason for some critics' attacks on modelers is that they believe that their own approach is somehow "truer" scientifically. Obviously, this can hard- ly be proven by any external adjudication, since these two approaches presuppose fundamentally different concep- tions of science. But why is a "reductionist" view wrong? This is the answer given by Levins and Lewontin: The error of reductionism as a general point of view is that it supposes the higher-dimensional object is somehow imposed* of its lower- dimensional projections, which have ontological primacy and which exist in isolation, the 'natural' parts of which the whole is composed. (1985:271) Interestingly, Levins and Lewontin seem convinced that because of this implied ontological commitment in mod- ern science, real practicing scientists are also automat- ically ontological reductionists. But, obviously, commitment to a reductionist methodology does not re- 206 Politics and the Life Sciences August1992</page><page sequence="9">Reductionism, "Bad Science," and Politics quire commitment to a reductionist metaphysics. That is an empirical question. Dawkins observed a similar prob- lem in Not in Our Genes (Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin, 1984): Why do Rose et al. find it necessary to reduce a perfectly sensible belief (that complex wholes should be explained in terms of their parts) to an idiotic travesty (that the properties of a complex whole are simply the sum of those same properties in the parts)? "In terms of covers a multitude of highly sophisticated causal interactions, and math- ematical relations of which summation is only the simplest. Reductionism, in the "sum of the parts" sense is obviously daft, and is nowhere to be found in the writings of real biologists. Reductionism, in the "in terms of sense, is, in the words of the Medawars, "the most successful research strata- gem ever devised." (1985:59) It may be easier to attack an implicit metaphysical as- sumption than to give examples of a truly non-reduction- ist approach in scientific research. Indeed, when it comes to convincing practicing scientists about the need to abandon reductionism, the problem is that it seems dif- ficult to find examples of non-reductionist approaches in science that are not construable as reductionist. The best example is perhaps Levins and Lewontin's claim in 1976 that they had been developing an alternative, non- reductionist approach to science, hoping to capture ac- curately those interaction phenomena with which reductionist methodology was unable to cope. This is the way these biologists described their efforts: As working scientists in the field of evolutionary genetics and ecology, we have been attempting with some success to guide our own research by a conscious application of Marxist philosophy. (1976:35) Interestingly, none other than their "reductionist" col- league Wilson took issue with that claim, maintaining that it was "quite false" (interview with Wilson in 1981). According to Wilson, Levins and Lewontin's example is the theory of community ecology, which emphasizes the community matrix and species interactions. They assert that it "derives, in part, from a conscious application of a Marxist world view" (1976:35). This is identical, Wilson counters, with Levins's theory in Evolution in Changing Environments (1968), where community properties are derived from pairwise interactions in a very standard way. What on earth is Marxist about that? Wilson asked, and added that if that is Marxist, then he is more Marxist than Levins and Lewontin (Wilson admires Levins's book and endorsed it in Sociobiology). In my subsequent interview with Levins (in 1981), I Commitment to a reductionist methodology does not require commitment to a reductionist metaphysics asked him to reply to Wilson's challenge. He answered that it is the intent that is Marxist. This example indicates how difficult it is for even the most anti-reductionisti- cally minded to establish in practice a truly non-reduc- tionistic science. But how anti-reductionistically minded are the anti- reductionists? In the examination of the basic differen- ces in scientific world view we have particularly concentrated on anti-reductionists who have a Marxist- inspired epistemology. But as we have seen, the Marxist position seems to be some kind of extension of a more profound ontological commitment to the molecular level and to "true" causes.14 Thus, it comes as no surprise that scientists from such diverse fields as physics, chemistry, and molecular biology can be found in the same group of vocal critics of sociobiology. But it is high time to ask the question: Are not all these fields "reductionist" in the traditional sense? We are faced with the strange circumstance that reductionist scientists (in the traditional sense) are attacking "reductionism" (in their own newly defined sense). To underscore the point here, perhaps it would be useful to bring forth an example of "typical" traditional reductionist reasoning. For this I choose the biologist Peter Medawar. Medawar had little sympathy for either IQ research or sociobiological modeling of the Wilson type (Medawar, 1977,1981). In fact, he relegated both IQ research and sociobiology to the realm of "unnatural sciences" (sciences attempting to imitate "real" natural sciences, without the latter's rigor and methods). For Medawar, the problem with sociobiology was not that it was reductionist, but rather that it was not reductionist enough (interview with Medawar in 1981). Planters and Weeders If it is true that many critics of sociobiology, IQ research, and other purported "reductionist" sciences are in fact "traditional" reductionists themselves, this means also that they are "outsiders" to the field they criticize. Ob- viously, this situation creates a basis for misunderstand- ing the spirit of a text. For critics who are trained in chemistry, physics, or molecular biology (or reductionist fields within evolutionary biology), and who are used to close reading of texts for their exact meaning, it is under- standably hard to appreciate the "story telling" tradition Politics and the Life Sciences August 1992 207</page><page sequence="10">Reductionism, "Bad Science, " and Politics of much of evolutionary biology and the playful scenar- ios that some sociobiologists feel free to employ to es- tablish a logical point. Part of the critics' opposition to sociobiology and research in intelligence may thus sim- ply come from the fact that they do not share the assump- tions, reasoning style, or conventions of those fields (Segerstr?le, 1983, 1989, 1990a; see Segerstr?le, 1990b for a similar controversy). Another unifying characteristic of the critics is their unusual conception of the social role of the scientist. The critics tend to belong to a new minority group of "weeders" within the scientific community, working in direct opposition to the established majority of scientific "planters"?in fact, working to weed out what some of these planters plant (Segerstr?le, 1983,1990a). Planters are mainstream scientists with an unproblematic belief in the pursuit of knowledge and the integrity and poten- tial social usefulness of the products of scientific knowl- edge. This means that planters basically want to get on with their research. Weeders, on the other hand, believe that "bad" science must be identified and exposed before it can do social harm, which is in turn connected with their belief that bad science has bad consequences.15 Therefore, they see it as their mission to maintain a constant vigil for dangerous messages embedded in scientific texts, new or old. This is the way Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin characterized the situation: Critics of biological determinism are like members of a fire brigade, constantly being called out in the middle of the night to put out the latest conflagra- tion, always responding to immediate emergen- cies, but never with the leisure to draw up plans for a truly fireproof building. Now it is IQ and race, now criminal genes, now the biological inferiority of women, now the genetic fixity of human nature. All of these deterministic fires need to be doused with the cold water of reason before the entire neighborhood is in flames. Critics of determinism, then, seem to be doomed to constant nay-saying, while readers, audiences and students react with impatience to the perpetual negativity... . In the words of Lumsden and Wilson, defending their Genes, Mind, and Culture against those who accuse Weeders closely scrutinize texts for what they perceive as errors. The purpose is to infer maximally undesirable social implications from "errors" in the text it of extreme determinist reductionism, critics should "fish or cut bait." (1984:266)16 Obviously, the weeder's conception of the role of the scientist is hard for planters to understand or accept. Bernard Davis (1985), the most vehement defender of freedom of research in general, and of behavioral genetic and sociobiological research in particular, invented the word "neo-Lysenkoist" to describe the critics' approach. Davis is convinced that the criticism of sociobiology and IQ research is exclusively politically motivated, i.e., has nothing to do with a different conception of science. For him, there is only one possible attitude toward science (interestingly, he counts IQ research as a natural science). He cannot recognize the legitimacy of an alter- native conception of science or the role of the scientist (for a critical analysis of Davis, see Segerstr?le, 1987).17 To eliminate bad science, weeders closely scrutinize texts for what they perceive as errors, as Lewontin did with Jensen's work. But weeders tend to be even more dedicated, often undertaking a "moral reading" of the target of their criticism. The purpose of such a procedure is to infer maximally undesirable social implications from "errors" in the text. Here one could claim that weeders are simply in agreement with Gould's (1981) dictum that "debunking is a positive science." But mere debunking and error-finding does not seem to account for all activities of these ardent gardeners. There also appears to be some construction going on, whereby planters who are not saying what they "ought" to are helped along in various ways. To construe some- thing as "racist" is probably the strategy that will work best, in the sense that it will create the most moral outrage?and thereby also give maximal moral recogni- tion to the accuser. Not surprisingly, there have been scattered attempts among Wilson's critics to paint him as a racist (e.g., Rosenthal, 1977; Alper, 1982), although Lewontin has never directly accused Wilson of racism.18 However, it is also true that in the radical camp there was from the beginning the suspicion that Wilson's "multiplier effect" harbored racist ambitions, and Lums- den and Wilson's later joint effort in Genes, Mind, and Culture (1981a) may only have fueled these opinions (for a discussion, see Segerstr?le, 1986). In any case, it seems that in situations like these, mere facts can be of no relevance, e.g., the fact that Wilson in Sociobiology ap- provingly quoted Lewontin's (1972b) research and ex- plicitly supported the latter's opinion that race is not a useful concept in modern biology (Wilson, 1975a:550; for more attempts to "improve" Wilson, see Chorover, 1979; cf. Segerstr?le, 1983). Concern about potential abuse of knowledge may sometimes lead anti-reductionists to strange and para- doxical conclusions. For instance, in the area of behav- ioral genetics, anti-reductionists have proscribed research not only on group differences, but on individual 208 Politics and the Life Sciences August 1992</page><page sequence="11">Reductionism, "Bad Science," and Politics differences as well. Here their reasoning has led them to fear that (tentative) knowledge of individual genetic differences may be (incorrectly) used for racist argumen- tation about group genetic differences. But in this way they have missed the opportunity of effectively spreading the important, relatively new biological message that genetic variation within a population (race) is much greater than genetic variation between populations (races). Meanwhile, "racism" itself has been given a new meaning. It has been transformed to mean not a social belief in one race's superiority over another, but instead a scientific research interest in group differences in general, or as we saw above, even in individual differences (for a closer analysis, see Segerstr?le, 1986). Even more paradoxically, anti-reductionists some- times seem to unproblematically identify "good" science with either "modern" (reductionist?!) science19 or science that does not use models, formulas, or statistics but deals with the "real" (reductionist?!) molecular level instead. Indeed, according to Lewontin, "God is in the details" (1982:114). But here we see how shifting termi- nology may allow some critics of "reductionism" both to have their cake and eat it (for examples and closer anal- ysis of such paradoxes, see Segerstr?le, 1986). What, then, is the critics' supposed message for "re- ductionists"? Obviously, if practicing sociobiologists and researchers in human intelligence took the "anti- reductionist" conception of "good science" seriously, they might as well give up entirely. In practice, these scientists seem to just get on with their work. In doing so, they follow their conviction about how scientific pro- gress is actually made (Jensen 1969,1982; for Wilson's views, see Segerstr?le, 1986). But obviously "anti-reductionism" and "reduction- ism" are really terrible misnomers, since, as we have seen, the reasoning of supposed anti-reductionists is about as reductionist an attitude toward science as one can get. How can this contradiction be explained? The clue seems to lie in the redefinition of reductionism to mean biological determinism. This redefinition may have cre- ated a paradox in the following way: In the critics' view, scientists who are researching the biology of human behavior are also automatically biological determinista. Now, in sociobiological and behavioral genetic reason- ing, behavior is linked to the existence of hypothetical genes. In turn, these genes are, for heuristic reasons, treated in models and formulas as if they were "beans in a bag." Anti-reductionists now feel free to draw the conclusion that behind such a reductionist methodology must lie also a reductionist metaphysics : They believe that they have identified real ontological reductionists in the scientists involved with IQ testing, behavioral genetics, and sociobiology. This is why we have this confusing situation of the pot calling the kettle black. There is, of course, also another explanation: "reduc- tionism" may simply mean the attempt to reduce socio- cultural phenomena to biologically tractable ones. But while this interpretation is undoubtedly correct, it can- not be the whole explanation, since it cannot account for those critics who dislike modeling and statistics as such, even when the models have nothing to do with humans. So far, I have tried to challenge the claims of oppo- nents to sociobiology and IQ research in three ways. I have tried to show the contingent nature of the link between scientific and political conceptions of "heredi- tarians" and "environmentalists." I have further at- tempted to examine the differences in scientific world view and conception of the moral role of the scientist between purported reductionists and their critics, in order to show that there are deep-seated epistemological and, particularly, ontological differences between these two camps, and that therefore the opposition cannot be dismissed as simply political. Finally, I have tried to explain how it is possible for "anti-reductionists" to be arch-reductionists themselves, while nevertheless feel- ing free to attack their targets for reductionism. I hope to have clarified some issues for at least some readers. (Obviously, the "anti-reductionists" themselves have their minds made up and are not likely to be confused by objections like these). I will now once more turn to the attempt by leading "anti-reductionists" to demonstrate the necessary con- nection between science and politics, this time not only in "reductionist" thought, but also in their own "anti- reductionist" response. I will also once more challenge the assumption of such a connection?this time on pol- itical grounds. The Danger of Linking Science and Politics While initially interested in proving reductionists to be "bad" both scientifically and morally-politically, anti- reductionists have been evolving their own "good" com- bined anti-agenda, systematically connecting "correct" scientific concerns to "correct" political concerns. This means, for example, proposing an "emancipatory" science, or a "dialectical biology" that would be executed in the desirable epistemological-cum-political spirit. One attempt to construct an emancipatory science was an interdisciplinary symposium in Bressanone, Italy, in 1980, resulting in two volumes: Against Biological Deter- minism and Toward a Liberatory Biology (Rose, 1982a, 1982b; see Lewontin, 1983 for a positive review and Bateson, 1982, for a critical review). This is the rather tall order for an emancipatory science: The tasks of an emancipatory science are defined by the critique of contemporary bourgeois reduc- tionist science. It must overcome and transcend: 1) the subjectivity/objectivity split; and 2) the domi- Politics and the Life Sciences August 1992 209</page><page sequence="12">Reductionism, "Bad Science," and Politics nation of the natural and human worlds by in- strumental rationality. And it must achieve: 1) the democratization of science; and 2) a dialectical view of nature, including human nature, as neither static nor infinitely plastic; that is, a materialist view. (Rose and Rose, 1982:54) Later, there also emerged a deliberately Marxist alterna- tive to the reductionist program: Levins and Lewontin's The Dialectical Biologist (1985). This aimed at uniting dialectical and historical materialism in a way one up on Friedrich Engels's Dialectics of Nature. Here the anti-re- ductionists take the supposedly inherent connection be- tween reductionism and politics to new heights. In Levins and Lewontin's new approach, the evils of epistemology are no longer traced to the postulated political convictions of individual scientists, but instead to the general political ideology of the society that gave birth to modern science. According to the authors, the physical world view taken for granted by contemporary Western science in reality reflects basic conceptions of bourgeois society. In the bourgeois view, the individual was central as a social actor, and the actors were seen as social atoms colliding in the market. This is why in today's science the taken-for-granted world view is one in which "parts are separated from wholes and reified as things in themselves, causes separated from effects, sub- jects separated from objects" (1985:269-270). Levins and Lewontin have also found a political-historical explana- tion for why reductionists are fond of assuming stability and equilibrium as a natural state of a system: Legitimation of bourgeois society meant denial of the need for fundamental change, or even the possibility of it. Stability, balance, equilibrium and continuity became positive virtues in society and therefore also the objects of intellectual interest. (1985:275) The authors argue that a dialectical view of the world is more correct than an "alienated," reductionist view be- cause it focuses on wholeness, change, and interaction, which are true characteristics of the world. In fact, Levins and Lewontin are interested in no less than "the complex set of interacting causes of all events" and an understand- ing of objects in their full dimensionality (1985:221). But this quest is not only an epistemologica! one, represent- ing a kind of dialectical materialist philosophy; the auth- ors' surprising twist at this point is to bring in also a historical materialist perspective and link dialectical and historical materialism to each other. They are able to do this since, according to them, "the complex set of inter- acting causes of all events" applies especially to the domination by the capitalist system of all aspects of society, including science. It is interesting here to note that others who have For Levins and Lewontin there is no difference between their roles as scientists and political activists: doing "good science" (or weeding out "bad science") is at the same time a political activity diagnosed the ills of contemporary science and epis- temology, and traced their roots to bourgeois society (e.g., Marshall Berman, 1981), have been looking pri- marily for possible new scientific epistemologies, par- ticularly those that would allow us to transcend the Cartesian subject-object distinction, or bridge the gap between facts and values. Levins and Lewontin seem to suggest that getting rid of capitalism is a precondition for the development of a new science, or that it is the capi- talist system that is now preventing the true "dialectical" scientific epistemology from prevailing (1985:287). This also means that for Levins and Lewontin there is no difference between their roles as scientists and political activists: doing "good science" (or weeding out "bad science") is at the same time a political activity. But such a "total" approach is in fact quite unusual, even for Marxist academics. For a Marxist who is a scientist, it is in principle possible to adopt a variety of positions. For instance, one may be a political Marxist while a "tradi- tional" scientist. It is obviously not necessary to combine one's role as a scientist with one's role as a political activist. Thus, a political activist like Salvador Luria feels that he can be a Marxist politically while being a reduc- tionist scientifically (interview with Luria in 1981).20 And one may also be a Marxist politically and a dialecti- cal materialist philosophically, without attempting to connect these two ambitions to each other (Engels's own position, see Rogers, 1988:264). Levins and Lewontin's ambitions to develop a "total" Marxist world view did not mean that they abandoned their initial criticism of research in the biology of human behavior (in fact, The Dialectical Biologist and Not in Our Genes, representing these two approaches, more or less overlapped chronologically). Meanwhile, the critics of IQ research and sociobiology continued attacking their targets for the social consequences of their scientific claims, now also scanning the news for possible examples of political abuses. As it turned out, once the critics had launched the controversy about sociobiology, such abuses did indeed emerge. The critics saw this as major proof of the correctness of their analysis. On the other hand, one could argue that the critics themselves effec- tively notified the world's right-wing forces how they might use sociobiology to fit reactionary schemes. Per- 210 Politics and the Life Sciences Augitst 1992</page><page sequence="13">Reductionism, "Bad Science, " and Politics haps these right-wing forces would not even have dis- covered sociobiology without the help of the critics, and would just have stuck to their usual political repertoire (for documentation of cases of political abuse, see Beck- with, 1981-82). Steven Rose, "Britain's Lewontin," went so far as to write a letter to Nature (1981), in which he required certain named sociobiologists to actively distance them- selves from being quoted by right-wing groups, lest people believe that these scientists approved of such uses of their theories (see replies from Dawkins, 1981a; May- nard Smith, 1981; Wilson, 1981). Thus, Rose and others sought to place the burden of proof upon "reductionists" to prove their innocence. Sociobiologists have been under constant scrutiny by their ever-vigilant critics, and the latter have not minced words when condemning the former on political and scientific grounds. It is thus notable?and alarming?that when Dawkins had finally had enough of political accusations, and wrote a strongly worded review of Not in Our Genes (1985), Rose threat- ened to sue him for libel (Patrick Bateson and Richard Dawkins, personal communication). What was it that Dawkins said that so enraged Rose? Dawkins particularly took issue with the following state- ment in Not in Our Genes: Sociobiology is a reductionist, biological deter- minist explanation of human existence. Its adher- ents claim, first, that the details of present and past social arrangements are the inevitable manifesta- tions of the specific actions of genes. (Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin, 1984:236) To this Dawkins retorted: Rose et al. cannot substantiate their allegation about sociobiologists believing in inevitable genetic determination, because the allegation is a simple lie. The myth of the "inevitability" of genetic effects has nothing whatever to do with sociobiology, and has everything to do with Rose et aVs paranoie and demonological theology of science. (Dawkins, 1985:59, emphasis added) The most troubling assumption in anti-reductionist reasoning is probably that one can distinguish between "good" and "bad" science, and that it is "bad," not "good" science, that gets abused There is thus a certain imbalance: "politically correct" academics feel that they can require sociobiologists and others to be careful in their actions and choice of words, while they do not see the need to censor their own language when they accuse the former of political intent. The anti-reductionists are behaving as if there were al- ready an academic or social norm established whereby scientists must not only do research, but must also fore- see all possible political abuses of this research. Estab- lishing such a norm is an interesting prospect and might merit serious thought. At present, however, one can only say that the critics have been sanctioning a nonexistent norm. Still, the most troubling assumption in anti-reduc- tionist reasoning is probably that one can distinguish between "good" and "bad" science, and that it is "bad," not "good" science, that gets abused. This position is troubling because it also implies that it would be difficult to dismiss the results of "good" science, however dis- agreeable the potential consequences. Thus, in a society that uses scientific arguments to legitimize social policy decisions and ethical judgments, scientific "truth," how- ever objective, would not necessarily be socially benefi- cial. An obvious hypothetical example would be incontrovertible evidence about inherent race or sex differences. In fact, the implicit and awkward assumption in much of anti-reductionist reasoning that old and "bad" science lends itself to political abuse while mod- ern, "good" science does not, may be put to its most dramatic test by the Human Genome Project. It is interesting that few scientists, either among the "reductionists," i.e., active or implicit defenders of tradi- tional scientific values, or among the anti-reductionists within the radical left, have chosen an alternative course of action. They might have taken a public stance that science can have nothing to say about social justice, and that science cannot solve social problems.21 That they have not done so is perhaps natural, because as scientists both reductionists and anti-reductionists have a profes- sional interest in maintaining the prestige of science, and they may also have a genuine wish to contribute to human welfare. Or it may be that most practicing scien- tists are simply too busy doing science to reflect upon and publicly discuss the use and abuse of scientific re- sults. But this is obviously an important topic for public debate. At the very least, what should be rejected is the false opposition between "bourgeois reductionists" and their left-wing critics. The real problems lie elsewhere. The way anti-reductionists have defined the situation so far has probably done more political harm than good. If there really is a prevailing belief out there that "biology is destiny"?something the anti-reductionists seem to assume?then their tactics seem ideally suited for rein- forcing just such a belief. What the "innocent layman" and policy makers alike really need are lessons in con- temporary biology on such topics as gene-environment Politics and the Life Sciences August 1992 211</page><page sequence="14">Reductionism, "Bad Science, " and Politics interaction (as opposed to the scientifically unfounded idea of genetic determinism) and "populational think- ing" (as opposed to "typological thinking").22 And who is better suited for such an important mission than those academics who want to provide modern science for the people? A "round-up-the-usual-suspects" approach to research in the biology of human behavior seems like a losing strategy in the long run. Notes The following formulation seems to capture all these objec- tions simultaneously: "no theory which deals with highly struc- tured entities can be reduced to lower-level theories because these entities cannot be explained by these lower-level the- ories" (Poianyi, 1968, paraphrased in Hull, 1981). For further discussion on reductionism, particularly in biology, see Hull, 1981; Medawar and Medawar, 1983. As a methodological strategy in science in general, reductionism entails that "sys- tems at one level are analyzed into their component parts and the behavior of these higher level systems are explained in terms of properties, behaviors and arrangements of these parts" (Hull, 1974:4) Some of the most active members of the Sociobiology Study Group, later linked to Science for the People, beside Richard Lewontin, have been Joe Alper (chemistry), Jon Beckwith (molecular biology), and Robert Lange (physics). However, a study that makes just this point is Pastore (1949), who indeed reports a strong correlation between political preferences and scientific opinion on the hereditarian-environ- mentalist issue among his subjects, British and American scientists between 1900-1940. Thus, there may or may not be a systematic connection between political and scientific views for a particular group of scientists in a particular sociohistorical context?this is what needs to be assessed empirically in each case. This historical encounter happened in May 1976 during one of the meetings of the Sociobiology Study Group, where Noam Chomsky had been invited, and where I was present as an observer. There had been the hope in the group that Chomsky would agree to write a devastating critique of sociobiology and thus help the cause. Embarrassingly enough, in their discus- sion in front of the group, Chomsky and Lewontin discovered that while they both used Marx as an authority on human nature, one of them (Chomsky) quoted the "old" Marx and the other (Lewontin) the "young" Marx (the old Marx supposedly representing the idea of a species nature and the young Marx supposedly insisting on a socially changing human nature). What was worse, Chomsky thought it important for political radicals to postulate a relatively fixed human nature in order to be able to fight for a better society. Not surprisingly, under these conditions, no Chomsky critique came about. The proper judges of whether Wilson's views are "in fact" scientifically erroneous and old-fashioned are obviously not sociologists of science such as myself, but rather Wilson's fellow biologists. From my interviews with evolutionary bio- logists in 1981 and 1982, I was surprised to learn that the much-criticized Wilson in many respects represented surpris- ingly mainstream thinking in evolutionary biology. Thus, des- pite the (philosophical) merits of the anti-adaptationist and anti-reductionist positions of Wilson's main critics within evo- lutionary biology (Lewontin and Gould), their views cannot be taken as representative of the standard reasoning of practicing scientists. Declaring Wilson's views scientifically incorrect and outdated (in the first notorious Letter of the Sociobiology Study Group, Allen et al., 1975, and ever after) thus can be seen as simultaneously serving some leading critics' own interests in the competition for academic authority in the field of evolution- ary biology. Can philosophers of biology be of any help in adjudicating who is "right" and "wrong" scientifically, Wilson or his critics? Here there are also quite divergent opinions. Philip Kitcher (1985,1987) condemns sociobiology in general, while Alexan- der Rosenberg (1987) thinks that Kitcher is unfair and unreal- istically demanding in his expectations about what constitutes "good science" in this general field. Michael Ruse (1978,1985) sorts out many major issues, with growing sympathy for socio- biology. 6. The obvious further question of why he wanted to develop exactly these formulas can be answered by referring to Wil- son's moral-cum-scientific agenda, discussed in detail in Segerstr?le, 1986. 7. I am deliberately focusing on Lewontin's reasoning and its development in this article, since he has been a leading force and the scientific expert behind many of the collective papers against sociobiology and biological determinism. As a demo- crat and anti-elitist, he does not like to admit his leading role, as was obvious in my interviews with him. 8. This seems to be part of a common tendency of scientists to attribute the "errors" of others to extrascientific factors (see Segerstr?le, 1983, 1990a, for detailed discussion). 9. It is interesting to note that for Lewontin, as for most other critics of biological determinism, it is not enough to demon- strate that ideological bias leads to scientific error. There is a moral issue involved as well. Thus, the issue is not simply that the sociopolitical bias of a scientist may have an unconscious effect on the results. This is, arguably, what Gould is saying in his The Mismeasure of Man (1981)?at least Lewontin seems to think so, because he begs to differ from Gould in his review of the latter's book: "Like Kamin, I am, myself rather more harsh in my view. Scientists, like others, sometimes tell deliber- ate lies because they believe that small lies can serve big truths" (Lewontin, 1981b). 10. This agenda is one of the things that makes Wilson very different from most of his fellow sociobiologists, particularly Dawkins, with whom he is often compared. 11. Layzer seems to ignore the history of his own science, physics, which proceeded by theories and model building when ex- perimental methods were not strong enough to show the "underlying reality." For example, theories of electricity were developed before electrons were discovered. Layzer thus ap- pears to be operating from a perspective of contemporary physics. In this "neo-whiggish" approach, he is similar to many other critics of IQ research and sociobiology, particularly Le- wontin (see Note 19). 12. Again, I am myself not in the position to judge the extent, nature, and significance of such errors (or "errors"). In general, critics have searched for and found different types and sizes of errors, while sympathizers have been less motivated to find errors and more willing to downplay the size and significance of purported errors. For criticisms of Jensen's IQ research, see particularly Kamin (1974) and Block and Dworkin (1976). For an update on the status of Jensen's initial claims in 1969, see Jensen (1985) and the associated peer commentaries. For the situation regarding sociobiology, see Note 5 above. 13. Among left-wing academics, much has been made of the fraudulent twin studies of "the father of IQ testing," Sir Cyril Burt. There has been a tendency to undermine the credibility of the whole field of IQ research because of Burt. The problem with such a maneuver, however, is that presumably Burt in- vented his twin data exactly because of heavy competition for twins among IQ researchers at the time ?Burt was by no means the only one collecting twin data. According to an overview of the situation after the Burt scandal in Nature, these other researchers had obtained values similar to those of Burt, and thus his fraud as such does not seem to undermine the field (Thoday, 1981). (Obviously, this does not mean that one cannot dismiss the approach championed by Burt and others on other grounds, as Gould does, maintaining that "the real error" of Burt was his "reification" of IQ ?Gould, 1981). 14. Maynard Smith (1986) suggests that Lewontin became a Marx- ist too late for a Marxist philosophical perspective to have really been able to influence his scientific thinking, but maintainsthat Levins's work does seem informed by Marxism. 15. I have examined the weeder phenomenon more closely in 212 Politics and the Life Sciences August 1992</page><page sequence="15">Reductionism, "Bad Science, " and Politics Segerstr?le (1990d), including current attempts by "fraud scouts" to weed out error and fraud in science. 16. This refers to Lumsden and Wilson's (1981b) response to Lewontin's (1981a) critique of Genes, Mind, and Culture. 17. Meanwhile, those labeled "reductionists" can reap some bene- fits from this general situation. Their audience is those who have a traditional view of science and scientific authority. These planters, in fact, have an easy match: They can simply uphold a traditional image of unproblematic objective science against the threat by left-wing ideologues. But by dismissing critics as politically motivated, traditionalist scientists may also dismiss serious scientific criticism as ideological. 18. This is the way Lewontin himself formulated the issue in the Harvard Crimson, December 3, 1975: "Sociobiology is not a racist doctrine, but any kind of genetic determinism can and does feed on other kinds, including the belief that some races are superior to others." 19. A good example here is Lewontin, who, after attacking "the American academics" for "untrue statements, facts which are not facts, logic which is not logic, to prove that there are important genetic differences between races," continued: Yet everything that modern genetics tells us, the kind of genetics that goes on in our lab, for example, tells us...that most of the genetic variation that occurs in the human species.. .is between individuals in any group and rather little is between groups. (Lewontin, 1975b, em- phasis added) 20. It is interesting to note that not all left-wing activists in the Boston area saw it necessary or even useful to get involved in the sociobiology controversy. Salvador Luria, a molecular bi- ologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, won- dered why the critics were wasting so much time and energy on a detailed criticism of Wilson. According to him, sociobio- logy was not even a "good" political issue, in the sense that it could not be used for political mobilization of people in society at large (Luria, interview, 1981). Others, like George Wald, a Harvard University biologist, thought that there were much more important things for academics to deal with, such as the nuclear threat, and that sociobiology was a waste of time (Wald, interview, 1981). We already saw how Chomsky, the M.I.T. linguist, could not be persuaded to join the anti-Wilson campaign, largely because he could not see anything wrong with the idea of searching for a general human nature (Chom- sky, interview, 1981). 21. An exception here is Bernard Davis (1978), who has briefly but explicitly brought up this point. For an unusually negative stance on scientists as social problem solvers, see Luria (1974). 22. This point was made in popular writings, particularly by Theo- dosius Dobzhansky (e.g., 1968) and was later made repeatedly by others (e.g., Bernard Davis, 1985). Meanwhile, such thinking does not yet seem to have become part of our common stock of knowledge. The reason the left does not seem willing to make the most of this seemingly "anti-racist" point (and even though -or perhaps just because? ? Dobzhansky was Lewon- tin's teacher) is probably that an emphasis on individual vari- ation, as against typological thinking, necessarily will have to emphasize genetic differences between individuals?some- thing that Dobzhansky did not shy away from, but the present critics do. Dobzhansky used a biological argument to support the traditional American ideology of individual liberalism: A class or caste society leads unavoidably to misplace- ment of talents. The biological justification of equality of opportunity is that a society should minimize the loss of valuable human resources, as well as the personal misery resulting from misplaced abilities, and thus en- hance its total adaptiveness to variable environments.
