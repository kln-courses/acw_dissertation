<plain_text><page sequence="1">Articles The Erotics of Negative Theology: Maimonides on Apprehension Peter Eli Gordon* "A pompous volume, nearly forty books, red lining, brown leather, gold binding ..."1 Thus began Franz Rosenzweig's review of the Encyclopaedia Judaica, which had just appeared in Germany at the beginning of this century. "No one need be frightened by the Latin title" he continued, "the work is not in the Latin tongue, but is rendered in good, readable, large and legibly printed German ..." Those acquainted with Rosenzweig's Kleinere Schriften will find his remarks familiar in their irreverence, and will recall that some of his most original comments are to be found in these essays. As the Encyclopaedia Judaica was issued volume by volume and in alphabetical order, Rosenzweig begins with entries under the letter A'. Rosenzweig admits, grudgingly perhaps, that a great part of its contents are "unobjectionable." He then proceeds to quote at length a portion of the encyclopedia's treatment of anthropomorphism, a small extract which addresses the "psychological foundations" of anthropomorphism, and which, he writes, "deserves some reflection" because it remains "the dominant interpretation." The passage reads as follows: anthropomorphism ... is primarily due to the limitedness of human thought, which is able to grasp the concept of pure Spirit only in an indirect fashion, and only when aided by sensible, pictoral representations. Indeed, * This paper was originally written for a seminar in Medieval Jewish Thought conducted during the spring of 1993 under the direction of Professor Amos Funkenstein at the University of California at Berkeley.

It is therefore understandable that even a progressive religious consciousness would be inclined to endow God with the noblest and, as far as possible, . . . spiritualized attributes of the human personality. In this sense the following well-known biblical phrase is appropriate when inverted, and is applicable not only to primitive and heathen religious systems: that is, "man created God after his (man's) own image." The encyclopedia's style has not aged well - it is a lumbering, academic German of eighty years ago - but its intentions are quite modern. The encyclopedia's dictum ironically inverts a biblical phrase (Genesis 1:26- 27), according to which God created man "in his image and likeness" (be- tselem Elohim u-bi-dmuto), a formula that spawned its own interpretative history, its own proponents and apologists. But the encycopaedia's upside- down response is a slap in the face to the traditional theological interpretation. Not only the "heathen" (who is already an invention of his monotheist opponents) is guilty of anthropomorphism, but the monotheist as well. The most enlightened man creates his deity after his own image and likeness, no differently from the heathen who carves a human face on his fetish. Rosenzweig found such an interpretation intolerable. It turned the dominant nineteenth century value of spiritualized, ethical Judaism against itself. The hallmark of Judaism, according to its modern apologists (Heinrich Graetz, Hermann Cohen, among others) was supposed to lie in its utterly spiritualized concept of divinity. Following Kant and the tradition of post-Kantian German philosophy, figurative religion was thought to rest on a flawed dialectic of reason. The true Idea of God lay beyond all possible sense experience and as a matter of course lacked spatial characteristics. The writers of the encyclopedia, however, had taken such strategies of purgation and spiritualization one step further, concluding, with Feuerbach, that all theology is a forgotten apotheosis; that there is nothing beyond mundane experience that we did not foolishly put there ourselves.2 Rosenzweig understood this danger. What provoked him in the encyclopaedia's scornful rejection of anthropomorphism was his sense 2 See Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity for the classic statement of this position; of course, the argument was later transposed by Freud in The Future of an Illusion into a more psychological key, but the thesis of projection is essentially the same.

His outrage is worth reproducing at length: Thus one handles a theological problem nowadays! - 'Inadequacy of speech', 'Limitedness of human thought' finally as a clue to the 'God' formed in the image of man! Even conceding the correctness of this 'epistemological' deficiency (and I simply do not understand to what language, to what thought and to which experience we can compare our language, our thought, and our experience), it must yet be admitted: In what science is it allowed to substitute 'epistemological' lamentations for productive efforts ...? Rosenzweig's response is immediately classifiable. It belongs to the upstart trend in philosophy that arose with Kierkegaard's polemic against an Hegelian Aufhebung of religion, and that flourished at the beginning of the twentieth century. Existentialism (or phenomenology in its Heidegger- ian sense) grasped for a root experience deeper than the sort that leads to propositional knowledge; it desired a knowledge that was not scientific but interested and libidinal. Like Heidegger, Rosenzweig resisted the efforts by science to colonize human experience, its reduction of knowledge to the merely ontic (the knowledge of objects) and the neglect of ontology (the elusive conditions for being). Rosenzweig and Heidegger were dissimilar in spirit - where Rosenzweig spoke of God, Heidegger would speak of Being - but they were together in their palpable dislike for the Apollonian, contemplative spirit of Kantian and neo-Kantian epistemology (the latter represented by Rosenzweig's teacher Hermann Cohen) which Heidegger disdainfully described in Sein und Zeit as "die So-genannte Erkenntnistheorie. "3 Properly to understand Rosenzweig's hostility demands turning back to the most sophisticated and enduring source of anti-anthropomorphism in Jewish culture, the source that nurtured and, by giving them a reference point in Jewish tradition, helped make respectable the rationalist projects of modern German Jewish thought from Mendelssohn to Cohen. That this project still survives in Judaism has much to do with the inspiration provided by the medieval Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides (1 135- 1204), whose hostility to anthropomorphism remains startling in its vigor. In the well-known discussion between R. Akiba and R. Ishmael, we read that the Bible is not to be taken prima facie, but is rather to be interpreted according to the principle that "the Torah speaks the language of the people." This was originally an exegetical principle with a primarily 3 Sein und Zeit. Introduction. Also see the fruitful comparison by Karl Lowith, "M. Heidegger and F. Rosenzweig: A Postscript to Being and Time" in Nature, History, and Existentialism, and Other Essays in the Philosophy of History.

Especially passages that purport to describe God in physical terms are equivocal; they have an external (figurative) and internal (philosophical) sense. Their external sense accepts imaginative language as literal, erroneously ascribing worldly predicates to God. In this sense the Torah is written in "the language of people," that is, in the figurative medium grasped by unschooled minds. The internal and philosophical sense of such passages, however, avoids the error of literalism; it does away with all figurative terminology and all positive predication entirely. For Maimo- nides, describing God at all leads to error, since all human language has as its proper realm of reference the world of experience, not things divine. Maimonides was therefore compelled to find philosophical import to biblical phrase according to which God created man "in his image and likeness," since this could not mean that God has a human body, despite the common locutions such as "he found favor in God's eyes" (matsah chen be-'aino) or the story of Moses's encounter with God where he gazes on the back of his head. Maimonides' much celebrated solution to such problems is the via negativa, the way of negative theology. Maimonides' primary purpose is to ensure God's utter transcendence, his singularity and his otherness to the world. It is as a consequence of his Aristotelian framework that God's transcendence can only be confirmed only if God's attributes are rejected. But the rejection of God's attributes, as is well- known, proceeds much further than the rejection of the robustly human descriptives such as "hand", "eye", or "foot." Maimonides can only guarantee God's unity and uniqueness by purging language about God of all positive predication. The purging is so thorough and so compelling in its argumentation that many commentators, following Rosenzweig, have been forced to conclude that nothing is left, that Maimonides' strictly negative theology results in a negation of religion. Rosenzweig bore only the most grudging respect for Maimonides. He admitted that Maimonides might provide an antidote to the "grotesque errors of the early Kabbalah," which labored "to calculate and measure out God's 'form'." Where the early Kabbalah indulged in a "genuine, 4 See the discussion of Moshe Halbertal and Avishai Margalit in their study Idolatry. Translated from the Hebrew. (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1992), especially p. 54ff.</page><page sequence="5">(1995) The Erotics of Negative Theology 5 image-making anthropomorphism" Rosenzweig considered Maimonides as an equally radical countermeasure: "The Jewish philosophy of religion of the middle ages," he writes, "reached its zenith in [his] efforts ... successfully to codify as dogma (so far as this is possible within Judaism) the 'incorporeality' of God."5 It is Maimonides' "dogmatic" hostility to anthropomorphism, more than any other, that Rosenzweig wished to combat. Of all sustained, systematic efforts to banish God's body from Judaism, Maimonides' dense and difficult Moreh Ha-Nebukhim is rightly the best known. His very method and tone seem to exemplify the spirit of rationalism in Judaism. At first glance he is the model of restraint; his cool, Hellenistic gaze is the prototype for a Kantian critique of religion (indeed, some of the most original and painstaking writing on Maimonides was that of the neo- Kantian Hermann Cohen). Most of all, what sets Rosenzweig and Maimonides apart is Maimonides' apparent belief that theology is a matter of philosophical contemplation rather than religious experience. For Rosenzweig, this is the result of a confusion in Maimonides between two stances, one distanced and scientific, the other engaged and personal. Rosenzweig believed that religious experience has a claim on anthro- pomorphism that the stubborn epistemologist - who is interested in an ostensibly objective knowledge - cannot comprehend: "Would a biolo- gist," Rosenzweig asks, "feel dissociated from the fertile plain of experience - as Kant himself would say - simply because of the obvious difficulty in finding an unequivocal boundary to distinguish the animate from the inanimate, or would a psychologist, simply because of the questionableness of all self-consciousness?" Rosenzweig fervantly rejects Maimonides just as he rejects Kant, because their insistence on the "limitedness of human thought," (invoking Kant's Grenzen der reinen Vernunft) seems to him beside the point when discussing the emotional dimension of religion: "It is believed one can settle a theological problem by neglecting experience, with a pair of general quips about our human weaknesses and a closing declaration - which in fact quite glaringly contradicts the previous one - of the human all-powerfulness that lends even to God himself his form."6 Without apologies, Rosenzweig insisted that any religious experience must of necessity resort to anthropomorphism. Whenever the human mind tries to grasp the divine and come into some kind of contact with it, the experience will be inevitably of a God who is shaped after our needs. 5 Kleinere Schriften, "Zur Encyclopaedia Judaica" Op cit. p. 733-6. ° Ibid.</page><page sequence="6">6 Peter Eli Gordon JSQ 2 Rosenzweig writes that "theological experiences, so long as they are genuine experiences and not mere flights of illusion, share a common feature as experiences of encounters, not experiences of a subject-object sort, like world experiences." The attempt to describe God as one would describe the objects of the world is the mistake of the epistemologist, for whom all reality is like a thing. But if there is theological experience at all then God must be experienced according to human capacities, and since people are bound to the mundane world, God's relationship to people can only be understood in mundane language. "If one wishes to remain within the sphere of experience, one must speak neither of God nor of people, but rather of the happening between the two. And exactly here the Bible provides the best introduction. . . . The 'Anthropomorphisms' of the Bible are throughout utterances concerning the God-and-human encounter."7 According to Rosenzweig, anthropomorphism comes about because a God of infinite capacities makes small gestures of accomodation: If we speak to God, God has ears, and if God wishes to speak to us, God has a mouth. And,"where a people seeks to please Him with a burnt offering and undertakes to do so in an earnest spirit, here God will not be so lacking in good humor as to refuse to smell."8 When we reject anthropomorphism, we grow accostumed to speaking of God in the most minimal terms - God is all-powerful, all-knowing, infinitely just and infinitely good. But these are in another sense maximal terms because they are superlatives. According to Rosenzweig, such language involves a hybris far worse than anthropomorphism, since the human mind cannot grasp the infinite. Thus Rosenzweig objects: "What do I know of this all ? What I have experienced and experience is ... powerfulness, knowing, goodness - each of them in its own limited measure and in mine." A God who can be experienced has to be encountered in human terms, just because as humans we crave and cannot do without a God of more human dimensions, and God is cognizant of human needs. "God," writes Rosenzweig, "speaks all spoken tongues."9 I must put Rosenzweig's concerns aside for the moment. I have dwelled on his polemic only to illustrate what I believe remains a common misunderstanding in the study of Maimonides' philosophy, and perhaps a common misunderstanding of anthropomorphism. It is of course true that Maimonides combatted anthropomorophism, but it is not true that therefore his philosophy is without an experiential component. There is 7 Ibid. 8 Ibid. pp. 738-9. y Ibid.</page><page sequence="7">(1995) The Erotics of Negative Theology 7 an all too common view of Maimonides according to which his rationalism obviates religious experience. And for being so venomously hostile to figurative religion he is seen, unjustifiably I think, as something of a bore. Indeed, if he has been the subject of caricature, this has much to do with the rise in stock of Maimonides' Kabbalistic opposition, whose colorful language, brazen anthropomorphism, and unabashedly ecstatic version of religion attracts modern and post-modern sensibilities and squares better with our privatized, emotional, and (usually) non- philosophical postures. In this paper I hope somewhat to rectify the caricature by calling attention to an erotic dimension in Maimonides' philosophy. Since this way of speaking is potentially hazardous, a preliminary clarification is in order. When I speak about the erotic I do not mean to say that Maimonides was obsessed with, or even overly concerned with sexual matters; sex plays a small though not insignificant role in his works. A distinction must be made between eros and sexuality. Sex is what goes on physically between people; while sexuality might be, as a recent book puts it, "the way a culture imagines sex."10 Eros, however, is more expansive, implying a symbolic that pervades every sphere of life, the libidinal stuff out of which culture itself is formed. This, at least, is the rich and fluid role assigned to Eros in Freud's later, more speculative writings. The crucial distinction between eros and sexuality is that eros is not limited to bodies. It has as much to do with feeling as with physicality, and, as in Plato's Symposium, it implies ecstasy without necessarily implying corporeal unity. On might argue that this is Rosenzweig's error. He assumes that any human experience of God must anthropomorphize God, knowing no other route to intimacy than the intimacy modeled after human relationships. But Maimonides' aim was precisely to delimit the usual paths of human cognition, opening a space for a radically unique experience of God that was not modeled on sensible experience. In this project Maimonides resorts to erotic illustrations that remain, para- doxically perhaps, an eroticism without sexuality. 1 1 10 David Biale, Eros and the Jews: From Biblical Israel to Contemporary America. (New York: Basic Books, 1992), p. 7. 1 1 Here it is relevant to note the current vogue in Jewish studies for subjects relating to sexuality and the body, which has produced some remarkably imaginative and provocative work, inter alia, David Biale's Eros and the Jews: From Biblical Israel to Contemporary America. It might be argued that Biale's book bears a title more ambitious than the actual scope of the study The book delivers a fascinating look at Jewish sexuality, but the notion of eros found in the title might be given an even more far- reaching interpretation. In restricting his study to discourses relating to sexual activity Biale ends by confirming a common view of what role Hellenism played in Judaism - that</page><page sequence="8">8 Peter Eli Gordon JSQ 2 Erotic imagery plays a central role in Maimonides' account of religious knowledge. Religious feeling, perhaps especially when its modes of verbal expression are restricted to a highly precise philosophical vocabulary, begins to flow towards other shores; its vehicles of expression are no longer primarily those of logos. Recognizing this fact implies nothing scandalous and nothing novel, since the erotic nature of the relationship between God and the Jews is built in to the biblical text; its puns confusing sexual knowledge with cognition (lada'at), the (at once erotic and religious) imagery of Shir H a- Shir im, the metaphors of God and Israel as husband and bride. In Maimonides' thought such eroticism has been in great measure neglected because of the overwhelming rationalist structure in which it is embedded. One of the greatest twentieth century scholars of Jewish religious philosophy, Jacob Guttmann, has called attention to the role of amor dei in Maimonides' writings. According to Guttmann, the entire edifice of the Guide aims at helping the philosopher to arrive at a blissful communion with God, a state which is accompanied by love and actualizes the immortality of the soul. And most recently Shlomo Pines has provocatively hinted at the "intellectual ecstasy" that Maimonides "may have had in mind" when describing the "death by a kiss" that is the end of philosophical speculation.12 Pines does not develop his interpreta- tion further than to suggest that the Guide is "impregnated with some mystical elements" borrowed perhaps from Islamic mysticism. He has been, I think, the sole commentator to notice that in Maimonides' thought, as in Sufism, the Greek notion of Eros plays no small role.13 Of course, it is possible to dismiss such talk as mere metaphor. But even it brought with it a strain of asceticism, a strong ambivalence towards the body and towards sexuality. Not surprisingly, Biale reads Maimonides as the exemplar of this Hellenistic spirit. By contrast, the Kabbalah seems for Biale as for many other writers (Scholem, Idei) far more positive in its attitudes towards sexuality. With all of this I have little quarrel and even less competency to judge. But I think Biale's treatment underscores how Maimonides' philosophy labours under a mischaracterization. For a brilliant introduction and critical engagement with Biale and other recent works on the body and sexuality in Jewish culture, see Naomi Seidman's review in the Journal of Jewish Social Studies, Number One, Volume One (forthcoming). This paper owes a number of its insights to long lunchtime discussions with Seidman, and her review is also in part a product of the same discussions. I am deeply grateful for these talks. Of advice I am certain I got the better deal, if not the better lunch. The erotic metaphors are most overt at Part three, chapter 51. A considerable portion of this paper will be devoted to exploring the philosophical meaning of such language. Also see the suggestive comments of Julius Guttmann, Philosophies of Judaism.

The experiential dimension in Maimonides has been neglected, I think, in large part because it is assumed that his assault on anthropomorophism is an assault on religious experience. By contrast, I want to argue that in fact his attack on all figurative language is meant as a preliminary step in a process of philosophical education. Maimonides lays down a theory for the narrow achievements of human cognition that eventually opens out onto the wide plains of religious experience. In what follows, I want to pursue Maimonides in some of the more technical aspects of his argumentation in the Moreh Ha-Nebukhim, with the express aim of addressing the worry that the God of Maimonides is no God at all, or, more precisely, that the God that results is so rarefied as to be of no consequence to religious experience.14 Much of the ensuing discussion travels through territory quite familiar to those acquainted with the Guide. Indeed, this is necessarily so, since Maimonides weaves arguments that are relentlessly deductive and accumulative in structure, and to isolate one paragraph distorts his larger purposes. What emerges in the following pages is an irreducible element of experience at the core of Maimonides' negative theology. While purging from theology any actual knowledge of God, he affirms that philosophers who follow the proper path may attain greater proximity to God. This involves spatial metaphor, which would seem to contradict Maimonides' greater effort to reject speaking about God in figurative terms. Following the general rule laid down by Maimonides that all terminology which is applied both to the world of experience and to God is equivocal, proximity to God will emerge as a discursively empty but religiously rich feature of Maimonides' negative theology. The notion of proximity, I will argue, is the imaginative, figurative term for the final goal of the religious philosopher: hasagath Elohim, the apprehension of God. There is an important distinction to be made between apprehension of God and knowledge of God: the former is possible, the latter is not. In the final analysis, apprehension is not a mere cognitive state.15 Rather, it is characterized as a theophany, employing the 14 For an overview and defense of negative theology, see Isaac Franck, "Maimonides and Aquinas on Man's Knowledge of God: A Twentieth-Century Perspective" in The Review of Metaphysics. 38 (1985), pp. 591-615. And for complaints against negative theology see, for example, Fred Sommers, "What We Can Say About God" in Judaism 1 5 (1966), pp. 61-73. I should note here that the theme of knowledge in Maimonides' writings has received less attention than it deserves, despite its centrality. For a similar complaint, see Norman Roth, "Knowledge of God and God's Knowledge: Two Epistemological Problems in Maimonides" in Maimonides: Essays and Texts. (Madison: Hispanic</page><page sequence="10">10 Peter Eli Gordon JSQ 2 familiar metaphors of Israel and God as erotic partners where idolatry is an adulterous betrayal ofthat relationship.16 Finally, I will suggest that if my reading of the Maimonidean idea of proximity and apprehension is correct, then the religious experience Rosenzweig demanded is perhaps not entirely foreign to Maimonides' negative theology. Indeed, this is a dramatic consequence, since it would suggest that there are libidinal, even existential qualities in Maimonides' thought, a Jewish religious philoso- phy generally noted for its sobriety and its Hellenistic cast. Part I: Matter, the Married Harlot. In his introduction to the Moreh Ha-Nebukhim, Maimonides extracts the following parable from Proverbs, 7:6-21: For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice; And I beheld among the thoughtless ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding, Passing through the street near her corner, And he went the way to her house; In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the blackness of night and the darkness. And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart. She is riotous and rebellious, and so on. Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, and so on. So she caught him, and so on. Sacrifices of peace-offerings were due from me, and so on. Therefore came I forth to meet thee, and so on. Come let us take our fill of love, and so on. For my husband is not at home, and so on. The bag of money, and so on. With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield. With the blandishment of her lips she enticeth him away. Seminary, 1985). Roth's essay touches on the precise meanings of apprehension, but with an entirely different purpose in mind. The most convincing of the recent literatures on Maimonides' distinction between knowledge and apprehension is Michael Blaustein, "Aspects of Ibn Bajja's Theory of Apprehension" in Maimonides and Philosophy. Op cit. pp. 202-212. Apprehension can be read as a generic term for which knowledge is a specific type. Aristotelian cognition as a type of assimilation theory (the subject acquiring the form of the object, thus becoming like the object) was adopted by Maimonides, but it is obvious that the apprehension of God cannot achieve full assimilation, given the absolute dissimilarity between the subject and the object. I believe that given this problem Maimonides wants to insist that apprehension of God does not achieve full knowledge but something like knowledge. It is not knowledge because knowledge would demand the unity of the intellect with the object. Maimonides keeps to the generic term apprehension and tends to avoid the specific term knowledge for exactly this reason. Notice that according to the assimilation theory, apprehension or "grasping" (the Arabic nominative is idrak, the verb is idraka, literally, "to grasp") involves a gesture of drawing near and drawing away, metaphors with a profound theophanic purport. 16 This should not be taken to mean a full unity of the subject and object of intellection, as Shlomo Pines has so decisively shown. See Pines, "The Limitations of Human Knowledge according to Al Farabi, ibn Bajja and Maimonides" in Studies in Medieval Jewish History and Literature. (Cambridge, Mass., 1979).</page><page sequence="11">(1995) The Erotics of Negative Theology 11 Maimonides explains that, as a rule, parables of this type should not be interpreted as if every individual term had a precise meaning, since all of the details "only figure in the consistent development of the parable's external meaning, the circumstances described in it being of a kind typical for adulterers." Maimonides omits many of the details, and he extracts from this parable a general observation. He sees in it "a warning against the pursuit of bodily pleasures and desires." This interpretation, which itself abstracts from the specific sexual scenario, is followed with a much more striking abstraction: Accordingly he [Solomon] likens matter, which is the cause of all these bodily pleasures, to a harlot who is also a married woman. In fact his entire book is based on this allegory. And we shall explain in various chapters of this Treatise his wisdom in likening matter to a married harlot, and we shall explain how he concluded this book of his with a eulogy of the woman who is not a harlot but confines herself to attending to the welfare of her household and husband. For all the hindrances keeping man from his ultimate perfection, every deficiency affecting him and every disobedience, come to him from his matter alone [mitsad hakhomer shelo lvad' as we shall explain in this Treatise [emphasis in original].17 The terms and evaluations of Maimonides' interpretation are common: Woman is physicality itself, tempting man from spiritual concerns, while religious fidelity to God demands from men that they resist mundane involvements and material distractions. Such claims are anchored in oppositions - male-female, spirit-body, sacred-profane - that have played a central (by no means neutral) role in the foundations of culture. Maimonides, however, employs them in an original fashion. Within an Aristotelian framework, the term "matter" [khomer] has a definite philosophical meaning which opposes it to form, as well as a procreative meaning according to which in reproduction the male contributes form and the woman contributes the passive matter upon which the form is impressed.18 Maimonides exploits this sexual and philosophical vocabu- lary. As will become obvious, he makes the binarism of form-matter resonate with the sexual binarism male-female. Finally, he promises that the Guide to the Perplexed itself will explain why matter is the sole impediment to man's perfection - a quite elaborate promise. 17 Moreh Na-Nebukhim.

In the first, he merely quotes the biblical text and explains that it is a tale about adultery, that is, the story of a "married harlot." This level of the text, Maimonides tells us, is overt, and it involves a host of irrelevant details, some of which he even omits (the repeated phrase "and so on" seems a palpable mark of his annoyance at mere storytelling). At the second stratum of interpretation, Maimonides suggests that the passage has a general, reduced and homiletic meaning, that "man should not follow his bestial nature" and that "all the hindrances keeping man from his ultimate perfection . . . come from his matter alone." Of these first two interpretative strata Maimonides prefers the second. He cautions us that "in some chapters of this Treatise I have explained the meaning of a parable and have drawn your attention to the general proposition signified by it ... you should not inquire into all the details occurring in the parable, nor should you wish to find significations corresponding to them. . . . The assumption of such an obligation would result in extravagant fantasies. . . . Your purpose, rather, should always be to know, regarding most parables, the whole that was intended to be known." To fortify the distinction between the irrelevant and the essential meanings, Maimonides suggests a simile of obstruction: "My remarking that it is a parable will be like someone's removing a screen from between the eye and the thing."19 Finally, once Maimonides has isolated the general meaning of the parable, we find that his interpretation hints at a deeper philosophical sense to the term khomer. On Maimonides' account, these two strata - the overt as against the homiletic or philosophical - advance in stages towards greater textual understanding. The movement from one stratum to the next entails an intellectual progression, rejecting inaccurate metaphor in favor of a philosophically precise vocabulary. While a modern reader of Maimonides need not adopt this general principle, we must be certain that we grasp Maimonides' reasons for doing so. Most importantly, we must understand that the rule he has laid down for the interpretation of parables turns out to be a specific case for the general project: it is a principle in miniature for the larger task of the Guide. The general claim will be that biblical language is equivocal; it possesses an external or metaphorical and an internal or philosophical sense, and grasping the deeper meaning is "like someone's removing a screen between the eye and the thing." Since the overall aim is to arrive at a philosophical understanding of divine 19 MN. p. 14. And elsewhere, for example: "Matter is the strong veil preventing the apprehension of what is separate from matter as it truly is." MN. p. 138.</page><page sequence="13">(1995) The Erotics of Negative Theology 13 predication, this means that the task of the Guide is likened to the removal of a screen between the philosopher's eye and God. Now, we should recall that Maimonides promises the philosopher to "guide him in his perplexity until he becomes perfect and finds rest."20 It is a basic assumption of the Guide that perfection is first and foremost achieved through philosophy: Do you not see the following fact? God, may His mention be exalted, wished us to be perfected and the state of our societies to be improved by His laws regarding actions. Now this can come about only after the adoption of intellectual beliefs, the first of which being His apprehension, may He be exalted, according to our capacity. This, in its turn, cannot come about except through divine science, and this divine science cannot become actual except after the study of natural science [my emphasis].21 Perfection, for Maimonides, is above all perfection of the intellect. A precondition for this perfection is a correct apprehension of God facilitated by rigorous training in the sciences. As Julius Guttmann observed, Maimonides in this crucial respect belonged to the tradition of Aristotle in which the perfection and happiness - eudaemonia - that should be the highest aim of man are achieved through philosophical contemplation.22 Thus we can say that the Guide aims at the perfection of the philosopher by helping him to arrive at a correct apprehension of God, and this is accomplished, as we have seen above, through the removal of external meaning, the "screen" of metaphor. This interpretation of Maimonides' general aim, however, is insuffi- cient. He himself has affirmed that "all the hindrances keeping man from his ultimate perfection, every deficiency affecting him and every disobedience, come to him from his matter alone." For the philosopher, then, the screen which needs to be removed must have something to do with his matter. As we have already seen, the philosopher achieves perfection when he overcomes his perplexity, and his perplexity arises from a failure to liberate the internal sense of the biblical text from its metaphorical husk.23 The puzzle we must confront, then, is the nature of the relationship between matter and metaphor. 20 MN. p. 17. 21 MN. pp. 8-9. Also pp. 632-638. 22 On the relationship between human perfection and apprehension of God, see Julius Guttmann, Philosophies of Judaism. Translated from the German.

And Marvin Fox, Interpreting Maimonides. (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1990). I restrict philosophers to the masculine only because this is expressly Maimonides' view; indeed, to interpret Maimonides without keeping this restriction in mind would seriously distort his views. It is hardly necessary to repeat that the self-understandings of</page><page sequence="14">14 Peter Eli Gordon JSQ 2 As a first step, we should recall Maimonides' summary of the parable above: "And we shall explain in various chapters of this Treatise his [Solomon's] wisdom in likening matter to a married harlot." Significantly, Maimonides summarizes the parable by reestablishing the link between the external and internal senses. There is, he suggests, something apt in the simile that matter is like a married harlot. When we consider that the Guide as a whole wants to purge metaphor in favor of philosophical interpretation, it should not seem surprising that Maimonides not only verifies the figurative language, but forcefully declares that, in this case, it is wise [khacham] to employ it. Philosophers and rabbis are both men of wisdom [ha-khachamim], and the notion of wisdom occupies a special lexical position in the Guide: An explanation of this term makes up the final chapter of the book, and Maimonides emphasizes that of its fourfold meanings, its philosophical sense is applied to "the apprehension [hasagah] of true realities, which have for their end the apprehension of Him." In Maimonides' account of wisdom we have the supreme example of his thoroughgoing adherence to the Hellenistic ideal of human perfection, according to which man is perfected through contemplation alone. Thus the powerful statement from the final chapter: "The fourth species [of wisdom] is the true human perfection; it consists in the acquisition of the rational virtues - I refer to the conception of intelligibles, which teach true opinions concerning the divine things. This is in true reality the ultimate end; this is what gives the individual true perfection, a perfection belonging to him alone; and it gives him permanent perdurance; through it man is man." Given this careful lexigraphic treatment of the term wisdom, we are confronted with a puzzling fact: Maimonides apparently believed there was a real and internal relation - one that would matter to philosophers - between a married harlot and matter.24 In essence, he has suggested that the relation is substantial, not metaphorical. As a second step, we should pay attention to Maimonides' claims that certain types of men do not make good philosophers; that is, they cannot reach perfection. Many people, he notes, possess simply by nature "a complexion of temperament with which perfection is in no way Western philosophy and Jewish (as well as Christian and Islamic) religion took their present shape in no small degree exactly because women were (grossly speaking) excluded; their actual exclusion makes their metaphorical presence all the more imposing and important, since, as I want to show, the male philosopher is supposed continuously to reenact their banishment. Ambivalence towards sexuality and towards women works inversely with the Maimonidean striving towards an erotic relationship to God. On the highly specific meaning of the term "wisdom" in the Guide, see MN. pp. 632-638.</page><page sequence="15">(1995) The Erotics of Negative Theology 15 compatible." And he then lists some of these types: "Such is the case of one whose heart is naturally exceedingly hot; for he cannot refrain from anger, even if he subject his soul to very stringent training. This is also the case of one whose testicles have a hot and humid temperament and are of a strong constitution and in whom the seminal vessels abundantly generate semen." Passages of this sort are provocative and their importance can be exaggerated. What is striking is not so much the explicit anatomical reference - Maimonides was also a physician and he knew the traditional medical jargon - but the reason Maimonides gives for excluding men of this sort from philosophy:25 He thinks that even if they subject themselves to "the most severe training" they will not be able to restrain their passions.26 Their bodies are already spectacular signs of disorder, and their thoughts will be similarly jumbled. In short, unrestrained sexual activity is taken as an impediment to philosophy. Given this medical observation, Maimonides concludes that the physical nature of a man is a potential obstacle to philosophical speculation, and perceives here a real link between the "matter" of the philosopher and his failure to grasp the internal sense of biblical language: When the philosopher attends solely to the corporeal self and its gratification, he is restricted to the merely external stratum of interpretation. Ensnarement in matter means an ensnarement in metaphor. Maimonides has constructed a series of analogies that are more than analogies. The theological error of literalism (taking language of God's corporeality for accurate description) has as one of its real sources an overactive sexuality. Sex involves attention to the human body, and one of its theological consequences can be anthropomorphism; ascribing to God a human body. Both the materiality [khomer] of the text and the materiality [khomer] of the body are the "screen" [mavdil' that lies between "the eye and a visible thing" and are both obstructions to correct philosophical apprehension [hasagah]. But more striking is the conclusion that "matter is a like a married harlot." The man who is led into adultery is tempted by his own body and by the body of the woman, and as a consequence will be unfit for philosophy. In short, we have found our way through a thicket of homologies, and when taken together they affirm an unlikely route leading from human imperfection to textual misinterpreta- tion, from the human body to God's body, and from adultery to literalism. 25 See, for example, his letter to al-Afdal, On the Management of Health. Maimonides wrote this treatise as a personal favor to this ruler of Egypt, who had written to Rambam that he suffered from anxiety, fear of death, indigestion, constipation, and so on. 26 MN. p. 77.</page><page sequence="16">16 Peter Eli Gordon JSQ 2 Part II: Adultery and Idolatry. Thus far I have followed Maimonides as he developed the wisdom in likening matter to a married harlot. The general principle in the Guide is to purge metaphor and recover the hidden philosophical content in biblical language, but Maimonides seemingly departs from this principle in his discussion of adultery and matter. He finds it wise to compare matter with a married harlot, and further suggests that the simile expresses his own philosophical project on a grand scale; since one of the central tasks of the Guide will be to show how in the philosopher every im- perfection and every misapprehension of God derive in the final analysis from the philosopher's "matter." This inconsistency, I want to suggest, is not as strange as it might at first appear, since the association of matter and adultery is part of an old and familiar topos. Recall the text of Ezekiel 16: You were naked and bare when I passed by you . . . and saw that your time for love had arrived. So I spread my robe over you and covered your nakedness, and I entered into a covenant with you by oath - declares the Lord God; thus you became Mine. . . . But confident in your beauty and fame, you played the harlot: you lavished your favors on every passerby; they were his. You even took some of your cloths and made yourself tapestried platforms and fornicated on them . . . You took your beautiful things, made of the gold and silver that I had given you, and you made yourself phallic images and fornicated with them. In this remarkable passage, idolatry is represented through the relationship of a jealous husband and his adulterous wife. The children of Israel are represented as a woman, originally in wretched conditions but transformed by God (through the Covenant) to become his wife and erotic partner ("I spread my robe over you"). But she is unfaithful; she gives away the gifts God has granted her and worships idols, unmistakably represented as sexual substitutions for her husband. The analogy of idolatry as an adulterous relationship between Israel and foreign gods is first found in Ezekiel, Hosea, and Jeremiah, and became a common figure of speech in the Talmud. It is not explicitly used by Maimonides but we can be sure he was aware of it if only because he would have found its anthropomorphism so outrageous. The power of the analogy in fact depends upon its extensive efforts to describe God as a jealous husband: Idolatry is wrong, this analogy suggests, because it violates a husband's trust in his bride; it makes God angry just as it would a man, and, if patriarchal society considers adultery a transgression, then it must consider adultery against God all the more reprehensible.27 27 For a thoroughgoing treatment of the traditional reading of idolatry as a variety of</page><page sequence="17">(1995) The Erotics of Negative Theology 17 Presumably, Maimonides would have insisted the analogy was purely external and fanciful. He could not have found it philosophically meaningful since he rejected anthropomorphism. He may very well have believed that ensnarement in adulterous difficulties is substantively related to ensnarement in metaphor, but he could not have adopted the apparently obvious corollary that philosophical devotion is like a proper marriage, since this is a robust anthropomorphism. And he would have found erotic anthropomorphism especially scandalous, since it involves ascribing to God not just human attributes but attributes that humans share with beasts.28 Most importantly, we can recognize in the analogy a potential paradox, one that certainly did not escape Maimonides: How is it that the prophets and rabbis could deploy overt anthropomorphism as a way to combat idolatry?29 The Guide is dedicated to the purging of metaphor, and for Maimonides any literal understanding of divine description, not only overt anthropomorphism, involves the reader in interpretative errors at least as grave as idol worship. That is, for Maimonides all literalism is like idolatry. Maimonides introduces the argument that literalism is like idolatry in chapter 36 of the Guide. He notes that throughout the Torah and all the books of the prophets, expressions concerning God's wrath, anger and jealousy are deployed exclusively in reference to idolatry, and the terms enemy of God, adversary, or hater are used to designate only idolaters. Maimonides then says that whatever "concerns a false opinion attaching to Him, may He be exalted, I [call] idolatrous worship." This definition has far-reaching consequences. Maimonides begins by constructing a typolo- gy of false opinions. First, there is the simple false report of a certain state of affairs, such as when "one believes that Zayd is standing at a time when he is sitting." Second, there is the more grave false report such as when adultery, see Halbertal and Margalit, Idolatry. Op cit. pp. 9-36. I rely closely on their analysis for the interpretation presented here. "I mean that man should not follow his bestial nature; I mean his matter, for the proximate matter of man is identical with proximate matter of the other living beings." MN. p. 14. As Halbertal and Margalit have argued, this is not of necessity a paradox. When we interpret the relationship between God and Israel as an exclusive marriage, thereby forbidding the worship of other gods, it is the anthropomorphism itself that, in their words, "gives meaning" to the sin of idolatry. But this is to take an approach radically different and, we might say, more relaxed than Maimonides, for whom anthropomor- phism itself is one of the chief marks of idolatry. Using the adultery metaphor to condemn idol worship becomes paradoxical only if anthropomorphism is considered a species of idol worship. The analogy was not paradoxical to the prophets and the rabbis of the Talmud, but it is deeply paradoxical when considered from Maimonides' perspective. See Halbertal and Margalit, Op cit. pp. 10-11.</page><page sequence="18">18 Peter Eli Gordon JSQ2 someone believes "that fire is under the air or water under the earth or that the earth is flat and other things of a similar kind." Third, there is the false opinion, more grave still, of one who "believes that the sun consists of fire or that the heavenly sphere forms a hemisphere and other things of a similar kind." Fourth, there is the kind of false opinion such as when someone believes that "the angels eat and drink and other things of a similar kind." Finally, Maimonides tells us, this fourth kind of deviation from the truth is distinct from the deviation "of him who believes that a thing other than God ought to be worshipped." Notice that the typology moves from statements about things one might encounter immediately to reports about things that are increasingly remote and associated with the heavens. He emphasizes that "whenever ignorance and infidelity bear upon a great thing . . . they are of greater consequence than if they bear upon someone who was of a lower rank."30 This remark is crucial to the ensuing argument. Maimonides argues that among those performing idolatrous worship, no one truly believes that the idol itself is the deity. Rather, the idol worshipper is in fact someone who uses the idol as an "intermediary between ourselves and God." No one, Maimonides argues, "has ever imagined on any day, and no human being of the future will ever imagine, that the form that he fashions either from cast metal or from stone and wood has created and governs the heavens and the earth." Instead, Maimonides argues that the idol is worshipped "in respect of its being an image of [the] thing." The distinction is one he has already presented in his Mishneh Tor ah in the section on Abodah Zarah. Since the idol worshipper uses the idol only as a device of mediation between himself and God, one might expect that his error is not catastrophic. But Maimonides dashes our expectations at this point. "In spite of the fact that those infidels believe in the existence of the deity, their idolatrous worship entails their deserving destruction; for the reason that their infidelity bears upon a prerogative reserved to God alone, may He be exalted - I mean the prerogative of being worshipped and magnified. ... This is so ordained in order that God's existence may be firmly established in the belief of the multitude." For Maimonides, the distinction between the educated few and the unschooled masses is of great importance. The idol worshipper may understand that he is worshipping God through the idol, but he might 30 "By infidelity, I mean belief about a thing that is different from what the thing really is. By ignorance, I mean ignorance of what it is possible to know." MN. pp. 82-85. See also Pines' note on the definition of infidelity, p. 83. As far as I have been able to ascertain, the pun on fidelity only works in the English translation, and thus has no significance.</page><page sequence="19">(1995) The Erotics of Negative Theology 19 mislead others into thinking that his deity is actually something other than God, "for the multitude grasp only the actions of worship, not their meanings or the true reality of the Being worshipped through them." Mediated worship is dangerous because it can appear as idol worship, even though it is not. Consequently, Maimonides confirms that "the idolatrous worship of the infidels entails their deserving destruction" and he cites as proof Deuteronomy 20: 16, "Thou shalt not save alive a soul."31 Maimonides has now established that idol worship is in fact not an error about God himself; rather, it is a misleading use of intermediate objects. Yet even this error warrants death. He now brings this fact to bear in a remarkable fashion: What then should be the state of him whose infidelity bears upon His essence, may He be exalted, and consists in believing Him to be different from what He really is? I mean to say that he does not believe that He exists; or believes that there are two gods, or that He is a body, or that he is subject to affections; or again that he ascribes to God some deficiency or other. Such a man in indubitably more blameworthy than a worshipper of idols who regards the latter as intermediaries. ...32 Having established that idolatry is a crime that deserves death, Maimonides now states that interpretative literalism is a crime of even greater proportions. The argument must be analyzed in detail. Maimo- nides has defined infidelity as believing about a thing something different from what that thing really is.33 An idolater, on his account, may warrant the charge of infidelity, but the label of idol worshipper will be imprecise. An idolater believes that the idol is an intermediary between himself and God, which it is not, and this makes an idolater's error something like that of someone who reports Zayd is sitting when he is in fact standing. It is a mistake of the mundane variety. But the untrained mind might mistakenly believe the idol worshipper is worshipping the idol and not God at all. It is this potential to mislead that touches God and warrants the idol worshipper's death. Yet the idol worshipper himself is not the one who has committed this error; it is merely a potential, third-person mis- interpretation of his actions. By contrast, someone who holds a false belief regarding the essence of God is committing an infidelity of the worst sort, according to Maimonides' typology: "Know accordingly," he warns the reader, "that when you believe in the doctrine of the corporeality of God or believe that one of the states of the body belongs to Him, you provoke 31 MR p. 84. 32 Ibid. " See note 19.</page><page sequence="20">20 Peter Eli Gordon JSQ 2 his jealousy and anger, kindle the fire of His wrath, and are a hater, an enemy, and adversary of God, much more so than an idolater." These are strong claims, and Maimonides knows that they will inspire objections. One may object, he says, that believers in God's corporeality cannot be held responsible for their error since they were raised on such stuff, and perhaps they are too uneducated or too dull-witted to grasp the true doctrine. But if one exculpates philosophical errors that concern the essence of God, then one should certainly excuse the idolater, his crime being the less severe. Further, one might object that "the external sense of the biblical text causes men to fall into this doubt." But is this, Maimonides asks, truly an excuse? "You ought to know that an idolater is similarly impelled to his idolatry by imaginings and defective representations."34 False beliefs that touch on the nature of God himself are errors of the most serious variety. They are analogous to the sin of idolatry but in fact worse. On Maimonides' account, these false beliefs can arise when one sticks to the external sense of phrases that involve divine predication, and when one takes this external sense for accurate representation. Now since Maimonides knows that not everyone is a philosopher, he does not expect everyone to know why the external sense cannot be taken literally, but he does expect those who are not philosophers to believe it in any event: "I do not consider as an infidel one who cannot demonstrate that the corporeality of God should be negated. But I do consider as an infidel one who does not believe in its negation." Here Maimonides seems to adopt the distinction, common in classical philosophy, between true belief and justified true belief, and he holds that only the former is necessary, the latter is for the philosophers who can achieve it. 35 Maimonides concludes that "there is no excuse for one who does not accept the authority of men who inquire into the truth and are engaged in speculation if he himself is incapable of engaging in such speculation." By drawing this distinction, Maimonides protects himself from the charge that all of the uneducated - those who cannot understand the philosophical subtleties of the internal sense - would deserve destruction. Instead, those who do not grasp the reasons for the negation of the external sense are expected to bow to the greater intelligence of those who do. We have seen, then, that Maimonides likens the error of literalism to the error of idolatry, except that the error committed in contemplation and 34 MN. p. 85. 35 See, for example, Plato's Theaitetos. Also see Charles Manekin on the philosophical importance of "true belief" in Maimonides. {Op cit.).</page><page sequence="21">(1995) The Erotics of Negative Theology 21 interpretation is in fact worse than the error committed in practical worship. If we read Maimonides without suspecting him of hyperbole, literalism warrants death just as idolatry warrants death. The most abusive terms - hater of God, enemy of God, and so on - are applicable to the idolater and a fortiori to the literalist as well. It should not seem at all surprising that Maimonides considers the sin of literalism worse than idolatry. If we recall his requirements for human perfection, it is above all the intellectual perfection of the philosopher that concerns him, and the philosopher arrives at intellectual perfection through the correct apprehension of God. If correct apprehension demands that one does not hold as true a statement about God's essence that is actually false, then what Maimonides calls the "infidelity" of such beliefs leaves the philosopher in the most imperfect condition possible. If Maimonides makes literalism something like the cognitive analogue to idolatry, literalism reflects not only an imperfect understanding, but an imperfect human being. The Guide is apparently at war with one of its own principles. The traditional association of idolatry and adultery is something Maimonides would have rejected because it involves anthropomorphism. But we have also seen how Maimonides describes the task of the Guide as a whole as a demonstration of Solomon's wisdom when he compared matter to a married harlot. The simile is apt because "all the hindrances keeping man from his ultimate perfection, every deficiency affecting him and every disobedience, come to him from his matter alone." Since matter and metaphor are both the "screen" that hides the inner sense of the text from the philosopher, they are also the obstacles to his perfection. Wordly, unrestrained sexuality is therefore one of the greatest of these obstacles barring a man from divine apprehension. In short, literalism is idol worship, and idol worship in its turn is a departure from monogamy. This conclusion, however, is ironic. It commits Maimonides to the traditional metaphor according to which idolatry is a kind of adultery - an anthropomorphism he would have in principle rejected. If literalism is compared to an adulterous liaison, then one might wish to infer that for Maimonides too, the philosopher's proper relationship to God would be like a marriage, an exclusive encounter that admits of no competition and no infidelities. But this would be an unwarranted inference, since Maimonides has so far employed the traditional metaphor only in its negative sense: Distractions from the proper understanding of God are like adulterous liaisons, but this does not entail that the philosopher's relationship with God is like a nonadulterous marriage. If one recalls the puzzling analogy of matter and the married harlot, one can</page><page sequence="22">22 Peter Eli Gordon JSQ 2 see that Maimonides hints at the marriage metaphor without declaring it outright. Thus he writes that "we shall explain how he concluded this book of his with a eulogy of the woman who is not a harlot but confines herself to attending to the welfare of her household and husband." Maimonides tells us about the distractions but only indirectly about God. Or, to put it differently, he alludes to the adultery but says little of the marriage itself. His hostility to anthropomorphism would lead him to reject the traditional metaphor of marriage, yet he appears on the verge of assenting to its use, even if his assent seems oblique. Such uncertainty helps to illustrate the most difficult and technical aspect of Maimonides' thought; he will insist, after all, that description surrounds God only to be negated. But it is worth a short digression to note how the uncertainty of sexual metaphor touches upon the respective identities of the philosopher and God. If one were to infer that God and the philosopher are partners in marriage, a curious problem arises. Maimonides seems to have complicated the usual analogy for idol worship, according to which God is the husband and Israel is his adulterous bride. In Maimonides' arguments the roles are less certain. The philosopher appears to be male and his potential partner in adultery seems to be female (she is the matter that distracts him), while the gender of God is unknown: Perhaps God is the philosopher's proper wife. But we can also say that the philosopher is the female bride, while God, in agreement with the traditional metaphor, is the female philosopher's husband. The attempt to describe God in positive terms seems to have become muddled, and this confusion is not unimportant. Even where the traditional analogy seems to be in play, Maimonides struggles to refrain from its use as this would reveal an objectionable anthropomorphism. We are left with the incomplete and negative claim that literalism is like adultery; but we lack the means to express the positive relationship between the philosopher and God. Part III: Attribution and Negation It is no accident that, according to the interpretation above, Maimonides has employed analogies when he wishes to describe for his reader what God is not, but less so to describe what God in fact is. He refrains from illustrating the proper relationship between the philosopher and the God he apprehends, even while he indulges the traditional metaphor of adultery to describe how the philosopher's apprehension can go wrong. Maimonides' apparent consistency in this respect is significant. At the</page><page sequence="23">(1995) The Erotics of Negative Theology 23 core of Maimonides' refusal is his notoriously difficult doctrine concern- ing God's attributes, according to which God's essence is utterly unknown and positive attribution impossible. In the final analysis, the Guide subtly and allusively retains some positive relationship between God and the philosopher; a relationship of "proximity" analogous to an erotic encounter. The erotic relationship is in great measure a consequence of the doctrine of attributes. The large scale architectonic of the Guide, as I have tried to show, moves from perplexity to perfection by providing philosophical explanations in the place of misleadingly figurative language. The educative ladder, however, now moves from obviously anthropomorphic language and chooses as its target highly abstract and philosophical vocabulary, eliminating even the most rarified sorts of divine ascriptions. In essence, the educative process is one that punishes cognition, robbing it of its tools and rendering it helpless. To make room for an erotic theophany, Maimonides has to exhaust all possible cognitive avenues.36 In the following section I have tried to reproduce in its broadest outlines the theory of attribution and negation which eventually leads Maimonides to abandon cognition as it is commonly understood. In its most subtle sense, literalism consists in false beliefs about the essence of God. Maimonides provided various examples of these false beliefs, for instance, not believing that He exists; or believing that there are two gods, or that "He is a body," or that he is subject to affections; or ascribing to God "some deficiency or other."37 All of these beliefs are false because they violate the fundamental fact of God's uniqueness, which Maimonides' doctrine of attributes is supposed to preserve. According to Maimonides, God is unique in two important respects. First, God's essence does not consist in a unity of discreet attributes. If God's essence, for example, were to consist in being all-powerful and all-wise, this would indicate two discreet qualities within God. Such a situation would be intolerable because it trespasses on God's utter indivisibility. Furthermore, it does not help to say that God's essence has two attributes added to it, as if these attributes were distinct from God's essence, since this would imply that God is not essentially all-wise, all-powerful, and so on, but merely becomes that way through added features. This would indicate an imperfection in God's essence. Even to utter statements attributing to God some feature implies a division between the subject and the predicate, 36 I am thinking here of Kant, who established the limits of knowledge to make room for faith. 51 MN. p. 84.</page><page sequence="24">24 Peter Eli Gordon JSQ 2 once again introducing multiplicity into the essence of God. Second, God is different from other objects in that his essence and his existence are one. It could not be the case that God's existence is something superadded to his essence, since this would imply that God does not necessarily exist, and would also introduce once again a multiplicity within God. But God is Aristotle's First Cause - a chain of causes can be traced back from object to object in the world, and the chain will never rest until one reaches God. God is the first cause of all things and, unlike all other things, is not himself caused. In short, his existence is not accidental to his essence: he necessarily exists.38 For these reasons, Maimonides argues that positive propositional statements about God necessarily fail. Let us assume for the moment that all knowledge takes the form of positive predication; that is, linking subjects to predicates and thereby attributing qualities to the subject. If so, thia means that knowledge of God is impossible. For if the utterance, 'God is this or that', must fail, then the philosopher can never arrive at knowledge of God. The only imaginable exception to this rule is the case of the tautology that "God is God." But this is not truly an exception because as a tautology it does not succeed in expanding our knowledge of the subject. Maimonides ingeniously interprets the tetragrammaton, God's highest name, according to this insight. Moses asks of God what he should say to the people when they ask, "What is his Name?" The response he receives is "I am that I am", that is, YHVH. According to Maimonides' linguistic analysis, this response is tautological. But it is nonetheless an instructive tautology, since "scripture makes, as it were, a clear statement that the subject is identical with the predicate." And this is another way of saying that "He is existence not through existence," that is, God is not a multiplicity where existence is something contingent to essence, because God necessarily exists.39 In conclusion, actual knowledge of God is impossible. Positive propositional statements about God should therefore be abandoned. Given this rather robust rejection, we are left with a sense that language itself may be unhelpful when contemplating God. Indeed, Maimonides will summarize his theory of attribution at the end of chapter 58, Book I, with a strange exhortation: "Glory then to Him who is such that . . . when the tongues aspire to magnify Him by means of attributive qualifications, all eloquence turns into weariness and incapacity!" In Maimonides' commentary on the Mishnah (Aboth, I. 17), he explains the virtue of the 38 See especially chapter 57, MN. pp. 132-33. 39 MN. pp. 153-157.</page><page sequence="25">(1995) The Erotics of Negative Theology 25 phrase from Ecclesiastes, "For God is in heaven and thou upon the earth; therefore let thy words be few."40 It seems that we have reached the end of philosophical discourse and the beginning, perhaps, of mysticism.41 It is precisely this tendency which Rosenzweig attacked as "epistemological lamentation." But the philosopher is not a mystic, and he cannot simply fall silent. The unfortunate occurrence of biblical predications demands some explanation. How are we to understand the phrases that God is just, God is wise, God is good, God is jealous, and so on? Maimonides needs to provide the philosopher with an interpretation of the "inner sense" to such language in the Torah and elsewhere, a way to understand divine predication that avoids treating it as positive attribution. On his account, there are two distinct but related interpretations for such a case. The first of these interprets divine predications as attributes of action, while the second interprets them as negations of privations.42 A well-known and authoritative source would have it that "in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." A phrase such as this appears to involve some knowledge claim about God. Furthermore, throughout the Bible a variety of God's actions are described, and this must surely provoke the philosopher's worry that perhaps a multiplicity of descriptions indicates a multiplicity within God. But Maimonides interprets such phrases as indicating God's actions. As actions, they proceed from God as their source, but they do not touch his essence. Maimonides suggests that we take as an analogy an individual who is sometimes a carpenter and at other times a weaver. 43 Such an individual's singularity is not compromised by the diversity of his effects. Or, take the example of fire: "If some man would predicate of fire that it is that which bleaches and blackens, which burns and cooks, which makes hard and 40 MN. p. 628. On Maimonides and mysticism see the suggestive insights of Julius Guttmann, Philosophies of Judaism. On the topic of discursive failure in the religious sphere, the reader may notice a certain unlikely resemblance between Maimonides and the early Wittgenstein. See Alexander Altmann, "The God of Theology and the God of Wittgenstein." (citation missing) as well as Fergus Kerr, Theology after Wittgenstein. (New York: Basil Blackwell, 1986). Also see D. Z. Phillips, Wittgenstein and Religion. (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1993). The literature on this aspect of Maimonides' thought is extensive and notoriously difficult. My attempt at a quick summary is, of course, inadequate, but some parts hopefully provide original insights. Of the voluminous literature I am endebted most to the various essays and studies by the following authors: Julius Guttmann, Hermann Cohen, Harry Wolfson, Z. Diesendruck, Alexander Altmann, Shlomo Pines, Leo Strauss, Yirmiyahu Yovel and Amos Funkenstein.

But this is not because there are six diverse features of fire by which it acts in these distinct ways. Rather, "he who knows the nature of fire knows that it performs all of these actions by virtue of one active quality, namely, heat."44 Similarly, God acts in diverse ways without this diversity indicating a multiplicity within. According to this interpretation, attributions that apparently describe God are to be read as attributes of divine actions, where "one Essence performs diverse actions."45 One should also remember that Maimonides needs the interpretation of divine predica- tions as attributes of action because they play a central role in his moral theory, where people are called upon to imitate God's actions so far as they are able.46 But all the while the reader is admonished to remember that "the attributes ascribed to Him are attributes of His actions . . . they do not mean that He possesses qualities."47 In this fashion Maimonides manages to adopt the moral principle of imitatio Dei while avoiding the dilemma that we must know God in order to follow his example. One knows only his actions, not God himself. One might suppose that this theory has dispelled all worrisome cases of divine predication. Indeed, Maimonides' theory of attributes of action is meant to account for each and every moment when God has come into a relation with the created world. We do, in fact, know something of God; we know his actions in this world. When we say of God that he is merciful and gracious or long-suffering, we in fact know how God acts; he acts mercifully, graciously, and so on. This, Maimonides tells us, is the meaning of Moses' phrase "Show me now Thy ways, that I may know Thee." Moses knew of God's ways, but nothing of God an sich. This interpretation expresses a certain humility regarding the powers and limits of human cognition; it tells us that our knowledge of God extends just to the edges of his activity. In philosophical terminology, what Maimonides has provided so far is a theory of God's relational qualities - qualities that we are justified in ascribing to him only in so far as he is in a relation to us.48 Yet outside of this relation our knowledge fails us entirely. Given a correct understanding of the attributes of action, we are now forced to admit that it is insufficient.

Such features are not relational; they hold true of God whatever his state of action and outside of any possible relation to us. Thus we confront the fact that "the One Essence performs diverse actions, but the attributes that are essential to Him, ... do not belong to His actions."50 To account for divine predications that apparently give knowledge of God's essence, Maimo- nides is compelled to provide a second theory, which involves the so-called negation of privations. It is perhaps the most interpreted facet of the Guide, and it is this theory that earns Maimonides' philosophy the title of a negative theology, for, according to this theory, all positive knowledge concerning God's essence is impossible. According to Aristotle's logic, negation may indicate one of two things.51 First, a negation may be a simple denial that a certain object has the attribute in question, where it would at least be possible for the object to have that attribute. To take an example that Maimonides knew well, consider the question of whether Socrates has sight. Since Socrates is a man and men can either see or not see, one could coherently say either that Socrates sees or Socrates does not see. The negation is therefore a simple one denying to a subject an attribute it could naturally have. The second sort of negation indicates that a certain object does not have an attribute, where that object could not naturally have that attribute. Again take a classical example known to Maimonides: "The walls do not have eyes." On Aristotle's account, this phrase is true, but only because its negation expresses the fact that walls are not objects of which sight can naturally be predicated. In more familiar terminology, one can say that true statements involving negations of this second sort express the fact that an affirmative statement would be a category mistake. The general principle here is that, as Maimonides puts it, "one sometimes denies with reference to a thing something that cannot fittingly exist in it."52 Numerous examples of synaesthesia help to demonstrate this idea: "It cannot be predicated of sweetness that it is either crooked or straight, ... just as it cannot be predicated of sound that it is either salty or insipid."53 49 MN. p. 149 and p. 119. wMN.p. 121.

In the Aristotelian view, however, categorical differences included a further meaning they no longer possess. Objects fell into certain divisions or natural kinds and it was accepted that scientific explanations clung to the particular nature of the object. Only with the Enlightenment did scientific explanation presume to generalize its claims across genus and species, and such generalization marked the end of Aristotelian science.54 Given the Aristotelian view, however, statements of negation could mean not only the negation of the first sort, described above as simple denial, but also negation of the second sort, described above as indications of a category mistake.55 Unlike the modern view, the negation which indicates a category mistake also warns of a leap across the diverse qualities and natures that are inherent in the variety of the world. Maimonides not only subscribed to this view, but believed that the difference between God and the world was the most profound of all qualitative differentiations. No matter how dissimilar two objects of the world, they are necessarily alike in several crucial respects; most importantly, their essence is contingent. Thus a mustard seed and the sphere of the fixed stars, to take Maimonides' own example, are alike. From their similarity it is feasible to assign like attributes to each without falling into a category mistake; thus they can both be said to have dimension, no matter how small the one and no matter how large the other. But between God and us, Maimonides observes, there is no likeness whatsoever. Attributes that apply to the world can never apply to God; they have in common "the name and nothing else."56 Trying positively to assign attributes to God is analogous to synaesthesia, except that synaesthesia involves a mixing among the senses while divine predication tries to assign predicates of sense to a realm beyond sense. Divine attribution is the most grave category mistake. Given this doctrine, Maimonides can employ the second meaning of negation where he wishes to indicate the error in divine predication. The result is that phrases of the sort "God is not such and such" are always 54 Amos Funkenstein, Theology and the Scientific Imagination from the Middle Ages to the Seventeenth Century.

This gives Maimonides one half of his theory of the negation of privations. The latter half of his doctrine concerns the notion of privative propositions, also borrowed from Aristotle and his Arabic commentators. A privation is an attribute that indicates an imperfection or lack in an object, such as when one says that "Socrates is blind" - blindness being taken as a privation. Unlike negative propositions, on Maimonides' account privatives cannot meaningfully be assigned to objects in which the corresponding perfection would not naturally appear. One may say that Socrates is blind only because there is some sense to the proposition that Socrates is sighted. But one may not say that a wall is blind, because the corresponding perfection of sightedness could never naturally be ascribed to a wall. To say either that a wall is blind or that a wall is sighted is to commit a category mistake and results in a phrase that is neither true nor false but meaningless.57 Armed with the logical tools of negation and privation Maimonides ingeniously combines them. God must be thought of as lacking any imperfection and any multiplicity, so one would wish to say, for example, that God is powerful. But Maimonides has shown us that such ascription is impossible. His philosophical understanding of the phrase transforms it; the positive ascription of a perfection is to be logically understood as the negation of a privation. One cannot say "God is powerful" but one can say "God is not powerless." To say "God is powerful" would be a category mistake and thus meaningless, but to say "God is powerless" would be meaningless as well, since privatives cannot be ascribed to objects where their corresponding perfections could not naturally appear. On logical grounds alone Maimonides is driven to conclude that the only true and meaningful interpretation of the phrase "God is powerful" is the phrase "God is not powerless."58 57 The important distinction between category mistakes that result in meaningless propositions and the negation of category mistakes that result in true propositions is a distinction either not found or considerably confused in Margalit and Halbertal, which causes some obscurity in their presentation. See their Idolatry. Op cit. p. 1 54. Harry Wolfson, along with other commentators, has pointed out the remarkable similarity between Maimonides' theory of the negation of privations and the Kantian interpretation of the so-called "infinite judgement." Wolfson later decided that the similarity was only partial. See Wolfson, "Cresças on the Problem of Divine Attributes" in Jewish Quarterly Review. 1 (1916), pp. 20-22.

Maimonides restricts a proper understanding of this doctrine to the philosophers alone, and among them a complete mastery of logic is demanded so as not to fall into an error worse than idolatry. The philosopher knows something of God's activity but nothing of God's essence, except what that essence is not. Language serves a meager function here; the will to knowledge that is accustomed to descriptions and ascriptions finds itself humiliated. The constant failures of accurate predication seem to open an insuperable chasm between God and human cognition. Indeed, Maimonides seems to accept the counsel, "For God is in heaven and thou upon the earth; therefore let thy words be few." Doubts may now arise: Of what purpose is a religion when its God is so remote from experience? One might be led to conclude that the God of Maimonides is a God of profound negativity, a mere phantom. The doctrinal divorce between man and God seems too complete; it gives no satisfaction at all. Indeed, this was the sort of God Hegel found in Judaism. He believed that Judaism is inferior to Christianity precisely because the God of Judaism is wholly sublime and other from the world. Where Christianity, he thought, overcomes God's transcendence through divine incorporation, Judaism remains at the more primitive level of "divided consciousness."59 And Rosenzweig, for quite different reasons, concluded that this doctrine amounts to "epistemological lamentation." Part IV: The Erotics of Apprehension By chapter 59, Maimonides has largely concluded his exposition of the doctrine of negations, and he writes what are perhaps some of the most perplexing lines in the entire Guide to the Perplexed. If understood, they reveal a much neglected aspect of Maimonides' philosophy.60 He writes Perceptions of Jewish History. (Berkeley: The University of California Press, 1993), p. 142, n. 33. See, among other works, Hegel's Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion. And see the essay by Yirmiyahu Yovel, "God's Transcendence and its Schematization: Maimonides in Light of the Spinoza-Hegel Dispute" in S. Pines and Y. Yovel (Eds.), Maimonides and Philosophy. (Dordrecht and Boston: Martinus Nijoff Publishers, 1986), pp. 269-282. MN. p. 139. I will excerpt a large portion of these admittedly "perplexing" lines, since their difficulty alone may be of interest: "As everyone is aware that it is not possible, except through negation, to achieve an apprehension of that which is in our power to</page><page sequence="31">(1995) The Erotics of Negative Theology 31 that a correct interpretation of the doctrine of negations leads the philosopher "nearer to an apprehension of Him" [tiqrav el ha-hasagah ve-tihiyeh yoter qarov elav ...].61 By contrast, if one affirms of God any attribute, "you get further away from the knowledge of His true reality [tirkhaq miyediat amitato].62 Yet at the same time he affirms that "negation does not give knowledge in any respect of the true reality of the thing with regard to which the particular matter in question has been negated."63 And he therefore confirms that silence is praise, presumably since it avoids the errors associated with language. In concluding, Maimonides suggests that although knowledge is impossible, the general effort of the Guide is to help the philosopher arrive at greater proximity to God. As is typical, when Maimonides wishes to stress a point of doctrine he writes in the second person: "Bring your soul to understand this chapter, and direct your efforts to multiplying those times in which you are . . . endeavouring to approach Him and to decreasing those times in which ... you make no efforts to approach Him. This guidance is sufficient in view of the purpose of this Treatise."64 Maimonides seems to believe that there is a relationship to God, apprehension, that is importantly distinct from knowledge.65 While actual knowledge of God is impossible, apprehension is not only attainable but seems to be the goal of all philosophical activity.66 Maimonides argues that apprehension of God comes about through a correct understanding apprehend and that, on the other hand, negation does not give knowledge in any respect of the true reality of the thing with regard to which the particular matter in question has been negated - all men, those of the past and those of the future, affirm clearly that God, may He be exalted, cannot be apprehended by the intellects, and that none but He Himself can apprehend what He is, and that apprehension of Him consists in the inability to attain the ultimate term in apprehending Him. Thus all the philosophers say: We are dazzled by His beauty, and He is hidden from us because of the intensity with which He becomes manifest, just as the sun is hidden to eyes that are too weak to apprehend it. This has been expatiated upon in words that it would serve no useful purpose to repeat here. The most apt phrase concerning this subject is the dictum occurring in the Psalms, Silence is Praise to Thee." 61 MN. d. 138. 62 MN. d. 139. 63 MN. p. 139. 64 MN. p. 628. 65 See the extended quotation from MN. Chapter 59, at note 59 above. And see my remarks on Michael Blaustein, note 1 5 above. 66 Maimonides' other writings confirm this distinction. See, for example, Mishnah Zera'im , according to which "apphrehension of the unity of God" is the end of man. (ed. Jerusalem, 1963, pp. 41-42). And recall here the lines from the very first chapter of the Guide, where Maimonides affirms that "man possesses as his [unique] ... property ... something in him that is very strange as it is not found in anything else that exists in the sublunar sphere, namely ... apprehension [hasagah yeda'it]."</page><page sequence="32">32 Peter Eli Gordon JSQ 2 of the theory of divine attributes. Specifically, divine attribution and philosophical apprehension relate through inverse proportion: When the philosopher negates an attribute he comes nearer to apprehension, and when he affirms an attribute he retreats from apprehension. To understand these arguments we must try to gain some insight into the idea of apprehension [hasagah] and the metaphors of distance and proximity used in respect to it.67 The metaphors are perplexing because Maimonides has himself warned that, since God is not a body, any terms of spatiality cannot apply. In one of the early lexigraphic chapters, Maimonides insists that the verb "to approach" [qarob] is analogous to "the proximity of one body to another" but in fact it means "the union of cognition with what is cognized." When applied to mundane objects proximity may in fact indicate spatial proximity, but when applied to God this is never so. God is not a body nor do spatial metaphors of any sort apply. Maimonides is quite explicit as to this point: "He . . . does not draw near to or approach a thing, nor does anything draw near to or approach Him . . . inasmuch as the abolition of corporeality entails that space be abolished; so that there is no nearness and proximity, and no remoteness, no union and no separation, no contact and no succession." But if spatial proximity is not meant, Maimonides' definition reads the philosopher's proximity to God as a cognitive state. We are advised that "in all these verses nearness through cognition, I mean cognitive apprehension [hasagah mada'it] is intended, not nearness in space." This definition is peculiar because it distinguishes knowledge from apprehension, but then suggests that apprehension is a cognitive - or knowing - state. If the philosopher draws near in cognitive apprehension, Maimonides is willing to use the more robust term knowledge [yedi'ah] when the philosopher is withdrawing (one gets "further away from a knowledge of his true reality"). This is consistent with Maimonides' general position. While knowledge is impossible, there are better and worse ways of apprehending, ways that bring one closer to apprehension while still not yielding knowledge. Apprehension is like proximity, but it is less than knowledge itself, being merely a knowing or cognitive 67 For a different argument, see Charles Manekin, "Belief, Certainty, and Divine attributes in the Guide to the Perplexed" in Maimonides Studies. Volume I., ed. Arthur Hyman. (New York: Yeshiva University Press, 1990). Manekin distinguishes between belief and knowledge, though the greater part of his quotations from the Guide (following p. 1 32) directly discuss apprehension, not belief. See the careful treatment of Maimonides' doctrine of apprehension and how this differs from true knowledge in Alexander Altmann "Maimonides on the Intellect and the Scope of Metaphysics" in Altmann, Von der mittelalterlichen zur modernen Aufklärung. (Tübingen: J. C. B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1987), pp. 76-77.</page><page sequence="33">(1995) The Erotics of Negative Theology 33 apprehension (Maimonides employs the adjectival mada 'ith as opposed to the substantive yediah). Such linguistic subtleties have a profound role in Maimonides' argument. One may summarize his position as follows: Through a proper understanding of the doctrine of negations the philosopher draws near to God, that is, he gains some variety of apprehension without, of course, reaching an ultimate knowledge of God. When, by contrast, someone who is perplexed for whatever reason affirms that God possesses attributes, that individual may be said to have a less precise apprehension. The metaphors of proximity and distance are used to describe superior and inferior apprehensions, and they have a purely intellectual status.68 At this point it is perhaps necessary to recall that Maimonides' guiding principles need not be ours. When he counsels the reader to interpret language according to its inner or philosophical sense, we need not follow him in assuming that this inner sense will give us a better understanding of his tactics, his arguments, and his perspectives. I have tried to suggest that at a crucial moment in the text Maimonides affirms that the external sense of at least one metaphor displays an openly philosophical wisdom, and it is now worth asking whether the metaphors of proximity hold any similar wisdom. To understand Maimonides' use of the term hasagah we can now move to the penultimate chapters of the Guide to the Perplexed. It should not be surprising that it is in these final pages that the philosophical motives for the text as a whole are finally announced, and in more striking and more colorful language. In Part III, chapter 51, Maimonides tells us that "We have already explained in preceding chapters that the meaning of knowledge of the Name is apprehension of Him" ['inyan yedi'at ha-shem hu hasagatho]. Given Maimonides' interpretation of the divine name as a tautology that indicates God's infinite difference from the things of the world, it makes sense that one route to the apprehension of God would be knowledge of this divine name. But Maimonides uses hasagah or apprehension in a richer sense. His aim in this chapter turns out to be an interpretation of the idea of passionate love. Maimonides presents the following phrase from Psalms 91:14.: "Because he hath set his passionate love upon Me [ki hi khashaq], therefore I will deliver Him; I will set him on high because he hath known My Name." Maimonides directly addresses his perplexed reader at this point; he wishes his reader to admit that "You know the difference between the terms one who loves [oheb] and one who loves passionately 68 Notice that the metaphor of proximity and distance is also at work in the much- discussed parable of the palace at III 51.</page><page sequence="34">34 Peter Eli Gordon JSQ 2 [khosheq]; an excess of love, so that no thought remains that is directed toward the thing other than the Beloved, is passionate love."69 The terminology of the Guide has become emotional and vaguely erotic. If there were any doubts before, Maimonides now dispells them with a striking return to the original metaphors of bodily obstruction and physical love: The bodily faculties impede in youth the attainment ... of pure thought . . . Yet in the measure in which the faculties of the body are weakened and the fire of the desires is quenched, the intellect is strengthened, ... its apprehension is purified, and it rejoices in what it apprehends. ... when a perfect man ... approaches death, this apprehension increases very powerfully, joy over this apprehension and a great love for the object of apprehension become stronger, until the soul is separated from the body at that moment in this state of pleasure. Because of this the Sages have indicated with reference to the deaths of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam that the three of them died by a kiss. They said that the dictum, And Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab by the mouth of the Lord, indicates that he died by a kiss. Similarly it is said of Aaron: By the mouth of the Lord, and died there. And they said of Miriam in the same way: She also died by a kiss. But with regard to her it is not said, by the mouth of the Lord; because she was a woman, the use of the figurative expression was not suitable with regard to her. Their purpose was to indicate that the three of them died in the pleasure of this apprehension due to the intensity of passionate love.70 The comparison between death and sexual union could be no more overt. Maimonides seems quite aware of the metaphorical game he has been playing; and it only serves to strengthen the metaphor when he demurs at the last moment, denying that Miriam's death could have been sealed with a kiss, since, as he notes soberly, "the figurative expression was not suitable."71 The philosophical meaning of apprehension has yielded almost entirely to figurative language, and Maimonides has shown that 69 MN. p. 627. 70 MN. pp. 627-628. There is something quite odd in Maimonides' reluctance to speak of God's kissing Miriam. The reluctance is not due to prudery; it points to a deeper refusal to abandon God's traditional representation as sexually male. Given Maimonides' hostility to all anthropomorphism, it should have been rejected, and in his lexigraphic treatment of anthropomorphic terms it is perhaps the most blatant omission. One may conclude, commonsensically I think, that the masculine generic was so reflexive and so unconscious as to be virtually invisible. On the other hand, one might conclude that Maimonides is committed to the figuration of God as sexually male, although this has the consequence of rendering the (male) philosopher an object of (an also male) God's sexual attentions. The sexual ambiguities of this scenario seem to me unremarkable; they point to a wholly traditional strain of homoeroticism in the history of religions, where theophanic ecstasy often seems the compensation for priestly asceticism.</page><page sequence="35">(1995) The Erotics of Negative Theology 35 apprehension is no longer a dispassionate matter of logic but in fact highly emotional, sexual, and, if we are to take his language seriously, "a kind of death." Maimonides insists that the Rabbis were merely speaking in metaphor when they mention kisses; they followed "the generally accepted poetical way of expression that calls the apprehension that is achieved in a state of intense and passionate love for Him ... a kiss." But while the kiss itself may be no more than metaphor, the passionate love and the death achieved in this final apprehension are not mere figuration. They are final elements of the philosopher's apprehension. "After having reached this condition of enduring permanence," Maimonides tells us, the "intellect remains in one and the same state, the impediment that sometimes screened him off [mavdil' having been removed. And he will remain permanently in that state of intense pleasure, which does not belong to the genus of bodily pleasures, as we have explained in our compilations and as others have explained before us."72 At the end of the Guide Maimonides has returned to the metaphor of corporeal obstruction - a screen that is at once the body and the external sense of the text. And, as Maimonides announced originally, this doubled- matter is the source of all perplexities and imperfections in the philosopher. We have discovered that the philosopher's perfection lies in apprehending God. While apprehension involves a metaphor of proximity, it cannot be physical proximity, since it is not even of "the genus of bodily pleasures." Apprehension is nonetheless a love superior to, and more absorbing and more passionate than, bodily love, and it is, Maimonides affirms, analogous to a kiss even while its intensity can lead to the lover's death. In reviewing the Maimonidean doctrine of attributes, we have seen how the radical transcendence of God seems to open an insuperable chasm between God and the philosopher. This chasm cannot be closed by means of everyday discursive reason. At the same time, a distinct cognitive state can be achieved in which the very process of negating discursivity has the paradoxical effect of bringing the philosopher closer to God. While ultimate knowledge is impossible, the process of negation can lead so near to God that the best analogy would be that God comes into physical and passionate contact. In that instant of pure apprehension the philosopher is overwhelmed with pleasure and separates entirely from his body. One can now see that the route leading from corporeal indulgence to textual misinterpretation - from the body of the philosopher to God's 72 MN. p. 628.</page><page sequence="36">36 Peter Eli Gordon JSQ 2 body - is not entirely a metaphorical relationship. It is a real and internal relationship, affirming that where bodily obstructions have been removed philosophical perfection can be achieved. The paradox is that Maimo- nides provides the reader with an unmistakably sexual description of this perfection, and we are left to struggle with the notion that apprehending God is like a sexual encounter without bodies. Philosophical apprehension spans but does not close the distance between God and the world; the final moment of apprehension seems to lift the philosopher out of the world. Nonetheless, even the most perfect apprehension is still not knowledge. Though it is the final result of discursive efforts, apprehension is not itself discursive. Though it relies upon a process of negation by means of language, it is not itself description; it is not a linguistic event at all. In this sense it is not at all surprising that Maimonides resorts to sexual metaphor. Reason and language have proven impotent, but apprehension is analogous to the nondiscursive union of lovers. Knowing through touching is like the private language of the body, and it is thus hasagah mada'ith - a knowing apprehension of God - but it is not the public language of ascription and description. To take sexual and bodily metaphor seriously in Maimonides is to invite raised eyebrows. It runs contrary to the whole spirit of his thought, since one of his central aims is the purging of figurative language from every page of the Bible. This essay has tried to show that even in the logical core of negative theology there are traces of religious experience that surpass proscription. Nor should the attention to sexual metaphor be seen as an effort to titillate the reader with the more accessible and less philosophical moments of a very difficult text. It is wholly consistent with Maimonides' efforts that hasagah finally assumes physical, sexual dimensions. The doctrine of negations leads to the margins of language. It suggests that our usual discursive path to knowledge will fail just at the point we desire it most to succeed; the nondiscursive knowing associated with sexuality therefore provides the most apt metaphor for philosophical apprehension. It is not primarily linguistic. It is much like Wittgenstein's impossible private language, since it may be recognizable but it does not consist in propositions. It is, we may conclude, incommunicable. But the encounter between the irreducible otherness of God and the philosopher involves some severe paradoxes, and my interpretation has tried to emphasize these paradoxes rather than avoid them. In the final analysis, apprehension of God is the summum bonum of the philosophical life and the chief aim of the Guide, but it is a difficult if not prohibitive task; it is recognition but not cognition, it is knowing without knowledge, and it is like the most</page><page sequence="37">(1995) The Erotics of Negative Theology 37 passionate and sexual union except that God has no body.73 It is, in short, eros without sexuality. When one recalls Rosenzweig's complaint, one can now see that there is an element of truth to his suggestion that theology cannot survive if its only activity is epistemological lamentation. Maimonides is indeed a philosopher preoccupied with the dissimilarity between God and the world, between the finitude of human thinking as against the unknowable infinitude of the divine. But this does not lead Maimonides to agnosticism. Instead, the celebrated via negativa becomes the beginning of philosophical practice, the whole purpose of which is to arrive at a limited apprehension of God. But we have also seen that Maimonides resorts to paradoxes and metaphorical circumlocutions so opaque they appear as poetic spasms in his otherwise well-tempered text. He affirms that the philosopher apprehends God through his inability to "attain the ultimate term in apprehending him," and he cites the wise paradox of the philosophers, "He is hidden from us because of the intensity with which He becomes manifest."74 Such language points to how discourse about God becomes tortured and of necessity falls short of its referent. But it does not indicate an end to religious experience. The most striking feature of Maimonides' negative theology is that it denies knowledge of God but affirms a more profound, non-discursive encounter. This positive doctrine of the Guide has often been obscured, but if it is not brought to light one misses a crucial aspect of Maimonides' thought, and one misunderstands altogether how utterly his thought is steeped in religious feeling.75 The inadequacy of the human intellect before God provides the beginning and not the end to Maimonides' religious philosophy; he creates a theory of human finitude that opens out onto a theory of religious experience. Maimonides decisively rejects what Rosenzweig called "epistemolog- ical lamentation," and the silence one finds at the summit of his philosophical project is not a variety of mystical experience. At the climax of the Guide to the Perplexed, the God of the philosophers becomes 73 This is different from Altmann's much more formal gloss that "our not knowing is knowing, docta ignorantia." See his "Maimonides on the Intellect and the Scope of Metaphysics." in Altmann, Von der mittelalterlichen zur modernen Aufklärung Op. cit. p. 122. 74 MN. p. 139. 75 This does not corroborate the opinion of Yeshayahu Leibowitz, who has bitterly criticized those who read Maimonides primarily as a philosopher but not as a proponent of halakhah. Leibowitz wants to skip lightly over Maimonides' most ambivalent statements regarding religious law and Talmudic study, both of which Maimonides at times seems to consider inferior to philosophy.

The purging of metaphor comes to a rest; mere talk will not do. Maimonides finally lets anthropomorphism and metaphor do their work, and willfully adopts the most striking and most intimate analogy. In the rich lexicon of human experience no better analogy could be found.</page></plain_text>
