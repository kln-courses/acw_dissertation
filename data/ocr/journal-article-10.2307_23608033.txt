Keelin McNab Anthropocentrism—a term that means a great deal to some, and is unfamiliar to others. The dictionary defines anthropocentrism as "regarding human beings as the centre of existence"; however, its implications are far more grave then this rather simple definition suggests.1 When applying this definition and considering the mindset that accompanies this idea to numerous cases of animal abuse, neglect, torture and murder performed daily, it becomes apparent that the beliefs associated with the term exist within cultures and societies around the world. What is truly appalling is that anthropocentrism is supported by a large percentage of the world's population, as a result of the idea that human beings are self-centred and do not need to concern themselves with the well-being of other creatures. The reality of the situation lies within the borders of numerous countries that have experienced the effects of war, either through internal conflict or through the training of soldiers for future battles. However, it is not important where the beliefs originate. The fact that ideas such as anthropocentrism are important issues within societies is disturbing, and damaging not only to the human race, but also to other forms of life. By applying the ideology of anthropocentrism to human military conflict, people are able to blindly utilize animals as allies and victims in war situations, without recognizing the impact of their actions on the animals. An examination of specific situations, as well as a discussion of the consequences that result from the involvement of animals in war, is necessary to comprehend the situation in its entirety. Historically, specific animals have been viewed as partners in the quest for military success. The horse, for example, has been used for transportation throughout historical times. As recently as Second World War, horses and soldiers were assembled into the "first Calvary Division, which formed in Palestine in 1940 with 8,000 horses."2 Soldiers used horses in order to increase their range of vision, by</page><page sequence="2">114 Keelin McNab allowing them to better understand the terrain or to quickly detect enemy attacks. In addition, the physical structure of horses that allowed speed and strength enabled soldiers to move across territory in reduced amounts of time. Human beings must understand that the animal did not choose to participate in the war; their involvement in the military battle was decided by the human beings. It is in this sense that anthropocentrism reflects human dominance and authority. However, the impact that the battle would have on the horses was never considered. In addition to horses, the military has used dogs, dolphins, camels, mules, elephants, pigeons, rabbits, chickens, turtles and goats. However, a distinction must be made between animals introduced into military situations as allies and those that entered as unwilling participants in training. Each animal was chosen for a purpose. Animals such as camels, mules, and elephants were exploited for their strength, endurance and their capacity to carry supplies.3 For example, the camel was an "ideal [animal] for the desert [because] they could carry heavy loads for long distances without food and water." Thousands of camels were exploited in World War II they "aided transport [of supplies] in Eritrea and Somaliland."4 Germany used dogs during World War I to sniff out mines and maintain soldiers' morale. Following suit, the United States of America established its own canine military training program.5 During World War II and the Vietnam War dogs proved to be reliable and versatile animals that could be trained to perform various tasks within a war situation. Dogs were glorified as soldiers' helpmates in war when medals were created in honour of their loyal service in the military. However, Doberman pinschers used in the Second World War were retired when no longer useful. A small majority of dogs were re-integrated into "normal" society and returned to their original civilian owners; others found homes with Marine handlers. Many, however, were simply destroyed when no permanent home could be found for them. This fact illustrated how anthropocentrism "excludes the "fair treatment" of animals.6 Besides canines, dolphins also function as allies within the American military. Dolphins entef military service when they are trained to be "parachuted into the sea, to plant mines and to kill divers with fitted devices."7 The military has exploited the intelligence and ability of the dolphins.</page><page sequence="3">Anthropocentrism: Are Humans the Centre of Existence 115 It must first be realized that animals used by the Unites States navy are captured. This alone appears to present a contradiction: the human race enslaves an innocent being eliminating its freedom to secure the freedom of other beings. Beyond the way in which dolphins become soldiers, their missions illustrate the lack of value placed upon these animals' lives. It was discovered early last year that the Soviet navy had trained dolphins to "attack enemy frogmen with harpoons attached to their backs and carry out kamikaze strikes against enemy ships."8 Kamikaze missions alter the classification of the dolphins within the military, from allies to victims. In 1998 "twenty-two striped dolphins found on French beaches... carried a gaping circular wound to their necks." The U.S. navy had used them as "commandos trained to neutralize human divers and even place limpet mines on enemy craft." When they escaped their squads, they were considered traitors and executed so that it was not possible for this "hi-tech underwater weaponry [to] fall into enemy hands."9 When human beings place themselves in positions of superiority, they view the world as nothing more then "a collection of objects, each amenable to study and control."10 We are only mildly dismayed to hear that a refugee family encountered "streets full of dead and mutilated livestock animals. Some had their legs hacked off and were still alive."11 However, there are people who believe that animals have emotions and spirits. They subscribe to anthropomorphism, "the attribution of human characteristics to a god, animal or thing."12 When this belief is taken to an extreme, tragic consequences may result. One such situation occurred during the ethnic "conflict" in Kosovo. The Albanian Muslims gouged out the eyes of an ox because the animal belonged to a sisterhood of Serbian nuns.13 The core reason behind the exploitation of the animals in war and in peacetime is the belief that using any means necessary is acceptable when attempting to achieve one's goals. This idea is fully applied not only to the use of torture, violence, slander against humans but also to the cruelties to animals within a war situation. Anthropocentrism assumes that fear, anger, pain or long-term effects visited upon animals may be disregarded. As a matter of fact humans in their military training are desensitized as to animal sensation. This is illustrated by some training exercises of U.S. soldiers. Members of the Massachusetts National Guard are instructed to "pull the heads off live chickens as part of a survival training exercise called 'rites of passage'"; such training is said to "prepare a soldier to fight in today's modern battlefield"14 by teaching them how</page><page sequence="4">116 Keelin McNab to perform malicious acts and not feel guilt afterwards. Such training prepares the soldiers to believe that as superior species humans have the right to use animals as props in training and as allies or victims in war. Millions of innocent animals are maimed, tortured, or murdered as a result of decisions made by humans—a fact which merely illustrates the value, or lack of value, placed upon their lives. It is therefore important to reconsider the implications of anthropocentrism, which establishes many values in our culture, and in other cultures in the world. NOTES 1. Barber, Katherine, ed.
