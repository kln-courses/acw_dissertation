<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TODAS. By W. H. R. RIVERS, Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge. Macmillan and Co. 1906. Price 2IS. net. IN this account of the Todas of the Nilgiri Hills in Southern India Dr. Rivers has given us not only an elaborate description of a singularly interesting people, but has supplied a model of anthropological investigation on truly scientific lines. When it is remembered that his visit to their country occupied only five months, and that being ignorant of their language he was dependent upon the services of interpreters, the amount and accuracy of the information which he has collected testify to the energy and tactfulness with which his enquiries were conducted. He fully admits that in many directions his information is still incomplete. In fact, the impression which his book leaves upon me is that, as in the case of all anthropological investigations in India, and for that matter among all savage and semi-savage races, the Toda reserves a forbidden chamber in his brain, in which the secrets of his beliefs and cults are still jealously guarded. Unless this fact be admitted, many of the facts recorded in this monograph are still to a large extent unintelligible. Whether the veil which shrouds the tribal mysteries will ever be raised it is impossible to say. But with the experience which Dr. Rivers has already gained no one at present is likely to be able to push the investigation a step further, and in the interests of ethnological research it is to be hoped that he may be given the opportunity</page><page sequence="2">Reviews. I0o3 of revisiting his Toda friends, of acquiring a working knowledge of their language, and of exploring still further the beliefs and usages of this mysterious people. I can only touch here upon a few salient features of interest in a book which must lie on the shelves of all working anthrop- ologists. First, as to the origin of the Todas. Differences of cults and rites within the tribe itself seem to indicate that they reached their present settlement on the Nilgiri plateau by at least two successive migrations. Many lines of evidence tend to show that their original home was on the west coast in Malabar, and the process of development of their beliefs, ritual, and institutions suggests that they must have remained in a state of comparative isolation from their neighbours for a considerable period of time. How far they may be connected with the people who erected the remarkable stone monuments still remains uncertain. Next, as to their religion. They worship a pantheon of definitely anthropomorphic beings, who are believed to have lived in the world before man existed. Most of these seem to be hill spirits, each occupying a peak of its own, all of which have on their summits the stone circles, cairns, and barrows which were excavated by Breeks and others. This suggests a connexion with the dolmen-builders; but at the same time it is noteworthy that the Todas seem to have little respect for these monuments, and do not object to their excavation. Besides these hill-spirits many of their gods are deified mortals, men raised to the rank of deities not as the result of ancestor worship but of a hero cult. There is nothing to show that these gods are personifications of the forces of nature; there is no phallic worship, and no indication of totemism. None of these gods are visible to mortals, and most of them are losing any reality which they may once have possessed. To quote Dr. Rivers' summary: "The idea of 'god' is highly developed among the Todas, and I am inclined to believe that the most satisfactory explanation of the Toda deities is that the people came to the Nilgiri Hills with a body of highly developed gods; that round these gods have clustered various legends connected with the Toda institutions; that these old gods have gradually through long ages lost their reality; that certain heroes</page><page sequence="3">Io04 Reviews. have been raised to the ranks of gods, and that the lives of their heroes, founded to some extent on actual fact, have more interest to the Todas and are remembered and passed on, while the legends of the older gods are gradually becoming vaguer in the process towards complete oblivescence; that the gods as a whole, however, are still regarded as the authors of punishment, and that there is a tendency to make an abstraction of the power of the gods." At present ritual persists in tropical luxuriance, while the beliefs at the basis of the ritual have largely disappeared. The wearisome round of ceremonies intended to secure the purity of the officiant, and the ring of taboos which encompasses him, remind us of the frivolities of the Hindu Brahmana literature. In fact, as Dr. Rivers clearly shows, the Todas are Hindus by race and have been profoundly affected by Hindu influence, direct, or indirect through neighbouring tribes like the Badagas. The tale of woman being formed out of the rib of man suggests that while resident on the western coast they may have absor'bed some Christian or Jewish beliefs. At present the cult of the buffalo is the most prominent feature of their religion. It is perhaps possible that, as suggested by Dr. Rivers, they may have brought with them some animal cultus, like the Hindu reverence for the cow, from their original home in Malabar; and that in their new settlement "the religion of the Todas underwent a very special development, its ritual coming to centre more and more round the buffalo, because in their very simple environment this was the most accessible object of veneration." This explanation, though perhaps the most reasonable which can be offered at present, is far from satisfactory. No other Dravidian buffalo cult seems as yet to have been dis- covered. But we know little of the primitive tribes of Southern India, and some day Mr. Thurston may explain the mystery. The cult of the bell is almost equally mysterious. Dr. Rivers suggests that it may have come about by a process of transference from the buffalo to the object worn by it. "Probably at one time the buffaloes were more directly venerated than they appear to be at present." This, again, seems very doubtful. The Gonds, who have no buffalo cult, worship a bell-god as Ghagarapen, and this may easily have arisen from a belief in the sanctity of the bell</page><page sequence="4">Reviews. o05 or rattle carried by the medicine man to scare evil spirits, a sanctity later on extended to the bell and shell trumpet of the Hindu temple. With the most elaborate chapters of Dr. Rivers' book I cannot deal here-the complete account of the rites connected with the sacred dairy and its officiant; the rites performed at birth, marriage, and death; and last but not least the description of the tribal organisation. In this last department Dr. Rivers has adopted and still further developed the system of recording genealogies, an invention of his own, used with singular success in his investigation of the people of Murray Island, and here applied with no less valuable results to the sociology of a small, isolated tribe. All these chapters supply novel facts which must be taken into account by all students of primitive races. On the whole, it is safe to regard this monograph on the Todas as one of the most important recent contributions to Indian ethnology. It is no proof of the failure of his mission that much work still remains to be done. On the contrary, the energy and tact applied to the survey of a very reticent, suspicious race are no less admirable than the scientific forms in which the results of his visit have been summarised, and the modesty which has saved the author from rash generalisation and haphazard comparison of Toda beliefs and customs with those of the races by whom they are surrounded.
