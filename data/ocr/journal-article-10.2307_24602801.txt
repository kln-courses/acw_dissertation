Honan (in 4); and others of Ma-ch'ang type from near Lanchow in Kansu (in 6). An article in 4 by Wu Chen 爱震 argues against the contention (made in 1956, 6) that Shang face-down burials indicate a slave status; in his opinion no explanation is yet possible. Late Chou finds were as usual richest at Changsha. Among other objects belonging to now familiar categories, we meet in 5 a set of earthenware vessels closely modelled in their forms and decoration on inlaid bronzes. A paper in 1 by Li Cheng-kuang 奢正尤 analyzes the typology of Changsha bronze mirrors. Another in 4 by Yu Chieh 子懷 discusses Warring States tomb types in general. Still another summary analysis, by Yang Tsung-jung 揚宗榮 in 6, deals with the variety of decorative tile-heads found on the site of the Yen state's “lower capital" in Hopei; continuing in this the study begun in the war years by Sekino Takeshi. Among the very numerous Han remains a few published in 4 merit special mention. The Shan-hsien campaign previously referred to uncovered pottery “watch-tower’’ models of exceptional elaboration, along with lamp and incense stands fantastically shaped and decorated in high relief. Attention is called to a unique wooden model boat with flat, cut-out oarsmen, in type unlike those previously found at Changsha, which comes from a wood-framed Former Han burial near Canton. Explorations in the T'ung-shan^^ 山 area of Kiangsu disclosed additional stone tombs with large figured wall slabs; three at fairly large scale, though ruinous and with their roofs gone. Some of the carved stones recall the more elaborate Wu slabs in themes and composi tions, though executed in a somewhat different style. Those from another tomb feature large figures 一 human, beast, or monstrous 一 rendered with great expressiveness; these recall I-nan, but are superior in drawing. Finally a brick tomb near Sian, placed at the end of Han or later by its mirrors, coins, and centralized plan type yielded an extraordinary naked and winged bronze figurine of a child which seems distantly derived from an Eros type. Among the papers dealing with subjects from this period should be noticed: in 4, a collection of iconographical studies of the themes found on Szechwan tomb tiles, by Yu Hao-liang 于裹亮；in 2, a criticism by An Chih-min 髮志勒_of the 1955 publication of the Wang-tu painted tomb (see RBS 1，No. 228)，as being too "arty", to the neglect of archaeological completeness. An adds his opinion that the deceased must have been Sun Ch'eng潘避，Marquis of Fou-yang ミ拿陽，who died in a.d. 132. Two criticisms of the monumental I-nan publication of 1956 (see RBS 2, No. 321) appear in 6. Li Wen-hsin 来文# attempts to revise the dating by a century</page><page sequence="3">408] ARCHÉOLOGIE, ART ET ÉPIGRAPHIE 165 or so, from the editors' “late Later Han’’ to Western Chin, arguing his case by pointing to details of dress, utensils, furniture, etc., that in his opinion came into use only in the Wei kingdom or the Chin. Sun Tso-yiin 接作愛 complains of the editors' failure to give sufficient emphasis to what seem to him the two main themes in the I-nan decorative scheme: first, winged immortals, symbolizing the hope of ascent to Heaven; and second, the no^_ exorcism rite, performed by masked witch-doctors to drive away demons and noxious creatures. The most interesting Six Dynasties finds were made at Ching-hsien M lâ in SE. Hopei, by a team attempting to recover objects plundered by local peasants from the cemetery of the historically important Feng 圭才 clan (reported in 3). Tomb necrologies (mu-chih 墓就）inscribed on stones identified the tombs of three members of the clan given prominence in the Wei shu and Pei CKi shu，who were buried at the site in 521, 545, and 564; the wife of the second of these was later interred with him in 589, and that of the third in 583. The burial objects reassembled by the team include finely made vessels of green tfu stoneware, other vessels or utensils of bronze and glass, and an exceptionally rich collection of pottery figurines; unfortunately it is not clear how these last were divided between the tombs opened, and so how they may be dated. By the villagers' account, the tombs broken into were all built of brick and tunnel-vaulted on oblong plans. A Sui tomb outside of Wuhan city (in 6), datable by its wu-chu coins, is interesting both for its numerous and animated figurines, and for the wall treatment of the coffin chamber: into the side walls were set tiles representing the Green Dragon and White Tiger, while small square recesses held anthropomorphic figures of the Twelve Branches. Two T'ang tombs (in 5), the earlier at Ch'ang chih 長洽 in Shansi dated 679 and the later at Sian dated 745, also yielded important sets of figurines that illustrate vividly the changes in costume, ideal physical proportions, and sculptural style that took place in this crucial interval. The Sian tomb in addition showed traces of wall painting: the traditional musicians and dancers, and a seated figure perhaps representing the deceased; while the stone coffin platform proved to be decorated with a design of rampant lions among peony blossoms. Among the relatively few later finds reported should be mentioned a group of YUan tombs in Hua-yang 牵陽，Szechwan, which yielded a number of rather coarsely realistic figurines (in 5); and a Ming family cemetery outside of Lanchow, centering on the tomb of the high official P'eng Tse 彭澤 (1460-1531). His extremely long tomb necrology begins with a finely inscribed preamble in the seal character, with a bust-length frontal portrait engraved below. With him was buried a bronze mirror, which as a poor photograph and a vague description suggest, may be an archaistic imitation of the T'ang lion-and-grape-scroll type. From the coffins of the wives were recovered a charming headdress and other items of personal adornment.</page><page sequence="4">166 REVUE BIBLIOGRAPHIQUE DE SINOLOGIE 3, ANNÉE 1957 [409-410 Finally it may be noted that the beginning of a new policy, also in archaeo logy, is signalized in 5 and 6 with the first personal attacks on the noted paleographer and bronze specialist, Ch'en Meng-chia. In addition to a general obstinacy in resisting Party domination, he is more specifically charged here with opposing the official reform of the script, and with criti cizing the scholarship of his senior, Kuo Mo-jo.
