It is argued that (with some modification) Lockwood's conceptualisation is logically more congruent and heuristically more useful than that of the other two theorists. Key words : social and system integration, contradiction, conflict, System/lifeworld, micro/macro. The social-/system-integration distinction has been a useful tool in the empirical investigation of social transformation.1 The various attempts to change or transcend this by now famous dichotomy relate it to some key debates in sociological theory, such as the status of functionalist explanations, the links between subjectivist and objectivist sociologies, the issue of essen- tialist accounts of social phenomena, etc. In the present article I focus on how Habermas (1987) and Giddens (1984) have tried to restructure Lockwood's (1964) distinction, and argue that their attempts have not been very successful and that it is more useful to retain Lockwood's original formulation (with some modifications). Lockwood For Lockwood (1964:244-56), the social-/system-integration distinction sen- sitises the student to two different ways of viewing social wholes; in turn, these two different perspectives lead to different mechanisms accounting for social order or disorder. Social integration refers to 'the orderly or conflictual relationships between the actors' whereas system integration focuses on the compatible or incompatible/contradictory relationships between 'the parts of the social system'. Looking at a social whole from the point of view of actors and their relationships leads to investigating the problem of social order/disorder in terms of social co-operation/conflict. These are the result of the actors - on the basis of how they conceive the social world - developing strategies for defending or promoting what they consider to be their interests. On the level of system integration, the focus shifts from an agency to a systemic perspective. It is no longer the actors who occupy centre stage, but 'system parts'. Lockwood considers that Parsonian functionalists view systemic parts in institutional terms. More specifically, in Parsons's subdivision of the societal</page><page sequence="2">112 NICOS MOUZELIS system into four subsystems (adaptation, goal achievement, integration and latency - AGIL for short), systemic parts are institutions: economic institu- tions (A), political institutions (G), legal institutions (I) and kinship/religious institutions (L). It follows that the problem of social order/disorder is a matter of how congruous or incongruous certain complexes of institutionalised values/norms are with each other. For instance, in several late-developing countries, traditional patriarchal norms concerning female conduct in the latency subsystem may clash with more individualistic normative expectations in the rapidly industrialising adaptation subsystem.2 But for Lockwood, incompatibilities between systemic parts can also take a different form. If one looks at system integration/disintegration from a Marxist perspective, such incompatibilities take a normative/non-normative or institutional-core/material-substratum form. Or, as expressed in his more recent work (Lockwood 1992), the difference is between a normative and a factual order: a de jure state of affairs, where values/norms regulate social conduct by defining the rights and obligations of each social role -thus leading to the constitution of a stable status hierarchy; and a de facto situation, where social conduct is primarily shaped in non-normative, utilitarian fashion by the differential control and distribution of resources within and outside the economic sphere. (The former dimension is theorised chiefly by the Durkheimian sociological tradition, the latter by Marxism.) While Lockwood is correct in putting this particular type of systemic incompatibility at the centre of a theory of societal transformation, the way he conceptualises the two incompatible systemic parts creates serious difficulties. With regard to the normative/non-normative distinction, however one defines (for instance) the forces of production in Marxist theory, they obviously do entail norms, such norms portraying varying degrees of institutionalisation (Mouzelis 1991:53-9, 1993). Moreover, when Lockwood conflates the non- normative with the utilitarian, that too creates ambiguity, since utilitarian action, as Lockwood himself admits, entails the norm of 'rationality' (1992: 357-8). Similar difficulties arise when the distinction is expressed - as it was in Lockwood's earlier formulation - in terms of an institutional core and a material substratum. This would imply that the latter does not entail institu- tionalised norms, that it is somehow ontologically different from the former. One way of avoiding the essentialist connotations of the above position is to reject the manner in which Lockwood conceptualises systemic incom- patibilities. If one starts from the premise that all system parts entail normative regulation, then there are no system parts that are 'non-normative'. System parts always refer to institutionalised complexes of norms/roles. This is true whether one looks at such institutional complexes as kinship, law and religion, or at science, technology and private property. All of the above refer to institutions; and if this is so, then system contradictions of both the Marxist and the Parsonian variety always reflect incompatibilities between institutions,</page><page sequence="3">SOCIAL AND SYSTEM INTEGRATION 113 i.e. incompatibilities between the various kinds of logic of different institutionalised complexes of norms/roles. Accepting the above premise does not necessarily entail rejecting Marx's insight that certain systemic parts are, so to speak, more durable, less 'malleable' as far as their change or transformation is concerned. But this varying malleability or durability of institutionalised complexes of norms/roles can be expressed without using the essentialist material/non-material dis- tinction. It could be argued, for instance, that certain institutions are less malleable, harder to change, because powerful interest groups support them in a more or less purposive manner. Needless to say, since institutions should not be conceptualised as reified anthropomorphic entities, the prevalence of the logic in less malleable institu- tional complexes over that of the more malleable ones does not come about automatically. It always entails struggles on the social-integration level of analysis, i.e. on the level of actors, their strategies and the unanticipated con- sequences of these strategies. In other words, as Lockwood has correctly argued, system contradictions do not result automatically in social trans- formation. In order to assess whether or not systemic incompatibilities lead to social change, and/or to see what type of change, one has to focus on how actors handle contradictions: how conscious they are of incompatibilities between institutions, what they do in order to maintain or change the contradictory status quo, etc. Take, for instance, the growing contradiction in present-day Britain between the productivity and competitiveness logic in the institutional sphere of the economy, and what Parsons (Parsons and Piatt 1973) has called the logic of cognitive rationality in the sphere of higher education. In view of the prevailing balance of political and social forces since the 1974 world economic crisis, it is not surprising that the more malleable educational institutions have been colonised, to use Habermas's expression, by the less malleable, economic ones. This colonisation, which took the form of the gradual dis- placement of the academic by the managerial logic in British universities, did not occur automatically. It entailed strategies of colonisation and resistance to colonisation by a variety of interest groups in and outside academia. A final point about the varying malleability of institutional complexes. Following Weber's critique of Marx's historic materialism, one should stress that it is impossible to argue in a transcultural, transhistorical, universal manner that certain institutions (e.g. economic) are always less malleable than others (e.g. religion, kinship). The degree of malleability of all institutions is an empirical question; it cannot be decided in an armchair, aprioristic manner by the construction of such misleading dichotomies as material base/ superstructure. To conclude this section, if one accepts the above, social integration refers to co-operative/conflictual relationships between actors, whereas system integration refers to compatibilities/incompatibilities between 'parts' that are</page><page sequence="4">114 NICOS MOUZELIS always viewed as institutionalised complexes portraying different degrees of durability/malleability. With this modification the social-/system-integration distinction becomes consistently analytical - leading to a view of the same social phenomena from two different perspectives. From the social-integration perspective the focus is on concrete actors and their relations/interactions in time and space. From the system-integration perspective the focus shifts to institutional complexes as a virtual order of rules/norms which, in Giddens's terminology, are instantiated only when actors draw upon them in order to act or interact in specific situations. To use an expression from linguistics, social integration refers to the syntagmatic level (concrete interactions in time- space), and system integration to the paradigmatic level (logical com- patibilities/incompatibilities between rules outside time and space).3 Habermas In adopting the social-/system-integration distinction, Habermas retains Lockwood's agency/system perspective. Social integration refers to an 'inter- nalist', agency-oriented view of the social world, whereas system integration points to an 'externalist' perspective that 'reaches through and beyond action orientations'. It is the view of an observer who examines social orientations/ actions not from the point of view of the actors involved, but from that of the system and its functional requirements for maintenance and reproduction (Habermas 1987:117). Given this agency/functionalist perspective, when Habermas tackles the problem of social order he distinguishes two action co-ordinating mechanisms. From the point of view of social integration, action co-ordination is based on 'a normatively secured or communicatively achieved consensus'; whereas on the level of system integration, co-ordination is based on the systemic steering media of money and power that regulate actions more or less 'automatically'. In this latter case, action co-ordination is assured by systemic mechanisms operating behind the actors' backs so to speak, i.e. by mechanisms necessi- tating neither normatively reached agreements nor mutual understanding (1987:1 17ff). The third step in Habermas's formulation consists of using Parsons' AGIL scheme to link system-integration mechanisms of co-ordination with what he calls the System (the adaptation and goal-achievement subsystems), and social-integration mechanisms with the lifeworld (which corresponds to Parsons's integration and latency subsystems). Adopting an evolutionary framework, the German social philosopher argues that in primitive societies there is no clear differentiation between social- and system-integration mechanisms of action co-ordination. Then, as societies become more complex, a differentiation does develop between System and lifeworld, and modern societies show a clear differentiation</page><page sequence="5">SOCIAL AND SYSTEM INTEGRATION 115 between the economic, political, social and cultural institutional spheres, systemic steering media co-ordinating action in the spheres of the market (A) and the state (G). Meanwhile, in the remaining spheres, as traditional norms decline, 'problem areas' or areas of uncertainty emerge, where action co- ordination is achieved on the basis of communicative rationality. From this perspective, modernity's pathology consists of the lifeworld being colonised by steering media that are 'appropriate' only to the economic and political spheres. As traditional normative regulations recede, communicative co- ordination is replaced by steering-media co-ordination, resulting in a de- humanisation of the lifeworld (1987:163ff). This third step, by which Habermas links mechanisms of co-ordination with specific institutional spheres (e.g. steering media with Parsons's A and G subsystems), leads away from the initial formulation by Lockwood, for whom the internalist/externalist or social-/system-integration perspective, and the appropriate mechanisms that this perspective entails (conflict, contradiction), apply to all institutional spheres. Whether he examines an economic enter- prise, a public bureaucracy, a religious organisation, or a family group, Lockwood can look at all these social wholes (and their problems of order/ disorder) from both a social- and a system-integration point of view: both in terms of agency (mechanisms of conflict/co-operation), and in systemic, functionalist terms (compatibilities/incompatibilities between institutionalised parts or sub-parts). For Habermas this is no longer the case, since the externalist perspective is systematically linked with not only steering media of co-ordination, but also with the A and G subsystems. This creates problems, for the simple reason that the conflation of a methodological distinction (internalist, externalist pers- pective) with a substantive one (steering media co-ordinate the System , i.e. the economic and political institutional spheres) engenders a great deal of con- fusion.4 It leads to the assumption that the externalist/functionalist perspective is appropriate only for the study of the economic and political subsystems, and the internalist perspective for the study of the lifeworld (I and L subsystems). This is patently not so because, as Habermas himself has admitted (1987:311), communicative forms of co-ordination do play a role not only in the lifeworld but also in the adaptation and goal-achievement subsystems. Of course, Habermas may defend his position by arguing that in the latter cases the co-ordinating role of communicative understanding is peripheral or subordinate to that played by the steering media. This is an empirically open question, however, given that the importance of the non-steering media in the economy and polity may vary from case to case - being extremely crucial, for instance, in industrial relations negotiations (Mouzelis 1991:179fï). Quite irrespective of the above consideration, however, labelling the A and G subsystems as the System and the I and L ones as lifeworld builds into the very definition of these two terms, and therefore solves aprioristically, the</page><page sequence="6">116 NICOS MOUZELIS substantive, empirical issue of how important steering and non-steering mechanisms of co-ordination are in each institutional sphere. In that sense it may lead to the false impression that one cannot study economic and political institutions from the point of view of the lifeworld of economic and political subjects. In other words, it gives the false impression that there are no economic or political lifeworlds. To sum up this argument, Lockwood's perspectivism (i.e. his distinction between an agency and a systemic perspective) is logically congruent with the mechanisms of integration he posits: co-operation/conflict is linked with the agency perspective, and compatibilities/incompatibilities with a systemic pers- pective. By contrast, Habermas's perspectivism (i.e. his internalist/externalist distinction) is logically incongruent with his mechanisms of co-ordination because, quite inappropriately, he locates steering-media co-ordination within economic and political institutions, and communicative mechanisms of co- ordination within the remaining institutional spheres. Giddens With Giddens (1984), finally, the social-/system-integration distinction moves even further away from Lockwood's original formulation. Given that Giddens's structuration theory aims at transcending the subjectivist-objectivist divide in the social sciences, he rejects the agency/system or internalist/ externalist distinction, and tries to use the social-/system-integration concepts as a substitute for the micro/macro perspective in the social sciences. For Giddens, social integration entails mechanisms bringing about reci- procity of actors' conduct £in circumstances of co-presence, understood as continuities in and disjunctions of encounters'; whereas system integration refers to 'reciprocity between actors or collectivities across extended time- space, outside conditions of co-presence' (1984:376-7). This means that co- presence or face-to-face encounters entail social integration (i.e. processes of reciprocity not extending considerably in time-space), whereas absence of co- presence is linked to system integration (i.e. processes of reciprocity that do extend across time-space). As in the case of Habermas, Giddens's formulation again creates serious difficulties. His micro/macro or rather restricted/extended time-space concept is not logically compatible with his reciprocity-achieving mechanisms. More precisely, when Giddens links a 'restricted' time-space perspective with co- presence or face-to-face encounters, he does not take into account the very simple fact that face-to-face encounters may entail macro rather than micro processes of reciprocity. So the face-to-face encounter between heads of state may well lead to agreements that achieve reciprocity between actors or collectivities across extended time-space. Linking the extended time-space perspective to lack of co-presence is plainly wrong, therefore. Giddens here</page><page sequence="7">SOCIAL AND SYSTEM INTEGRATION 117 reproduces a misconception that is quite common among micro-sociologists who link face-to-face interactions with the micro level of analysis (Mouzelis 1991:194-200). Another difficulty with Giddens 's reformulation of the social-/system- integration distinction is that his 'transcendence' of the subjectivist-objectivist divide is really only decorative. He in fact reintroduces Habermas's internalist/ externalist and Lockwood's agency/system perspective when he coins yet another distinction: between 'institutional analysis' and 'analysis in terms of strategic conduct' (1984:288). Institutional analysis corresponds more or less exactly to how Lockwood uses system integration, and strategic-conduct analysis corresponds to Lockwood's social-integration perspective. With his new distinction Giddens merely reintroduces the subjectivist- objectivist divide he tried to transcend in the first place. Its reintroduction, by the back door, so to speak, was quite inevitable. Giddens, an accomplished sociological analyst, was not prepared to pay the price that total abolition of this fundamental conceptual divide entails. The only effective way of trans- cending the subjectivist-objectivist dichotomy would be to move in a post- structuralist direction: to de-centre the subject and view the social world as a flat, non-hierarchised chain or network of disembodied and 'subjectless' prac- tices or discourses. This peripheralisation of actors, as Foucault's work clearly shows, leads either to the impossibility of moving from description to explanation, or to teleological accounts of social phenomena (Mouzelis 1995: 45-69). In the light of the above, and viewing the overall differences between Lockwood, Habermas, and Giddens, it can be argued that Lockwood's conceptualisation of the social- system-integration distinction is the most successful of the three. This is the case because in Lockwood's formulation there is logical congruence between his perspectivism (i.e. his notion that one can view a social system from both an agency and a systemic perspective), and the mechanisms of action co-ordination that he sees as corresponding to each perspective: conflict/co-operation is linked to the agency, social-integration perspective, and logical compatibility/incompatibility with that of system integration. This congruence is missing in Habermas's formulation since, as already argued, he limits in aprioristic manner the social, internalist perspective, and the normative/communicative media which correspond to it, to only certain institutional spheres (I, L) and denies it to others (A, G). This limitation is both logically and empirically wrong. As for Giddens, here too there is a basic logical incongruence between his perspectivism (social integration referring to a micro, and system integration to a macro pers- pective) and the mechanisms of action co-ordination that correspond to each perspective: reciprocity based on co-presence corresponding to the micro, social-integration approach, and reciprocity not based on co-presence corres- ponding to the macro-system-integration one. The logical incoherence here arises from the fact that reciprocity based on co-presence, as a mechanism of</page><page sequence="8">118 NICOS MOUZEUS action co-ordination, is not limited, as Giddens implies, to the micro, social- integration level of analysis. Conclusion Lockwood's distinction between social and system integration points to two fundamental ways of looking at the social world (agency and system perspectives). These in turn point to two mechanisms useful for under- standing social order and disorder: co-operation/conflict between actors, and compatibility/incompatibility between institutions. If Lockwood's notion of a contradiction between substratum and institutional core is translated as systemic contradiction between more and less durable institutional complexes, then this distinction exhibits a logical consistency that is missing in its subsequent modifications by Habermas and Giddens. Habermas's reformulation of the social-/system-integration distinction retains Lockwood's agency/system perspective (internalist/externalist), but the mechanisms of integration he derives from this perspective are, in rather confusing manner, linked with specific institutional spheres (systemic steering media with the economy and polity, and non-steering media with the rest). Giddens rejects Lockwood's and Habermas's internalist/externalist pers- pective in his endeavour to transcend the objectivist-subjectivist divide in the social sciences. To do so he uses the social-/system-integration distinction to identify two types of reciprocity between actors, corresponding to restricted (micro) and extended (macro) time-space distantiation. He is not very successful. Not only is his linkage of co-presence with restricted time-space problematical, but he also has to bring back Lockwood's initial distinction in the guise of a somewhat different terminology (as analysis in terms of strategic conduct and institutional analysis). Notes 1. For an example of such an application see Mouzelis 1990:93-157. 2. For a discussion of Parsons 's AGIL scheme along such lines, see Mouzelis 1995:81-100. 3. Although Lockwood is not directly concerned with it, another type of systemic contradiction that is expressed problematically is the one between a durable institution (say private ownership of the means of production) and institu- tionalised discourses trying to analyse, explain, criticise, or legitimate that institution. Marxists usually assign the former (let us call it P) to the material base, and the latter (I) to the ideological superstructure. Here also, the intuitive notion that P is more solid, less malleable than I is quite useful. But the way in which the P-I relationship is expressed, in terms of material versus ideal, creates more problems than it solves, particularly in a post-positivist, anti-essentialist phase in the social sciences, where the emphasis is on the discursive and symbolic construction of the social. How can one translate the material/ideal distinction into non-essentialist terms? By differentiating between first - and second-order</page><page sequence="9">SOCIAL AND SYSTEM INTEGRATION 119 discourses . Whether one looks at economic, political, religious or kinship institutions, one will find first-order discursive practices through which lay persons, on a recursive basis, reproduce key institutions, and second-order dis- cursive practices that may be conceptualised as attempts by specialists to understand, criticise, legitimate, defend these institutions. Both first- and second-order discourses entail interpretations or theories. The basic difference between them is that the latter are 'theories about theories', second-order interpretations about the first-order interpretations that millions of lay persons use in their everyday interactions in the market place. Now although second- order discursive practices significantly influence first-order ones and vice-versa , there is a sense in which the former are 'softer', more malleable than first-order practices. To take again our previous example, in non-revolutionary circum- stances it is easier to change I than P. It is easier, for instance, in a stable capitalist society to change the theories social scientists hold about private property than to change the actual institution of private property as a set of first- order discourses of millions of buyers and sellers. 4.
