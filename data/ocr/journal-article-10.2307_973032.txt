<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Franklin D. Roosevelt and inspired by Profes- sor Merriam. III THROUGHOUT the work occur wise insights. We draw attention to a few. It may be said roughly that the prestige of govern- ment has suffered most from the tradition of violence and from hereditary transmission of authority. Im- patience and incompetence were encouraged by these factors (p. 71). Nevertheless, the process of prevention, the rule of management without force, is in its way. The general principle of prevention has been accepted and the details of management are in course of development. A shot in the arm even takes the place of a strait jacket (p. 79). Any school child can furnish information as to how to tease the teacher within the law (p. 81). Conciliar bodies perform a useful function in pro- viding for participation of many elements in the shap- ing of decisions of general interest. Being consulted is an important part of affairs, both public and private. Not being consulted is in reverse one of the most common sources of trouble. Even the absolute ruler may well consult his subjects as does the modern boss about many matters of common concern (p. 136). To what aspects of state activity is the ballot most cearly applicable? "What is justiciable?" the lawyers ask. "What is votable?" the statesman may inquire (p. 229). How to reconcile flaming party spirit in the conduct of campaigns and a spirit of compromise afterward is not an easy accomplishment for the inexperienced; and, indeed, to some this may seem the high point in insincerity and hypocrisy. But as in organized sport we do not aim to kill or maim our opponents but only to surpass them in a given play, so in party warfare the aim is not the death of opponents but their relegation to political inefficiency for the time. . . . The de- feated partisan does not resort to assassination and revolution but accepts the verdict as the voice of the community for the moment. The minority party pro- ceeds to devise ways and means of altering that verdict on the first possible occasion. All this really rests upon confidence in the justice of the community, finally expressed in a deferred verdict (p. 233). The greatest of all revolutions in the whole history of mankind is the acceptance of creative evolution as the proper role of man, for this will eventually transform the spirit and the institutions of education, of industry, and of government, opening a broad way to the realization of the highest and finest values of human life, in a form of association where leaders no longer scream and curse and threaten and where men no longer shuffle, cringe, and fear but stand erect in dignity and liberty and speak with calm voices of what clear eyes may see. Free men-in free states-in a free world-these the future government may bring (p. 345). Professor Merriam promises more books. May they come. This is a masterpiece and a liberal education for those who like to think. We await his counsel on The Bomb and, in view of what he has already said, are not afraid of it. Road to Gethsemane By Rowland Egger, University of Virginia THE INTERNATIONAL SECRETARIAT: A GREAT EXPERIMENT IN INTERNATIONAL ADMINISTRA- TION, by EGON F. RANSHOFEN-WERTHEIMER. Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1945. Pp. xxvii, 500. $4.50. THE INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION OF AN INTER- NATIONAL SECRETARIAT, by CHESTER PURVES. Royal Institute of International Affairs, 1945. Pp. 78. 4s. 6d. AS THE nations of the world move forward into perhaps the final opportunity which will be permitted them to establish a working peace system, the problem of supranational administration is beginning to occupy a large place on the stage of international affairs. The experience of the League of Nations, both good and bad, is being restudied with great care. As General Smuts remarked at San Francisco. "It was a great and noble effort, much in advance of anything that has been done or even at- tempted before. Today it is the fashion to be- little or even sneer at the League of Nations. But in its day it registered a real and great advance, and those either in this country or elsewhere who labored in that noble cause have nothing to regret or apologize for." Ac- tually, the League and the International Labor Office represent practically the sum total of our experience in large-scale international ad- ministration. Those who are deeply and sin- cerely concerned with the success of supra- national government will not allow the anathema which has attached to the League in certain sectors of international political opinion to lead them into the tragic error of 71</page><page sequence="2">PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW cavalierly casting aside the great administra- tive lessons that may be learned from the his- tory of the League. These two completely different studies based upon the experience of the League each con- stitute, in their special ways, significant con- tributions to the literature of supranational administration. Both have been written from a background of rich administrative experi- ence in the League secretariat, and from this they derive much of their value and many of their limitations. Dr. Ranshofen-Wertheimer's book, which is one of the Carnegie Endowment Studies in the Administration of International Law and Organization, is in the best tradition of pre-Hitlerian German scholarship, and if at times it seems to be a little closer to Ogg and Ray than to Gierke, this can only be attributed to the remarkable facility with which Dr. Ranshofen-Wertheimer, as a true "interna- tional man," has approximated his adopted scholarly milieu during his residence in the United States. Chester Purves has, on the other hand, said his piece in a concise essay of about thirty thousand words which can be pretty thoroughly digested while, for example, wait- ing to get the long-distance operator in Wash- ington. And if Purves is sometimes more Pass- fieldian than Addisonian, it must be remem- bered that even English literature has its muta- tions, and not everyone can coin a phrase like Winston Churchill. The significant thing about these two studies is that, although they are inevitably autobio- graphical, they have achieved a very real criti- cal detachment toward the operations of the League secretariat. They are at the same time highly informed and completely disinterested, although one strongly suspects that the per- formances of the then Sir Eric Drummond and of Joseph Avenol get less than their deserts; despite the detachment of the authors, they are still pukka international civil servants who cannot bring themselves to say the things that ought to be said about their principals. I ROBABLY the best thing that the League of Nations was able to do was to demonstrate conclusively the feasibility of establishing a truly international civil service-of assembling and organizing a group of highly competent officials and employees owing exclusive loyalty to the international organization itself, having a remarkable esprit de corps, and capable of taking a completely unbiased point of view in the consideration of problems in which the interests even of the countries of which they were themselves nationals might be involved. It is perhaps not too much to say that despite the failures of the secretaries-general of the League to provide adequate administrative and political leadership, despite the horrible mess that was made in staffing and integrating the League High Command, and despite the instability of structure and organization en- gendered by excessive empiricism in the ap- proach to the problem of administration, the quality of the personnel which was attracted to Geneva almost made the League an out- standing administrative success. Observers and commentators from within and without the secretariat have repeatedly borne witness to the fact that men can achieve and maintain the conviction that the highest interests of one's own country are served best by the pro- motion of security and welfare everywhere. "As long as international administration is not world government, demanding an integral transformation of one's national loyalty into a global loyalty, the person most useful for in- ternational service is one combining'the best characteristics of his national origins with be- lief in and devotion to the international agency in which he is employed. This synthesis is possible, as the practice of more than twenty years has proved beyond doubt, and can be achieved even under the system of sovereign states" (Ranshofen-Wertheimer, p. 244). But the League accomplished more than the founding of a merely loyal international civil service; it attracted to Geneva many of the ablest administrators of its era, and many of these remained steadfastly at their posts and firm in their loyalty to the international ideal even when the very foundations of collective security and international cooperation were being pulled to pieces by totalitarian arro- gance and democratic cowardice. The basic considerations and the funda- mental difficulties involved in the building of the League service have been summarized by Chester Purves in the following words: Recruitment is the most difficult, as is it the most important, of the functions falling to the internal administration of an international authority. It sets 72</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS problems in the solution of which experience in the national sphere is only of limited value .... The task of the national recruiting officer is com- paratively simple. He can gauge his outflow and intake with almost absolute precision each year. Except in one or two polyglot countries, all his candidates speak and write the same language as their mother-tongue. They have all imbibed the same traditions at home and school. And even where, as in England and Scotland, there are different educational systems, the divergences are not so wide as to prevent the establishment of a common standard of qualification. He is not hampered by the reflection that the number of posts in the service is so small that if misfits occur a transfer cannot be made to another position where the official may find a chance to develop and display his true capacities. He can offer life appointment in the certainty that certeris paribus they are for life and that there will be every opportu- nity not only for advancement within the grade but also for promotion, possibly the attainment of the highest ranks and the recognition of special merit by the award of honours. He may have to resist the en- croachments of nepotism, and he is not confronted with the claims of national prestige, which, if not more insistent, are at any rate less easy to answer. The international authority at Geneva could rely on none of these advantages. There was no regular outflow and intake of staff, even in those branches of clerical and stenographic work where such conditions might be expected to obtain. Few candidates could speak one of the official languages, French and English, as their mother-tongue, and it was only after years of training that those who upon appointment spoke them com- paratively fluently as foreign tongues became sufficiently proficient in the written language to be entrusted with the drafting of official documents and correspondence. National traditions and educational qualifications were nearly as diverse as the Member States themselves. The narrow limits set by the budgetary allocation of posts were so rigid that transfers of staff, in the higher ranks, at any rate, were almost impossible, while the small number of posts in each grade made the avoidance of possible misfits essential if the efficiency of the service was to be maintained. Life appointments until the age of 60 were at one time the rule, but the League itself being on trial, as it were, throughout the twenty years of its existence in Geneva, the Assembly, for safety's sake, reduced the maximum terms of engagements to seven years, this being the minimum necessary for admission to the Staff Pensions Fund. Promotion was slow and difficult, even in the lower categories; for the higher grades, although not unknown, it was the excep- tion. Acceptance of national honours was, for obvious reasons, prohibited by the Staff Regulations. Finally, if nepotism was not rife, it was by no means unknown, while questions of national prestige could make the recruiting officer's life a bane. What then were the advantages that we at Geneva could offer to attract from the national services and national employment men and women who had every opportunity of making a career at home? For, as a recent survey has judiciously pointed out, the inter- national recruiter must be on his guard in considering an offer of services from people who have strayed into international life merely because they could not find an appropriate niche at home. First, the appeal of the novel idea of international collaboration in the cause of peace. Secondly, salary scales at rates higher than those prevailing in the civil services of many of the Member States, but not all. Thirdly, a pensions scheme fed by contributions from both League and staff and specially devised to attract men and women who would be prepared to devote only part of their careers to the international service, since an official retiring after ten years' service qualified for a pension and could choose between an annuity and a lump sum payment. That there were serious deficiencies in League personnel administration few knowl- edgeable persons would deny, least of all Purves or Ranshofen-Wertheimer, although there might be considerable disagreement as to how these deficiencies ought to be remedied. Prob- ably the major defect was the excessive rigidity, both horizontal and vertical, of the classifica- tion scheme. The horizontal rigidity was, of course, a consequence of the introduction of the English and continental "class" systems into the international civil service-a sort of bluestocking predestinationism by virtue of which all international babies were born with either executive, administrative, or clerical and manual (the terminology is American) souls and, being so born, could never expect to escape, or even be reincarnated, into a more exalted category. The vertical rigidity had no fundamental anthropomorphic bases but was an inevitable result of the bad budgetary prac- tices imposed upon the secretariat by the Gen- eral Assembly. There was a great deal of lip- service paid to the idea of open-end recruit- ment, promotion, and transfer in the Noble- maire Report, in the Report of the Committee of thirteen, and in the Staff Regulations of the League, but the practical results, due to the urgencies of national representation in the upper-bracket positions, were not very impres- sive. Purves suggests (pp. 35 and 71-78) that the answer to this problem, among several others, is the establishment of a unified per- sonnel administration for the UNO Secretariat and for all of the international bodies which may be set up by the UNO. Ranshofen- Werth- eimer points out that the interagency transr fer arrangements existing among the League, the ILO, and the Court never amounted to very much and falls back upon compulsory in-service promotions for all except a small number of top posts. There is much to be said 73</page><page sequence="4">PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW for both these suggestions, and the problem of interorganizational arrangements for col- laboration in the administration of personnel will constitute an important chapter of the agreements contemplated under Article 63 of the San Francisco Charter. But, to my mind, until the system of class recruitment is com- pletely destroyed and the artificial and unreal- istic compartmentalization which it produces is thoroughly eliminated, a career civil service, national or international, will remain a mere polite phrase. The vertical rigidity can, of course, be eliminated only by the institution of budgetary and administrative relationships between the legislative and executive branches fundamentally different from those which existed in the League of Nations. II THE administrative structure and organiza- tion of the League secretariat, or for that matter the organization of the entire League, was a strange and wonderful phenomenon. There were four major factors in the adminis- trative sphere which made the work of the really excellent subordinate personnel of the League secretariat almost impossible: (1) the failure of the secretaries-general to provide effective leadership; (2) the resulting encroach- ment of certain members of the Assembly in the field of administrative management; (3) the chaotic situation in the High Command of the secretariat due to the excessive emphasis upon national representation among the prin- cipal officers; (4) the fluidity and instability of structure, procedures, and interrelationships at the operations level resulting from the lack of a consistent administrative philosophy and the failure to appreciate the relation between form and function. It is true that the final draft of the Covenant of the League of Nations gave the secretary- general no very considerable responsibilities with respect to leadership in the formulation of the policies of the organization. He was re- quired to act as secretary-general at all meet- ings of the Assembly and the Council and might convene meetings of the Council upon the request of any member of the League. As Ranshofen-Wertheimer remarks: The two Secretaries-General kept scrupulously, even over-scrupulously, within the constitutional limits and did not even avail themselves as fully as they could have done of the marginal possibilities for action and influence open to them. There was nothing in the Covenant, for example, which prevented the Secretary- General from speaking in Assembly or Council meetings. Quite on the contrary. Rule g of the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly especially referred to this matter by stating that the Secretary-General "may be invited by the President [of the Assembly] to make verbal com- munications concerning any question under considera- tion." It clearly depended upon the Secretary-General whether he wished to be invited to address the Assembly or not. The situation which actually arose was thus not altogether attributable to the constitution. Neither of the two Secretaries-General availed him- self to any considerable extent of this and similar op- portunities. A few instances are recorded in which the Secretary-General personally intervened in a public Council meeting. At the opening of the public Council session on January 29, 1932, for instance, Sir Eric Drummond read the Chinese communication demand- ing the extension of the League action provided for in Article XI to Article XV. On September 18, 1936, M. J. Avenol made a statement to the Council in which he tried to justify his much criticized visit to Rome, under- taken in an attempt to bring Italy back into an active collaboration with the League, by characterizing it as undertaken "in the normal performance of his duties." In a few cases in which budgetary or personnel ques- tions were discussed the Secretary-General asked to be heard; but these cases were exceptional.... The tradition of the Secretary-General addressing the Assembly or the Council could and should have been established in the early days of the League when everything was still in flux. The novelty of the spectacle might have caused a slight initial fluster on the part of some delegates and diplomats wrapped in outdated traditions. But their susceptibilities were then also being tested by other features of the new instrument for international cooperation and they were becoming ac- customed to seeing many of their cherished traditions upset at Geneva. Had the Secretary-General personally presented his annual report and had he availed himself of this op- portunity to expound and interpret international trends and possibilities of action, the general discussion of the Assembly might have been lifted into a real exchange of views instead of becoming a mere sequence of set speeches and official declarations. Soon the States would have accepted this procedure as a matter of course, as they have in the case of the ILO [pp. 38-40]. The tradition established by the first secre- tary-general, and followed by his successor, of abstaining from intervention in the delibera- tions of the Council and the Assembly, was bad enough from the standpoint of over-all League policy; from the standpoint of internal admin- istration of the secretariat it was tragic. Neither Drummond nor Avenol was willing to present and vigorously to defend the work-programs 74</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS and budgets of the secretariat as "administra- tion" measures. The entire responsibility for familiarizing the Assembly with the organiza- tion, operations, and financial requirements of the secretariat was left to the individual action of members of the appropriating body, since the ponderous Fourth Committee of the As- sembly early in its history demonstrated its complete incapacity for dealing with such com- plicated problems. The plain fact is that the secretaries-general, in completely abdicating political leadership, abdicated at the same time a very substantial part of their adminis- trative leadership, because administrative lead- ership must, at some point, inevitably cross the line into the field of politics-certainly in se- curing legislative consent for work-programs and budgetary policies. The inescapable sequel to this lack of leader- ship in the High Command of the secretariat was a shift in the center of administrative gravity. But the development of the Super- visory Commission was a great deal more than a mere shift of administrative responsibility- it was a radical realignment of the entire bal- ance of power among all the instrumentalities of the League. The 1920 Assembly rejected a proposal for the creation of a small commis- sion to exercise general oversight over finan- cial and administrative affairs, on the grounds that such a committee was superfluous. In 1921, however, the Assembly reversed its posi- tion and recommended to the Council the creation of a control commission to be ap- pointed by the latter. This was done, and until 1928 the Supervisory Commission functioned with reasonable satisfaction as a standing budgetary committee, operating mainly in the review of the budgetary proposals of the secre- tary-general and, in the name of the Council, making recommendations thereon to the As- sembly. In that year Mr. Carl J. Hambro of Norway proposed to the Ninth Assembly that the members of the Supervisory Commission be appointed by the Assembly itself, on the ground that full control of expenditures ought to reside in the body in which all nations that contributed financially were directly repre- sented. From this point forward the march of the Supervisory Commission, under the leader- ship of Osusky and later of Hambro, to a posi- tion of complete dominance of League policy and League administration was steady and un- remitting. Constitutionally, as Ranshofen-Wertheimer points out, the Supervisory Commission had no policy-shaping functions. Its duty was to supervise the carrying into effect of certain policies regarding economy in League opera- tions which had been decided upon by the Assembly. "The Commission," he remarks, "began its activities safeguarding the execu- tion of the policies of the Assembly, it pro- ceeded to interpret them in the light of its knowledge of facts and figures, and, eventual- ly, suggested and even dictated policies." It rapidly expanded its power to include con- sideration not only of how a given piece of work could most economically be executed but of whether it should be done at all, and wheth- er it should be done in preference to some other project. In short, it assumed not only the secretary-general's responsibility for formu- lating and presenting work-programs and budgets, but it likewise captured most of the Assembly's power with respect to the approved of work-programs, since neither the Assembly nor its unwieldy Fourth Committee was capable of dealing in detail with operational problems. The dominant position of the Supervisory Commission became evident to the world at large when the deterioration of international political relations made the normal function- ing of the League machinery virtually impos- sible. In 1938 the Assembly vested the heads of the secretariat and the ILO, acting with the approval of the Supervisory Commission, with the Assembly's powers in the financial and ad- ministrative field. The Assembly in 1939 re- newed this delegation of power and for 1940 invested the Supervisory Commission with the financial and administrative powers of the Council. In 1940 the Supervisory Commission itself resolved that until the Assembly should decide otherwise, the Supervisory Commission would exercise all the powers conferred upon the Council by the regulations for the financial administration of the staff provident fund. With this action the circle had been com- pleted; the servant was now the master. The evolution of the Supervisory Commis- sion was neither good nor bad, but it was not responsible administration. Given the re- 75</page><page sequence="6">PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW ticence of Drummond and the weakness of Avenol, the strength of Osusky and Hambro, and the gathering of the holocaust which was shortly to overwhelm Europe and the world, its evolution was inevitable. And it must be remembered to the credit of the Supervisory Commission that in 1940, when Avenol aban- doned completely the interests of the League and its staff, it was the Supervisory Commis- sion which stood firm and performed as best it could its heartbreaking job as trustee in bankruptcy of the Great Ideal. The complete nationalization and politiciza- tion of the High Command is a matter of com- mon knowledge. Its effects in destroying ad- ministrative integrity and unity of purpose are less fully appreciated. It was, of course, to be expected that the posts of secretary- general, deputy secretary-general, and under- secretaries-general, constituting the upper stra- tum of the High Command, should have been filled with an eye to the equitable distribution of top positions among the Great Powers. But League practice went much further. From the beginning, the majority of the upper stratum were in an anomalous position. They were es- sentially ambassadors with advisory and repre- sentative functions, extraneously injected into an administrative organization. Moreover, they were political appointees actually chosen not by the secretary-general, to whom they were administratively responsible, but by the foreign offices of the countries which they represented, or named because of their na- tionality with the open support of their gov- ernments. From the first moment, therefore, the secretary-general was surrounded by col- leagues whom he had not appointed and whom, in the final analysis, he could not con- trol. Even in the lower stratum of the High Com- mand, the appointment of directors was strongly influenced by the factor of nationality. But the directors were not national nominees, as were the deputies and undersecretaries. Since their appointments were for seven years and indefinitely renewable, their tenure ap- proximated much more closely that of the per- manent international civil service. Their advisory and representative functions were, in the main, accidental and occasional rather than major and continuing responsibilities. On the whole, the handling of the problem of nation- ality in the naming of directors in the League secretariat represents the legitimate and healthy response of an international agency to the demands of its constituency for participa- tion in its administration. Dr. Ranshofen- Wertheimer's brilliant analysis of the political problems of the High Command in the League secretariat drives home a very salient fact which the founders of the United Nations Or- ganization will do well to remember-that while it is necessary and proper to make con- cessions to nationality in the constitution of the High Command, the secretary-general must have the final and exclusive authority to decide which one of the 184 million Russians, the 38 million French, or the 458 million Chinese shall serve in the top positions of the UNO; up to and including the very highest administrative positions subordinate to his own. Both Purves and Ranshofen-Wertheimer re- fer repeatedly to the "empirical" approach to the problem of administrative structure which characterized the development of the secre- tariat's organization. "The League itself and a fortiori the secretariat were experimental or- ganizations, and their methods accordingly empirical. Reorganization was, so to speak, a standing order" (Purves, p. 8). "With a typical- ly British aversion to charts and blueprints the Secretary-General approached the task em- pirically. He wanted to see the new organism grow according to its own inner laws and there- fore avoided placing the administration in a strait-jacket. His modus procedendi was to establish a catalogue of the tasks entrusted to the international organization by the League Covenant and those implied in the different treaties, to single out those demanding early action or attention on the part of the Council or Assembly, and then to establish the neces- sary services for these activities within the framework of a skeleton organization" (Rans- hofen-Wertheimer, p. 82). Now the kindest thing that Webster can find to say about "empirical" is to define it as "depending on experience and observation alone, without due regard to science and theory." There is a good deal of evidence that Purves, Ranshofen-Wertheimer, and Webster are all correct. The League secretariat was clearly not 76</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS founded on precedents, although there was, in the British public service, a substantial body of experience that was relevant. Nor was it built upon any very coherent organizational theory, although the beginnings of the science of administration had long since been estab- lished. It is not strange, therefore, that the pat- tern of League administrative structure re- flected most of all the idiosyncrasies of the men who from time to time directed the various subordinate divisions and services, that there was an incomprehensible admixture of staff and line operations, that the management and auxiliary services were completely scrambled, or that divisional structure was at one time dominated by notions of functional organiza- tion, at another by process, at another by clientele, at another by geographical considera- tions, and sometimes by all four at once. All this, of course, is not unmitigated evil. A rea- sonable amount of fluidity in organization is essential. But the absence of any attempt at defining the basic organizational principles of the League secretariat overemphasized its susceptibility to needless experimentation and purely capricious change. Moreover, the pre- occupation of the secretary-general with the reshuffling and reconstitution of the basic ad- ministrative cells prevented the development of adequate topside management. Even the proposals of the 1930 Committee of Thirteen left fifteen independent officials reporting di- rectly to the secretary-general, and the secre- tariat never developed machinery for the con- tinuous integration of operations. The impor- tant role which has been given to the division of administrative management of the United States Bureau of the Budget in the work of the UNO Preparatory Commission is a significant and happy augury that this time the empirical approach may be reinforced with an adequate appreciation of the principles of management and administration. III THE secretariat of the League led a very thorny financial existence. While salaries were, on the whole, liberal and pension provi- sions entirely adequate, the administration of League financial affairs on the policy side left a good deal to be desired. Both Purves and Ranshofen-Wertheimer lay considerable stress on the severity of budgetary review in the League. "The budget estimates were subjected to an inspection of a severity and minuteness unparalleled in national conditions" (Purves, p. 8). "From the very beginning, the budget of the League was subjected to criticism and close control from outside, as well as very strict internal control" (Ranshofen-Wertheimer, p. 223). But mere severity of budgetary review or strictness of financial control never hurt any agency. What made the situation difficult in the League was the basis upon which the re- view was made and the control exercised. It is a fundamental postulate which every budget- maker understands, and which is a principal factor in the armament of topside budgeting, that carefully formulated work-programs and budgets that go to the legislative branch as unified "administration" measures are consid- ered pretty largely within the terms of refer- ence which the budget-maker provides. Legis- latures amend or reject programs, but, very extraordinary circumstances aside, they do not substitute programs. From a practical point of view, even where the budget-maker presents his work-program in such form as to maximize the possibilities of legislative control, about all the legislative branch can do is to say "Yes," or "Not so much," or, usually, "Morel" The League budget did not go to the As- sembly as a unified "administration" measure, because the secretaries-general never accepted the political responsibility implicit in the pres- entation and defense of an administration work-program. In budget matters, the position of the head of the inter- national administration was truly unenviable. . . . He was responsible for the budget under the League con- stitution; as a matter of fact he was, in this respect, the government, the finance minister, and the authority responsible for the proper disbursement of the funds provided by the budget-all in one person. Moreover, the position was further complicated by the fact that he lacked that support for his budget which a govern- ment enjoying the confidence of the legislature must possess in order to carry out its program. He was, as a writer on League affairs puts it, in the position of a man who attempts to get his budget "voted by a Parlia ment where everyone belonged to the Opposition' [Ranshofen-Wertheimer, pp. 223-24]. No more damning indictment of the inade- quacy of administrative leadership on the part of the League secretaries-general could be formulated. 77</page><page sequence="8">PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW So it was that the Supervisory Commission and the Assembly, being unable to deal with the financial program of the secretariat on the basis of over-all work-program and large prin- ciples of policy, operated in terms of estimate details, wrangled over individual salaries and inconsequential items of proposed expendi- ture, and, in general, made a thorough mess of the legislative responsibility for control of basic policy. It is worth noting that although the budget of the ILO was an integral part of the League of Nations budget, neither the Supervisory Commission, the League Budget Committee, nor the Assembly ever subjected the ILO budget to the restrictions which were imposed upon the secretariat itself (Ranshofen- Wertheimer, p. 390). The excessive rigidity of League budgetary and financial arrangements resulted, as Purves has noted, in a complete inability on the part of the secretariat to meet emergencies as and when they arose and in a virtually complete freezing of personnel which made transfers and adjustments almost impossible. In addi- tion, it produced the inevitable corollary of overrigid budgeting and line-item appropria- tion-overbudgeting. The League budget was usually from o1 to 20 per cent higher than actual expenditure. Even overbudgeting, how- ever, did little to relieve the financial strait- jacket in which the secretariat operated, since balances were rarely made available for trans- fer and the appropriation system strongly dis- couraged the inauguration of new activities from unexpended balances. Ranshofen-Wertheimer makes a very con- siderable point of the need for the creation of large reserves in an international organization such as the League of Nations, and this view was likewise emphasized by the group of League ex-officials convened by the Royal In- stitute in 1944. The objective is apparently to stabilize the level of resources of the interna- tional organization during periods of economic dislocation, on the one hand, and to mitigate budgetary rigidities, on the other. There is a good argument for the establishment of re- serves in any social enterprise, or in any pri- vate business for that matter. But to establish reserves for the purpose of remedying the de- fects of mere fiscal mechanics, which was the main trouble with League procedures, seems to be getting the cart before the horse. IV THE Royal Institute of International Affairs and the Carnegie Endowment's Division of International Law have struck pay-dirt in their projects for the exploration of the administra- tive history of the League of Nations and the ILO. And it is no criticism of either Purves or Ranshofen-Wertheimer to say that they raise infinitely more problems than they re- solve and suggest a multitude of researches out- side the terms of reference of these two studies. There are still many good books left in the experience of the League and the ILO. These are important documents on a su- premely important theme. As Ranshofen- Wertheimer, a German whose English remains the admiration and despair of this reviewer, phrases it: New instruments of international cooperation emerg- ing out of the great deluge [of war] are the legitimate successors of proud concepts and institutions of bygone days whose hour of glory has passed. Sovereignty in the nineteenth-century meaning of the term is one of them, diplomacy is another. They will survive the present Armageddon. But both will be weakened, the one as the chief safeguard for the survival of States, big, medium, and small; the other as the main instrument for preserving peace. International organization, an in- truder and a stranger among us yesterday, is today claiming its rightful place as the coordinator beyond national boundaries and the purveyor for the changed needs of mankind .... In the minds of the best of a whole generation, the setting up of a more orderly, more cooperative world has assumed the significance of a symbol. World or- ganization, to them, is the means of expiation for the errors of the past for which they have suffered and bled. Here, to them, is the task of all tasks. Here the clarion call of the future [pp. 440-41]. 78</page></plain_text>
