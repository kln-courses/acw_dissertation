<plain_text><page sequence="1">MODE NISM AND ITS IEPRESSED: ICUI!E-f ILLET AS ANTI-CCLCNIAIIST Jacques Leenhardt LECTURE POLITIQUE DU ROMAN: LA JALOUSIE D'ALAIN ROBBE-GRILLET Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1973 During the current lull in American literary studies, when the rhetoric of the New Criticism is as discredited as the ideology of liberalism itself, when archetypal criticism has turned out to be a merely typological or classificatory operation, and the comfortable old pursuits of image-counting and thematics have settled back down in possession of the field, two more recent European models have seemed to have something new to offer. They are, on the one hand, Franco-Italian structural- ism, with its methodological codification in semiotics, and on the other, the stream- lined Hegelianism of the Frankfurt School, not the least attractive feature of which- for American intellectuals-lies in its capacity to provide a Marxist theory without a Marxist practice. The trouble is-as ever more numerous translations of these two tendencies have begun to make clear-that the two approaches appear to be mutually exclu- sive, both in their basic philosophical presuppositions and in their day-to-day critical operations. It is not very difficult to provide a check-list of these incompatibilities: synchronic versus diachronic thought, scientism versus the critique of positivism, the primacy of language versus the primacy of society, the building of small-scale models versus the intuitive, totalizing, trans-cultural or trans-historical generalization, etc. What is harder is to find some field or object over which these two "methods" can meet in such a way that their respective explanatory powers can be concretely compared. Jacques Leenhardt's book on Robbe-Grillet may serve to give us a glimpse of the form such a confrontation might take. A Marxist study of Robbe-Grillet, its dedication reminds us that it was conceived as a prolongation of the work of the late Lucien Goldmann on the nouveau roman; yet its language and diagrams are those, linguistics-oriented, of a more recent semiotic research and thus invite the kind of comparison we have proposed when they do not always articulate it. Yet the very framework of the book, already a strategic choice, dramatizes the struc- tural dilemmas involved in the attempt to use both methods at the same time: for its conception as an immense, in-depth exegesis of a single text at once excludes the comparative study of a whole corpus of works that gave Goldmann's literary analyses their scope and authority, while at the same time making it impossible to measure the expressive capacity of Jealousy against that of the art works of other historical periods or social configurations, as Adorno himself was inveterately inclined to do, with results so often luminous. Thus-and this from the very outset, owing to the plan of the work Itself-we must not expect to find in Leenhardt's study a treat- ment of the specificity of the nouveau roman as a whole, nor an evaluation of its significance as one moment in the development of modernism. Yet these are not, as we shall see later on, simply additional topics which it is a critic's privilege to ignore or to postpone for some more general consideration, but rather fundamental limitations which return to take their toll of the study's inherent strengths. The lat- ter, however, and in particular the rock-drill constituted by so systematic a depth- sociological reading of this particular novel, have enough explosive potential to make some fairly consequent inroads of their own on the formalistic landscape. Leenhardt's book suggests yet a further inconsistency between semiotics and critical theory which is perhaps more fundamental than any of those enumerated above and which I would characterize as the attitude towards, and the role played by, the negative in both systems. The importance of negation and of the valorization of contradiction or absence in dialectical thinking is well known; while the reduc- tion of negation to what it used to be in pre-dialectical philosophy, namely a mere logical category or the marking of quasi-mathematical valences, is probably also familiar to anyone who has worked with Levi-Strauss or Greimas. What is perhaps only now becoming clear, in the writings of so-called post-structuralist thinkers like Deleuze or J.-F. Lyotard, is the ideological significance of the refusal of the negative and the profound vocation of the new philosophy to seek a model made up of FREDRIC JAMESON Fredric Jameson teaches French litera- ture at La Jolla. His Marxism and Form was reviewed in Diacritics II, No. 3 (1972), and his Prison-House of Lan- guage in Diacritics III, No. 2 (1973). The language which provides most of the material for the analysis is a purged language, purged ... .1 of the means for expressing any other con- tents than those furnished to the in- dividuals by their society. The linguis- tic analyst finds this purged language an accomplished fact, and he takes the impoverished language as he finds it, insulating it from that which is not expressed in it [... .] Linguistic philos- ophy [thereby] suppresses once more what is continually suppressed in this universe of discourse and behavior. Herbert Marcuse, One-Dimensional Man ciocritics /Summer 1976 7</page><page sequence="2">nothing but positivities: this repudiation of the dialectic, with its valorization of ab- sence and contradiction, now draws renewed authority for its exaltation of the present from a revival of Nietzschean vitalism. Meanwhile, an analogous "positivism" (did not Levi-Strauss, on a memorable occasion, describe himself as a "mechanical ma- terialist"?) informs the scientific claims of semiotics itself to banish all traces of the subject, along with the negative from its account of the object itself..The implica- tions of which may quickly be suggested in terms of literary analysis: semiotics is the implicit development of a program explicitly announced in the work of the post-structuralists, namely, the attempt to continue to talk of a given phenomenon without interpretation, whether it be that of the psychoanalytic diagnosis of a symptom, or of the dialectical reading of a culture in history. Science or schizophrenia, intensites, structures or the Freudian death wish-strange bedfellows all temporarily allied against Marx or Freud themselves! The inextricable relationship of interpretation to the negative may now be concretely measured by what Leenhardt has and has not been able to do with his reading of Jealousy. Its superiority to other readings, its incommensurability with them, what is properly scandalous for the orthodoxy of nouveau roman scholarship, lies in his demonstration that Robbe-Grillet's novel has content, that it is "about" something and possesses a genuine "referent": in the occurrence Africa, the colonial situation, imperialism and neo-imperialism, racism, wars of national liberation- realities it seems incongruous enough to mention in the same breath as the nou- veau roman, much as though we were to be told that James Joyce was the greatest novelist of the IRA! Yet the complexity of Leenhardt's critical procedure here may be suggested by a distinction between "referent" and "meaning": insofar, in other words, as the esthetic of Jealousy proposes something like a pure play of signifiers, a combination and variation of relatively free-floating sentences, this insistence on the book's "signified," this search for something like its meaning or message might fairly enough be taken as a way of refusing to perceive the work altogether. It is just such wrong-headed or misguided quests for "meaning" which have been stig- matized as interpretation by the most articulate spokesmen for modern art. But when we recall that Jakobson's terminology substitutes the word context for that of referent, we glimpse the possibility of an interpretive operation of a wholly differ- ent type, whose specificity even the term "semantics"-insofar as it might also apply to the study of the "signified"-tends to blur, and which might better be char- acterized as a transcendence of the inner, formal experience of the work or of the signifier by a study of its material and referential preconditions. This is, it seems to me, what Leenhardt is up to in a work which juxtaposes travel brochures and sociological treatises on the colonial experience with explorations of the novel's imagery and close attention to the patterns of the banana trees: such heterogeneity is indeed deliberate, and the shock in store for the student of belles lettres is not only healthy, it is exemplary, and emblematic of that reversal of work and reader alike which any genuinely materialistic criticism ought to effectuate and to which we will return shortly. Suffice it to say that Leenhardt's approach goes a good deal further than Robbe-Grillet's own program, according to which the reality which the nou- veau roman was "about," and the sense in which it could be considered "realistic" [Robbe-Grillet, For. a New Novel (New York: Grove Press, 1965), "From Realism to Reality," pp. 157-68] was simply a shift in the phenomenological experience of the world in our own day, and the subsequent disintegration of categories like those of the subject, of time, of things, and the like: Robbe-Grillet, indeed, makes a case for some profoundly critical value of his own novels in the sense of the Frankfurt School, in their narrative demystification of the very categories of the ideology of everyday life. This suggests a rather peculiar reading of Jealousy as standing some- where between Gide's Voyage au Congo and Voltaire's Contes philosophiques: but if it cannot be stressed enough that a project like' that outlined by Robbe-Grillet is an essentially idealistic one, in that it takes as its object our thoughts about and experiences of reality rather than the latter's material origins and causes, its real ambiguity lies, as Leenhardt shows and as we shall see shortly, in that concept of a "newer" reality in the name of which the critique of the older one is undertaken. At any rate, this kind of description of the overall aims of Robbe-Grillet's narrative technique in general must give way to more specific local traditions in the reading of Jealousy itself; and here, it seems to me, Leenhardt's thesis-neces- sarily metacritical as well as critical-confronts two main formalistic strategies, or, if you prefer, two versions of the canonical formalist position on the novel, some- thing like a weak and a strong version, or a literal and a figurative, a restricted and a generalized approach. The purer of these positions-Ricardou may be taken as its most vigorous representative-refuses interpretation in the name of the text itself, seen as a process by which the combination of metaphoric and descriptive functions ultimately neutralise expression itself. This process has an inner logic of its own:</page><page sequence="3">In so perfectly closed a set as this book is, a systematic combination of all its ele- ments would ultimately require, along with the disruption of time, the actualization of all their possibilities, which is to say, in particular, of all their contraries. Along with this saturation of relationship, textual space also gives rise to a concept of neutralization: this is indeed the phenomenon in which the cause of the novel's ultimate return to stillness may be found. [lean Ricardou, Problemes du nouveau roman (Paris: Seuil, 1967), p. 143] I suspect, as I have suggested elsewhere, [The Prison-House of Language (Princeton, N. J.: Princeton Univ. Press, 1972), pp. 182-83] that even this extreme and rigorously absolute formalism is not really as formalistic as it means to be, and that in reality- far from constituting a repudiation of interpretation-it is itself an allegorical inter- pretation whose "signified" or allegorical key is simply that of language or ecriture or the text itself. Even if such a suspicion prove baseless, however, it is undeniably the case that the position of Ricardou is too demanding to be maintained for long, and that it tends imperceptibly to slip into another one which this time is quite openly a hermeneutic with its own specific interpretive content, namely that of psycho- analysis itself. (Derrida may be taken as a textbook illustration of this process, a book like the Grammatologie drawing its most fundamental content and persuasive force from that very Freudianism which it was concerned to assimilate to the more formal model of differance and trace.) As far as Robbe-Grillet is concerned, this slip- page is no doubt facilitated by some deep structural ambiguity within the novels, in which, alongside the endless textual variations of the surface, there rises some more global atmosphere of psychopathology, whether it be child molesting (Le Voyeur), a drop in mental functioning characteristic of brain injuries (Dans le labyrinthe), or the sado-masochism of the later works, whose more conventional alliance with pornography signals a weakening of some of the more interesting tensions and transgressions of the earlier ones. In the case of lealousy, Leenhardt observes that none of the previous critics have been able to free themselves from the spell of the title and from the immediate first impression that the book must be about a menage a trois: One is indeed astonished to observe that all the critics, from the most traditionally psychologizing, like Bruce Morrissette, to those, like lean Ricardou, most rigorously attentive to narrative mechanisms, have discussed this novel in terms of erotic jealousy, of a cuckolded husband, etc. Such wondrous unanimity conveys the power of the myth, none of the critics having been able to transcend it by way of some second-degree recuperation. [p. 209] His first task will therefore be an assault on this unspoken primacy of psycho- logical and psychoanalytic interpretation, the relative autonomy of which reflects the profound fragmentation of modern social life into private and public sectors of the psyche, at the same time that-as in the present case-it offers a last-ditch strategy for evading any genuinely historical or social approach to literary material. For the most private and solitary fact remains a social one, and the invention of mediations between the psychoanalytic and the political simply demands the en- largement of the frame of reference in such a way that the social character of the psychic phenomenon in question becomes visible. This is, I suppose, why Leenhardt begins his restructuration of the classic psychoanalytic reading of Jealousy with what is perhaps its most generalizable version, namely the diagnosis of this novel (and others by the same writer) as an obsessional construction. Such a reading, [that of Didier Anzieu in, "Le Discours de l'obsessionnel dans les romans de Robbe-Grillet," Temps modernes, 233 (Oct., 1965), 608-37] in contrast to some of the other Freudian codes available (Oedipus complex, phallic symbols, allegory of the psyche, etc.), is already in itself mediatory by virtue of the phenomenological description inherent in it of the movement of the text: that rhythm according to which the sentences begin to live a compulsive life of their own ("in Jealousy, indeed, what is sick or jealous is simply language itself, as a whole" [p. 131]), suddenly and obsessively be- ginning to count all the banana trees in the plantation, to describe the geometrical arrangement of the fields, to enumerate even the most minor deviations from the overall plan of the cultivated area (see, for example, Robbe-Grillet, Two Novels [New York: Grove, 1965], pp. 50-4. The depersonalized autonomy of these sentences thus comes to figure something like those mechanical rituals by which hysterical patients distract themselves from the pressure of anxiety forcing at the conscious mind; yet in itself the account of Anzieu is not inconsistent either with that of Ricar- dou above-it simply lends it nascent content. And in a more general way, this char- acterization of the ecriture of Jealousy corrects the abstractness of the two standard diacrtks/Summer 1976 9</page><page sequence="4">views of the nouveau roman, as the novel of things (objective version), or of the ecole du regard (subjective version), not only by insisting that both these poles are part of a process, but also and above all by suggesting that this process itself needs explanation as a determinate phenomenon in its own right. To describe the process as obsession is indeed to bracket both subject and object and to evoke an operation through which external surroundings are some- how neutralized by a look which is itself wholly depersonalized from the outset: it is therefore not a question of reintroducing a psychopathology of the subject at this point, but rather of making a phenomenological analysis of the Look as a social phenomenon whose meaning is independent of individual psychology. Here Leen- hardt uses Sartre against Robbe-Grillet's own critique of La Nausee, of which the later novelist perspicaciously observes that "the first three perceptions recorded at the beginning of the book are all gained by the sense of touch, not that of sight... The sense of touch constitutes, in everyday life, a much more intimate sensation than that of sight," etc. [For a New Novel, p. 651. In what is a locus classicus of modern polemics, indeed, by underscoring the crucial role of smell and of tactility and color perception in Sartre's novel, Robbe-Grillet went on to denounce the tragic human- ism-the unconscious anthropomorphism, if you like-implicit in Sartre's presenta- tion of a world and of its objects, in which human beings remain, in spite of them- selves, inextricably entangled: Drowned in the depth of things, man ultimately no longer even perceives them: his role is soon limited to experiencing, in their name, totally humanized impressions and desires [.. .] The sense of sight immediately appears, in this perspective, as the privileged sense 1...] Optical description is, in effect, the kind which most readily establishes distances: the sense of sight, if it seeks to remain simply that, leaves things in their respective place. [For a New Novel, pp. 68, 73] This demystification of the several senses is of course a fundamental component of Robbe-Grillet's esthetic program and a key strategic operation in that narrative critique of the ideology of everyday life and perception of which we spoke above. But what if one could evaluate all this in a wholly different way? What if the pure look, indeed, were rather the vehicle for something like a will to power over the external world? What if the very refusal of anthropomorphism and of its tragic spirit (of which we may well agree that it continues to lead an underground life in the classical moment of French existentialism) were itself not altogether innocent and expressed a longing to free one's self from the world and from things which had a protopolitical content of its own? We thus return to Sartre's own analyses of the Look, and in particular that outlined in the great preface to Orphee noir, in which the Look, and the position of the subject which it affords ("the right to look without being looked at") is denounced as the very element of white supremacy and of the colonial situation. The symbolic significance, or in other words, the social content, of the act of looking is simply the reaffirmation of my own white skin: an interpre- tation corroborated by the commanding situation of the manor in the novel, dom- inating the slope from which, across a protective distance, the objects of the sur- rounding world can be effectively mastered and visually enumerated to the last detail. We need a better term than that of mere phenomenological analysis to desig- nate the way in which the historical origins and the repressed situational content of an activity like this one-the special kind of inspection inherent in the obsessive visual survey-are restored to the phenomenon itself, thereby constituting its inter- pretation and revealing the social significance of what had hitherto seemed a psy- chological comportment or a mode of perception. This is in fact a sociological ver- sion of the Nietzschean genealogy, in which the trace of older concrete situations is revealed through the demystification of a kind of x-ray process within modern "civilized" phenomena that no longer seem to have anything in common with them: so Nietzsche showed how an older aristocratic insolence lives on within the etymology of the impoverished vocabulary of modern value judgements, while the classes of the heroic age itself-conquerors and conquered-continue to live out their disguised struggle, transfigured beyond all recognition by ressentiment, in the shabby white collars of the industrial city. This process is now to be understood however in a concrete and sociological sense, rather than in that of the Nietzschean myth of history: we would expect a genealogy of the gaze in Jealousy to reveal its distant origins in the rationalization and quantification of that first commercial world of the primitive accumulation of capital, and to bear scars of that transformation of the whole world into one immense bookkeeping system which resulted from the spread of money and the expansion of the market economy. By the mid-twentieth century, however, this type of visual inspection has already entered a late and path- 10</page><page sequence="5">ological stage, and Leenhardt rightly points out that what psychoanalysis calls ob- session in this respect has its exact social and historical equivalent in what he de- scribes as the "morbid geometralization" of the whole colonial system, that de- personalized fascination with numbers and geometrical arrangements rather than with human beings so characteristic of the pacification strategies of the various colonial and counter-insurgency operations [pp. 54-55]. So the apparently purely formal disembodied compulsion of the gaze across the fields has genuine political and economic content which goes far beyond even that of the ideological signif- icance attributed by Robbe-Grillet to his own mode of composition, and this de- spite the fact that we are never given to witness any overtly oppressive act com- mitted by the "narrator" against the native population, and, indeed, in the virtual absence of the field-workers themselves. Such a phenomenological or genealogical reading of the act of looking now provides a transition to the more purely thematic content of the novel, and in particular to the omnipresent effect of light and darkness, with their privileged alternation cast by the slats of the jalousie itself. Yet the preceding discussion has put us in a position to understand these "images" (and it would be well for us to admit that the concept of the image as it is used in current literary criticism, is a deeply problematical one) in something other than the standard "symbolic" sense. Leenhardt's splendid analysis of these materials strikes me as offering a model which may be generalizable to other kinds of literature as well: for him, the thematic imagery of Jealousy may be said to be a compensation and a substitution for pre- cisely those more basic realities of the colonial situation and the native population which, as we have indicated above, have been systematically repressed and ex- cluded in the strict Freudian sense of neurotic denial or Verneinung (the Lacanian denegation). In such a replacement sign-system, light will clearly continue to be the element of the colon himself and the medium of his domination, while its priv- ative, darkness, is as indeterminate and inchoate as the surrounding population itself and expresses fear of that menacing absence through the very vulnerability of the masters and of their mansion in a henceforth invisible world. Leenhardt's analysis also suggests, at this point, the relevance and indeed the fruitfulness of semiotic instruments and methodology: he points out, indeed, that what organizes these elements into a complete sign system cannot really be something so banal as an opposition between light and darkness. Rather, the latter is reorganized into a new artificial, and therefore foregrounded, sign-system in which the opposite of light is not so much darkness as rather nature itself: "Light and nature are thus complementary yet mutually exclusive. We may observe a con- stant alternation of the two from one end of the novel to the other, in a kind of Manichaean struggle" [p. 70]. The content of this new sign or thematic unity may then be resolved into a number of constituent elements, of which the natives them- selves and their songs, but also organic life in general, which is itself significantly "repressed," the larger animals associated with Africa and the various emblematic wild flora and fauna all here represented by something like their most disembodied manifestation, namely insects (the mille-pattes!), and finally refined out of existence in the form of sounds, so that the final opposition of light and sound knows a rich genealogical content of its own. Here, if anywhere, it would seem to me that the analytic machinery worked out by A. J. Greimas finds its proper place and would have much to offer a sociological enterprise of this kind in the way of new insights and corroborative data. Yet the basic objection to this section seems to me to lie elsewhere, in what might be called the insufficient radicalization of Leenhardt's approach to these the- matic materials. For it seems to me possible that the hasty reader may well ignore the fairly complicated model which supports this work, and rather conclude-quite against its whole spirit-that the images of light, sound, nature and the like are for Leenhardt precisely nothing but those "symbols" of some degraded and transparent allegorical meaning. We thus return, in a misreading of this kind, to a confusion between the "interpretation" of a work's signified and that deduction or decon- struction of its referential preconditions of which we spoke above. Before suggesting how this kind of misunderstanding might be avoided, however, let us follow Leen- hardt's account of Jealousy on to the point at which it seems to open itself most fully to such obiections. This is, of course, the "political reading" which gives the work its title and which bears essentially on the central triangle itself: the moment, in other words, in which the critic must fulfill his promise to transform the apparently psychological material of the novel's plot (the trip to the city of the wife and her lover Franck, the "husband-narrator" 's unnamed fantasies of vengeance and depersonalized waves of jealousy) into phenomena of a sociological order. It is here, perhaps, that the legacy of Lucien Goldmann can most strongly be felt; here also that Leenhardt's reading is most liable to one of the classical objections made to the Marxist crit- diacritics /Summer 1976 11</page><page sequence="6">icism in general, namely, that it is essentially allegorical (the "typical" figures stand- ing for the various social classes). For Leenhardt, the two male rivals undoubtedly "represent" two distinct moments of the colonial mentality, in its historical evolu- tion from the stage of classical Western imperialism to that evolved during the de- colonization process after World War II, or in other words, what is henceforth termed neo-colonialism. He marshalls a good deal of detail to support this reading: the disagreements between the narrator and Franck on the skills of the native population, Franck's table manners (repugnant to the narrator, as is in general the former's physicality and his erotic/aggressive vitality), Franck's own mechanical ability (repairing the truck), finally, the various opinions of and positions taken on the so-called African novel, the discussion of which thus serves to place the char- acters ideologically. In this connection, the key passage is the long plot resume of the "novel within the novel" towards the end of the book, in which the "facts" rewrite themselves in a bewildering and comical series of reversals and contradic- tions whose inner logic the above hypothesis now clarifies: The main character of the book is a customs official. This character is not an official but a high-ranking employee of an old commercial company. This company's busi- ness is going badly, rapidly turning shady. This company's business is going ex- tremely well. The chief character-one learns-is dishonest. He is honest, he is trying to re-establish a situation comprised by his predecessor, who died in an automobile accident. But he had no predecessor, for the company was only recently formed; and it was not an accident, etc. [Two Novels, p. 1371 The alternatives, in their most extreme form, are clearly the new entrepreneurial- type private corporation and the older government-protected family firm, often assimilated into the colonial administration itself; while from the point of view of emotional investment and dramatic prognosis, the passage hesitates significantly between the death of Franck (the truck in flames, a fantasy already elaborated earlier in the novel) and the historical supercession of the narrator's own way of life. It is in this sense that the narrative of Jealousy ultimately, for Leenhardt, dramatizes the values of the new technological elite which will come to power in the Fifth Republic, marking an attempt to evolve "an ideology corresponding to the techno- cratic group or class subdivision on the level of production, whose fundamental mission is to overcome both those class antagonisms symbolized by socialist thought as well as the individualism associated with the traditional novel and with right- wing political thought" [p. 36]. So at length-and in spite of Leenhardt's evident attempt to sidestep the terms of the canonical realism/modernism debate-the classical dilemma of Marxist esthetics, that of evaluation, comes once more slowly into view. The situation, as he states it, is not terribly different from that of the romantic culture into which Marxism itself emerged: a literature "progressive" in its aristocratic critique of capi- talism and the nascent business civilization, "reactionary" in its defense of the privileges of a limited group or class. What makes this solution less suitable for the nouveau roman is precisely the qualitative transformation of modernism itself, or in other words, the need to come to terms not only with the ideology of content, but with that of form, of the message inherent in the medium, of the connotative value of experiments with esthetic perception itself. The older Marxism, that of the Thirties, felt itself strong enough to reject the modernistic culture out of hand; yet its strength depended upon the presence of some genuine mass and working class movement to which it could look for real cultural alternatives, and also upon a cultural field less saturated then than it is today by that palpable practice of modernism which is at one with consumer society itself. For in that second "Great Transformation" which followed World War II (and which, for the U. S., we can perhaps conveniently date from the introduction of television and the simultaneous beginning of the Cold War in 1947), the esthetic of modernism has triumphantly penetrated every corner of our psychic space and come to seem as unavoidable as cellophane, pollution, or paperback books. What is perhaps less widely under- stood is the degree to which the very economics of the consumer society, with its emphasis on planned obsolescence and ever more rapid styling and model changes, is intimately dependent on modernism and the new or modernistic sensibility as a laboratory and source for new shapes and patterns. The ultimate evaluation of "modernism" is thus at one with the diagnosis of the new "societe de consommation" itself, and we must surely reject-albeit with regret-the confidence of the Frankfurt School in the continuing negativity and subversive effect of the great modern works of art, voiced as recently as the follow- ing statement of Habermas: "Modern art is as little suited to fulfill the political system's need for legitimation as universalistic value systems . . . The critical poten- 12</page><page sequence="7">tials of art and the powers which it frees for subversive countercultures are un- mistakable" [Jurgen Habermas, "The Place of Philosophy in Marxism," The Insurgent Sociologist, V, 2 (Winter, 1975), 44-45]. It is possible that this illusion may still be possible in Europe, but from the American vantage point surely it is rather Professor Trilling's distress which reflects the more realistic assessment, when, in Beyond Culture, he deplores the waning power of those great and explosively anti-social monuments of the first generation of modernism, when assimilated to the cur- riculum and transformed into cultural institutions in their own right. To insist upon the effortlessness with which the consumer society is able to ab- sorb and coopt even the negativity of formalistic works like those of Beckett and Robbe-Grillet is not necessarily to suggest that a different type of esthetic would have some easier situation to face. On the contrary, I would myself tend to go even further and to claim that all forms of art, when taken as objects in themselves, are co6ptable today, and this holds for art of a revolutionary intent-posters, songs, novels-just as much as for the modernistic ones. Witness, if proof be needed, the burgeoning Brecht-lndustrie, which, busily psychologizing those models of political propaganda, transforming them into the objects of scholarly scrutiny and thereby turning the whole corpus itself into some kind of grisly cultural "institution" in its own right, has triumphantly recuperated everything dangerous in Brecht's plays. (One thinks of the moment in Godard's La Chinoise-its director another prime target for just such cooptation-in which the "revolutionary" heroes, effacing one after another the host of theatrical names on their blackboard from Sophocles to Strindberg, at length sadly run an eraser through the lone surviving one of Brecht himself.) Yet this is so, not because there is no difference between a formalistic and a revolutionary literature, but rather because the very concept of the work of art qua esthetic object is itself a fetishization and an abstraction. What is real is pre- cisely not the isolated script or text itself but rather the work-in-situation, the work- in-performance, in which for a brief moment the gap between producer and con- sumer, between destinataire and destinateur, is momentarily bridged, and the twin crisis of a missing public and an artist without social function is temporarily over- come. We need something like a speech act theory on the level of esthetics itself to shatter the academic reification of the "work of art" and to convince us that the concrete work of art-in other words, Brecht in performance, and by a revolutionary theater group to a politically conscious public-can never be coopted or shorn of its subversive elements. This is, of course, why performance arts like the theater are more easily adapt- able to a revolutionary esthetic than is a form like the novel, itself already a reified product of the twin crisis to which we have just alluded. Yet it is precisely this in- herent reification of the novel as a thing and a portable object which gives radical criticism its reason for being; and if there is a profound ambiguity about a Robbe- Grillet novel all by itself, that ambiguity may surely be reduced, either in that approximation to a concrete situation of performance which is the academic sem- inar, or in conjunction with a critical work like that of Leenhardt, which addresses itself to reducing just those ambiguities and to offering precise instructions for the "bon usage" of the modernistic object in question. What then ought those instructions to be, and can we invent a new way of reading in which the requirements of political and historical consciousness and the specific demands of this particular esthetic form are reconciled, albeit in some new and complex, second-degree mental operation? For it is clear that there can be no question of simply turning Jealousy back into one more novelistic presenta- tion-whether naturalistic or revolutionary-of the colonial situation. We have shown, indeed, that while in the sense of the "referent" the novel is surely "about" colonialism, it must immediately be added that it is also trying not to be, and that its formal structure must be described precisely as an effort to repress that refer- ential content and to defuse the implications of its raw material. Perhaps it would be more adequate to think of this operation in terms of the intentional act of Sartrean mauvaise foi rather than the unconscious of classical psychoanalysis: for every reader knows, when he reads sentences about banana trees and native servants, insects and tropical.drinks on cool verandas, that the narrative "intends" Africa as Its ultimate object or referent; the real problem remains that of the use to which that "knowledge" is put. Here perhaps Cubist painting may furnish a convenient analogy, inasmuch as Cubism also entertains complicated relations with representation and representa- tionality: the viewer is in the same fashion well aware that his gaze "intends" bottles of wine, banjoes, flower vases, tables and bread knives; and yet the paintings de- mand that in some fashion we bracket or suspend that knowledge and attempt to "see" all those objects in some new and utterly unreferential way. They are in other words no longer meant to be stared at as elements of an object-world in their diccritics/Summer 1976 13</page><page sequence="8">own right, as in Chardin or the great Dutch still-lives; rather, they stand as the last inexpungeable vestiges of reality that must persist as a pretext for the viewer's pure absorption in the painterly surface. Yet-and it is this critical reversal that Leen- hardt's book seeks to accomplish for lealousy-yet the fact remains that Cubist paintings also have content, and that content is, if you will, simply the painter's garret, the bateau lavoir, "ma jolie," Paris 1900, and the situation of the artist him- self in it, his patrons among intellectuals and aristocracy, the collectors and the dealers, the Americans, the Third Republic, and ultimately the entire cultural and historical moment itself as it leaves its concentrated trace in the round stain of a wine glass on a deal table. What we are now in a position to see is that modernistic works are not, as the older Marxism would have it, simply ways of distracting us from reality, and of substituting trivial concerns and encouraging "decadent" values and activities (values we can today recognize as simply those-universally programmed in all of us-of the consumer society itself). Such works are (also?) ways of distorting and repressing reality: they do not speak about something essentially different from the content and raw material of revolutionary art; rather, the same fears and concerns, the same historical perceptions and political anxieties pass through them also, only what they attempt to do is not to express, but rather to manage those fears, to disguise them, and drive them underground. Thus, in Jealousy itself, the conflict between colonist and colonized is repressed, and its determinant underground reality masked by a more local conflict among the colonists themselves: in classical Marxist theory, we would describe the operation as the substitution, for the conflict between classes, of a secondary or non-antagonistic contradiction within the hegemonic class itself, between two of its tendencies, the older colonial mentality and the newer techno- cratic one of post-independent neo-colonialism. I would argue that to repudiate these modernistic works of art, or, even more, to exercise, upon the silent and terroristic objects of the museum of modern cul- ture, the dramatic option of iconoclasm, is simply to reconfirm the reified prestige, and as it were the sacred aura, of these fetishized names and reputations. What is needed is rather something on the order of the psychoanalytic working through, yet now on the level of political and ideological content. Such a process can be expected to dissolve the reification of the great modernistic works, and to return these artistic and academic "monuments" to their original reality as the private languages of isolated individuals in a reified society. This is no doubt in many cases to destroy the works themselves in the process: only as a dream is destroyed by analysis, through exhausting its content along with its fascination and leaving a shell or husk to be discarded. It must no doubt also make us more uncomfortably aware of our own vested interest, as academic scholars, in preserving precisely these scholarly "objects of specialization" to which our own professional status is neces- sarily linked. Yet only through such a process of dereification and of working- through can we restore something of the fragility and the pathos of esthetic play as it stirs feebly and intermittently within the massive solidification of contemporary culture and media language. "Every masterpiece," Gertrude Stein once said, "came into the world with a measure of ugliness in it [... .] the sign of the creator's struggle to say a new thing in a new way [. ..] It's our business as critics to stand in front of [Raphael's Sistine Madonna] and recover its ugliness" [Gertrude Stein, Four in America (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1947), p. vii]. Ugliness, but also clumsiness, amateurishness, indecision . . . all so many sloppy brush-strokes that signal the dis- solution of the reified art-work back into its original praxis, that, freeing us from the spell of the artistic commodity, once more permit a just and fraternal evaluation of the real achievement, as well as of the dilemma, of the solitary and subjectivized artist in a capitalist world. 14</page></plain_text>
