Wood GM Current Engineering and Manufacturing Services Staff Warren, Ml ABSTRACT A laboratory sled test program was conducted to evaluate the effects of a lubri- cant on the inner surface of a windshield on occupant injury criteria and facial lacera- tions. These (5) tests simulated 49 km/h barrier impacts of a production vehicle with 2.29 - 0.95 - 2.29 mm windshield laminates. The lubricant in these tests was a 60,000 centistoke (0.06 m2/s) silicone fluid which was manually applied to the windshield prior to sled acceleration. Laceration levels were evaluated in terms of the number, length, and depth of cuts produced in the double-layer chamois skin head coverings on unbelted Hybrid III dummies. Laceration levels were reduced by two orders of magnitude from those experienced with uncoated windshields, though performance did not reach the zero laceration levels sometimes attained with Libby-Owens- Ford (L0F) and Securiflex laceration shield windshield treatments. However, of all the anti-lacerative treatments that were reviewed, the lubricant was the only one that was not based on permanent physical changes to the windshield design. Improvements were also noted in certain other dummy performance measures; HIC (Head Injury Criteria) was lowered by 20 percent and neck moment reduced by 65 percent. Additionally, it was found that values of neck moment correlate with the surface friction coefficients of the differ- ent windshield treatments. These findings suggest the potential for altering features of the head, neck, and upper torso kinematics by adjusting the frictional level of the inner surface of the windshield. EXCLUDING AREAS RELATED TO OPTICS, windshield safety performance has been traditionally judged in terms of three primary measures: penetration resistance, HIC (Head Injury Criteria), and severity of facial lacera- tions. The ideal windshield in terms of these measures would have high penetration resistance and a low value of HIC and would produce only minor (if any) facial laceration . Focussing on facial lacerations, we find that the introduction of the high penetration resistance (HPR) windshield in 1966 marked a near elimination of severe life-threatening levels of facial laceration (1).* These windshields, a cross section of which appears in Fig. 1, contain substantially thicker PVB (polyvinyl butyral) interlayers than their predecessors and carefully controlled levels of interply adhesion. These features combine Fig. 1 - Cross section of an HPR windshield. * Numbers within parentheses refer to references which are listed at the end of the paper. 6.282 0096-736X/86/9406-0282$02.50 Copyright 1986 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">851735 to provide the dramatically enhanced penetra- tion resistance of the HPR windshields. It is this high penetration resistance that pro- duces a dramatic reduction in severe life- threatening levels of facial laceration since these are principally associated with head passage through the windshield. Additional improvements in both materials and production methodology (1,2) have allowed progressive refinement of this concept from the original 3.18 - 0.76 - 3.18 mm HPR windshield intro- duced in 1966. Today, a multitude of thick- ness combinations exist, ranging from 1.78 - 0.95 - 1.78 mm to 2.54 - 0.76 - 2.54 mm, these being tailored to specific vehicle lines to provide desirable levels of optical, structural, acoustical, and safety performance. Accident statistics are frequently cited in support of efforts to reduce the remaining non-life-threatening levels of facial lacera- tion. Estimates of the number of annual incidents of windshield-induced facial lace- rations range between 55,600 and 179,000 (Appendix A). Though all of these estimates are well in excess of the annual passenger car death toll (24,000) (3), debate exists as to how much importance should really be attached to such lacerations given their low ranking on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) (4,5) (Appendix A) . In spite of this debate, efforts have proceeded since the late 1960s to develop innovative windshield designs which would reduce the incidence and severity of the remaining facial lacerations. Though some of these approaches appear promising, none has as of yet progressed beyond limited usage. Approaches developed to date can be grouped into three primary categories: windshields with tempered inner plies, asymmetrical wind- shields with thinner plies, and laceration shield windshields. Windshields with tem- pered inner plies include the Chemcor (6) by Corning, which has a chemically tempered inner ply, and the Triplex Ten-Twenty (7), which has a thermally tempered inner ply. The tempering of the inner ply causes it to break up into blunt, less lacerative pieces. However, because tempered glass has a higher breaking stress, it is necessary to introduce stress raisers in order to stay within acceptable limits of HIC. Asymmetrical wind- shields with thinner inner plies have been tested by many researchers (1,2,8). In gen- eral, the level of facial laceration has been found to decrease directly with decreases in the thickness of the inner ply (8). However, problems with sound transmission, handling of the windshields, and optical uniformity are made more pronounced by thinner inner plies. The addition of a laceration shield to the inner surface of a windshield has been shown to all but eliminate facial lacerations (9,10). Four- (9,10), five- (11), and three- ply (12) configurations have been developed, the latter utilizing only a single (outer) glass ply. Abrasion resistance, haze, mirror mounting, sticker removal, and added cost are special concerns associated with such treat- ments. However, European field experience with laceration shield windshields, though limited, has been quite favorable (10). Extensive U.S. field trials of laceration shield treatments are under way (four- ply) (13). All these approaches so far suggested involve modifications to the windshield. In the remaining sections of this report, an experimental approach is presented in which the lacerative potential of the windshield is reduced without any modification being made to the windshield itself. This approach involves the application of a lubricant to the inner surface of the windshield prior to head impact. It thus avoids the previously cited difficulties that are involved when permanent physical changes are built into the windshield design. WINDSHIELD LUBRICANT - Head impact with the current HPR windshield is illustrated schematically in Fig. 2. Throughout contact there can be significant motion of the head along as well as through the original plane of the windshield.

Adhesion between the PVB interlayer and the inner glass ply helps to maintain a regular orien- tation in the many small pieces of glass into which the inner ply has broken. In addition, the mating surfaces - head and broken wind- shield - are flexible. The soft facial tissues and broken glass/PVB matrix can both deform to accommodate small irregularities in 6.283</page><page sequence="3">interfacial geometry making sliding easier. Finally, contaminants are invariably present on the inner surface of the windshield, and viscous fluids are present on and within the facial tissues. These last two factors com- bine to allow the face to slide relatively freely along the windshield surface supported at least partially by a "lubricant" film. Only when broken edges of the inner glass are exposed and presented at acute angles to the skin surface (Fig. 3) should this natural elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication (14) break down and allow laceration-producing mechanical interaction of face and glass. Fig. 3 - Facial laceration by "acute" edges. Several different factors can contribute to this breakdown and onset of laceration. The first is loss of adhesion between a piece of glass and the PVB interlayer which allows the piece of glass to protrude significantly from the regular orientation of the glass surface. The remaining factors can be divided into two categories: (1) factors which tend to increase the interfacial coefficient of friction, and (2) factors which tend to increase the ploughing or form drag coefficient due to the forward movement of the head through the original undeformed surface of the glass. In the first category are the cleanliness of the inner surface of the windshield and the loss of the lubri- cating film from the surface of the skin due to the wiping action of the broken glass. The principal factors in the second category are forward movement of the head far beyond the original plane of the windshield surface coupled with a high relative velocity of the head parallel to the glass surface. In fact, at sufficiently high normal approach veloci- ties between head and windshield, the head will get far enough into the windshield for the ploughing effect to dominate. Even- tually, as displacement into the windshield increases, it becomes impossible for the pieces of the inner glass to retain a regular orientation. This can lead either to a slicing/tearing of the PVB interlayer allow- ing head penetration through the windshield or to chin engagement which would cause both a rapid linear deceleration and a rapid angu- lar acceleration of the head. The philosophy behind the experimental approach adopted here was to enhance the natural lubrication involved by adding a thick layer of high viscosity lubricant to the inner surface of the windshield just prior to head impact (Fig. 4). Such a lubri- cant would hopefully act to mask the cutting edges of all but the most irregularly oriented pieces of glass under all but the most severe impact conditions.* Fig. 4 - Head impact with a lubricated windshield. As indicated, an advantage inherent in the proposed experimental approach to lacera- tion reduction is that it necessitates no modifications to the windshield itself. Thus, the previously cited concerns with the laceration shield treatment and windshields with tempered and/or thinner inner plies are not encountered. Since it is a lubricant, however, a side effect of this film would be to reduce the interfacial coefficient of friction which could result in altered occupant kinematics. This point will be examined at greater detail in later sections of this report. * It is to be noted, however, that all known measures of reducing facial lacera- tion, including that proposed here, will not be as effective in cases in which the head passes through the windshield due to separation of the PVB interlayer, i.e., cases of extreme impact energies. 6.284</page><page sequence="4">851735 The remaining sections of this paper will be devoted to a description of the particular test configuration that was used in evaluat- ing this approach and to a discussion of test results and their implications in terms of overall vehicle interior design. SLED TEST PROCEDURE - Tests to evaluate the concept of a windshield lubricant were conducted on the two high-speed sled test facilities at the Safety Research and Development Laboratory, GM Proving Ground, Milford, Michigan. Tests simulated 49 km/h frontal barrier impacts without pitch. They involved sled bucks fabricated from bodies- in-white with production instrument panels and seats. Windshields were standard produc- tion 2.29 - 0.95 - 2.29 mm laminates. They were bonded in their frames using a poly- sulfide adhesive allowing cure times of approximately 48 hours to decrease the chance of debonding. The rake angle (angle with respect to the vertical) was 56°. Human sur- rogates were unrestrained Hybrid III dummies with double-layer chamois skin head cover- ings. A photograph of the test setup appears in Fig. 5. Laceration levels were evaluated Fig. 5 - Test buck with unrestrained Hybrid III dummy. using both direct subjective comparisons and the Triplex Laceration Index (TLI) (15). It is known that chamois coverings overestimate the level of facial laceration (16). How- ever, windshield treatments found to produce low levels of laceration on the chamois coverings should be equally effective when human faces are involved. The windshield lubricant used in this exploratory program was a 60,000 centistoke (0.06 nr/s) silicone fluid (GE Viscasil). This was chosen because of its very low toxicity, unusual chemical inertness, high temperature stability, and resistance to breakdown under mechanical shearing (17). Such a high viscosity was selected principally because the lubricant was manually applied to the windshield in this experimental study.* This manual appli- cation had to be performed approximately half an hour prior to the actual test run due to the safety interlocks built into the hydrau- lic circuitry of the test sled. Preliminary tests showed that only a lubricant of such high viscosity would maintain a relatively stable film on the windshield for this period of time. TEST RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Data was obtained from a total of six sled tests which were "identical" except for the windshield treatment. These tests involved, in total, four different windshield configurations, cross section schematics for which are sketched in Fig. 6a-d. The six * If lubricants with lower viscosities must be used in order to achieve higher application rates, proportional increases in the thickness of the applied film should keep results at levels achieved in this experimental study (18). 6.285</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 6 - Test windshield configurations. tests were divided as follows: single tests of the baseline, Securiflex, and LOF configu- rations, data for all of which were taken from the SRDL files; and three tests of the windshield lubricant (applied to the same standard windshield configuration that was used in the baseline tests). Data for the baseline configuration is actually from one of many tests of the baseline configuration and was picked because it was representative of the average performance. Prime interest in the present study, as indicated, was in the level of facial lacera- tion. Photographs of the chamois skin head covers used in each of these six tests appear in Figs. 7-12. Visual inspection shows a marked reduction in the severity of facial lacerations in all tests as compared to the baseline test. However, while performance is seen to have been improved in the lubricant tests, it is evident that it did not reach the almost zero laceration levels recorded with the two laceration shield treatments. In addition to this subjective comparison, we obtained a more quantitative measure of the differences by calculating the Triplex Lace- ration Index (TLI) in each case. For those Fig. 7 - Chamois skin head cover - baseline HPR windshield (Test N8520).

This index has been designed specifically to place more weight on severe lacerations. It has been set up so that a change of 1 unit in the TLI corre- sponds to an order of magnitude change in the total lacerative damage (15). Cases in which there are no lacerations penetrating the outer chamois take their TLI rating from the Corning Scale [19]. A TLI of 0 corresponds to no lacerations or abrasions, TLI = 1 allows for abrasions and nonpene- trating cuts less than 1.9 cm in length, and TLI = 2 applies to cases with abrasions and nonpenetrating cuts in excess of 1.9 cm. Using these equations and the data on the number and length of cuts that appears in Table 1, the values of the TLI for the four windshield treatments under consideration were found to be: TLI = 1.0 for the LOF laceration shield, TLI = 2.0 for the Securiflex laceration shield , TLI = 4.0 for the windshield lubricant (three test average), TLI =6.2 for the baseline windshield. Lacerations in the chamois corresponding to the tip of the nose were excluded in these calculations. Such lacerations appear only infrequently in the field (20), which sup- ports the contention that these occur in laboratory tests, at least in part, because of the unrepresentative stiffness of the nose on the Hybrid III dummy.* If chin lacera- tions are also excluded for the same reasons (20), the ratings for these four cases become, respectively, 1, 2, 3.6, and 5.7. As stated, a change of 1 in the TLI scale corresponds to an order of magnitude differ- ence in the lacerative damage. Thus, the reduction of over 2 points in TLI associated with the windshield lubricant clearly sug- gests its effectiveness in a laboratory set- ting as a measure for significantly reducing facial laceration. However, in addition, these results do confirm a conclusion of our earlier subjective evaluation, namely that the anti-lacerative performance of the lubri- cant does not match the "zero" laceration levels associated with the two laceration shield treatments. Besides supplying a permanent record of laceration potential in their chamois skin facial coverings, the Hybrid III dummies are instrumented to provide multiple additional measures of occupant safety performance. Common measures that are frequently refer- enced include HIC, chest g's, chest displace- ment (compression), neck moment (equivalent moment at the occipital condiles (21)), and left and right femur loads. A check was made of these additional safety performance mea- sures along with high-speed films of each test in order to learn of any side effects of using such a windshield lubricant. As an example, values of these six measures for the baseline and third lubricant tests are com- pared in Fig. 13. (Data from the third lubricant test are displayed and are con- sidered to be most representative because this was the only test of the lubricant in which there was both no laminate tearing and no loss of bond). In general, of all the common measures, HIC and neck moment were found to have the most direct relationship to * At least two other factors can contribute significantly to the unrepresentative number and severity of lacerations in the nose and chin area noted in laboratory tests with Hybrid II and III dummies. These are the higher levels of inter- facial friction and laceration-related mechanical drag present in the labora- tory. Field evidence indicates that actual contact is between dirty wind- shields and "greasy" foreheads (20). However, in the laboratory, windshields are invariably tested with clean surfaces using only slightly moistened chamois, i.e., at a higher level of interfacial friction. The increased mechanical or lacerative drag seen in the laboratory is associated with the higher cuttability of chamois coverings (16). Thus, in gene- ral, forehead friction levels are higher in the laboratory resulting in increased neck moments and head rotations. These in turn cause more of the face to contact the windshield glass producing unrepre- sentative lacerations of nose and chin. Consideration should be given to using dirty windshields and oily foreheads in future tests designed to measure the laceration potential of a windshield. 6.288</page><page sequence="8">851735 TABLE I Hybrid III Facial Laceration Data Outer Chamois Inner Chamois Number of Length of Number of Length of Test TLI Cuts Cuts (mm) Cuts Cuts (mm) 1st Lubricant (S7984) 3.2 (- Nose) 11 1 28 Nose 1 2 1 3 3.2 (- Nose, - Chin) 1 1 Chin 1 30 Nose 2nd Lubricant (N8517) 5.8 (- Nose) 11 13 1 6 1 61 Chin 4.7 (- Nose, - Chin) 1 1] 18/ 15 1 51 1 6 Chin 1 If Nose 1 7 ' 1 12 1 22, 2 1 ļ Nose 1 8 I 3rd Lubricant (S8028) 3.1 (-Nose) 1 2 1 2' Nose 1 3 Chin 1 3/ 2.8 (- Nose, - Chin) 1 1' 2 21 1 41 Nose 1 5 1 81 1 11 J Baseline .

In terms of HIC, the three special windshield treatments thus show comparable improvements in performance that border on being significantly better than the baseline configuration. However, only a limited number of tests were conducted. Thus, it is more accurate to state merely that these tests give support to the position that the three treatments tested have no adverse effect on HIC. This finding dis- agrees, but only slightly, with the results of an earlier, more extensive study (9) of Securiflex. In that study, HIC was found to be marginally higher with the Securiflex windshield. However, test conditions that were used in that study are felt to have been less representative of real world crashes. A Part 572 anthropomorphic test device (Hybrid II dummy) and modified (from production) instrument panels and seats were used in those earlier tests. These factors all should have contributed to produce signifi- cantly different (and less representative) dummy kinematics than those in the present test series. Let us now address the second measure, neck moment, that was found to be strongly affected by the windshield treatment. Both the lubricant and Securiflex treatments are seen in Table II to produce a significant reduction in neck moment as compared to the baseline value. Neck moment for the LOF treatment was found to be comparable to the baseline. Traces of the neck moment as a function of time for the four different wind- shield configurations appear in Fig. 14.

Fig. 15b - Head impact with lubricated windshield (S8028) film speed - 500 frames/s. head rotation that occurs while the head is in contact with the windshield. It also per- mits the forehead to travel further down the windshield. We have already seen that the lubricant reduces the level of facial lacera- tions, i.e., the mechanical (lacerative) drag portion of the interfacial friction between face and windshield. In addition, the basic coefficient of (sliding) friction between aligned glass and head surfaces is reduced by the presence of the lubricant through elasto- hydrodynamic lubrication (14). The only major force remaining that resists head motion parallel to the original plane of the windshield is a form drag or ploughing force. This force is present when the head form has passed beyond the original plane of the wind- shield. It reflects the resistance of the windshield to being forced out of the path- envelope inscribed by the moving head form. Figure 16 illustrates these three components of head-windshield friction.

The mechanical drag due to laceration and tearing of the soft facial tissue by pieces of the windshield glass is still effectively eliminated. However, the coefficient of (sliding) friction of the head-windshield interface could now conceivably be quite high being dependent on the material used for the laceration shield. 6.291</page><page sequence="11">An effort was made to better define how these three components of head-windshield friction contribute to the neck moment. We began by making best (subjective) estimates of the rank orderings for the three compo- nents of frictional force for the four wind- shield configurations. (The use of rank orderings was necessitated by the lack of absolute values.) These best estimates appear in Table III. Here the numbers 1 TABLE III Estimated Rank Ordering of Frictional Components Frictional Component Mechanical Surface (Lacerative Ploughing Component Drag) (Form Drag) Baseline 2 4 4 Lubricant 1 3 2 Securiflex 2 1 1 LOF 4 1 4 through 4 correspond to increasing levels of force, 4 being the highest. Mechanical (lacerative) drag ordering is based on mea- sured levels of laceration. Ploughing is based on film records of head displacement normal to the windshield, the highest values resulting from chin engagement. Surface com- ponents were ranked based on values measured with a modified tensile test machine. These values, appearing in Table IV, were measured in the laboratory using the procedure out- lined in Appendix B. TABLE IV Friction Coefficients of Windshield Treatments Friction Treatment Coefficient ( + .02) Baseline Ì .05 LOF 1.11* Securiflex 1.06 Lubricant 0.15 Returning to Table III, what general statements can be made about, the relative rankings of the combined components of head- windshield friction for the four listed wind- shield configurations? The rank orders of the three frictional components for the lubricant and Securiflex treatments are seen to be consistently equal to or lower than those for the baseline windshield. These two treatments would thus both be predicted to produce lower values of neck moment (assuming surface friction is a major contribution to this moment) than the baseline. This, as previously indicated, was indeed what was found (Table II). However, a prediction of the overall relative rankings of the baseline windshield and LOF laceration shield cannot be made just by visual inspection of the information in Table III. This is the case because of the inconsistencies in component rankings in these two windshield treatments. The most that can be said is that differences between the baseline and LOF treatments should be smaller than the differences between the baseline and either the lubricant or Securiflex treatments. This is indeed what was seen. A similar series of comments can also be made about the lubricant and Securiflex treatments which also display reversals in component rankings. An attempt was made to more clearly define/quantify the relationship between these three components of surface friction and the neck moment. A linear regression analysis (22) was proposed using the relative rankings in Table III as independent vari- ables and the level of neck moment as the dependent variable. Performance of this analysis required an additional relationship between the variables. This was obtained from a test of the Securiflex windshield treatment with a lubricant coating. Relative rankings for the components in this test were 1, 1, and 1. The neck moment was 38.0. It is recognized that such relative rankings are really quite poor indicators of the true nature of any functional relationship. The only "better quality" information that was available was the lacerative damage to the chamois skins and the data on friction coefficients in Table IV. The regression analysis was thus performed using values in Table IV in place of the surface component rank orderings and the values in Table VI - the combined length of all lacerations - in place of the mechanical (lacerative) drag rank orderings. Complete results of the regression analysis appear in Appendix C. The linear regression obtained using the sur- face friction coefficients in Table IV and data on lacerative damage in Table VI was Neck Moment - 9.2 + 13-9 C ^ + 6.37 C2 + 17.2 C3 (3) Here C-ļ, C2, and represent the surface component, the mechanical (lacerative) drag, and the ploughing (form drag) component of interfacial friction, respectively.

The R^ "coefficient of determination" (22) was 0.956, indicating a good fit of the data (Fig. 21). The three components defined previously thus do appear to affect neck moment. The results in Appendix C also show that, of the three components, the ploughing or form drag is by far the most strongly cor- related with the neck moment. In addition, the most strongly correlated components are the surface coefficient and ploughing or form drag. Additional testing is needed to fur- ther define these relationships. Finally, it should also be pointed out that relationship (3) is obviously not universal and only applies to the particular vehicle configura- tion and test conditions used in this exper- imental study. What is the significance of this neck moment in terms of occupant harm? Mertz and Patrick (21) indicate that it is the critical injury parameter for the neck in extension and in flexion, this having been found to be a most frequent neck injury mode (23). How- ever, Nusholtz et al. (23) recently reported that "flexion"-type neck injuries have little direct relationship to loads parallel to the mid-sagittal plane which is the component of load used to determine the neck moment. Debate also exists as to the percentage of total harm associated with neck injuries. Data in References 24 and 25 suggest that only a small percentage of total harm is associated with neck injuries, especially those resulting from head contact with the windshield (24). However, it has been sug- gested that this estimate of total harm is low in light of the potentially debilitating nature of neck injuries (25). Debate thus surrounds the issues of neck moment and neck injuries in general. How- ever, independent of these issues, there is another way in which the link between neck moment and windshield slipperiness might be beneficially utilized. This link affords the opportunity of favorably altering dummy kine- matics by adjusting the windshield frictional coefficient. The lubricant tests showed that head rotation and neck moment are reduced and head travel down the windshield increased by a reduction in the surface friction coeffi- cient. The opposite effects would be true of an increase in friction. It thus may be pos- sible to adjust certain elements of dummy kinematics, those of the head, neck, and upper torso, for a particular vehicular con- figuration - windshield installation angle, instrument panel geometry and stiffness, etc. - if changes can be practically made to the windshield which alter its frictional coefficient. The effects on the trajectories of both unrestrained and restrained occupants would, of course, have to be considered in such studies. Many new issues were thus opened by the work performed in this study. Further work is needed to determine whether the same improvement in laceration protection would occur without the silicone lubricant if the dummy headform had the same natural lubricity as the human head; to determine whether the added slipperiness might deflect the head into stiffer portions of the vehicle; to determine whether changes can be made in windshield glass and plastic composition to add a predetermined amount of slipperiness; and, if not, to determine whether it is really possible to apply the silicone to all areas of the windshield which an occupant's head might impact.

(24) to be responsible for 4.7? of the total harm to car occupants. Additional information on the safety performance of laminated wind- shields has appeared in many papers, includ- ing those by Huelke and Compton (3), Karlson (26), Mackay et al. (20,27), and Herman and Garrett (28). Data from these several sources allow various estimates to be made of the number of annual incidents of windshield- induced facial laceration. Using just the information provided by Huelke and Compton (3), which is derived from the National Crash Severity Study (NCSS) data base, one obtains an estimate of 127,600 annual incidents of windshield-related facial lacerations, abra- sions, and contusions. Calculations based solely on the data in the report by Herman and Garrett (28) give a higher estimate of 179,000. Finally, using just the data from Karlson (26), an estimate of 55,600 annual incidents of windshield-induced facial lace- ration is obtained. Though varying by a factor of 3, all of these estimates are well in excess of the annual passenger car death toll (24,000). In addition to the number of such incidents, injury severity is also a concern. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) (14) classified facial lacerations on its six- point Severity Code as being either AIS 1 (minor - single or multiple facial lacera- tions each &lt;5 cm in length) or AIS 2 (moder- ate - deep, into subcutaneous tissue and &gt;5 cm). All of the previously cited investi- gators (3,20,24,26,28) report that the major- ity of lacerations produced by today's laminated windshields are of AIS 1 severity. Huelke and Compton (3) place this at 95?. Karlson 's (26) data suggest a 70? - 30? divi- sion between AIS 1 and 2 once a conversion is made between her rating scale and the AIS. The data of Mackay and Smith (20) place a 34? upper limit on the number of facial lacera- tions of AIS level 2 though their five-point rating scale is not directly translated to AIS. Though their numbers are large, debate exists as to how much importance should really be attached to such lacerations given their low ranking on the AIS scale (5). One issue frequently brought up in such debates is what importance should be given to any change that occurs in quality of life because of the accident - such changes being, for example, a permanent disfigurement or loss of sight (4). A second issue is the problem of deciding what priorities to use in allocating the funds available for safety research and development. For example, should one base this choice on reduction of death alone or should other factors such as change in qual- ity of life be considered? Such issues are obviously complex and offer little hope for a general consensus. Individual researchers have made particular recommendations, how- ever. Both Karlson (26) and Mackay (20) support increased attention to eliminating windshield-induced facial lacerations. Karlson (26) bases this on the "costly medi- cal treatment and possible long-term dis- figurement" involved. Mackay and Smith (20) point to the possibly misleading nature of HIC in light of the few cases of closed head injuries of a decelerative nature due to windshield contact that have been noted in the field. On this basis, they suggest that windshields be judged more on the basis of laceration potential. Malliaris et al. (24) consider head-face interaction with the wind- shield a high-priority item. However, their goal is to reduce their "total harm" measure which places considerable, possibly even too much (29), emphasis on high AIS life- threatening injuries. Thus, no consensus currently exists even among researchers active in this field. APPENDIX B PROCEDURE FOR MEASURING WINDSHIELD SURFACE FRICTION - Test samples measuring 30.5 X 30.5 cm were obtained and prepared for each of the four windshield treatments. These were cleaned to eliminate any unwanted surface contaminants. They were then mounted horizontally as shown in Fig. 17 in an Fig. 17 - Overall view of surface friction test fixture. Instron Tensile Test Device. The Instron was specifically modified for these tests through the addition of the cable-pulley arrangement shown in Fig. 18. This setup allowed us to 6.295</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 18 - Close-up view showing slider-cable- pulley arrangement. measure the force needed to drag a weighted 6.4 X 6.4 cm square block covered with a double layer of moistened chamois skin (Fig. 19) across the specimen surface. Mea- Fig. 19 - Slider with double-layer chamois skin covering. surements were made at three different velo- cities - 0.25, 0.51, and 1.27 m/min - and four different loads - 774, 2587, 3039, and 4402 grams. The values of the friction coefficients appearing in Table IV were mea- sured for a velocity of 0.51 m/min and a load of 4402 grams. This combination was chosen because it gave the most stable results. Quoted results are the average of at least six runs. Examples of the force-displacement plots from which the required coefficients were taken appear in the background in Fig. 17 and again in Fig. 20. The upper limits for slip velocity and load in these experiments did not come close to the values present in actual head-windshield contact but represented instead the practical upper limits of the test device. However, within the ranges that we were able to investigate, little change was noted in the friction coefficients and the rank- ordering remained the same. Thus, while absolute values may be different under more representative test con- ditions, no change is expected to occur in the rank- ordering of the coefficients. Fur- ther study of this point is planned.

The rank-orderings in Table III were used, except that the friction coefficients in Table IV were used in place of the first column and the normalized laceration lengths in Table VI were used in place of the second column. Details of this regression analysis are con- tained in the computer output page which follows. The data set used in this analysis appears at the end of the second column of the output page.
