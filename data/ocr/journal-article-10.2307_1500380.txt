<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Black Gentleman: Manifestations of the Devil in Estonian Folk Religion. By Ulo Valk. Helsinki: Academia Scientiarum Fennica, Folklore Fellows Communication No. 276, 2001. Pp. 217, foreword, introduction, appendices, bibliography. N.p. paper. The Black Gentleman is the slightly revised English translation of Professor Ulo Valk's doctoral dissertation, originally written in Estonian and defended at the University of Tartu in 1994. The main thesis of the study, as stated in the foreword, is that Estonian folk belief is "an integral part of the folk religion of Christian Europe" (9). The reader may be allowed to interpret this looking westward for common historical roots as an expression of the political hopes of many Estonian intellectuals a few years after the fall of the Soviet Union. The point of a common cultural heritage is kept alive throughout the book, but above all Valk's study is a careful mapping of the morphology and distribution of a single folklore motif-the visual manifestations of the Devil in Estonian oral tradition. The study is based on 1,723 recorded texts (legends, memorates and belief accounts) from the Estonian Folklore Archives in Tartu. The Devil was the dominant supernatural being in Estonian folklore, having taken over the traits of about a dozen other supernatural creatures. In the material examined, there were five iiain manifestation forms of the Devil figure: anthropomorphic (59%), zoomorphic (21%), fantastic (15%), and as material object or natural phenomenon (5% combined). One chapter is devoted to describing different manifestations of the Devil's coach, two others to the Devil's ability to change shapes and cre- ate delusive sights.</page><page sequence="2">236 REVIEWS In the category "anthropomorphic being," the Devil not unexpect- edly shows himself as a man in 85% of the cases. A peculiar trait in Estonian tradition is that the Devil often takes the shape of a German gentleman. Valk argues that it is possible to speak of a demonization of Germans and landlords already in late medieval Estonia as well as a corresponding "Germanization" of the Devil. These processes, accord- ing to Valk, should be understood in connection with Estonians' early and bitter experiences of ruthless landlords, not seldom of German origin. As a beast, the Devil shows himself as all kinds of domestic and wild animals. It might sound somewhat surprising that the well-known image of the Devil as a human-like being with horns, hooves, tail and hairy body, grouped by Valk under the heading "fantastic," is less common (15%) than his appearance as an animal (21%). Perhaps the horned, hairy Devil belongs in the Christian iconographic universe and not in the oral tradition. As inanimate objects the Devil can take the form of, among many other things, a haystack, a ball, or flames of fire. Valk's study is based on statistical data and uses a quantitative method. His discussion, however, is situated far above any trivial and simplistic presentation of percentages and statistical figures. The text abounds with sharp-sighted reflections and informative commentaries, proving the author's thorough knowledge of his material, as well as a deep folkloristic learning. The reader is treated to comparisons with learned and popular traditions and with medieval Christian sources. The folklore of neighboring Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania is often addressed, as well as other European and non-European traditions. (Perhaps some comparisons with both folk-art and fine-art traditions could have added to the understanding of the visual manifestations in verbal art of a folklore figure.) There are extensive references to other relevant scholarly publications. As in the example above with the German landlords, Valk in many cases takes the opportunity to discuss the possible connections between the formation of tradition and the social and cultural characteristics of the society from which it emerged. One might ask whether it is not hopelessly outdated, in the year 2001, to publish a statistically based survey of the morphology of one folklore motif, appearing in texts recorded in the late nineteenth and early twen- tieth centuries. My answer to that question would be that a deep famil- iarity with and a thorough understanding of the empirical material have always constituted the firm ground for the science of folkloristics.
