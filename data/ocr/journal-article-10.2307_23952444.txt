<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND STUDIES 247 THE VEDAS AND UPANISADS1 The Vedic and Upanisad literature is of great extent and difficulty. It constitutes the background and basis of all subsequent develope ments in Hindu religion and philosophy. Its status became a theme for discussion and a dogma; its practical applications extended to all departments of life; and its exegesis provided occupation for multitudes of theologians, ritualists, cosmologists, grammarians, lexicographers, metrists. For European scholars, again, these earliest Indian docu ments, constituting one of the most ancient known literatures, speedily developed connexions beyond their own Indian horizon and with still remoter times. Overleaping the immediate unmistakable affinities with the earliest Persian writings and with the ' Arian Periodthe Rg Veda Veda became a precious record of Indo-European thought and even a revelation of primitive tendencies of human reflexion upon life and the universe. Until comparison of religious and mythological ideas came to operate over an unlimited field, it was the chief resort of mythological theories. At the present time the situation is, on the Indian side, considerably changed and, we may say, alleviated. By reason of the publication of most of the Vedic texts and the translation of many of them, and through the enormous amount of philological investigation which has been brought to bear upon them, the distinction between the Veda itself and the later developements has become fairly definite. The Veda is almost exclusively sacerdotal. The Rg-Veda itself is in the main a compilation of hymns composed for use in actual rites, and the same practical purpose attaches even more definitely to the Sama Veda Veda and the Yajur- Veda : the Atharva- Veda differs only in the more private and multifarious character of its largely magical rituals and in their later Brahmanization. The Brdhmanas are descriptions and dis cussions of ritual, intended only for priestly study; and even the speculations of the Upanisads, though they manifest contact with thinkers not of the Brahman caste, have their starting-point in the ideas and interests of the priestly schools. But, while thus the Vedic litera ture stands out with a well-defined character, this very fact involves problems, and there are others too which await solution. Since the Veda itself refers to more mundane kinds of composition, such as 1 The Religion and Philosophy of the Vedas and Upanishads, by Arthur Berriedale Keith. D.C.L., D.Litt.

As always in Indian history, the developements take place behind the scenes and emerge in full maturity. Secondly, the Brahmanical literature itself testifies to a hardening in the character and status of the priest himself: the poet priest of the early age, a member of some professional family not very rigidly separated from the general community, has in becoming a commentator and theorist, or inventor, of ritual undergone a change no less marked than his gods themselves, once lauded and flattered for their favours, now mere agents controlled by the all-powerful rites. What force was it that impelled the competing families to pool the several collections of hymns, which were their stock-in-trade ? and how was first organized the trade union which provided students and teachers of the joint compilation, the Rg- Veda ? Was this an outcome of spontaneous fusion, or editorial redaction, or royal influence? In any case it ante-dates all other Indian literature. The last problem concerns the hymns themselves and their composers. The hymns of the Rg-Veda are not quite like anything found elsewhere. Despite their recurrent ideas and the con ventional phraseology of ancient compositions, they contain not a little poetry. Their spirit is natural and manly. There was, no doubt, already a considerable developement of ritual and a subdivision of functions among the priests ; but the rites are performed on behalf of wealthy patrons, who themselves take part. What the priest requires is his dues: his personality is not obtruded, and there is no sign of Shamanistic ecstasy. Thus the tone is impersonal. The object of the performance is to secure for the patron, the company, and the priests, benefits largely mundane, such as wealth, cattle, and strong sons. The faith in its efficacy is of a natural order ; the appeal is to the gods, whose favour is solicited by praise, recital of their deeds, and supplica tion : and thus the magical character which entirely dominates the later ritual is not on the surface apparent. Furthermore, there seem to be few, if any, horrors: the ' we have drunk the soma, we have become immortal' of the Soma rite does not appear to imply an orgy. Deep ethical feeling, a sense of sin, is confined to the hymns to Varuna: owing to less developed anthropomorphism the morality of the gods is not so much provocative of question as in the case of the Olympians. Thus the problem of the Vedic hymns is how in a society settled, but warlike and still tribady organized, without temples or, apparently, cities, there was maintained a semi-public religion, served by a rather</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND STUDIES 249 numerous, professional, somewhat level-headed, and non-orgiastic priest hood. This clearly implies a civilization and also a religion which had a practical value for the community. What was the character of that religion ? The old view that it was in the main a nature-worship, with a mythology based upon personifica tion and metaphor, encounters at the present day a certain impatience on the part of anthropological theorists eager to find exemplification. Instead of shedding light upon early thought, the Vedic religion must be scrutinized or excavated for vestiges of taboo, totemism, theriolatry, the corn-spirit, sonder-gotter, sympathetic magic, animatism, mana, dei fication. In order that these wide vistas may not obscure the im mediate terrain, it is necessary to keep in close touch with the actual texts. Origins, again, are one thing, actualities another. How are we to say, for instance, that such and such a rite is fertility magic, if the par ticipant was unconscious of such reference ? The matter is, however, difficult. Working beliefs are themselves only transient interpretations of tradition and usage, and the believer is himself controlled by tendencies wider than he knows and often illudes himself, in fact, as to what he believes. His interpretations are perversions of older interpretations which had been perversions of others still more remote. Until the science of religions contrives a calculus, logic, or method, capable of incorporating with the general processes the transient, fluctuating, and diverse under standings of conscious individuals and groups, it must always (like the other sociological sciences) evoke protests from each of the special departments to which it may be applied. In the Vedic religion a worship of nature is unquestionably the leading feature. No theorist would deny that the hymns to the dawn, to fire (Agni), to the sun, the winds, the waters, the rain-god (Parjanya), the sky, night, the forest goddess are in fact addressed to those pheno mena, conceived in various degrees as persons or powers. Few, perhaps, would deny that Indra has at any rate some connexion with storm and lightning, Mitra with the sun, Varuna with the nocturnal sky, a connexion more intimate than that of poetic or religious imagery. But here the dubious terrain begins : for these three deities a different origin has, in fact, been propounded. Then there are cases where, while a natural origin is certain, as for the Nasatyas and Apam Napat, it is remote and the expression is so indeterminate, that we may doubt what natural phenomenon was conceived. In other instances we have functional powers, Savitar, Visvakarman, Tvastr, Brahmanaspati, Praja pati, whose naturalistic attributes or myths are due, no doubt, to asso ciation, emulation or fashion. This, indeed, implies that the natural phenomena were near to the thought of the worshipper; and a like lesson is conveyed by the fact that the very same objects which</page><page sequence="4">250 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES ordinarily figure under divine designations are in other or later texts invoked by their workaday names. A worship of thinly veiled natural powers demands a more obvious social utility than does that of highly personalized Olympians. The Vedic Indians were far removed from the stage in which Thaumas alone could give birth to Iris. But the storm, the waters, the sun, fire, and wind are by no means so remote from the economic consciousness of the Indian peasant as from that of the European citizen. Even the dawn goddess, felt to be the most poetic of the Vedic divinities, had a part to play in the daily communal awakening of the village folk: was not the Prabhata-stotra, the morning hymn, a part of the equip ment of the chief sects in far later times ? This explains, perhaps, why the Vedic hymns have so little to do with agriculture or the whole group of primitive ideas associated therewith. The Aryan was origin ally not agricultural, but pastoral, and the tradition of this long survived. His wealth was in horses and kine, which possibly owed to him their first introduction into India : even these, abundantly em ployed in religious imagery, received, it seems, but little of direct worship : and it is possible that the Sudra of later date, when he first deified the cow, was really awed by the cow's Aryan owner. These few preliminaries may suffice to shew that the Vedic religion, even in its earliest form, can by no means be expounded by mere description, which itself would be no light matter. It involves a dis cussion of many problems, both in and beyond the Indian sphere. The immediately following period witnessed an entire transformation of that religion, in the course of which a number of old or indigenous conceptions, which had underlain the earlier faith, rose to the surface and became the main working ideas, while the nature deities were subordinated to great gods of a new kind, and a theistic conception gradually shaped itself. All this comes within the scope of the treatise by Professor Berriedale Keith which is the occasion of this article :—a treatise of such character and compass as in the case of an ordinary scholar might well be the crown of a life's work. So also does the discussion of views and practices relating to burial and the life after death and the immensely com plicated and elaborate ritual, hardly paralleled elsewhere. After disposing of these matters Professor Keith turns with undiminished vigour to the consideration of the whole developement of philosophical ideas in early India, and at the end retains still enough energy for dealing, in appendices, with a number of interesting and important questions. Professor Keith's readers will not delude themselves with the thought that he is dealing with a new subject. So abundant and so remarkably varied are the references that he will rather feel that, failing all other</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND STUDIES 251 merits, the book would still serve as an excellent bibliography of the several topics. It may be convenient to indicate briefly the situation into which the new treatise is introduced. Ignoring, but not, it is to be hoped, forgetting the early studies in the several departments and also the mass of editions, translations, and special works of research or original scholarship, it may be said that for most of the topics we have exposi tions which are also, in varying measure, works of research of the same kind as in the case of the Greek and Latin Classics : in some instances the stage of compendiums has been reached. Of the last-named order are the volumes in the Encyclopaedia of Indo-Aryan Research (Grundriss derder Indo-Arischen Philologie) relating to Vedic Mythology (Macdonell), the Atharva- Veda (Bloomfield), Ritual Literature (Hillebrandt), where experienced scholars formulate, in some cases for the first time, but upon a more or less common plan, and with bibliographical care, the total knowledge of the subject in existence at the time. Of a more personal character are such works as Hillebrandt's Vedische Mythologie, Barth's Religions de VInde, Hopkins's Religions of India, Oldenberg's Religion Religion des Veda, Die Weltanschauung der Brahmanatexte, Die Lehre der der Upanishaden, and, in the department of philosophy, the histories of Indian philosophy by Deussen, Suali, Dasgupta, Radhakrishna, Ranade, and others. Here the old and new matter is more moulded by the experienced insight, views, or even doctrines of the author, sometimes, as in the case of the writings of Barth and Oldenberg, with marked critical power, originality or distinction of thought. The studies relating to early India are still far from the stage where originality is reduced to minutiae or devices of presentation and a new book on some topic may be simply a new book on that topic. Although in the immense productivity of Professor Keith's pen, in more than one study, these two volumes on the earliest Indian religion and philosophy can hardly be discriminated as the culmination, they may be regarded as completing an activity as a Vedic scholar which is amply sufficient to provide it with a wide and firm basis. Joint author with his teacher Professor Macdonell of a valuable dictionary of Vedic names and subjects, he has given us the first translation of a most difficult work, the Taittirlya-samhita, a recension of the second most important Veda, the Yajur-Veda. The two chief Brahmanas of the Rg- Veda, the Ailareya-Brdhmana and the Kausitaki-Brahmana, have likewise been translated by him; while in the department of the mystico-philosophical literature he has also given a rendering of the Sankhayana-AranyakaSankhayana-Aranyaka and a text and translation of the Aitareya Aranyaha,Aranyaha, the two texts of the Rg-veda school. All these are equipped with valuable notes, full introductory discussions of relevant matters, and indices. They are works of independent and primary character.</page><page sequence="6">252 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES Passing over his Indian Mythology and his publications relating to later Indian literature and philosophies, and also much else, we cannot omit to mention that in the capacity of a skilful cataloguer of MSS Pro fessor Keith has had a more extensive first-hand acquaintance with Sanskrit texts, in their multifarious and difficult forms and scripts, than almost any living scholar. Those who have followed this pheno menal activity are well aware that it is not infected with any degree of superficiality, and that the strong front that Professor Keith maintains in the face of other views is based upon direct contact with the materials. In its general tendency the present work is rather on the conservative side. As the author never fails to take note of all that has been suggested in regard to each topic, the reader will not go far before he realizes with some bewilderment how many things have been weakly suggested (it is the vice of scholars) and how trenchantly they can be met. This does not mean that the main tenour of the treatise is not expository (and that with an amazing wealth of particulars); but the exposition is attended from point to point by discussions of the views and interpretations which have been propounded in these several con nexions. The treatise is divided into five parts, entitled, I, The Sources ; II, The Gods and Demons of the Veda; III, The Vedic Ritual; IV, The Spirits of the Dead ; V, The Philosophy of the Veda; while the eight appendices contain discussions of special questions or theories relating to the Age of the A vesta and the Rg- Veda, the Sacrifice of Purusa and the origin of the world, the Aryan conception of the heaven, the drink of immortality, the Indo-European fire-cult, cremation and burial, the Dravidian element in Indian thought, Pythagoras and Parmenides. In Part I, which naturally is introductory, we have beside the necessary examination of the evidences concerning the date of the first Aryan settlements in India and their situation at the time when the hymns of the Rg-Veda were composed, a general survey of the Sanskrit literary sources, followed by a consideration of the light derivable from extra-Indian sources, such as the Iranian Avesta, Indo-European and other comparative mythology, general theories concerning the origin of religions; further, of possible effects of fusion with indigenous races and religions, and of the popular or hieratic character of the Vedic religion. While there is much that is common to the Rg- Veda and the Avesta,Avesta, and comparative Indo-European mythology proves the antiquity of at least some divine names and attributes, the general theories are all one-sided or mistaken, and the Euhemeristic doctrine in particular presents absurdities in the Indian sphere: none of the doctrines furnishes a proper basis for a classification of the Vedic pantheon.</page><page sequence="7">NOTES AND STUDIES 253 The question of mixture of races and beliefs is obscured by our total ignorance of pre-Aryan India (an ignorance somewhat mitigated by recent notable discoveries in archaeology), while in regard to a supposed hieratic character of the Vedic religion it is necessary to guard against exaggeration. In the composition of the Rg-Veda the attempt of the late Professor Ε. V. Arnold to distinguish the hymns of five different periods involves impossible consequences. In Part II we have the main descriptions of the characters, functions, and mythology of the divine and other powers, which are classified as Celestial, Aerial, Terrestrial, Minor Gods of Nature, Abstract Deities and Sonder-gotter, Groups of Deities, Priests and Heroes, and Demons. Many particular questions arise in regard to the origin and functions of individual divinities, for instance Varuna (whose ethical associations have been referred by Oldenberg to a Semitic origin), Brhaspati and Rudra : and the views of Hillebrandt, who in the cult of Soma and several other figures found evidences of moon-worship, are frequently criticized. While the main features of most Vedic Divinities are hardly disputable, their origins may be open to diverse speculations. Concerning the abstract deities and functional powers not many questions arise, though the relation of Savitar to Surya, the actual Sun, requires to be clearly discriminated, and the creator gods, such as Prajapati and Brahman, little evidenced in the earlier Veda, are to be marked in view of their significance at later stages. The minor figures and groups, such as Rbhus and Gandharvas, have in part a very remote ancestry : other groups, such as those of the Adityas and Asuras, are developements from the Indo-Iranian period ; but the demonization of the latter, which was accompanied by a change in the character of several minor powers, was a purely Indian metamorphosis. A house spirit and a tree spirit are the chief representatives of spirit worship; nor is there much evidence of direct animal worship (though there are one or two divine animals), and totemism is altogether unproved. The preliminary matters considered in this section include the degree of anthropomorphism in the Vedic divinities, which varies from case to case, but is definitely less than with the Olympians; theriomorphism, which is not prominent; animatism and abstract divinities ; fetishism ; animism and the spirits of the dead; cosmology and cosmogony (the latter not noticeable until the close of the Rg-Veda period) and the conception of rta, the Avestic asa, physical and moral order in the universe; further, the interrelations of the gods, who do not form a family in the same way as the Olympians, but appear in certain pairs and groups and assume each other's attributes or preeminence, on the lines of Max Midler's Kathenotheism. Syncretism may account in some instances for plurality of forms or names of one and the same deity.</page><page sequence="8">254 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES The chapters relating to ritual are based chiefly upon the later Samhitas, the Brahmanas and the Sutras: because the Rg- Veda is too little informative concerning the ceremonies for which the hymns were designed. The position adopted by Professor Keith is that, while in the Rg- Veda the offering is predominantly a gift, which conception is not necessarily posterior to that of slaying for the purpose of securing propagation of vegetables and animals, the ideas of sacramental com munion and ecstatic enjoyment do not fail to appear. Magical opera tion of sacrificial rites, which was not wanting in Vedic conception, becomes in the Brahmanas the dominant idea, every action in the rite producing a mechanical effect. The gods continue to be invoked, and new ones also are brought into play; but the response is affected by the controlling force of the rite. Thus the gods become, what in magic proper they are ab initio, nearly otiose, so that the later Purva-Mlmamsa system was, in fact, atheistic. This remarkable developement seems clearly to be due to penetration from a different stratum of the religion, which is so abundantly exemplified in the charms and spells of the Atharva-Atharva- Veda. Other features appearing in the ritual are connected with the purging of sin, asceticism (tapas) and initiations (diksa), along with special abstentions and taboos. In the choice of offerings as similation plays a part: of actual human sacrifice there is in Vedic times no real evidence, though it is included in the Brahmanical theories. The chief offering is the Soma juice, and in most performances, public and domestic, the fires play the leading part. In regard to the dead (Part IV) the chief topics are their state and abodes, the disposal of the body and remains, and the respect accorded in domestic and hieratic ritual. While heaven is conceived as the normal destination of the departed spirit, the idea of places of punish ment goes back at least to Indo-Iranian times, as does also the person of of Yama or Yima, the first, or king, of those who have passed away. The stages whereby the last abode is reached, and the incidents on the way, are sometimes referred to in the Veda or described in the Upanisads; and there is an old and rather obscure discrimination of the 'way of the gods' (deva-yana) and 'the way of the fathers' (pitr vana),vana), which in the Upanisads is apt to be detailed in astronomical or cosmological terms. Certainly, as appears from such texts as the Pali Peta-vatthu,Peta-vatthu, there was more of belief in disembodied spirits remaining on earth than ordinarily appears in the Brahmanic writings. In general the attitude towards the living is one of friendship: in the regular monthly, quadrimensual, annual, and other rites, when the spirits come to receive offerings from their descendants, the only danger is from possible malign interlopers. The disposal of the remains is ordinarily by fire; but the burial of the body, or a remnant of it, is at no period</page><page sequence="9">NOTES AND STUDIES 255 unknown, and the usages provide no ground for ethnological inferences. The subsequent erection of a memorial mound is enacted : the idea of providing the dead person with objects required for his future existence or with companions, such as wives and servants, does not appear in the Veda. On such a subject as the philosophy of the Veda (Part V) it is very difficult to produce new information. The chief texts have long been rather widely read (in translations) even outside Indianist and philoso phical circles. An Upanisad was translated by Sir William Jones, and some information concerning Indian philosophical ideas is contained in the Greek and Latin Classics, not to mention the precise knowledge acquired in later times by the Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetans, or the vague ideas apprehended by the Persians, Arabs, &amp;c. Since the time of Colebrooke we have had sufficiently definite statements of the main tenets of the several recognized schools of later philosophy. The philosophic and cosmological hymns of the Eg- Veda and Atharva- Veda, some of them for a long time previously favourite specimens of early Indian literature, were collected in an admirable monograph by Pro fessor Lucian Scherman. The last really original contribution to the subject of Vedic philosophy is the study of the middle, Brdhmana, period by Professor Oldenberg, whose Buddha had long before given the most felicitous presentation of the Atman and Brahman doctrines. The question as to the origin of theism proper in India has acquired a due prominence through Professor Jacobi's essay entitled Die Ent wicklungwicklung der Gottesidee bei den Jndern. Needless to refer to the numerous general studies of the philosophy of the Upanisads by Gough, Deussen, and others, or to the systematic histories of Indian philosophy as a whole. One of the most valuable of all the comprehensive works is the translation of the Sarva-darsana-samgraha by Cowell and Gough. Of the two opposite tendencies of modern critics, one of which is to interpret into Vedic thought the philosophic ideas of later times and the other to explain away the prima facie resemblances by exhibit ing relations to primitive thought, the latter affords more scope to the scholar and more satisfaction to the amour-propre of the modern. It may, however, be considered that the philosophical idea is one thing, the stage of scientific knowledge or logical and psychological discrimina tion with which it is associated another. Substantially the same outlook may recur in a changed intellectual or ethical milieu. Perhaps the justest attitude to this problem is to be found in the writings of Olden berg, although even there we may occasionally feel that something is urged against the ancient Indian which might almost be charged against the modern European. Even logic must revolt from comparing the ideals of one society with the unreflecting admissions of another.</page><page sequence="10">256 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES We We have not generally, Professor Keith reminds us, for early Indian speculations the advantage (as in the case of the Greek) of being able to associate particular ideas with successive individual thinkers. Hence the Upanisads are apt to impress us as medleys of inconsistent experi ments on various levels of thought. But most scholars would agree in tracing through the Brahmanas and Upanisads a general tendency: the creator-god Prajapati comes to be replaced by the impersonal quasi-spiritual force brahman, while the two conceptions of atman 'self' and prana ' breath' become subliminated and acquire, the former pre eminently, a noetic character. The definite identification of the two ultimates, in the ' that art thou' of the Upanisad, produces the Vedantic pantheism, while the negation ' It is not י (A or anything else that can be named or thought) foreshadows the illusionist form of that doctrine. From the same Upanisads we have to derive another of the early systems, the Samkhya, and probably also the theist doctrine of the Yoga, which Professor Jacob! has perhaps proved to have been the original exponent of real theism in India. To the same period belongs the (to us untraceable) developement of the Indian trinity of great gods, Brahma, Visnu, and £iva, of whom in the sequel the former was unable to maintain his prominence, while the other two had to come to terms with all the three philosophies. Professor Keith distinguishes the ' Theosophy of the Brahmanas' from the ' Philosophy of the Upanisads', including under the former, however, not only the ' doctrine of the sacrifice' and the ' ethics of the Brahmanas', but also the modes of thought and categories which are exemplified therein. The gradual clarification of psychological and logical distinctions is very well exhibited in the work of Professor Oldenberg ; and Professor Keith proceeds upon similar lines. In ethics he finds on the Indian side, as compared with Iranian, arrested developement. Even the doctrine of truth has partly a ritual aspect, as has morality (purity) in general. The actual morals of the books are not seldom unedifying. On the other hand, there is absence of many crimes committed in other rituals: the abominations are few, though conspicuous : there is a developement in ideas of good and evil, though no controlling conception. Political philosophy is wholly absent. In regard to the Upanisads we have to consider questions of date (where much depends upon comparison with eatly Buddhist and Jaina tenets), classification, and interpretation. Professor-Keith holds that, though the general teaching is more in accord with Ramanuja's Vedanta than with that of Samkara, yet some schools of Vedanta descended from Yajhavalkya furnished a real foundation for the Samkara view. While in logic no serious advance can be traced in the Upanisads, the problem and conditions of knowledge became somewhat</page><page sequence="11">NOTES AND STUDIES 257 prominent, more especially as the examination of the faculties tended to shew their successive importance for the apprehension of the absolute, as it shaped itself: indeed, it became a problem how the knowledge of it, if it were approachable only by knowing, could be attained at all, and in the end it could be expressed only by silence. The view of the universe as an evolution from the absolute, the cosmogonic view (which in later times was termed parinama) and the view of it as an illusion (the later vivarta) correspond obviously to different stages in the conception of the absolute itself. None the less the two views have also a genetic connexion with the old cosmogonies and with the ancient idea of the delusive or magical powers of the great gods. The Pantheistic notion may lead to Atheism; but in point of fact Atheism appears chiefly in another system, the Samkhya, the deri vation of which from the Upanisads has been the subject of a variety of theories. In a long section devoted to this subject, the view of Dahlmann and others, who posit an earlier theistic Samkhya, and that of Jacobi and Stcherbatsky, who conceive the Samkhya to result from the discrimination of a metaphysical non-psychological ego, come in for examination. Professor Keith then proceeds to investigate the relation of the supreme and individual souls; psychological analysis; concep tions of time, space, and causality: the four states of the soul (waking, dreaming, dreamless sleep, and the ' fourth'); the doctrine of trans migration (first traced in the Brhad-Aranyaka Upanisad) and that of karmankarman; the way of salvation and the life stages ; ascetic practices and religious suicide. The last two sections deal with the significance of the philosophy of the Upanisads and with 'Greece and the Philosophy of India Here we have first a summing up, in which a comparison of Upanisad views with Kantian idealism is denied, while their intel lectual and ethical deficiencies are emphasized (though actual immoral consequences in ancient times are not always alleged) and the literary, mystical, and a certain general, value is allowed : secondly, an examina tion of the various instances in which influence of Indian ideas upon the Greeks (Parmenides, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Plato, Porphyry) has been by Garbe and others (mistakenly, as Professor Keith urges) alleged. It would not be possible, or expected, on the part of a reviewer, that he should make known, or even discover, precisely how far he can concur in the always straightforward and definite, but rapid argumenta tion and in the refutations or rejections included in the chapters so inadequately here outlined. But we may hope that among the attractions of the Upanisads, which in fact are imperishable world litera ture, Professor Keith would be prepared to recognize a certain unique accent, which may be detected also in occasional passages of the VOL. XXXI, S</page><page sequence="12">258 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES Brahmanas, an earnestness which is not ethical or strictly intellectual, but that of a man communicating to a friend and pupil supernormal truths which are to him of the uttermost concern. The mass and variety of information and discussions contained in these two fine volumes compel something more than admiration of the author's reading and his powers. While the general outcome is, as we have mentioned, on the conservative side, it may well be believed that no developed theory, or even suggestion, in the field has passed un noticed. It seems unlikely, and the author has rendered it unnecessary, that the same ground should ever again be covered in this manner. The future progress of Vedic studies may be by way of following, as new points of light reveal themselves, particular lines of enquiry leading back from the earliest historical data. F. W.
