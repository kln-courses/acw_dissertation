<plain_text><page sequence="1">(En)gendering Artificial Intelligence in Cyberspace SABINE HEUSER Universi!y of Marburg Cyberspace or some version of virtual reality is what makes cyberpunk a new subgenre within the force field of science fiction. This unique time-space continuum, or 'chronotope', is an essentially postmodern device for portraying worlds within worlds. 1 Yet these virtual worlds are portrayed using realist narra tive conventions, a common technique to make the strange new worlds of SF credible, to make the strange seem familiar, knowable. By means of this strategy it is also possible to foreground the construction of these other, alter native worlds, as well as the process of how they are imagined, created, and realized as fictional worlds, without the need to resort to narrative interven tion, a strategy that I regard as going against the predominant SF genre conventions. Much has been written about the different versions of virtual reality in cyberpunk, but little attention has been paid to the characters who thrive in this computer-generated, fictional space and how they come about. This also applies to artificial intelligences as a special group of characters. In a sense, cyberspace begets or engenders its virtual creatures. What intrigues me in particular is which cognitive processes are employed by readers when imag ining these purely fictional life forms, and what role does our knowledge of the real world play in the process, especially with regard to gender characteristics. Theoretically speaking, artificial intelligences need have no gender character istics at all; nonetheless, they often do display gendered features or gender specific behaviour. The very term 'artificial intelligence' (Al) can be considered as an oxymoron. If intelligence is, by definition, a characteristic of rational human beings, how, then, can it be artificial, constructed, maybe even man-made? On a cultural level, the term also reveals the anthropocentrism inherent in the notion of machine intelligence, namely, that the computer has to emulate or simulate, or at the very least impersonate, the workings of the human intellect. Perhaps Als are also an expression of the human race's dream to perpetuate and recreate itself without the limitations of the human body as reproductive organ. AIs are 1 For a more detailed discussion of the notion of chronotope in SF see Darko Suvin, Metamorphoses of Science Fiction: On the Poetics and History of a Literary Genre (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1979); and for its function with regard to cyberpunk see Sabine Heuser, Virtual Geographies: Cyberpunk at the Intersection of the Post modern and Science Fiction (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2003).</page><page sequence="2">130 (En)gendering Artificial Intelligence closely related to the evolution of other human-machine hybrids in SF such as robots, androids, and cyborgs. AMs dwell in cyberspace in ever increasing numbers, but they have not been discerned in the actual world of science yet the Turing test has always proven them impostors. AIs are particularly interesting fictional constructs that inhabit and emerge from computer-generated virtual environments. As potential fictional characters AMs are fascinating creatures, chimera born of human and machine at least in terms of semantics. They allow me to investigate some narrative issues with regard to character formation without running the risk of mistaking them for representations of someone real; they have no signifieds in the actual world as we know it. As merely virtual fictional beings they can serve to illustrate certain cognitive processes involved in constructing meaning; in other words, how we as readers make sense of verbal artefacts, how we impute meaning to them, and how these processes involve gender traits. In terms of narrative, it is impossible to separate setting from action and character.2 But which term is deemed more complex represents a value criterion on the basis of which so-called 'high' literature is distinguished from 'low', formulaic forms such as science fiction. Yet, as Martin Wallace succinctly summarizes, characters consist of more than mere 'verbal scraps (physical appearance, thoughts, statements, feelings) held loosely together by a proper name'.3 He concurs with Martin Price in stating that 'fictional characters are purely imaginary constructs, with no relationship to reality', and continues to point out that we use our knowledge of the world as well as all textual pieces of information to form a 'conjectural configuration' of a character, much in the same way as we collect information about real persons.4 Characters are constructed during the process of reading and are always subject to change. The characteristics that readers ascribe to the construct of a person accrete from the mentioning of a proper name, from the attribution of words as well as physical qualities, certain modes of behaviour, even emotional responses to these names. In the process of fleshing out the contours of a virtual character, readers always use their knowledge of the real world and how to operate in it in order to impute meaning to these constructs. Extra-textual knowledge of the world, even the mentioning of such simple physical coordi nates as 'up' or 'down', contributes to the construction of a virtual world, or any 2 Martin Wallace provides a concise overview of the interdependence of character within the discipline of narratology in 'The Composition of Character', in Recent Theories of Narrative (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1986), pp. 116?22.

As Gwyneth Jones explains from a writer's perspective, 'the aliens we imagine are always other humans in disguise' and they ineluctably 'speak human'.6 If an Al spoke its machine language, it would sputter forth binary code, which would not make for very entertaining reading. We ultimately lack the language to describe some thing truly alien. Thus the portrayal of artificial intelligence ultimately always incorporates a human dimension, which, ironically, renders the artificial more human in the process. This being said, it is interesting to see which parts of our knowledge we bring to the text, and how we are steered by the narrative to project them on to the fictional characters. Plot and character in most cyberpunk novels are intricately related but merely serve as a means of foregrounding the richly detailed world inside the computer adjacent to the post-apocalyptic, gritty, urban zones outside. Generally speaking, characters in cyberpunk and cyberspace are not very complex; they are more akin to cardboard cut-outs, irrespective of whether they are supposed to repre sent flesh-and-blood persons or disembodied virtual entities. The typical protagonist is usually a young white male versed in the hard-boiled lingo of the hacker underworld. He is frequently caught in a double bind between two larger-than-life entities, be they multi-national mega-corporations, or other Byzantine networks of power. He lives for the thrill, the adrenaline rush created by a near-death experience in cyberspace. In fact, he lives for the very explo ration of cyberspace, the matrix, the latest final frontier. The template from which many other cyberpunk heroes are derived can be found in William Gibson's cyber-cowboy, Case, in Neuromancer. Cyberspace in Gibson's entire Sprawl trilogy Neuromancer, Count Zero, and Mona Lisa Overdrive is always described through the eyes of the male characters.7 Pat Cadigan, the single woman writer associated with the cyberpunk subgenre, is the only one to have created a female protagonist to quite different effect. In contrast to Gibson, Cadigan peoples her virtual world, created through conscious 'mindplay' in Synners, through the perceptions of Deadpan Allie, a woman.8 These cyberpunk heroes and heroines as conceived by Gibson and Cadigan are the reference points for the development of similar characters in their later works. With the decline of cyberpunk and its wane as a new subgenre, both have ventured out 5 David Herman, in his Introduction to Narratologies: New Perspectives on Narrative Analysis, ed. by David Herman (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1999), pp. 1-30, refers to Greimas's notion of 'actants' when stating that 'inferences about actants' are thoroughly 'grounded in behavioural paradigms' or 'sociocultural context' (p. 10). 6 Gwyneth Jones, Aliens in the Fourth Dimension', in Speaking Science Fiction: Dialogues and Interpretations, ed. by Andy Sawyer and David Seed (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2000), pp. 201-13, (p. 21). 7 William Gibson, Neuromancer (New York: Ace, 1984); Count Zm (New York: Ace, 1987); Mona Lisa Overdrive (New York: Bantam, 1989). 8 Pat Cadigan, Synners (New York: Bantam, 1991).</page><page sequence="4">132 (En)gendering Artificial Intelligence at a tangent to explore in more detail the settling of that digital frontier imagined in their respective virtual worlds. Owing to the more detailed description of these virtual worlds, they supply the ideal breeding ground for nurturing artifi cial life forms. In his so-called 'bridge' trilogy (discussed below) Gibson uses the emergence of Rei Toei, a virtual holographic creature, to connect the three volumes, each of which represents a different stage of development. Cadigan sets both her Tea from an Empty Cup and Dervish is Digital almost exclusively in virtual reality, where a woman detective, Dore Konstantin, investigates murder and fraud. But before looking more closely at the different ways in which Gibson and Cadigan create their virtual life forms, it is important to note how readers are granted access to the information necessary to configure these virtual beings. Both Gibson and Cadigan employ a third person figural narrative situation in which the voice of the narrator seems almost non-existent. This technique high lights scene over summary, showing over telling, and the virtual world over the fictional world outside it, which is always focalized through characters that are part of the story world. Gibson, on the other hand, switches perspective between different characters and thus creates intersecting narrative strands, which tend to coincide at the climax point of the story. Choosing a covert narrator enhances the overall strategy of verisimilitude and supports the pseudo-realist conventions in which the SF genre as a whole is embedded. The two main modes of 'access to consciousness' are summed up by Michael Wallace: A third-person narrator can look into a character's mind or look through it. In the first case, the narrator is the perceiver and the character's mind is perceived. In the second, the character is the perceiver and the world is perceived'.9 In the works discussed here, the narrator looks through a character, a focalizer, who perceives the emerging artificial intelligence. How the gender characteristics of both perceiver and perceived, focalizer and artificial life form interact is the basis for my comparison. 10 Gibson's Neuromancer, the cornerstone of the cyberpunk subgenre, already features the merging of two rudimentary AIs, Wintermute and Neuromancer, into a larger artificial life form. However, they can hardly be called characters and they reveal themselves only very briefly, for example, as a voice at the other end of a telephone line. 1I1 Their merging concludes Neuromancer, but their centre cannot hold and they disintegrate, to reappear in the following volume, Count 9 Wallace, p. 143. 10 Mieke Balm defines focalization as 'the relation between the vision and that which is "seen", perceived': Narratology (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1988), p. 100. 11 John Christie also observes that the narrative development of the AI is not much explored by Gibson later on: see 'Of Als and Others', in Fiction 2000: Cyberpunk and the Future of Narrative, ed. by George Slusser and Tom Shippey (Athens, GA, and London: University of Georgia Press, 1992), pp. 171-82.</page><page sequence="5">SABINE HEUSER I33 Zero, as voodoo voices in the matrix. More interesting and complex with regard to the portrayal of AIs is the final volume in the trilogy, Mona Lisa Overdrive. Its plot revolves around the hunt for the creator of mysterious boxes, which turn out to be very convincing fakes of Joseph Cornell's art. Art historians read them as a bricolage of objects invested with human pain and suffering, which is why it is all the more ironic that the resolution of the plot reveals them as having been created by a machine. This raises a number of complicated questions. Does this reduce their value as artworks or does it increase the value of the machine by elevating it to the human realm? Are the new boxes merely imitations of human artefacts? Are they perhaps only coincidental agglomerations of space junk, and the attribution of human sentiment to the clutter of objects is merely in the eye of the beholder? Has the last vestige of humanity artistic creation been usurped by the machines? Or is the creation of art by a machine a sign of its having become intelligent, more human? I believe the answers remain inconclusive. Curiously though, the act of erroneously attributing the artwork to a human being exemplifies how we transfer human characteristics on to non material entities; and I would argue that the same happens to the transfer of gender characteristics on to non-human entities. Gibson's 'bridge' trilogy comprises Virtual Light, Idoru, and All Tomorrow's Parties.12 None mentions cyberspace by name, and a version of virtual reality is now accessible via mobile technology. Virtual Light glasses provide the interface to a virtual world, a map to a territory, a master plan to be superimposed over the real city. The plot is simple enough, the two main storylines being focused around, and partly focalized by, Chevette, a female bike courier who lives on the bridge connecting San Francisco and Oakland, and Rydell, a freelance detec tive hired to find the Virtual Light glasses that Chevette stole at a party. A third focalizer, who describes and comments on the patchwork bridge structure and the emerging artificial life form, is Yamazaki, an 'existential sociologist'; he represents a more detached point of view but ultimately remains a participant observer. His observations are recorded in a notebook, as are snippets of his interviews with Skinner, one of the founding members of the bridge commu nity after the earthquake. Because he is from a foreign culture,Japan, he repre sents a plausible excuse for describing and commenting on what would be natural and obvious to Chevette and Rydell. Chevette, who lives with Skinner, represents the insider's perspective on the bridge community; Rydell represents the outsider's view. As the action unfolds, the space of the bridge, its 'secondary construction' (Virtual Light, p. 62), gradually comes to life. Its intricate, semi-autonomous 12 William Gibson, Virtual Light (New York: Bantam, 1993); Idoru (New York: Putnam, 1996); All Tomorrow's Parties (New York: Putnam, 1999).

The bridge has 'grown another reality' (p. 62). It has become an autonomous zone outside the dominant system of post-capitalist franchises and corporations, surveillance devices, and organized government; its society resembles a self-organizing organism. Rather than functioning as background, the bridge is actually the foreground, described in much more detail than the appearance, motivation, feeling, or action of any character. Characters and plot seem entirely subservient to bringing this truly postmodern habitat to life. Against this self-organizing space conceived as virtual life form, Virtual Light introduces the female hologram as an intelligent software agent for simulation environments, a personal digital assistant that, when projected as a hologram, can interact with people. It increasingly becomes more independent and intel ligent, but the process is a long and arduous journey, which weaves through the trilogy as a theme. The reader encounters the hologram for the first time without realizing what this strange apparition is about to become. It is prefigured by Rydell's semi-mystical experience in Hollywood before he is fired as a cop: Sometimes you saw things up there and couldn't quite be sure you'd seen them or not. One full-moon night Rydell had slung Gunhead around a curve and frozen a naked woman in the head-lights, the way a deer'll stop, trembling, on a country road. Just a second she was there, long enough for Rydell to think he'd seen that she either wore silver horns or some kind of hat with an upturned crescent, and that she might've been Japanese, which struck him right then as the weirdest thing about any of it. Then she saw him he saw her see him and smiled. Then she was gone. (p. 23) The full moon sets the scene for a magical appearance, the extraordinary nature of which is heightened by Rydell's sensory confusion, and then reinforced by his subsequent explanation of how he thinks the mystery deer-woman disap peared. In fact, two contradictory memories are given as explanation. He remembers her as disappearing both up and down the hillside until she is 'flat out impossible gone' (p. 24). The reader is steered by Rydell's perceptions, which are described after the event and riddled with his attempts to rationalize this peculiar experience. He wonders whether 'Japanese women ever have that kind of long curly hair' (p. 24), thus revealing certain gender as well as ethnic stereo types, and he remarks that 'he'd seen other things, too', and that despite not knowing 'what she was [ ...] he didn't even care if she'd been human or not' (p. 24). The choice of 'thing' and 'what' turn her into an object, grammatically non-human, as does the comparison with a terrified deer. Furthermore, the active voice of the verb 'frozen' makes Rydell the agent and the woman-thing the passive victim-object. The focalizer, Rydell, perceives her feminine naked body as a pretty, long-legged object. As if to underline the representation of the woman as a sexual object, her pubic hair is also shaved in the shape of an excla</page><page sequence="7">SABINE HEUSER I35 mation mark. Rydell, on the other hand, is protected by a hard metal shell, the police car named Gunhead. At first sight the scene does not seem significant at all, but it assumes more meaning when it is evoked again later in the novel. On the bridge Rydell recog nizes the hologram-woman in a bar, which is ironically named 'Cognitive Dissi dents': he 'saw thatJapanese woman, the one he'd seen that time up in the hills over Hollywood [ ...]. She was standing up on a little stage, naked, her long curly hair falling around to her waist' (p. I85). His first reaction is to shake himself, because he thinks he is dreaming. Then he reminds himself that she is a hologram that is remote-controlled by a fat woman in a wheelchair, 'her hair the colour and texture of coarse steel wool' (p. i85). In terms of appearance, she could hardly be more different from the sexy hologram. The hologram is referred to as 'Josie's dancer', Josie being the woman in the wheelchair who controls its movements. At this stage the hologram-woman is grammatically and literally in her possession. Although referred to as having the appearance of a woman, in Rydell's mind the hologram is still a neuter grammatical pronoun, an 'it', a 'thing' without a proper name: 'It was her. It was' (p. i86). It is an im material projection of light that is dependent on the material projection unit to bring her to life. But there is a crucial moment in the story where she starts acting independently, thus distracting the Russian killer cop in pursuit of Chevette and giving Rydell time to save them both. Again, the actual experience is too over whelming to be described as first-hand experience; Rydell can rationalize it only in retrospect when telling his friend about the incident: And this ball of light had shot down, expanding, from a point on the wall. [...] It was the color of the hologram's skin, kind of honey and ivory, all marbled through with the dark of her hair and eyes, like a fast-forward of a satellite storm-system. [.. .] And as it spun, her eyes and mouth, open in some silent scream, blinked by, all magnified. Each eye, for a fraction of a second, the size of the ball itself, and the white teeth big, too, each one long as a man's hand. (p. I90) The hologram-woman appears fragmented, reduced to her individual body parts, her perfect honey and ivory skin. A surreal effect, which resembles a commercial for women's beauty products. In becoming a weapon, her frag mented facial features assume an absurd and monstrous dimension, especially when compared to a man's hand. As powerful warrior, she is still an object in the form of a ball, but she is no longer 'natural'; in fact, she is compared to a storm-system, an uncontrollable natural element. Virtual Light concludes with the hologram not yet fully individuated, as it is just beginning to develop some active agency. In the second volume, Idoru, it emerges as an individual and begins to resemble a person. 'It' is now frequently referred to as a 'she', especially once it has been named. Rei Toei is an idoru, Japanese for 'idol', a virtual pop star with an immaterial, phantom</page><page sequence="8">136 (En)gendering Artficial Intelligence appearance, just as the Greek etymology of the word suggests. One could even read her as a symbol representing the false, commercial semi-gods of the pop-music industry. Yamazaki explains in his commentator role: 'She is Rei Toei. She is a personality-construct, a congeries of software agents, the creation of information-designers. She is akin to what I believe they call a "synthespian", in Hollywood' (Idoru, p. 92). In fact, there is a rumour that Rez, a famous rock star in the band Lo/Rez, wants to marry Rei Toei. But an interspecies marriage is inconceivable. How can a human marry a non-human? How could that marriage be consummated? Yet the rock star and the idoru are more alike than might first appear. Both are pop stars and exist in a media-saturated universe, a veritable 'ecology of celebrity' (p. 2). This notion of celebrity as having a life of its own, despite all attempts at spin control, is the facilitating metaphor for the emergence of Rei Toei as an artificial intelligence. She is so famous that, with some help, she achieves escape velocity and becomes a person rather than a cardboard cut-out. The idoru in this volume is focalized through Colin Laney, who spends most of his time immersed in the net looking for significant patterns of information. Towards the end, she is also portrayed by Chia, a teenager, sent toJapan by her Seattle Lo/Rez fan club in order to find out whether the rumours of Rez wanting to marry the idoru are actually true and to verify 'whether she exists or not' (p. I2). Laney has a unique gift to perceive the 'nodal points' in the vast sea of data (p. 25), to identify the 'signature' an individual leaves behind in the net through his or her transactions. He merely uses his intuition, honed by a medical condition that makes him hyper-perceptive to identify the nodal point, 'an infor mational peculiarity opening into some unthinkably deeper structure' (p. 40). Thus he identifies Alison Shires's suicidal tendency in the 'pool of data that reflected her life, its surface made of all the bits that were the daily record of her life as it registered on the digital fabric of the world' (p. 4I). Laney's skill has nothing to do with intelligence or analytical power, his 'moves made no logical sense' (p. 38). He cannot prevent Alison Shires from committing suicide; in fact one of the inherent dangers of his mission is to fall victim to 'serious transfer ence, the point at which the researcher's intimacy with the subject could lead to loss of perspective' (p. 52). Laney fails to save her in time, and later, when he checks on her configuration of data, he observes that 'her data was very still' (p. i i6). Thus he realizes that the absence of new information signifies death in cyberspace. Laney's next assignment is to investigate Rez and his obsession with the idoru. However, he has difficulty identifying any unique pattern in all the spin controlled media images surrounding both Rez and the idoru. Rez is close to 'invisible' to Laney because he leaves no trace in his personal name, not even credit-card transactions. And Laney's attempt to meet Rez and Rei Toei in</page><page sequence="9">SABINE HEUSER I37 person at a club is not entirely successful. Laney can barely endure looking at the idoru. He informs us of how he anticipated her appearance as some 'indus trial-strength synthesis of Japan's last three dozen top female media faces' (P. I75). But once he meets her eyes, he 'seemed to cross a line. In the very struc ture of her face, in geometries of underlying bone, lay coded histories of dynastic flight, privation, terrible migrations' (p. I75). Although he understands that 'she is not flesh, she is information' (p. I78), the density of information is too much for his strictly human processing capacity: 'She induced the nodal vision in some unprecedented way; she induced it as narrative' (p. I78). Thus by looking at her face, he has the impression of falling 'through her eyes', much as in Alice through the Looking-Glass. Rei Toei's videos represent her very 'dreams' (p. 237), her personal memories, and not just disconnected, discrete fragments or images. In contrast to Rez, they are not secondary representations but her first-hand experience, her life. Apparently, Laney has met a 'new version of the idoru', a 'high-bandwidth prototype' (p. I90). Her phenomenon is explained by Rez as existing in a 'realm of ongoing serial creation [... ] Entirely process; infinitely more than the combined sum of her various selves. [. ...] she grows denser and more complex' (p. 202). Again, this is a concept that has been created by a seemingly trivial and unimportant analogy some fifty pages earlier. The comparison is between Lo's career as a Lo/Rez musician and an encounter with a soup vendor in Hong Kong. The unique feature of the soup is that it never runs out, fresh ingredients being continually added to the old stock; it is thus always different yet also the same (p. I49). In similar fashion, the union between Rez and the idoru is prepared rhetorically and semantically. Only when the documentary footage is combined with the vast knowledge base of all the messages ever produced by all the Lo/Rez fan clubs does Laney have sufficient information to identify the 'nodal point' that is the idoru. In the process he even briefly loses control of his point of view and is directed by the idoru. He seems trapped in a room with her and is presented with a vision of the imminent 'alchemical marriage' of the human and the non-human to be transmuted into one (p. 229). This represents an inter esting role reversal: Laney is no longer in control but forced into the role of a passive observer, even if only for a little while. Furthermore, the idoru seems to be occupying a room borrowed from one of his memories, and she is now also speaking for herself: 'I found it' (p. 227). The genie is out of the bottle; the idoru now seems to be able to occupy any virtual scenario she chooses, even the private Virtual Venice that Chia keeps on her computer. When the idoru appears in these scenarios, she has the uncanny ability to adopt the physical attributes of the virtual characters she chooses to replace. The mimicry serves less as camouflage than as an attempt to try on or to imitate human appearance. She is oblivious to gender-related fashion conventions. In contrast to that, when Chia notices</page><page sequence="10">138 (En)gendering Artificial Intelligence that 'the idoru had the Music Master's haircut', she concludes that it 'made her look like a girl pretending to be a boy' (p. 232). It is Laney who realizes that Al has nothing to do with preprogrammed algo rithms or simulated human behaviour: 'If there were going to be genuine Al, the argument ran, it was most likely to evolve in ways that had least to do with pretending to be human. [... .] Al might be created accidentally, and that people might not initially recognize it for what it was' (pp. 247-48). While Zona, Chia's friend from the Lo/Rez fan club, still refers to the idoru as a thing, 'you aren't real! You're a made-up thing' (p. 232), the idoru explains that her alchemical union with Rez, the transformation of two lesser media-created beings into a precious new life form, has already begun and they have started 'growing together' (p. 237). All Tomorrow's Parties, the final volume, shifts the focus back fromJapan to the bridge linking San Francisco and Oakland. Laney's illness, which made him so hyperaware of the nodal points, has progressed. He now lives in a cardboard box, which he leaves only when putting on his Virtual Light glasses. Again, it is Yamazaki's function to provide the reader with information about what happened in between the two volumes of the trilogy. Following the failure of Rez and Rei Toei's marriage and the latter's disappearance, Yamazaki appears to be employed by the idoru. As it turns out, Rei Toei's 'program' is contained in a flask that is also a portable holographic projector. It is in this container that Rydell receives her as a parcel for safe keeping. When Rydell lets Rei Toei out of the box for the first time, he is in a tiny room at a bed and breakfast on the bridge. He perceives her as resembling a fairy-tale creature, a veritable Tinkerbell: 'Something flickered. Neon butterfly. Torn wings. And then this girl was there, kneeling right up close, and he felt his heart roll over, catch itself The how of her not being there, then being there', intrigues him (All Tomorrow's Parties, p. I52). Her appearing naked at first and then copying whatever outfit she sees in the person in front of her comes as no surprise; she seems to have no real sense of self yet. However, she delights in repeating 'I am Rei Toei', the grammar of which stands out from the streetwise idiom of the other characters as much as her literally luminous appearance. 'This is a hologram [. . .] but I am real', she proceeds to point out (p. 153), as if distinguishing her ephemeral manifestation from the essence of her soul, which is stored in the projector unit. She demonstrates some self-awareness and converses quite intelligently with Rydell. She tells her story and gives an account of her recent history. We also learn that Laney was the one to take her off the virtualJapanese island where she moved with Rez after their wedding. Lydell appears to have been the first one to realize fully that she is 'an emergent system, a self continually being iterated from experiential input' (p. I63). Therefore, he brought her off the island so that she could expand her horizon. Her continual</page><page sequence="11">SABINE HEUSER I39 evolution is once more summarized by an analogy: 'Rei Toei was that river into which one can never step twice. As she became more herself, through the inputting of experience, through human interaction, she grew and changed' (p. I93). Ironically, Rez, her human partner, cannot adapt; he is too static and ultimately too boring for her. It is almost as if the Al outgrew him. The technique of focalizing the Al, usually through the eyes of the male characters, is a very cinematic device, which comes full circle when Tessa, one of Chevette's former room-mates, accompanies her to make a documentary about life on the bridge. For the project Tessa brings along her camera, referred to as 'disembodied eye' (p. 34) or 'God's Little Toy' (p. 65). It records events while floating through a room, even when Tessa has gone missing. But its technologi cal, detached perspective is accorded little importance in terms of advancing the plot. Yet it brings home the metaphoric quality inherent in the very notion of 'focalizer' and its distinct bias towards visual information. The fact that through out the trilogy the idoru is predominantly perceived through male eyes might also explain a certain voyeuristic fascination with her. Although there is some progression from her being perceived as a shell-shocked deer on the road to her being described as a more active life form, she remains a much-coveted commodity, either as pop idol or as emerging artificial intelligence. That she ultimately manages to escape the confines of her projector-unit flask is as much a miracle as the miraculous emergence of her intelligence in the first place. The last we see of her is through the eyes of Boomzilla, a marginal character who watches her jump into a new holographic Xerox machine. The experiment succeeds and she is copied and transmitted to all the New Dragon franchises participating in the experiment. The television screens show her running away in a number of different cities, naked, of course. Whereas Gibson treats most gender characteristics in a cliched fashion, Pat Cadigan in both Tea from an Empt Cup and Dervish is Digital disrupts any easy gender identification.'3 Even the names of the characters would not be easily classifiable into male and female if it were not for the use of personal pronouns. Dore Konstantin, who investigates crimes committed in a computer-generated virtual world called AR or artificial reality, is mostly referred to by her last name, which actually suggests a male first name. The first volume is a whodunnit about a murder committed in AR, and the second an investigation of criminal fraud. Strictly speaking, murder in AR was always thought impossible because AR is strictly make-believe. But something must have gone wrong, because veteran role players are being killed and something or someone is piling up the bodies. 13 Pat Cadigan, Tea From an Empty Cup (London: Harper Collins, 1998), and Dervish is Digital (New York: Tor, 2000). (All page references given in the text are to these editions.)</page><page sequence="12">140 (En)gendering Artificial Intelligence Cadigan's AR is conceived as containing many different scenarios or worlds. These resemble role-playing games and include settings like post-Apocalyptic Noo Yawk Sitty or pre-millennial Hong Kong. A recording of a victim's online session allows detective Konstantin to replay the events leading up to the murder. As in Gibson's works, perspective functions literally like a movie camera, and the only perspective available is that of a detached observer. However, Konstan tin cannot identify the killer, so she decides to slip on the dead kid's virtual reality hotsuit, to go undercover, and to interview potential witnesses. Her storyline alternates with Yuki's, who conducts a private investigation into Tom's disap pearance. It takes the reader a while to figure out that Konstantin and Yuki are probably looking for the same person, because, as it turns out, Tom played many parts and took on many different names. The hotsuit is an interface for entering AR and comes with a fully program mable representation of an online persona. When Konstantin puts on the hotsuit recovered from the murder scene, she appears as Shantih Love, who has an 'androgynous face that suggested the best of India and Japan in combina tion' (Tea from an Empt Cup, p. 34). Her sex is indeterminable from these features; it is labelled as 'Any; all; why do you care?' (p. 35; italics in original). Another peculiarity surrounding the ominous death of the kid who used the hotsuit is that he died at the very beginning of his online session, but the Shantih Love persona continued to act in the scenario for another four hours. The question is whether the hotsuit was abducted by 'a robot or a very human hijacker?' (p. 39). Yuki, the victim's girlfriend, who is not aware that the person she knows as Tom is dead, gets herself hired as a personal assistant tojoy Flower, for whom Tom worked. When she puts on the hotsuit in her office to enter AR, she takes on Tom's appearance. But she only displays his appearance; it does not mean that she behaves or talks like Tom or that she knows how to use the icons stored in his directory. By introducing the possibility of gender and body switching and by fore grounding the notion of role play, Cadigan opens up some interesting lines of investigation into character and gender in fiction. Identity or character is tied to an identifying proper name or a pronoun, but that often proves a bottomless pit rather than a stable reference in her story universe. The first chapter, in which no one is referred to by name but only as 'the white guy' or 'the Japanese guy', sets the scene for Teafrom an Empt Cup, but it can only be made sense of later on in the novel. In retrospect, we know that the opening scene refers to the sale of the murder victim's hotsuit. The reason why it is such a valuable commodity, however, is revealed only much later. A Japanese appearance, together with some genetic passkey, is the way into an elitist Japanese ethnic enclave, post Apocalyptic Tokyo, to replace the realJapan that vanished in an earthquake. As part of the bartering for the hotsuit, the Japanese character mentions that he is</page><page sequence="13">SABINE HEUSER 141 married, but also points out that it is 'nothing serious. It's not like I told her my real name or anything' (p. 5). Konstantin first comes across the dead kid's name as 'Shantih Love' because it is the person attached to the hotsuit that she decides to wear, whereas Yuki, his girlfriend, knows him simply as Tom. Only the reader can piece together all the bits of the puzzle, but that is associated with some interpretative effort and requires careful reading. Tom is short for Tomoyuki Iguchi, but, as it turns out, that is not his real name either. His wife mentions that he kept changing his name once a week. In this world names are not tokens of a stable identity but they are no less real. They are merely indicators of the many roles that people can play, the many personas that people can assume in AR: 'Online names are real names. Online' (p. 84). Once in AR, one's appear ance can be composed from scratch. The representations people choose for themselves have only an arbitrary, if any, connection to their real lives. In fact the character and appearance of their AR persona is often diametrically opposed to their real character. Some of these possibilities are introduced when Konstantin uncovers the background story of the other seven murder victims. The first victim, a woman in her thirties, had chosen a dragon as her online persona; the second victim, a man, had chosen a hybrid persona, part Marilyn Monroe, part Elvis Presley; the third victim had described himself as an AR junkie, who thought that 'realtime was the disposable reality because it could not be preserved or replayed in AR [ . .1. In AR, everyone is immortal (p. 65; italics in original); the fourth victim had been paralyzed and used AR as a form of therapy. For most of these victims AR represented a more important part of their lives than their actual life. As Konstantin observes, 'Sally Lefkow's dragon would be more missed and mourned than Sally herself' (p. 67). The separation of mind and body is further thematized when Yuki sees her reflection in a mirror in AR. She actually looks like Tom in the mirror, and her reflection suddenly takes on a life of its own and starts talking to her. Instead of selling his shadow to the devil like Peter Schlemihl in Chamisso's tale, Tom sold his body to someone seeking entry to the new virtualJapan. and he is now trying to eke out an existence in the shadows.'4 But the only way for him to exist with neither a body nor a bank account to pay for his online time is by hijacking or 'piggy-backing' other characters, in this case his former online persona. Yuki is scared by this seemingly impossible event; after all, she was trying to get Tom 'out of her system' because he had disappeared without giving her a reason (P. 47). When she senses that her body movement is no longer under her control, she is not only wearing Tom's face, but she also feels like someone else is wearing her body: 'It felt as if someone was wearing her hand as a glove' (p. II7). When 14 Adelbert von Chamisso's 1814 tale Peter Schlemihls wundersame Geschichte (English titles include Peter Schlemihl and The Shadowless Man) describes how a man sells his shadow and therefore his soul to the Devil.</page><page sequence="14">142 (En)gendering Artificial Intelligence she looks at her hand, she notices that 'there was something else under the white glove besides her virtual body. It was trying to hide its presence by keeping perfectly still, but now that she knew it was there, she couldn't not feel it' (p. I I7). The loss of control over her own body is even more frightening, because its cause is utterly unknown and the obscure agent is referred to as an unidentified 'it' or non-human thing. Privacy, meaning the covering up of one's identity or origin code, is expen sive. Yet in the end the police seem to uncover the true identities of most personas. It is the 'source code' that Body Sativa or the Dread Female of Heaven refers to towards the end of the novel: 'All peoples have a source, [. . .] we are reconstructing ours, not in soil and rock and ocean, but in flesh and blood, nerve and synapse' (p. i87). Body Sativa seems to be an exclusively artificial being, a database, a mythic figure who sometimes takes on the appearance of Yuki's grandmother but who ultimately ties into theJapanese origin myth that is hinted at in the opening pages of the novel. It seems that Body Sativa is the mysteri ous persona upon which all the story lines converge. The fact that Yuki is asked whether she knows the 'art of filling an empty cup with tea when you have no tea' (p. i88) also alludes to the power of the imagination to flesh out fictional creatures, to give life to a name: 'It was just the power of suggestion that made them think that they were somehow all together, seeing the same thing. Or at least it made them give things the same names' (p. I95). Yuki's ghost in the machine, the puppet master pulling her strings, is also experienced by Konstan tin when she is in the process of tracking down the murderer: 'there was the terrible, new feeling, the sensation of having been invaded, penetrated and permeated by some force that intended to use you, from the inside out' (p. 203). While her body is beyond her conscious control, Konstantin is made to experi ence Tom's death from his point of view. In the process she realizes that he appears to have cut his own throat but that his limbs cannot have been under his conscious control. She presumes that he was steered by someone other than himself Konstantin tries to explain this rationally and scientifically as a confla tion of AR enhanced by drugs, whereas Yuki offers a mythic explanation of the events. She observes herself performing a dance, of being steered by puppeteers in the old Japanese bunraku tradition: 'In this bunraku, the puppet was not supposed to remain conscious of the puppeteers, but enter a state in which its life was the combination of the puppeteers' movements and the audience willing to let it be alive in their eyes' (p. 206). The prime mover is no longer a criminal person but the Dread Female of Heaven from the origin myth. Yuki and Konstantin join forces in a mystical, hallucinatory puppet theatre and summon Tom. Konstantin arrests him for the serial murder and Yuki seems to enter the digital nirvana of OldJapan while still in Tom's body. Because there are so many role reversals and because reality, artificial reality, and creation myth are all</page><page sequence="15">SABINE HEUSER I43 experienced as equally real in the make-believe world of AR, the plot is ulti mately so convoluted that it is irresolvable, meaning that the true identity of the killer is never fully revealed. A very frustrating experience for a reader initially baited to follow a whodunnit. Because the real, original body always remains elusive, the reader is lost in an infinite reflection and fails to identify the original among the abundant copies. Dervish is Digital also features Dore [sic] Konstantin as the investigating officer in different AR scenarios. The rules are the same as in Teafrom an Empty Cup, and again Konstantin operates undercover; this time her goal is to track down the elusive Hastings Dervish, who is haunting the virtual fashion workshop of Susannah Ell, a fashion designer of both real and virtual clothes, and also his former wife and business partner. The name 'Dervish' is emblem atic of his character. Although he is no ascetic monk, his practices are no less fantastic. He certainly dazzles people with his digital acrobatics and dizzying appearances. A detective's job involves looking for the truth, but that honest endeavour becomes ultimately impossible because 'there's no truth in AR' (Dervish is Digital, p. 26). Even perceptions are 'always warped under the influ ence of AR' (P. 28). And there is nothing 'what lawyers liked to call a legiti mate contract' (p. 35); it is only a contract between people, a 'consensual reality' (P. 3I). The reader is introduced to Dervish by Susannah when she gives her report to Konstantin and her assistant Celestine. At first the police officers do not believe her when she claims that 'he's left a stain or a smell behind' (p. 58) that she cannot remove. Even when she explains that 'Dervish is in the infrastruc ture, he can be anywhere any time he wants' (p. 59), they think she is imagining things. Susannah believes Dervish is stalking her, after having switched his body with an artificial intelligence. He seems to have found the 'out door' into a purely virtual existence independent of a material body an erroneous belief, it seems, because Konstantin reports towards the end of the novel that his dead body was found in an expensive gated community somewhere in Florida. As it turns out, Dervish is neither immortal nor entirely digital, although his former wife regards him as a 'self-initializing program with consciousness and intent' (p. 62). Since he can manifest himself in any form he chooses, another interest ing question emerges, namely, how someone in AR, or the reader for that matter, can know for sure if he or she is actually confronted with Dervish. It would seem that there is very little semantic continuity for the reader to be able to construe a coherent identity from his multiple, more or less random appearances. He changes names, age, appearance, gender; he appears as a child or as an adult. He can even hide in the pixels of Susannah's digital workshop and lead a truly fractal existence. In a way, he can be recognized only by his behavioural quirks, his mannerisms, his patterns of speech. That is why his wife can identify him</page><page sequence="16">144 (En)gendering Art/ifcial Intelligence quite easily 'just from certain clues perceptible to anyone familiar enough with his habits' (p. 6i). Calling Dervish's name while in a casino in the low-down Hong Kong scenario activates a program that makes the surroundings look off colour and out of sync while simultaneously demoting all the characters in the same room on to a lower level with less speed and resolution. As a result, Konstantin can no longer see the icon she has to activate in order to exit this virtual scenario. But aJapanese detective, whom she dislikes intensely for the pornographic connotations of his choosing to present himself as a child, shows her the way out. However, since the Dervish character or program is known to hide in any digital scenario, it is also possible to question the true identity of the detective there is always the lingering doubt that he too might be possessed by Hastings Dervish. There is no way to be sure, and it is difficult to arrive at a definitive reading of the text. Konstantin's first effort to lure Dervish out of hiding in low-down Hong Kong fails miserably. She is instantly recognized because she enters 'bare faced', without a mask or disguise. For her second attempt she buys a 'custom-made persona impervious to any identifier software of any type' (p. I22). The program analyzes her behavioural tics and encodes them in such a way that they are no longer recognizable. On top of all that, she assumes the persona of a 12 year-old girl assassin in the hope that this will provide the perfect cover because she is known to find such a disguise objectionable. She feels 'like a pervert, and occasionally a parasite as well' (p. I28); then the experience is likened to an 'out of-body experience reinvented by technology' (p. 142). As a result of the disguise her perception also changes and she begins to notice how small things feel; she even perceives distances differently. Despite all these efforts Dervish spots her elaborate disguise and finds a way to unmask her. He even succeeds in 'jamming' her program, which suspends her sense of time and freezes all record of 'billable time'. Although this may look like defeat at first, it ultimately represents an offence for which he can be sued, a crime that can be traced back to him. It is the potential loss of income from unbilled online time that makes this a high profile case and provides the detective with material evidence on the grounds of which the perpetrator can be convicted. Up to this point Dervish is an elusive digital character who can hide in the data. Despite all make-believe or kayfabe a wrestling metaphor used several times in the novel - the human body cannot entirely be erased; it always leaves a trace. Konstantin's worst crisis is the moment when Dervish intrudes into her software interface and her perception fails: 'she could see nothing' and 'she couldn't feel her body at all' (p. I4I). In contrast to Dervish and other male char acters in Cadigan's previous books, the female characters such as Konstantin never show any desire to get rid of their material existence. For them, virtual reality is a means to an end but not an end in itself</page><page sequence="17">SABINE HEUSER 145 AMs as fictional characters are created no differently from all the other persons peopling these fictional worlds. However, as Cadigan's versions show in partic ular, they highlight the fact that any reference to a 'real' referent is merely a convention and, in the end, a realistic, mimetic illusion. While cyberpunk in the I980s was more concerned with the merging of humans and computers into artificial life forms, the later works discussed here highlight the empowering as well as the criminal potential of these ultimately fantastic constructs. The emer gence of AMs is a theme that also helps foreground the cognitive processes involved in the construction of fictional characters. Interestingly enough, neither in Gibson's nor in Cadigan's works discussed here are AMs the focalizers, the perceivers describing the events; they are always at the receiving end, the objects of the perceiving human subjects. In Gibson's 'bridge' trilogy they demonstrate intelligent behaviour when they begin to think for and about themselves, to make decisions, to reflect about their status in the world. But are these not all thoroughly human criteria for defining intelligence in our own image? Cadigan's artificial life forms remain much more elusive and ultimately pose more chal lenging questions with regard to the virtual and the real, the original and the copy.</page></plain_text>
