HASKOVEC Abstract Following some difficulties identifying the * Large Naturalistic Figures' style paintings of Chaloupka's (1979) chronological model, I travelled to Mt. Gilruth-Djarwanmbi to the two original sites of Chaloupka's chronological model of Arnhem Land plateau rock art, to reassess the definition of Chaloupka's Large Naturalistic style. At neither of the two 'key sites of the sequence* (Chaloupka 1977) could I find the later 'Dynamic Figures' style overlaying the Large Naturalistic style, despite Chaloupka's assertion. A review of Chaloupka's published and unpublished reports suggests that no such evidence exists. My own research at other sites and other data shows that Chaloupka's outline of the chronological sequence is not supported by the evidence at the two sites. I have re-interpreted the sequence and outlined a hypothetical rock art sequence. In this paper I will be discussing some art styles from Western Arnhem Land and their relative and absolute age. Although I realise that 'art styles' may be a contentious issue in Australian archaeology, I ask the reader to bear with me. To discuss previous findings and their validity, I have to use the terminology and categories of those documents. Also I believe that the art styles of Western Arnhem Land are indeed valid cognitive categories and that different styles were used at different times or places. (See also Conkey and Hastorf 1990.) Throughout this paper I will refer to Large Naturalistic, Dynamic, and Yam styles rather than the unwieldy Large Naturalistic Figures style, etc. The subjects, styles and chronology of Western Arnhem Land rock art are extremely complex. A number of people have tried to sort the paintings into cognitive categories based on colour (Gunn 1987), subjects (Tacon 1987, Haskovec and Sullivan 1988), styles (Chaloupka 1977, Brandi 1982, Haskovec and Sullivan 1988), geographic distribution (Haskovec 1988), technology (Brandi 1982, Lewis 1988) and chronology (all the above). So far, the most articulate expression of a perceived order in the Arnhem Land rock art has been Chaloupka's (1977, 1979, 1983, 1984, 1985); his chronology and stylistic categories have been accepted as the most authoritative interpretation of the subject. Chaloupka's chronological table in modified form is being used by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service to record and interpret the rock art for visitors to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service.

Consequently, Chaloupka's proposed chronological model is gaining uncritical public acceptance. Some researchers such as Tacon (1987) have tried to show that the chronology and particularly the definition of some styles, such as X-ray styles, are imprecise. Lewis's (1988) review of Chaloupka's absolute chronology has largely been accepted as more realistic. Haskovec (1988) demonstrated the existence of other styles in the region. However, no one has seriously challenged the validity of Chaloupka's sequence of relative rock art styles. This is not surprising, since work of such scope would require a number of years of field work, gathering data under very difficult conditions. To review Chaloupka's model one must be able to visit the sites and discuss the findings made by previous researchers, as well as discuss his relative chronological model. Chaloupka offers very little evidence to support the rock art sequence (Chaloupka 1977, 1983, 1985). Since first publishing this sequence in 1977, Chaloupka (1979, 1983, 1984 and 1985) has changed the original description very little. Even in an overview of the evidence for the relative chronological sequence it is clear that the author offers too little data in support of his model, particularly in regard to the definition of the styles and their superimposition (1977, 1983). The styles are ill-defined (Tacon 1987). As such the model appears to be a series of assertions rather then a presentation of evidence and a discussion of the findings. The superimposition sequence is described without supporting photographic evidence or any discussion. The absolute age of the art styles has been overestimated (Lewis 1988, Haskovec 1989). Nevertheless, the fact that Chaloupka did not offer conclusive proof of his model does not mean that the model itself is not valid. Difficulties with the identification and definitions of Chaloupka's styles, and their relative chronology (Large Naturalistic style in particular), have encouraged me to articulate these difficulties and try to resolve them in terms of his model. Chaloupka (1984:13) writes of 32 'clear super- impositions' of Dynamic figures over Large Naturalistic figures (no location, description or photo offered). Brandi (1982: 126) also mentions the possibility of a style preceding the Dynamic style. Chaloupka's published and unpublished reports indicate that the chronological sequence originated at Mt. Gilruth-Djarwanmbi (Chaloupka 1977:243-54).

Chaloupka and after receiving a Northern Land Council permit, I flew to Mt. Gilruth in the company of two Aboriginal men to study the two art sites in question. I hoped that by studying the two sites (registered as 537 IP 0001 and 5371P 0002) I would be able to repeat Chaloupka's findings and to clarify the issues. However, as I was unable to to confirm the model at the two sites, I had to widen the study area to include other sites within about 50 km radius of Mt Gilruth. The sites referred to are identified here for obvious reasons only by their ANPWS registration numbers as 5471P 0341, 5471P 0177, 5471P 0128, 5471P 0633, 5471P 1128 and 5471P 1124. Description of the Large Naturalistic style Under his Large Naturalistic style, Chaloupka includes Large Naturalistic figures, Stick figures, and red-outline- and-wash figures (see Figures 1, 2 and 3). Chaloupka (1977:246-7) writes: The styles of the large naturalistic animal and anthropomorphic designs can be categorised as: i those in red lines; ii those in red lines and a wash; iii those as in (ii), but with parts of the design emphasised by a darker wash; iv those with the design painted as a flat wash; and ν any of those above, but outlined in white as well. To define an art style as 'those in red lines' may appear quite inadequate, however in terms of the two Mt. Gilruth sites only, it is possible to identify which paintings are included in the definition. Also, Chaloupka includes a reproduction of the Mt. Gilruth art identified as Large Naturalistic style. Chaloupka also describes Large Naturalistic style (1977: 248): These oldest representations are executed as line paintings, in which the whole of the figure is filled with lines which follow the outline of the body, its appendages and contours. Some designs were filled in with a transparent wash, others had a darker wash emphasising particular parts of the body [ 1 977 Figure 2c] . Most of these designs were executed in a variety of shades of red, with one shade predominating. Two of the designs have been outlined in white as well, and in one of them two shades of red have been used. In the same article, the Large Naturalistic style is said to include Stick figures also, which are overlaying a Female Anthropomorph. Other paintings are included in this style (1977:249): The many kangaroo and crocodile figures of this style are associated with schematised human figures and their weapons. Sometimes the spears have already been thrown, and are lodged in the animal's body (fig. 2a, b, c). The spears are of two multibarbed types, single and three-pronged, and some of the schematised hunters seem to be holding spearthrowers (fig. 2b). Chaloupka writes (1983:8) that human figures of the Large Naturalistic style are in two forms. This time the 62</page><page sequence="3">'spearthrowers' in the same painting are identified as fighting picks. In one schema the figures are large, portrayed fronlally or in a twisted perspective. Noticeable attention was given to heads shown in profile with recognisable features, and also to hands and feet. The figures were drawn in detailed outline and filled in with ochre wash. In the other schema, the human male appears as a small, one-line thick stick figure in the act of spearing a large, naturalistic animal. The weapons used by the ambiguous stick figures consist of two spear types - the simple multibarbed and a three pronged multibarbed spear and perhaps also the fighting pick. This is repeated to the letter in 1984:24. As a brief aside, it is difficult to distinguish thus between a spearthrower and a fighting pick (see also Lewis 1988). In a hunting scene, where men are in the 'act of spearing a large, naturalistic animal', it seems odd that they should be holding in their throwing hand a fighting pick rather then a spearthrower, particularly since a fighting pick seems to be a personal combat weapon. In 1985:274 Chaloupka slightly modified wording of the above, but did not change his view. 'In one [form] the figures Plate 1. Ceiling of Chaloupka's Mt.

Gilruth and the chronological position of Large Naturalistic style First, a few words are in order on the superimposition of paintings as evidence for chronological sequence. A number of writers have attempted to define when a superimposition of paintings can be accepted as evidence. However, it is often difficult to see a superimposition in the first place, and it is extremely difficult to find a site where visual inspection of a superimposition proves a point beyond dispute. Usually only miniscule samples of paintings, where the evidence of a superimposition is immediately dear, can be accepted. Unfortunately photography and micro-photography, both two-dimensional and therefore compacting forms of representation, are unable always to convey super- impositions due to deceptive differences in the paintings' hues. Perhaps in most cases a photograph is best used to present the site and the painting as a demonstration that the real data exist. In an attempt to establish a chronological sequence of paintings, a number of related factors can be investigated for 64</page><page sequence="5">supportive evidence. First, there is the distribution of paintings in the region, where physical proximity of painting styles suggests proximity of the styles within time (i.e. similarity of habitation, of exploitation pattern, history of occupation, etc.). Second, there is the similarity of technology portrayed, which also suggests proximity of styles within time. Technology portrayed within the individual styles also groups the styles into a broad relative chronological model (see Lewis 1988). Third, there are the resources portrayed within the style; the availability of resources according to geomorphological history can suggest an absolute date. Fourth, the similarity of economic activities portrayed in styles also points to their relative chronological position. Chaloupka's chronological table of the Western Arnhem Land art styles starts at about 30,000 years BP with Object imprints, which are followed by Large Naturalistic style paintings. Sometime after 20,000 years BP, these are replaced by Dynamic style paintings, which are followed by Post Dynamic style, Simple figures with boomerangs style and Yam style. Although Chaloupka (1977, 1979 and elsewhere) indicates that the 'Large Naturalistic-Dynamic -Yam' chronological sequence is derived from Mt. Gilruth, in the report on the two sites studied at Mt. Gilruth (1979:2) the only indication of any chronological order by superimposition is in one sentence. 'Next to this is the group of paintings, [a] number of superimposed layers of paintings, the key to the cultural sequence of styles (1979: Plates 48-54)/ The plates showing this superimposition are titled: 48. Main part of ceiling at Wanmbi 49. Kapirigi viewing the well protected ceiling 50. Cross-section of shelter at the main ceiling 51. Main ceiling with a number of superimpositions 52. Detail of the previous plate showing the superimposed dynamic figures [emphasis mine] 53. Thylacine, the Tasmanian tiger and other figures in dynamic style 54. 'Yam' design and other figures. In the paragraph that follows, Chaloupka describes 'involved "yam figure" superimposed over earlier dynamic figures.' As there is no written reference to an overlay or super- imposition for Large Naturalistic figures, we have to turn to the photograph of the 'key to the cultural sequence of styles' for further examination, i.e. Plates 51 and 52 (here Plate 1). However, at this 'key site of the chronological sequence' there is no complete superimposition sequence over Large Naturalistic style paintings. There are Dynamic figures, which are overlaid by paintings of (most likely Yam style) large macropods and also by Yam figures (my observations and Chaloupka's 1977: Figure 2, 1979: Plates 51-2). Chaloupka captions the photo (1977:247 Plate 2, here Plate 2) 'Superimpositioning of three early styles'. In 1979 he writes about Plate 52 (identical to 1977: Plate 2): 'At left are flying foxes, while the kangaroo designs superimpose important dynamic figures (Plate 52) [emphasis mine].' There is no mention of a third, presumably Large Naturalistic style being superimposed in the painting. Indeed I was not able to find any Large Naturalistic style painting in this particular cluster, and Chaloupka does not mention the style in reference to the cluster. One drawing of a Dynamic style thylacine further west is interpreted as overlaying (with front paws?) an earlier Large Naturalistic style macropod (Chaloupka 1977:252 Figure 5). The painting of a macropod exhibits remarkably similar features to the macropod overlying paintings identified by Chaloupka as Dynamic style, and it is impossible to identify any features that are specifically of the Large Naturalistic style, such as being large and naturalistic or painted according to the definition of Large Naturalistic styles (1977:246-7). In the text (p.251), Chaloupka identifies the painting as 'contemporaneous with the large naturalistic designs'. Neither is the superimposition clear enough to evaluate the superimposition order. It is most likely a representation of a Dynamic style macropod (see Chaloupka 1977:250 Figure 3 for variety of Dynamic style macropod representations). Paintings in Yam style are superimposed on Dynamic style paintings (Plate 3). There is no overlap of any Dynamic with the identified and re-drawn earlier Large Naturalistic style paintings at either of these two sites (Plates 4 and 5). The paintings at Mt. Gilruth which Chaloupka identifies as being of the earlier Large Naturalistic style therefore cannot be shown to be from an earlier or later period. One can only assume that Chaloupka, in identifying Large Naturalistic style paintings (1977:248 Figure 2) as being earlier, used a priori reasoning from other Large Naturalistic style sites where these were overlaid by Dynamic figures. Indeed Chaloupka (1977:246) hints that other sites support the sequence: 'The Ml Gilruth sequence of styles has been confirmed at other sites in the region'. If that is the case, then subimposition of Large Naturalistic style Stick figures and those similar to the Female Anthropomorph under Dynamic figures must occur elsewhere and have not been presented by Chaloupka as yet. From the evidence at Mt. Gilruth one can infer only that Yam figures were painted some time after Dynamic figures, and that the large macropods were also painted after the Dynamic figures. The Mt. Gilruth data also suggest that Stick figures were painted after the Female Anthropomorph. Chaloupka does not discuss why the Stick figures and red-outline-and-wash figures should be considered a part of the same style as Female Anthropomorph and the like. No chronological correlation between Dynamic style and Large Naturalistic style can be deduced from Mt. Gilruth evidence. There are other, later styles at the two sites, particularly X-ray descriptive and X-ray decorative styles, despite Chaloupka's assertion to the contrary (1979). This is important evidence that people never stopped visiting the two sites. They painted not only the paintings in recognised later styles, but might conceivably also have altered or 65</page><page sequence="6">re-painted some of the paintings of the earlier styles, as I believe they did. The Mt. Gilruth evidence presented by Chaloupka (1977 and 1979) does not offer any evidence for the relative chronology between the Dynamic style and 'the two distinct forms of Large Naturalistic style'. What is shown is that the Stick figures with fighting picks (or spearthrowers) overlaid the Female Anthropomorph with a head design similar to Yam style representations. Both kinds of design were classified by Chaloupka as Large Naturalistic style. There are also examples of Yam figures overlaying Dynamic figures. In addition, there is evidence that the large macropods overlay the Dynamic figures. I hoped to find an answer at Mt. Gilruth to the first part of my enquiry into the definition and chronological position of Large Naturalistic style, but there was no conclusive evidence for, or positive proof of Chaloupka's proposition. I then turned to the photographs, drawings and descriptions of paintings from other sites in the published material, in which Chaloupka identified some paintings as Large Naturalistic style. Plate 4.

Arrows indicate superposition shown in Fig. 5. 66</page><page sequence="7">Plate 5. A detail of Plate 5 showing the superimposition sequence. Additional evidence Considering these paintings, Chaloupka (1983:21 and 1985:274) repeats his above assertions (1983:8) and shows five drawings of figures which he identifies as Large Naturalistic style. No painting is overlaid by Dynamic style painting, nor is such a superimposition mentioned. A freshwater crocodile identified as Large Naturalistic style (1983:21) is the one shown as a photograph in another publication (1984:21). The painting of the crocodile is not overlaid by any other painting. It is drawn as the last in a series of paintings which almost completely cover the rock surface (1983:21). Chaloupka logically interprets all other underlying paintings as also belonging to the same Large Naturalistic style (according to his model it is the first figurative style). There is no overlay of Dynamic style paintings and consequently no positive proof of these paintings preceding Dynamic style exists at the site. Also it is improbable that in an area as attractive and often frequented as the one in which the painting is located, people would not paint for 25,000 years following the freshwater crocodile painting. Indeed white eyes on the crocodile (an obvious addition) and an X-ray decorative white painting of a macropod next to the crocodile show the X-ray decorative style people were visiting the area. Also, the many paintings underneath the painting of the Large Naturalistic style crocodile would make this a most unusual site, as no other Large Naturalistic style site of such density and variety of paintings has been found. Chaloupka includes drawings of animals as Large Naturalistic style paintings (1983:21 Figure 1.2d, e) and claims they are representations of extinct animals. Lewis (1988) has questioned the validity of that claim. Neither of the paintings or drawings of the paintings are overlaid by Dynamic figures and we must rely again on Chaloupka' s assertion about their relative chronological position. A redrawn figure (1983:21 Figure 1.2b) of a man with an erect penis is stylistically similar to the Female Anthropomorph at Mt. Gilruth. Chaloupka identifies these figures as being of the same style. I concur with this finding. However no Dynamic style superimposition occurs at the site. Brandi (1982:154 and Figure 89) and Chaloupka (1984: 30 Figure 10) both show a Dynamic style painting with the obvious addition of a spearthrower/fighting pick painted in the hands of a man and an animal-headed anthropomorph. The reproduced photograph of the painting is not clear enough to ascertain the superimposition order of the Dynamic figures and a large snake, a flying fox and a hand stencil. The character of these paintings does not conform to any of Chaloupka's definitions of Large Naturalistic style or schemata. Neither researcher interprets the painting superimposition sequence. If indeed the Dynamic style paintings were painted later at this site, this would be the first evidence offered by Chaloupka of an art style existing prior to the Dynamic style. No other written or pictorial evidence of a chronological relationship between Dynamic and Large Naturalistic styles is offered. From Chaloupka's evidence to date, it is impossible to conclude that the style called Large Naturalistic precedes the Dynamic style. The evidence from the two Mt. Gilruth sites does not support Chaloupka's assertion about the relative chronology of the two styles. The discrepancy between Chaloupka's and my interpretation is not based on different explanations of the data; there is no superimposition of Dynamic figures and Chaloupka's Large Naturalistic figures (1977:248 Figure 2) in any combination to be found at the two sites or in any additional information offered. There is also no evidence presented to explain why the two, or three, substantially different 'schemata' of Large Naturalistic style should be considered as belonging to one style. No other evidence is offered to support either proposition. (This is not to say that the possibility of a style preceding Dynamic should be excluded.) So far no evidence has been presented to establish a relative chronological sequence between the Dynamic and the Large Naturalistic style in any of its schemata. What then is the chronological relationship between these painting styles? To reiterate, there are two styles, Dynamic (D) and Yam (Y), where the relative chronology has been established at Mt. Gilruth, and there is Chaloupka's Large Naturalistic (LN) style, consisting of two, sometimes three or five different schemata. The stylistic connection between these schemata has not been established. Chaloupka (1977) states that the Stick figures (L2) are, in the case of the Mt. Gilruth sites, painted over the Female Anthropomorph (LI). Assuming that we do not know the 67</page><page sequence="8">chronological relationship, from the evidence we can propose a number of possible sequences. This proposition assumes that all the styles did not co-exist at the same time and that LI and L2 groups of designs are stylistically and chronologically independent. Table 2 contains a number of possible arrangements of relative chronological order of the Mt. Gilruth paintings based only on the evidence from the two Mt Gilruth sites. The relative age is implied by the position from left to right (left being the oldest). LI + L2 - D - Y (Chaloupka) D - Y - LI + L2 D - LI - Y - L2 LI - D - L2 - Y D - LI - L2 - Y LI - D - Y - L2 LI - L2 - D - Y D - Y - LI - L2 D + LI - Y + L2 D - L1+ Y - L2 Table 2. Possible chronologies of Mt. Gilruth paintings. Styles: D = Dynamic; Y = Yam; LI = Female Anthropomorph (and the like); L2 = Stick figures with spears and fighting pick/spearthrower; + between = together with; - between = followed by. To discover which one of these variants is valid, I had to acquire more data, which would show beyond question the superimposition sequence. I now believe I have enough data to complete the interpretation, and to show the existence of other styles in the sequence. An interpretation of the Mt. Gilruth sequence Prior to this research I had noticed a puzzling similarity between the Yam and the Large Naturalistic style paintings. However it was only when I found Large Naturalistic style paintings overlaying Yam paintings that I felt the need to reappraise Chaloupka's (1977 and 1983) findings (Plate 6). I discussed the find with Chaloupka (1988). He objected that the re-painted legs of the figure were a later addition and therefore the find does not invalidate his assertion, which at the time appeared quite valid. Further field work revealed that the legs of human figures in the Large Naturalistic style ' are often re-painted as in the earlier example, although this finding could not of course be used by itself as evidence for an interpretation of the sequence. Re-examination of the site (Plate 6) has shown that the Yam figure is overlaid by both the original and the re-painted version of the figure. Until very recently (Plate 7) no other data has been found for an alternative interpretation of the Mt. Gilruth sequence of the so-called Large Naturalistic style and Yam style. The photograph in Plate 7 shows a Large Naturalistic figure, this time with no re-painting of the legs and beneath it Yam style painting of a bird. This allows us to interpret the chronological order of the two styles. The painting of a Large Naturalistic style man with a 'fighting pick' (Plate 7) is undoubtedly painted in the same style as the painting of a woman from Mt. Gilruth and other figures of the Large Naturalistic style. 'These oldest representations are executed as line paintings, in which the whole of the figure is filled with lines which follow the outline of the body, its appendages and contours' (Chaloupka 1977). The similarity of the design (the head in particular) between this and Yam style paintings has been noted already by Chaloupka. It is painted over an earlier painting of a Yam style bird. I believe this to be clear evidence that justifies a re-arrangement of the Mt Gilruth sequence, placing LI style after Yam style. A number of observations support this reappraisal of the relative chronology. For example, an inspection of other figures painted in Large Naturalistic style reveals many similarities between it and the earlier Yam style. Chaloupka (1977:249) himself noticed one, the shape and design of the head: 'The female anthropomorph ... is painted in this early large design style ... (fig. 2a). The shape of its head is similar to that of the later "yam" representations. ' Other similarities Plate 6. A Yam style human figure (bottom right) superimposed by a Large Naturalistic style painting of a human (here two pairs of legs). The re-painting of the original Large Naturalistic figure complicates interpretation. However the Yam figure is superimposed by both the original and later re-painted Large Naturalistic painting.

About 120 cm. are the 'knotted string' motif (Plates 8, 9) and a horizontal line often painted across the upper half of the head (Plate 9). The distribution of the Yam style paintings and Large Naturalistic style paintings coincides to a large degree. Both are concentrated around similar environmental niches such as swamps and rainforests, suggesting that the exploitation patterns and therefore the environment for both Yam and Large Naturalistic style peoples were similar. It is my opinion that the Large Naturalistic style evolved from or immediately followed the original Yam style. (It is tempting to predict a partial overlap of the two styles, however clear evidence is very scarce as it is.) I am therefore convinced that Chaloupka's interpretation of the Mt. Gilruth sequence is not only unsupported by any evidence but that in accordance with the newly acquired data the Mt. Gilruth art sequence should be rearranged as follows: 1) Dynamic style 2) Yam style 3) Large Naturalistic style 4) Stick figures. I do not wish to make too many comments on the Stick figures, Yam figures, and other post- Yam styles because of the uncertainty surrounding the linear chronological model of painting styles. However, one obvious anomaly, which Chaloupka was unable to explain in a logical manner, was the presence of a spearthrower (later reinterpreted as a Plate 10. Large Naturalistic style painting of a human with Yam style head and hair-style. About 1.5 m long. 70</page><page sequence="11">fighting pick) in the hand of a Stick figure man (of Chaloupka's Large Naturalistic style) before and after the Dynamic period but not during the Dynamic period. According to Chaloupka (1977, 1983) the Dynamic period lasted approx. 10,000 years. It is clear now from the data presented here, that the painting of the tool in the Stick figure man's hand and the painting of the man are themselves from a much later Yam (?) and post- Yam periods, where there is plentiful evidence for the use of both the fighting pick and the spearthrower, as well as the three-pronged fishing spear. It is of considerable interest that at the site where I found the Large Naturalistic style painting overlaying the Yam style painting we also found a painting of a Yam style man in association with a fighting stick. I believe this to be the first evidence for a technology associated with the Yam style paintings. (Since then another, isolated, painting of a large Yam man with a fighting pick or a spearthrower has been found.) Archaic paintings On the same day we found the Large Naturalistic style painting overlaying the Yam style painting (Plate 7), I also found, about 100 meters from this painting, a Dynamic style figure overlaying an earlier painting, to my knowledge the very first such superimposition recorded (Plates 10-12). This painting clearly shows that paintings prior to the Dynamic style were executed in red and white. The Dynamic style figure overlays both red and white lines of the earlier figure. This figure is executed only in a thick red line, outlined by a thinner white line - probably a silhouette of a person. This is the first piece of published evidence that there were other paintings possibly before the Dynamic style which were painted in red and white. I would like to provisionally call paintings of this pre-Dynamic period (?) Archaic style paintings. This is partially due to the established association between Chaloupka' s Large Naturalistic style and the name of the style, and partially to indicate its likely position in the chronological sequence. It is possible that the Archaic style paintings will be shown to be contemporanepous with the Dynamic style, however the evidence for that is not available yet. There is some measure of similarity between this Archaic style painting and the paintings of a snake and two flying foxes shown by Brandi (1982 Plate 31, Figure 83), and Chaloupka (1984 Figure 10) neither of which unfortunately gives an indication of the superimposition sequence. Anonymous text accompanying Chaloupka' s photo on cover of 'Form in the indigenous art' (Ucko ed. 1977) interprets the composition in reverse chronological order. These paintings possibly precede the Dynamic style, but without seeing them it is impossible to comment further. Finally, at the Archaic painting site there is also a Dynamic style painting overlaying a hand stencil, thus suggesting that the hand stencils were already being executed some time before the Dynamic style. Discussion What does this re-interpretation of the Western Arnhem Land chronological sequence mean in terms of Chaloupka's model? First of all it appears that Chaloupka's division of styles into large 'evolutionary phases' (Table 1) such as Naturalistic, Intellectual realism, etc., is no longer applicable. This is because the basis for this appraisal of styles in evolutionary or perceived clusters is no longer valid due to the rearrangement of styles in relation to one another. Bate 1 1.

A detail of Archaic style painting, showing red and white paint of Archaic style human (Plate 11) superimposed by Dynamic style figures. Note the thick and heavy red line, probably characteristic of the style. Second, it appears that the antiquity of the art must be revised. Lewis (1988) has already provided a more informed and better based interpretation of the absolute chronology for the Arnhem Land art sequence. The reinterpretation of the Mt. Gilruth relative sequence suggests that a sizeable amount of the art which Chaloupka asserted was among the most ancient of the sequence is in fact post- Yam, that is about 5500 years old. Assuming that Lewis's proposed absolute chronology is still applicable, the quantitative shift between styles and the re-arrangement of the stylistic sequence itself would undermine Chaloupka's claims for the great antiquity of the art. Working hypothesis To estimate the absolute age of the beginning of the Arnhem Land rock art sequence or the beginning of the Dynamic style is not simple. However it appears that all the styles following and including the Dynamic style have a kind of logical continuity. Indeed, it is possible that understanding the origin and knowing the absolute date for the beginning of the Dynamic style will provide the base for an interpretation of the Arnhem Land Plateau rock art sequence. First, we have evidence that red ochre was already being used 18,000 years ago (Kamminga and Allen 1977). Second, we may now have evidence that people lived in the area for some 55,000 years (Roberts, Jones and Smith 199Ö), using haematite. Third, it is difficult to reconcile the record of the archaeological sequence with any of the proposed rock art chronological sequences. This is particularly true of estimates of the beginning of the sequence, and of the beginning of the Dynamic style. Allen in his thorough review of the Kakadu archaeological evidence (1989) suggested 6 archaeological phases: 25,000 - 18,000, 18,000 - 7000, 7000-5000, 5000-3000, 3000- 1000 and 1000- 200 BP. This divison is not based purely on stone tool technology, but is rather holistic, including the environmental phases. It appears now that the Pleistocene phases may require a revision in view of the new work by Roberts, Jones and Smith (1990), which suggest the begining of the sequence 50 - 60,000 BP. The Dynamic style appears to be central to the understanding of Western Arnhem Land rock art chronology, as it is from this style onwards that some kind of cohesion and continuity of tradition can be perceived. Chaloupka set the beginning of the Dynamic style period after 20,000 years BP. Although he does not give any reason for this, I suspect that it was in reference to the beginning of C. White's (1967) archaeological sequence at Malangangerr, now Mala1 ngan.girr (after Harvey 1990). It now appears that the archaeological period in question may have started some 30,000 - 40,000 years earlier, about 55,000 years ago. Lewis (1988) estimates the beginning of his Boomerang (Chaloupka's Dynamic style) period to be 12,000 years ago. Lewis envisages that this painting period is a final product of people of a desert culture, who, presumably forced by the rising sea levels, diminishing availability of the land and consequent exposure to coastal people, started painting. This is a difficult proposition to accept. Such an interpretation does not account for the lack of any stylistic intecedent to, or the overwhelming homogeneity of, the Dynamic style. My working hypothesis is that the people painting in the Dynamic style are themselves the emigrants displaced from their original habitat in marginal areas by the rising sea level and by coastal people at about 13,000 years BP. This hypothesis would help explain the similarity between Dynamic style paintings and the Bradshaw figures of the Kimberley region in Western Australia. It is possible that these two similar painting styles, painted presumably by related people, have a similar origin. A common origin of the styles in the now submerged Arafura river basin is suggested by the related painting techniques, the distinct, idiosyncratic hair arrangement of the people portrayed, and the same tool assemblage. The hypothesis would also account for the sudden appearance and homogeneity of the Dynamic style. The technology in the artefactual record is continuous between 25,000 and 7000 years ago (White 1967). A change in technology, or an apparent lack of it, does not have to correlate with a change or a lack of change in the art styles of the region, as a stylistic boundary between two groups of people (even a chronological one) does not presuppose a technological distinction (Clarke 1968). 72</page><page sequence="13">Woodroffe, Chappell and Thorn (1988) in their work on geomorphological evolution of the South Alligator floodplain, established several geomorphological periods. I have for a convenience added an earlier pre-transgressional period. Periods years BP Pre-transgressional 9000 Transgressional 9000-6800 Big Swamp 6800-5300 Sinuous 5300-2500 Cuspate 2500 - present I would therefore put the date for the beginning of the Dynamic period in Western Arnhem Land at about 11,000 years ago, before the beginning of the Transgressional period which starts at approximately 9000 BP (Woodroffe et al. 1989). This is estimated from the date of 14,000 BP when the sea level started rising and an approximate time the people displacement resulting from the rise, would bring the Dynamic style people of coastal margins into the area. An a priori argument, such as that advocated by Rosenfeld in a paper delivered at Darwin AURA Congress 1988, seems to preclude any consideration of an homogeneous style surviving intact for 12,000 years or more, as Chaloupka's model suggests, without an obvious drift of stylistic indicators. The new finding of the late Yam style figure with a spear thrower/fighting pick related to spear-point assemblage (Plate 9) which started after approximately 6800 BP (Jones, ed. 1986) would indicate that the Yam style ended at about this time (7000 BP). This seems to indicate a terminal date for the Dynamic style of 8000 years BP, not to 9000 BP as Chaloupka proposes, specially as Post-dynamic and Simple-figures-with-boomerangs (being between the two above styles) are numerically and regionally minor styles. I would also advocate the coexistence of a number of stylistic groups during the Big Swamp period and ending at the beginning of the Cuspate period with the appearance of the pan-Arnhem X-ray art complex (Haskovec 1989). There is no evidence for a clear correlation between the changes of geomorphic periods and changes of styles. Indeed a number of different styles appearing at this time, point to styles as an expression or identification of social units. Indeed, quite distinct recent X-ray paintings of Jawoyn and Gun-jheibmi people often appear side by side (Tacon 1987, Gunn 1987). The reference to geomorphology and climate helps to identify approximate absolute dates of the painting styles through likely economic activities, tools and target species of the people portrayed. At about the end of Sinuous period, around 2500 BP, new additional technology is introduced, i.e., specialized spearthrowers, canoes, etc., and the dingo also appears at this time. These artefacts are portrayed in the art of the period, which is a complex of substyles referred to as X-ray art (Tacon 1987). So far the final chapter is the beginning of the contact period paintings, which portray European technology, animals, cloth, written text, etc., sometimes in X-ray tradition, sometimes in a new art style, which may be a result of the activities of Oenpelli Mission. This period is still continuing. It would be wise to consider that the question of the relative and absolute chronology of rock art is not going to be settled for some time yet. Other aspects of the art, such as functional variations in styles, geographical distribution of art styles, discovery of new styles, new dating techniques, better definition of known styles, etc., are still awaiting our attention. Our models and working hypotheses will have to be constantly re-assessed in the light of new data. Acknowledgments There are number of people who greatly assisted with the work. Ms Hilary Sullivan, Mr Fred Nagawali and Mr Phil Crews shared the joys and misery of a prolonged field trip on the plateau. Mr Nagawali in fact discovered some of the key sites mentioned in this paper. Hilary Sullivan, John Clegg, and Nan McNab patiently read the earlier versions of the paper, pointing to the incoherencies and shortcomings of some arguments. Australian National Parks and Wildife Service in the person of the Park Manager provided the logistic and other support necessary to complete the work. To all these people go my thanks.
