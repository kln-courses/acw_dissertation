<plain_text><page sequence="1">'AMOR AND HIS BROTHER CUPID': THE 'TWO LOVES' IN HEINRICH VON VELDEKE'S E ' By ARTHUR GROOS Most scholars who have studied the medieval adaptations of Virgil's epic masterpiece agree that the principal change introduced to the story by the Roman oVEneas and Heinrich von Veldeke's Eneit involves the Dido and Lavinia episodes.1 In general terms, the first four books of the Aeneid have been reduced in scope to the story of Dido, whereas Virgil's brief references to Lavinia in later books have been expanded into an independent love intrigue several thousand lines in length, creating a bipartite epic which anticipates the structure of Arthurian romance. There is considerably less unanimity of opinion concerning the nature and function of these two episodes in Veldeke's Eneit. The argument has circled for the most part around the question whether the loves of Dido and Lavinia for Eneas can be differentiated in terms of ' unrehte ' and ' rehte minne ' or in terms of fate and external circumstances.2 The following study focuses on a basic element of the work which has largely been ignored but could clarify the dispute: the distribution and roles of the gods of love in the two episodes. Many commentators have noted that Heinrich von Veldeke follows the lead of his French source in deleting references to individual deities by referring to them collectively as 'die gote,' but generally excludes Venus, Amor, and Cupid from this process of demythologization.3 The two works differ, however, in several important respects. Veldeke incorporates the deities of love into his story with greater frequency and differentiates between them to a greater extent. 1 Cited here according to the editions of Jacques Salverda de Grave (Bibliotheca Nor mannica 4; Halle 1891) and Ludwig Ettm?ller (Dichtungen des deutschen Mittelalters 8; Leipzig 1852). 2 See Friedrich Maurer, * "Rechte" Minne bei Heinrich von Veldeke/ Archiv 187 (1950) 1-9, expanded in Leid: Studien zur Bedeutungs- und Problemgeschichte (Bern and Munich 1951) 98-114.

After noting that a differentiation between Amor and Cupid is frequently found in Middle High German literature after the Eneit, Ludwig Denecke asserts that Veldeke's inadequate education gave birth to this 'little mistake* and that his influence assured its popularity among later writers:4 Es ergibt sich jedenfalls, dass die Anschauung von einer Zweiheit Amor Cupido bei den mittelalterlichen Dichtern keineswegs allgemein ist. . . . Vielmehr ist Veldeke derjenige, der das Missverst?ndnis zustandegebracht hat. ... So haben wir das Vergn?gen, einmal an der Wiege der ' Anschauung eines Zeitalters' zu stehen, und erfahren dabei, dass das kluge Kind ? durch einen kleinen Fehltritt ? zur Welt kam. Veldekes Lateinkenntnisse waren nicht sehr umfassend, aber sie m?ssen doch zur ?bersetzung der Servatius legende ausgereicht haben. Although this conclusion has, with some reservations, been cited as a matter of course by later writers, and although the synonymity of Amor and Cupid appears to be a general assumption,5 the evidence in this instance admits of another interpretation. Veldeke's 'mistaken' distinction between Amor and Cupid is in fact related to a mythographic commonplace in classical and medie val Latin literature known as the ' Two Loves. ' Inasmuch as this topos appears in a variety of forms, some of which are important for the study of other writers,6 it may prove useful to survey the history of the 'Two Loves' before proceeding to a discussion of their unusually sophisticated treatment in the Eneit 4 Ritterdichter und Heideng?tter (1150 220) (Form und Geist 13; Leipzig 1930) 98f.

From the very beginnings of ancient Greek literature, there appear to be two major traditions regarding the origin and nature of the deities of love, theogenic and epic, according to which Aphrodite and Eros are either included among the first Urwesen emerging from primeval chaos or are con sidered as the offspring of Olympian deities.7 The most influential discussion of love, at least for the purposes of the present investigation, begins with Plato's Symposium, where Pausanias combines the theogenic and Olympian genealogies in order to draw a comparison between two Aphrodites, Urania and Pandemos, and two corresponding Erotes:8 True, if [Aphrodite] were one, then Love would be one: but since there are two of her, there must needs be two Loves also. Does anyone doubt that she is double ? Surely there is the elder, of no mother born, but daughter of Heaven, whence we name her Heavenly; while the younger was the child of Zeus and Dione, and her we call Popular. It follows then that of the two Loves also the one ought to be called Popular, as fellow-worker with the one of those goddesses, and the other Heavenly. (180 D-E) This passage rapidly became a common point of departure for other discourses on the 'Two Loves' in Xenophon's Symposium (8.9-10), Plutarch's Moralia (764 A-B) and Plotinus' Enneads (3.5.1-2). Similar comparisons also attained considerable popularity during late Greek antiquity in such disparate contexts as poetry and patristic writings, reappearing in the Renaissance, most notably in the philosophy of Ficino and in paintings such as Titian's 'Sacred and Profane Love.'9 7 See Ludwig Preller and Carl Robert, Griechische Mythologie (4th rev. ed.; Berlin 1894) 1.352ff. and 501ff.; Otto Gruppe, Griechische Mythologie und Religionsgeschichte (Munich 1906) 2.1071?. and 1343ff.; and the articles 'Aphrodite/ 'Eros/ and 'Urania' in RE 1.2769ff., 6.484ff., 2.

On the topos</page><page sequence="4">242 TRADITIO Tracing the further history of the topos appears difficult at first glance, because many works of Greek literature, particularly those of the Alexandrine age, blur the earlier philosophical differentiation by pluralizing the individual deities of love and making indiscriminate references to them a conventional practice. This tendency is generally representative of the Roman literary tradition, where the Greek Erotes and Pothoi are translated into their equiv alents, the familiar Amores and Cupidines which flutter so industriously but synonymously through the verses of Latin love poetry. In other forms of Latin literature, such as Lucretius' De rerum natura, the goddess known as the Venus genetrix retains ? in addition to her usual political overtones ? a double function as the symbol of the cosmic force which unites all creation in universal concord (l.lff.) and as the symbol of sensual desire as well (4.1058ff.). Ovid draws an explicit distinction between these two aspects of love at the beginning of the fourth book of the Fasti, where he emphasizes the unity underlying the diversity of his present philosophical theme and his former amorous dalliances, invoking the Venus genetrix as the subject of both en deavors and as the mother of the 'Twin Loves' before proceeding to her descendants in the line of Aeneas: 'Alma, fave,' dixi, 'geminorum mater Amorum I' 'tu mihi propositum, tu mihi semper opus, quae decuit, primis sine crimine lusimus annis, nunc teritur nostris area maior equis, tempora cum causis, annalibus eruta priscis, lapsaque sub terras ortaque signa cano.' (4.1ff.) Although Ovid's invocation of the 'geminorum mater Amorum' and similar references to the 'geminus Cupido' in Seneca's Oedipus (500) and Phaedra (275) do not precisely identify the nature of the figures involved,10 there is ample evidence that Latin literature was familiar with the Greek distinction between the genealogies of Eros and associated it with a distinction between Amor and Cupid. The major Roman mythographical treatise, Cicero's De natura deorum, merely enumerates the genealogies of Venus (3.23.59), but adopts the distinction between the theogenic and Homeric traditions regarding Eros: Amor is the first of a series of personified emotions born from Chaos (3.17.44), whereas Cupid is a mythological deity, the offspring of Venus and other Olympian gods (3.23.60). Different genealogies of the two figures also in the Renaissance, see: Edgar Wind, Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance (New Haven, Conn. 1958) 118ff., and Erwin Panofsky, Problems in Titian, Mostly Iconographie (New York 1969) 109-38. 10 Denecke's assertion that the 'Cupido geminus* in Phaedra 'heisst hier der ?hnliche, das heisst: der Mutter ?hnliche' (101) is implausible.</page><page sequence="5">HEINRICH VON VELDEKE'S E ' 243 appear to have been known to medieval mythographers: ' Iuppiter cum Venere filia sua concubuit, de qua genuit Cupidinem. Nam Amorem genuit in seipsa sive usu maris Venus, vel ut alii ex Marte, ut alii asserunt ex Vulcano. 'u Philosophical speculation on the nature of the 'Two Loves' also continued in various forms in Latin literature, as is evidenced by the commentary of Lactantius Placidus on the Thebaid (4.527),12 and by Apuleius' extended paraphrase of the seminal passage from the Symposium, where the attributes of the two Aphrodites, Urania and Pandemos, are translated by caelitis and vulgaria, and the contrast between the emotions they represent is illustrated with a quotation from Afranius which associates amor with a wise love, cupido with carnal desire: mitto enim dicere alta illa et diuina Platonica, rarissimo cuique philosopho rum ignara, ceterum omnibus profanis incognita: geminam esse Venerem deam, proprio quam que amore et diuersis amato ribus pollentis; earum alte ram uulgariam, quae sit percita populari amore, non modo humanis animis, uerum etiam pecuinis et ferinis ad libidinem imperitare . . . alteram uero caelitem Venerem, praeditam [quae sit] optimati amore, solis hominibus et eorum paucis curare, nullis ad turpitudinem stimulis uel illecebris sectatores suos percellentem. . . . quapropter, ut semper, eleganter Afranius hoc scriptum relinquat: 'amabit sapiens, cupient ceteri. ' (Apologia 12) More significant for the purposes of this study than the continuity of the Platonic tradition is the fact that Servius, the most widely read commentator on Virgil's Aeneid during the Middle Ages, also quotes Afranius as well as Plautus in associating Amor with a wise love and Cupid with an immoderate passion, and attributes the latter to the affair of Dido and Aeneas, who are 'regnorum immemores turpique cupidine captos' (4.194):13 CVPIDINE: (cupidinem) veteres inmoderatum amorem dicebant: Afranius, 'alius est Amor, alius Cupido' [Cinerarius frag. 3], 'amabit sapiens, cupient 11 Virginia Brown, 'An Edition of an Anonymous Twelfth-Century Liber de natura deorum, ' Mediaeval Studies 34 (1972) 15. The attribution of Cupid's paternity to Jupiter is unusual, but see Euripides, Hyppolytus 534; Virgil, Ciris 132; Apuleius, Metamorphoses 6.22; Lactantius, Institutions divinae 1.17.9. The genealogy of Amor has been adapted from Servius (1.664) or Vatican Mythographer II (cap. 35). For a later summa of views on the various genealogies of Amor and Cupid, see Boccaccio, Genealogie deorum gentilium libri, ed. Vincenzo Romano (Scrittori d'Italia 200-1; Bari 1951) I 46f., 83, 142-44, 148f., 152; II 451, 543-45. 12 'Pythagoras dicit duo esse hemisphaeria, quibus proprios deos assignat ... et duas Veneres: unam supernam et alteram Libitinam,, ed.

As these citations suggest, the contrast between Cupid and Amor as well as the emotions which they personify, expressed in terms of an antithesis or a progression, was a familiar if not commonplace one in classical Latin literature. Other distinctions occur in Plautus' Mostellaria (163), on inscriptions (CIL 4.1927), and in a fragment of Cicero's De legibus quoted in the Institutiones divinae of Lactantius (1.20.14), where Eros and Anteros, 'Love' and 'Love Returned, ' are translated by Cupid and Amor.14 Although these works cannot themselves have had any significant effect on the transmission of the 'Two Loves' and the differentiation between Amor and Cupid, they nonetheless exerted considerable influence as excerpts in classical and medieval dictionaries. Book 5 of Nonius Marcellus' De compendiosa doctrina, for example, begins with a discussion of love, citing Plautus and Afranius as examples of the differences between the two: CVPIDO et AMOR idem significare videntur. et est diversitas. cupido enim inconsideratae est necessitatis, amor iudicii. Plautus Bacchidibus: 'Cupidon te consevit anne Amor?' idem in Cureulione discrevit et vim eiusdem diversitatis expressit dicens: 'quod Venu' Cupidoque imperat suadetque Amor.' Afranius in Omine: 'amabit sapiens, cupient ceteri.' (3.681) With Isidore of Seville's Differentiae (1.5), which quotes Porcius Cato's oration against L. Quinctius Flamininus in support of a sequential but ethically opposite relationship between Amor and Cupid, the differentiation between the two entered the medieval lexicographical tradition:15 '"Aliud est," inquit Cato, "Philippe, amor longe, aliudque cupido. Accessit illico alter ubi alter recessit: alter bonus, alter malus." Alii verius amorem et bonum dixerunt et malum, cupidinem semper malum' (PL 83.9f.). In accordance with these and obvious etymological distinctions between the two words, Latin and Middle High German dictionaries gloss amor with 'liebe' or 'minne,' cupido with 'begierde.' It is thus not surprising that references to Frauwe Amur and Cupido in Eilhart 14 'Magnum Cicero audaxque consilium suscepisse Graeciam dixit, quod Cupidinum et Amorum simulacra in gymnasiis consecrasset ' (CSEL 19.74). Denecke's assertion that Cicero's '"simulacra Cupidinum et Amorum" aber k?nnen sich nicht auf zwei G?tter Amor und Cupido beziehen, da die Griechen einen ausgebildeten Kult des einen Eros hatten' (101) contradicts Pausanias ' well-known description of devotion to Eros and Anteros in gymnasia (6.23.5). 15 See, for example, the Glossarium Ansileubi, ed. W. M. Lindsay (Glossarla Latina 1; Paris 1926) 50.</page><page sequence="7">HEINRICH VON VELDEKE'S E ' 245 von Oberge's Tristrant (2464-67) were later glossed with 'liebin' and 'begird' respectively.16 The distinction between Amor and Cupid which most strongly influenced the tradition of medieval mythography was introduced in Martianus Capella's De nuptiis Philologiae et Merciirii, which presents Amor as a figure who is not the offspring of the Venus voluptaria and who, in contrast to her son Cupid, is allowed to participate in the wedding procession. A radiant youth enters, 'qui nec uoluptariae Veneris filius erat, et tarnen Amor a sapientibus fereba tur . . . nam Cupido, corporeae uoluptatis illex, licet earn semper anteuolet, Philologiae occursibus non ausus est interesse' (2.144-48).17 Although the ' puer renidens ' resembles the Eros Uranos or Amor caelestis of the theogenic platonic tradition, Martianus' uniquely turgid narrative did not clarify his relationship to the other two figures, leaving later commentators to resolve the uncertainty in a more typically medieval fashion. The traditional interpretation of this passage, introduced by John Scottus Eriugena and expanded by Remigius of Auxerre, resorts to the classical topos of the ' Two Loves, ' but reduces the original genealogical distinction to an ethical one applied in bono to a Venus casta and Amor, and in malo to a Venus voluptaria and Cupid:18 Duae sunt Veneres, una casta et pudica quae praeest honestis amoribus, quae etiam fertur uxor Vulcani, altera voluptuaria libidinum dea. . . . Sic etiam sunt duo amores, alter bonus et pudicus quo virtutes et sapientia amantur, alter impudicus et malus, quem ad distinctionem boni amoris pluraliter amores dicimus. (62.11) Remigius' gloss was exceptionally influential, as is indicated by its adoption by a host of later writers.19 In view of the popularity of the ' Two Loves, ' it is not at all surprising to find the topos widely employed in Latin literature of the High Middle Ages. The most imaginative adaptations of the ' two Venuses ' were undertaken by the 16 See Georg Diefenbach, Glossarium latino-germanicum mediae et infimae aetatis (Frank furt/Main 1857) 31 and 163; Eilhart, ed.

Alan of Lille's De planctu Naturae establishes a similar narrative framework in which two aspects of Venus battle each other for the domination of man, 'Venus in Venerem pug nans,' the agent of Nature who was originally designated to regulate the regeneration of the human species and the agent of fallen man's sexual perver sion. The distinction between Amor and Cupid is also not uncommon. It was used in commentaries on the Fasti, where Ovid's invocation of the 'geminorum mater Amorum ' is elucidated by Remigius' gloss on Martianus' differentiation of Amor and Cupid and by the additional observation that the one Venus functions here as the mother of the 'twin loves': 'Sed notandum quod hie una uenus quae apud romanos proprie genitrix uocatur quae mater utriusque amoris secundum ouidium nominatur. '21 It also appears in such poems as Carmina Burana 78, where, as is the case with numerous classical antecedents, the deities of love symbolize a progression from the initial wound of Venus' arrow and the fire of passion aroused by Cupid's torch to Amor's inspiration of love itself:22 Venus me telo vulneravit aureo, quod cor penetravit, Cupido faces instillavit, Amor amorem inspiravit iuvencule, pro qua volo mori. II The distribution of the gods of love in Heinrich von Veldeke's Eneit suggests that some adaptation of the ' Two Loves ' underlies the portrayal of the heroines: 20 See Winthrop Wetherbee, Platonism and Poetry in the Twelfth Century (Princeton, N. J. 1972) 104ff. especially 119-21, and 188-211; Bernard Silvestris (?), Commentimi super sex libros Eneidos Virgilii, ed. Wilhelm Riedel (Greifswald 1924) 9-12; Alan of Lille, ed.

Schu mann notes with some puzzlement that the capitalization of Amor ' und damit das Nebenein ander von Cupido und Amor ist wohl nicht zu umgehen.' He has, however, presented a catalogue of classical figures in 73.4a-4b in such a way as to avoid the problem: 'Hoc Cupido concitus, / hoc amor innovatur' (p. 44). Editorial reduction of Amor to amor or Cupido to cupido on the presumption of the synonymity of the two deities is not uncommon in medieval Latin texts.</page><page sequence="9">HEINRICH VON VELDEKE'S '?NEIT' 247 Venus and Cupid are involved in the story of Dido, whereas in the case of Lavinia they are joined by their son and brother Amor, who appears only in this episode and is crucial to understanding its significance. The differences frequently ascribed to the two sons of Venus ? a one-sided, immoderate and unwise passion to Cupid; a wise, moderate and mutual love to Amor ? cannot, however, be ' applied ' to Dido and Lavinia in the rigid and moralistic manner of Servius and Bernard Silvestris or some modern scholars. Veldeke's more sophisticated literary analysis is characterized not only by different sets of deities in the Dido and Lavinia episodes, but also by deities with considerably different functions. To use the scholastic terminology employed by Dante in the V?ta nuova (cap. 25), they function in the former affair primarily as 'sustanzia' and in the latter as 'accidente in sustanzia,' i.e. as traditional mythological figures who initiate actions or intervene in them, and as personifications of actions or emotions initially generated by human agency.23 An interpretation of the epic which isolates either the nature of the heroines' loves or the circum stances surrounding them therefore risks ignoring what may be a more salient element of the two episodes, the differing interrelationship between each woman and the various forces represented by the deities of love: that between Dido and an external agency beyond her control, and that between Lavinia and the emotions aroused within her own heart. The Roman oVEneas presents the story of Dido in terms of an unusually learned and powerful ruler who is incapacitated and driven to madness by love: 'Amors l'a fait de sage fole' (1408).24 The role of the deities of love in this episode is therefore a minor one, limited principally to a brief appearance by Venus, who transfers the 'mortel poison' of love from Ascanius to Dido and Eneas. Veldeke's emphasis, however, is not on a 'before and after' analysis of the effects of love, but rather on the struggle of the two characters with the differing fates which are apportioned to them, Eneas's by the anonymous 'gote' who direct his mission, Dido's by Venus and Cupid, who function in the traditional manner of mythological deities, directly intervening in the action and imposing their will upon her emotions. Although Dido receives her fellow exile with unusual forwardness, Veldeke emphasizes in a lengthy excursus at the critical juncture that it is predominantly the compulsion exerted by Venus and 23 On this distinction, see G. S. Lewis, The Allegory of Love (Oxford 1936; rpt. New York 1964) 48ff., Hans Robert Jauss, ' Form und Auffassung der Allegorie in der Tradition der Psychomachia,' Medium aevum vivum: Festschrift f?r Walther Bulst, edd. H. R.

(35.37ff.) The traditional association of Venus and Cupid with a one-sided and im moderate passion in discussions of the ' Two Loves ' is also evidenced throughout this episode by the actions of the two deities as well as by Dido's responses to them. In contrast to the Roman d'Eneas, where Venus causes both the hero and heroine to become infatuated with each other by Ascanius' kisses, ' de l'un en l'altre enbat l'amor' (817), Eneas sits passively at Dido's side while she alone busses the youth and is inflamed with a 'starke minne': '?n?as b? ir saz / do si also brinnen began. / . . . done mohte si des niht eng?n, / si enm?ste in starke minnen' (38.18-23). Immediately thereafter the intervention of Venus and Cupid is emphasized by Veldeke's addition of the arrow and torch which they wield against Dido, weapons which arouse desire but do not cause its resolution:25 . . . V?n?s die str?le in daz herze gesch?z. sie leit ungemach gr?z, diu m?re frouwe D?d?. d? quam der h?re Cupid? mit s?ner vakelen dar z? und habet ir sp?te unde fr? daz f?re an die wunden. (38.38-39.5) 25 See 243-246 supra. Denecke argues (100) that the motif of Venus' arrow is not classical and that Veldeke cannot have known of Cupid's torch from the one locus in Ovid's Amores: 'So kennt der Dichter Venus und Cupido als Fremdnamen. ' In fact, however, the arrow of Venus is known from Greek antiquity onwards. See Preller-Robert, Griechische Mythologie 1.385 . 1, and 503. The motif has become quite popular by the time of the Carmina Burana (76.6, 22; 92.25; 107.26; 148.2a; 148a.2; 162a). Similarly, the motif of Cupid's torch has several classical antecedents and was assured widespread popularity during the Middle Ages by Isidore of Seville's Etymologiae (8.11.80) and Rabanus Maurus' De universo (PL 111.432).</page><page sequence="11">HEINRICH VON VELDEKE's '?NEIT* 249 Simultaneously, they anticipate the fact that her wound will not be healed and her passion will not be extinguished by the physical consummation of the relationship, 'iedoch enwas niht heil / diu wunde von der str?len' (64.28f.), but only when she stabs herself with Eneas's sword and falls onto the pyre which she has made of his gifts. Unlike her counterpart in the Roman, who 'ne set ki Ta sorprise' (1258), Dido immediately recognizes and begs for mercy from the figures who are responsible for her torment, ' si bat gen?den Cupid?n, / ?n?ases br?der, / und V?nerem sine m?der' (51.18-20). Since she perceives that her love for the liegeman of Paris is part of a deterministic concatenation of tragic affairs which began with the abduction of Helen and will conclude with her own destruction, 4 ouw? der vart, / daz P?ris Elenam nam / . . . daz wirt an mir gerochen / unsanfte unde sere' (52.10ff.), Dido does not yield immediately to love, as she does in the Roman d* Eneas, but struggles with her emotions (49.36ff. and 64.7ff.). It is again an external force, in the figure of Venus, which must coerce the realization of the desire which her agency has elicited, 'do m?ste daz werden, / des lange gegeret was' (63.4f.), assisting Eneas to overcome Dido's resistance: minnechliche her si bat, daz si in gewerde des si selbe gerde, (iedoch sprach si dar wider) und er legete sie dar nider, alsez V?n?s geriet: sine mohte sich erweren niet. (63.18-24) In view of the predominance of supernatural compulsion, it is not surprising that Dido alternately denies and forgives Eneas's equivocal behavior, reproaches and absolves herself, and finally implicates Venus and Cupid for instigating the love which has enthralled her: ?wer m?der V?n?s und ?wer br?der Cupid? die macheten mich vil unfr?, die mir daz herze habent genomen, daz mir m?gen niht gefromen alle mine sinne. ouw?, unsenfte minne, wie d? mich h?st bedwungen ! (76.22-29) Deprived of her reputation at Carthage and abandoned by her lover, she finds no other recourse than a self-sacrifice to the agents of her fate, ' dem gote von der minne / und Veneri der gotinne' (75.9f.), precipitating the conclusion which has become inevitable and is accordingly described with increasing urgency as 'wunderlich.'26 As befits Veldeke's interpretation of the entire 26 Veldeke emphasizes the external agency of Dido's death even further by attributing it also to the machinations of the devil (80.27-29).</page><page sequence="12">250 TRADITIO episode, Dido's epitaph replaces the Roman's lament for the loss of wisdom through love, 'mais ele ama trop folement, / saveirs ne li valut neient' (2143f.), with an emphasis on a fate which was beyond its control: 'daz was wunderlich gen?ch, / s? wise s? si was' (80.14f.). It is difficult to imagine two love affairs which appear to have so much in common and yet are so dissimilar as those of Dido and Lavinia. The fact that the two women experience the same physiological effects ? chills, fever, sleeplessness, etc. ? prescribed by medieval Ovidian psychology should not obscure the radical differences in each episode between the deities of love and their relation to the heroine. Again, a comparison with the Roman d'Eneas is instructive. Although Amors or the synonymous Cupid replaces Venus as the principal deity of the Lavinia episode, he remains essentially a concrete mytho logical personage, the 'fr?re charnels' (8923) of Eneas. As is the case with Venus, he intervenes in the actions of the protagonists, forcing each 'en sa baillie' (8647, 8655, 8686, 8924) without regard for his or her wishes: ' Voill? o non, amer l'estuet' (8061). Lavinia's question, 'que est amors?' (7890 and 7901), is accordingly answered not so much by Amata's initial catalogue of the effects of love as by the description of their agent, the deity Amors, whose features and accoutrements are reproduced in a portrait: [Amors] tient deus darz en sa main destre et une boiste en la senestre. . . . et si est peinz toz par figure por demonstrer bien sa nature: li darz mostre qu'il puet navrer et la boiste qu'il set saner. (7977ff.) Veldeke also introduces Amor only in the Lavinia episode, but allies him with Venus and relegates the entirely different figure of Cupid to another role. Unlike the deities throughout the Roman a"Eneas and the Dido episode of the Eneit, who are 'sustanzia' and function in the traditional manner of mythologi cal personages, Amor is primarily a personified emotion. Veldeke accord ingly modifies Lavinia's question and the order of her discussion with Amata on the 'facts of life,' having her ask first who Love is, 'wer is diu Minne?' (261.27), and then ask what love is, 'so saget mir denne waz minne is' (262.6). For Minne is not the corporeal offspring of Olympian gods, but like Cicero's Amor or the Amor caelestis of a christianized theogeny, is the invisible cosmic force which rules the universe from the beginning of creation to the Last Judgment: si is von aneginne gewaldich ?ber die werlt al und immer m?re wesen sal unz an den jungesten tach, daz ir nieman ne mach</page><page sequence="13">HEINRICH VON VELDEKe'S '?NEIT' 251 neheine w?s widerst?n, w?nde sie is s? get?n, daz mans ne h?ret noch ensiht. (261.28-35) The portrait of Amor is therefore not the likeness of an actual person, rendered ' toz par figure, ' but is the illustration of an allegory, the substance by which an 'accidente' or abstract is 'bezeichnet': d? h?st dicke wol gesehen, wie der h?re Amor st?t in dem templ?, d? man in g?t engegen der ture inne, daz bezeichent die Minne, diu gewaldech is ubr alliu lant. (264.18-23) Although Amor later joins the Olympian deities Venus and Cupid and is designated as their son and brother respectively, he will still function in a manner quite different from them. Whereas Venus and Cupid act in the Dido episode as external forces which can compel emotional responses, Amor represents only the personification of an already nascent state of love. For according to Veldeke's drastic alteration of the inexpressibility topos of his source, Minne remains unintelligible to anyone whose 'herze s? st?t, / daz si dar in niene g?t, ' and can be experienced only by the few who are already disposed to her pedagogic influence: 'swer ir aber rehte entsebet / unde z? ir k?ret, / vile si in des l?ret, / daz im ? was unkunt' (262.13ff.). And whereas the attributes of Venus and Cupid are limited to arrows and a torch, weapons by which they arouse desire, Amor appears to possess not only the arrows of gold and lead which cause love and hate, but also the medicine with which his wound can be cured and love requited: ein buhsen hat her an der hant, in der ander zw?ne g?re. . . . wil d? n? wizzen rehte, waz diu buhse bed?te, dazn wizzent niht aile l?te, merke in allenthalben: si bezeichent die salben, die diu Minne ie h?t gereit. diu senftet al die arbeit und machet ez allez g?t, swen diu Minne wunt t?t, daz si in geheilet. (264.24ff.) Although such descriptions of the representation of Amor have a long history, beginning with Propertius (2.12) and Ovid's Metamorphoses (4.468ff.),27 and 27 Although Ovid's description is the immediate source of the portrait in the Roman, the provenance of the boiste or buhse and its allegory has yet to be determined. Neither the Ovidian thesis of Edmand FaraL Recherches sur les sources latins des contes et romans courtois</page><page sequence="14">252 TRADITIO although the association of Amor with the resolution of the desire aroused by Venus and Cupid occurs in sources from Plautus' Curculio to the Carmina Burana, Veldeke has again made a decisive alteration of his source and its tradition. Amor's attributes, at least the buhse, have become the allegorical illustration of an internal psychological process; they represent the effects of Minne rather than the agency of an external force. The addition of Amor to the other gods of love and the differentiation between their nature and function serve as a theoretical prelude to the events which follow. In contrast to the external motivation of Dido's tragic fate, the Lavinia episode emphasizes the human genesis and resolution of love. The process begins symbolically when the paths of the lovers-to-be converge, which is expressed by a characteristic series of 'do' clauses: 'do gehabete ?n?as / en gegen des kuneges palas / ... d? was diu maget Lavine / gegangen ?f ein palas h?' (267.1ff.). This activity is then perceived by Lavinia's eyes, the most important organs ? at least initially ?in the psychological development of love: 'd? her do dare was komen, / d? gesach sie die warheit' (267.17f.). Having thus suggested Lavinia's increasing interest in and predisposition towards the ' minnes?legen Troi?n' (267.11), Veldeke then describes the actual process of falling in love with two further 'd?' clauses, the first of which recapitulates and emphasizes the convergent human activity up to this point ('d? nidene'-'d? ?f'), the second of which describes the ensuing role of Venus, whose wound now represents rather than causes the inception of desire:28 Do der h?re dare quam und s?n diu maget lussam d? nidene wart gewar und si ir ougen k?rde dar, d? si was ?f deme h?s: d? sch?z si frouwe V?n?s mit einer scharphen str?le. (267.19-25) Whereas Dido recognizes and responds immediately to the external forces which compel her actions, Lavinia's thoughts turn inward to a change which is gradually taking place within her. Her extended Liebesmonolog, itself a reflection of that change, proceeds from confusion, ' ouch enweiz ich waz mir werret' (268.13), to the hesitant identification of her emotion, the one her (Paris 1913) 144ff., nor the iconographie thesis of Julius Schwietering, ' Typologisches in mittelalterlicher Dichtung, ' Vom Werden des deutschen Geistes: Festgabe Gustav Ehrismann, edd. Paul Merker and W. Stammler (Berlin 1925) 44f., is convincing. 28 Cf. the description of Dido's love in 35.37ff., cited on 248 supra. There the 'do' clauses merely indicate the relationship between the first meeting of Dido and Eneas and the in tervention of Venus and Cupid; here they indicate a progression from Lavinia's perceptions to the allegorization of her emotions.</page><page sequence="15">HEINRICH VON VELDEKE's '?NEIT' 253 mother has called 'Minne oder swie siz hiez ? / j? si nandez Minne' (268.26f.).29 Only then is it externalized by referring to the agency of the deities of love. But in contrast to the narrator, Lavinia attributes that agency to Amor as well as to Venus, and to her torch as well as to his dart, the putative addition of which signifies the further development of her attraction: Am?r h?t mich geschozzen mit dem gold?nen g?re, des m?z ich quelen s?re und ez koufen t re. mit dem heizen f?re brennet mich frou V?n?s. (269.18-23) This discrepancy between the narrator's brief description and the detailed impressions of the heroine suggest that the relationship between the gods of love and human emotions is no longer causal, as was the case with Dido, but is analogical. In other words: Lavinia's love is not so much occasioned by external figures as it is explained or personified by them, and the constantly varying combinations of deities to which she refers ? Venus, Amor, and Cupid; Venus and Amor; or even Cupid alone ? is an indication of this situation. And since there is no clear relationship between cause and effect, the course of her monologue alternates freely between the analysis of her internal state and its description in terms of varying external figures. The responsibility for her love, for example, is attributed first to herself, 'ich w?ne daz is min scholt / . . . daz ich in [ane] sach' (270.40f.), and then to Amor, whose universal power has moved her '?ne menneschl?che scholt' (276.14). Similarly, her lengthy prayer for the cure for her affliction alternately invokes the gods of love along with Minne: Am?r unde Cupido und diu gotinne V?n?s: von ir scholden quele ich sus unde von ir wunden. Minne, ich h?n dich funden bitter albetalle. Minne, d? bist noch galle, Minne, n? wirt s?ze . . . (272.34ff.) With the resulting anthropomorphic focus of this episode, it is also not surprising that Lavinia does not feel compelled by forces beyond her control, but marvels at the wisdom which her emotional state has given her, 'wannen komet mir der sin, / daz ich sus wise worden bin, / des ich ? s? tumb was?' (271.23-25), does not beg the gods for 'genade' but realizes that the cure for love can be provided only by the ministrations of the lovers themselves: 29 On the topoi of the Liebesmonolog, see Hadumod Bussmann, 'Der Liebesmonolog im fr?hh?fischen Epos/ Werk-Typ-S?uation: zu poeto logischen Bedingungen in der ?lteren deutschen Literatur, ed. Ingeborg Glier (Stuttgart 1969) 45-63.</page><page sequence="16">254 TRADITIO der gelieben m?zen zwei wesen, diu sich underminnen unde mit ir sinnen ir willen vollebringen mit g?tlichen dingen, obs iemer r?t werden sal. (272.14-19) Shortly thereafter, Lavinia takes an active role, tutored by her own emotions, 'daz l?rde sie diu Minne' (287.7), in deciding her own fate. It is thus entirely consistent with the conception of this episode that Lavinia's arrow with its accompanying letter, not the dart of Venus, elicits the first tremor of Eneas' heart: ' den brief her dar ane vant, / . . . des im s?n herze wart al beweget' (289.28ff.). Their response to each other, a gently humorous reciprocation of bows, clearly indicates a nascent mutual 'inclination': der junkfrouwen her geneich, d? si in dem venster lach, si frowete sich d? sin gesach unde neich im hin wider von dem venster hin nider. her neich hin ?f und sie her abe. (290.6-11) Eneas' love is accordingly not caused in the traditional manner by the interven tion of Amor and Venus. As the characteristic ' do ' clauses again indicate, his own predisposed contemplation of her ' minnecl?ches antluze ' is the beginning of the process, which is then expressed by their actions:30 do markte ?neas ir ougen unde ir munt: d? sch?z in Amor s? ze stunt mit dem gold?nen g?re eine wunden s?re und V?n?s diu m?der s?n gesch?f daz im daz maged?n lieb wart als sin eigen lib. (291.10-17) The increasingly obvious parallelism in the portrayal of Lavinia and Eneas, particularly in their monologues, reinforces the impression of an attraction which, although in harmony with the design of providence, is clearly becoming mutual of its own accord. Eneas's alternating invocations of Minne and its mythological representations even carries the internalization of his emotional state to the point of reducing his mother Venus to an allegory of love: 30 Venus no longer wields an instrument, but modifies Eneas' emotions in a manner similar to that commanded by Ephesians 5.28: 'Ita et viri debent diligere uxores suas ut corpora sua. ' The shift in emphasis from external to internal motivation in the Dido and Lavinia episodes is thus paralleled by a similar demythologization from classical to Christian motifs, which is also indicated by the form of Lavinia's and Eneas' prayers.</page><page sequence="17">HEINRICH VON VELDEKE'S '?NEIT' 255 getr?stet mich, Minne, starkiu kuneginne I bist? min m?der, Minne, V?n?s, h?riu gotinne, ob ich din sun bin, Minne, des brink mich schiere inne. (295.29-34) From this scene on, the gods of love depart from the epic, leaving the couple to enact a little comedy of manners, heightened by their own self-doubts or jeal ousies and by the social restraints placed on the affirmation of their love. In the climactic judicial battle with Turnus, however, it is not supernatural assistance, but the sight of Lavinia which emboldens him to win the long promised land and its long desired queen: love, not Love, conquers all. The usual interpretation of the portrayal of love in Middle High German literature posits a development from quasi-mechanical use of external motiva tion to a more refined analysis of internal emotional states.31 Veldeke's emphasis in the Dido and Lavinia episodes on the translatio amoris from supernatural compulsion to human development suggests that both possibilities have already been fully realized by the beginning of the courtly tradition in Germany, anticipating the divergent conceptions of love in the Tristan saga and conventional Arthurian romance, and serving to explain the esteem and criticism accorded to Veldeke by such literary antagonists as Gottfried von Strassburg and Wolfram von Eschenbach. The differentiation between the deities of love and their roles in the Dido and Lavinia episodes is thus anything but a 4 kleiner Fehltritt. ' It is, of course, impossible to ascertain the extent to which Veldeke was familiar with the tradition of the 4 Two Loves, ' but if his lyric poetry can be said to have been influenced by 'gelehrte Dichtung in mittellateinischer Sprache, '32 the same may well be true of the mythographical elements in the Eneit. We must in any case be aware of the sophisticated metamorphoses of the classical tradition undertaken during the Middle Ages, and be wary of the temptation to attribute to medieval writers an ignorance which only reflects our own.33 Cornell University 31 See Ludwig Wolff, 'Die mythologischen Motive in der Liebesdarstellung des h?fischen Romans,' ZfdA 84 (1952/53) 47-70, and Bernward Plate, 'Natura Parens Amoris,' Euphorion 67 (1973) 1-23. 32 Ludwig Schneider, 'Heinrich von Veldeke: Die "Strophenpaare" MF 60, 29 + 65, 5 und MF 61, 18 + 61, 25,' Interpretationen mittelhochdeutscher Lyrik, ed.
