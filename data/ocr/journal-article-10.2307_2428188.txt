<plain_text><page sequence="1">School Botany. By MACGREGOR SKENE. 2nd edition. Oxford Uni- versity Press, I934. 7j in. x 5 in. Pp. vi + 278. Price 3S. 6d. The early call for a new edition of this successful little book has enabled it to be extended and improved in detail, and one may sincerely hope with the author that its usefulness may thus be still further increased. It professes to cover the field of matriculation botany, introducing its readers to the structure and activities of plants mainly in terms of the angiosperm. In the new edition a chapter on other kinds of plants has been added and deals very briefly with conifers, ferns, mosses, algae, fungi and lichens. Although the bulk of the book deals with its matter in a fairly orthodox manner, there is a certain freshness of treatment that makes it agreeable reading even to those who have read elementary botany books before. This will probably not surprise readers who are already familiar with Dr Skene's earlier publica- tions. Most botanical handbooks tell you that photosynthesis was discovered by Joseph Priestley with the help of a mouse, a sprig of mint and a bell jar. Not many tell you that Priestley's thoughts were set to work in this direction by an entirely false clue given him by the landlord of an inn at Harwich. (Incidently not even Dr Skene tells you of the difficulty Priestley had in repeating his famous experiment.) In this special example it may perhaps be thought that the author goes rather far. Is it wise to point out to the learner at such an early stage the undeniable fact that many of the most fruitful discoveries have been arrived at more by lucky chance than by unimpeachable reasoning? At least it may be pleaded that this cruel " debunking" should not be extended to living workers. Among much that is excellent and stimulating one major point of treatment seems curiously outmoded. Thus, on p. I05, "Plants often store up food for future use"; on p. 93, " Here is a new kind of leaf, very different in form from a foliage leaf, and doing quite diffeient work"; there are also numerous chapter headings such as " The Flower and its Work." It may be argued, of course, that these phrases are literally correct, nevertheless we do not usually say that a mixed solution of salt and silver nitrate stores silver chloride; nor that iron and nickel do different work because their properties are not the same. The fact is that these words are liable to be misunderstood and never more than when describing plants to the human young. Rightly handled, a biological training may be the best specific against anthropomorphism, but there are obvious pitfalls. The illustrations by Miss Ruth Weston are line drawings that for the most part can safely be shown to pupils as examples of what should be attempted, but we devoutly hope that none will adopt the method of flower drawing</page><page sequence="2">324 Reviews applied to the buttercup and rose in Figs. 36 and 52. Surely it is time that this venerable error was interred. The opposite extreme in Figs. 38 and 39 (poplar and plantain) is not really much more informative, but a happy inconsistency has led to better results with the daffodil, primrose and some others. A feature of this reissue that catches the eye is the abandonment by the publishers of their familiar blue and gold cover in which the first edition ap- peared and its substitution by a pleasant green ornamented with a leaf of A conitum napellus.
