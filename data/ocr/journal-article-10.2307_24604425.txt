<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANCESTOR WORSHIP IN BAHIA : THE ÉGUN-CULT by Juana Elbein DOS SANTOS and Deoscoredes M. DOS SANTOS Historical background Brazil is the meeting place of three continents — Africa, Europe, and America. It is well known that during the colonial period of Brazil's his tory, negro cultures were introduced as a result of the slave-trade from the west coast of Africa. The Nàgô1 constitute the " nations " of West Africa which made the greatest cultural impression on Bahia. Classified by modern ethnology as Yorùbâ, the Nàgô were the carriers of a tradition whose richness was derived from the individual cultures of the different kingdoms of which they were born. This was especially the case of those peoples from Kétu, Qyç, fcgbädo, and Ègbâ. The Nàgô brought to Brazil their traditions and their customs, their hierarchical structures, both secular and religious, their concepts, both philosophical and esthetic, their language, music, oral literature and mythology. Above all else, they brought to Brazil their religion. Bahia, situated on the Atlantic sea-board of Brazil, experienced the greatest cultural concentration of the Nàgô. Together with the well-organized cult-houses, where to the present day are preserved the temples and shrines 1. The Yorùbd words and texts in this paper are written in accordance with the inter nationally accepted convention used by specialized institutes in Nigeria. One of the aims of the authors are to write down and translate Nàgô words, texts, and chants from Bahia. Modern orthography has been adopted in order to rescue the rich oral tradition preserved and transmitted from generation to generation in the Nàgô cult houses. Cor rect spelling and translation of words and texts constitute extremely valuable evidence and sources for Afro-Brazilian studies.</page><page sequence="2">80 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES of the Ôrisà2, the Nàgô practiced elaborate funeral rites. Even today they continue to worship not only their family ancestors but also the great figures who founded the cults in Bahia. The latter, known by the name of Èsà, are the first collective ancestors of the Afro-Brazilians. They are worshipped during the Pade or Ipade 3, a propitiatory ceremony, and are " assentados " 4, along with other illustrious dead of the sect in a special house. We shall be returning to this later, but suffice it to say that this house is called Ilé-ibo-aku, and is set aside from the other temples in which the Orisà are worshipped. Ancestors who were worshipped in Yorùbâ territory 5 are also the object of veneration in Brazil. These ancestors represent family lineages, ruling dynasties, protectors of certain cities and regions, and with special func tions, different aspects of death. Those ancestors who take on bodily forms constitute the Egun or Egüngün. It was around these Égun who had their origins in Africa and were brought to Brazil, that there were formed cult-groups, which had as their counter parts in West Africa the Egüngün cult. The very fact of the existence and perfect preservation of ancestor worship in Bahia, as evidenced by the presence of organized Egun terreiros (cult-areas), permits two important deductions to be made : A. Certainty as to the geographical and cultural origin of some nations which were represented in Bahia. It is well known that the Egüngün cult is especially strong among the Yorùbâ 6 of those regions inhabited by the Èyç, the Ègbâ and the Ègbâdô. In view of the fact that the worship of the Ôrisà Sàngô is one of the most widespread in Bahia, especially that of Sàngô Àfçnjâ of the royal house of Qyç, it would seem appropriate to compare these facts with the statement made by Abraham, " the worship of Egüngün and Sàngô is especially widespread in Qyç " 7. Mr. Olajubu 8 refers to the fact that all the lithurgical texts both in the poetry and the chants, related to the Egüngün, made frequent references to a home-land, a sort of country from where the Egüngün descend. In this connection he mentions places such as Ôgbôn, Ogbojô, Iresà, Igôri, Ofâ, and their respective chiefs. In Bahia, Olôgbojô is one of the best known and 2. Divine entities of the Yoriibd Pantheon. 3. Propitiatory parcel for the use of the deceased in the next world that should be car ried and left in the open air. 4. The act of consecrating a place of worship. 5. The Yorùbà inhabit an extensive region that covers the south-west of Nigeria, parts of southern and central Dahomey, central Togo. There are a few Yorùbd settlements also in Ghana and there have been large migrations to Sierra Leone. 6. Relatively recently modern ethnology has grouped under the word Yorùbd diverse clans and tribes all of them speaking a similar language. 7.

He adds that a classification of the origin of the texts can be made, not merely based on content alone, but by means of the actual technique of recitation used and, of course, local linguistic expres sions within the overall dialected norm. He states : " Iwi9 is recited in the central Yorùbâ language or in the dialect of the Qyç speaking peoples for the Egungûn texts and chants It is not easy to understand these chant not only because of their symbolic content, frequent reference to unknown names, or names which have already disappeared, but also because of the excessive use of archaism and elision. Thus, the Egungûn cult pro vides clear evidence of the strong legacy bequeathed by the Yorùbâ to Bahia. B. Our second deduction is derived from the published studies of various authors on the Yorùbâ concept of death10. In general their conclusions are equally applicable to the Yorùbâ descendants in Bahia. Although the funeral rites constitute one important aspect (as yet not studied in depth) of the Egungûn activities, the specific object of the present study is limited to throwing light on details of the Egûngûn cult in Bahia. Already B. Bastide 11 has pointed out the necessity for specialized mono graphs and those factors which should " have induced ethnographers to take a greater interest in the Egûngûn There can be no doubt that the available bibliography 12 in addition to being thin, is also grossly incom plete.

Despite the serious approach adopted by this pioneer in Afro-Brazilian studies towards the worship of the Ôrisà, he lacked the basic knowledge and insight to describe, or even to refer seriously to the Egûngûn (" a grotesque appearance of the soul of a dead person in the funeral rites ") which at the time of his writing existed and were fully organized. However, oral tradition allows us to ascribe the presence of the Egüngün in Bahia to a much earlier date than 1896. There is evidence of the origin of various " terreiros " founded by Afri cans in the first third of the l9th century. These are as follows : Terreiro de Veracruz : This was situated in the village of Veracruz, the oldest parish of the Island of Itaparica in the Bay of All Saints. It was dedicated to the cult of the Egüngün. An African, known by the name of Tio Serafim, renowned for his knowledge and power, was its founder and chief. He, together with one of his sons and numerous followers invo ked the ancestors. He had brought with him from Africa and was able to make appear the Egun of his own father, who had died on the coast of Africa. This Égun was, and is, called Égun Okulele. Tio Serafim died over one hundred years of age, sometime between 1905 and 1910, having founded the cult-house as a young man. Terreiro de Mocambo : This cult-house was also on the Island of Itaparica on the estate called Mocambo, where there were a large number of African slaves. Its chief was the African Marcos Pimentel, known as Marcos-the Old, in order to differentiate him from his son of the same name who, conti Pierre Verger : Notes sur le culte des Orisa et Vodun, Mémoires de l'Institut français d'Afri que Noire, n° 51-Ifan-Dakar, 1957. — Grandeur et Décadence du Culte de Iyami Osoronga, Société des Africanistes, 1966.

Marcos-the-Old bought himself out of boundage, and together with his son returned to Africa where he remained many years. During his stay in Africa, Marcos-the-Old continued to perfect his ritual knowledge, and his son Marcos was initiated into all the secrets of the cult, gaining a profound knowledge from original sources. When both returned to Bahia they brought with them the " assento " 14 of the Égun Olûkçtûn, considered one of the ancestors of the true Yorùbâ race. Thus they founded the Terreiro do Tuntum (see below). Because of his powers Marcos-the-Old was very feared. According to popular tradition he was sentenced to death by a group of other old pro minent Africans because his practices had resulted in the death of a person. Marcos-the-Old died seven days later on the beach 15. All the necessary preceptual rites, and " obrigaçôes " 16 were performed and his spirit was invoked as an Égun. He is still worshipped with the name of Baba Sôadè. Terreiro de Tuntum : This was also situated on the Island of Itaparica in the old settlement of the Africans called Tuntum, the cradle of many who were later to gain prominence in the African sects. Marcos Teodoro Pimen tel, the son of Marcos-the-Old, was its chief. Together with his sons and numerous faithful Africans and crioules he founded the cult-house Ilé-Olu kçtûn whose name was derived from the patron of the terreiro. The ances tors invoked and worshipped at the cult-house of Tuntum were many. Many of the names of the priests who were members of the cult at the Ilé-Olûkptûn are well known. Some are still alive, and many of the descendants conti nue to play an active role in the sect. The Terreiro de Tuntum disappeared with the death of Tio Marcos Teodoro Pimentel in about 1935. As he died almost a centenarian, it can be deduced that the Terreiro de Mocambo headed by Marcos-the-Old, must have existed about 1830. A nephew of Marcos Teodoro, Arsenio Ferreira dos Santos, continued the family tradition and played an active role in other Égun cult-houses. Later he himself founded his own Égun cult-house in the district of Vila America in the city of Salvador. Terreiro da Encarnaçâo : This was situated in the settlement of Encar naçâo, on the main-land part of the Municipality of Itaparica, to which it belonged at that time. Information as to the identity of the founder is 14. Literally, seat, foundation, support, statute. It is the consecrated place where the Égun is worshipped and receives sacrifices. 15.

The first chief about whom information is available was a son of Tio Serafim (the founder of the Terreiro de Veracruz). He was called Joäo Deis-Metros because of his extraordinary height. It was at this cult-house that there was invoked for the first time in Brazil the Égun known as Baba Agbôulâ, one of the patriarchs of the Yorùbâ race. Among the priests who were members of this cult-house, one of the most prominent was Qjè Gregorio 17. His nephew, even today as an old man, continues to worship Égun Baba Agbôulâ, who had been the patron of the Terreiro da Encarnaçâo. Terreiro do Corta-Braço : This was situated on the Estrada das Boiadas, a suburb of the City of Salvador in the present district of Liberdade. Almost all its members were Africans and its chief was Tio Opè. An Qjè of this cult-house, the African Joäo-Boa-Fama18, was notorious in Bahia. He initiated some people from the Island of Itaparica and other young people, who many years later, together with the descendants of Tio Marcos and Tio Serafim, were to found the Terreiro Ilé-Agbôulâ which still exists in Ponta de Areia. In addition to the above, other " terreiros " known to exist at the end of the 19th century were the following : One situated in Quitandinha do Capim, renowned for its annual festivals at which were invoked Égun Olii Apçlç and Olçjà-Qrun ; the cult-house of Tio Agostinho in Matatu, a meeting place for the most famous Qjè of the period including Tio Marcos and his Ojç ; the Terreiro da Preguiça at the side of the Church of the Conceiçâo da Praia, among whose membership were many Africans ; and finally, there are references to the invocation of Egûngûn at Agua de Meninos, but it is uncertain if a cult-house was established there. In connection with the old Égun cult-houses, special reference must be made to Martiliano Eliseu do Bomfin, one of the leading coloured people of Bahia at the beginning of this century. His father Tio Eliseo was an Afri can of Kétu origin, who had brought to Bahia at the beginning of the 19th century the Egun îlàri, the patriarch of his family. While still a boy, Martiliano was sent by his father to Nigeria where he lived many years, gaining deeper knowledge of the cults and learning several languages. After his return to Bahia, he became the strongest advocate for the preservation of the Yorùbâ traditions in Bahia. He continued the ancestors' cult and took part in numerous " Egûngûn terreiros and initiated some people into the secrets of the cult. All these cult-houses were in existence approximately between 1820 and 1935 and functioned regularly according to their lithurgical calendars with well defined hierarchies and rituals. The Qjç, priests of the Egûngûn cult, 17. Priest of the Égun-cult (see below). 18. Joäo Boa-Fama became a legend of popular tradition. Many stories are told about him and one in D.

Both the names and the activities of many of these Qjç are well known. Their direct descendants, and others whom they initiated in the old cult-houses continued to practice the rituals of the cult, and preserved to the present day two cult-houses of the Egungûn which are the only existing in Brazil. The Ilé-Agbôulà on the island of Itaparica was founded during the first quarter of this century and can be traced in a direct line from the old " ter reiros ". The Ilé-Oya is much more recent and is merely a branch of the former. These cult-houses of the Egungûn inherited from the old " terreiros " not only the lithurgy, and the doctrine, not only the knowledge of the mystery and the secrets of the cult, but also the ancestral Égun who had been on, and worshipped on the old " terreiros ". With the passage of time, these Egun of African origin were joined by those Egun of various Ojè who had died in Bahia and during whose lifetimes had been sufficiently eminent to merit the honour of being the immortal guardians of the Nàgô culture. THE EGÜNGÜN CULT The Nàgô believe in the immortality of spirits and worship their ances tors. This worship takes different forms, beginning with elaborate funeral rites which, according to the hierarchy of the dead person and the verdict of Ifâ, the ritual oracle, determine the course to be followed by the respec tive spirits. All the spirits of dead people are called Ardçrun, in other words, the inhabitants of the çrun19. In Yorubaland they are also called àwon-arâ-ilé, the inhabitants of earth. The spirits of those dead males specially prepared so that their bodily forms can be invoked in determined circumstances and by means of well defined rituals, receive the name of Égun, Egûngûn, Baba Égun or simply Baba. The prime object of the Egûngûn cult is to make the ancestral spirits visible, to handle the power which emanates from them, and to act as a vehicle between the living and the dead. While upholding the continuity between life and death, the Egûngûn cult also maintains strict control over the relationship between the living and the dead, distinguishing comple tely between both — the world of the living and that of the dead. In fact, the Baba bring to their descendants and followers the benefits of the bles sing and advice, but they cannot be touched and always remain isolated from the living. Their presence is rigourously controlled by the Qjç and nobody can approach the Egûngûn. 19. An abstract conception of something infinite, very distant and large.</page><page sequence="8">86 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES The Egüngün appear in characteristic form, totally covered by coloured cloths, permitting the onlookers to vaguely perceive human forms of diffe rent heights and sizes. It is believed that under the strips of cloth which cover the bodily forms is the Égun of a dead person, a known ancestor, or, in the event that the bodily form is not recognizable, some aspect related to death. In the latter case the Egüngün represent collective ancestors who symbolize moral concepts and are the guardians of inherited customs and traditions. These collective ancestors are the most respected and fea red of all the Egüngün, keepers as they are of the ethics and moral discipline of the group. A supernatural and mysterious power emanates from the Egüngün. This mystery, awo, is the most important aspect of the Egüngün cult. A chant directly associated with this aspect states : 1. Gégé orô aso la ri, 2. La ri, la ri, 3. Gégé orô aso Içmon, 4. A ko mç&gt; Baba. In accordance with the rites cloth (are what) we see, (That which) we see, (that which) we see, In accordance with the rites pieces of cloth (are what) we see, We do not know, father. This text is fundamental to the understanding of the basic concepts of the Egüngün cult. It is directly associated with the mystery of death, awo, and indicates that death or the elements which are extensions of him (in Yorùbâ death is a masculine substantive) ,are not, nor can be known. As secrecy of the Egüngün demand, it is not known, nor should one seek to know, what is hidden under the strips of cloth. As has already been stated, only the masculine ancestors can be immortal ized through the Egüngün. Similarly, the priests who deal with the Egün gün are male. Women are completely excluded from all activities related to the Egüngün. Formely, in Yorubaland, one of the functions of the Egüngün groups, was the so called " hunting out the Àjé The Àjé, also known by the name of lya-mi (lit. our mothers) or Iyâ-àgbà (lit. the aged and venerated mothers)20, are generally aged women capable of possessing extraordinary powers. While the Àjé represent the collective image of maternity, fertility, fecundity, and the quintessence of life, they also repre sent the persecuting, dominating and aggressive image of that self-same feminine power. The strong matriarchial remnants of Yorùbâ society are balanced by the masculine activity of the Egüngün. In the distant past, the Egüngün society also had the purpose of discovering and punishing or banning those old women who used their power in a destructive manner. It is readily apparent that since the function of the Egüngün is to guarantee 20.

The struggle between the sexes for supremacy is a constant factor in all Yorùbâ myths and lithurgical texts. The working out of the balance between these two poles is accomplished by institutions, whose latent and manifest contents, permit such an elabora tion. In the same way as the masculine ancestors have their institution in the Egüngün 21, so have the Iyä-mi their female counterparts, their own institution in the Gçlçdç society 22. According to certain myth Odùa is the deified representation of the Iyâ mi, the ancestral mother, and the feminine principle from which every thing originates. Thus Odùa corresponds to Obàtâlà or Ôrisàlâ who is the masculine principle and god of creation. These concepts and divine beings are represented symbolically by a calabash which represents the universe, the lower half being Odùa and the upper half, being Obàtâlà. It is pre cisely these deities, the feminine and masculine principles respectively, which appear in all sacred texts where there are references to the Égun. According to these texts, masculine imposition wasn't easily achieved. The man seized supremacy from woman by dint of much patience, no little cunning, and even by violence. Despite the fact that Obàtâlà was the first man to cover himself with the cloths of the Egüngün, he only, the consort of Odùa, was sent her bird to control the power which he had acqui red from her 23. Thus the two principles found their balance. Although the women are totally excluded both from the possibility of being immorta lized by an Egûngùn and from the secret activities of the sect, they hold some titles and functions within the cult-group. They are keen participants in all cult ceremonies as they offer sacrifices and are allowed, above all, to sing chants characteristic of the Egüngün during the annual festivities. In the same way as the Ç)jè have a formal greeting, which is characteristic of the sect, so have the women who hold titles their one special manner of greeting. QYA-ÎGBÀLfc The power of the bird of the Iyâ-mi controll the ancestors. Thus it is no wonder that a female Ôrisâ, Oya-Îgbàlç, is the queen and mother of the 21. Peter Morton Williams goes to great length to explain the ambivalent relation between both sexes in his article " Yoruba Responses to the Fear of Death op. cit. 22. U.

In Bahia also, Oya-Îgbàlç is worshipped along side the Egüngün. It is she who commands the world of the dead. Various myths have clari fied the relationship of the Baba-Égun with Oya, a shortened version of Oya-Igbàlç. Egüngün was the ninth son of Oya 24. " The myth relates that Oya was the wife of Ögün and could not have children. She consulted a BabaV awo who revealed that she could only have sons with a man who possessed her violently. So it was that Sàngô took her. Oya had nine sons by him. The first eight were born dumb. Again Oya went and consulted the BabaV awo who told her to make sacrifices. The result was the birth of Egüngün or Egun, who was not dumb, but could only speak with a voice which was not human. " This refers to the unique manner in which the Egun speak, a subject to which we shall return later. One of her oriki2S, also names her îyâ-mésàn-çrun, Mother-of-the-nine çrun, the nine sons desented in the myth. Onin is an abstract concept of an infinite, wide and distant place, inhabited by the Arà-çrun, the ances tral spirits. Of equal importance is the relationship which the myth establishes bet ween Sàngô and the Égun. It has already been stated (p. 82) that the cults of Sàngô and Egüngün originated from the same region, 0yQ, the land of the Yorùbâ proper. The relationship between Sàngô and Egun is of vital importance but is beyond the scope of the present work. Another myth, whose text forms part of the Odù-Èji-Ologbon, narrates how the secret society of the Egüngün was created. Histories handed down from father to son narrate that the secret-society of the Egun, the worship of the spirits of the ancestors, was created according to the following legend : " In the beginning of the world, the woman intimidated the man of that time and twisted them around their little fingers. For this reason Oya (more commonly known in the Afro-Brazilian cults as Iyâsan) was the first to invent the secret or masonery of the Egüngün in every aspect. Thus, when the women wanted to abase their husbands, they met at a cross-road with Iyâsan in the van. Iyâsan was already there with a big monkey which she had trained. This monkey had been dressed with clothes especially designed for that purpose. The monkey was at the foot of the trunk of an igi (tree) and would perform as was determined by Iyâsan by means of a switch which she had in her hand. The switch is known as the isân. After a special ceremony the monkey appeared performing its skills, as dictated by Iyâsan. This was done in full sight of the men who ran away terrified by that apparition. Finally, one day the men decided to take measures 24. Juana Elbein e Deoscoredes M. dos Santos, versäo mimiografaca, op. cit., p. 38. 25.

It defines qualities or particular facts of lineages, gods and divinities.</page><page sequence="11">ANCESTOR WORSHIP IN BAHIA : THE ÉGUN-CULT 89 to put an end to the continued shame of living under the thumb of the women as they were doing. So they decided to go to the house of Orûmilà (god of the oracle Ifâ) to consult Ifâ in order to know what they could do to remedy that situation. After consultation Orûmilà explained to them all what was happening, and what steps they should take. Then he sent Ogûn to make an offering, ebo, of roosters, a gown, a sword and a used hat, at the cross-roads at the foot of the afore-mentioned tree, before the women met together. No soo ner said, than done. Ogûn arrived very early at the cross-roads and did with the roosters as ordered by Orûmilà. Afterwards he put on the gown, put on the hat, and took the sword in his hand. Later on the same day, when all the women had arrived and congregated to celebrate the usual rites, suddenly, at a certain moment, there appeared before them a terrifying form. So terrifying was this apparition that the leader of the women, Iydsan herself was the first to flee. Due to the strength and power which she possessed she disappeared from the face of the earth forever. Thus, from that time forth the men have domesticated the women and are the absolute masters of the cult. They forbad and still forbid any woman to penetrate the secret of any type of masonic-society. But as the saying goes, " it is the exception which makes the rule ". Thus those very rare cases in which previously women had been allowed to participate in Yorûbâ territory, continued and exist under exceptional circumstances. This explains the reason why Iydsan — Oya — is worshipped and venerated by everybody as the Queen and Founder of the secret society of the Egûn gûn on Earth " 26. This myth also underlines the priority of feminine power. In Bahia on the Terreiro of Égun, Oya-îgbàlè is worshipped in a special " assento ", a place usually reserved for the celebration of the private rites for Égun. She receives offerings on pre-determined occasions and is wor shipped in the chants and greetings. Her oriki is sang whenever there are celebrations of great importance. The Qjè hold her in great awe. Adé-Îgbàlè, the crown of the îgbàlç thus Queen of the îgbàlç, is one of the names by which she is known.

In line two (2) we are infor med that Oya-Îgbàlç is mistress of the Qpâkôko, crook or trunk of the Akàko tree, rammed into the earth, being the place of the " assento " of the ances tors 27. Line three (3) informs us that Oya-îgbàlç is the mistress of the high places. This reference is made to the manner in which she controls the wind which blows over the roofs, thereby expressing the agressive side of her nature. This aspect of Oya is complemented by the following saying : a) Aféfé Ikü Wind of Death. b) Efùfùlçlç ti'dâ gi l'okè l'okè The rushing of the wind which smashes down trees from the top. Line four (4) informs us that Oya is the mistress of the strips of cloth, symbolic expression of the characteristic clothes of the Baba-Égun. ONIlB, ÈSÙ AND 0SÂNYÎN It has already been stated that the Arâ-çrun are also called in Africa Àwon-arâ-ilé, inhabitants of the earth. They are worshipped collectively in a special place, a small mound of earth, in the open air, with a branch of a tree stuck into the top of the mound which has been specially prepared for that purpose. This place is called Onilç, the masters of the earth. Onilç, is considered to be a god and is worshipped as such, by the Elegûngun (priests of the Egûngun), since Onilç is the collective representative of the ances tors. He must always be the first to be worshipped and the very first to receive the offerings. He is also the first to be invoked. Both in Bahia and in West Africa the rites of the Égun begin by paying him homage : 1. Onilç ibà re Onilç, Thou are venerated 2. Onilç mo jûbà Onîlç, I present to thee my humble respects. The ancestors receive also the name of Imolç and are worshipped at the foot of Onilç. For this reason it is said that Onilç is always accompanied by the Imolç. He is held as the god of justice. Oaths are sworn and agreements are made in his name. His pronounce ments are accepted without appeal. It is believed that Imolç is extremely severe in the punishments he metes out to those who do not fulfill the pro mises made in his name. Finally Èsù and 0sânyin are two entities who are also worshipped by the Elegûngûn. Èsù is ubiquitious. He moves both in the world of the living and of the dead. The myths attribute to him the role of inspector general and reports on the way in which the sacrifices and rites are conducted. He 27. See description below, Opdkdko.</page><page sequence="13">ANCESTOR WORSHIP IN BAHIA : THE ÉGUN-CULT 91 is the carrier of all requests and supervises and informs Olçrun (the supreme god) about all the offerings. A detailed analysis of Èsù permits a compari son to be made between his characteristics and those of the ancestors. He also represents the power of the ancestors and embodies one of their most important aspects — the continuity of life. This latter aspect makes Èsù, like the ancestors, a propitiatory entity and together with Onilç and Imolç he has priority on invocations and sacrifices. He is " assentado " in the open air protecting the entries to houses, small holdings and villages. Or he can have his " assentos " inside the houses prepared with composite mixtures which sometimes may take on a peculiar anthropomorphic form. Because of his propitiatory qualities, Èsù receives together with the Arâç run and the Égun the first fruits, befitting not only fertility but also sexual potency. He is often represented with an enormous phallus ; on other occasions he is represented with a characteristic head-dress, a phallic trans ference. This same phallic transference is apparent in his most important attribute — his Ogo. The Ogo is a short thick club with a sort of knot or head at one end. This characteristic attribute of Èsù, the subject of many myths, is only used by Èsù and by some Égun. The Pade is a name of a special rite during which a propitiatory parcel (called in Yoruba ipade) is carried out to invoke all the male and female ancestors, together with Èsu and all other kind of spirits, so that they will come to receive the offerings of the load (each of whose component parts is highly symbolical and directed at satisfying the invoked entities and there by to obtain from them the desired benefits) and will not interfere in the ceremonies to be realized. This rite is performed on those " terreiros " where the Ôrisà are worship ped. Great care is taken so that during the invocation of the Ôrisà there is no interference by non-deified beings. In the Ôrisà cult-houses also, before the beginning of the Àsèsè, funeral rites, the Pade is performed in order to propitiate, and above all to permit without interference, the com pletion of the ritual of the " assentamento " of the new spirit. On the contrary, on the " terreiro " of the Egun where the ancestors are invoked, the dispatching of the Pade is not necessary. In fact, the cere mony of the Pade which is so vitaly important in the cult-houses of the Ôrisà, does not constitute part of the lithurgy of the Égun-cult. This essential difference between the Ôrisà and the Égun is well brought in the words of a chant sung in Africa during the Egûngun festivals : 1. Egûngun Va lise We are worshipping Egüngün 2. Àwa o s'àôsà We are not worshipping the Ôrisà 3. K'alâso funfun Those dressed in white clothes (wor shippers of Ôrisà) 4. Kùrà Vagbo wa Must stay away from our circle. It has already been said that Èsù moves both in the world of the living and of the dead. He is the intermediary and messenger both for the Ôrisà</page><page sequence="14">92 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES and for the ancestors. Thus he is worshipped, with due precautions, be it lésé Orisà or lésç Égun 28. The Egüngün performs all the functions of a Babalâwo, priest versed in the technique, understanding and interpretation of the Ifâ oracle. The Babalâwo reads the message transmitted by the positions of the cowrie shells or of the çpçlè 29. The Egüngün is the direct voice of the ancestor. His word is sacrosanct. He replays to all who come to consult him, giving advice, settling legal questions, ordering sacrifices to be made, prescribing rites to be performed and different types of purification. In the majority of the prescriptions the use of leaves is indispensable. Just as leaves are indispensable in all the rites of initiation into the cult. Since Qsânyin is the owner of all the leaves, the patron of medicine, his participation in the " terreiro " of Égun is essential. In summary it may be said that in the .Egura-cult-house not only are the Égun themselves worshipped, but also Ontlè, Imolç, Oya-Î gbàlè, Èsù and Qsânyin. THE EGÜNGÜN CULT-HOUSE Every Egüngün terreiro must have an Onilç, a mound of earth in the open air, generally situated very close to the Ilé-awo, the house of the secret, were are the other " assentos " of the cult. This house may only be used by the initiated and is near to the "barracâo" (permanent pavilion for the public ceremonies). The Ilé-awo contains the Lésànyin or îgbàlè. The geographical area of the " terreiro " of the Egüngün-cult can be separated into three units each with its specific function : A. Those places frequented without restrictions by all the followers of the cult and participants at the public ceremonies. This unit is consti tuted by a part of the " barracâo ", the open-space both in front and at the sides of the " barracâo " and the space in front of the Onile. B. Those places to which the Egüngün come to participate in the festi vals and which can only be frequented by initiates or people accompanied by initiates. It is in these places that the Baba receive offerings, fulfill some of their prescribed rites, dance, sing, give blessings and deliver messages. This unit comprises another part of the " barracâo " and the open space between the Onilç and the Ilé-awo. In that part of the " barracâo strictly reserved for the appearance of the Égun, is the throne and chairs which the Baba use during the public ceremonies. This unit also includes the anteroom of the Ilé-awo, where the Qjç meet with the other initiates. Here it is that the first rites of initiation take 28. Sustainers of the Orisà, sustainers of the Égun ; in the cult of the Orisà, in the cult of the Égun. 29. Divining-chain of Ifd, god of the oracle of prophecy. This chain is comprised of 8 palm-seeds, having a concave and a convex side each.</page><page sequence="15">ANCESTOR WORSHIP IN BAHIA : THE ÉGUN-CULT 93 place. It is the social-room of the Qjç. This place is closed to non-ini tiates. In this anteroom is the " assento " of Èsù since it has to be at the entrance door of the IU-awo. Near to this assento is that of Qsânyin. C. The third unit is the Lésànyin or Igbàlè. This can only be frequented by the senior Ojç versed in all the secrets of the cult and who therefore are fully conditioned to be able to deal with those situations directly related to the mystery of the sect. Here it is that the ancient Égun, Égun-Àgbà, are " assentados were the new Egun are prepared, and where all the Égun are invoked. The îgbàlè, which in Africa were a glade in the secret forest, in Bahia is an isolated building in which are performed the private and secret rites of the cult. All the decisions of the sect are taken at the Igbàlè. Only the most senior Qjç may enter it. In Bahia the îgbàlç, more commonly pronounced Bàlç, is also called Lésànyin : lié + ésàn + yin, the house of worship of lyâ-mèsàn-çrun, or the house of worship of Mésàn-çrun, in other words, the worship of the children of Oya, the Arà-çrun and the Egun. On no account must the Ilé-ibo-akû, the house of worship of the dead lésç Orisà, be confused with the Lésànyin, the house of worship of the Égun lésç Égun. In the Ilé-ibo the spirits of the Adôsù, priestesses initiated in the cult of the Orisà, are worshipped. In the Lésànyin the Arà-çrun in general and the spirits of those initiated into the mystery of the Égun are worshipped. Qtç ni Égun, çtç ni Orisà This phrase repeated by Baba-Égun in various occasions means that the Egun are totally different from the Orisà. Similarly the funeral rites and the " assentamento " of the dead people are different in the two cults 30. The attendance of the Égun at different funeral ceremonies held on " ter reiros " of Ôrisà is due to exceptional circumstances. In such cases the invocation and appearance of the Égun occurs in places separate and exclu sively prepared for such functions. Conversely, on the " terreiro " of Égun there may be a house or place of worship dedicated to the Orisà. Such a place is totally independent of those houses dedicated to the worship of the Egungün. During the of a senior priestess of the Ôrisà, on the night of the 6th to the 7th day of the funeral ceremony, when the spirit of the dead priestess is invoked, the spirit may appear accompanied by certain senior Égun, protectors of the " terreiro ancestor of certain family-lineages. 30. It should be noticed that the assento registered by René Ribeiro in Recife at the (Ig)Bàlè are correct and are not substitutes of the « assentos " at the Ilé-ibo (confused with the Lésànyin, " Ile-Saim " as spelt by Bastide) which are very different. Roger Bastide, op. cit., Footnote on page 88. René Ribeiro, op. cit., page 40.</page><page sequence="16">94 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES These Egûngun escort the new spirit, communicate its last orders and will be responsible for taking it and separating it from the egbe, the community of the cult. Two ceremonies of these type occurred at the terreiro Àse Opô Afonjâ, on the occasion of the funeral ceremonies of the famous Iyâlàrisà Mâe Aninha, Oba Biiyii, and Aide Senhora, Qsun Muiwâ, the Îyâ-Nàsô of the above mentioned Ase 81. In the Lésànyin are the places of worship of the venerated entities. There too are kept the sacred objects essential for the invocation of the Egun. The Igbàlç contains the Qpâ-Koko : Qpâ + Akoko, a preceptual staff made from a thick branch of the Aköko tree, or in the absence of this, from any other sacred tree. The staff is stuck into the earth. The Akoko tree is one of those trees worshipped in Yorubaland. The Dictionary of the Oxford University Press notes, " its leaf is placed on the head of a new king or chief as annointement. The tree is so sacred that it is never used for fire or tou ched with an axe... " 32. Abraham also says : " it is commonly seen around (the) igbô-igbàlè " 33. In fact, the cult of trees is one of the oldest cults in Yorubaland. Thus many myths begin with the phrase, " in an age when man adored trees... " Elégbé bogi is the oriki used for tree-worshippers. Some of these sacred trees are used for different ritual purposes. In certain cults and in funeral ceremonies, tree-trunks are used as substitutes for the dead. Branches are found in places where the ancestors are worshipped. We also find in such places slender switches called isan. In the hands of the Qjç these serve to invoke the ancestors. In Africa, in front of the big temples, is a spe cial spot where the ancestors are worshipped : here stands the Qpâ which represents them collectively. The Qpâ, branches, staffs or ritual sceptres, are of vital importance in the Egûngun cult. A chant sung by the Egûngun in Bahia, allows us to infer the importance attributed to the Qpâ : Olçrun Olçrun Olççpâ Olorun Olçrun, the supreme god is the master of the Opâ. It is as if Olçrun has delegated part of his own power to the Qpâ. Also in the Lésànyin, but completely independent of the Qpâkàkô, the collective representation of the ancestors, are the individual " assentos " of some Égun-àgbà. These are clay pots, with special shapes having very wide 31. José de Lima, op. cit., describes one of the funeral rites, " obrigaçôes ", of the Iyàlôrisà Mäe Aninha. We should insist that this description does not refer to an Égun Festival, but to an extraordinary " obrigaçâo " at an Orisà cult-house at which the Egun appeared executing one of his functions during funeral rites for an Adôsù. 32. A Dictionary of the Yoruba Language, Oxford University Press, London, second edition, 1950, London, p. 27. 33. R. C. Abraham, op. cit., p. 44.</page><page sequence="17">ANCESTOR WORSHIP IN BAHIA : THE ÉGUN-CULT 95 mouths. These pots contain a solid mixture made up of ritual elements. Such " assentos " are completely different from the " assentos " of the Ilé-ibo lésé Orisà. The pots of the "assentos" of the Égun are laid on a low bench of earth, called pèpéle. In front of the Opdkôko and the individual " assentos " are very small holes called ojübo. In these holes are placed and sprinkled at the beginning of the ceremony, a little of each offering. It is precisely in the îgbàlç that the Qje invoke the Egûngûn. For this purpose they use the isan, or ritual switch ; grasping this firmly in their right hands, the Qjç strike the earth three times, at the same moment as they pronounce the secret formulas. At the third such invocation the Égun should reply. Since inhabitants of the earth, then it will be precisely from the earth that the Egûngûn should surge forth. The isan is a stick about 1.60 mts. long. It may be made from branches from the Atôri (Glyphaea Lateriflora) 34, a tree specially noted for its hard ness, or from the mid-rib of the fronds of the Igi-Qpe (Elacis Guineensis) 35, oil-palm. The Isan is an Qpâ which has been ritually prepared and is the only means by which an Égun can be controlled and kept at a distance. Since the isan represents the ancestors and is of their same nature, it pos sesses the necessary qualities to deal with them. The Qjç use isan not only to call the Égun, but also to guide them, and finally to dismiss them by means of formula known only to them. Depen ding on the circumstances, the 0jç can invoke the Égun in any other place besides the îgbàlç. Although the Baba-Égun usually comes out from the Lésànyin, he can also appear in other places if circumstances demand, but it is rather exceptional for this to happen. The Qjç not only control the Égun through the isan but also separated the Égun from the world of the living. An isan placed horizontally on the floor stops the Baba from going beyond that place where the isan lies. The isan can also be held by the Égun as a whip. Such an occasion is an event to be feared because it suggests the anger of the ancestors and the punish ment which he may impose. The isan are kept in the îgbàlç and must always remain upright. A group of isan placed upright arranged like the frame of a wigwam, crossing each other just below the points, indicates the presence of the 0jç in that area and warns the passers-by and local inha bitants of the rites to be imminently performed by the members of the sect 36. 34.

Also Manuel Querino documents " with a small switch he hit the floor 3 times which is the equivalent of invoking the spirit of the dead A Raça Africana, op. cit., p. 9*7.</page><page sequence="18">96 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES HIERARCHIES The members of a " terreiro " of the Egûngûn form a male secret society. Each of these societies possesses a site and an organization of its own. In view of the fact that all the priests of all the Egûngûn terreiros are initiated into a common secret, so do they belong to a masonery which makes them all brothers. The organization of the various " terreiros " differ little one from the other. We can distinguish various categories of members depending on the res pective degrees of initiation, length of membership, and specific duties. The passage from one category to another is delineated by well defined rituals and can only be achieved depending on the individual behaviour of the members and the vote of acceptance by the elders. It is the elders who decide if the personal qualities and the behaviour of the novices permit them to be further initiated into the cult-mysteries. AMÜISAN The novices constitute the group of the Amüisan 37, as this name indi cates they are bearers of the isan. They don't know the secret of the sect, the awo, nor do they know the secrets of the invocation of the Baba-Égun. They are only allowed to enter the anteroom of the Lésànyin ; they do not know the îgbàlç, nor do they know how the " assentos "of the new Egun are pre pared. They look after the " barracäo " and the surrounding area and carrying the isan they keep the adepts separate from the Egun. They are responsible for the preparation of the public-places during the festivals and basically perform minor tasks, accompanying and helping the Ojè The Qjç of the future will be chosen from the Amüisan. Thus it is one step through which every Qjç must pass. Not all Amuisan move beyond this category ; there are some old members of the cult who continue being Amuisan. In Bahia initiation into the cult of Egûngûn is hereditary in some fami lies 38. The candidacy of other future Amüisan are promoted by some 37. A Dictionary of the Yoruba Language, Amusan " The one which holds the Isan (spiral striped switch) in front of an Egüngün op. cit., p. 37. Abraham records, Amûn sôn : " That which manages a switch ison... used during the Egüngün ceremony 38. It has already been mentioned that the 0je Joäo-Dois-Metros, chief of the Terreiro da Encarnaçâo was the son of Tio Serafim chief of the Terreiro of Veracruz ; Marcos Teodoro Pimentel, chief of the Terreiro of Tuntun was the son of Tio Marcos-the-Old, Chief of the Terreiro Mocambo, the 0jè Eduardo Daniel de Paula, Chief of the Terreiro lié Agbôulâ was the son of Tio Manoei Antonio, 0jè of the Terreiro of Tuntun.</page><page sequence="19">ANCESTOR WORSHIP IN BAHIA : THE ÉGUN-CULT 97 senior Qjè or a candidate may be chosen by an Égun. Finally, special cir cumstances in the life of a boy or adolescent may oblige the family to have him initiated. On yet other occasions, also due to certain specific events, the BabaV awo is consulted and may recommend, after consulting the Ifâ-oracle, that the person should be initiated into the cult. In all such cases, it is only after the vote of the senior Qjç and the approval of the Egun, that the can didate can be initiated. The initiation at lésç Orisà is totally different from the initiation lésç Egun. Whereas the novice lésç Orisà, is being prepared as an Adôsù in order to receive the Orisà by means of possession, the Amûisan is prepared so that, as an Qjç, he shall share and be initiated into a mystery. The state of possession is incompatible with the duties and practices of an Qjç. OjE The Qjè constitute the priestly body of the cult. They are initiated into a secret which they must keep above all else. They are united by a pact between themselves and between them and the spirits. This pact is sacro sanct, immutable and permanent. The oath which binds the Qjè to the cult forever is sealed by the introjec tion of earth, leaves and of a ritual beverage which contains symbolic ele ments which render this union unbreachable. The most important obli gation which the Qjç undertakes at oath is silence, not to reveal the awo. In the old days failure to fulfill the clauses of the oath could result in punish ment and even in death. Failure to fulfill the terms of the oath, or indescretion on the part of the Qjç are severely punished. By the pact which he has made with the earth and with the spirits the Qjè submits himself to their judgment. The initiation of the Amuisan to become an Qjè begins in the " barracâo " where he is presented by two Qjç-àgbà to the public. Once the ritual chants have been sung in the presence of all the Qjç, the Amûisan who is the central figure of the ceremony, hands over the animals and ether elements which will be offered and used during the initiation rites. The offering of a quadruped is indispensable. The Amûisan is naked from the waist up, is barefoot, his trousers are rolled up and he has been blind folded with a new, white towel. He is led by one of the Qjç-àgbà out from the " barracâo ". Still blind-folded, he is led towards the IU-awo while the following chant is being sung : 1. Olçrun awo 2. Bàlç Olçrun awo 3. Bàlç Olçrun (is the) mystery (the secret) Igbàlç is the mystery of Olçrun The îgbàlç 7</page><page sequence="20">98 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES The blind-fold will only be taken off much later in the anteroom of the Lésà nyin. This only done once the extensive ritual, which the Amüisan sees nothing of, has been completed. Only once the ritual drink has been embided, the questioning satisfied, the solemn oath been taken and the annointment with the blood of a sacri ficed animal (which bring to perfection the indestructability of the union) being performed, only then because he is now capable of sight, is the blind fold removed. Still the new Qjç does not enter the Igbàlç. Before he can enter the îgbàlç he will have to train in order to acquire deeper religious experience. Some times it will even be necessary for him to undergo a new ceremony. During this period he is under the supervision of one of the Qjç-àgbà who guides the new Ojç in his knowledge. Frequently the new Qjç receives the title of Qtun (first assistant to a holder of a title). In due course he will suc ceed to the title of the Qjç-àgbà whose Qtun he is. The members of the cult of the Egûngûn are known by various names. In Bahia the designation of the-guardian-of-the-Qpâ as Agbô-Qpà is un known.^ The Qjç is also known as Màriwà n. The relationship of this name with the Màriwà, palm-fronds of Igi-Qpe or Igi-Qgçrç, shredded from the mid-rib of the leaf, has yet to be established. These latter Màriwà are used for many purposes in the cult and are always present whenever there is any event associated with death or extraordinary dangers. " Their function is to isolate and to protect. During the funeral ceremonies the Màriwà are placed at all doors and windows... Màriwà are also placed round the arms of the priests and the followers in order to give them immunity and to keep the spirits at a distance. Ogün, hunter, warrier, and merciless executioner, who was the object of veneration of a secret masculine society, as well, also is bedecked with the Màriwà to insulate his destructive power. Curtains made of Màriwà are placed in front of shrines as means of affording protec tion... These Màriwà curtains have a preventive purpose in the cults. They notify everybody of the presence of imminent danger, obstructing the entry to those places where the treatment of the supernatural is delegated to initiates prepared for such functions. The presence of Màriwà also indi cates the existence of something which must remain hidden, a forbidden mystery which inspires respect and fear, some secret which can only be shared by those initiates specifically trained for this purpose " 40. The name Màriwà, (in the context of being synonymous with Qjç), applied to initiates into the secret of the Egüngün, appears in various myths and ritual chants. 39.

The elders In Bahia, the highest position in the hierarchy of each " terreiro " is the Alägbä. He is the most senior Oje of his " terreiro ". There is unanimity among those few scholars who have described the Egun-cult as to the exis tence of the title Alägbä and his respective functions 41. He is known as : Alägbä Baba Màriwo Alägbä, father of the Màriwo His senior assistant is the Qtûn-Alägbä (" his right-hand man "). In Bahia the Qtûn assumes the post of Alägbä on the death of the title-holder. Subor dinate to these in the hierarchy is a group of title-holders. Their import ance depends more on the seniority of the Qjè than on the title itself. Some very senior Qjç who are highly respected within the cult may have no special title other than that of Qjç. All the incumbents of the above positions are known by the generic desi gnation of Àgbà-Qjç. In the same way as the Alägbä is the head of the " terreiro the Aläpini is the head of all the masonery 42. There are as many Alägbä as there are " terreiros " of Égun. But there can only be one Aläpini. Hence the saying : Aläpini Ipekun Qjç Alapini the absolute title-holder. 41. Reverend Samuel Johnson was one of the first to document the title and describe its function, The History of the Yorubas, C.M.S., (Nigeria) Bookshops, Lagos, 1966, p. 29. 42. Johnson states that the Aläpini was a noble-man " sharing the most important privileges of the house of Oyo op. cit., p. 30.</page><page sequence="22">100 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES The word ipekun means the end, completion, final limit, signifying the supreme and absolute post in the hierarchy. In Bahia, because of the non-existence of known royal-houses nor of the lineage of the Aläpini, this title is not hereditary. It is bestowed in reco gnition of merit, on one of the Alägbä 43. MALE ÎJÔYÈ Certain titles, oyè, are given to people who are followers* of the cult. In some cases they are relations of the Qjç. In others they are given the titles because of their prominent position in the negro-social life of Bahia or because of the services which they rendered to the cult and which make them sui table subjects to receive such honours. The titles are bestowed in public ceremonies by the Baba-Égun in person and must be confirmed by the appropriate ceremonies which include the handing over of the preceptual offerings. It is a tradition that the new holder of the title should present a new chair on the occasion of his installation. From then on this will be his official chair in the " barracäo The title-holders constituted the group known as the îjôyè 44. ALÄGBE Independent of all the above mentioned categories every " terreiro " has its own group of Alâgbe, the drummers who perform during the festivals. They are chosen by the Egun in the first instance and their appointment is confirmed by specific rites. They may or may not be chosen from among the group of the Amüisan. In Bahia, the drummer is not a professional. On each " terreiro " there is an Alâgbe with his assistants, Qtün and Osi (lit. right and left), an ago go player and another who plays the sçkçrç45. They are the official players and are responsible for the ritual instruments of the " terreiro ". They know every type of beat, greeting and the ritual chants, specifically for each and every Egun. 43. One of the most illustrious Aläpini was Marcos Teodoro Pimentel, chief of the Terrelro of Tuntun. 44. Ijôyè or Ajdyè is the way that this word is pronounced at the lié Agbôulà.

Although they are absolutely forbidden from participating in the secret of the Lésànyin, they fulfill specific functions in the cult and are highly respected in the commu nity. The higher ranking post in the hierarchy which are open to women in Bahia are : lyâ-Egbé : She is the leader of all the female participants. It is she who receives all the information concerning the cult and it is she who is res ponsible for carrying out the wishes of the Égun. She is the first to be greeted by the Baba. Usually she is an old person who occupies a promi nent position in the community. Like the Alâgbâ the Iyâ-egba has her own O^wn-and Ôsi. Iyâ-Mondç : She is the leader of the female worshippers of the Egüngün. She passes on all the requests and messages made by the women to the Baba. She is the most frequent leader of the ritual chants entoned by the women. She also by means of chants can solicit the presence of the Égun. She too has her Qtün and Osi. Îyâ-Agçn or îyàgan : She is responsible for receiving and handing over the offerings made to the Égun. She too has her Qtün and Ôsi. Other titles with various duties are : Îyâlé-Alâgbâ, îyàkéheré, îyâlçjà, îyàmoro, îyâ Mon-Yoyo, Elémàsô. THE EGTJNGÛN Classification, speech, clothing and preceptual rites The Ojç are intermediaries between the living and the dead. They are responsible for making the spirits visible and making them appear publicly. This is the main object of the initiation of the Qjç. An Qjè learns to deal with the mystery of death and with the derivative relations. He learns the secret of the invocation and handling of the dead. The well-known scholar Ulli Beier has written, " the spirit which is being worshipped is considered to be neither good nor evil but is conceived as a power for either qualities. Being a power it is potentially dangerous if wrongly treated but if worshipped in the correct way it will help the com munity by protecting it... and bringing children " 46. Further on Beier says : " The appearance of the Egûngûn... underlines the feeling of oneness 46. Ulli Beier, " The Egungun Cult Nigeria Magazine, Lagos, 1956, n° 51, p. 392.</page><page sequence="24">102 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES between the living and the dead and will fill the crowd with a feeling of love as well as of awe " 47. The Égun-society, by making the ancestral spirits evident, is fulfilling one of its more important functions : making immortality, a basic concept of Yoruba philosophy, incontestable and unchallengeable. The ()jl is the means of executing and making effective the functions which the Egun-society fulfills in the community. He performs those rituals based on such functions and is the guardian of the Égun worshipped on the " terreiro ". In Bahia, the Qjç who takes care of an Egun is known by the name of Atokè, recorded by Abraham and in " A Dictionary of the Yoruba Language " as Atokùni&amp;. The Atokè is always a senior Qjç. An Qjç can be the Atokè of more than one Égun. He is responsible for invoking the Égun, attending on them and making them visible. Each Egun has his own characteristic clothing, which suggests the outline of a human form. Each Egun carries specific symbols, has his own chants and forms of greeting which identify him. The forms differ from Egun to Egun according to the category in which they may be grouped : A. Those classified as Baba-Égun or Égun-Àgbà are characterized by the large number of strips of cloth with which they are bedecked. They only make public appearances at the major ceremonies of the cult or at the annual festival which is dedicated to them. The conjunct of the clothing of each Égun is known in Bahia as Qpâ. This name is derived from Qpâkàko (vide supra), the collective " assento " of the Egüngun, because in the last instance in the same way as the staff Qpâ represents the Egun so are the cloths the only visible sign of the pre sence of an Égun. The strips of cloth, falling down as a curtain, are fixed to a solid piece which may be either square or round and forms the top off the Qpâ. All this is known as the abala. The strips of cloth are of different colours and profusely decorated with mirrors, cowry-shells, small bells and beads. The movement of the overlapping strips of the abala allow the onlooker to per ceive a sort of a boiler-suit called kàfô, in the front of which is the bànté, a sort of narrow, rectangular apron. The bànté is an article of clothing which characterizes the Égun-Àgbà and is a fundamental preceptual object. The designs made by the mirrors and cowry-shells on the bànté individualize each Égun. These symbolic designs are related to the mystery of each Égun and constitute his most powerful attribute. At the Terreiro Ilé-Agbôulâ, the Égun call Baba Olûkçtûn is regarded 47. Bolaji Idowu also writes : " ... thus they are possessors of limitless potentialities which they can exploit for the benefit or to the detriment of those who still live on earth. For that reason, it is necessary to keep them in a state of peaceful contentment. " op. cit., p. 192. 48. Abbaham, op. cit., p. 27.</page><page sequence="25">ANCESTOR WORSHIP IN BAHIA : THE ÉGUN-CULT 103 as the king, leader of all the Egûngûn. Thus he is Olûkçtûn Olôri Égun (lit. lord and master of the Égun) whereas the Baba Agbôulâ is the patron of the " terreiro The list of Baba-Agbà worshipped on this " terreiro " is immense. Some of the oldest are : Alâàte-Qrun, Olçjapiu, Olçjà-Qrun, Olàgbojà, Ardsojû, Okoto, Awolàse, Adé-Qrun, Ajopç. The Egun Baba Alâpala stands out from the other Baba-Àgbà and is feared to an exceptional degree because of his enormous power. He is called Onidân, owner-of-the-îdâre, supernatural power. His clothing is red and flowing, differentiating him from the other Baba-àgbà. B. Another category of Égun is well represented by the Égun called Alâàpàriyô or Alâàpôyç. This Égun has neither abala nor bànté. His clo thing looks like an enormous sack which extends into a long tail dragging over the floor. C. Another category of Égun are the so called Apâàràkâ. They are completely flat in appearance, in a rectangular form when seen from the front, in very narrow form when seen in profile. As was the case of the preceding category they have neither abala nor bànté. Their clothing is of vivid colour, with large flamboyant designs. Generally they appear accompanying the Égun-àgbà. Whereas the Égun-àgbà represent the ancestors of important families, the Apâàràkâ are new spirits whose rites have not yet been completed. They are unable to talk and rely on the Baba-àgbà to speak for them. The Égun speak in a very curious manner : some in a deep hoarse and cavernous voice. Others speak in a very low but high-pitched voice. This particular manner of speaking has already been mentioned with reference to the myth describing the relationship between Oya and the Egûngûn. Whereas the first eight children of Oya, as well as the Arâ-çrun and the Apâàràkâ, are mute, the Égun speak with a voice which is not human. In the afore mentioned myth Oya appears having founded the Égun-sect with a monkey that frightened people. When the men took from the hands of Oya her power, they began to use it to invoke the Égun. They spoke in a tone of voice imitating that of the monkey which Johnson refers to as the Ijimirè 49. The Ojç are capable of invoking the Égun in any place and for those cir cumstances demanding. Even if the Baba does not appear himself, he answers and can be heard, giving his orders and messages. The manner in which he speaks is known in Bahia as ségi50 and his word is respected as law. The voice alone of the Egûngûn carries with it all the 49. S. Johnson, op. cit., p. 29. 50. The Dictionary of the Yoruba Language also records, " Ségi : To speak like an Egun gun, to speak an unnatural tone op. cit., p. 205.

The presence of the Baba is often manifested only through his voice ; his bodily form may not appear and one hears only his messages and blessings. For this reason the voice of the Égun is as feared as the apparition itself. Knowing the deep importance that words and sounds have for the Yorùbâ, one can understand the profound meaning of the Égun-ségi. When the first cry, raucous but powerful, is heard from the Egûn-àgbà calling : Awon omo nilé Agbôulâ, o ku o ! Children of the house of Agbôulâ, I greet you ! chants and drum-beat alike stop. A respectful silence spreads over the " barracäo " while the faithful of the " terreiro " anxiously await the arrival of the ancestral father. Generally the Egun enter chanting : 1. Ago àgà tabi mäwole Have I your leave to enter this house ? 2. Onilé mo ki, àgà I am greeting the head of the house, may I come in ? 3. Iyà-Egbé mo ki, àgo I am greeting Iyà-Egbé, may I come in ? 4. Àgà âlà, àgo nilé o. May I cross the threshold of this house ? Have I your leave to enter this house ? Ending this chant, the Égun calls : Omodé mi o ! Oh, my children ! All the members of the " terreiro " reply : 0 ! Baba mi ! Oh ! My father ! and thus communication is established between both worlds. The communication, provoked and controlled by the Ojç, will continue for several days. Different rituals will take place with the apparition of determined Egun in accordance with the festival or the specific nature of the rites to be performed during the festival. Numerous sacrifices will be made and food distributed. During the festivities the Qjç remain isolated in the recluse of the Lésàn yin. Of their activities nobody knows anything ; nor when they eat or when they sleep. Nor may his family or relatives approach him. During the festivals whole families move to the " terreiro " ; luggage and all temporally settle in to houses adjacent. The " terreiro " is con verted into a village on which the uninterrupted drum-beat and chants fill the air. At night-fall men and women together gather in the " barracäo</page><page sequence="27">ANCESTOR WORSHIP IN BAHIA : THE ÉGUN-CULT 105 The doors are locked and a careful vigil kept over them by the Amûisan. Those persons who for one reason or another cannot attend the festival, lock themselves in the houses. With the exception of the Qjç and some Amûisan, not one human being is to be found outside the "barracäo". The Egun are invoked and with them the Arâ-orun will take over all the area. As the women chant and the drum-beat throbs on hailing the Baba, all outside is silence, interrupted only by the particular salutation and cries of the Qjç leading the Égun. Running steps, the strokes of the isan, and emphatic words are heard : 1. Lésà-lésà... Carefully, with patience... 2. Pçlé-pçlé Baba mi... Keep calm my father... guiding and calming the ancestral spirits. All night the Égun are invoked and will appear until dawn. They appear either isolated or in groups, but always cared for by the Amûisan. ^ On the last day of the festival, having ended all the preceptual rites the Egun take their leave. As they leave the " barracäo chants are voiced by the Égun blessing and greeting the faithful, assuring them that all ran well and had been propitious ; Arûfin àrûdà. As they take their leave they sing : 1. 0 seré mo nlo o 2. Omodé ko (i)re yin àgbà 3. Mo juba omodé o 4. Mo jûbà àgbàlâgbà I've had fun celebrating ; I am going That no misfortune may fall to you, my children ; that you may all reach old age. I salute the young. I salute the old. CALENDAR The festivals of the Égun-cult at the lié Agbôulà take place according to a well observed lithurgical calendar. During these festivals there are included, if possible, the unexpected and non-periodic rituals such as the initiation of Amuisan and 0j$ that do not have pre-determined dates, offe rings and special rites recommended by the Egun, installation rites of the title-holders. As death itself cannot be predicted, other non-periodic rites, specifically those of funeral-rites inside or out of " terreiro ", are performed separately from the above-mentioned festivals. Four annual festivals take place : A. In January, for the New Year, the fulfillment of cult-obligations is carried out until the ninth day. These rituals begin with that dedicated to Onilfr and followed by the Qdûn Olukçtûn, the annual festival dedicated</page><page sequence="28">106 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES to Baba Olûkçtun. Together with this are celebrated the annual ceremonies of Baba Alâpala and Olôgbojà. B. In February, beginning on the second day and continuing for two weeks a very special festival takes place. This is related to the fact of the community being settled on the sea, making the fruits of the sea their live lihood. This festival is dedicated to the water-goddesses Osun and Yemanja 51 and to the god of creation Osàlà. It is a propitiatory cycle of rituals patro nized by the ancestors of the community and by the Baba Égun 52. C. In September, from the seventh to the seventeenth the annual Odun Agbôulâ followed by the Odun Baba Bakàbakà are performed. At this time, the harvest of the first fruits is done. Until recently farming and the reaping of fruit had been the bases of living in the community. It cannot be ignored that the Island of Itaparica was for a long time the furnisher of fruit for Salvador 53. D. In November, taking advantage of the Catholic holiday commemo rating the dead, the cult-obligation for Oya Igbàlç, Queen of the Dead, takes place 54. At this festival a large number of Egun appear. DEATH AND THE 0JÈ It is no easy accomplishment to be accepted and initiated into the awo, the secret mystery of the cult. Formerly in Bahia, the more outstanding representatives and those having the deepest knowledge in the Nàgô reli gion and traditions belonged to the cult. In Qyç the Aläpini is one of the seven great noble-men and is part of the community council, QyQ-Misi. His duty is secular as well as religious as he is the senior title-holder and paramount chief of the Égun cult. It is in the house of the Aläpini where the future Aläfin (King of Qyo) will receive his first instructions on the long procession towards becoming King. There is a strong link between the King and the Égun-cult as is readily appa 51. Ösun and Yemanja are two water godesses of the Yorùbà pantheon, whose worship is extensive in Bahia. 52. For a description of this festival see Deoscoredes M. dos Santos, " Festa da Mäe d'Agua in Ponta de Areia, Itaparica op. cit., pp. 65-75. 53. The relationship between the Égun festivals and farming is documented by diffe rent authors. Geoffrey Parrinder describes : " The great annual appearances of the Egùngun are the chief communal ancestral rites of the Yoruba. In early June, the time of farming, when the help of the ancestors is most needed, their visible representatives appear. " In West African Religion, Epworth Press, London, 1961, p. 123. 54.

Johnson also states : " The Egûngûn worship has become a national religious institution, and its anniversaries are celebrated with grand festi vities. The mysteries connected with it are held sacred and inviolable. " The most noble families have an Egûngûn, founder of the lineage who is respectfully worshipped. Each of the various districts of large cities have their Alâgbâ and a group of Qjç representing different lineages. Even today in Bahia to gain entrance into the Égun cult is a great privi lege obtained through heritage or by personal and relevant merit. Oral tradition maintains that only the true born, omo-bibi, have the right to become Atokè and to materialize the Egun. Servants, criminals or other wise indebted do not have the right to carry the isan, must less, to guide or to invoke the Égun. 1. Erû ilé yin nwon o ni gbçdç jô 2. Ôlçfà be o gbçdç 'jôyè 3.

The Qjç-àgbà are very respected public figures. Usually silent and great obser vers, they possess a personality which distinguishes them. Accustomed to deal with death, to invoke and to worship death, they possess a deep wisdom of life and can confront any contingency with extraordinary calm and objectivity. They appear to possess the secret of life and of death. 1. Se awo ki 'ku Those that make the mystery, (the initiates), never die 2. Awo M 'rùn The initiates are never corrupt 3.

Thus, they will be in death, as they were in life, the unchall engeable and incontestable representatives of immortality, symbols and memory of the origins of their race.</page></plain_text>
