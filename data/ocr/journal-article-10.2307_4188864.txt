<plain_text><page sequence="1">Advertising Research and Advertising Practice From In 1974, Dan Stewart published a thought-provoking editorial entitled, "Advertising Re- search" (JA, Volume 3, Number 1). In the editorial, he advises researchers to define the their terms carefully in order that they might develop "scientific knowledge about the communication process" (p. 50). Stewart (1 974) poses several important questions for Editor advertising researchers: "What do we really believe about the basic nature of man?" "What are the basic (ontological) presuppositions of ... the semantic differential?" What are the basic assumptions of "the depth interview?" Almost twenty years later, we still do not have definite answers to these key questions (Zinkhan 1992). In a paragraph-ending, italicized sentence, Stewart argues that, "As long as the adver- tiser believes that the 'real world' can be explained in terms of anthropomorphism, valid scientific research on the advertising-consumer behavior relation is not likely to receive much encouragement anywhere" (p. 49). In general, I agree with this statement as it applies to the development of communication theories. Here, "anthropomorphism" means humanization or applying human characteristics to objects (or things) which are not human. The process of "humanization" may be one way to create metaphors or myths, which may tell us something about advertising phenomena. However, as Stewart argues, there may be "different theories that govern" the process of communi- cation. That is, we may be able to come up with "non-anthropomorphic" theories of communication which explain better than "anthropomorphic" theories. Anthropomorphic explanations are associated with myth making and are therefore perceived as "non- scientific." However, in advertising practice, an important communication objective is to breathe life into otherwise inanimate objects. For example, the services provided by financial institutions are abstract, difficult to grasp, and potentially cold and inhuman. As a solu- tion, financial services advertisers may promote the personality of "Tillie, the Talking Teller," who in reality is an inanimate object - an automatic teller machine (Zinkhan and Zinkhan 1989). Similarly, Met Life sometimes promotes its services by using "Snoopy the Dog" - a cartoon character who himself possesses human characteris- tics. Or, anytime that a spokesperson (celebrity or otherwise) appears in a commercial, one potential benefit is humanizing the advertised product or service by providing a so- cial context. Also, within the context of advertising strategy, we are quite familiar with the concept of "brand personality"; and (presumably), as advertising researchers, we are quite comfortable with the idea of measuring brand personality. All of the promotional campaigns and strategies discussed in the above paragraph make use of personification ("the representation of a thing as a person" or "the repre- sentation of an abstraction by the human form"). So, here we uncover a paradox. If Stewart's arguments are true, in the name of science, we may want to avoid anthropo- morphic explanations in advertising research. However, if advertising practice is cor- rect, then personification is a very powerful marketing technique. For a variety of rea- sons, social scientists tend to avoid anthropomorphic explanations. In contrast, adver- tisers not only strive to give human characteristics to their brands but also they take this process a step further by providing advertised brands with distinct personalities (so as to bring them to life). From this perspective, social scientists who study advertising or communication face a special challenge, as personification is such a key concept for understanding how advertising works.
