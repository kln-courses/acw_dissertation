<plain_text><page sequence="1">Numen, Vol. XXIX, Fasc. 2 RISE AND FALL* (Review article) A. WASSERSTEIN With volume 16 of Part II the editors of Aufstieg und Niedergang der Romischen Welt begin the publication of the material relating to religion in the Roman Empire. They deal mostly with the first three imperial centuries but cannot avoid here and there going back to the republican and hellenistic periods. This is inevitable for a number of different reasons: partly because of the nature of this work, since it is not structured as a single unitary work informed by the synoptic plan and the connected and correlated interests of a single author; it is an amorphous collection of papers interesting, valuable and important in themselves, but not growing together in- to a coherent whole. To this architectonic limitation there is added another: the subject matter treated here is not Roman religion but the religions of the Roman world. These are many and various, although they are roughly classifiable (as is done here) into polytheistic and monotheistic religions, the latter being practically confined to Judaism and Christianity. Of the volumes reviewed here II 16, 1-2 and II 17,1 deal with the former group; while volume II 19 begins the treatment of Judaism and volume II 23 is the first of a series dealing with early Christianity, particularly that of the first three centuries. Volumes II 8 and 9 do not treat of religion as such but are concerned with the political, social, and * Aufstieg und Niedergang der R6mischen Welt. II.Teil. Principat. Band 8 ed.

Readers of this journal will, of course, be more interested in the volumes devoted specifically to religion. Even so, they will find much to interest and to instruct them in the "historical" volumes; for they describe those political and social conditions in biblical and other lands an understanding of which is often indispensable for understanding religious, sec- tarian and ecclesiastical developments. As I have noted above, this work is not a unified history of ancient religions. It is a collection of papers not always obviously related to each other. Hence the reviewer cannot address himself to those points which normally engage his attention: What are the principal questions that the author poses to himself? What use does he make of the material available to him in discussing these ques- tions? Are his conclusions reasonable and acceptable? How do they fit into the larger framework of knowledge and scholarly preoccupa- tion in the field with which he deals? In our case the reviewer must be content with indicating, sum- marily, what the contents of these volumes are, addressing himself only selectively to some issues raised by one of the authors or another. Inevitably, the reviewer's choice will be arbitrary and will be largely dictated by the idiosyncrasy of his interests and even more severely by the limits imposed by his lack of familiarity with, and knowledge of, the vast amount of material offered here. There cannot be many readers of these volumes able to boast the erudition required for dealing adequately with all the contributions here published. Even the summary indication of the contents will have to be extremely selective: a simple list of the articles contained in these volumes and of the names of their authors, with only a word or two of comment, would require a number of pages larger perhaps than can be devoted to the review as a whole. I shall therefore confine myself, in general, to mentioning only those articles which seem to me to be of wider and more general interest. It ought to be said, however, that there are here also a great number of other extremely learned and useful papers of more specialist appeal. Vols. II 8 and II 9, 1-2 are mainly concerned with historical, political, social and economic matters. Of the many important papers offered here I mention only the following:</page><page sequence="3">222 A. Wasserstein B. Lifshitz, Etudes sur l'histoire de la province de Syrie, a short paper including a valuable discussion of cults and divinities; the same author's Scythopolis. L 'histoire, les institutions et les cultes de la ville ai l'ipoque hellinistique et impiriale; H. J. W. Drijvers, Hatra, Palmyra und Edessa. Die Stddte der syrisch-mesopotamischen Wiiste in politischer, kulturgeschichtlicher und religionsgeschichtlicher Beleuchtung, a paper characterized by outstanding erudition, exemplary clarity in ex- position, and extraordinary facility in bringing together the results of archaeological, historical, and literary investigations, using all the resources of philology, numismatics, and epigraphy (in the part of this monograph which is devoted to Palmyra Drijvers acknowledges the collaboration of M. J. Versteegh); J. Neusner, TheJews East of the Euphrates and the Roman Empire I. lst-3rd Centuries A.D. (interesting not only for the material on the history of Babylo- nian Jewry but also for the light it throws on the relations between the Jews outside the empire and the nation in its homeland); and finally, a valuable short paper at the beginning of Halbband 9,2, by Albrecht Dihle, Die entdeckungsgeschichtlichen Voraussetzungen des Indienhandels der romischen Kaiserzeit, not indeed concerned with religion, but of great importance nevertheless to students of religious and cultural diffusion, since it raises in passing the in- teresting question how far e.g. the first beginnings and the later developments of Christianity in India, or the hellenistic influences in the plastic arts in India and other regions of Asia are to be related to commercial connections between Rome and India. Volumes 16, 1-2 deal with Roman religion in the narrower sense. They contain enlightening discussions of the literary sources of our knowledge of Roman religion; of relevant archaeological and even architectural material; they treat of cultic issues in relation to temples, to priests, and to the emperors; we are offered investiga- tions of the origins and the nature of Roman feasts; we can also read here about the philosophical aspects of Roman religion and, as is inevitable, a good deal of discussion about the relation of religion and state (emperor), both in Rome and in the provinces; we read also about religion in the army and in domestic life, about philosophy and magic and dreams and many other things. Of the more general contributions I would mention the learned and extremely useful paper by J. Beaujeu, Le paganisme romain sous le</page><page sequence="4">Rise and Fall 223 Haut Empire, a short but instructive introduction to the subject which in spite of its brevity manages to combine a "Forschungs- geschichte" with a discussion of the source material. The author remarks pertinently that the time has not yet come for a synthetic treatment of the religious history of the Roman empire. If this state- ment about the present implies a hope for the future, the reader, or some readers, will, perhaps inevitably, ask whether the time for such a synthesis will ever come. The nature and form of the publishing enterprise of ANRW as it is presented by the editors is such that it must, if it is justifiable at all, be justified precisely on the ground that a synthetic treatment of all the issues and problems involved in the history of religion(s) in the Roman empire is impossible. Another welcome bibliographical contribution, much longer in extent but considerably more restricted in scope is that of P. Herz, Bibliographie zum romischen Kaiserkult (1955-1975). Mr. Harold W. Attridge's The Philosophical Critique of Religion under the Early Empire offers a useful and perceptive survey of criticism of religion in general and of particular religious beliefs and practices. This criticism originated often in philosophical circles, but the arguments developed there were used elsewhere, too. In his clear exposition of Sceptic agnosticism based on criticism of theistic and anti-theistic arguments Mr. Attridge rightly notes that this exposition of various theological arguments is based on a long pro- cess of scholastic systematization and transmission. (In his discus- sion of the various arguments advanced for and against the theist position as expounded by "Socrates" in Xen. Memorabilia 1.4.2 [S.E.Adv.Phys. 1.92-97] he does not seem to me to do justice altogether adequately to the criticism [of the Socratic position] as reported by Sextus Empiricus. The criticism of the "Socratic" inductive argument is based on an analogy between the microcosm of the human body and the macrocosm, as is evidenced by the use of the analogy between the four "elements" and the four "humours"; this fact is ignored by the theistic rebuttal of this criticism.) He also makes the point that the theology of the Epicureans was in some ways quite conservative, not only in main- taining the anthropomorphism of the gods but also in its respect for traditional cult practices; and that their opposition to particular</page><page sequence="5">224 A. Wasserstein cultic phenomena was closely bound up with their rejection of arguments for providence and fate. In his treatment of the Cynic Oenomaus of Gadara one would have welcomed discussion or at least mention of the remarkable and somewhat paradoxical fact that his most virulent critic in antiquity was Julian the Apostate, and that practically all the rest of our knowledge about him comes from Christian and Jewish sources (Oenomaus is one of the very few Greek philosophers mentioned in ancient rabbinic literature). What becomes clear from Attridge's survey of ancient criticism of traditional religious beliefs and practices is the pervasive influence, on non-philosophical critics no less than on philosophers, of Cynic and Epicurean arguments; these are found even in authors whose attitude to religion is generally favourable, and Attridge points out that the combination of criticism and positive piety is common in the first two centuries of the Christian era. This combination is, of course, found in Stoic circles, but also among Neopythagoreans. Whether Philo really belongs in this company of philosophical critics of religion seems to me doubtful; for his attitude to pagan religion is, I should have thought, primarily informed by his adherence to Judaism, another religion. Nevertheless, Attridge is right to note that Philo draws on the tradition of philosophical con- demnation of pagan religious superstition for arguments in his apologetic exposition of Jewish belief. In the last part of this valuable paper Attridge makes the in- teresting point that, as time went on, religious philosophy became less critical of religious belief and practice, and that the arguments which philosophers had developed were taken up and exploited by Christians, while philosophers sought to understand, defend and rationalise religious phenomena. This is an excellent paper, clearly argued and well presented. (By the way, Mr. Attridge's proofreader has not served him well; twice on the same page 51 he attributes to him the suggestion that sorites is the plural form of the name of the well known logical fallacy). In Das romische Fatum - Begriff und Verwendung W. P6tscher begins with a thorough investigation of the etymological connexions of Fatum/Fata and then examines the literary evidence as found in Virgil, in Silver Latin epic writers, and in Seneca, Pliny and</page><page sequence="6">Rise and Fall 225 Tacitus. He emphasizes the religious (and the philosophical) com- ponent of the term fatum against W. F. Otto and others who had argued that fatum belongs to the domain of poetical diction and that it originally had little to do with religious categories. The portion of this paper devoted to literary exemplification and illustration is well done. We find here much that is instructive and plausible, and we learn a good deal of the religious and philosophical contents of the fatum concept in early imperial Rome. I am rather less happy with the introductory section: it is informative and it contains much material that many readers will find interesting and indeed fascinating; but the author seems to me to put too much trust in the efficacy of the etymological method; the genetic history of a word does not always enlighten us about the content of a concept denoted by that word in actual use. Herr P6tscher is a serious scholar; but playing around with etymologies is a serious and dangerous pastime, potentially harmful to truth and always liable to lead us astray, particularly if it is meant to issue in conclusions of historical or philosophical significance. The example of Heidegger should provide a salutary warning. In The Ruler and the Logos in Neopythagorean, Middle Platonic and Late Stoic Political Philosophy, Mr. Glenn F. Chesnut examines an impor- tant and widespread tradition which regarded the ruler as the embodiment on earth of the Law or Reason or Logos of God. In its philosophical formulation this doctrine may have had its roots in various Neopythagorean writings. Traces or echoes of it can, however, be found in the most varied sources, such as Plutarch and Seneca and even earlier, in Cicero, and in Philo of Alexandria, and it survived into the age of the new religion when Eusebius pro- claimed that the Christian emperor was the image on earth of the heavenly rulership of the divine Logos. Mr. Chesnut tends to accept an early dating for the so-called Pythagorean Pseudepigrapha (which some scholars would put as early as the third century B.C., while others go down as far as the second century A.D.). But quite independently of any attempt at a precise dating he ascribes great importance to this material for illuminating an otherwise fairly dark and unknown area of political thought, and sees in it "an extreme version of the official political philosophy which formed the intellectual underpinning for the</page><page sequence="7">226 A. Wasserstein Romano-Hellenistic ruler cult." It is interesting to see how varied the philosophical elements are that seem to have gone into the for- mulation of the doctrine of the divine ruler. They come from Plato and the Pythagoreans, the Stoics and the Cynics; and one is struck by the fact that the theoreticians go so far as to turn the Stoic paradox "only the wise man is king" upside down: the king, as such, is wise and pure and divine. Mr. Chesnut perhaps forces his material a little in order to fit the echoes in Cicero to his thesis. But he seems to me to be completely justified in pointing to passages in Philo which use at least the ter- minology that we find also in ancient writers on divine kingship. Thus he draws attention to the fact that Philo speaks of Moses as the nomos empsychos kai logikos, the rational (or: articulate?) embodi- ment of the Law. (For more on this see Mr. Charles H. Talbert's paper mentioned below.) Now, it is, of course, true that for Philo such an expression, whatever he may have meant precisely by it, whether he was speaking allegorically, analogically, figuratively, rhetorically, hyperbolically, no matter how his expression should be classified, clearly did not mean anything that would in any way amount to a departure from strict monotheism, or to the ascription of divinity to a human being in any sense that would be parallel to that which would be understood by a pagan. Nevertheless, expres- sions such as that quoted above and others like it may well come from sources which through other channels delivered a rather dif- ferent message couched in the same terms. Still, to say, as Mr. Chesnut does, that this general pagan mode of thought affected contemporary Jewish ideas seems to me exaggerated. Words mean different things to different users. And although it is true and significant that Eusebius like Philo uses language reminiscent of that which we find in pagan hellenistic and Roman writers about the relation of the ruler to God and/or the Logos, yet it is equally true in both cases that for the Christian as for the Jew, whatever language they used, and whatever metaphors or similes or hyper- bolae insinuated themselves into their expositions, it remained clear that the ruler was a man, that he was not of divine nature, that he was subject to the Law of God, that he remained capable of sinning, and that he was liable to be held responsible for his sins. Still, Mr. Chesnut does well to show how pervasive the language of the ruler</page><page sequence="8">Rise and Fall 227 cult is. And it is, of course, true that the use of certain kinds of language may have much to do with the moulding of attitudes. And it is certainly true that the Christian conception of the emperor's temporal reign being a reflection on earth of the heavenly and eter- nal Logos had drawn much on pagan philosophical discourse. One small point: Mr. Chesnut ought perhaps also to have addressed himself to the not uninteresting question as to how far hellenistic ideas of the divine ruler were themselves influenced by oriental theory and practice. In Biographies of Philosophers and Rulers as Instruments of Religious Propaganda in mediterranean Antiquity Mr. Charles H. Talbert ex- amines the nature and function of biographies of teachers and rulers in their cultic and religious connections, their use of myth, their use of "succession" lists, and particularly the place of the synoptic Gospels among such biographies. Of especial interest here I found the discussion of the function of succession lists and nar- ratives. There existed a wellknown genre of "Philosophiege- schichte" in antiquity arranged in diadochai, of which we have ex- amples in Diogenes Laertius and in the rabbinic tradition, most notably in the Mishna Tractate Aboth. It was the function of such succession narratives to give not only a connected history of earlier philosophical or theological traditions, but also, and indeed primarily, to use the "fact" of the "succession" as an instrument for validating the doctrines of an existing school. Mr. Talbert does well to remind us in this context that the life of an ancient philosophical school often exhibits features reminiscent of that of a religious community; though he goes perhaps a little too far in choosing as an illustration the Epicurean school. He quotes much impressive evidence to support his interpretation, but much of this seems to be the expression of rhetorical exaggeration and the result of the enthusiastic use of figurative language rather than dry and precise description of real fact or belief. Even though one occasional- ly feels that Mr. Talbert is somewhat overdoing the schematism of his classifications and the application of his schemata to the discus- sion of the material with which he is dealing, one is nevertheless grateful to him for incidental yet not negligible insights. Thus while one is at first a little doubtful about fitting the synoptic gospels into a scheme gained from an analysis of other ancient biographies, par-</page><page sequence="9">228 A. Wasserstein ticularly those of philosophers, yet one is grateful for being remind- ed that in reading the gospels we need not look only for theological or philosophical influences and parallels, but that there is much of interest too in studying them as belonging to a literary genre com- mon in antiquity. Inevitably Mr. Talbert had to deal also with that enigmatic figure Apollonius of Tyana and his "biography" by Philostratus. Mr. Ewen Lyall Bowie returns to this subject in his contribution Apollonius of Tyana: Tradition and Reality. This is an excellent piece of work, soundly based on minute examination of the ancient evidence and on wide reading in the secondary literature dealing with it. It is accompanied by a very useful bibliography. Signora Margherita Guarducci who has recently entertained and scandalized us by her brilliant expose on the Fibula Praenestina in its relation to nineteenth century Roman antiquaries, scholars and forgers, offers us here an equally entertaining and erudite study in Dal gioco letterale alla crittografia mistica. It is written with all her customary verve and elegance; and it introduces us to a subject not widely known to historians or classical scholars; that of cryp- tography and in particular to the use of alphabetic (and other graphic) combinations in mystical and magical procedures. Playing about with graphic signs seems to go back very far into ancient oriental history. Signora Guarducci cites from the Sumerian area cuneiform homophonies and acrostics belonging to the middle of the third millennium B.C.; and analogous phenomena from Egypt as early as the 14th century B.C., where hieroglyphic acrostics and even crossword combinations are found. Signora Guarducci gives us a great deal of fascinating and amusing material. Here we read about anagrams and palindromes, about magical squares (it is interesting to see how widespread these were; they are found over several centuries in places as diverse as Britain, Hungary, Italy, Mesopotamia), and about "Buchstabenorakel"; about versus recurrentes, and about carminafigurata; about graffiti and the use of whole or partial alphabets as votive offerings; about asigmatic poems and epics in which each of the twenty four books was written in such a way that the first book would not contain any alpha, the second book no beta, and so on through the alphabet, i.e. in such a way that each book would leave out the letter by which</page><page sequence="10">Rise and Fall 229 its own number was designated; about alphabetic "games" found on some of the so-called tabulae Iliacae; about cruciverba (e.g. the letters of the words (D~O and Z(H arranged so as to form a cruciform figure); about the symbolic and sometimes sacral value attributed to certain letters, such as A, E, 9, T, 'F; and many other entertaining things. A particular virtue of this collection of in- teresting curiosities lies in the happy combination of plentiful literary and archaeological material, together with spirited criticism of wrongheaded interpretations. Where one is offered so much it may seem greedy to wish for more. Yet, in a paper that is so rich in material about the symbolic use of alphabetic signs one may justly expect some discussion, and some illustrations, of gematria, the use of the numerical value of the letters making up a word for exegetical, homiletical, and mystical purposes. Yet, apart from the bare mention of the word isopsephia one looks in vain for any treatment of a method that was widespread among Jews and Christians, both those in the mainstream of the two religious traditions, and in the dark and sometimes unwholesome backwaters of sectarian and apocalyptic speculation in antiquity, the middle ages and down to modern times. Here is an example which I found in a 15th or 16th century Greek manuscript in St. Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai, in an orthodox, virulently anti-Roman, polemical text: A~x0-Evoc = 666 = the Antichrist (Cf. Hippol. de anti-christo, 50; and St. Irenaeus, adv. haeres. 5.30.3.)! Here is another one from antiquity (quoted by G. Scholem, EJ.7,369): 'App&amp;'ocS = M()TOpac = 365, i.e. the number of days in a solar year. Gematria (from geometria) was much used, possibly as early as the eighth century B.C., in Mesopotamia, in the Greco-Roman period, and then by Jews and Christians and Gnostics, by Jewish kabbalists in the middle ages, by Christian monks and Jewish sectarians. Incredible ingenuity was expended on finding equations and analogies by use of the various forms of gematria. It is in no spirit of churlish criticism that I offer some further comments: The translation of the famous expression in Exodus 3,14 should not read "lo sono Colui che e" but "lo sono Colui che sono"; in discussing the expression "Alpha and Omega" for Christ (Revela-</page><page sequence="11">230 A. Wasserstein tion 1,8) Signora Guarducci rightly cites Isaiah 41,4; 44,6; and 48,12. It would have contributed to the instruction of her readers if she had also discussed the isopsephic equation Alpha plus Omega = peristera, dove, found in St. Irenaeus and ascribed by him to the Gnostic Markos. (The numerical value of the Greek letters making up the word peristera is equal to that of the two letters alpha and omega = 801); Signora Guarducci brings together much in- teresting material both literary and epigraphical to illustrate the symbolic value of the Greek letter theta: as is known from a number of sources this letter symbolized, and was used to indicate, thanatos, death, e.g. in military lists, or judicially of criminals condemned to suffer capital punishment, and of gladiators; one ought to add to this the use of the symbol in medical prognosis (see Galen XVII.1,601 K.); and it would also have been useful to discuss in this context another dimension of the problem presented by the symbolical use of the letter theta: in some ancient Christian writers the letter tau symbolizes the cross (because its shape is that of the cross as used by the Romans); now, some of these writers rely in their interpretation on Ezekiel 9,4 where, in the Hebrew text, the letter taw is mentioned as a mark to be put on the foreheads of the men that are to be saved. This Hebrew letter, though by its position in the alphabetic series it corresponds to the Greek tau is yet phonetically the correlate of theta. Furthermore: In the ancient Hebrew alphabet it had the form of a cross (x). Some ancient writers, Jewish and, independently of them, Christian, use these facts and it seems clear that both Jews and Christians connect that verse with the symbolical value attached to the letters theta and taw. I have mentioned these points not out of a peevish desire to be critical, but on the contrary, because this is a rich and enlightening paper, one from which one reader at least has gained not only much valuable instruction but also much uncovenanted entertainment. And where so much is given the appetite grows with the eating. The first part of volume 17 contains a number of interesting papers on various aspects of the cults of Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, Mars and other divinities. There is much here that will enlighten many readers about Quirinus and the dei penates, about Ceres and Janus and Tellus-Terra Mater. I hope it will not be thought in- vidious if I single out three papers for especial mention:</page><page sequence="12">Rise and Fall 231 Jean-Louis Girard, Domitien et Minerve.: une pr&amp;dilection impiriale (Domitian wants to create a particular kind of image of himself: "par sa ref rence ' la sagesse guerriere, il se veut le prince des dici- sions foudroyantes et des desseins longuement mfiris.

All these volumes are exceptionally well printed and produced. They contain helpful illustrations, photographs, maps and bibliographies. Finally, it may seem ungracious of a reviewer to mention this, but it should not be left unsaid: the price of every one of these volumes is such that one cannot imagine that many scholars will be able to afford them.
