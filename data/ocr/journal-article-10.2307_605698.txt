<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ARTICLES ENKI AND THE THEOLOGY OF ERIDU* WILLIAM W. HALLO YALE UNIVERSITY Three discrete ideologies may be identified in Sumer: the theologies of Nippur, Lagash, and Eridu. In focusing on the god Enki, the book under review provides the first systematic survey of the third of these theologies. That such a survey can be offered for one major Mesopotamian deity attests to the maturing of Assyriology. ANCIENT EGYTIAN RELIGION VIEWED THE WORLD through three discrete intellectual perspectives which modem Egyptologists have labeled the theologies of Thebes, Heliopolis, and Memphis.1 Similarly, the older Mesopotamian Weltanschauungen can be subsumed un- der three headings best described as the theologies of Nippur, Lagash, and Eridu.2 The first and oldest of these theologies centered upon Enlil, effectively the head of the Sumerian pantheon, and reflected conditions in Early Dynastic times, a per- iod when Nippur, Enlil's cult city, also served as the religious center of a league of all Sumer (Jacobsen's "Kengir League")3 and later, under the Sargonic and Ur III Dynasties, of Sumer and Akkad.4 It survived into * Review article of: Myths of Enki, the Crafty God.

Old Babylonian times when the First Dynasty of Isin tried to present itself as the heir to all Sumerian tradi- tions since the Flood. It was enshrined at this time in the Neo-Sumerian canon as fixed in the scribal schools, particularly at Nippur.s In addition to the hymns, lam- entations, and other genres on Enlil and/or his consort Ninlil (or Sud6 or even Ashnan7), the theology of Nip- pur is exemplified primarily in the Nippur recension of the Sumerian King List.8 The theology of Lagash revolved around Ningirsu, "the lord of Girsu," the capital city of the Lagash city- state, a leading actor in the outgoing Early Dynastic Period and once again in the late Sargonic Period. La- gash was dormant, if not actually suppressed, in the Ur III and early Isin Periods but surfaced once more under the Dynasty of Larsa thereafter. It is reflected in myths about Ninurta (who took Ningirsu's place in the Nippur curriculum9); in hymns to Ningirsu's consort Bau or to the goddess Nanshe who was "born in Eridu,"10 but 5 W. W.

His cult center was at Eridu, and Eridu was the oldest city in fact as well as in tradition (Sumerian, Akkadian, and even Hebrew14). It was thus possible to claim a hoary antiquity for this theology, though, in fact, it was proba- bly not systematized before the middle of the Old Baby- lonian Period and the rise to prominence of Babylon. Here Marduk, the local deity, was equated with Asar- lubi, the son of Enki, and turned, like his Sumerian prototype, into a patron of incantation and magic. The Sumerian flood story, in which Enki bests Enlil to assure the survival of humankind,15 was modified to provide a new antediluvian prologue, beginning with Eridu, to the Sumerian King List. A whole host of myths focusing on Enki developed the theme of his solicitude for humanity as a counterweight to the terror inspired by Enlil and his unalterable "word." The book under review speaks of a "theology of Ea" (p. 146). It does not operate with the notion of a "the- ology of Eridu," but it provides for the first time a sys- tematic survey of the Sumerian and Akkadian literary texts that go to make it up, i.e., the myths and other compositions about Enki/Ea.

Their respective roles are partially delineated in the introduc- tion (pp. 17f.). Maier is the coeditor of two volumes of essays on the Bible.'6 He is known to Assyriologists chiefly through his contribution to the second Kramer Festschrift'7 and through his collaboration with the poet John Gardner (and the Assyriologist Richard A. Henshaw) in the prep- aration of a new and rather imaginative rendition of the Gilgamesh Epic.18 He has also addressed the American Oriental Society on the subject of "Enki Speaks" (cf. p. 193) and has written on "Three Voices of Enki" (p. 244, n. 42).19 The present book is the outgrowth of these essays, according to the introduction, which seems to be at least in part Maier's. In the rest of the book, Kramer is responsible for the translation of all the Sumerian myths (chapters one through five) and other literary genres (chapter six), most of them more or less revised versions of his earlier editions. Many of these, in their time, were pioneering efforts that first revealed these compositions to the world of scholarship. Maier appears to be responsible for the translation and discussion of the later literary traditions about Enki/Ea in Sumero-Akkadian bilinguals and in other works in Akkadian, Hittite, Hebrew, Greek, and even beyond (chapters seven through nine). A final chap- ter (by Maier?) deals more generally with "myth and literature" (chapter ten). Between them, the authors have omitted relatively little of relevance. Of the secondary literature, one misses particularly the dissertation of Hannes D. Galter.20 Among the more notable textual omissions is the composition known by its ancient title (incipit) as nin-mul-an-gim, 16 The Bible in Its Literary Milieu: Contemporary Essays, ed. Vincent I. Tollers and John R. Maier (Grand Rapids: Eerd- mans, 1979); eidem, Mappings of the Biblical Terrain: The Bible as Text (Lewisburg, Pa.: Bucknell Univ. Press, 1990). 17 John R.

And the corpus of compositions has grown in the meantime with "A Litany for Enki."23 Secondary litera- ture about the deity since the book's appearance includes studies by Cooper,24 Limet,25 and Vogelzang.26 But even without these omissions and additions, Myths of Enki presents a rich feast. It serves as testimony to the maturing of Assyriology: the field has arrived at a new plateau when a comprehensive survey can be offered for the figure of a single Mesopotamian deity among the dozen major ones and the more than five thousand lesser ones that make up the Sumero-Akkadian pantheon.27 And when we recall that, in Mesopotamia, deification was the functional equivalent of generalization or of abstract con- ceptualization,28 then the equation of "the myths of Enki" with "the theology of Eridu" is not so farfetched. The following detailed comments may be added here.

One authority thinks so,31 but another places it in Afghanistan,32 and a third regards it as an essentially imaginary locale.33 Pp. 92-94: For "crafty" in this hymn (11. 1, 12, 20, 27) the original has galam, which Kramer (p. 237) equates with Akkadian naklu. Presumably this is the in- spiration for the title of the book. Sjoberg, in his original edition of the text, "Miscellaneous Sumerian Hymns," ZA 63 (1973): 40-48, translated galam by "clever" in 11. 1 and 12, by "surpassing" in 1. 20, and by "(accom- plishing) everything" in 1. 27 (for kin-galam-ma ak).

That Berossos' Oannes is derived from Sumerian u4-an-na (thus rather than uma-an-na) and is "none other than Adapa" has long been clear from the com- pound forms umun-a-da-pa,39 u4-an-na-a-da-pa,40 and u4-ma-da-num-a-da-pa.41 Pp. 138f.: "The exaltation of Kingu"-if this charac- terization of the passage in question is granted-pro- vides an interesting new example of "the typology of divine exaltation."42 The pericope occurs in the second chapter (tablet) of Enuma Elish, the composition con- ventionally known as the "Babylonian Epic of Creation," but which would be better entitled, "The Exaltation of Marduk" (cf. pp. 172f.).43 P. 145: The term nagbu, "everything," is not "ordi- narily 'groundwater' or 'depth'." Rather we may be deal- ing here with two homophones. The same ambiguity occurs in the opening line of the canonical version of Gilgamesh ("He Who Saw Everything") where, how- ever, Maier failed to note it, since he allowed Gardner (above, note 18) to translate there unambiguously "the one who saw the abyss."

P. 155: It is perhaps a bit surprising to see Sumerian influence claimed for Psalm 104, more often regarded as the biblical psalm most indebted to Egyptian models.45 P. 159: The concept of "intertextuality" was intro- duced to the literary criticism of cuneiform sources by Erica Reiner in 1985 and has been invoked by Assyri- ologists quite often since then.46 P. 161: While it is true that the biblical version of the Flood has no particular role for the flood-hero's wife and daughter, one may note the intertestamental tradition that made the first sibyl a daughter-in-law of Noah. For post- biblical traditions about Noah's wife, see pp. 162-65. P. 189: The reference here and on pp. 193f. is to the text translated by Kramer on pp. 77-82 and transliterated by him on pp. 228-31.
