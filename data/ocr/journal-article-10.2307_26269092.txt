Forests as Patrimonies? From Theory to Tangible Processes at Various Scales Genevieve Michon 1, Bruno Romagny 2, Laurent Auclair 2, and Marc Deconchat 3 ABSTRACT. Among theoretical fields addressing the conceptualization of interrelationships between nature and society, patrimonial approaches remain relatively unexplored. Stressing the multiplication of local dynamics where elements of nature are redefined as "patrimonies" (ranging from local patrimonies to world heritage) by various social groups, this conceptual field tries to qualify these dynamics and their determiners to understand how they allow us to better address contemporary environmental challenges. Through a multidisciplinary approach in social sciences, centered on rural forests, we analyze the multiplication of patrimonial processes in forest development at various scales. First, we elaborate on the concept of patrimony and on patrimonial processes and present the current construction and dynamics of forest patrimonies. A crucial question concerns the links that form between the many spatial–temporal levels where these processes develop. Moreover, these patrimonial processes can be quite divergent, not only across scales from local to global, but also between “endogenous” (or bottom-up) and “exogenous” (or top-down) processes. We present two detailed examples in Morocco and Sumatra, where patrimonial constructions are developing simultaneously at various scales and through various actors who treat the forest in very different ways. Drawing from these examples, we discuss how and why the simultaneous development of different, often overlapping, patrimonial constructions along these scales allows collaboration or, conversely, can lead their holders into conflict. Lastly, we discuss the contribution of patrimonial concepts to resilience thinking and social–ecological systems theory. Key Words: international policies; local forest management; patrimonial processes and approaches INTRODUCTION and further developed by other scholars in the social sciences. Among theoretical fields addressing the conceptualization of For Ollagnon, patrimony refers to “the compendium of all interrelationships between nature and society, patrimonial material and immaterial elements that help maintain and approaches (Barthélemy and Nieddu 2007, Calvo-Mendieta develop, by adaptation in an evolutionary context, the identity et al. 2011) remain relatively unexplored, at least at an and autonomy of its holder, through time and space” (Ollagnon international level and for English-speaking scholars. 1979). For Ollagnon’s followers, the term also refers to “a set Patrimonial approaches have traditionally been developed by of material and symbolic elements which allow a human community to anchor itself in space and time” (Nieddu et al. scholars working in the fields of private law, architectural 2009). Patrimony is also something that “binds people” monuments, and culture. For a few decades now, patrimony and patrimonial processes have been redefined and (Micoud and Peroni 2000), it is therefore the expression of apeculiar type of social relationship integrating elements of appropriated as meaningful analytical categories by other human natural and cultural environments. When it applies to nature,and social sciences such as sociology, anthropology, geography, it also refers to a peculiar type of nature–society relationship. or economics in order to highlight new trends in the relationship between societies and their “natures.” As well as patrimony, we also elaborate on “patrimonialization Stressing the multiplication of local dynamics, where elements of nature,” which refers to processes of social, cultural, and of nature are redefined as “patrimonies” by various social political construction through which elements of nature are groups (from local communities to international agencies), incorporated into a heritage at either local, national, or this conceptual field tries to qualify these dynamics and their international levels.

We present the dimensions of forest Our paper discusses the relevancy of these patrimonial patrimonies at various scales. Drawing from two contrasting examples, we then discuss how and why the simultaneous concepts for analyzing the dynamics of forest–society relationships.

Elements of Definition Patrimonial approaches in the field of social–environmental A patrimony is a set of material or immaterial elements to relationships, therefore, push purely environmental issues which are attached specific values and rights that are linked aside in order to focus on more social and political issues, to a social group and are inherited and transmitted from one considering that problems in resource management are mainly generation to the next. The term “patrimony” is equivalent to problems of relationships among actors about how to access “heritage” in English. Even though “heritage” is more and use resources. This somehow relates to common-property commonly used, we have chosen to keep the term “patrimony” approaches (Ostrom 1990), but patrimonial approaches in order to refer to the above-mentioned school of thought. concentrate less on institutions and more on the various modes of resource appropriation (from management practices to Patrimony was formerly considered to be merely a collection of objects rules), coordination, negotiation, and collective action forand values managed for transmission (Handler 1987) conflict resolution (Weber 1996). Scholarly approaches toand classical economic definitions still tend to reduce patrimony also involve highlighting different processes of patrimony to capital (Vivien 2009). The definition proposed patrimonial construction—or destruction—for a given by Ollagnon emphasizes the idea of identity and autonomy of resource. Analyzing resource management through the lens of the holders, which incorporates social qualities and carries a patrimony also involves demonstrating how a given resource sociopolitical overtone. This new concept of patrimony insists and associated practices help maintain and develop the identity on intergenerational solidarity and collective action as and autonomy of its holder. inherent qualities of patrimony: patrimony is defined by elements that are “collectively selected as deserving to be Patrimony in Action-Focused Approaches and Public transmitted from the past in order to find a value in the present” Policies (Lazzarotti 2003). It also incorporates a high sense of Patrimony and patrimonial approaches are not only intergenerational responsibility: inheriting, managing, and exploratory concepts or theoretical positions mobilized by transmitting a patrimony is not only a right or a privilege, but social sciences for the study of social–environmental relations. also involves duties. Through these social perspectives, They also refer to tangible processes of social, cultural, and patrimony becomes a “tool for coordination” (Micoud 2000) political construction in which related individuals, at various or “a set of symbolic and material elements that confer spatial scales (local, national, international), select elements of their and temporal meaning to a human community” and is “devoted common past and designate them as essential for their to the preservation and perpetuation of the social group to collective future and, in doing so, form themselves into a which it is attached” (Nieddu et al. 2009). In these community with specific sociopolitical objectives. Beyond the perspectives, patrimony covers complex and diverse elements, local scale, where it is easy to define the holders of a given situations, and processes and is clearly linked to special types patrimony, these processes encompass a set of action-focused of social relationships and social meaning. The concept has approaches and public policies conducted in the name of been appropriated by various disciplines in the social sciences: collective and intergenerational interest in order to conserve from law and economics to anthropology, sociology, elements (of architecture, culture, nature) seen as emblematic ethnology, and geography. More recently, it has entered into for a large—and often vague—community: nation, humanity. debates and actions related to nature, biodiversity, and local We call all these processes “patrimonialization.” knowledge (Cormier Salem et al. 2002, 2005), which has led Patrimonialization of forest and biodiversity, and more to the emergence of a major theoretical field in natural resource recently of traditional knowledge, is becoming one of the main management: patrimonial approaches. strategies for sustainable development and conservation For Ollagnon, the main concern of patrimonial approaches is policies.  what binds a patrimony and its holder(s) together, which Cormier-Salem and her colleagues, on their synthetic work on implies that maintaining and developing someone’s identity nature patrimonialization, have defined two broad categories and autonomy constitutes an issue by itself. In a convergent of processes that relate to two different concepts of what a analysis, Cormier-Salem has proposed relating the patrimonial patrimony is and who defines it (Cormier-Salem et al. 2002, status of a resource management system to three 2005). The first category concerns “exogenous” or top-down interdependent elements (Cormier-Salem et al. 2002): processes.

Transmitting this patrimonial construction that often holds loose reference to patrimony from one generation to the next, as well as the conservation. These processes are grounded in a collective values, status, and rights attached to it, constitutes the warrant attachment to significant elements that relate wholly to local of economic and social sustainability. In this sense, patrimony histories and representations of nature–society relationships relates to resilience, as Auclair et al.
