Along with Barry Kemp of Cam- bridge University, an Egyptologist, he comes at a time when a critical examination of the often hurriedly conducted excavations of the prewar years is in order. The volume under review is a thorough catalog and examination of anthropomorphic figures (why figurines?) from predynastic Egypt and neolithic Crete. It is a well-reasoned exposition with exemplary attention to their context and possible func- tions. Omitted is a group of ivory figures from Egypt dealt with elsewhere by Ucko ("Anthro- pomorphic Ivory Figurines from Egypt," Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 92, 1965). Ethnography is brought to bear on the subject in a meaningful way; see how Ucko's recent considerations on the role of ethnography ("Ethnography and Archaeolog- ical Interpretation of Funerary Remains," World Archaeology 1:262-280, 1969). The main thrust of Ucko's conclusions lies in his opting for a multivariate approach to the function of the human (and animal) figures and a corresponding rejection of their possible/ exclusive bearing on the cult of a mother god- dess. Valuable as his arguments are, one cannot help but feel that the mother goddess interpre- tation has had few adherents in recent years. The multifunctional approach seems quite valid: "The view of a few archaeologists... that one single interpretation of all anthro- pomorphic figurines from one area and site is likely to camouflage several different functions that they might have had is strongly supported by the ethnographic and historic evidence pre- sented in this chapter" (p. 426). Among the functions suggested for the Egyptian figures are those of playthings, vehicles of sympa- thetic magic, ex-votos, didactic illustrations from previous initiation rites, deceased twins, and sorcerer's agents. This list reflects a reading of the ethnography of diverse cultures; one might object to a lack of consideration of the literature and magical texts of a slightly later date from Egypt. For Crete the possibilities are probably restricted to dolls, initiation figures, and vehicles for sympathetic magic. In his treatment of the material from Crete, Ucko is scrupulous in using the most recent material from the site notebooks that chal- lenges the evidence of Evans's excavation re- ports. The "concubines of the dead" theory for Egyptian figures is almost, if not quite, laid to rest by Ucko's demonstration of their frequent presence in habitation sites, their as- sociation with animal figures, and the lack of a clear correlation of "opposite sex" figures when the sex of the burial was determined. None of these factors, however, rules out this interpretation to my mind. A valuable and valid conclusion reached by Ucko is his rejection of steatopygia as a fea- ture of these figures, the cases being explained for the most part as a beauty feature or as representations with the legs drawn under. Here he might have noted a passage in the Ramesside love songs in which a beautiful girl is described as having drooping buttocks and a small waist, and the representation of such a girl in the three-quarter rear view of a servant in the Dynasty 18 tomb of Rekhmire. Both text and representation postdate the material represented by the figures in Ucko's catalog. Yet the literary, representational material, and cultural evidence from dynastic Egypt, with all due caution, deserve to be considered as well as modern ethnographic parallels from Africa and elsewhere. One might note Brunner-Traut's interpretation of the relief of the Queen of Punt (Dynasty 18) as representing not steato- pygia but pseudohypertrophic muscular dys- trophy ("Die Krankheit der Fuirstin von Punt," Die Welt des Orients 2:307-311, 1957). See also Paul Ghalioungui on this subject (Annales du Service des Antiquiti's de l'Egypte 49:303- 316, 1949). In pointing these matters out, I must confess to identifying my own bias or standpoint, which is that of the Egyptologist. The author expresses his lack of conviction about any relationship between the figures he has studied and the Beersheba material studied by Parrot. There is an almost total lack of appreciation of the artistic merits of the few outstanding examples. Granted that the art historical, cura- torial approach has produced little of merit in this field and that the curators have been duped by forgeries (analyzed elsewhere by Ucko), there is still room for an aesthetic as well as a functional approach. In brief, the catalog is admirable for the analysis and typology of the objects themselves as well as for the conclusions reached. If one cannot be fired by the subject, one must ad- mire the careful treatment accorded it.</page></plain_text>
