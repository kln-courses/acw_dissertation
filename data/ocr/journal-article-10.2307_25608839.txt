<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ancient Maya sculptures of Tikal, seen and unseen MEGAN E. O'NEIL This article addresses the ancient Maya practice of burying monumental stone sculptures, including stelae, altars, and other sculptural forms. In particular, I explore why and how the ancient Maya buried sculptures and sculpture fragments, if the sculptures continued to have meaning outside the mode of the visible, and what they did once buried. I argue that some sculptures performed during the act of burial or once buried, whether to sanctify buildings, transfer their power to newer buildings or sculptures, or make connections with ancestors. The buried objects, I argue, were intended? and perceived?to be present, similar to an ancestor or deity that could not be seen but was known to exist through signs, surrogates, or other perceptual modes. In fact, this investigation offers further evidence that vision was not the only operative mode influencing the creation and use of ancient Maya monumental sculpture.1 This article addresses buried sculptures from Tikal (Peten, Guatemala), although it is part of a larger project concerning ancient Maya treatment of sculptures across multiple sites?including Uaxactun, Caracol, Calakmul, Piedras Negras, and Copan?and across time.2 Research for this article was supported by a J. Raul Getty Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship and an Advancing Scholarship in the Humanities and Social Sciences award from the University of Southern California. Special thanks to Dr. Hector Escobedo of Guatemala's Instituto de Antropologfa e Historia for granting permission to photograph the sculptures atTikal, to Licenciado Juan Carlos Melendez for his support in the Museo Nacional de Arqueologi'a y Etnologfa, and to Arqueologo Oswaldo Gomez, Arqueologo Marco Tulio Castellanos, and the staff of the Museo Sylvanus Morley and the Museo Litica for their kindness and assistance in the Parque Nacional Tikal. I am also grateful for the helpful comments of Dr. Francesco Pellizzi, Dr. Stephen Houston, and an anonymous reviewer. 1. Although the study of sculptures' visibility has been a dominant mode in the study of ancient Maya sculptures, some studies have focused on other reasons for their production and use. For example, David Stuart and Stephen Houston (Stuart 1996; Houston and Stuart 1998) have argued that Maya stelae functioned as avatars that would hold a part of the depicted person's soul. 2. The working title for this project is "The Lives of Ancient Maya Sculptures" (O'Neil n.d.). Other studies concerning ancient Maya sculptural modifications and movements are Satterthwaite (1958); Houston and Stuart (1998); Martin (2000); Just (2005); and Mesick (2006). Visibility and presence In the stories of the Hero Twins in the Quiche Maya Popol Vuh, visibility and invisibility are important paradigms in the mythical twins' communication with and journeys to Xibalba, the Maya Underworld. Earth and Xibalba are parallel worlds that cannot be seen from either location, though sound and visible signs provide connections between them. For example, when the first set of twins?One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu? played ball on earth, the Xibalban Lords could not see them but could hear them, and the twins' stomping and shouting disturbed the Xibalbans. The Xibalbans challenged the twins to descend to Xibalba, and there? tragically?the twins were defeated. The next set of twins?Hunahpu and Xbalanque, sons of One Hunahpu?found their father's ball, and their stomping and shouting again disturbed the Xibalbans, who challenged the twins to descend to Xibalba. Upon their departure from earth, in an effort to soothe their grandmother's fears that they too would die, Hunahpu and Xbalanque left a sign for her, planting ears of maize in the center of her house that would sprout and wither in tandem with their life states (Christenson 2003:160). Although in Xibalba, where they could not be seen, visible signs would reflect their state of being to those on earth. As the Xibalbans challenged the Hero Twins, the maize sprouted, withered, and sprouted again, and all the while the grandmother watched and burned copal before them. In this story, cycles of growing and withering corn function as metaphors for life, death, and rebirth. In addition, the maize ears are signs reflecting actions that are unseen but are known to be happening in a parallel realm. This passage is one of many examples of sensitivity to and exploration of the line between the visible and invisible in Maya culture, past and present. Vision, although of great import, is only one mode of perception, among others; and beings?even if unseen? can be considered present and perceived through modes other than sight, whether through hearing, through signs that marked and reflected their existence and behavior, through dreams, or through memory. The ancient Maya explored the boundary between the visible and invisible in a number of ways, including using representational media to make visible what was normally invisible, particularly in the depiction of</page><page sequence="2">120 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 ancestors and other deities. Ancestors often were depicted in quatrefoil cartouches that materialized portals between human and ancestral worlds, these portals showing that ancestors inhabited a realm parallel to the human world. Depiction of deities also made visible the invisible, giving what could be felt or perceived a visible state, such as the lightning deity Chahk in his anthropomorphic form, brandishing the stone axe he used to create lightning (fig. 1). Although people could perceive Chahk's presence through flashes of lightning, Chahk as an anthropomorphic being was not visible, except when represented in artistic media or impersonated by a priest or dancer. Such visible manifestations?particularly in scenes showing glimpses to other realms?may have suggested that what was invisible was always present, ready to come to the surface, to be brought forward through representation or ritual. Visibility and display were crucial aspects of the production and reception of ancient Maya sculptures, but examination of sculptures' compositions and placements?both at initial dedications and later in their life histories?suggests that through them the boundary between the visible and the invisible was exploited and explored. For instance, carvings on the backs of monuments?depending on placement and accessibility?remained unseen to many. And no one could see the carving on the tops of tall monuments, except ancestors or deities in the celestial realm (Houston, Escobedo, and Webster n.d.:2-3). Furthermore, placement of monuments in small shrines limited viewership, and glimpses of them may have reified the denial of accessibility, highlighting the power that lay at the boundary between visibility and invisibility. Lastly, the practice of burying sculptures made them invisible and inaccessible to all. Nevertheless, I argue that buried sculptures often continued to perform, both within and outside the realm of human perception. Evidence strongly suggests that buried sculptures were remembered and intended to have an effect on what existed around them and what was visible above them, comparable to the Hero Twins' life state affecting the condition of maize on earth. Nonetheless, although I privilege this line between visible and invisible, the sculptures' presence, materiality, and sacrality were of utmost importance. Pakal's interred sarcophagus Few Maya sculptures were made for burial. One is the carved sarcophagus of K'inich Janaab Rakal, who ruled P&amp;lenque (Chiapas, Mexico) from a.d. 615 to 683. The sarcophagus lid's representation of Pakal as the maize god falling into and rising out of the Underworld portrayed what the Maya believed about the deceased ruler and the events taking place after death (see Scheie and Mathews 1998:fig. 3.16).3 Pakal's travel to the Underworld and his rebirth along the World Tree were a journey of his spirit that ostensibly happened but could not be seen; nevertheless, the carved image makes manifest this transformative voyage, making it visible and also causing this journey by materializing it. Pakal's sarcophagus was buried soon after its creation, its imagery denied to humans. Nevertheless, the materialization of its transformative processes performed outside the visible mode, functioning as a container for Pakal's remains and a vehicle for his rebirth. Moreover, in the natural world there were visible signs that reflected this occurrence, including the withering and sprouting maize ears in the agricultural fields, which gave signs that the ruler?and the maize god?were reborn, and when one saw maize sprouting, more was happening than could be seen. The building where the sarcophagus was interred?the Temple of Inscriptions?was a locus for remembrance and communication with Pakal. Evidence is in the sanctuary's carved panels, whose texts recounted episodes in Pakal's life and connections to his past; the psychoduct, which snaked up the pyramid's inner stairs and enabled communication between the sanctuary and burial chamber; and the sanctuary, where the Maya performed rituals to Pakal. In addition, the sarcophagus likely continued to act within memory, remembered perhaps not with absolute specificity of what it narrated, but for what it was, and what it did, particularly as the vehicle for Pakal's rebirth. Moreover, Pakal was kept within memory and representation elsewhere at Palenque, for even after his death in a.d. 683, his descendants depicted him in sculptures, including the Palace Tablet of a.d. 720 and the Temple XXI Panel of a.d. 736, which showed him to have a continuing, active role in politics and ceremony. The lives of buried sculptures Pakal's sarcophagus is somewhat anomalous in ancient Maya culture, for the Maya placed most stone sculptures on view after their creation. However, after initial displays, the Maya treated sculptures in a variety of 3. Many scholars have described the imagery on Rakal's sarcophagus lid. For one detailed description?and interpretation?of the image's constituent parts, see Scheie and Mathews (1998:110-119).</page><page sequence="3">O'Neil: Ancient Maya sculptures of Tikal, seen and unseen 121 Figure 1.

They left some on view in their original locations; they moved others to new places in the polity; they dragged some to other polities as war booty; and they buried others. Nearly all the sculptures that the Maya buried had previous iterations as displayed monuments, buried as secondary or other phases of their life histories. Nevertheless, many continued to perform after burial. Most buried sculptures were broken before burial. The breakage runs the gamut, from accidental to intentional, from reverential to desecratory, and burial appears to be one of several choices of what to do with broken monuments, for the Maya placed other broken monuments on view in new settings. Buried sculptures and sculptural fragments appear in a variety of contexts, some reused as construction material, others buried with great care in symbolic locations. Fragments used as construction fill were not placed in explicitly meaningful places, and the Maya did not necessarily keep pieces of the same sculpture together. At Tikai, for example, archaeologists discovered numerous fragments in construction fill, jumbled with rubble, with no evident symbolism in their placement.4 Nevertheless, they still performed an important function, for they enabled the construction of Tikal's towering temples. Alternatively, across the Maya realm, the Maya buried broken and whole sculptures in significant locations, collecting the fragments and burying them together, some as if they were human bodies. They interred them at the bases of other monuments, in altars or small platforms, or in pyramids, frequently in special cache deposits. They buried some sculptures where they had 4. Some are fragments of substantial size, though others were so small that archaeologists could not identify the original whole and catalogued them as "Miscellaneous Stones." University of Pennsylvania archaeologists found 166 miscellaneous stones at Tikal, though some were later connected to named monuments. Archaeologists have found broken sculptures used as construction material at other sites, including Altar de Sacrificios, Calakmul, Copan, Piedras Negras, and Uaxactun.</page><page sequence="4">122 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 been displayed and moved others to new locations for burial. With many, we can see meaning in their treatment, for the Maya buried them such that their movement to an invisible mode did not necessarily entail a forgetting of them or a neutralization of their power to act. Among other motivations, the reverential interment of a broken sculpture was a way to put a damaged sculpture to rest. By burying the sculpture, the Maya preserved the remaining dignity or sacrality of a destroyed sculpture and the person it depicted or embodied. Regardless, this motivation complemented others, for sculptures often simultaneously functioned as offerings to other sculptures, buildings, or graves. In fact, my survey of buried sculptures across multiple Maya sites makes clear that the practice of burying sculptures was not simply a disposal mechanism for objects whose use-life had ended, for their burials gave them new life and meaning in relationship to the entities to which they were offered. This is apparent not only in the fact that whole sculptures were buried, but also in the way the Maya treated them, caching them in dedicatory cists or chambers beneath standing sculptures or at temple centers. And in these new locations, they entered other phases in their life histories, taking on roles relevant not only in the realm of human perception?in the intention and witness of burial, and in memory of them?but also outside human perception, performing through their presence and materiality. The ancient Maya buried sculptures and fragments beneath other sculptures (as at Copan), but the burial of sculptures and sculptural fragments within buildings is the largest, most varied subset of ancient Maya sculpture interment, occurring atTikal, Uaxactun, Caracol, Copan, Piedras Negras, and elsewhere, and there are parallels in these practices across sites. In particular, the ancient Maya often interred sculptures on pyramids' central axes, at times at the pyramid's center or in the superstructure's back room, locations similar to where the Maya cached other materials (Mock 1998:6). Furthermore, there are multiple examples in which the buried sculpture is in close relation to a human burial, and others in which the sculpture?usually a stela?is treated as if it were a human body. We may conceptualize ancient Maya practices of burying sculptures within a larger context of cached offerings, a common practice related to building and sculpture dedication and termination.5 For example, dedicating houses by burying something at the center was common for ancient Maya buildings, with parallels in modern Maya rituals. For example, Evon Vogt (1976:51-55; 1998:21-23) has described house dedication and ensoulment rituals of theTzotzil Maya of Zinacantan (Chiapas, Mexico) that include the burial of roosters and chickens in a hole at the house's center; these rituals also consisted of lit candles, processions, and prayers.6 According to Vogt (1998:21), the ceremonies give the house a c'u/e/or ch'ulel?an "inner soul"?so that it becomes "a part of living Zinacanteco society." Ancient building dedications appear to have followed patterns analogous to modern Zinacanteco house dedications. In addition to the commonality of burying offerings at buildings' centers, the fires that blackened ancient temple walls and floors are analogous to candles burned in Zinacantan, and the ancient Maya also may have perceived their dedication of caches on buildings' centers and central axes as giving their houses ch'ulel. Furthermore, Shirley Boteler Mock has suggested that ancient practices of caching objects and burying buildings inside new ones transferred the ch'ulel of older objects and buildings into the new structures, the ch'ulel "reincarnated through offerings in each new 'descendant' building episode" (Mock 1998:11).7 When stone sculptures and fragments were buried in important locations, what about the sculptures was salient in their burial? Was it their carvings, whether image or text? Or their patronage? In reviewing the range of cases, it appears that image, text, and patronage frequently did matter in the choice of which sculptures the Maya chose for special or symbolic burials. However, once sculptures were buried, the opportunity for reception of sculptures' particularities was reduced, and memory of the sculpture?if any?likely was of the object itself, as opposed to specific details. In other words, sculptures' images or inscriptions may have been important in selecting them to receive special treatment, but when buried, their meaning was transformed. 5. Shirley Boteler Mock (1998:6) notes that other common places for ancient dedication and termination caches are at "interstices of structures/' including stairways, axial centers, boundaries, doorways, and corners. Multiple articles in The Sowing and the Dawning, edited by Mock (1998), discuss Mesoamerican caching and other offering practices. 6. The house dedication rites are in two parts: the hoi chuk ("binding the head of the roof") ceremony, which happens when the walls and rafters have been built, and the ch'ul kantela ("holy candle") ritual, which takes place after construction is complete. 7. Bryan Just has also discussed the burial of sculptures and buildings in new architectural phases. Citing Mock, he discusses the interment of sculptures and buildings within a context of "transferral," arguing that such interments "contributed their accrued potency to the new structure" (Just 2005:70).</page><page sequence="5">O'Neil: Ancient Maya sculptures of Tikal, seen and unseen 123 Str. 5D-23-lst-A str 5D_29 \Nv Str. 5D-34-lst J Str. 5D-30 \^\ Str. 5D-33-2nd j Figure 2.

Nevertheless, even without the specificity of their carvings available, the fact that they had come out of the past may have been known. Even so, analysis of these burials demonstrates that the materiality of the monuments was a crucial part of their continued meaning, particularly in their operation in material and symbolic realms outside of human perception. For example, one aspect may have been the transfer of ch'ulel from one object to another, which took place because of what the materials were and where they existed in relation to one another. Another aspect was their potential to make eternal an ephemeral ceremony?either because the sculpture's deposition took place within a ceremony, because its physical form replicated the ceremony, or because it retained traces of ceremonial burning or breakage. The materiality and positioning of cached objects would have continued the performance of rituals that sanctified them, the sculptures' physical states materializing that ceremony. Stelae cached in buildings: Tikal Excavations conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Tikal Archaeological Project (1956-1970) and the Proyecto Nacional Tikal (PNT) of Guatemala's Instituto de Antropologia e Historia (1979-1985) uncovered examples of monuments buried in significant and meaningful locations within buildings. These locations generally are on buildings' central axes, often in a superstructure's back room, and frequently in relation to a tomb. Most were broken, and a major motivation for the interments may have been to put the sculptures to rest, protecting and revering them as if they were human bodies. Even so, interred sculptures functioned as offerings to buildings, tombs, and ancestors, and burning rituals often accompanied and followed the interments. Because of the way the ancient Maya treated these sculptures, it is clear they perceived them to be sacred, powerful objects deserving of special treatment. Stela 26 The Tikal Maya buried several broken Early Classic stelae?Stelae 26, 31, and 40?in North Acropolis temples (fig. 2). Stela 26 originally depicted a standing ruler on the front, with texts on its sides. The front figure had been severely damaged, but parts of its side texts are well preserved and include the names of ancestors (fig. 3). Stela 26 appears to have been a monument of</page><page sequence="6">124 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 Figure 3. Tikal Stela 26, 1958. William R. Coe, University of Pennsylvania Tikal Project Negative 58-4-1467 ? University of Pennsylvania Museum. ChakTok Ich'aak I, a Tikal ruler from the mid- to late fourth century who may have been assassinated when theTeotihuacan-affiliated regime entered Tikal in a.d. 378, installing Yax Nuun Ahiin I as ruler of Tikal (Martin and Grube 2008:28-30; Stuart 2000:472-481; Martin 2003:12-13, 17).8The damage to Stela 26 was clearly deliberate (Coe 1990:745), and the new regime may have broken this stela and others as a way of desecrating ChakTok Ich'aak's public symbols.9 Nevertheless, in the late seventh century, the Maya set Stela 26's largest fragment?its basal fragment?in the center of the back room of the shrine at the top of Structure 5D-34-1st in the North Acropolis, which already contained Burial 10, likely Yax Nuun Ahiin's tomb (Coggins 1975:145-146; Coe 1990:479-487, 505).10 They planted the fragment in a hole cut through a floor blackened by fires, evidence that the room already had been a site for burning rituals?perhaps to Yax Nuun Ahiin. Furthermore, the pit that sustained the fragment was filled with obsidian and flint flakes and charcoal (Coe 1990:475, 498), materials left over, perhaps, from ceremonies in the shrine. After reerecting the Stela 26 fragment, the Maya built a masonry altar around it, into which they placed other fragments of the stela and other materials (see Coe 1990:fig. 158; fig. 4 in this article).11 The stela thereby became invisible within its altar, and the Maya continued to use the room, performing more fire rituals and depositing offerings in the shrine. Evidence of continued fire ceremonies includes blackened plaster on the altar and a 5-6 centimeter layer of charcoal and ash on the floor of Room 3.12 In addition, there were two caches of charcoal?one of five pounds, predominantly from pines?deposited in the floor before the altar and buried stela. These ash and charcoal deposits were radiocarbon dated to the late eighth or early ninth centuries (ibid.: 476, 498-499, 503). Furthermore, the Maya buried more caches in the floors of Rooms 2 and 3 and scattered "smashed pots, drums, and censers" that were "intermingled with charcoal" in Room 3. Also scattered in Room 3 were items that Coe suggests came from inside the altar, including stone fragments (MS 2 and 137) that may have been part of Stela 26, dispersed when the Maya broke open the altar at a later date (ibid.:490-501). The charcoal layer on the shrine floor, the charcoal caches in the floor, and the smashed vessels and censers intermingled with charcoal are examples of ceremonial trash, remains of offerings performed in the sanctuary 8. Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube suggest the depicted person was ChakTok Ich'aak I, because his name appears at the end of the text on the right side. The text on the left side includes names of deities and rulers from the early part of the Early Classic (Martin and Grube 2008:28; Grube and Martin n.d.:42-43). All transliterations of rulers' names in this article are from Martin and Grube (2008). 9. In fact, Martin (2003:15) observes that there are no pre-378 monuments found at Tikal that were not broken. There were other episodes of monument destruction, though, for later sculptures were broken, including Stelae 31 and 40, which had to have been broken after their dedications in a.d. 445 and 468, perhaps in 562 ce. when Calakmul defeated Tikal. Jones and Satterthwaite (1982:117) also note Tikal monument destruction from earlier than the fourth century (see also Jones 1991). 10. The Maya also interred Burial 8 in Temple 34, but this tomb was reentered and ravaged in the ancient past (Coe 1990:487-490). 11. Based on radiocarbon dates, comparisons with Structure 33, and other evidence, Coe (ibid.: 745, 505) hypothesized that Stela 26 was buried ca. a.d. 652-672. 12. Coe suggested this ash mound may have come from burning on top of the altar, swept to the floor when the altar was broken open, its contents spread across the room. The radiocarbon date range for this deposit was a.d. 740-880 (ibid.: 476, 503).</page><page sequence="7">O'Neil: Ancient Maya sculptures of Tikal, seen and unseen 125 ^^^^^^^^^^^^ Figure 4.

University of Pennsylvania Museum. and potentially considered sacred because they resulted from ceremonial action.13 As a severely broken sculpture, the original historical specificity of the Stela 26 image and text was significantly reduced, yet the stela's interment and the continued offerings and fire ceremonies suggest that people perceived the stone to hold power and sacredness. Whereas the whole stela may have embodied ChakTok Ich'aak I, the broken stela may have embodied his memory, the stone perceived as important precisely because of the connection to this ancestor. Alternatively, they may have revered the stela as a relic of the past and ancestors in a broader sense because of its text naming earlier ancestors. Regardless, once buried, the reception of the specificity was diminished even further, for none of the stela could be seen. Nevertheless, this did not neutralize its power, for it continued to be a focus of ritual and offerings. Even unseen, it was remembered 13. The term "ceremonial trash" encompasses materials left over from ceremonies, which may have required special treatment such as deposition in a sacred location (see O'Neil n.d.). and worshiped as a proximate, tangible locus of contact with ancestors. Moreover, even outside modes of human perception or remembrance, the Stela 26 caching may have served to transfer the monument's ch'ulel and the sacredness accrued from burning and other ceremonies into this structure. It is clear that the Maya buried Stela 26 in a highly sacred location and performed ceremonies to it before, during, and after burial. The archaeological remains surrounding this stela give a glimpse into the human experience within this sanctuary, of the heat from fires burning the face, the smoke clouding the eyes, the pine aromas gracing the nose, the sounds of pine burning with its characteristic crackles and pops, the sounds of censers and other ceramic vessels being smashed, together stimulating multiple human senses and complementing memories recalled or retold of the ancestor and the object, such that the realms of the visible and invisible, the tangible and intangible, and multiple corporeal senses would have come together for a powerful sensorial and religious experience. Stela 31 The largest fragment of Tikal Stela 31 was also reset amidst intense ceremony in an Early Classic temple shrine, Structure 5D-33-2nd, the funerary pyramid of Sihyaj Chan K'awiil II, who ruled from a.d. 411 to 456 (Martin and Grube 2008:34). Dated to 9.0.10.0.0 (October 16, a.d. 445), Stela 31 is carved on all four sides: on the front is Sihyaj Chan K'awiil, and the monument's sides bear images of his father?Yax Nuun Ahiin?dressed as aTeotihuacan warrior (fig. 5). On the back is an inscription narrating a series of period endings?beginning in the fourth century and ending with the stela's dedication?and unique events related to theTeotihuacan incursion, including the Sihyaj K'ahk's arrival, ChakTok Ich'aak I's death in a.d. 378, and Spearthrower Owl's death in a.d. 439 (Stuart 2000: 482-483). The ancient Maya mutilated the three human faces on Stela 31 by chipping, but this damage is minor and common on Maya stelae and may have served to release the monument's soul or prevent it from seeing or breathing (Houston and Stuart 1998:88; Just 2005:78). In contrast, the stela's bottom was broken off, a more extreme type of damage, and this broken edge was burned (Coe 1990:757). Later, the ancient Maya reset the broken Stela 31 in the Structure 5D-33-2nd shrine, and subsequently they interred this structure in a larger building phase, Structure 5D-33-1st, most likely in the</page><page sequence="8">126 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 Figure 5. Tikal Stela 31 (front), Maya, a.d. 445. Limestone. Museo Sylvanus G. Morley, Parque Nacional Tikal. Photograph by the author. second half of the seventh century or the early eighth century.14 There is evidence of burning rituals before, during, and after the enshrinement and interment of Stela 31 and its sanctuary. Like Stela 26, the broken Stela 31 was planted in a pit dug through the already blackened floor of the shrine's back room, blackened from fires that may have been offered to Burial 48, Sihyaj Chan K'awiil's tomb. Archaeologists also found monument fragments, many of them burned, on the Room 2 sanctuary floor in a layer of "black-brown dirt interspersed by charcoal, sherds, and censer parts" that "significantly covered the Stela 31 pit's patchwork" (ibid.:513).15 Containing charcoal and censer parts, this is ceremonial trash, likely accumulated during ceremonies within the sanctuary. Additional evidence for ceremonies was a mound of ash and charcoal (5-10 cm thick) in the northwest corner of the chamber (ibid.), comparable to the mound of charcoal and ash in Temple 34. After burying Stela 31 and its shrine in the Temple 33-1 st building phase, the ancient Maya performed more ceremonies in the new shrine, directed most likely to Sihyaj Chan K'awiil, present and embodied in Stela 31 and his corporeal remains, both of which were buried in the temple. Evidence for fire rituals performed in the Temple 33-1 st shrine includes an annular stain?perhaps from a censer?on one phase of the Room 2 floor, charring on the central part of all phases of floors, and remains of soot reaching 1.50 m at the center of the rear wall of the 33-1 st shrine (ibid.:534). 14. This date range coincides with the end of the Hiatus?a troubled time for Tikal after its defeat by Calakmul?or during the reign of Jasaw Chan K'awiil (reign dates: 682-734), who dedicated the first extant stone monument after the Hiatus (Martin and Grube 2008:39 45). Coe (1990:759) suggests a.d. 652-672, during the Hiatus. Jones and Satterthwaite (1982:64) suggest it happened during the transition from Ik to Imix ceramics?at the end of the Hiatus or in Jasaw Chan K'awiil's reign. Alternatively, Clemency Coggins (1975:188) suggests it happened in the beginning of Jasaw Chan K'awiil's reign?after 682?and was symbolic of the polity's restoration. 15. These included MS 19, five burned fragments; MS 40, an uncarved fragment; MS 43, small carved burned fragments; and MS 44, more limestone fragments, many "discolored, as if from burning." Some fragments in the stela pit and in Room 2 may be from Stela 31, resulting from the stela's mutilation in the shrine (Coe 1990:761; Jones and Satterthwaite 1982:89). In addition, in the pit supporting Stela 31 were a fragment of Stela 37 and twenty-eight other limestone fragments (ibid.:64, 77; Coe 1990:512, 756, 760). They may have been used simply for the quality of stone, to keep the reset stela upright; though mixed with charcoal, ceramic censer parts, and pieces of architectural stucco, they may have come from burning ceremonies and architecture termination rituals. These materials thus may have been ceremonial trash, and the Maya may have considered them as offerings to the stela in its resetting.</page><page sequence="9">O'Neil: Ancient Maya sculptures of Tikal, seen and unseen 127 Sihyaj Chan K'awiil's successors considered him an especially important ancestor, for they placed his burial on the North Acropolis central axis, and Structure 33-1 st was the tallest, grandest North Acropolis structure.16 The Stela 31 fragment may have been considered a tangible locus of contact with this sacred ancestor, for when created, it had embodied him, and in its modified state it may have embodied his memory or inspired activation of ritual participants' memories about him. Furthermore, the Maya may have revered it for its naming of a series of early ancestral rulers, such as Yax Ehb Xook and Foliated Jaguar. Nevertheless, the text on the stela's back may not have been legible within the shrine, for it was close to the rear wall (ibid.:758). Although the narrations may have been of extreme importance in the choice to preserve and revere this monument, reception of those narrations was less important in this new phase of the monument's life history, and when buried, its images and inscriptions were denied to all human viewers, though the sacred object still may have been remembered. The ancient Maya buried another broken sculpture in relation to the buried Stela 31, perhaps in order to preserve physical relationships among sculptures that had been important when displayed. Specifically, in the fill of 5D-33-1st, centered in front of 5D-33-2nd, they buried three large fragments of Altar 19, which may once have been paired with Stela 31 (Jones and Satterthwaite 1982:64; Coe 1990:759-760). Damage to the altar had been violent, with the obliteration of much of the body of the depicted seated person and the altar itself, though the three altar fragments were gathered and interred in front of Structure 33 (Jones and Satterthwaite 1982:figs. 61, 109; Coe 1990:759; see fig. 6 here). If Stela 31 and Altar 19 were once a pair on view, they were a pair within the building's fill as well, the stela buried at the top of 33-2nd and the altar at its base, the two functioning together as offerings to the structure, even though neither was visible to living humans.17 In these new contexts, the sculptures remained in a physical and material association that is parallel to the one they had when displayed. In other words, the visible interrelations of these and other sculptures were not the only salient aspect of ancient Maya sculptures, for their material Figure 6. Tikal Altar 19, Maya, ca. a.d. 445. Limestone. Museo Sylvanus G. Morley, Parque Nacional Tikal. Photograph by the author. presences and physical relationships also appear to have been of profound import.18 As with Stela 26, one motivation for Stela 31's burial may have been because it was broken, and its burial put the monument to rest. The Maya performed numerous rituals to the stela in its enshrinement and burial, but buried in the center of Structure 33-1 st Stela 31 also became an offering to?and seed of?the new structure, transferring its ch'ulel to the new building. The intensity of offerings demonstrates it was an extremely sacred, powerful object. Its power may have lain in who this ancestor was, or the Maya may have considered this stela to be sacred, both because of the persistence of sacral ity in once-consecrated objects and because of the sacredness accrued through ceremonies performed on it, its materiality imbued with sacred heat from ceremonial fires. 16. Sihyaj Chan K'awiil may have been especially revered because he restored the pre-Teotihuacan Yax Ehb Xook dynastic line and incorporated it with theTeotihuacan line in the fifth century a merging that Stela 31 celebrates. 1 7. Another fragment of Altar 19 was separated from them, though it remained nearby buried as a supporting stone for Stela P6, a plain stela in front of 33-1 st (Coe 1990:523). 18. The cached Tikal Stela 40 in Structure 5D-29 of the North Acropolis may have formed another physical?but invisible? relationship with Stela 31. Stela 40 was a monument of K'an Chitam, Sihyaj Chan K'awiil's son and successor; Stela 40 emulated Stela 31 in form and composition; both were broken in the ancient past, and?intriguingly?both were buried in North Acropolis temples. See Valdes, Fahsen, and Munoz (1997) for a description of Stela 40 and its discovery in Structure 5D-29.</page><page sequence="10">128 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 In the cases of Stelae 26 and 31, there is evidence of continued memory and commemoration of sculptures buried in buildings. The ancient Maya performed fire ceremonies not only on the sculptures, but also in the rooms where they had been cached or in shrines above them, suggesting that their significance and relevance continued to persist within memory and ceremony, not only beyond the act of destruction, but also beyond the moment of interment, when they became invisible to the human eye but still remained present?both in the material sense and in the conceptual sense, within the heart of buildings and within social memory. Furthermore, these sculptures?deposited as offerings to buildings, bodies, and ancestors?continued to perform after burial, sanctifying buildings and transferring their power or sacredness to those buildings, making them into even more sacred structures for the worship and commemoration of divine ancestors. Stela 32 In addition to the interment of large stelae, the Tikal Maya buried smaller portions of monuments in significant locations. For instance, inside the North Acropolis Structure 26, archaeologists found two fitting fragments of Stela 32 in Problematical Deposit 22 (PD 22), whose contents appear to have come from a disturbed tomb. The fragments bear a carved image of a frontal face wearing a headdress that emulates Teotihuacan imagery, very similar to the shield that Yax Nuun Ahiin holds on Stela 31's right side (fig. 7). In fact, Stelae 32 and 31 may have been contemporaneous (mid-fifth century a.d.), and Stela 32's deposition in PD 22 may have occurred in the late seventh or early eighth century, soon after Stela 31 's interment (Coe 1990: 326-327). Located on the building's center line, PD 22 clearly was deposited as an offering for the structure's sanctification, and the ancient Maya set the Stela 32 fragments face down in the cache (ibid.:324-325). Also in this deposit were one of four discovered fragments of Stela 33; two other sculptural fragments (MS 49 and 109: Fragment 2); and numerous other items, including shattered, burned human bones, which Coe suggests formed a "secondary burial of a partially cremated, rather elderly male" (ibid.).19 Except for Figure 7. Tikal Stela 32, Maya, ca. fifth century a.d. Limestone. Museo Sylvanus G. Morley, Parque Nacional Tikal. Photograph by the author. the face-down placement of the Stela 32 fragments, the items were jumbled together, though we cannot discount their presence as important components of the cache. For instance, although the smaller fragments are so damaged that they are hardly recognizable as monuments, they were deemed valuable for offering. Their presence may point to the value placed on stone material and potentially to the persistent sacredness of once-consecrated sculptures, even when destroyed, their caching allowing their sacredness to be transferred to the new building. Buried on the pyramid's central axis, the PD 22 cache served as a seed for the new building, with the items offered to the structure. Although the Stela 32 depositional context is different from the other stelae interments previously discussed, particularly in terms 19. These three sculptural fragments are small: MS 109: Fragment 2 has a maximum dimension of 0.31 m; MS 49's maximum dimension is 0.18 m (Jones and Satterthwaite 1982:74, 88-89, 93). Some carving remains on each, including a portion of a human face on MS 109 (ibid.ifig. Ille). Other materials in PD 22 included eccentric flints and obsidians, obsidian blade cores and flakes, one piece of green obsidian (from Central Mexico), pieces of turtle carapace and crocodile scutes, a travertine metate, jade and spondylus beads, marine shells, coralline algae, an imitation stingray spine, vessel shards, and the burned human bones (Coe 1990:324-325).</page><page sequence="11">O'Neil: Ancient Maya sculptures of Tikal, seen and unseen 129 of scale and focus on the monuments, the Maya treated the stela fragments with care and reverence. Moreover, the Maya performed fire ceremonies on Structure 26 throughout the five phases of the structure's history, both before and after the cache's interment (ibid.:297), demonstrating that this building was another locus for ceremonial commemoration over an extended period. The caching of other sculptural types Hombre de Tikal At Tikal, other types of sculptures were buried with special treatment as well. In the cases discussed, we see multiple phases of interaction with monuments, including breaking, movement, burning, and burial, demonstrating that the life histories of these monuments can be just as complex and meaningful as any initial meaning in an object's creation. Another sculpture that beautifully exemplifies this idea is the Hombre de Tikal, an Early Classic anthropomorphic sculpture whose life history consists of distinct phases and types of human interactions?including creation, decapitation, recarving, and burial?that happened over a century or more (fig. 8). The Hombre de Tikal is a sculpture of a seated man with a rotund belly; his arms bear glyphic cartouches, and on his back are deeply incised texts.20 The texts are in different calligraphic styles, with historical names from different moments in time, and several scholars have argued that the texts were not contemporaneous, positing that ChakTok Ich'aak I commissioned the sculpture in the fourth century, and that the carving on the back was from the early fifth century when Yax Nuun Ahiin reused and recarved?and maybe decapitated?it, making it his own, perhaps symbolic of his usurpation of ChakTok Ich'aak's throne (Fahsen 1988; Martin and Grube 2008:28-33; Laporte 2001:263). The Hombre de Tikal was reused again when it was interred in Burial 212, located in the central rear room of the shrine of Structure 3D-43's penultimate phase, which was buried in the building's final phase.21 Burial 212 contained two human skeletons, one adult male and one adolescent female, with ornaments, cinnabar, and copal offerings; the Hombre de Tikal was in the eastern part of 20. The naturalism of his three-dimensional form is rare in limestone sculpture at Tikal, though there are parallels in wooden sculptures, including the K'awiil sculptures from Burial 195, and stucco masks on architecture. A comparable stone sculpture is the sculpture of Bird Jaguar?which also was decapitated?from Yaxchilan Structure 33. 21. Structure 3D-43 is located in Group H.

Photograph by the author. the room.22 Laporte and Carlos Herman date the burial to the late fifth century, in the reign of K'an Chitam (458 ca. 486) or ChakTok Ich'aak II (ca. 488-508) (Laporte 2001:263-264; Laporte and Herman 2003:378). If in the reign of ChakTok Ich'aak II, the sculpture's caching may have been a meaningful connection between Chak Tok Ich'aak II and his earlier namesake, this physical appropriation was a way to make contact with a particularly revered predecessor. The Hombre de Tikal's caching in the shrine's back, central room is similar to the cached locations of Stelae 26 and 31,23 And like those sculptures, the Hombre 22. The other tomb offerings were rich in ceramics and marine material. The room's north wall was covered with stucco and a painted mural; the Hombre de Tikal was turned toward this wall (Laporte 2001:263-264; Laporte and Herman 2003:371, 375-378). 23. When the tomb was placed in the back room, the doorways into the room were blocked by stones, suggesting that the rest of the temple's superstructure was left open and used before the last building phase enveloped the structure. If so, the tomb and its offerings were hidden but remained proximate for contact and worship within the shrine, a situation analogous to Stela 26 in Structure 34's shrine. Laporte and Herman (2003:372) note that three dedicatory offerings were deposited?one a set of Early Classic lip-to-lip cache vessels? with the construction of the building's last phase.</page><page sequence="12">130 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 de Tikal had been desecrated but later was shown reverence.24 In fact, the recovery and placement of three of ChakTok Ich'aak I's monuments?the Hombre de Tikal, Stela 26, and Stela 3925?in shrines in the centers or backs of temples give a strong indication that even after the desecration of ChakTok Ich'aak I's sculptures and memory, there were attempts to restore his name, memory, and worship by recovering his sculptures. At the same time, this is another sculpture whose text makes reference to multiple ancestors, and as with Stelae 26 and 31, the presence of those names may have been further reason to preserve this sculpture as a treasured heirloom of the past. Within Burial 212, the Hombre de Tikal functioned as an offering to one or more of the persons buried in the tomb. Interred in relation to a human burial, the Hombre de Tikal's deposition is similar to those of Stelae 26 and 31, for although they were interred centuries after the humans in the tombs and buried apart from them, in all cases there remains a crucial connection between buried sculptural bodies and human bodies. Moreover, the fifth century burial of the Hombre de Tikal and the seventh or eighth-century burial of Stelae 26 and 31 occurred two or more centuries apart, suggesting continuity over time for such practices, both in the careful interment of broken sculptures and in their burial in relation to tombs of rulers or other elite persons. Marcador Another Early Classic sculpture?the Tikal Marcador (Ballcourt Marker)?was buried in a significant location, though this sculpture was perfectly preserved, demonstrating there were other reasons the ancient Maya buried sculptures than the fact that they were broken (fig. 9). The Marcador also was different from the others because it did not depict a human or anthropomorphic being but a feathered standard. Its form is a vertical cylinder with a feathered disk on top that is balanced on a sphere rising out of a cylindrical post; a feathered skirt hangs from the sphere, acting as roofing for the inscribed text on the post. One side of the disk bears Spearthrower Owl's name; the other contains a common Teotihuacan symbol referring to the Storm God Tlaloc (Laporte and Fialko 1990:51). On the post is a Mayan hieroglyphic text recounting the arrival of Sihyaj K'ahk' to Tikal in a.d. 378; information about Spearthrower Owl, including an accession statement; and the sculpture's dedication in a.d. 416 (ibid.; Stuart 2000:481-490). The Marcador sculpture is a Teotihuacan form, and its text explains the presence of such a monument at Tikal, precisely because of the activities of Spearthrower Owl and Sihyaj K'ahk'. Proyecto Nacional Tikal archaeologists found the Marcador cached in an altar in Tikal's Group 6C-XVI, an Early Classic complex with multiple structures and patios located south of the Mundo Perdido.26They cached it circa a.d. 425 within Altar 48-sub, a small platform in the center of the complex's North Plaza, where it once may have been displayed (Fialko 1988:121; Laporte and Fialko 1990:48, fig. 3.15). Altar 48 had talud-tablero architectural forms, recallingTeotihuacan's architecture and aligning with the sculpture's form and textual content. The Marcador was laid down within the cache, oriented north-south, with a spondylus shell beneath it and a stucco head to its east, and the entire altar was buried, as were other North Plaza structures (Laporte 1987:228; Fialko 1988:121-122; Laporte and Fialko 1995:65-66, 71). What is intriguing, however, is that archaeologists report no signs of breakage, desecration, or ritual treatment such as burning on the sculpture or in the cache, characteristics of all other buried sculptures at Tikal. Nevertheless, inclusion of the Spondylus shell and stucco head as offerings denote a reverential burial that is analogous to other buried sculptures. People at Tikal may have buried the Marcador because they considered it obsolete, its message no longer valued within changing politics of the Tikal polity and its relation to Teotihuacan. Nevertheless, even if they perceived the Marcador's message as obsolete, they cached it with reverence and care, suggesting they understood it to hold some sort of power or sacrality. Its power may have lain in the Marcador's narrations of powerful figures and history-changing events of the past, or it may simply have inhered in the stone, having been imbued within the stone during its ceremonial dedication, regardless of the specifics of its textual narrations. After burial, there was no visible record?at least that survives?that the Marcador and Altar 48 were interred there, for the altar and the North Plaza were covered, 24. There appears to be erosion on its broken surface, which means it was redisplayed after being decapitated but before burial. 25. PNT archaeologists found the broken Stela 39 in the shrine atop Structure 5D-86-7 in the Mundo Perdido, directly above a royal tomb. There were ceramic offerings associated with the stela in the shrine (Ayala 1987; Laporte and Fialko 1995). 26. This group, located 350 meters south of the Mundo Perdido, was occupied from Phase Manik 2 to Manik 3b (a.d. 300-550) (Fialko 1988:218).</page><page sequence="13">O'Neil: Ancient Maya sculptures of Tikal, seen and unseen 131 and by the sixth century a.d., the entire complex was covered (Laporte 1987:228; 2003:295). Furthermore, archaeological reports give no indication of burning or other ceremonial activity above the location of their burial. It is possible there was memory of the cached objects and the altar, though there is no evidence of ceremonial practice in subsequent architectural forms. Nevertheless, if there were memory, it may have pointed to absence, a remembrance with an intention of forgetting, of suppressing a visual record of events that may not have been celebrated at the time. Even so, they neither erased nor destroyed this record; instead, they effectively preserved it, potentially because of its sacred nature as a once-consecrated monument. Conclusion: Visibility, invisibility, presence At Tikal, the ancient Maya practiced a range of sculpture burial, varying in terms of sculptural type; condition of sculptures (from whole and undamaged to fragmented); and their burial contexts. In this essay, I have argued that monuments and fragments continued to signify or perform after burial. I contend that at times they signified because of what they narrated or depicted, but more often they performed because of what they were, and because they provided tangible, material connections to ancestors. At least in some examples, what was carved on monuments did matter in the choice of how and where to bury them. For example, the Late Classic Maya buried ChakTok Ich'aak I's fourth-century Stela 26 in Structure 34 of the North Acropolis, resetting, burying, and revering the sculpture, arguably as a way to restore the dignity of the defiled king and come into contact with this sacred ancestor. The epigraphic record implies that ChakTok Ich'aak I was assassinated in a.d. 378, and at this time or later at least three of his sculptures?Stela 26, Stela 39, and the Hombre de Tikal?were broken, potentially by theTeotihuacan-affiliated regime who usurped his throne. Nevertheless, the Maya later collected these sculptures and placed them in special locations: Stela 26 in an altar in the Temple 34 shrine, where they performed ceremonies and deposited offerings; Stela 39 in the shrine of Structure 5D-86-7 in the Mundo Perdido, making offerings to it through the Terminal Classic (Laporte and Fialko 1995:84); and the Hombre de Tikal, which they interred in a late fifth-century elite tomb?surrounded by offerings? in Group H. These examples demonstrate that despite the fourth-century desecration of ChakTok Ich'aak I and his sculptural embodiments, his descendants and successors Figure 9. Tikal Marcador, Maya, a.d. 416. Limestone. Museo Nacional de Arqueologfa e Etnologfa, Guatemala. Photograph by the author.</page><page sequence="14">132 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 sought to restore his memory by recovering and placing those sculptures in sacred locations in the context of multiple offerings and fire ceremonies. The ancient Maya also reset Stela 31?a monument embodying Sihyaj Chan K'awiil I?in a temple shrine, which they then buried within a larger building phase. There are multiple lines of evidence that suggest that Sihyaj Chan K'awiil's descendants especially revered and remembered him, for they buried him on the North Acropolis's primary north-south axis, and later they made his funerary temple into the largest and grandest of the North Acropolis?and the anchor to which they positioned Temples I and II. Sihyaj Chan K'awiiI's funerary pyramid seems to be the natural place for the resetting and burial of Stela 31, and the interred sculptural and human bodies of Sihyaj Chan K'awiil sacralized this temple, affirming the location as a place for contact with and worship of this sacred and revered ancestor. On the other hand, ChakTok Ich'aak's Stela 26 was interred in the funerary pyramid of Yax Nuun Ahiin, the man who took?or usurped?the throne after ChakTok Ich'aak I's untimely death. The resetting, burial, and worship of ChakTok Ich'aak's Stela 26 above Yax Nuun Ahiin's burial place may have symbolized a conversion of the building from a monument to Yax Nuun Ahiin into a place for the memory and worship of ChakTok Ich'aak I.27 In the cases of Stela 26 in Temple 34 and Stela 31 in Temple 33, the remains of offerings and fire ceremonies provide strong evidence for continued commemoration around and above the interred sculptures, with remembrance of what was buried. These shrines were sites for the memory and worship of ancestors, and the ceremonial performances would have allowed ritual participants to come into contact with sacred ancestors, using these spaces?and the remembered presences of human and sculptural bodies?to conjure ancestors and activate their memory. Moreover, the indices of 27. The fact that Teobert Maler (1911:70-71) found Yax Nuun Abiin's Stela 4 planted upside-down in front of Structure 34 may provide further evidence of such a conversion. Just has discussed the inversion of Stela 4 as a "conquest-related form of sculptural modification/' suggesting that its inversion related to its Teotihuacan forms, and that those who inverted it were distancing themselves from Tikal's "earlier interactions with Teotihuacan" (Just 2005:72-73). Whereas I agree, I suggest that this inversion was more specifically directed to Yax Nuun Ahiin and the events of the late fourth-century historical moment and not to a broader rejection of Teotihuacan, for there are emulative references to Teotihuacan?in sculpture, architecture, and inscriptions?from Late Classic Tikal. Even so, Just's conclusion that the Stela 4 inversion "either deactivated or severely altered the potency of the image" (ibid.:75) is an important one. ceremonies would have been visible reminders to others of such reverential practice, marking the place as a sacred location worthy of continued commemoration. At the same time, I argue that these sculptures also performed outside of human perception. Buried on buildings' centers or central axes, they dedicated and sanctified buildings, served as seeds for new buildings, and transferred their ch'ulel and otherwise sacred materialities into the structures, which further enlivened or sacralized them. This may be the case for the cached Stela 32 fragments as well, for those who cached them perceived them to be worthy of offering on the building's central axis, the objects thereby performing as an offering to and sacralization of the building. Moreover, these central locations also may have been the most appropriate places for sculpture burial because of the sacredness that persisted within them from their initial dedications and consecrations?regardless of their carving or any desire to remember or forget the images or texts carved on their surfaces. In fact, across the range of buried sculptures, both ones that appear to have been buried for remembrance and ones buried for forgetting, the Maya interred them in special locations on buildings' centers and central axes and in the midst of other offerings. Even if the intention of burial was one of suppression, there remained a need to give them a proper burial or disposal, for they were sacred objects that demanded such treatment. For each of these cases, I have privileged the monuments' carvings, and I do so because I believe the ancient Maya did, for larger fragments and ones with preserved carvings received the most elaborate burials. Nevertheless, there were smaller fragments and some with severely damaged carvings that were buried in caches, and it may have been their persistent sacredness as once-consecrated objects that inspired their deposition as offerings. Their caching may have been pragmatic, a mode of disposal for material objects that had been consecrated, used in ceremonies, or otherwise perceived as sacred. Simultaneously, their deposition doubled as offerings to other entities. In conclusion, the patterns of sculpture burial at Tikal demonstrate that for the ancient Maya, invisible objects were not inactive objects. Although visibility and display were important paradigms for the ancient Maya, this was not to the exclusion of the invisible, for the invisible was an active mode, potentially even a performative one, which worked in tandem with and in opposition to the visible. In the Popol Vuh, the Hero Twins could be sensed through other modes of perception or signs that announced their continued presence and action, even</page><page sequence="15">O'Neil: Ancient Maya sculptures of Tikal, seen and unseen 133 when unseen. Likewise, I argue that the ancient Maya considered the sculptures they buried in buildings to be active, for despite their invisibility, people remembered and recalled them, making offerings to them and making contact with ancestors through them. Furthermore, even when unseen, these sculptures themselves could be active, performing roles of building dedication, sanctifying structures, and making offerings to ancestors and other divinities.
