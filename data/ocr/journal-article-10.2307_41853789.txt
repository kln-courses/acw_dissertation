Our country to-day is seized with grave perils. We have lost faith in our old moral values and spiritual norms. In some quarters we are busy imitating the west. The colossal supremacy of the western indu- strialized countries has always been a subtle subconscious force creating a predilection in favour of political and social philosophies originating in the west. The dynamic social transformatics in the eastern European countries and in China have predisposed some people towards some form of communism or people's democracy or a new form of democracy. Hence intellectually we are in a confused state. Because of intellectual opaqueness we are not clear about the course of our future action. The root problem is how shall our country become a powèrful and vital sphere of political existence. The tremendous moral and spiritual forces which were released by the personality of Gandhi are declining. We are more careful for expediency. Marxism, because of its success in some countries appears to be assuming the place of a prophetic dispensation. For us all, and specially for the intellectuals it is nece- ssary once more to discuss the fundamentals of political philosophies. There are several creeds and cults engaging our attention. The western democratic equalitarianism is one, and politically we are committed to that. There is the general prevalent belief that this political form is suited to the realization of the Gandhian political philosophy. There is the socialistic formula with its combination of democracy and the economic plans of plenty and its righteous distribution. Communism is fashionable in some circles and although it indulges in occasional quotation from Marx and Engels it basically is inspired by the plans and formulas of Soviet Russia and lately New China. In the present paper, on grounds of philosophy of history and sociology we will try to indicate the merits and demerits of the two dominant political philoso- phies of Gandhi and Marx. ( 115 )</page><page sequence="2">ii6 VISU WA NA TH PRASAD V ARM A No philosophy of history can be separated from the impact of the personality of the original creators of that system. Gandhi was no systematic thinker but that does not detract from his importance. He was an inspired teacher and prophet who did not have the acumen or the intention to work out a logical and theoretical construction. He was neither a Shankara nor a Kant. Instead he is akin to Socrates and Buddha, pouring forth the result of his deepest feelings and the most sincere realizations of truth. But in all the writings of Gandhi from 1908 onwards, one finds a unity of theme with the minimum amount of contradiction. Marx was trained in the traditions of German leftwing Hegelian metaphysics. He believed in the efficacy of logical reason änd for over thirty years he laboured and toiled persistently to finish his system although the basic insights that he worked out into his theory were felt and perceived by 1848. Gandhi has influenced people through his pen but more by his sermons and the singularly attractive personality of the gentle prophet has always evoked a feeling of the deepest reverence even from the quarters which thought they were his enemies or he theirs. Marx engaged in bitter and furious polemics with Proudhon, the Bauer brothers- Edgar and Bruno, with the German "true socialists", with Lassalle and Bakunin. He was an aggresive personality conscious of his towering intellectual strength which he thought, because of false and perverse consciousness, the contemporary philistines failed to recognise.1 His passion for Germanic scholarly thoroughness is apparent in his works and most so in the three volumes of the portentous and ponderous Das Kapital. 2. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ( i ) Metaphysical Idealism Versus Dialectical Materialism. Gandhi started with the conception of an omnipresent fundamental spiritual reality which could be called Sachchidatianda or Brahman or Rama or simply Truth.® He inherited the strong faith in the existence of a deeper spiritual existent from his family back-ground, specially from his devout mother. The writings of Tolstoy, his studies of Budd- ha s personal life and the Gita and his contacts with the Raychand Bhai, deepened and strengthened his convictions. Hence Gandhi was a metaphysical idealist but not of the Sankarite school. His views are similar to those of the theistic interpreters . of Vedanta. The spiritual i.

Mahatma Gandhi's article in Contemporary Indian Philosophy; His Autobiography; and Anasaktiyoga.</page><page sequence="3">GANDHI AND MARX 117 truth, according to him, was not to be realized by dialectical skill or conceptual cognition but by spiritual experience, pure and disciplined holy life and by the persistent endeavour to concretize the norm of Ahimsa in one's action. Hence we find a synthesis of Vedantic meta- physics and Jaina-Buddistic ethics in Gandhi. Experience is the star- ting point of any philosophy and Gandhi claimed that the more disci- plined he became the more did he approximate to the realization of this truth. The greatest nyptics and religious teachers of humanity have testified to the inward experience of some eternal values and real exist- ence. Gandhi did not negate rational arguments and practical obser- vation. He claimed to be a true scientist in the sense that he const- antly experimented with truth and tried to make his propositions sounder by repeated observations. But this scientific and rational process of enquiry was only applicable to the world of social and politi- cal existence. His faith in a fundamental truth was not born out of arguments and observations but out of spiritual apprehension and intuition. Marx, on the other hand was a rationalist.1 Mysticism and faith were anathema to him. Idealistic philosophy according to him tried to hypostatize the functional product of the human brain. He flourished in the era of Biblical criticism and wanted to unravel the secrets of the cosmos by sole reference to reason and science. He fused the materialistic tradition of Democritus, Hobbes, Holbach, and Feuerbach with the dialectics of German philosophy.8 Nature, society and the human brain moved and functioned as if in a process of incessant flux and dynamic motion. There was no static motionless ultimate.8 The difficulty about the choice between materialism and idealism refers to the inscrutable nature of the ultimate truth. Despite Engels' belief that the progressive march of science would trans- form the Kantian things-in-themselves into things-for-us, we still find that science cannot answer the question either of the final destiny or of the primitive emergence of the world. Whether we accept Haeckel's matter or Bergson's Elanvital or Alexander's primal space- i . For an exposition and favourable interpretation of dialectical materialism, see F. Engels: Dialectics of Nature and Ludwig Beuerbach V. I. Lenin, Materialism and Empirio-Criti- cism; Plekhanov: Fundamental Problems of Marxism , In Defence of Materialism etc. 2.

Even after the researches in the field of electromagnetism, it is a matter of faith to accept that the motions in the nucleaf sphere have ultimately generated the mighty flowers of the human brain. It is nothing but mysticism to accept that out of matter in motion or out of space-time all the great achievments in the fields of science and art have come out. If it is the example of primitive unsophisticated faith to believe in the creation of this universe-this either 'vale of tears' or the best of all possible worlds, by the fiat of an omniscient being, or to conceive of the World as the self-manifestation of an absolute in search of self- consciousness and delight, it is no less a mysticism and no less primitive to accept that the dialectically subtle and qualitatively different motion of the ultimate material reality sometimes transforms itself into the minds of a Plato or an Aristotle or a Darwin or a Leonardo or a Christ or a Napoleon; or that sometimes the ultimate material reality decides at a primordial sacred hour to create life on the basis of material configurations and arrangements and at another pristine hour it made possible the emergence of man from the anthropoid ape. Hence the acceptance of any conception about the ultimate reality involves faith and primitive belief. The origination and processes of the cosmos cannot be éxplained-neither by the Vedanta, nor by the Nebular hypothesis of Kant nor by the dialectical materialism of Marx. Any view that we uphold is vitally influenced by our childhood and adoles- cent experiences in life. But idealism has one advantage of offering at least some consolation. We get the assurance of immortality, moral freedom and the conservation of the spiritual consciousness. It holds the prospect of a better future and at least has pragmatic advantages. But while arguing along these lines we do not mean to deny the value of science. Science has remarkable achievements to its credit in the field of cosmology, chemistry, physics and industrial technology. But science cannot shed any definite light on the ultimate origin of the universe or on the final destiny óf the finite self. But although this question of the final destiny of things can be settled neither by science nor by any system of philosophy, it does not mean that we have to become nihilists. At least both the camps are agreed that we have to live on the earth and live happily. For the creation of a better future society, idealism provides better insight and more solid faith.1 When we accept that the spirit is the ultimate i. Cf. B.

Man as a spiritual and moral subject, containing in himself the reflection of an eternal spiritual consciousness, becomes exalted. As a spirit he can rise superior to nature and can by the collective use of his rational powers, control the blind forces of an alien and mechani- cal necessity. He can enjoy reflective consciousness and contemplation. Idealism in metaphysics generates philosophies of social and political concord and harmony. Hence on the grounds of ethical and social consequences also, metaphysical idealism has a great lesson to teach. (ii) Ethical Absolutism Versus Ethical Relativism. A study of metaphysics is not only important for the reason that it affords insight into the problems of the origin of the cosmos and the destiny of man but also because it vitally determines our social and political thought. Gandhi accepted idealism and hence he believed in the supremacy of ethical absolutism and the sociology of Sarvodaya ( the good of all). The Gandhian theory of ethical absolutism can be traced to the Vedic concept of the Rita - the doctrine that there are all-encompassing cosmic and moral ordinances which govern both men and gods. Buddha had faith in the existence of a moral Order. The great Hindu philosopher Patanjali accepted that the cardinal concepts of ethics ( the five Y ama and the five Niyama) were beyond the rela- tivism of space and time. Gandhi accepts these insights. His own experiences in life convinced him of the superior efficacy of the moral norm. He considered truth and non-violence to be absolutely binding. Marxism on the other hand accepts the relativism of the moral criterion. It considers that our ethical codes are the products of our social growth.1 There are no eternal moral principles and the ethical system is relative to the relations of production. The growth of historical sociology and cultural anthropology substantiates the faith in the relativism of the ethical standards and our judgment of moral value. This question of ethical absolutism versus ethical relativism is fundamental. On one I. F. Engels : Anti-Duhring (International Publishers, New York, 1939) pp. 104-105 : "We therefore reject every attempt to impose on us any moral dogma whatsoever as an eternal, ultimate and forever immutable moral law on the pretext that the moral world too has its permanent principles which transcend history and the differences between nations. We maintain on the contrary that all former moral theories are the product, in the last analysis, of the economic stage which society had rea- ched at that particular epoch. And as society has hither to moved in class antagonism, morality was always a class morality." However, Engels visualises the evolution of a really human morality. "A really human morality which transcends class antagonisms and their legacies in thought becomes possible only at a stage of society which has not only overcome class contra- dictions but has even forgotten them in practical life." Ibid p. 105.</page><page sequence="6">120 VISHW AN ATH PRASAD V ARMA side we find Buddha, Kant and Gandhi preaching the sanctity of the moral norms and on the other we find sociologists and anthropologists standing for the relativism of even the most sacred ideas about human relations. It is true that we find differences in the moral conceptions of an African Bushman, a Western European Professor and a Hindu sage. But to argue therefrom that all ethical standards are relative, with the implication that one does not have to worry seriously about them, especially if he happens to be an intellectual, is unfounded. In the lowest specimens of human civilization we find some crude and dim conception of a good. We may find, from the historical and social standpoint, a differential gradation in the conceptions and objective concretizai ion of the good but it only points out that they are partial approximations to some objective categories of good and truth. As human beings, whereever we may be, wave to progress towards the realization of that objective truth and good and not to destroy the foundations of truth, honesty and justice. The theory of moral univer- salism and absolutism as pointed out by Gandhi, is one of the serious contributions to world thought. We do not say much when we merely attempt the sociological analysis or justice and truth as being only ideological safeguards of a particular entrenched social interest in power. Hence, for the foundations of a human commonwealth, the Gandhian theory of ethical absolutism is more suited than the ethical relativism of Marxism. It is true that the charge of being unrealistic may be levelled against us. But we do not have to postulate the rules of socio- logical and political expediency as our guides. We have to postulate an ethical code suited to man as man and commensurate with his sub- jective moral stature. Without being ethereal, if we say that even with our so called enemies we have to behave according to the canons of justice, truth and non-violence, we are not being unmindful of the social reality. The great moral prophets of Stoicism, Buddhism and Christianity have certainly helped in the regeneration, rationalization and moraíization of our untamed, self-satisfied and egoistic propensities. Gandhi belongs to this line of moral thinkers and his teachings undoub- tedly have left a deep impress on our character. ( iii ) Religion as a Factor in History. Since Gandhi believed in truth and non-violence, he accepted the force of religion in human history. He called himself a Hindu but he was no narrow sectarian. Like Buddha and Ramakrishna he was above the bounds of creeds, cults,' rituals and ceremonies. He accepted the essence of Hinduism which according to him was the essence of all the</page><page sequence="7">GANDHI AND MARX I2l great religions of mankind as Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Zoroas- trianism.1 Religion according to Gandhi signified an emphasis on the moral values of man as spirit. It provided the dynamic motion to his actions and life. He said that he was in quest of Moksha - redem- ption and emancipation of' the soul from the clutches of Maya. But emancipation to Gandhi did not signify isolation. It did not mean the negation and repudiation of the claims of the society and the human kind. Freedom to Gandhi meant the voluntary acceptance and enthu- siastic fulfilment of the duties that naturally came one's way - Swadh- arma. In the spirit of the Gita he felt that if lived with a sense of detachment and disinterestedness the life of Karmayoga could lead to the attainment of freedom and Moksha. A life of dedicated service to one's kind does not generate an attitude of aggressive or self-righteous altruism, but will lead to a progressive expansion of the human self till it came • to comprehend almost the whole ' of human kind. Karmayoga, meant extension of consciousness and that signified a cosmic and spiritual awareness. In the human heart an eternal battle was raging between the forces of good and evil and Karmayoga signified the elimination of the latter and the victory of truth, good and virtue. Thus we see that when Gandhi talked of the religious basis of politics he was not preaching primitivism but a life of strenuous dynamic acti- vity in quest of the good of one's soul and mankind. He accepted the Biblical precept that it is far better to lose the world than to lose one's soul. In the present materialistic, sensate phase of human civilization Gandhi's conception of Karmayoga , as established on the basis of the teachings of the Gita is a fundamental contribution. Dialectical materialism considers religion to be a reactionary force. It is regarded as irrational because it teaches the fantastic cult of the fetishism of one's own mental creations. The ghosts and gods of a dead outworn polytheistic pantheon are enshrined by religion, in place of attempting for the growth of scientific knowledge and light. Reli- gion substitutes the empty futuristic chiliastic consolation of an immor- tal destiny for the contemporary subjection to misery, exploitation and oppression. At times it is hypocritical and bishops and priests preach vague and fantastic gospels of eternity and the kingdom of God because they are in the service of the temporal powers. Religion according to Engels contains remnants of antiquated anthropomorphic conceptions of old. Generally, Marx and Engels preach that religion is an ideology i. See Gandhi's articles entitled "Hinduism", "The place of Jesus", and "Christianity and Hinduism".</page><page sequence="8">122 VISHWANATH PRASAD VARMA fitted to the production, organizations and relations of the time.1 Hence with the dawn of the society of freedom, abundance and equality, man would not need the consolations of religion. Subservience to the blind forces of capital would be replaced by the triumphant victory of posi- tive science. At that fateful moment religion and philosophy would wither away.* Religion in its institutional and historical phases does contain for- mulas of compromise with the powers that be. The Orthodox Russian church supported Czardom. In the middle ages Christianity under the pretensions of the medieval popes fought secular battles. Islam often offered two alternatives- either of conversion or of the sword. Hinduism has sanctioned the grossest superstitions and social tyrannies. But despite all these shortcomings, religion has stood for the supremacy of the human spirit. It has sought to provide a rationale and foundation for our moral endeavours and has tried to interpret the meaning of human existence in coherent fashion. We do not want false creeds. We have to shun institutional inquisitions but we need the religious spirit of tolerance, mutual reciprocal intersubjective goodwill, peace and justice. Religion is integral to the human being.» He cannot get rid of it. Ii is contradictory to believe in the human spirit and its powers of creatmsm and to repudiate religion. It provides the spiritual founda- tions of our social existence. Democracy and socialism both are inten- sely religious movements notwithstanding their professed creeds of secularism and science. If democracy has to succeed it cannot be i. "The religious world is but the reflex of the real world. And for a society based upon the production óf commodities, in which the producers in general enter into social relations with one another by treating their products as commodities and values, whereby they reduce their individual private labour to the standard of homogeneous human labour-for such a society, Christianity with its cults of abstract man, more specially in its bourgeois developments, Protestantism, Deism etc , is the most fitting form of religion"-Ca/&gt;»&lt;«¿ Vol. I p. 91.

Engels Anti-Buhring p. 43; "If we deduce world schematisms not from our minds, but only through our minds from the real world, deducing the basic principles of being from what is, we need no philosophy for this purpose, but positive know- ledge of the world and of what happens in it; and what this yields is also no philoso- phy, but positive science."

Democracy is based on the sanctity of the human personality and faith in the rational powers of man. Demo- cratic values postulate decency and justice and only religion can provide them. It is not insignificant that Mannheim, Laski and Croce reiterate the need for values for the working of the democratic system. It should not be forgotten that in the teachings of the seventeenth century Puri- tans are to be traced the origins of democracy. Socialism is a religion trying to make possible on earth the old religious promise of the rule of God.1 Socialism represents the secularisation of the teachings of the Bible. Only religion, in the true sense of the acceptance of the spiritual potentialities of man, can provide the dynamic to social action. Reli- gion postulates the wholeness of attitude-integration. Life, human life, is a unity and it cannot be fragmentalized. Without the religious spirit, no socialism can succeed. It will degenerate into collective egoism, revolutions, violence and the myth of the socio-economic ultimates. The religious spirit teaches self-sacrifice, mutui love, dedication and surrender and it is impossible to accept that a mere change in the political and institutional structure will bring the millenium. In the true Gandhian spirit modern statesmen have accepted that war origi- nates in the minds of men. History is not the record of the divergent forces of production and economic organizations fighting and realizing a temporary compromise, but it is the record of the activities of the mind of man. Religion can transform the mind of man, not by some super- normal hypnosis, but by suggestion and growth and moral elevation. Hence religion is not the opium of the people but is really the nectar of mankind. ( iv ) Sociology and Economics. Starting from different metaphysical orientations, Gandhi and Marx provide divergent solutions for mankind. The central evils against which Gandhi fought were racialism, imperialism, communalism and untouchability. The problems of labour versus capital were not acutely significant for him. In South Africa he fought against the racially discriminatory policies of the whites. In India, as a reformer, he fought against social injustices, tyrannies and oppressions. But primarily he was engaged in abolishing the unjust economic and political exploitation of India. Marx fought against the reactionary policies of the Prussian Government, engaged for a time in the Revolution of 1848, organized and led the First International and concentrated on bringing about 1.

According to Gandhi the enemy was foreign- imperialism, according to Marx it was bourgeois capitalism. Gandhi challenged the foundations of modern civilization. The sophisticated technological, secularistic, aggressive and lustful aspects of modern western civilization repelled him.1 It was equivalent to darkness and disease. He provided a return to nature like Plato, Rou- sseau and Tolstoy. Earlier than Spengler he prophesied the decline and doom of western civilization but he had tremendous faith in the rejuvenating power of the human spirit. Gandhi preached a return to simplicity. In the -context of modern India he appeared as a ruralist but in his later writings it appears he was only opposed to the perversi- ties of modern engineering and technology. He stood for safe-guarding the integrity and foundations of the villages. He felt that India lived in the villages. Hence his slogan "Back to the village" was notan abstraction or a reactionary trend. Even the Marxists have recognised that a balance l¡ias to be established between the rural and the urban centres. The growth of big megalopolitan centres has been also conde- mned in the West. Like some of the other western sociologists, Gandhi felt that a strengthened and economically sound village economy would revitalize our democracy. In the Charkha he found not the symbol of crudeness but the means and instrument of helping our people in at least getting the barest morsel of food. The Marxist programme is different. Marxism grew as the creed of the western industrial world. The workers suffering under the injus- tices of the early years of industrial capitalism found in it a gospel of emancipation. Marx worked out a philosophy of history." The forces of production were the ultimate determinants. Sometimes we find in Marxist writings the equating of the forces of production with techno- logy but most often it is interpreted in ä broad sense.* History moves through the struggles and strifes of divergent classes that grow up in correspondence with the forces of production. According to the Marxist logic, history is moving towards the destruction of the present capitalist society. Capitalism engenders in its womb the deep and profound contradictions that lead to its extinction. Capitalism has rendered great service to man. It has released undreamt of productive forces i .

According to Sombart, Masaryk and Hansen, Marxism accepts a technological interpretaion of history but Engels, Bernstein, Cunow and Lenin interpret the phrase "forces of production1' in a broader sense.</page><page sequence="11">GANDHI AND MARX 125 and It has rationalized society and technology but it fails to reconcile the mode and the relations of production. Private ownership .of the means of production produces an irrational social structure characterized by the falling tendency of the rate of profit and increasing exploitation and immiserisation ( Verelendung ) of the working classes making inevi- table the bursting asunder of the capitalist system.1 Marx did not provide any detailed outline of socialist economics. He appeared as a prophet of the decline of capitalist political economy which he consi- dered iniquitous because it was based on the profit motive. He claimed to criticise capitalism not on moral grounds which he considered Utopian but on scientific grounds of reason. Capitalism would die because it is infected by the cancer of numerous contradictions. There is the con- tradiction between concentration and centralization of capital at one pole and the amassing of human misery on the other; there is contra- diction between the simultaneous existence of overproduction and economic crises and furthermore there is the contradiction between technological rationality operating in the factory and the chaotic stru- cture of a polarized society. Hence there is the need of socialism of abundance which will organize the free and equal association of produ- cers which will lead to the augmentation and equitable distribution of social capital. Marx is opposed to the fetishism of commodities in the capitalist society based on the extortion of surplus value. It is the labouring class which creates values, but the surplus is appropriated by the exploiters. The detailed division of labour creates minute areas of action and converts man into an automaton who has lost all aesthetic charm in his creative work and hence this division of labour should be replaced by the system which will produce the multi-sided man. The capitalist practice of calculation in terms of monetary profit should be replaced by calculation in terms of labour. Marx's role as a prophet appears in the passages of the first volume of the Capital where with bitter passion he mercilessly exposes the vandalism of early colonialism and original capitalist accumulation. He describes the terror and grimness of the havoc let loose on the masses of people by the capitalistic system of industry. Though the labour and the surplus value theories have been unacceptable to the Austrian marginal utility school of economics," and though the vera- city of several of the conclusions of Marx in the realm of theorerical i.

His insights are correct to the extent that even the prophets of rugged individualism are now compromising with forms of socialism, social justice or at least a partially socialized economy. Marx's learning in the field of theoretical economics has been testified to even by non- communist economists, and it is significant that J. Schumpeter has accepted the truths of some of Marx's analyses.1 But the singular services that Marx has rendered is that his better denunciations have been eye-openers to the glaring inequalities and maldistribution of wealth in modern society. The relation between man and his bread is eternal. His bread may not determine his thought but he must have bread and plenty of that. Both Gandhi and Marx have succeeded because they have busied themselves with providing the solution to this eternal problem - How every body will be provided with bread ! If according to Marx capitalists are robbers because they extract surplus value according to the Gandhian expositions of 'Asteya' any body who has more than he barely needs, is a thief. Marx challenges the theory and practice of capitalist accumulation." Gandhi challenges accu- mulation in all its shapes.* All the great prophets in history have been socialists in this sense. Jesus Christ was a socialist and Ram Tirtha was a socialist. Dayananda and Vivekananda were socialists. Gandhi emphasized not only the social settlement of the iniquities of wealth but he wanted to cure the drive towards avarice and lust which is the chief criminal in creating an unequal society. But although both Gandhi and Marx are opposed to the capitalistic' processes of social and economic exploitation, their emphases are on different points. Gandhi is a moral and spiritual individualist. The individual seeking to better his character by moral technics is the starting point of Gandhian ethics. Marx, inheriting the Hellenic and first volume of Capital and the price of production theory upheld by him in the third volume of Capital . G. D. H. Cole in What Marx Really Meant and Paul Sweezy in The Theory of Capitalist Development Chapter vii, try to minimise and even to repudiate the question of the contradiction but to me it seems that Cole and Sweezy do not succeed m their attempt.

Refer to the commentary of Mahatma Gandhi on Asteya in his booklet Mangal- Pmbhat ( in Hindi ).</page><page sequence="13">GANDHI AND MARX 127 the Hegelian traditions of the significance of the collectivity accepts that not an appeal to the sentiment of justice by individual self- sacrifice but organized expropriation by the armed proletariat of the exproprietors would destroy the evils of society. Gandhi thinks that the root of the malady is deeper. Not individual wealth but the individualistic propensity towards the acquisition of wealth is the central devil. Not the elimination of the actual amount of the quantities of commodities but the suppression of the drive towards the avaricious accumulation and monopolistic pòssession of things that may be and are needed by others, would bring the millenium. He is not opposed to institutional changes. He did believe in changes in the structure of society and politics. His career offers the momen- tous example of a lone individual challenging the Union of South Africa and the Empire of Britain. But he would not consider structural changes to be sufficient. Like Buddha he believed that the enemy has to be converted into a colleague and helper. Just as Aristotle in his critique of Phaleas of Chalcedon and Hippodamus pointed out that man's moral faculties have to be ennobled and sole reliance should not be placed on surface external changes in the outward organizations, so also Gandhi wanted not only the end of the British regime and of the Indo-British capitalistic and feudal exploitation of society but the final elimination of the desire to exploit. A really classless society based on mutual active love and harmony was his goal. But Marx will say that the people who hold property now, do not have any inviolable right to it in terms of it being the result of their labour. He will not endorse Proudhon's statement that property is theft but at the same time he would think that the capitalistic extortion of the surplus is tinged with the blood of proletariat. Any increase in the commodities constituting capital represents a corresponding extortion of unpaid labour from the working class. There is no absolute moral right of the capitalist to his wealth and hence there is no justification why the working class would confine itself to the "Sermon on the Mount." There is realism in what Marx says. It appeals to our youthful sentiment to get the thing quickly done. We are tempted to quote the Bhagvadgita with its doctrine of Dharmayuddha to support Marx. Asiatic intellectuals will cite the supreme example of the Russian Revolution and possibly of the Chinese Revolution as indications of the strength of the exploited classes. But the question about the efficacy of the Gandhian formula is not merely moral. Gandhi, of course condemned violence because in what- soever a form it may be, it is bound to generate future violence. But there is also a practical side to the Gandhian technique and it is wrong</page><page sequence="14">128 VISHWANATH PRASAD VARMA to consider it merely a variant of Owenism. The question is : Is violent revolution against the capitalistic class going to succeed ? What gua- rantee is there that the united workers of the U. S. A. will overthrow American capitalism ? It does not mean that violence is all immoral. Violence be advocated in cases where great interests are at stake, e. g. personal security or the honour of one's family or any other issue of that type. But it is not possible to advocate the violent overthrow of the pre- sent system because the chances of its successes are remote. The modern method of technology and science have placed immense military power in the hands of the capitalist state and hence if the workers and the peasants advocate forcible overthrow they will, the chances greatly are, fail. Hence it is not possible to deride the Gandhian programme of organisation, peaceful agitation, non-cooperation and non-violent civil disobedience in the cause of the overthrow of any unjust social, economic and political system, as chimerical and visionary.1 There, are people who advocate that the parties upholding righteous and just cause should have armed power superior to the party to whom they attribute a less just cause. But here also the question is one of efficacy and feasibility of violent means. It is not always possible that the party representa- ting a just cause, can have superior armed power. Hence at least as a policy, although not as a permanent creed, Gandhian technics have a lot to teach to the modern world. (v) Philosophy of Politics. In a sense, both Gandhi and Marx are anarchists. Gandhi considered the state as an organization of violence and force. He postulated that in the ideal state of Ramarajya, there will be the sovereignty of the moral authority of the people and the state as a machin* of violence would be extinct. But he was not for the immediate ending of the state power. Increasing perfection of the state should be the immediate goal although the ultimate aim is philosophical and moral anarchism. According to Marx, the capitalistic state would be replaced by the proletarian dictatorship. It would be the first phase of communism.« The dictatorship of the proletariat would be the highest concentration of state power. It will build the foundations for the ultimate classless society. The communist society will be the second phase of com- munism. Since according to Marx, the state is the child of social exploitation consequent on the growth of commodity production, the I.

The idealistic character of both Gandhism and Marxism is apparent in their anarchistic philosophy. Of course, distinguished from the Stirner-Bakunin-Kropotkin conceptions of anarchism, Marxism does not advocate the deliberate destruction of the state machine but only its gradual withering away. Anarchism represents a reaction against the injustices of the nineteenth century capitalist state. The terrific in- iquities of the state system in Russia led to the growth of Russian nihilism and anarchism. Although in the British Godwin, in the American Tucker and iii the German Stirner we find anarchistic ideas, still anarchism is a characteristically Russian phenomenon1. Although Gandhi referred to the Dharmarajya and the Ramarajya, the anarchistic theory of Gandhi represents the influence of the moral anarchism of Tolstoy upon him and is not to be traced in the ancient literature of India, [as for example, in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata where we find the ideals of the Ramarajya and Dharmarajya]. In a funda- mental sense, anarchism is a religious ideology and its roots go back to the religious condemnation of the state as an institution of sin, conse- quent upon the fall of man from the state of resplendent grace. The variants of anarchism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries are secularized versions of this ancient- gospel. Hence we find that in postulating the final ideal of anarchism, the spiritualist teachings of Gandhi and the materialistic teachings of Marx join hands. ( vi ) Philosophy of Freedom. Gandhi was not a philosopher of history. But if we reconstruct his scattered ideas into a philosophy of history we find that he accepts theological determinism. He said that he literally believed that not a leaf moves without sanction from the divine. Carried to its extreme limits a theological determinism can lead to Occasionalism. Gandhi believed that in the ultimate sense, God or truth being the final reality and the omnicompetent being, it was the supreme determinant of things and movements in the world. But determinism in Gandhi applied only to the final explanation of things. It never degenerated into fatalism, He was a strong advocate of the strenous activism and energism of the Gita. His whole life was full of ceaseless actions, all inspired by the artistic vision of a spiritual whole which imparted a higher meaning to his diverse actions as a social worker, a journalist, a political leader and a moral prophet. Hence Gandhi combined a faith in the supre- i. N. Berdyaev : The Origin of Russian Ccmmunism p. 65,</page><page sequence="16">13 o VISHWANATH PRASAD V ARMA macy of God with the insistence on constant action. He never accepted the theory of absolute freedom for man. Freedom for him lay not in the egoistic assertions of the claims of the individual ego but in identi- fication with the spiritual being. Freedom means realization of the moral self. Hence he stressed the rigid adherence to the code of Mahavrata ( the eleven great vows ) in his Ashrama. To Gandhi free- dom was a whole. Moral freedom from the slavery to passions, national freedom from the bondage of alien rulers and exploiters, and spiritual freedom from the demands of nature were all phases of freedom. To one whose life was permeated by the belief in the presence of a higher spiritual reality, any compromise with evil, lust and slavery was wrong. Hence Gandhi advocated a return to simplicity and nature. He opposed large-scale industrialism and mechanization. He was not a complete ruralist advocating an unmitigated return to village Arca- dianism. It is true, he condemned western commercialism, imperialism and secularism as disease. But later on, we find him realistic enough, at least in the context of the future Indian society, advocating a recon- ciliation of large-scale and small-scale industries,' the nationalization of key-industries, and the organization of urban centres not as lop-sided outgrowths but functioning as catering to the interests of the village where the real soul of India lay. He was not even opposed to rural electrification. Thus we see that Gandhi's great gospel was that freedom is a whole. In western psychology and philosophy there has been created an unhealthy separation of the different forms of freedom : the metaphysical freedom of the human self against cosmic necessity; the psychological theorie^ of freedom of will and action; and the discussions about the reconciliation of individual political freedom and social authority. Gandhi's attitude was integral. To him freedom was a process of growth in quest of an articulated system of coherent moral purposes and actions. A man who obtains freedom over his passions would not tolerate the social and economic exploitation of his neigh- bours because they are really his own selves. He would not be bound down to the creeds and conventions of a particular society or nation but would embrace mankind, nay all living beings, in a fraternal emb- race. Gandhi's life was a vindication, a supreme concretization of the great Vedantic gospel that a man of realization transcends not only hate and sorrow bůt also all separatist differences and the consciousness of finite claims and the just apportionment of his dues. There is the realization of unity and supreme freedom. Marx received from the scientific rationalism of France and Germany the belief in the stupendous power of reason to create a better society</page><page sequence="17">GANDHI AND MARX 131 and a happier future for man. To this extent, Marx was a product of the Renaissance spirit. He stated that by harnessing the powers and capacities of the mind, increasing rationalization of the socio-economic process was possible. Nature was not to be prepritiated as a power of God but should be conquered. The dialectical use of human reason would reveal to man the splendours of freedom. Freedom according to Marx means the accentuation of rationality entailing the consequent transmutation of the necessity writ large upon the face of nature into freedom. Large-scale planning would create the condition whereby increased production with less amount of work would be possible.1 Marx was a child of the scientific bourgeois technological civilization of the capitalistic west. He prescribed not the Platonic limitation of needs and wants as Gandhi did, but the use of mechanized power for catering to the needs not of selfish groups but of the entire collectivity. In Marxism the conception of freedom as rational knowledge and control of necessity is important. The prophetic appeals to control over human passions as the means to freedom, we do not find in him. He hoped that with the increasing perfection of the socialist society human nature would undergo a transformation and there would be the consequent emergence of a new type of socialized man - the man rid of religious superstitions and egoistic characteristics, who would be interested in a programme of fraternity and comradeship. In Marx the gospel of social actionism and titanism is strong." The belief in the powers of man, society and science is stupendous. But notwithstanding the several references to man as the creator of history and the transformer of nature that we find in the writings of Marx, his belief is in a deterministic philosophy. By an inexorable powerful logic and momentum history is supposed to be working towards a resolution of the social drama, in i. la the Chapter entitled ''The Trinitarian Formula" in the third volume of Capital pp. 954-955 occurs a very important passage : "In fact the realm of freedom does not commence until the point is passed where labour under the compulsion of neces- sity and of external utility is required .... The freedom in this field cannot consist of anything else but of the fact that socialized man, the associated producers, regulate their interchange with nature rationally, bring it under their common control, instead of being ruled by it as by some blind power; that they accomplish their task with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most adequate to their human nátuře and most worthy of it. But it always remains a realm of necessity. Beyond it begins that development of human power, which is its own end, the true realm of freedom, which however can flourish only upon that realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of the working day is its fundamental premise." Cf. Engels : Anti-Duhring p. 125, ''Freedom therefore consists in the control over ourselves and over external nature which is founded on knowledge of natural necessity." 2.

According to Marx, not the mere colossality of human or social action succeeds, but the conformity of action to the demands and ways of historical logic is the criterion of success. This requires a dialectical knowledge of world history and philosophy and economics. Hence Marx formulates broad laws of history which are assumed to operate in the totality of the historical structure. At the present hour the historical laws are supposed to move with a deterministic finalistic certainty to the victory of the labouring class and hence the latter have to organize, to battle and to win their destined freedom and emancipation. The philosophy of dialectical and historical materialism claims to have interpreted the world and its movements and the only thing it prescribes is action oriented to broad social changes and even armed revolution. The basic concepts in the Marxist philosophy of history and politics are freedom, reason, science, and revolution. A comprehensive philosophy of freedom will accept an integral view. We need social freedom from the restraints of the feudal aristrocats and ecclesiasticism. We need political freedom from alien rulers and from a too centralized bureaucratic regime. Political freedom can become a reality only by close and active participation of citizens in the political process. Without a substantial economic equality there are acute dangers of the invasion of politics by money. In order that man may not be tempted to abuse his freedom he requires discipline and self- restraint. He needs moral training as well as advancement of scientific and social reason. Gandhi has emphasized national freedom arçd psy- chological integration of personality. Marx stresses socio-economic freedom and dialectical cognition. The two standpoints need to be harmonised so that they may get over their inadequacies and become perfected. 3, CONCLUSION : THE NEED OF A SYNTHESIS. Gandhi is a saint and a moral revolutionary. He stresses the moral bankruptcy of modern civilization and prescribes the sanctity of ethical substance and criteria. He thinks that a peaceful solution of our problems is not only possible but also the only way to have a real solution. Marx wants a radical change in the social structure even by resort to force. Gandhi is a realist with the occasional touch of the celestial prophet and the ethereal mystic in him. Marx is a dynamic fighter trying once more in history to revive the laws of Moses. In the name of the emancipation of the proletariat he thinks it wise to take a tooth for a tooth and a nail for a nail. Marx is a thinking realist and a man of action. He never forgave the people who in any way sought</page><page sequence="19">GANDHI AND MARX 133 to take advantage of him. His vitriolic polemics against Proudhon, Lassalle and Bakunin are integral portions of the proletariat history. Gandhi, the angelic saint forgave his opponents, and even the men who physically assaulted and even murdered him. Marx saw deep, Gandhi's visions were deeper. There is the possibility that Marx's dreams may be realized at least in some more countries. On the realization of the Gandhian plans, depends human peace, freedom- and culture. Both Gandhi and Marx have been the determined spokesmen of the aspira- tions of suppressed humanity and therein lies the secrets of their great success. Regardless of the attacks levelled by Böhm Bawerk, the German historical school of economics, Max Weber and John Dewey, the name of Marx creates a legendary hope in the minds and hearts of the exploited. Notwithstanding the opposition of the liberals, the British army and bureaucracy and local extremists Gandhi wrought the most radical political transformation in Indian history. Is it too idealistic to hope that we can find a way to synthetize the ethical absolutism of Gandhi with the emphasis of Marx on the immediate and radical solution of the economic problem in favour of the exploited classes ? If the social realism of Marx and the ethical purism of Gandhi can be reconciled the world will be happier1. i. For further suggestions and comparative analysis see V. P.
