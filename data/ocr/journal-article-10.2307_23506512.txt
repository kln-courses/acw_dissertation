<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOLOMON MAIMON'S PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE CRITICALLY EXAMINED SAMUEL ATLAS Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion M AI MON himself has outlined for us the development of his philosophical career, thus revealing the sources which have left their impress on his thought. In a paper which was published post humously1 Maimon speaks of three stages in his philosophical develop ment; each of them marked by the impact of a different personality. In the first period he was under the influence of Maimonides. From Maimonides he learnt the difference between the literal and the figurative meanings of Biblical expressions, i. e., between the apparent and the real meaning of the scriptural terms. The first part of the chief philosophical work of Maimonides, More Nebuchim, is devoted to an analysis of the allegorical, the homonymie, and the hybrid terms in Scriptures. The belief in human reason as the determining agent for distinguishing between terms which are to be understood in a literal sense and those which are to be interpreted figuratively, constitutes the basis of Maimonides' rationalism. The real meaning of the scrip tural terms referring to God and to the divine attributes can be established solely by means of rational processes. Thus the apparent contradictions between faith and reason are resolved by Maimonides in favor of the latter. The harmony between the two spheres, faith and reason, is not to be attained by admitting two legitimate, distinct realms, each having different aims and purposes, but by recognizing their essential unity. The striving for unity is an essential character istic of rationalism in general and of Maimonidean rationalism in particular. Hence, not an armistice between faith and reason but a harmonious unity between them is the goal. Maimonides' rationalistic approach to the Bible, by interpreting the biblical terms referring to God in a manner compatible with rationality, constitutes a philosophy of language forming an integral part of Maimonides' philosophy of being and of God. Since a metaphysical conception of the world and of God must take the form of language, which is often an inadequate medium of expression of the transcendent realm, a philosophy of being 1 Solomon Maimons Geschichte seiner philosophischen Autorschaft in Dialogen.

It is one of the inherent, even tragic, difficulties of philosophy in general that it is compelled to express metaphysical ideas by means of lan guage generally associated with the vulgar, common, and sensuous meaning of terms. In other words, the tragedy of philosophy consists in the fact that it must use non-philosophic language as a medium for expressing ideas and concepts transcending the sensuous. Maimon writes that the teaching of Maimonides concerning the distinction to be made between proper and improper expressions, the teaching that those biblical passages the literal meaning of which does not harmonize with rational thought must be figuratively interpreted, provoked a revolution in Maimon's mind. By this reconciliation between faith and reason, Maimon was liberated from the bonds which dogmatic faith imposes on reason. Faith could now become more and more rational. Maimon thus liberated himself from the fetters of dogmatic theology and could now proceed undisturbed freely to exert his mind toward attaining a higher level for understanding reality and man. This revolution was concerned originally with reli gious concepts and ideas.2 We shall see later, how this method of interpreting linguistic terms stood Maimon in good stead in the realm of epistemology, and particularly with reference to his conception of the "thing in itself." In the second period of his development Maimon stood under the spell of Leibnitz and Wolff. Maimon writes that, from Wolff (through whom, as the expositor of Leibnitz, Maimon came to Leibnitz) Maimon learnt the formal distinction between clear and distinct concepts and confused concepts. This gave his thought a new impulse; it kindled a a new light in his mind. Maimon then felt the need to subject to redefinition, in accordance with the requirements of Wolff, the whole stock of concepts which he had taken for granted, and not one of them could stand the test. His striving after clear and distinct definitions evoked in him, as Maimon himself writes, a "mania for definitions." Everything, even the best known concepts, had to be redefined.3 And finally, the decisive influence on his thought was that of Kant, which constitutes the third period in his development. Maimon holds this to consist in his having learnt from Kant to distinguish between formal thought and real thought. That is to say, between thought which is governed by the mere formal principles of logic, to which any object of thought as such is subject, and the process of thought aiming at the cognition of objects of reality. The first is 1 Ibid., p. 137. 3 Ibid., p. 139.</page><page sequence="3">[3] SOLOMON MAIMON'S PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE 255 analytic and the second synthetic, and the latter cannot be fully determined by, nor derived from, the former. By the formal laws of logic, which is indispensable for any object of thought, it is impossible to attain cognition of objects of reality. The distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions, which Kant considered worthy of being called "classic," consists in the recognition that objects of reality cannot be cognized and determined by formal logical principles. In this, Maimon maintains, lay the decisive influence of Kant on his thought. Maimon, however, deviated from Kant in that he considered the transcendental logic of Kant, which established principles of experience in general (iiberhaupt), i. e. principles of thought without which experience as such would be impossible, also to belong to formal thought, which cannot determine the cognition of this or that par ticular object of reality. From the principles of thought which are necessary and indispensable for experience in general, there cannot be derived the cognition of particular objects of experience. In this respect Maimon fundamentally deviates from Kant. But the distinc tion between formal thought and real thought as such, Maimon learnt, by his own admission, from Kant. He extended, however, the area of formal thought to include also the principles of transcendental logic. The sketch by Maimon of the various phases of his philosophical development is presented in the form of a dialogue consisting of questions and answers between himself and a reviewer. To the ques tion: "Did you not grant to the various doctrines a much wider scope, thus comprehending them in a different manner than implied in their original conception?" Maimon's reply was in the affirmative. The harmony between faith and reason, according to Maimon, is nothing other than the total subordination of the former to the latter. There fore, the "transcendent" meaning of the concept of speech, inter preted figuratively, implies nothing more than that which causes the generation of certain ideas in the human mind. Since God, as pure spirit, could not have any organ of speech and could not, therefore, speak in a manner accessible to perception by the senses, the expression "God spoke to Moses" means simply that in Moses' mind arose certain ideas the first cause of which was conceived to be God, as He is the first cause of all things. But, in this way, God speaks to every one who has attained rational thought to a high degree. By the "transcendent meaning of the concept of speech" is to be understood the ideal implied in the term, often to be attained by its figurative interpretation rather than through its literal meaning. Here we have the clue to the understanding of Maimon's philosophy of language and to the influence of Maimonides on its formulation.</page><page sequence="4">256 SAMUEL ATLAS [4] By way of analogy it can be said that, as according to the generally accepted biological notion, the developing human embryo recapitulates the previous history of the species, so Maimon recapitulates, in his own philosophical doctrines, the history of his previous development. Maimon went through a development of various phases in his philo sophical thinking from Maimonides to Wolff, Leibnitz and Spinoza, and from these to Kant and Hume. Ideas of all of them entered into the web of his own speculative constructions. Vestiges of the various systems can be detected in his criticism of others as well as in his own philosophical doctrines and can be traced back to their roots and sources. II It was Maimon's habit to treat a philosophical problem in various connections and in different contexts. Hence we often encounter in his writings repetitions of the same ideas. However, while Maimon re mains, on the whole, consistent in the development of the main trends of his thought, there are always to be found, in his various investigations, some new angles and new aspects of the self-same problem in accordance with the varying contexts. The same applies to Maimon's treatment of the philosophy of language. This problem is dealt with by Maimon in his Versuch iiber die die Transcendentalphilosophie, pp. 293-332; in Streifereien im Gebiete derder Philosophie, in the section, "Ober die philosophischen und rhe torischen Figuren," p. 247 ff; in his Hebrew Commentary to the Moreh NebuchimNebuchim of Maimonides, especially in the first chapters; in his Lebensgeschichte,Lebensgeschichte, II, pp. 18 ff.; and finally in an essay, "Die philo sophische Sprachverwirrung" (in: Philosophisches Journal, 1797, Heft III, pp. 213-258)/ Every language contains terms and expressions which have a literal meaning and a figurative meaning. Such terms are called tropes. It is the task of a philosophy of language to search for a real definition of the tropes. For that purpose it is necessary to establish the relation between the figurative and inadequate meaning of the terms and their literal meaning. Then it is necessary to find out what are the essential features of the inadequate, figurative expressions. By obtaining a clear concept of the essence of the figurative terms, we shall gain under 4 The essay of Maimon: "Was sind Tropen?" which appeared in Journal fiir Aufkldrung,Aufkldrung, 5. Band, 2 Stuck, p. 162-179, forms in its entirety a part of Tran scendentalphilosophie, p. 303-317.</page><page sequence="5">[5] SOLOMON MAIMON's PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE 257 standing of the reason for their rise in our mind and for their usage. For the attainment of this goal, Maimon proposes the following pro positions: First, the employment of a figurative term for the désigna tion of a concept or a percept must have an objective ground. That is to say, it must base itself on an object and not merely on subjective associations or impressions. The latter, in fact, presupposes the former; the subjective associations result from the perception of certain objective features. Furthermore, the mere similarity of the objects cannot furnish a sufficient reason for a figurative term. Similarity is no justification for the use of a term originally coined for an object, in a literal and adequate sense, to signify another object in a figurative and inadequate sense. The following consideration sustains the truth of this propo si tion. Let us suppose an object possessing the two properties a and b, the proper expression referring to this object is X. Then let us suppose another object possessing the two properties a and c. In consequence of the similarity of the two objects, to the extent that both of them possess the property a, the same term X is employed in a figurative and inadequate sense with regard to the object ac. Since, however, the similarity between the objects is the determining factor in employing the term X for both of them, the term X does not refer to the whole object ab, nor to the whole object ac, but only to the property a which is common to both, for otherwise its use in relation to the object ac would be fortuitous. Hence, the term X is equally proper and adequate with reference to the object ac and to the object ab, in so far as the property a is present in both objects. We must therefore seek another reason for the valid use of figurative expressions. Apart from the objective features such as similarity and dis similarity of the objects, there are subjective relations which determine the interrelation of the objects to each other. The terms used to signify the objects are grounded in the subjective as well as in the objective relations obtaining between them. By "subjective relations," however, are not meant the accidental and personal impressions re suiting from the mental state of the particular individual subject. The reference is to those relations which are grounded in the essential forms of human thought as such. Not the individual subject, but the human subject in general, with its forms of thought, is to be con sidered as the basis of a phenomenology of language. That is to say, the general forms of thought, without which no object is at all think• able, such as subject and accident, or substance and attribute, cause</page><page sequence="6">258 SAMUEL ATLAS [6] and effect, and the like, constitute the source from which certain phenomena of language are to be derived. Herein lies the ground for the derivation of figurative terms and expressions. Linguistic terms are always reducible to concepts, and concepts covering the relations of objects to one another are simply forms of thought applied to objects. Since figurative expressions always imply relational concepts, and relations are always reducible to the forms and categories of thought, we can determine the figurative expressions as grounded in the logical forms of thought. And since the logical forms are a priori principles, which are the necessary conditions of experience, the figurative expressions are grounded in a priori principles.5 It seems that it was Maimon's intention to explain the phenomenon of the figurative terms on the basis of what he conceived to be the essence of knowledge. The former is rooted in the latter. Maimon's conception of the scope and origin of knowledge provides an answer to the question concerning the origin of figurative terms. The fun damental principle of cognition, according to critical idealism, is that just as the general concept can be conceived only through the medium of the particular, so the particular can be cognized only in its relation to the general. There can be no cognition of the particular without conceiving it as a particular manifestation or a particular example of a general concept. And the figurative expressions are just as re ducible to the general a priori concepts of thought as are the percep tions of the objects of experience. Thus the figurative meaning and the literal meaning of the terms have a common ground. The figurative meaning is just as genuine and adequate as the literal meaning, since both of them have the same origin. The distinction between the literal and the figurative meaning of the terms is valid only for the primitive, non-philosophical consciousness. By a philosophical analysis of the terms, the common ground of the two meanings is revealed, namely, the logical forms of thought which are a priori principles; and the distinction between the literal and the figurative is thus invalidated. By detecting the logical form in which the terms are grounded, their "transcendental" meaning is discovered. And the literal as well as the figurative meanings are both reducible to the "transcendental" form of thought. Each language is replete with terms which refer to material things and to immaterial things, i. e., to objects perceived by the senses and to ideas conceived by the mind. Thus, for instance, the term "motion" 5 Cf. Versuch iiber die Transcendentalphilosophie, 1790, p. 305. Henceforth this work will be referred to as Tr.</page><page sequence="7">[7] SOLOMON MAIMON'S PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE 259 refers to the movement of a body and to the movement of the spirit, that is, to change of mind or of a mental disposition. The logical, "transcendental" form of the term "motion" in general is gradual continuity. In case of the motion of a body it is continuous change in relation to space; with reference to the motion of an idea, it is con tinuous transformation by a process in time. The "transcendental" meaning of the term implies a change or a variety of modifications in one and the same thing. With regard to a material object, the deter mination of motion refers to external modifications, i. e. the relation of an object to various objects in space. With regard to an ideational object, i. e. an idea, a disposition or a state of mind, the term "motion" signifies mental changes and spiritual modifications. The verb "to grasp" applies to the seizing of a material object as well as to the comprehension of an idea. The "transcendental" meaning of the term is the appropriation of an object and making it one's own; it may be a material object or an idea. We may interpret the tran scendental form of this verb by bringing it in relation to the category of unity. By an act of acquiring an object or an idea, the sphere and the domain of the subject is being enlarged, and greater unity is thus being established. The owning subject and the owned object (a material thing or an idea) stand in a relation of unity to one another. By an act of acquisition the subject and object are unified. By reducing the verb to a form of thought, its transcendental meaning is thus revealed. The word "to break" or "interrupt" signifies generally a disruption of a unity or of a gradual continuity. The unity may be of a material or of an immaterial nature. There is thus a unity of objects existing in space and a unity of processes occurring in time. The "transcendental" meaning of the verb "break" is the severance of a unity, or an act of negation of unity, either of an existing unity or of a possible unity. The interruption of the growth of a flower, for instance, means the disruption of a unity of the flower with the ground; it may also mean the checking of a continuous process of growth. In this case, a real unity in space is demolished or a potential continuous process in time is disrupted. The interruption of a speech or a process of thought implies the breaking of a possible unity which would have realized itself if its completion had been permitted. In this case the unity disrupted is that of a process occurring in time. The term "flowing" in its general, transcendental sense, means a continuous succession of the parts of an entity upon one another. With regard to a material entity, a fluid, for instance, the continuous succession of its parts takes place in time as well as in space. With regard to speech or thought, for example, the succession of its parts.</page><page sequence="8">260 SAMUEL ATLAS [8] one upon the other, can be thought of as taking place only in time. The Hebrew verb Akhol means eating as well as burning. The "transcendental" form of thought which is the underlying idea of the two applications of the verb, is the preservation of the existence of one thing by the destruction of another. The same can be said with regard to the English word "consume." This expression is there fore original and genuine in relation to the consumption of an object by fire as well as in relation to the consumption of food by animals. The fire is preserved by the consumption of inflammable material and the animals are preserved by the consumption of food. The expression "fire consumes wood" is, therefore, not something figurative and derivative but an original and genuine expression.6 It is generally assumed, on the basis of the historical conception of man and of the development of language, that the linguistic terms referring to material objects and to sensuous percepts are prior in time to the rise of the meaning of the same terms as they involve a reference to intellectual notions and abstract concepts. Hence the assumption, generally accepted, that the "transcendental" expres sions, i. e., the linguistic terms referring to material and to immaterial objects, are the result of a later development of language. These terms were originally and genuinely formed to signify material objects; only at a later time were they transferred from their original domain of sensuous objects to the realm of abstract ideas. The employment of these terms for the designation of intellectual and abstract concepts is not original with man but is an ideational superstructure produced by the later development of the human mind. Maimon, however, raises the following objections to such a view. First, the course of historical development of language cannot be definitely stated. It is by no means certain that the terms implying a figurative meaning were originally used only for the designation of sensuous and material objects and later transferred from their original and intrinsic domain to an intellectual domain where they were employed figuratively with regard to ideational objects. Since the perception of the particular and material objects presupposes the cognition of the general concept under which it is subsumed and by means of which it is recognized, the general concept could not have been derived from the perception of the particular. Furthermore, even granted that historically the sensuous meanings of the terms preceded in time the rise of their intellectual meanings, it does not necessarily ' Ibid., p. 307 ff.</page><page sequence="9">[9] SOLOMON MAIMON'S PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE 261 follow that these terms are derivatives and inadequate figuratives when they are used to signify intellectual concepts and immaterial objects. Being posterior in time is not a sufficient reason for considering the intellectual and ideational meaning of the term as non-intrinsic, figurative, or inadequate. Two central ideas bearing on the essence of critical idealism are involved in Maimon's criticism of the attempt to derive the nature of figurative terms from the historical development of language. Both ideas are grounded in the idealistic conception of the essence of cognition. First, the general concepts cannot be derived from the perception of particular objects. The perception of a particular object is impossible without relating it to a general concept. There can be no perception of an object without perceiving it as a particular pattern, example, or manifestation of a general concept. Every percept is always being related to concepts. But this does not mean that the general concepts have an existence of their own in our mind prior to, and independent of the particulars. Herein critical idealism differs fundamentally from metaphysical idealism which holds that the general concepts are prior in time to the perception of the particulars. Examples of metaphysical idealism are: Plato's Anamnesis and Descartes' Ideae Innatae. Kant designated Plato's idealism as an imaginary, illusory idealism (Schwàrmerischer Idealismus). In opposi tion to metaphysical, transcendent idealism, critical idealism main tains that the general concepts are conceived always in and through the particulars. There are no general ideas in our mind independent of experience; the general concepts do not exist prior to, and without the perception of the particulars. Nor are we justified in assuming the metaphysical, ontological reality of the general concepts. In opposition to positivism and all shades of sensualism, which maintains that the general concepts result from abstracting the per ceptions of the particulars, critical idealism holds that the particular objects are always perceived as particulars of general concepts. The latter are always contained in the former. In other words, there are no percepts without a relation to concepts. Just as the concepts are not prior in time to the percepts, the percepts do not precede in time the concept. Paraphrasing a famous saying of Kant we can say: percepts without concepts are lame and blind and concepts without percepts are empty and inane. The second idea which bears on the understanding of critical idealism, Maimon disclosed in his rejection of the argument from the historical development of language. This argument proves the fig urative and inadequate nature of the immaterial and intellectual</page><page sequence="10">262 SAMUEL ATLAS [10] meaning of terms from the historical fact that the material sense preceded in time the rise of the intellectual and immaterial sense. Maimon maintains that being posterior in time is not a sufficient reason for considering the intellectual meaning of the term as non genuine, figurative, and inadequate. The criticism levelled against idealism by sensualism and em piricism, based on the consideration of the historical development of man, we encounter through the ages. Locke's writings are replete with argument against idealism on the basis of anthropology and history. The fact that savages do not have general ideas and that children are born without them is for Locke the strongest argument against idealism in general and against Descartes' ideae innatae in particular. Locke's arguments, however, are valid only on the assump tion that the innate ideas are ready-made concepts in a biological, psychological sense, i. e. that these ideas constitute a natural aspect of man, given to man at his birth alongside his other senses. But the innate ideas should rather be understood in the sense that they arise in the human mind in and through the process of cognition. In the struggle of man with the problems of reality, in his striving for order and unity, the general concepts are generated, i. e., born, in his mind. In every stage of the scientific, comprehensive knowledge of the world, as attained by man, there are contained therein innate ideas without which we cannot account for the systematic cognition of reality. The historical fact that man, prior to his attaining the stage of scientific consciousness resulting in a comprehensive cognition of reality as a whole, was in a state of intellectual innocence, and that, as a sensuous being, he had a relation to the surrounding world exclusively through the medium of his senses, does not prove that the general concepts are non-genuine and are but derivations by way of abstraction from the perceptions of the particulars. Nor does it prove that the terms referring to immaterial objects and ideational concepts are figuratives, non-genuine, and inadequate. Ill The treatment by Maimon of the relational term "outside," "outer," or "beyond" deserves special consideration because of the close relationship which obtains between the reduction of this term to its transcendental and logical form and Maimon's conception of the "thing in itself," as I shall try to show. The meaning of the rela tional term "outside" or "beyond," according to Maimon, depends on whether it refers to material things or to immaterial things. With</page><page sequence="11">[11] SOLOMON MAIMON' S PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE 263 regard to material objects, the term "outside" implies an external determination of space. With reference to concepts or ideas, it means beyond the limits of a certain ideal structure, where it is determined by internal methods corresponding to the nature of the ideas or concepts concerned.7 Since the term does not always mean outside or beyond a certain object in space, but may also mean beyond the limits of a certain logical structure, the general and "transcendental" concept of the term implies beyond the limits of a given entity. In case of an entity of a material nature the term "outside" means beyond the spatial limits of an object; in case of an ideational entity it means beyond the limits of a mental and logical structure. Now Maimon's analysis of the various meanings of the term "outside" or "beyond" has, so it seems to me, a bearing on the concept of the "thing in itself" as it was understood by Maimon. The Kantian distinction between the noumena and the phenomena was generally taken to imply that the former constitute the reality underlying the appearances. The noumena affect the phenomena•, in other words: the "things in themselves" are the causes of the appearances. Only the latter are accessible to cognition, i. e. determinations by the forms of thought. The noumena which are not determinable by the forms of thought are, as things in themselves, "outside" and "beyond" the phenomena in an ontological sense. They are entities per se outside the realm of experiential objects which alone are subject to the cat egorization by the forms of understanding. While, in relation to the phenomena, the principle of identity of subject and object holds good according to critical idealism, (there is no subject without a relation to objects and there is no object without a subject), in relation to the noumena, the principle of identity is not valid. This is implied in the formulation of the noumena as entities per se, i. e., they have to be thought of as standing in no relation to a subject and its forms of understanding. With such a conception of the noumena, it can even be maintained that they are "outside" the phenomena in a spatial sense. The noumena cannot be thought of as being in space, since space is itself a form of sensibility. But, more than this, they are "outisde" the objects of experience, i. e., outside the phenomena which are in space. Being outside and beyond the realm of objects in space is a spatial determination in a negative sense. Maimon, however, understood the idea of a thing in itself in an exclusively immanent sense, namely, that those perceptions of an ' Ibid., p. 309.</page><page sequence="12">264 SAMUEL ATLAS [12] object which are not ordered and mastered by the mind are to be designated as the "thing in itself." In other words, those elements of consciousness which are not categorized by the forms of thought constitute the noumenon, the thing in itself. The noumena are thus "outside" the phenomena not in a spatial sense but in an exclusively intellectual, immanent sense. It does not mean that the things in themselves have an ontological, transcendent reality existing in itself "outside" the appearances. Rather does the concept of a thing in itself imply the cognition of a limit between categorized and un categorized consciousness. The appearances which are comprehended and ordered by the forms of thought constitute the realm of experience. Those elements of our consciousness in relation to an object which are not yet rationally ordered and mastered by the categories of thought are "beyond" and "outside" the realm of appearances in a purely mental and immanent sense. Thus the term "outside" in its "transcendental" sense denotes merely: beyond the limits of a certain entity. The nature of the limits will vary according to the nature of the object referred to. The limits will be of a spatial nature when the delimited entity is a material object in space; they will be of a mental, ideational nature when the object described is an object of thought, an immanent idea of consciousness. In another context8 Maimon deals with the question, how it is possible for the human mind to recognize an idea of an object as being grounded in a really existing thing "outside" the mind, and thus to distinguish between that which is in us, namely, a mere modification of the subject, and that which is "outside of us." And Maimon defines the meaning of the term "outside of us" thus: "The statement that a thing exists outside of us means only that we consider the idea of the object as something different and distinct from the thinking subject. Whether the idea of the object is in itself merely a modification of the subject, i. e. a mere subjective idea, or whether it is grounded in an objective reality actually existing outside us, is undetermined by this definition of the meaning of the term 'outside of us.' This is a question the solution of which depends on philosophical consid erations concerning the essence and potency of human cognition. But the definition of the concept 'outside of us,' as implying merely the distinction between the idea of an object and the thinking subject, must be considered as the general meaning of the term 'outside of us,' independent of the solution of the philosophical question concern 1 See Magazin zur Erfahrungsseelenkunde, 1793, Band 10, Stuck 3, p. 121 ff.</page><page sequence="13">[13] SOLOMON MAIMON'S PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE 265 ing the scope and possibility of the human mind to recognize the object as actually existing 'outside of the mind.' " It is of historical and philosophical interest to recall a similar analysis of the relational concept "outside" in connection with the idea of a "thing in itself" by a thinker contemporary with Maimon, and to compare the conclusions each of them has drawn from this linguistic analysis. Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, a famous physicist and philosopher, and an admirer and follower of Kant, has analyzed the distinction between the Latin terms "extra nos" and "praeter nos" with reference to the definition of a "thing in itself."9 We shall see that the similarity of their initial analysis of the terms "outside of us" and "beyond us" did not prevent their reaching totally different conclusions concerning the conception of a "thing in itself" and its place in a critical system of thought. Lichtenberg raises the question, how we at all come to the notion of something outside of us, since all our sensations and perceptions are occurrences taking place in our consciousness. The assertion that we sense something existing outside of us involves a contradiction. Since all our sensations occur within us, they are merely modifications of our inner selves. The concept of a reality existing outside of us seems to be grounded in the following reason : As we realize that the changes and the modifications of our consciousness are not dependent on us and on our inner self, we ascribe them to the effect of things outside of us or of our senses ; we thus state that there are things outside of us. We should, however, state merely praeter nos; but we substitute extra for praeter, which is something entirely different. The two terms are not the same. While praeter nos means merely something which is different from ourselves, thus delimiting the area of our inner self, extra extra nos implies a positive assertion of the reality of things in space outside of us. "This is not due to any direct and immediate sensation but seems to be grounded in the nature of our sensuous capacity; it is the form in which the notion of praeter nos is given to us." In other words, the substitution of extra for praeter results necessarily from the constitution of sensibility. Furthermore, Lichtenberg proceeds, "We can perhaps present the matter in the following way. We possess a capacity for receiving impressions; this is what we call sensibility. By this faculty we are conscious of the modifications occurring in us. The causes of these modifications we designate as objects. ... We are always conscious » See Lichtenberg, Georg Christoph, Vermischte Schriften, Leipzig, 1844. Vol. I, p. 84 ff.</page><page sequence="14">266 SAMUEL ATLAS [14] of the state of our inner self, our soul. This capacity is our inner sense. When we assert: 'this occurs in me', we experience it by our inner sense. In this experience we are at one and the same time the observed thing and the observing mind, object and subject alike. We are also having impressions of which we are convinced that we are merely the receiving subject, not the object. It would perhaps be right to maintain that these objects are praeter nos, which denotes only that we are conscious of something different from ourselves. This would be the only possible way adequately to express our actual experience. But how does the transformation from praeter nos into extra nos take place, namely the change from the realization of something different from ourselves into the presentation of something existing beyond us in space? This seems to result from a necessary requirement of our very nature. Since the presentation of objects existing in space is a necessary and indispensable condition of our capacity for sensibility, it cannot be derived from experience, for no experiential proposition implies necessity. We must think of space as infinite, but we cannot experience it as such. Granted that there are notions independent of experience, that of the extension of bodies is certainly such a notion." The conclusion thus reached by Lichtenberg is that the présenta tion of objects existing outside of us is due to a necessary form of our sensibility. Just as the idea of space itself, so is the presentation of objects existing in space a necessary condition of our sensibility. Now Maimon, in a similar vein, referred to the distinction which obtains between the Latin terms extra and praeter, both of which are rendered by the word ausser in German or outside in English. While extra extra denotes differentiation in space, praeter is more general, it implies differentiation as such, and can apply to a difference of con cepts. Concepts can be distinguished from one another by the different characteristic features making up their contents. But individual objects of the same kind and species, which possess the same characteristic features, can be distinguished from each other only by their external relations in space or in time. The "transcendental" meaning of the term "outside" implies differentiation in general; it can denote both the difference of spatial and temporal relations between objects and the difference of their content, i. e. the characteristic features of the con cepts. A triangle and a circle differ from each other by the content of their respective concepts; two congruent triangles can differ only by their existence in space, i. e. different spatial relations, or by the different points in time in which they arise in our consciousness, i. e. different temporal relations.10 While the term extra denotes spatial 10 Cf.

In employing the relational terms "outside of us" and "beyond us" the two connotations should be kept apart. There is, however, a fundamental difference between Maimon and Lichtenberg in the conception of the "thing in itself" resulting from the analysis of the term extra nos in its relation to praeter nos. Lichtenberg tries to explain, how praeter nos, which means merely the acknowledgment of some reality different from us as the cause of our inner modifications, is being transformed into extra nos, implying the assumption of the existence of objects outside of us in spaçe. It is due to a necessary form of our sensibility that we locate the causes of our sensations and the modifications of our inner self in objects existing beyond us in space. Just as space itself, which is always thought of as infinite, (for any finite and limited space is always thought of as part and parcel of the infinite space), is a necessary form of sensibility, so the presentation of that which causes the modifications of our inner selves as objects existing beyond us in space is due necessarily to the form of our capacity for sensibility. Since the leap from praeter nos to extra nos is due to a necessary form of sensibility, the idea of a "thing in itself" is grounded in the form of sensibility. Lichtenberg thus discovered a new form of the sensuous capacity in addition to the Kantian forms of sensibility, namely, time and space. The systematic place of the idea of a thing in itself is thus the Aesthetics, the subject matter of which is the capacity of sen sibility and its forms; and not the Analytics which deals with the forms of understanding. Thus, for Lichtenberg, the "thing in itself" is a necessary and indispensable concept, just as are the other forms of sensibility, time and space. Now according to Maimon's conception of a "thing in itself," it is not the result of a necessary form of sensibility; it is but a fiction of the imagination. The task of philosophy is to demonstrate the in congruity of such a concept. The leap from praeter nos to extra nos is not a necessary and indispensable act resulting from the very nature of the capacity of sensibility, it is rather an illegitimate act of the imagination which should be overcome by the light of reason and should be discarded altogether. The task of philosophical reason is to give a clear account of the concepts with which our mind operates and thus to bring about the recognition of and the distinction between necessary concepts and superfluous concepts, between logically con sistent and inconsistent notions and between real and imaginary ideas. And the task of the philosophy of language is to reveal the "tran scendental" meaning of the terms which acquire in their application to concrete objects a distinct and different connotation, depending</page><page sequence="16">268 SAMUEL ATLAS [16] on the nature of the objects. Maimon thus reduced the term "outside" to its transcendental meaning, namely, that it merely implies some thing beyond the limits of a certain entity, the form and character of the limits being determined by the nature of the entity involved. In relation to the material objects given to perception by the senses, the term "outside" in common language, i. e. on the level of a pre philosophic conception of reality, implies spatial relations between objects existing in space. In relation to non-material objects conceived by the mind, the term "outside" refers to the ideational limits of a concept. Now since, according to critical philosophy, the cognition of the phenomena of experience is impossible without the assumption of some forms and concepts of thought as necessary conditions of cognition, those elements of consciousness in reference to an object, which are not ordered by the categories and the concepts of thought, are beyond the limits of phenomena ; they are to be designated noumena. Furthermore, there is a fundamental difference between Lichten berg and Maimon in their conception of the relation obtaining between the phenomena and the noumena. According to Lichtenberg, the idea of a thing in itself is grounded in the search for a sufficient reason, a cause, for the rise of inner modifications of our consciousness. Thus, the principle of causality, in addition to a form of sensibility, con stitutes a determining factor generating the idea of a thing in itself. This is not the case with Maimon, according to whom there can be no causal relation between the phenomena and the noumena. Since causality in itself is a constitutive principle for the realm of phenomena, the principle of causality could not be applied to the noumena, and the thing in itself could not be thought of as causing the inner modifica tions of our consciousness. We see thus that the distinction between praeter nos and extra nos has led Maimon to totally different conclusions from those of Lichten berg concerning the concept of a thing in itself." " Cf. Friedrich Kuntze, "Salomon Maimons theoretische Philosophie und ihr Ort in einem System des Kritizismus," Logos, Band III, 1912. p. 293 f. Kuntze quotes from Drobisch, Kants Dinge an sich und sein Erfahrungsbegriff, Hamburg und Leipzig, 1885, p. 3, who refers to Lichtenberg's differentiation between extra nos and praeter nos as implying the distinction between metaphysical transcendent entities existing in themselves, independent of the subjective forms of comprehension, and objects of experience which are appearances in time and space. The latter are, as phenomena, in the sense of Transcendental Philosophy, outside of us. The distinction between the different meanings of "outside of us" to which we referred, as following from Maimon's conception of the thing in itself, is on an entirely different level. Extra nos and praeter nos both may refer to noumena. The former implies a metaphysical, transcendent thing, while the latter implies the</page><page sequence="17">[17] SOLOMON MAIMON'S PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE 269 The connection between Maimon's philosophy of language and his epistemological and metaphysical doctrines is here apparent. Maimon was the first among the contemporaries of Kant to grant a positive meaning to the concept of the "thing in itself," interpreting it in a purely immanent sense, thus making it compatible with the spirit of Critical Philosophy. The incongruity of a "thing in itself" as a transcendent reality in an idealistic system of thought, which considers the basis of our cognition of reality to be the forms of sensibility and of thought immanent to consciousness, was recognized by many contemporaries of Maimon. Jacobi and Aenesidemus-Schulze raised their incisive criticism against this dogmatic residuum in the Kantian system. Their recognition of the dogmatic nature of this concept served them as a means of attack against the very foundations of the critical philosophy as a whole by pointing out its inner in consistencies. The negative attitude to the "Critique" in its entirety, resulting from their recognition of the incompatibility of the concept of a transcendent thing with the spirit of the Critique, led them on paths away from Critical Philosophy altogether. Jacobi embraced a philosophy of feeling or belief, and Aenesidemus-Schulze adopted skepticism, a philosophy which must necessarily follow, according to his view, from the very fundamental assumptions of Kant himself. It was Maimon's merit to grant to this crux philosophiae, the thing in itself, an interpretation in a purely immanent sense. He has shown the compatibility of this concept, even its necessity, in a critical, idealistic system of thought which does not recognize a tran scendent object "given" to consciousness from without. By pointing out the constructive role of the concept of a thing in itself in a system of critical idealism, he defended the "Critique" against attacks fatal to its very foundations. The constructive and positive role of the concept of a thing in itself consists in the awareness of the unra tionalized and uncategorized elements immanent to consciousness. This recognition sets a problem for, and a task upon, the human mind for further investigation and for striving after the enlargement and expansion of the area of rationalization, thus promoting the growth and development of rational thought. This was possible for Maimon to accomplish on the basis of a philosophy of language, according to which the term "outside" is understood in a "tran scendental" sense. This term is generally taken in a literal and physical consciousness of the irrational components of an object, which are outside the area of rational consciousness. The difference between Lichtenberg's and Maimon's conception of the distinction between the two terms has not been noted by Kuntze.</page><page sequence="18">270 SAMUEL ATLAS [18] sense, as referring to spatial relations. Therefore, by noumena, as being "outside" and "beyond" the phenomena, was generally understood a transcendent reality underlying the phenomena and affecting them. But the term in its ideal and "transcendental" meaning should be understood in an immanent manner, namely, outside of categorized consciousness. Hence the "thing in itself" means those elements of our consciousness which are not rationalized and categorized, i. e. which are outside the domain of rational thought as determined by the concepts of the understanding. The noumena do not affect the phenom ena,ena, and the relation between the "thing in itself" and the appearances is not that of cause and effect. It comprises rather, in my opinion, those uncategorized elements of consciousness which constitute a problem for human thought; in the struggle with which problem the creativity of the human mind, striving for unity, order, and ra tionalization, is set into motion. The "thing in itself" does not affect phenomena',phenomena', rather it provokes the creative initiative of the human mind. The phenomena resulting from the spontaneous activity of the mind are entirely due to the forms of thought and to the mind's creativity. Not in vain has Maimon considered the philosophy of language the heart and soul of philosophy. In the light of the relation obtaining between Maimon's conception of the "thing in itself" and his doctrine of the figurative expressions as being grounded in the "transcendental" meaning of the terms — something genuine and original with the human mind — we understand the import and significance of Maimon's remark that "Philosophy in its proper understanding is nothing but a general doctrine of language."12 Maimon's philosophy of language is closely bound up with his idealistic conception of what constitutes the essence of cognition. It is grounded in an idealistic epistemology which consists in the recognition that knowledge cannot be completely derived from sense data and that the assumption of general forms of thought is in dispensable for a conscious account of cognition as an ordering process, cognition being not something passive but something active. Further more, these general forms of thought are a priori, that is to say, they constitute the fundamental pattern of the human mind ; without such forms of thought, experience as known to us, would be impossible. The human mind bears, as it were, the imprint of infinite reason, infinite reason intuitively and spontaneously creating and producing the objects of thought; nothing can be given to it from without. It " Cf. Tr. p. 269.</page><page sequence="19">[19] SOLOMON MAIMON'S PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE 271 recognizes objects not by means of sense perceptions but by an act of cognition. In like manner, the human mind cognizes the objects of experience by cognizing the creative and spontaneous general forms of thought. Accordingly, it is necessary to understand the essence of language, which is the outward manifestation of thought, as comprising expres sions and terms with a "transcendental" meaning corresponding to the various a priori forms of thought. Hence the tropes in language (i. e. terms signifying material, sensuous objects, as well as immaterial, ideational objects) should not be considered as figures of speech, i. e. as improper and inadequate terms, when they are used in relation to immaterial objects, but as manifestations of the general forms of thought. The terms are just as proper, adequate and appropriate with reference to immaterial and ideational objects as they are with reference to material and sensuous objects. The terms must be analyzed in order to reveal their "transcendental" meaning which can be related to a categorical form of thought; the "transcendental" meaning of the term is the same in its relation to material objects and to immaterial objects. According to a sensualistic conception of the essence of knowledge, the sensuous perceptions are the sole basis of all cognition ; all knowl edge of the objects of experience is reducible to sense-data. A philos ophy of language grounded on a sensualistic conception of cognition would consider the linguistic terms with reference to material and sensuous objects as genuine and primary expressions; but when the same terms are employed to signify immaterial and ideational objects they are derivative and secondary. The former are proper, adequate, and real; the latter are improper, inadequate, and unreal. The very meaning of the concept "figure of speech" implies the inadequacy and the unreality of terms with reference to immaterial and non sensuous objects. But Maimon, as an idealist in epistemology, considers the latter just as proper and genuine as the former. The tropes in relation to ideal, non-sensuous objects are expressions as adequate and as primary as they are in relation to material and sensuous objects. In both cases the terms are grounded in an a priori form of thought and reducible to its "transcendental" meaning. IV It is generally assumed that there is an essential difference, an unbridgeable gap, between the knowledge of the common man and philosophical knowledge. This is thought to be the result of the</page><page sequence="20">272 SAMUEL ATLAS [20] incapacity of the common human mind to grasp the abstract and super-sensuous concepts with which philosophy operates. But what may be the cause of the misunderstandings among philosophers themselves? These are due to a great extent, according to Maimon, to the ambiguities and the inexactness of our language. The terms with which philosophy operates are frequently not well defined; one and the same term may have different connotations corresponding, in each particular case, to the object to which it refers. Maimon devoted an essay, "Die philosophische Sprachverwirrung,"13 to an analysis of language as a medium of communication and presentation of phil osophical ideas. He shows there the causes of some confusions in philosophical thought as they result from confusions of language. It is wrong to assume, according to Maimon, that the common under standing of man is incapable of a high degree of abstraction and generalization. Our languages which have developed as a medium of thought and communication contain abstract concepts of a high order. Languages are rich in expressions conveying general concepts; there is an abundance of "transcendental" terms, i. e. expressions which refer to sensuous and to super-sensuous objects. The expressions thing thing or something, for instance, which occur so frequently in ordinary language, refer to objects, the determination of which is not yet recognized, though they are thought to be cognizable. This amply illustrates that common human understanding is capable of attaining concepts general and abstract to a high degree. "The difference between common human knowledge and the higher form of cognition, which can be designated as philosophical, does not consist in that the latter is more capable of constructing general and abstract concepts than the former, but merely in that the latter is capable of deriving the general characteristics common to various objects in a clear and distinct manner, while the former perceives the general concepts in a somewhat confused and indistinct manner."14 Thus the distinction between philosophical knowledge and common knowledge is not a distinction of essence but one of degree. This idea is grounded, it seems to me, in the general distinction obtaining between understanding and sensibility, according to Leibnitz and Wolff, namely, that the former is clear and distinct, while the latter is confused and indistinct. While, according to Kant, the difference between understanding and sensibility is one of essence, as they are 13 Philosophisches Journal, herausgegeben von J. G. Fichte und F. I. Niet hammer, 7. Band, 1797, pp. 213-258. 14 Ibid.., p. 215.</page><page sequence="21">[21] SOLOMON MAIMON'S PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE 273 grounded in two essentially different capacities, with Leibnitz it is a mere gradual difference of distinction and clearness. Maimon is here consistent in following Leibnitz, as he has applied Leibnitz's doctrine to the solution of the problem quid juris, i. e. the question concerning the possibility of applying concepts of understanding to objects of experience. Since sensibility and understanding are, according to Kant, essentially different capacities, the question quid juris is most pressing. Likewise, the difference between common language and phil osophical language is a mere gradual difference. Just as understanding and sensibility are not two essentially different capacities, so the difference between common language and philosophical language is a mere difference in the degree of clearness and distinctness. Hence, in the language of the common man, Maimon discovers general concepts which have their origin in pure thought, i. e. a priori. The task of philosophy is to unravel the inner meaning of expressions and terms of common language and to bring to clear consciousness what may be hidden from the consciousness of the common man. By this process of disentanglement, it can be shown that the common mind bears the mark of its relation to an infinite mind which is wholly spontaneous and a priori. The problem concerning the genuine meaning of the linguistic terms and expressions referring to sensuous and material things and to ideas and transcendent objects, is of paramount significance for the understanding of cognition. Whether the sensuous meaning of terms is primary and genuine, while their ideational meaning is derivative and secondary, or the latter is just as original and genuine as the former, is not merely a question concerning the historical development of language. Its importance is of a much wider scope. The solution of this question has a bearing on the epistemological conception of cognition, its role and its scope, and on the possibility and the limitations of the knowledge of reality. Whether we accept a materialistic or an idealistic view of the world will depend on the solution of this linguistic question. Should it be conclusively proved that the sensuous meaning of terms is their original and primary meaning, it would follow that the abstract and ideational concepts are, in an epistemological sense, not genuine. And idealism, as I understand it, with its emphasis on the creative character of cognition — in other words, the view that, in essence, cognition consists of concepts and ideas which are not derivable from the senses — would be endangered. According to Maimon, the conception that the greater part of linguistic terms and expressions are improper names, that is to say, that they</page><page sequence="22">274 SAMUEL ATLAS [22] are derived from proper and original terms which are all grounded in sense perceptions, is not only incorrect but, what is more important, "is contrary to the interests of reason and of true morality which is incompatible with sensualism. Such a view favors materialism; it lets Satan triumph over the good spirit, it places Ahriman above Ormazd."I4aThat is to say: by extending the reach of the percepts and contracting that of the concepts, materialism enlarges the sphere of the senses and narrows that of reason. In certain schools of Neo-Kantianism, orienting themselves ac cording to the highest forms of human cognition, mathematics and physics, the a priori concepts are derived from scientific thought. The impression may be gained that an unbridgeable gap exists between common knowledge and scientific cognition. Some critics have raised the objection that such a philosophy is a philosophy of science, not of the world, nor of man; science being only one aspect of human endeavor. But with reference to Maimon, whose philosophy is tied up with scientific thought, more so than that of most philosophers of the post-Kantain period, such a criticism is out of place, for he explicitly tries to show that a priori concepts are to be found in language which is the medium of cognition and of communication for the common man. In the general concepts transcending perception and in the "transcendental" concepts, referring both to sensuous and to non-sensuous objects, can be detected the nature of the human mind as creative and spontaneous, and these are to be found in common knowledge as manifested in common language. The difference between common knowledge and scientific knowledge consists solely in the degree of clearness and distinctness. It is therefore method ologically proper to orient philosophical investigation, for the deduction of the general concepts, on scientific knowledge which is characterized by a greater clarity and systematic unity of thought. However, general concepts are also present in common knowledge. Hence the analysis of the linguistic terms having a "transcendental" meaning will lead to the discovery of the general concepts which are genuine to the human mind as such. The difference between common knowledge and philosophical cognition, based on scientific knowledge, concerns merely the modal quality of the concepts, that is, the intensity of their clearness. There is, however, a much graver deficiency in common knowledge which may have a detrimental effect on philosophical cognition, since the latter has been developed from the former. This consists in the fact 143 Tr. p. 302.</page><page sequence="23">[23] SOLOMON maimon's philosophy of language 275 that common knowledge abounds in general terms, while it is deficient in terms designating the particular characteristics of things. There is in common knowledge an abundance of concepts referring to species, while it lacks terms referring to the individual features of objects. This can clearly be demonstrated by an analysis of language. The more ancient a language is, the more are there to be found in it terms designating the general characteristics of objects, and cor respondingly, the fewer are the terms for the designation of the particular features of objects. In Biblical Hebrew, for instance, the same term is used for the ordinary sense of seeing, for perception in general, and for cognition. The same applies to the term "hearing," which refers to the sensuous perception of hearing, to noticing and experiencing in general, and to understanding with the mind.15 The reason for this phenomenon in language lies in the fact that various functions of the mind have something in common, namely, the reaction of the subject to something given from without. But since the essential characteristics of each of these mental functions do not consist solely in what is common to them all, but rather in what is peculiar to each mental function, there must therefore be separate terms corresponding to each of them in particular. So, for instance, with regard to the term "hearing," if the actual sense percep tion be designated as A, the perception of a command should be designated by Ab, and the intellectual comprehension of an idea designated by Ac. Philosophic language suffers from the same deficiencies which characterize ordinary language; the inexactness of the latter is present also in the former. Philosophy employs general concepts without having a criterion of their "material" truth; that is to say, it does not demonstrate the objective reality of a general concept when it is applied to particular phenomena of experience. So, for instance, the general concept of causality is considered by critical philosophy a transcendental form of thought a priori, since it is a necessary condi tion of experience as such, for without it no experience would be possible at all. Thus we know only the formal reality of this concept. 16 Philosophisches Journal, ibid., p. 216. The different connotations of the term roeh (seeing) in the Hebrew Bible has been pointed out by Maimonides. Cf. Guide for the Perplexed, I chap. 4. Likewise with regard to the term shomea (hearing), cf. ibid. chap. 45 and 47. However, Maimon pursues here a different purpose. While Maimonides' aim is to remove all anthropomorphisms from the Hebrew Bible with reference to the concept of God, Maimon uses these examples as an illustration of the need for a revision of philosophical language.</page><page sequence="24">276 SAMUEL ATLAS [24] But the question still remains concerning the objective reality of this concept in relation to the particular phenomena to which it is applied, since the connection between the particular object A to the particular object B, as cause and effect, may be due to reasons psy etiological. Furthermore, philosophy employs terms in a loose manner without exactly defining their sense. The term "objective reality," for instance, which is a genuine philosophical term, as it is a product of philosophical thought, can mean different things, depending on the context in which it is used. The general meaning of the term, i. e. its genus, is quite clear. We attribute to a thing objective reality when the idea of the thing is determined not only by the form of thought but also by the object given to the subject through perception and intuition. That is to say, the thing given to the subject determines the application of the form of thought to it in such manner that the thing is com prehended as an object of reality. But the term "given" is ambiguous; it has different meanings corresponding to the object in relation to which it is used. Thus in Euclidean geometry the term "given" is employed in a different sense altogether. In the proposition "When A is given, B is also given," the antecedent (A) is arbitrarily presupposed, the consequent (B), however, follows necessarily from the supposition. A line is given when its two limiting points are determined.16 The term "given" in its general meaning, i. e. its genus, must therefore first be subdivided into its various kinds, and then there has to be determined in what sense the term is meant before applying it in a particular case. In Maimon's analysis of the various meanings of the term "given" we can, it seems to me, find a clue to Maimon's conception of the thing in itself. We have already referred to his doctrine of the thing in itself as a purely subjective immanent concept. The thing in itself is not an object existing outside of consciousness, "given" from with out to the subject. It is rather those elements of our consciousness with reference to an object, which are not categorized and brought under the dominion of the logical forms, that are to be designated the thing in itself. Those irrational elements, constituting a problem for, and imposing a task upon the human mind for the search of greater rationalization, make up the thing in itself. It is "given" not from without but from within consciousness. Assuming that the mind is affected in the reception of impressions, through the senses, from something outside of it, in the conception of the sense-data as a problem 16 Philosophisches Journal, p. 230.</page><page sequence="25">[25] SOLOMON maimon's philosophy of language 277 for cognition, a great deal of thought is implied. The formulation of the sense-data as irrational and the consciousness of such are the result of a process of thought; they are thus immanent to subjective con sciousness. Hence the thing in itself is given from within consciousness. This is true even on admission that the sense-data are affected by something outside the subject. The mere passive reception of sense data is subject matter of psychology. But the concept of a thing in itself, as something irrational, belongs to logic. As such, the concept of a thing in itself is derived from within consciousness. And it is thus closely bound up with the various meanings attached to the term "given." The term "given" can just as well mean given from within consciousness. In this way, we can see coherence and sys tematic unity between the various doctrines of Maimon. In a similar manner Maimon analyzes the expression "there is." This expression can imply different meanings. We say: there is an equilateral triangle. By its construction we can demonstrate its reality. In mathematics is also used the number y/2• But is there such a thing? With equal right the question can be answered affirmatively as well as negatively. There is such a thing as the square root of 2, since it can endlessly be approached through an infinite series. On the other hand, it can be said that there is no such a number as produces the number 2 by its own multiplication. The mathematicians take it for granted that there is such a number with the understanding, however, of the meaning of the term "there is" peculiar to it. It is different from the meaning of the same expression in the proposition: there is a number y/4•17 The expression "there is" has thus different implications. Hence, before discussing the question of the existence or non-existence of some object, it is necessary to define what sense is attached to the expression "there is" in the particular case under discussion. Many discussions in philosophy would thus lose their ground. The theist and the atheist, for instance, argue with one another about the exist ence of God. One maintains there is a God, and the other asserts there there is no God. It would be possible to terminate the discussion, if the meaning of "there is" in this particular case were clearly defined by considering the various possible implications of that expression. They should ask each other: "What do you mean by the expression: there there is a God? And what do you imply by saying: there is no God? Does it mean that there is a God as there is a house, a tree, or is it in a sense similar to that of the proposition: there is a triangle, there is a number y/2 ?"18 ' Ibid.., p. 231 f. 18 Ibid., p. 232.</page><page sequence="26">278 SAMUEL ATLAS [26] This shows clearly the inadequacy of our language for the présenta tion of philosophical ideas. If there were in our language special terms corresponding to the various meanings implied in the term "there is," many misunderstandings could have been avoided. For then, in each particular case, the special term suitable to it would have been employed instead of the general term which is ambiguous. "According to a proper understanding of the idea of God, it is just as inappropriate to say that there is a God, as it is improper to say that there is no God: the former implies too much, and the latter too little. In other words, both propositions are equally wrong";1' the reason being that the concept of existence implied in the expression "there is" cannot be a predicate of the subject God. It is analogous to the impossibility of predicating color with reference to a math ematical line. "It is improper to say of a mathematical line that it is black or that it is not black, for color is not a possible predicate of a mathematical object." With regard to mathematical objects the expression "there is" implies not existence but the possibility of construction. Since an equilateral triangle, for instance, is possible of construction, we say that there is such an object. Similarly, we say that there is no equilateral triangle which is rectangular. For, apart from the impossibility of its construction, it would contradict other mathematical objects, the reality of which has been verified by construction and its consequences. But, with regard to an idea, such as the idea of God, "it can neither properly be said that there is nor that there is not such a thing. For an idea as such can neither be represented in intuition (Anschauung), nor can it contradict other concepts which are possible of representation."20 This doctrine of Maimon that existence is not a possible predicate of the idea of God, and the comparison between the predicate of existence in relation to God with the predicate of color with reference to a mathematical object, constitute the basis of Maimon's "Principle of Determinability." This principle seeks to establish a law governing the synthetic propositions analogous to the law of identity and con tradiction which govern the analytic propositions. That is to say, by this law, it is possible to determine which of the predicates can and which of them cannot be predicated of a subject. This idea of Maimon that existence is not a possible predicate of the idea of God has its source in Maimonides. Maimonides has argued that the attribute of existence as applied to God should not be under stood in a positive sense but in a negative sense, i. e. as not non existence. Existence with regard to objects of experience implies a " Ibid., p. 233. 30 Ibid.</page><page sequence="27">[27] SOLOMON maimon's philosophy of language 279 quality added to essence. This involves a compound of essence and existence which is inapplicable to God, the idea of which must be thought of as absolute unity. Of God it can only be said that His essence is identical with His existence. This is a kind of existence entirely unknown to us, for it is totally different from the existence of objects experienced.21 The idea that existence cannot be attributed to God is common to Maimonides, to Kant and to Maimon, but it has been differently determined by each of them, corresponding to their respective philos ophies. According to Maimonides, it is the result of his conception of absolute unity which has its roots in Neo-Platonism and which has de termined his doctrine of divine attributes as being altogether negative. With Kant it follows from his conception of the process of cognition as an act of synthesis, the necessary conditions of which are the forms of sensibility, time and space, and the categories of understanding. Maimon, however, derived it from the general Principle of Determin ability, thus granting it a logical formulation which governs synthetic propositions as such. From Maimon's conception of the idea of God as an infinite goal which can only be endlessly approached, follows his criticism of atheism as a positive system of thought. Only with reference to an anthropomorphic system of theology is atheism possible. The belief in the existence of limited, national deities can be shown to involve a contradiction and to be therefore logically untenable. But the idea of an infinite, all-perfect being, which is the true belief of monotheism, is at least not contradictory. It is logically possible, since it does not involve a contradiction. A contradiction is involved in a concept in which the predicate of the proposition is either incompatible with its subject or with other concepts, the truth of which has been established. But the idea of an infinitely perfect being cannot be demonstrated to involve a contradiction.22 It is true that, with regard to objects of experience, the mere logical possibility of a concept is no guarantee of its reality. The example of a decahedron, to which Maimon refers time and again, is a case in point. A decahedron (a figure in space of ten equal sides) is logically possible, as it does not involve a contradic tion. Yet its construction is actually impossible. There must be some cause in the nature of space, unknown to us, which renders this logically possible concept impossible of realization. This demonstrates that the reality of a concept, i. e. the existence of an object of expe rience corresponding to the logical concept, cannot be deduced from " Maimonides, Guide for the Perplexed, I, 58. 22 Cf. S. Maimon, Philosophisches Wôrterbuch, Berlin, 1791, p. 25 f.</page><page sequence="28">280 SAMUEL ATLAS [28] its merely formal, logical possibility. For positing the reality of a concept, there is required, according to critical philosophy, in addition to its logical possibility (i. e. the absence of contradiction), some positive basis in the realm of experience. This is attained either by construction, as in the case of mathematical objects, or by some positive ground in the realm of experience. Though a logical concept as such may not involve a contradiction, its reality as an object of experience may be rendered impossible due to its incompatibility with some aspect of nature, known to us or unknown to us. But with reference to the idea of an infinite, most perfect being, transcending all experience, which by its very definition is neither an object of possible construction nor an object of perception, its reality does not require a positive basis in the realm of experience, nor can it be refuted on the ground of some experiential phenomenon. For no object of experience which is limited can demonstrate the unreality of an infinite idea. In other words, the idea of an infinite being cannot be refuted by demonstrating its incompatibility with experience. Hence, with reference to such an idea of God, atheism as a positive doctrine is untenable. The idea of an infinitely perfect being can, however, be considered problematical. It is like any mathematical concept which in itself does not involve a contradiction, the reality of which, however, is problematical so long as its construction has not been demonstrated. The logical possibility of a mathematical concept follows from the mere absence of a contradiction, but its actual reality in the realm of experience must be demonstrated by the construction of a corresponding mathematical object. Now, the conviction that the idea of an infinite being is problematic should by no means be considered atheism, since it does not imply the denial that the exist ence of such a being is possible. It involves merely the view that the idea of an infinite, all-perfect being is beyond the possibility of dem onstration as to its reality. But possibility and reality are forms of the modality of concepts, and since the idea of an infinite being cannot have a corresponding sensuous schema in the realm of expe rience, its reality can neither be affirmed nor denied. The idea of an infinite, most perfect being as an endless goal implies the recognition that our reason has its limitations. The human mind is powerless to demonstrate the objective reality of this concept, but it recognizes its subjective reality as an idea universally valid and necessary. This idea is not constitutive. Its value is regulative; it implies an ideal of infinite perfection towards which man has end lessly to strive and which man can continuously approach.23 נ־ Ibid., p. 27.</page><page sequence="29">[29] SOLOMON maimon's philosophy of language 281 The idea of God as an infinite idea, which can endlessly be ap preached but never fully attained, similar to the mathematical concept of infinity which can only be approached through infinite series (as the square root of 2), led Maimon to the evaluation of mathematics for the understanding of metaphysics. He follows here in the great tradition of the continental rationalists, Descartes, Leibnitz, and Spinoza. But he uses mathematics to illustrate the idea of God in accordance with the spirit of critical philosophy which has shown the untenability of dogmatic metaphysics. With regard to the relevance of mathematics for metaphysics, Maimon again follows Maimonides. Maimonides states that there is a necessary connection between the study of mathematics and natural science, on the one hand, and the attainment of a true metaphysical idea of the nature of God on the other, the former being indispensable for the latter. "Many propositions based on the nature of numbers and the properties of geometrical figures are useful for the under standing of those properties which must be negated in reference to God, and these negations will lead us to further conclusions."24 To this statement of Maimonides, Maimon remarks: "Excellent! the nature of irrational numbers, for instance, demonstrates that it is sometimes impossible to obtain a clear concept of a thing as an object in itself and yet we can determine its relation to other objects. Thus we have no concept of God as an object in itself and yet His relation to us, which is the very basis of ethics, could be determined. The algebraic formulas lead us often to the concept of the infinite as a limiting concept which has a regulative, though not a constitutive function."25 Maimon here emphasizes two ideas. First, the relation of math ematics to metaphysics is seen in a new light. In mathematics we learn to distinguish between the knowledge of a thing as an object in itself and the mere knowledge of its relation to other objects, as in the case of irrational numbers. And secondly, through mathematics, we are led to the understanding of the infinite as a limiting concept which has a regulative, not a constitutive function, which is some thing of vital importance for the understanding of metaphysics. Being critical of dogmatic metaphysics, including that of Maimonides, or of those of its doctrines which are grounded in Aristotelianism, Maimon could nonetheless methodologically approve of Maimonides' evaluation of mathematics as a basis for metaphysics and employ it for a conception of metaphysics in the spirit of critical philosophy. God should be conceived not as a first cause, but as a 24 See Guide, I, 34. 25 S. Maimons Lebensgeschichte, Berlin 1792, II, p. 43.</page><page sequence="30">282 SAMUEL ATLAS [30] final, endless goal. And the concept of infinity in mathematics could serve as a schema for presenting the idea of God as an infinite ideal which can be assymptotically approached but never fully attained. Maimon compared the process of cognition with the act of seeing. The comparison of knowledge with light and the process of knowing with that of seeing is of ancient date. Plato seems to have been the first to recognize the relation between the process of cognition and the act of seeing. The philological root of the central concept in Platonism, namely the doctrine of ideas, reveals a connection between knowing and seeing. The same is apparent in Plato's famous descrip tion of the common man as being in the state of a cave-dweller who sees only the shadows of things. The philosopher has liberated himself from the chains binding him to the cave, i. e. from the senses; he has seen the light, thus attaining a clear vision of the pure ideas which are the true essences of the things. Plato's comparison of knowledge with light and the act of cognition with that of seeing is grounded in his metaphysical conception that the essence of being consists of transcendent entities. The "many" given to our senses are the shadows of the true metaphysical entities, the ideas. Cognition is not rooted in an act of synthesis establishing unity but in an act of intuiting the true essences of the things, which are unities. For Maimon, however, whose thought is rooted in critical philos ophy, the essence of truth consists in an act of synthesis; thus the act of cognition cannot be a process that comprehends something which exists in itself. The comparison between knowledge and light cannot therefore have for Maimon the same import and meaning that it had for Plato. Apart from the historical antecedents and consequences of the comparison between light and knowledge, we have first and foremost to recognize the particular manner in which Maimon considered the similarity between the cognitive process and the art of seeing. He quotes the Psalmist: "With Thee (God) is the fountain of life; in Thy light do we see light" (36:10). He explains: the word "light" can be taken in its proper sense as referring to the sensation of sight and also in its figurative sense of conceiving with the mind. In both cases the same relation obtains between light in itself and the objects illumined by it. We see directly by light nothing but the light itself ; indirectly, however, we see the objects by the light which, shining upon them,</page><page sequence="31">[31] SOLOMON MAIMON'S PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE 283 is reflected in our eyes. In its metaphorical sense, as the light of knowl edge, the same relation obtains between the cognitive capacity and the cognized objects. Through the light of the mind we cognize directly the cognitive capacity and its forms, and indirectly, through the forms of thought, we cognize the objects to which the forms of thought apply. Our understanding conceives in the objects nothing but what it puts into them out of its own resources.26 Now the source of Maimon's comparison of the process of cognition with the act of seeing is in Maimonides, who devoted a chapter in his Guide (1.4) to an analysis of the various biblical terms which refer to seeing with the eye and which have also the metaphorical meaning of seeing with the mind. Likewise, in Maimonides is the reference to the Psalmist's "in Thy light do we see light." Twice Maimonides mentions this passage to illustrate this idea of the relation between the human mind and the divine, infinite mind. In II.12, he deals with the influence, i. e. the emanation, of the infinite mind upon human reason, and sums up his definition of this emanation: "The concluding words of the verse 'In Thy light do we see light,' express precisely the same doctrine that, by the influence of the mind which emanates from God, we become wise and are guided toward the comprehension of the divine intellect, i. e. the Active Intellect." In II.52, Maimonides deals with the same idea of the relation of the finite, human mind, and the infinite mind as regards the idea of individual providence. According to his doctrine, individual providence is nothing but an attainment of man resulting from the activation of the mind to the extent of its becoming a part of the divine, active intellect. "We attain an idea of God by the very light emanating from God upon us, as the Psalmist says: 'In Thy light do we see light!' " The suggestion, that Spinoza's saying, "The light illumines itself and also the darkness" is the possible source of Maimon's parallel between light and cognition,27 should not make us fail to recognize the tremendous difference of the motives underlying this parallel in the two systems of thought, that of Spinoza and that of Maimon. Spinoza's saying is closely bound up with his metaphysical doctrine of res cogitans as an attribute of substance. The two attributes, mind and extension, as two aspects of one and the same substance (God), are compatible with one another. The modi of extension, i. e. the objects of reality, are comprehended and penetrated by the mind 26 Philosophisches Journal, 7th vol. p. 236 ff. 2' Cf. Friedrich Kuntze, Die Philosophie Salomon Maimons, Heidelberg, 1912, p. 382.</page><page sequence="32">284 SAMUEL ATLAS [32] because the order prevailing in the one realm (mind) fully corresponds to the order prevailing in the other (extension): ordo et connexio idearumidearum idem est ac ordo et connexio rerum. Hence the light of the mind illumines itself and the darkness, i. e. extension, because of the immanent harmony between the two attributes. Maimon, however, employs the parallel of light and cognition in the Kantian critical sense, namely, that cognition is essentially an act of synthesis and that the objects cognized are the result of a process of categorization by the forms of thought. Through the ap plication of the forms of thought to objects of perception, the objects are categorized and conceived as unified entities or, in the words of Maimon, "Our understanding conceives in the objects nothing but what it puts into them out of its own resources."28 Hence the forms of thought in themselves, just as light, can directly be recognized, while through them, indirectly, the objects of reality are recognized, just as the objects illumined by light are seen through the medium of light. Now the parallel between light and reason, in the manner for mulated by Maimon, holds true only on the basis of his particular conception of the a priori forms of thought. But it is incompatible with a strictly critical conception of the a priori forms. Maimon assumes that the forms of thought can be directly cognized. Just as light is directly seen in and through itself, so are the forms of thought directly apprehended in themselves. This, it seems to me, is not compatible with a strictly critical conception of the idea of a priori and is contrary to the transcendental method. According to this method, the forms of thought are to be derived from the objects cognized, i. e. from the objects of experience as comprehended and formulated by the natural sciences. But the forms of thought cannot be cognized in and by themselves separate from, and independent of, the objects of experience. Maimon was critical of Kant's conception of a priori. Kant held that mathematical judgments are synthetic a priori propositions since they are grounded in the a priori forms of intuition, time and space. Maimon's position is that, since the construction of the geometrical objects is necessary for the derivation of these mathematical proposi tions, these propositions cannot be considered a priori in a pure and absolute sense. Only such propositions as are conceived prior to the construction of any object are a priori in a pure and absolute sense. 28 Philosophisches Journal, ibid.</page><page sequence="33">[33] SOLOMON maimon's philosophy of language 285 This is the case with the laws of logic. They are binding for all objects of thought, independent of their content; for no object can be thought of in defiance of the laws of identity and of contradiction. No predicate can be attributed to a subject unless the two do not contradict one another. The laws of logic, which are entirely independent of the objects of experience and prior to them, can be conceived in and by themselves; they are a priori in a pure and absolute sense. With reference to such concepts, the comparison of the process of cognition with that of light, as formulated by Maimon, holds true. Just as light is first perceived in itself and then, through its medium, objects can be seen, so the a priori concepts which are prior to, and independent of the objects, are first cognized by themselves and then, through the medium of the forms, the objects are cognized. Thus Maimon's analysis of the comparison between light and cognition is grounded in his conception of the idea of a priori which is different from that of Kant. According to the latter, the a priori concepts are derived from the objects of experience as their necessary conditions. The very essence of the transcendental method, as formulated by Kant in his Transcendental Deduction of the Categories, hinges upon the principle of the possibility of experience. That is to say that since, without the categories of thought, no experience whatsoever would be possible, these concepts are necessary conditions of the objects of experience. Accordingly, the concepts of thought cannot be conceived in and by themselves independent of and prior to the objects; they are rather derived from the objects of experience as their necessary and indispensable conditions. Hence, the comparison of cognition with light in Maimon's formulation is not compatible with the Kantian conception of a priori The comparison of the act of cognition with that of "seeing" may be interpreted to involve the realistic conception of cognition, as consisting essentially in th.e comprehension of reality as it is in itself. The corollary of such a view of cognition is the correspondence theory of truth which defines truth as consisting of the correspondence attained between thought and reality. Supposing that the human mind is capable of perceiving the objects of reality as they are in themselves, the idea of the creative activity of the thinking process must be discarded as a distortion of the true function of thought. Such a conception of the essence of cognition appeals to common sense, but it is not compatible with the transcendental critical doctrine of cognition with its emphasis on the creative character of cognition and of truth. As a matter of fact, in our own time, various philosophical</page><page sequence="34">286 SAMUEL ATLAS [34] schools have attempted to defend this realistic common sense concep tion regarding the function of cognition and the essence of truth. E. G. Moore is a representative exponent of this realistic common sense philosophy, and especially various thinkers of the phenom enological school influenced by E. Husserl, have put forth a new and vigorous attempt to reformulate the realistic conception of cogni tion and truth. It is of interest to note (in connection with the task before us), that the doctrine of Wesenschau, i. e. seeing or intuiting of essences, as developed by Husserl, which plays such a central role in modern phenomenology, has employed the act of "seeing" as a characterization of the cognitive act. It is no mere accident that the phenomenology of Husserl and the existential philosophy of Heideg ger, which was developed on the basis of the former, employ terms pertaining to sight and to the act of seeing for the description and characterization of the cognitive process, its capacities and its function. Terms such as "to look," "to see," "to be seen," "to show," "to be shown" and many similar visual images and epithets, are frequently used by Heidegger; they all have the same connotation of grasping an object by the act of cognition in a manner similar to perception by an act of vision. Likewise, terms and expressions taken from the realm of acoustics, such as "to listen," "to hear" are used by him for the characterization of the cognitive act by which the objects of reality in their essence are grasped by the mind. These linguistic terms are to be taken not merely as figures of speech or as symbolic expressions, but as indicating the realistic conception of cognition and of truth. In these turns of speech, the idea is implied that the essential features of the objects of reality are com prehended by the human mind. The essence of being as it is in itself is accessible to the human mind. Heidegger explicitly states that his preference for the visual terms for the characterization of the cognitive process is intended to indicate the similarity obtaining between the visual act of perceiving by the eye and the cognitive act of com prehending by the mind. Objects of reality which are accessible to cognition are grasped by the mind in their true essence as they are in themselves. Through the process of cognition, the subject encounters being in its essence, inasmuch as it affords an approach by intellectual comprehension.2' This characterization of our mental operations embraces also the cognitive process as manifested in natural sciences; it determines the nature and essence of the physical laws as established by natural " Martin Heidegger, Sein und Zeit, Halle a. d. S. 1935, p. 147.</page><page sequence="35">[35] SOLOMON maimon's philosophy of language 287 science. In the natural laws as discovered by science are revealed the inner connections and the interrelations between the phenomena of nature as they are in themselves. According to this epistemology, there is no cleavage between phenomena and noumena; the former are the manifestations of the latter. The problem of the "thing in itself" with its inherent contradic tion, (positing, as it does, a knowledge of something which is beyond the limits of the forms of cognition) is central to Critical Philosophy, but non-existent in a system of thought according to which the human mind is capable of comprehending reality as it is in itself. The discovery of natural laws consists, according to this system, in uncovering and laying open to view connections and interrelations between the objects of reality as they exist in themselves. Through the discovery of the physical laws by Newton, for instance, being in itself and in its true essence was disclosed.30 The pure metric science of space, such as geometry and trigonometry, arose through the discovery of the very essence of space as it is in itself.31 Similarly the epistemology of Nicolai Hartmann which is grounded in modern phenomenology regards cognition as the process of com prehending reality in its essence. Hence the relation of the subject to the object is characterized not as a creative relationship but as a receptive relationship.32 Cognition of an object means the attainment of a correspondence between the object as it is and its mental image;33 wherefore Hartmann also employs turns of speech which appertain to the perception of sense data, such as seeing, for the description of the cognitive act. We have brought these examples from contemporary philosophy for the sole purpose of illustrating the implication of a realistic concep tion of the essence of cognition and truth in the visual expressions employed for the characterization of the cognitive act. This implica tion is contrary to the trend of Maimon's thought grounded as it is in the critical philosophy. A whole world of difference separates Maimon's conception of cognition and truth from that of Heidegger and Hartmann. Hence his figurative representation of cognition by the image of seeing cannot possibly have any relation to the realistic view of epistemology, according to which the objects of reality, as they are in themselves, are revealed to, and discovered by the subject. 30 Ibid., p. 9. 31 Ibid., p. 112. 32 Nicolai Hartmann, Metaphysik der Erkenntnis, pp. 38, 138, 198. 33 Ibid., p. 44.</page><page sequence="36">288 SAMUEL ATLAS [36] The realistic conception of the role and function of cognition, as consisting in the comprehension of being and reality in itself, is diametrically opposed to the idealistic critical doctrine of cognition as a creative process transforming the inchoate formless "given" in accordance with its own laws and principles. While the realistic epistemology with its emphasis on the passive, receptive role of cognition, is oriented toward "common-sense," i. e. toward the non scientific or pre-scientific conception of knowledge, the idealistic doctrine of cognition is oriented toward scientific knowledge, and especially toward the physical sciences grounded in the deductive processes of mathematics. The metaphor of "seeing" for the act of cognition, as used by Maimon, cannot have the implication that the human mind possesses the capacity of perceiving the object as it is in itself. Maimon was one of the most vocal critics of the concept of the thing in itself, as it was generally understood by the contemporaries of Kant, i. e. as a noumenon affecting phenomena. Such a concept is self-contradictory in a critical, idealistic system of thought, the central doctrine of which is that all knowledge is determined by the forms of intuition and the concepts of understanding. Knowledge is thus possible only within the limits of experience, and the positing of an object beyond the confines of the forms of intuition and the concepts of understanding is an incongruous and gratuitous idea in a critical system of thought; such a concept is a residuum of the dogmatic philosophy which considers causality as such a thing in itself. In critical philosophy, the concept of causality is bound up with the schema of time, which is a form of intuition, and therefore the thing in itself, a noumenon beyond time, cannot be the cause of the phenomena which are in time. Con sequently, the idea of a thing in itself must either be understood as a fiction of the imagination, or as an ideal goal, namely, the solution of all problems concerning an object of experience, fully rationalized and categorized. Or the thing in itself can be identified with those elements of our consciousness, concerning an object, which are not ordered in a definite synthesis; in other words, with conditions the cause of which is unknown to the mind. All these various conceptions and formulations of the idea of a thing in itself are to be found in Maimon.</page></plain_text>
