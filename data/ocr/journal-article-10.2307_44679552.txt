INTRODUCTION In 2012, three conservation organizations brought suit in Sonoma County Superior Court in California against the State Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.1 The lawsuit challenged a controversial proposal by a corporation to clear-cut 154 acres of redwood forest in order to plant pinot noir wine grapes in Sonoma County. The three environmental protection organizations who were plaintiffs - Friends of the Gualala River, Sierra Club, and Center for Biological Diversity - argued that the state agency being sued had failed, contrary to state law, to consider adequately the environmental impacts of converting forested areas to open a vineyard when it approved the project.2 This lawsuit is typical of many, if not most, judicial challenges to government action that seem to adversely affect the natural environment. In such lawsuits three elements are commonly present: (1) the suit is brought by a non-profit non-governmental organization 1 Ctr. for Biological Diversity, Lawsuit Filed to Stop Clearcutting of Redwoods for Sonoma County Vineyard (Jun. 10, 2012), available at http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/20 1 2/sonoma-vineyard-06-07-20 1 2.html. 2 Miguel Llanos, Redwoods v.

These injuries to nature or natural objects have reached the United States Supreme Court where human actions (1) destroy or remove ecosystems or unique environmental places,8 (2) contribute to climate change and global warming,9 (3) poison, degrade, or pollute environmental goods, like waterways,10 (4) threaten the extinction of endangered species," and (5) kill or harm animals.12 Although the human plaintiffs in these lawsuits are aware of and upset by the proposed or ongoing harm to nature and natural objects, 3 Friends of the Gualala River is a nonprofit group that advocates for preservation of the Gualala River watershed; the Sierra Club works to protect and restore wild places; the Center for Biological Diversity seeks to protect endangered species and wild places.

Instead, any "injury" to a human is at most psychological. Nor, in these kinds of lawsuits, are humans necessarily within the "zone of interests" sought to be protected by the statute or regulation whose violation is the substantive basis for the lawsuit.13 Rather, the environmental law that is the underlying cause of action for the litigation most often has as its purpose the protection of an ecocentric environmental asset, not an anthropocentric interest.14 Despite a plethora of laws designed to protect natural systems and objects, and despite the fact that the "injury" in cases implicating these laws is to nature and not humans, no private lawsuit based on these laws may proceed, either in federal court, or to enforce a federal statute, if the plaintiff cannot demonstrate that the plaintiff has been injured. The plaintiff-injury requirement stems from the Constitution's demand that disputes in federal court constitute a "case" or "controversy," over which Article III grants jurisdiction.15 The United States Supreme Court 13 One of the early modem standing cases, Associations of Data Processing Service Organization v. Camp , 397 U.S. 150. (1970), distinguished the question of whether a party had a "legal interest" as separate from the standing inquiry in this context, which requires: (1) a case or controversy (i.e., a showing by the plaintiff that the challenged action has caused him injury), and (2) determining whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is "arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question." 14 For example, the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531-1544 (1973) ("ESA"), the source of much environmental litigation, has as its primary ecocentric purpose to provide a means "whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved [and] to provide a program for the conservation of such . . . species." Id. § 1531(b). Although the ESA contains a citizen suit provision, under which "any person" may sue to enforce its substantive protections, id. § 1 540(g)( 1 ), the statute is not in any way intended to prevent or avoid harms to humans that may result from an injury to or loss of a threatened or endangered species. 15 Lujan , supra note 1 1, at 560-61. The California lawsuit filed against the State Department of Forestry seeking to block the clear-cutting of redwood trees is a state law action filed in state court, where Article III standing requirements are influential but not binding. However, while federal decisions on the issue of standing are not binding on state courts, most states look to federal standing jurisprudence for guidance, where state standing doctrine parallels the Article III standing test.

Thus, there is a fundamental anomaly in Article III judge-made standing doctrine, which is being reflected throughout the lower federal courts whenever they face lawsuits alleging harms to nature or living things.20 When human decisions adversely affect environmental resources or natural objects, the only plaintiff able to enter federal 2410390, *8 (Ohio Ct.

Taitano, No. CVA06-013, 2006 WL 3060030, *3-4 (Guam Oct. 27, 2006). 16 The doctrine of standing has evolved from Braxton County Court v. West Virginia , 208 U.S. 192, 197 (1968), requiring that a plaintiff be personally affected by the challenged conduct to have standing. 17 Baker v. Carr, 369 U.

In addition to "injury to the plaintiff," the other parts of the three-part Article III standing test are: there must be a causal link between the plaintiffs injury and the defendant's wrongdoing; and it must be likely that the plaintiffs injury can be redressed by a favorable judgment. Lujan , 504 U.S. at 560-61 . This article will focus on the "injury to the plaintiff' part of the standing test. 20 See, e.g. y Pac. Rivers Council v.

What are the practical, constitutional, and ethical implications? And what should be done with the standing doctrine to connect the plaintiff to the true injury? This article addresses each of these issues. Part II recounts the history of the Article III standing doctrine, and the emergence of the critical "injury-in-fact" test, which has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court to require a unique and particularized injury to the typically anthropocentric desires of the plaintiff, even if the underlying claim involves an injury to a broad- based ecocentric environmental interest.22 The history of "environmental standing" in the Supreme Court, beginning in the early 1970s, reveals that the plaintiffs injuries are always the threshold standing condition examined by the Court, not the injuries to nature and natural objects that the plaintiff is trying to prevent or redress. Although the presence or absence of anthropocentric or plaintiff- specific injuries has been determinative in deciding whether standing exists in these cases, Part II will point out that the real interest protected by the substantive law implicated in the litigation is inevitably a purely environmental or ecocentric interest.23 This insistence on "injury to the plaintiff'24 for standing purposes, when the injury being litigated is to nature or natural objects, has created a troublesome "Double Paradox," discussed in Part III. The first of these, the "Injury Paradox," is examined in Part III A. This paradox 21 Compare Pacific Rivers Council v. United States Forest Service, 668 F.3d 609 (9th Cir. 2012), where standing was conferred when one plaintiff would have been deprived of "great personal solace in the knowledge that Sierra Nevada native species . . . persist" had clear-cutting occurred, and Friends of the River v. Army Corps of Engineers, 870 F. Supp. 2d 966, 982 (E.D. Cal. 2012), where standing was conferred to plaintiffs challenging government action prohibiting all vegetation except grass on levees, where such action allegedly adversely affected birds and fish there, because plaintiffs "enjoy . . . many of the species," with American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. Feld Entertainment, 659 F.3d 13 (D.C. Cir. 2011), where standing was denied when the plaintiff had not demonstrated sufficient emotional attachment to the alleged mistreated elephant. 22 Lujan , 504 U.S. at 560. See also Hope M. Babcock, The Problem with Particularized Injury: The Disjuncture Between Broad-Based Environmental Harm and Standing Jurisprudence , 25 J. Land Use and Envtl. L. 1 (2009). 23 See, e.g. y Summers , 555 U.S. at 494-5 (The plaintiffs injury was disappointment in not being able to "enjoy" national forests that had been logged. However, the plaintiffs substantive argument was that the Forest Service regulations applied to a particular sale of timber had violated a statutory requirement that the agency consider the larger "environmental impact" of the sale). 24 Laidlawy 528 U.S. at 181.</page><page sequence="7">2013] Standing and Environmental Harm 6 1 arises when there is a disconnect between the injury required for Article III standing, and the injury to the natural resource or natural object protected by the environmental law. The resulting inconsistency between the injury needed for Article III, and the injury contemplated by the underlying environmental law, means that the federal courts have had to manufacture, for standing purposes, a condition to legal relief that is nowhere contemplated by the law-making body providing legal protection to the environmental interest being harmed.25 Indeed, the injury-to-plaintiff condition is often contrary to the goal of federal environmental statutes containing citizen suit provisions encouraging litigation when purely ecocentric interests are threatened.26 Apart from separation of powers concerns, the Injury Paradox can result in courts marginalizing real harms to nature and natural objects, while elevating the psychological anxieties and sadness of the humans bringing suit under environmental statutes. The Injury Paradox may also mean that threatened and harmed purely environmental interests have no redress, despite being legally protected, when the plaintiffs non-environmental injury is deemed inadequate for standing purposes.27 Because the Injury Paradox requires courts to focus as a threshold matter on the plaintiffs harm, which is often psychological, the standing inquiry demands a very subjective plaintiff-specific inquiry, while ignoring the interest that is really being harmed - the environment and environmental resources. Part III B takes up the second paradox that flows from the injury-in- fact requirement - the "Plaintiff Paradox." Whereas the Injury Paradox prevents enforcement of statutory violations whose effects are experienced solely by nature and objects in nature, the Plaintiff Paradox 25 See David S. Cassuto, The Law of Words: Standing, Environment, and Other Contested Terms , 28 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. 79, 86-87 (2004); W. Earl Webster, How Can Mother Nature Get to Court? The Status of the Standing Doctrine in a Post Laidlaw Landscape , 27 J. Land Resources &amp; Envtl. L. 453, 460 (2007). 26 See Preston Carter, "If an Endangered Tree Falls in the Forest, and No One is Around....: " Resolving the Divergence Between Standing Requirements and Congressional Intent in Environmental Legislation , 84 Notre Dame L. Rev. 2191, 2202, 2204-05 (2009) (commenting on the "disconnect" between the purposes of the Endangered Species Act, containing a citizen's suit provision, and the injury-in-fact requirement to establish Article His standing); Cassuto, supra note 25, at 86 (commenting on the "disjuncture" between the purposes of the citizen's suit provision of the Clean Water Act and the Supreme Court's requirement that prospective plaintiffs allege a cognizable injury-in-fact to the plaintiff). 27 See Babcock, supra note 22, at 2-3; Webster, supra note 25, at 465; Jeanne A. Compitello, Organizational Standing in Environmental Litigation , 6 Touro L. Rev. 295, 315 (1990). One form of redress, if a private party is denied standing, is for the federal or state government to commence an enforcement action protecting the natural resource. When there is such a public action, substantive environmental protection statutes may ban citizen suits. See, e.g., Sierra Club v. ICG E., LLC, 833 F. Supp. 2d 571 (N.D.W.Va. 201 1).</page><page sequence="8">62 Virginia Environmental Law Journal [Vol. 3 1 :55 forces parties seeking to litigate purely environmental harms to present their claims in a self-interested manner contrary to the purposes of the Article III standing doctrine. The fundamental purpose of standing turns on whether the plaintiff has demonstrated the presence of a true "case or controversy." To do so, the plaintiff must allege such a personal stake in the outcome as to ensure that "the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution."28 However, when courts consider whether plaintiffs seeking to protect environmental interests have satisfied the injury-in-fact test, the focus is on the plaintiffs self-interested harm, which is usually psychological. The focus is not on whether that plaintiff really has a "personal stake in the outcome," or whether that plaintiff has the professional experience and economic grounding to present the "dispute ... in an adversary context and in a form . . . capable of judicial resolution." Part III B will show how the Plaintiff Paradox results in disingenuous claims, which some commentators have called nothing more than "artfully drawn pleadings,"29 where the "injury" suffered for standing purposes by the successful plaintiff is often no more than some kind of emotional fear, disappointment, or frustration. This bad feeling might be because the plaintiff (who is often just one person) would like to picnic near a river, but is "concerned" that a waterway is, or might be, polluted by the defendant.30 Or a negative emotion might arise when a plaintiff is saddened by the prospect of decreased opportunities to engage in bird watching due to a ban on leg traps, which in turn might lead to an increase in bird prédation.31 Although these completely anthropocentric psychological "injuries" have been deemed sufficient to meet the injury-in-fact test, they have no (or at best only a tenuous) nexus to the harm suffered by the environmental interest protected by the law raised by the plaintiff. Nor does being sad in any way suggest, or help predict that, the plaintiff has the necessary Article III standing requirements of (1) a personal stake in the outcome, or (2) the ability to mount a lawsuit in a form viewed capable of judicial resolution. In other words, in the context of federal litigation involving harms to nature or natural objects, the Court's injury-in-fact standing requirement satisfies neither the purposes of the environmental law that is the cause- 2« Flast v. Cohen, 392 .S. 83, 101 (1968); See also Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 735 (1972); Baker v.

Part IV looks into the origins of the Double Paradox. The source of the Injury Paradox is the Court's assumption, repeated in most of the modern environmental standing cases, that law suits may not be filed by plaintiffs (especially human plaintiffs) on behalf of threatened or harmed natural resources or natural objects; rather, standing demands that "the party seeking review be himself among the injured."32 Or, as the Court succinctly stated in Defenders of Wildlife v. Laidlaw ,33 "[t]he relevant showing for purposes of Article III standing ... is not injury to the environment but injury to the plaintiff."34 Part IV will show that this assumption is not compelled by Article III. Moreover, in environmental lawsuits, a logical incoherency results when there is a separation between a harm to the plaintiff, litigated separately as a threshold matter under Article III, and harm to the environment, litigated on the statutory merits.35 Part IV then discusses twin reasons for the Plaintiff Paradox: (1) The Supreme Court's refusal to grant standing to organizations perfectly capable of representing and advocating for the purely environmental interest protected by law; and (2) the Court's illogical requirement that standing may only be granted to individual members of the organization who must demonstrate an anthropocentric harm in order to correct an environmental harm.36 Two consequences follow from this rule requiring that an individual group member of an association satisfy the injury-in-fact condition. First, the Injury Paradox is encouraged. The organization may not satisfy standing by showing that it is willing and able to enforce the law that will prevent the environmental interest from being harmed; instead, a human "member" of the organization must " Lujan, 504 U.S. at 563; Sierra Club, 504 U.S. at 734. 33 528 U.S. at 181. 34 Id.

Second, the Plaintiff Paradox is perpetuated. Well-ftinded professional organizations dedicated to protecting natural resources and objects have the requisite Article III "personal stake" in the outcome, and ability to frame the "dispute ... in an adversary context capable of judicial resolution."37 Yet, these organizations cannot meet the threshold for standing while the courts search for individual plaintiffs who are sufficiently concerned or unhappy about, for example, a possible redwood logging operation. Part V argues that the standing doctrine should be reformed in the case of harm to nature and natural objects, where the real victim of the harm is not a human or some other artificial entity, but a purely environmental interest. In such cases, carefully vetted non- governmental organizations ("NGOs") should be able to bring lawsuits to protect the environmental interest. Standing may be granted if the NGO has a non-frivolous sufficient interest in the environmental interest at stake, as well as the professional, experiential, and economic ability to seek redress in court to prevent the environmental injury. For years, commentators, appellate judges, and even Supreme Court justices have suggested organizations should be able to litigate statutorily protected injuries to nature if the organizations possess the commitment, expertise, and resources to do so.38 This exception to the injury-to-the- plaintiff standing requirement has already been successfully adopted in many countries outside the United States.39 Part V explains how these specialized organizations are preferable to other proffered solutions to the Double Paradox,40 satisfy the Article III requirement that the plaintiff have a true "personal stake" in the outcome of the case, and are better able to ensure the legitimacy and vitality of the adversarial process. 37 Compitello, supra note 27, at 308-15. 38 See, e.g., Sierra Club, 504 U.S. at 757 (Blackmun, J., dissenting); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 579-80 (Kennedy, J., concurring); Farm Sanctuary, Inc. v.

INJURIES TO NATURE AND THE SUPREME COURT'S STANDING REQUIREMENTS Beginning in the early 1970s, two parallel trends began to converge to bring about the Double Paradox. The first of these was an increasing awareness and concern about human-caused harms to nature and natural objects. What was special about these particular harms was that while they were responsible for adversely affecting a natural resource or system, they did not have an immediate direct impact on humans. In other words, the injury was largely ecocentric, not anthropocentric. The second development took place in the United States Supreme Court. From 1970 through the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Court's standing rules evolved. In a series of cases involving purely environmental injuries, the Court set forth the constitutional rules that would apply to plaintiffs in federal court seeking to assert the statutory protections afforded to natural resources and environmental goods. These standing rules created a disconnect between the plaintiffs anthropocentric injury required for standing and the ecocentric injury protected by the law. They also produced a disturbing inconsistency between the purposes of Article III standing and the types of plaintiffs that were both denied and granted standing. III. STANDING JURISPRUDENCE BEFORE THE ERA OF BROAD-BASED ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS The core of the Supreme Court's standing doctrine is that the party bringing the action, the plaintiff, must be able to demonstrate that that particular plaintiff has suffered an injury-in-fact. The other two components of the Court's standing requirements that (1) the injury must be traceable to the defendant, and (2) the injury must be redressable by a favorable decision - stem from the threshold requirement that the plaintiff show an injury-to-the-plaintiff.41 The need for a plaintiff to be injured is not an explicit demand in the Constitution. Rather, the Court has inferred that Article Ill's "cases and controversies" limitation42 will best be satisfied if plaintiffs in the federal system have a "personal stake" in a controversy.43 The Court's thinking about the injury-to-plaintiff requirement seems logical: If the plaintiff is, in fact, injured by the defendant, then not only is the plaintiff 41 Lujan , 504 U.S. at 560. See also WildEarth Guardians v. Salazar, 859 F. Supp. 2d 83, 94 (D.D.C. 2012) (denying standing where plaintiffs claimed injury because of concerns about climate change stemming from coal mining because plaintiffs failed to show "that their alleged injuries are likely to be redressed by a favorable decision in this case."). 42 U.S. Const, art.

Camp .46 Later, in Sierra Club v. Morton,*1 the Court found that harms to the plaintiffs aesthetic and environmental well-being were an adequate injury to confer standing.48 Then, in the seminal 1990 case of Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation ,49 the Court established that the "irreducible minimum of standing" begins with the requirement that "the plaintiff must have suffered an "injury in fact" which is "concrete and particularized."50 By "particularized," the Court explained that "the injury must affect the plaintiff [but not the natural resource] in a personal and individualized way."51 This injury-in-fact-to-the-plaintiff test makes sense when the plaintiffs unique interests have been harmed by the defendant. The test is also consistent with the purposes of Article III (i.e., requiring plaintiffs to have a "personal stake" assuring "concrete adverseness") when the plaintiffs particularized interest in an environmental good or natural resource is adversely affected by the defendant. For example, it is appropriate as a threshold standing condition for the plaintiff to be injured when the case involves a government defendant that reduces the plaintiffs water rights,52 causes lost revenues by restricting snowmobile access restrictions,53 or threatens an organic seed business.54 These are harms to specific economic and property interests of the plaintiff.

It also makes sense that a plaintiff must show particularized injury when the plaintiff is genuinely angry or concerned about a government action threatening harm to the plaintiffs health (e.g., from water pollution),55 or to the plaintiffs recreational interests (e.g., a plaintiffs desire to kayak peacefully without being assaulted by motorized jet skis).56 In these cases, the plaintiff is indeed the party whose "particularized" health interests or environmental desires are allegedly being impacted by the defendant. In these cases the plaintiff is injured, or is about to be injured. That plaintiff is likely to have a true personal stake in the outcome of the litigation, helping to ensure that the controversy will be presented to the court in a traditional adversarial setting. But when the relevant injury is not to a human plaintiff, or to a plaintiff that is a government entity concerned about its own proprietary interests (e.g., a state or local government),57 the Court's injury-to-the- plaintiff requirement becomes problematic. When the injury is not to the plaintiff, but is instead to "someone else,"58 or in the case of harms to nature and natural objects, to something else, there is little logic in a standing requirement that focuses only on the injury to the plaintiff. In these cases, insisting on an injury to the plaintiff both ignores the real injury, which is not to the plaintiff, while requiring the plaintiff to manufacture an injury in order to bring suit in court. a. WHEN THE INJURY IS TO SOMETHING ELSE: THE RISE OF BROAD-BASED ECOCENTRIC ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS While the Supreme Court was developing and fine-tuning its injury- to-the-plaintiff test for standing, environmental advocates began to experience a growing sense of unease. For those concerned about overall environmental quality and the welfare of living organisms, it seemed that there was an increase in purely ecocentric harms to natural systems and natural objects. In particular, five classes of human- induced harm to nature and living things came to dominate (and still dominate) the environmental and judicial landscape. While humans may be collaterally affected by these harms, the real injury is to a non- anthropocentric natural resource. 55 See Lewis v. FMC Corp., 786 F.

The world's 9.9 billion acres of forest are under siege, both by logging and climate change.60 Wetlands and marshlands, which serve a vital ecological role, are disappearing due to agriculture, logging, dredge and fill actions, mining, and other commercial and industrial activity.61 The world's coral reefs are in decline,62 and natural rangelands and grasslands are expected to follow due to climate change.63 Even the oceans are being jeopardized by humans, putting at risk marine ecosystems and ocean services that moderate both climate and greenhouse gases.64 2.

Indeed, it has been estimated that if all the species listed as threatened were lost in the twenty-first century, and that rate continued, we would be on track to lose three-quarters of all species within a few centuries.66 Some scientists have even warned that the planet is in the midst of a "Sixth Mass Extinction," similar to the last one, around 65 million years ago, that wiped out the dinosaurs.67 Extinctions signal loss of biodiversity, while species diversity contributes to the effective functioning of the earth's ecosystems.68 3. Climate Change and Global Warming Human activities have added billions of tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the Earth's atmosphere. This contamination of the air has caused global temperatures to rise.69 Many scientists agree that warmer temperatures in turn have altered or have the potential to alter climates all over the planet, producing more extreme weather, changes in precipitation, and rising sea levels.70 Scientists concede that there is no way to determine whether a single event, such as a hurricane or a localized drought, has been triggered by climate change. Nonetheless, most climate scientists have generally concluded that (1) the climate throughout the planet has been altered,71 (2) this change has produced unprecedented heat waves, upward trends in sea levels, and unusual downpours,72 and (3) human-caused greenhouse gases have driven this change.73 66 Richard Pearson, Are We in the Midst of a Sixth Mass Extinction?

Environmental Pollution Although ecosystem damage, extinctions, and climate change make up most of the headlines involving ecocentric harms, historic human- created pollution of environmental goods - air, water, and land - remains endemic. Air pollution was one of the first areas of environmental concern to be recognized as a commons problem. At first, a number of state and local governments sought to curb it before the national government (and the Environmental Protection Agency) weighed in with clean air rules encompassing the entire country.74 Despite much regulation in place, the goal of air quality remains elusive, in America and elsewhere.75 Pollution of waterways similarly seems stubbornly common, especially for so-called non-point sources like agriculture and logging.76 Human contamination of surface soil and underground waters continues as well.77 5.

ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS, THE SUPREME COURT'S STANDING JURISPRUDENCE, AND THE ORIGINS OF THE DOUBLE PARADOX During the same time period when non-anthropocentric harms to nature and natural objects were becoming more pronounced and publicized, the Supreme Court was developing and fine-tuning its standing rules for entry into Article III courts. Perhaps not coincidentally, these rules arose in litigation that implicated each of the five classes of ecocentric harm outlined in Part II B. In a series of cases dealing with human-caused harms to natural resources and living organisms, the Court first announced and then rigidly adhered to, the injury-to-the-plaintiff test. It also refused to grant standing to well- funded, serious, and effective environmental advocacy groups with a true "personal stake in the outcome." Instead, environmental advocacy organizations had to offer up at least one member of the group who could allege some anthropocentric, usually psychological, "injury" resulting from the defendant's action. By strictly requiring that there be an injured human plaintiff when litigating a case dealing with anthropogenic harm to nature, the Court created the Double Paradox. 78 Two such organizations are The Humane Society of the United States and The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Morton, 82 a well-respected and established environmental organization sought to enjoin the Walt Disney Corporation from developing a ski resort in a section (the Mineral King Valley) of the unique ecosystem of Sequoia National Forest. The Sierra Club alleged an ecocentric harm: the development "would destroy . . . the natural and historic objects and wildlife" of that area.83 While acknowledging that such allegations could, in theory, comprise legal injury, the Court denied standing because the Sierra Club had not claimed that any of its members would otherwise be affected by the development.84 The Court also set out an expansive definition of anthropocentric injury that would suffice for standing purposes - injury could be to a person's "aesthetic, conservational, and recreational" values.85 In dissent, Justice Douglas advocated granting standing to nature - the Mineral King Valley itself.86 Justices Blackmun and Brennan proposed that a knowledgeable and competent organization, like the Sierra Club, should be given proxy standing when purely environmental harms are alleged.87 Sierra Club in effect creates the Injury Paradox in holding that when there is a legal injury to the environment, those harms to nature are not the relevant injury for standing purposes. Instead, standing requires specific injury to the plaintiff. That injury could consist of someone being unhappy, aesthetically, about a development in the Mineral King Valley. The Plaintiff Paradox emerges as well. Although the Sierra Club majority reiterated that standing to sue depends on "[wjhether a party has a sufficient stake in . . . the outcome of the controversy ... as to ensure that the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context,"88 and although the Sierra Club likely met that condition, the majority refused to grant the Sierra Club standing. It repudiated the notion that there could be an organizational interest in the environmental problem, and required environmental advocacy organizations to find at least one of its members who could allege some anthropomorphic injury. 82 405 U.S. 727 (1972). 82 Id. at 734. 84 Id. at 734-41. 82 Id. at 738. 86 Id. at 742. 82 Id. at 755-56. 88 Id. at 731-32.</page><page sequence="19">20 1 3 ] Standing and Environmental Harm 7 3 Summers v. Earth Island Institute 89 again involved an alleged harm to the same unique ecosystem that was the subject of the Sierra Club case - a proposed salvage sale of timber within the Sequoia National Forest. Like the Sierra Club majority, the Summers majority repeated that the doctrine of standing requires federal courts to satisfy themselves that "the plaintiff has alleged ... a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy."90 Although the Earth Island Institute certainly had such a "stake in the outcome," it did not have the constitutional ability as an organization to litigate its case. Instead, the organization had to find one of its members and assert that "[that plaintiff] is under threat of suffering 'injury in fact' that is concrete and particularized . . . ."91 Like the Court in Sierra Club, the Summers majority opinion reaffirmed that "generalized harm to the forest or the environment will not alone support standing."92 Unlike Sierra Club, the environmental organization in Summers did offer up as a plaintiff an organization member who alleged that he had visited many national forests, and had planned to visit unnamed national forests in the future. The proposed sale of timber would allegedly impede his ability to aesthetically and recreationally "enjoy" national forests. The Summers majority denied standing because the plaintiff had failed to allege that the particular timber sale contemplated by the defendant would adversely affect "a specific and concrete plan of [the plaintiff]" that would bring him to the exact parcel of that forest about to be logged.93 The upshot of the Court's ruling on standing is that a federal court could not address the merits of whether the federal defendant had acted unlawfully in authorizing the timber sale, thereby creating harm to an ecosystem. The organization - the Earth Island Institute - was likely fully prepared to litigate that legal issue. But, for standing purposes, harm to the ecosystem was irrelevant. What was needed for standing was harm to an organization member (e.g., disappointment) that would ensue when the plaintiff came across that particular logged area of forest. 2.

The majority found that there was no standing because the designated organization members who would be allegedly hurt by the absence of the animals lacked a specific plan to return to the location where the animals lived. Thus, without that plan there was no certainty that the members' injury (unhappiness at not seeing the animals) would occur.100 Since the Defenders of Wildlife did not have standing because it was an organization, and since the members listed in the organization's complaint had not alleged a sufficiently concrete anthropocentric injury, the purely ecocentric threat of extinction to endangered animals would, for now, not be litigated. Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion in Lujan is notable because of his suggested solution to the Plaintiff Paradox. Kennedy concurs that the critical question for standing is whether the plaintiff has "an actual, as opposed to professed, stake in the outcome."101 He further stated that there might be circumstances where a party might have such a personal stake when there was a sufficient "nexus" to the real environmental injury-in-fact (e.g., a nexus to a threatened ecosystem).'"02 In Justice 95 Id. at 557-58.

EPAm is unique because it is a harm-to-the- environment case where the plaintiff is neither an organization, nor a government prosecutor, but is a sovereign government - a State. In Massachusetts, the ecocentric harm was (and still is) to the planet - human-caused climate change leading to global warming and a host of harms to nature and natural objects.105 Consistent with the Injury Paradox, these harms were not sufficient for standing purposes. What was required was a showing of an injury-to-the-plaintiff, the State of Massachusetts. In this case, the plaintiff was able to demonstrate an acceptable plaintiff-specific injury for standing by alleging that some fraction of the plaintiffs (the State's) coastal property could be lost due to global warming and flooding events. That Massachusetts was able to allege this sufficiently particularized injury to the plaintiff points out two fundamental problems stemming from the Injury Paradox. First, there remains a disconnect between the real injury (climate change) experienced by the real party-in-interest (the Earth), and the injury alleged for standing purposes by a party who is, at most, only collaterally injured - rising seas marginally affecting a state's coastline. This disconnect is exacerbated by the fact that the alleged statutory violation of the federal Clean Air Act ("CAA") is connected not to the plaintiffs injury - the State's shoreline, but to the Earth's injury - unregulated greenhouse gases causing climate change. Second, the need to find a plaintiff with particularized injuries leads to an exercise by plaintiffs lawyers to find, or manufacture, someone (or, in the case of Massachusetts, some entity) with a personalized connection to the real harm. This artifice leads to what Chief Justice Roberts in Massachusetts referred to as a "lawyers game,'"06 and to im Id. at 580. i»4 549 U.S. 497 (2007). 105 Id. at 521 (e.g., global retreat of glaciers, reduction in snow-cover extent, accelerated rate of the rise of sea levels, irreversible changes to natural ecosystems). 106 id. at 526 n.24.</page><page sequence="22">76 Virginia Environmental Law Journal [Vol. 3 1 :55 what commentators have called perfecting the practice of "artfully drawn pleadings."107 4. Environmental Pollution: Laidlaw The case of Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc. 108 is a textbook case demonstrating the problems associated with the Double Paradox. The named plaintiff was a well-respected environmental organization concerned about a commercial wastewater treatment plant that had been discharging numerous pollutants, especially mercury, into the North Tyger River. These discharges allegedly exceeded the plant's permit limits set pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act ("CWA").109 The CWA also contained a citizen suit provision, providing a private right of action for its enforcement.110 Although the true injury was an ecocentric one to the North Tyger River, which was being polluted with mercury, for standing purposes the plaintiff had to produce human beings (i.e., members of the organization) who claimed that they had an anthropomorphic injury. In this case, that injury was an emotional one - they no longer enjoyed the North Tyger River because of their "fears" and "concerns" about the river's pollution.111 The Laidlaw majority granted standing to these plaintiffs, because it was convinced that these fears might cause them to feel so negatively about the river that they might not "bird watch" or "picnic" there, and certainly not canoe on it.112 In effect, the majority was holding that even though there might be a catastrophic toxic poisoning of an environmental resource, a river, and even though the Congress had passed a statute, the Clean Water Act, intended to prevent exactly these kinds of ecocentric harms, the citizen suit provision of this law could not be activated for standing purposes without a citizen demonstrating that the plant's pollution of the river would deter him or her from picnicking there. To underscore this incongruity, the Laidlaw majority reiterated that, "[t]he relevant showing for purposes of Article III standing ... is not injury to the environment but injury to the plaintiff."113 107 Compitello, supra note 27, at 297, 310; Babcock, supra note 22, at 10.

The Injury Paradox is present because the Clean Water Act requires injury to a natural resource for there to be a violation, while the Court requires harm/injury to some human being. The Act's goal is to protect waterways, and its citizen suit provision allows for a private right of action where pollutants are discharged into protected waterways. An additional judge-made requirement demanding an emotional injury to some human plaintiff is not consistent with this statutory framework.114 Moreover, to hold that an injury to a human (e.g., fear that there might be a reduction in bird watching) determines justifiability under a statute whose goal is environmental protection is to marginalize both the concerns of the environment and the intent of Congress.115 Article III simply does not require that the alleged fears and concerns of a citizen living near an endangered resource be elevated above the very real environmental harm that might be occurring to that resource. This marginalization of natural resources seems especially acute when Congress has explicitly stated that it owes a legal duty to the resource, not the citizen. Laidlaw also shows how the Court's standing rule creates the Plaintiff Paradox. The majority finds that certain organization members who are "fearful" and "concerned" have standing. The named plaintiff - The Friends of the Earth - did not have standing as an organization; its standing was completely dependent on a few of its members who for this litigation alleged sufficient negative emotions. As noted previously, Article III standing seeks to find plaintiffs with a real "personal stake in the outcome," and who are capable of advocating the case in a way "which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends . . . .""6 Members who may have some concern about having a picnic near the river likely do not have that "personal stake in the outcome," and they most certainly are not going to be the ones who litigate the case in a way "which sharpens the presentation of issues." But the organization has that personal stake, and its lawyers have the ability to sharpen the issues by bringing suit. Under the Court's standing requirements, instead of searching for a plaintiff with the personal stake, capability, and willingness to pursue judicial enforcement of a statutory violation, the critical standing question instead concentrates on whether an affidavit in the complaint lists someone whose emotional anguish, despondency, or nervousness is deemed sufficient to meet the injury-to-plaintiff test. The relevant 1 14 See Sunstein, supra note 45, at 209-23. 115 Cassuto, supra note 25, at 93. 1 16 See supra notes 43-44 and accompanying text.</page><page sequence="24">78 Virginia Environmental Law Journal [Vol. 3 1 :55 Standing inquiry should instead be an objective one, where a court determines if the plaintiff has the ability to mount a truly effective lawsuit. The current standing inquiry, by contrast, is purely subjective, where a court seeks to determine the genuineness and extent of the emotional injuries being alleged."7 5. Harm to Animals: Japan Whaling Association In Japan Whaling Association v. American Cetacean Society, 118 the Supreme Court acknowledged that environmental organizations had standing to challenge the federal government's refusal to issue economic sanctions against Japan for Japan's refusal to comply with an international treaty's mandate to cease whaling. Consistent with Sierra Club, what was critical to the Court was not harm to the interests of these organizations in protecting the whales, or harm to the whales being slaughtered by the Japanese. Rather, what was determinative for standing purposes was that certain "members" of these organizations would be sufficiently aggrieved because the killing of whales might adversely affect their "whale watching" activities."9 Japan Whaling is another example of the Injury Paradox: Even though the international treaty allegedly violated by the Japanese was intended to protect an animal, the standing test focused on psychological injury to certain members of an environmental organization, not injury to the animal. The Plaintiff Paradox was present as well: Although the American Cetacean Society had the necessary stake in the outcome to ensure that a case involving a treaty violation could be competently litigated, the organization's legitimacy as an animal advocacy group was irrelevant. The Court's only standing inquiry was whether the whale watching of certain members of the organization might be adversely affected by observing whales being harpooned. IV. INJURIES TO NATURE AND THE DOUBLE PARADOX REFLECTED IN THE LOWER COURTS The Court's modern environmental standing jurisprudence requires lower federal courts to find an individual, particularized injury to a specified, usually human, plaintiff.120 This inquiry ignores the real injury or threatened harm to some natural object, which is the harm the 117 Cassuto, supra note 25, at 93-94. 118 478 U.S. 221 (1986). 119 Id. at 230-31 n.4. 120 LaidlaWy 528 U.S. at 181 ("The relevant showing for purposes of Article HI standing ... is not injury to the environment but injury to the plaintiff.").</page><page sequence="25">2013] Standing and Environmental Harm 79 underlying statute seeks to prevent.121 The environmental plaintiff need only allege a plaintiff-specific, typically anthropocentric injury, rather than a violation of the law that was intended to prevent the actual harm to the environment or other protected natural object.122 This requirement creates the Injury Paradox, a fundamental disconnect between the statutorily protected injury - Congress' protective goal - and the Court's human-injury standing requirement.123 The Injury Paradox produces another disconnect: Organizations with the dedication, purpose, and resources to pursue litigation to redress injuries suffered by statutorily protected natural objects are themselves unable to achieve standing. Such plaintiff-organizations instead search high and low for a member of the organization who is capable of asserting a cognizable injury, often requiring a disingenuous claim of emotional and psychological injury. The resulting Plaintiff Paradox legitimates as appropriate Article III plaintiffs, individuals who themselves lack a "concrete stake in the outcome of the litigation.'"24 Both paradoxes arise in lower courts as they attempt to apply Supreme Court standing doctrine to cases involving the same recurring five ecocentric harms discussed in Part II B. a. THE INJURY PARADOX IN LOWER COURTS In the context of environmental and animal protective legislation, the injury-to-plaintiff condition required by the Court is contrary to the statutory goal.125 In passing these statutes, Congress sought not to protect humans, but the air, water, species, and land where "the earth and its community of life [remain] untrammeled by man.'"26 Many of these statutes contain citizen suit provisions, where Congress explicitly allows citizens to bring suit in Article III courts by alleging statutory violations which themselves result in an inherent "harm" to the protected environment or animal at issue.127 However, because the Court's current standing doctrine requires a cognizable injury to a plaintiff, the human plaintiffs who bring these citizen suits are generally 121 See, e.g., Carter, supra note 26, at 2202-04. 122 Cassuto, supra note 25, at 79. 123 Id. at 79-80, 98.

Destruction and Degradation of Ecosystems Where violation of an environmental statute is sufficient to cause the destruction of an entire ecosystem, but does not cause a sufficiently particularized, incidental human-injury to an identifiable member of the plaintiff-organization, the organization will not have standing to litigate the ecosystem injury.129 The Court's particularized plaintiff-injury requirement for standing is particularly ill-suited for addressing injuries to ecosystems, because the very nature of these unique environments is fundamentally inapposite to a particularized-injury inquiry: ecosystems are "physically complex and constantly changing," resulting in "broad- based" injuries that cannot be "neatly unraveled.'"30 2. Species Extinctions A standing requirement demanding some human injury in environmental litigation is contrary to congressional intent in instances where harmful effects are felt solely by the environment, without any incidental injury to third parties.131 In the Ninth Circuit, plaintiffs filed suit alleging violations of several federal-protective statutes resulting in harm to cetaceans, a protected species. 132 No humans were, or could have been, harmed. The defendant's actions were carried out in such a 128 Carter, supra note 26, at 2191-93.

It may be possible for a plaintiff to successfully establish standing in lawsuits instituted to protect an endangered species, by showing sufficient anguish at the prospect of a species becoming extinct as a result of government action.135 It seems to stretch credulity, however, to presume that the fatal demise of certain species, such as an endangered beetle, could spur some genuine emotional connection between it and the human-plaintiff, such that the plaintiff can be said to have standing to protect its existence.136 3. Climate Change and Global Warming Plaintiffs seeking to raise violations of environmental statutes causing harm to the climate often fail on the grounds that the alleged injuries are "generalized" and "too speculative."137 Injuries to the Id. at 1171. 134 The Cetacean Community court did recognize that the environment, natural resources, or animals could be permitted by Congress to bring suit in their own right, like other non-human plaintiffs such as corporations. The court concluded that nothing in the text of Article 111 explicitly limits standing to human plaintiffs. 386 F.3d. at 1175-76. Nonetheless, the court ultimately held that the statutes at issue prevented standing by the environmental resource itself, because, under the citizen suit provision allowing "any person" to bring suit, such a person had to be a human. Id. at 1 177-78. See also Palila v. Haw. Dep't of Land and Natural Res., 852 F.2d 1106 (9th Cir. 1988) (Ninth Circuit acknowledged that standing could be in a natural object itself). 135 See , e.g. y Pac. Rivers Council v.

Supp. 2d 1220 (D. Colo. 2011) (holding that the individual member of an organization did not have standing because he did not live in the immediate vicinity of the endangered beetle species' habitat, nor did the plaintiff assert sufficiently specific and concrete plans to return to the area at the time when the beetle might no longer be there, causing the plaintiff to feel sad at the prospect of not seeing the beetle). 137 See, e.g.. Amigos Bravos v. United States Bureau of Land Mgmt., 816 F. Supp. 2d 1118 (D. N.M. 2011) (plaintiffs failed to show that alleged climate change-related injuries were "actual" or "imminent" because the climate changes were not anticipated to occur for many years or decades); Sierra Club v.

Jul. 29, 2011) (plaintiffs allegations failed to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement since the</page><page sequence="28">82 Virginia Environmental Law Journal [Vol. 3 1 :55 climate are particularly difficult to litigate because it is almost impossible to prove that some specific and identifiable violation of a statute contributing to climate change can be connected to a particularized negative effect on individual human-plaintiffs. When the injury is to the weather, or global temperature, a standing mie requiring injury to some plaintiff will result in the focus shifting to an attenuated human harm or imperceptible government harm. The real injury-in-fact is to a natural system, not a litigator. 4. Environmental Pollution In litigation involving pollution of an environmental good, plaintiffs asserting standing often face the ironic task of having to avoid any allegation that the violation of an environmental statute has resulted in actual harm to the environment. Since Laidlaw, lower courts adhere to the notion that harm to or pollution of the natural object or environmental good is not the appropriate inquiry. Rather, "a plaintiff is not required to show environmental harm to establish an injury in fact," but may satisfy the injury requirement simply by "asserting a reasonable fear and concern about the effects of the [defendant's actions] on [plaintiffs] use and enjoyment of [the environment].'"38 Such reasoning exemplifies precisely the type of irrational thinking that underscores the Injury Paradox. If a plaintiff fails to allege a sufficiently personalized injury brought about by the environmental pollution, the pollution itself continues, as does the harm to the environmental good.139 complaint alleged that greenhouse gas emissions caused or purportedly would cause only environmental impacts). 138 Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., 629 F.3d 387, 395 (4th Cir. 201 1) ("[T]he plaintiffs [are] not required to present evidence of actual harm to the environment so long as a direct nexus existed between the plaintiffs and the 'area of impairment.'"). 139 See also, e.g., ); National Ass'n of Home Builders v. EPA, 667 F.3d 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (denying plaintiffs standing to review permits that would allow for pollution discharges into certain waters, because the plaintiff-organization's alleged human-injury was insufficient; instead of focusing on the water pollution, plaintiffs had to create a plaintiff-specific injury, which in this case was that they had to spend money, time, and resources on this litigation to clarify Clean Water Act jurisdiction. The court found this injury to be insufficient for standing purposes because plaintiffs failed to show that these expenditures were for "operational costs beyond those normally expended" to carry out the organization's advocacy mission.); Arias v. Dyncorp, 738 F. Supp. 2d 46 (D.C. 2010) (plaintiffs did not have standing because, in a suit alleging defendant's actions had released pesticides on plaintiffs' land, plaintiffs could only show harmful environmental effects on the land and water, but not to the plaintiffs themselves; Emerald Coast Utils.

Fl. 2010) (water utility company was denied standing in lawsuit alleging that defendant's negligent discharges had contaminated ground water wells used to supply drinking-water - the standing inquiry was not about polluted ground water, but rather whether plaintiffs had claimed adequate "fear" of harmful effects on their health as a result of defendant's actions); Lewis v. FMC Corp., 786 F. Supp. 2d 690</page><page sequence="29">2013] Standing and Environmental Harm 83 A standing rule requiring plaintiffs to assert injuries to themselves does not serve the statutory purpose of environmental law, and provides no legitimate connection to the actual harm suffered. Further, a plaintiff-injury requirement is nonsensical in environmental citizen suit litigation because the harm that the statute seeks to avoid is usually not to a person, but to an environmental good, like the atmosphere or a river. The intent of Congress is to benefit both that environmental asset and the common good.140 When Congress has signaled its intent to further enforcement of such statutory violations through a private right of action, a particularized human-injury pre-requisite is both inconsistent with legislative intent regarding enforcement of the law, and destructive of statutory goals.141 5. Harm to Animals A final class of litigation involving natural objects is when defendants have allegedly caused harm to an animal in violation of a statute. These cases depict the disparity between the animal harm sought to be prevented by a statute, and the plaintiff injury that is necessary to satisfy standing. In a lawsuit brought against a circus owner, a former bam-helper alleged mistreatment of Asian elephants, where for standing purposes the barn-helper claimed he would suffer aesthetic and emotional injuries if he visited the elephants while they exhibited stress-related behavior from the maltreatment.142 The court held that allegations of "emotional attachment, coupled with [a] desire to visit the elephants and [an] ability to recognize the effects of mistreatment," would be sufficient to satisfy the injury requirement to establish standing, but plaintiffs had nevertheless failed to credibly prove that the barn-helper had a "personal and emotional attachment" to the particular elephants with which he worked, and thus, did not have (W.D.N. Y. 2011) (plaintiffs did not satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement because they did not show that defendant's mishandling of waste resulting in water and air contamination would harm the individual plaintiffs' health in particular; for standing, the court was not concerned about the pollution to the water or air, or even about the harm to human health in general); Ohio Valley Envtl. Coal., Inc. v. Maple Coal Co., 808 F. Supp. 2d 868 (S.D. W. Va. 2011) (defendant's discharges of selenium, in violation of statute, could not be litigated by the plaintiff-organization because the members' assertions of injury involving use of the waterway were for the sole purpose of monitoring it for litigation-related reasons; the court demanded more personalized aesthetic or recreational injury, regardless of the selenium poisoning of the river). 140 See, e.g., Cassuto, supra note 25, at 87. 141 The resulting tension between Congress' conferral of a private right of action to enforce environmental statutes, and the Court's unwillingness to recognize the scope of that conferral, precludes lawsuits that allege environmental harm. Id. at 87-88. 142 Feld Entertainment , 659 F.3d at 18.</page><page sequence="30">84 Virginia Environmental Law Journal [Vol. 3 1 :55 Standing to sue.143 Here, it was irrelevant to the court that Congress' intent was to prevent mistreatment of animals. It was also irrelevant whether the elephants themselves had been harmed. The standing inquiry was only focused on whether one human barn-helper had a sufficient "emotional attachment" to the animal. The Injury Paradox creates a logical gap between the real harm at issue (to the animal) and the purpose of the underlying statute (avoid harms to animals), and the judge-made requirements for Article III (show human harm).144 b. THE PLAINTIFF PARADOX IN LOWER COURTS The Plaintiff Paradox arises where the Court's injury-in-fact requirement, a requirement not mandated by the Constitution,145 forces plaintiffs to transform legitimate claims of environmental harm into "made up" personal, value-based injuries.146 To meet the Court's standing test in environmental litigation, the human-injury is often presented in the form of a psychological self-interest. Plaintiffs generally assert an injury to their feelings, manifested as a harm to aesthetic or recreational interests.147 In reality, these injuries are nothing more than an expression of feelings, usually emotions of sadness, anger or fear, which are only incidentally related to the real environmental or animal injury. The Court's injury condition results in environmental plaintiffs asserting personalized emotional harms that seem 1« Id. at 21. 144 See also Sixth Angel Shepherd Rescue, Inc. v. West, 790 F. Supp. 2d 339 (E.D. Penn. 2011) (plaintiff, a dog rescue organization, did not have standing to litigate harm to animals, because the only human-injury asserted was plaintiffs frustration about defendant's failure to "obey the law"). 145 Hodits, supra note 40, at 1930 ("Insistence on injury to the plaintiff is a requirement of the Court's own design, a design it claims is necessary to satisfy Article III."); Cassuto, supra note 25, at 101-02 ("When a statute explicitly confers a private right of action in the event of its violation, the Court's demand for further showing of harm imposes an extra-statutory requirement cloaked in the protected rhetoric of Article III."). 146 Carter, supra note 26, at 2205. See also , Maple Coal , 808 F. Supp. 2d at 879 (stating, "[ajmong the injuries that may be addressed by a federal court are those to 'an individual's aesthetic or recreational interests," which "is of particular relevance to environmental cases" (quoting Gaston Copper , 204 F.3d at 154, and Sierra Club , 405 U.S. at 734-36)). 147 Maple Coaly 808 F. Supp. 2d at 879 ("'Environmental plaintiffs' can establish injury in fact by demonstrating 'use [of] the affected area and [that they] are persons 'for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened' by the challenged activity."). Aesthetic and recreational injuries include the ability to view, use, study, or economically benefit from the natural resource or animal. See, e.g.. Ark. Project v. Shaw, 201 1 WL 6033036 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 5, 2011) (court granted standing to a plaintiff-organization based on allegations that its members might experience diminished enjoyment in observing, photographing, studying, and protecting the harmed Whooping Cranes species).</page><page sequence="31">201 3] Standing and Environmental Harm 85 manufactured for the litigation, and contrary to Article III.148 To satisfy Article III, plaintiffs should have a true stake in the outcome of the controversy to ensure that "the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution."149 The purported, purely subjective emotional harms raised by environmental plaintiffs do not assure that those plaintiffs really have any "stake" in the controversy, or an ability to mount a challenge capable of judicial resolution. When these emotions are successfully raised to confer standing in cases involving the five purely ecocentric injuries, the Plaintiff Paradox emerges. I. Destruction and Degradation of Ecosystems It is not difficult to see how a plaintiffs claim of emotional displeasure suffered as a result of a diminished ability to observe butterflies, brought under federal statute intended to protect unique environments, likely lacks the constitutionally required "stake in the outcome.'"50 Yet, that diminished pleasure was deemed sufficient to confer standing to those individuals.151 Sadness caused by the threat of less butterflies was enough of an injury to raise the true ecocentric harm - the destruction of wetlands that were the habitat for the butterflies. In this case, where standing was conferred due to anxiety over diminished butterflies, is not unlike others involving controversies where the injury is to an ecosystem, but standing hinges on some loosely-attenuated and tangential claim of self-interested, value-based emotional injury.152 Those emotional injuries should not be sufficient to 148 See supra note 42 and accompanying text. Article III limits the judicial branch's power of decision to those with a true justiciable "case or controversy," which means a real personal stake in the outcome. Baker, supra note 1 7. The purpose of standing is "to ensure . . . that the scarce resources of the federal courts are devoted to those disputes in which the parties have a concrete stake."

Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 752 (1984). The idea that this personal stake must be an "injury-in-fact" dates from the Court's 1970 decision in Data Processing , 397 U.S. 150 (1970).

The purpose of standing doctrine is to find a plaintiff able to ensure "that the scarce resources of the federal courts are devoted to those disputes [involving a real 'case or controversy']."155 Where a plaintiff is granted standing based on some vague aesthetic injury, there is no reasonable guarantee that the underlying threatened endangered species will be protected by that plaintiff. The kind of anthropocentric emotional injury raised in these cases lacks a direct connection to the actual ecocentric harm that has occurred and is protected by statute. The human injury asserted seems often frivolous, especially when all a court requires is an assertion that the threatened extinction will affect the person's personal enjoyment of the area, aesthetically or recreationally.156 Such harms do not presume that the plaintiff is so emotionally, enthusiastically, and financially enlisted in the greater cause of species' protection that a court can be assured that the plaintiff is committed to seeing a long and expensive case through to the end. 3. Climate Change and Global Warming Lower court cases involving underlying injuries to the Earth's weather, producing climate change and global warming, require plaintiffs to similarly allege diminished aesthetic and recreational interests in order to have standing. Environmental plaintiffs have asserted loss of enjoyment in recreational activities such as hiking, birding, skiing, photography, scenic viewing, and cycling, which would follow from the effects of global warming causing poor air quality and other undesirable effects on the environment.157 When there is a possible violation of statutes seeking to protect the environment from climate change and global warming, it seems foolish to grant standing to plaintiffs based on their anthropocentric self-interested injuries involving the sadness that follows from not being able to bird or view scenic vistas as before. In these cases the real harm is to the Earth's climate, not to the plaintiffs diminished bird watching (the Injury Paradox).

Further, a standing rule that permits courts to determine who is allowed to litigate based on completely subjective assessments of emotional harm is a rule that will inevitably lead to inconsistent results.158 4. Environmental Pollution In cases involving pollution of an environmental good, such as water, plaintiffs often must allege injury to their recreational or aesthetic values resulting from diminished enjoyment or desirability to use the waters, often brought about by fear of harm caused by contact with the contaminated water.159 In addition to fear, plaintiffs can successfully allege injury sufficient for standing if they experience emotions of sadness and concern or even anger at seeing a polluted waterway.160 When sadness, fear, and anger become the touchstones determining standing, there is no principled way for courts to decide if a given plaintiffs emotional state has risen to the point that standing may be conferred. Perhaps realizing the inherent subjectivity in these judgment calls over emotional states, courts sometimes turn to the plaintiffs' "use" of the environmental area as the pivotal factor in the injury-in-fact analysis. Some courts strictly adhere to the requirement that the plaintiff use the specifically damaged environment, demanding that a plaintiff "must use the area affected by the challenged activity and not an area roughly 'in the vicinity of it.""61 Other courts relax this standard, granting standing to plaintiffs who wish to protect a wetland area at risk of destruction, even though the plaintiffs' asserted "use" is only to a nearby state park, but not to the wetland.162 Not only are lower courts inconsistent in deciding where the plaintiffs use must take place, courts also act arbitrarily when considering the "imminence" and "concreteness" of plaintiffs' future "use" assertions.163 This inconsistency stems from lower courts' differing interpretations of the imminent injury-in-fact requirement as 158 Contrast Natural Resources Defense Counsel, id., with Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, 2010 WL 4782976 (D. Utah Nov. 16, 2010), where plaintiffs were denied standing to show the harm to the planet caused by climate change because their potential emotional injuries were too "speculative." 159 See, e.g., Maple Coal, 808 F.

The more regular a plaintiffs prior use of the area at risk, the less specificity required for a finding of a sufficiently concrete injury, even if the use is relatively infrequent.166 On the other hand, less regularity of use, lacking a showing of a "well- established trend, pattern, habit, or practice," means that the future plans must be particular and non-speculative to be a sufficiently concrete and imminent injury.167 Some lower courts go even further, and also look to the plaintiffs residential proximity to the affected area, presuming that a far-away plaintiff is less likely to use the area, while a plaintiff who resides in the area inherently meets the "use" requirement.168 Other lower courts have a different judge-specific calculus for deciding when there is an acceptable nexus between the area being impacted and the precise location where the plaintiff alleges personal use. Such subjectivity yields odd results: One court may find that a plaintiff is sufficiently saddened by potentially diminished enjoyment in recreational activities in an area 16.5 miles away from the origin of the pollution,169 while another may just as rationally conclude that a plaintiffs use of a river 8.5 miles away from the site of pollution origination does not indicate that the plaintiff will likely suffer incidental injury from the actual environmental harm.170 164 To show a sufficiently imminent injury, the Summers Court stated that "'some day* intentions-without any description of concrete plans, or indeed any specification of when the some day will be-do not support a finding of the 'actual or imminent' injury that our cases require.'" 550 U.S. at 1 148, 1 150-51, 1153. •65 S.

Inconsistent outcomes exacerbate the flaws in the human injury requirement, so it is often impossible to point out any distinguishing factual basis between those plaintiffs asserting sufficiently injured self-interests and those who have not. But lower courts still demand a showing of injury to the plaintiff, despite the fact that the injuries that are alleged (1) have virtually nothing to do with the injury to the natural object that is the subject of the lawsuit, and (2) are not predictors of the plaintiffs ability and willingness to mount an effective lawsuit. 5. Harm to Animals While a plaintiffs diminished desire to swim in a polluted river has at least some connection, however attenuated, to the real affected interest - the river itself - that connection becomes even more remote when it consists of a plaintiffs sadness that follows from a concern that certain animals may be mistreated. In such cases, the plaintiffs only "concrete stake" in litigation to hold defendants accountable for harming animals is often nothing more than sadness about diminished opportunities to view healthy, happy animals.172 A person's sadness about diminished viewing opportunities simply cannot begin to carry with it the same weight or significance as the injury actually endured by mistreated animals. Moreover, if these animals cannot raise their own interests, there are competent, well-funded, dedicated animal rights organizations that do have the expertise, resources, and commitment to seek redress for the injuries of these animals. However, to surmount the based on plaintiffs own observations and study of downstream impacts caused by upstream urbanization, were too "general and speculative" to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement for standing.). 171 See, e.g., Hodits, supra note 40, at 1931 (discussing the inherently value-laden nature of a judge's choice between determinations of "actual and imminent" or "speculative and abstract"). 172 In Def. of Animals v.

V. CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF THE DOUBLE PARADOX The Double Paradox has multiple problematic effects. Its presence in federal litigation may thwart Congress' attempts to protect the environment. As a result, natural resources and animals that cannot litigate for themselves may be significantly impaired. Environmental organizations may be prevented from asserting true ethical grievances about purely ecocentric environmental harms and injuries to animals, when they are routinely denied standing to litigate on behalf of natural objects. Since these organizations cannot raise the interests of the harmed natural asset, they must find individuals who allege subjective self-interested claims in the form of, and often frivolous, injured feelings. Even the courts risk loss of respect by imposing demands on entry into the judicial system that yield inconsistent application of an already incoherent environmental litigation standing test.174 These problems arise because the Supreme Court requires as a prerequisite to standing some plaintiff-particular, usually human, injury that is neither constitutionally mandated, nor consistent with the purpose of Article III. Another cause of these standing difficulties is the Court's insistence that standing may not be granted to organizations and associations in their own right, even though they are dedicated to protecting, by litigation, natural resources and objects protected by statute. a. THE INJURY PARADOX A standing requirement in environmental litigation that is grounded in "injury-to-the-plaintiff' is not required by the Constitution.175 It also contradicts congressional purpose and forces plaintiffs to allege seemingly manufactured, disingenuous claims of emotional injury, which belie a real concrete stake in the litigation consistent with Article III. By requiring a plaintiff-injury, the courts ignore the real underlying 173 See supra note 36 and accompanying text. 174 Carter, supra note 26, at 2208. 175 Cassuto, supra note 25, at 127. See also Hodits, supra note 40, at 1930 (noting that "the injury in fact requirement lacks a constitutional basis and allows judges to bar court access based on their own ideologies."). The Court's injury requirement is based on a "standard that is normatively laden and independent of facts." Sunstein, supra note 45, at 188-89.</page><page sequence="38">92 Virginia Environmental Law Journal [Vol. 31:55 injury to the natural object, which is the focus of the statute alleged to have been violated. Instead, the courts concentrate on whether the plaintiff has an anthropocentric injury that the underlying statute does not address. Further, the type of human injuries plaintiffs are forced to assert to achieve standing in a lawsuit arising from violation of an environmental protective statute are generally subjective in nature, involving varying levels of sadness, fear, or anger at the prospect of losing some recreational or aesthetic experience. An injury test grounded in human feelings will yield arbitrary and inconsistent results. The Injury Paradox stems from two faulty assumptions by the Supreme Court. First, the Court denies standing when the injury alleged is to "the environment.'"76 Second, the Court requires that even when the environment is, in fact, harmed, the injury must be "to the plaintiff.'"77 By placing emphasis on the individual human-plaintiff bringing the lawsuit, the interests of the harmed or threatened natural object are inevitably diminished, while the legitimacy of a plaintiff's feelings-injuries becomes an unpredictable judicial judgment.178 Not surprisingly, the value-laden nature of environmental-plaintiffs' injuries, as well as the inconsistent and varying determination of whether an emotion or feeling is an adequately alleged injury,179 confuses potential plaintiffs and weakens the public's faith in the courts.180 The Injury Paradox also has the unfortunate tendency to encourage those seeking to protect against ecocentric damage to find a plaintiff whose injury is anthropocentric, usually consisting of some emotional angst due to the threatened demise of a natural resource or object. Such plaintiffs appear to value the environment or living organism only insofar as these natural assets affect their own selfish aesthetic or recreational desires. The injury asserted for standing is not to the natural resource, but to the personal emotional health of some human, who might feel psychologically dissatisfied if he or she, for example, is no longer able to view butterflies because the entire ecosystem has been Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 181. 177 Id. This insistence that injury be to the plaintiff is consistent with the Supreme Court's general rule against third-party standing. See Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U. S. 106, 1 13-14 (1976); The Wilderness Society v. Kane County, 632 F. 3d 1 162, 1 171 (10th Cir. 201 1). 178 See, e.g., Cassuto, supra note 25, at 86-87; Webster, supra note 25, at 461; Hodits, supra note 40, at 1929-30 ("[T]he Court applies the injury requirement inconsistently, finding some harm concrete, distinct, palpable, actual, or imminent, while finding other harm merely speculative."). 179 Compare Gouger and Gulf Restoration Network, supra note 152 (plaintiffs injury in being unhappy about the prospect of not seeing birds was adequate for standing), with Emerald Coast Utilities Authority, supra note 139, and Sixth Angel, supra note 143 (plaintiffs injury inadequate for standing because the negative emotion was either in the future, or not sufficiently grave vet). 180 Cassuto, supra note 25, at 81, 127.</page><page sequence="39">2013] Standing and Environmental Harm 93 destroyed.181 When the gravamen of the underlying statutory violation involves the butterflies' ecosystem, one wonders how the interests of Article III are furthered by a standing rule that presumes sad butterfly watchers have the requisite stake in the outcome to defend, in protracted litigation, a threatened ecosystem.182 Conversely, the Injury Paradox has the equally unfortunate tendency to discourage redress of injuries to nature and natural objects. For example, the Court's particularized (usually anthropocentric) injury requirement makes it difficult for courts to consider broad-based, purely ecocentric harms to entire natural systems.183 And, the Court's insistence on an injury to a plaintiff, and not to the environment, means that certain environments, natural resources, wildlife species, and animals may lack an enforcement mechanism to redress violation of laws that are designed to protect not the plaintiff, but some natural objects and nature.184 b. The Plaintiff Paradox The Plaintiff Paradox was created by the Supreme Court's persistence in granting standing to plaintiffs who assert as injuries negative emotions and feelings about some ecocentric harm. These psychological injuries lack traditional "case and controversy" values, but they are often deemed sufficient for standing purposes. Conversely, organizations are denied standing whose interests and ability to litigate fall squarely within the class of parties who are capable of bringing a case within Article III. In Sierra Clubff5 the Court stated that the injury requirement is adequately asserted by environmental-plaintiffs when they allege use of affected natural areas and anthropocentric injury in the form of diminished aesthetic and recreational values.186 The injury, however, is not that aesthetic or recreational values will be lessened, but that the plaintiff will feel sad, frustrated, or angry when the plaintiff goes to the area being harmed and realizes that aesthetic values, for instance, are reduced. Sierra Club creates this anomaly: Human emotions of sadness or anger are deemed sufficient for standing, despite the fact that the underlying harm is not to humans but to nature. However, an environmental organization's legitimate concern about the 181 See Am. Bottom Conservancy , 650 F.3d 652 (7th Cir. 201 1). 182 Cassuto, supra note 25, at 97, 100-03. 183 Babcock, supra note 22, at 4, 10 (Environmental harms frequently affect the commons, in which "few, if any, have distinct and particularized legal interests."). 184 Carter, supra note 26, at 2205. i83 504 U.S. 719(1972). 186 Id. at 735.</page><page sequence="40">94 Virginia Environmental Law Journal [Vol. 3 1 : 5 5 health and viability of the affected natural area protected by statute is not sufficient for standing. Furthermore, it is irrelevant that the organization does in fact have the resources and expertise to litigate the controversy on the merits, while the sad plaintiff typically is not going to be able to do so. In Lujan,™ the Court concluded that organizations can litigate on behalf of natural objects, but must still meet the "constitutional minimum of standing" to do so.188 As such, individual members of the organization must be able to prove that they satisfy the three essential elements of standing, beginning with the injury-to-plaintiff rule, in their own right.189 When pursuing lawsuits under environmental or animal protective laws, the Lujan Court strictly adhered to an anthropocentric focus with respect to the injury-in-fact requirement; members of plaintiff-organizations must assert injuries that are sufficiently "particularized," that is, they must allege claims of harm that "affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way," where the individual plaintiff must be "himself among the injured."190 Without such a plaintiff, specialized, competent, well-funded, dedicated environmental organizations are precluded from litigating on behalf of natural objects directly.191 The Sierra Club and Lujan cases combine to demand that when there is a purely ecocentric harm, to a unique ecosystem or endangered species, standing is almost always conditioned on finding some plaintiff who has suffered, or who will suffer, an anthropocentric injury because of the ecocentric injury.192 Laidlawm reaffirmed the Court's insistence of plaintiff-injury for standing. Laidlaw reiterated the notion that injury to the natural object is irrelevant for purposes of standing. Even where a defendant's actions violate the law, or otherwise cause a definitive injury to the natural object at issue, standing will not be afforded to plaintiffs that are unable to show their own derivative emotional or psychological injury stemming from that ecocentric injury.194 187 Lujan, 504 U.S. 555.

See, e.g., Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007) (The particularized injury to the state caused by climate change was an eroding shoreline). 193 528 U.S. 167 (2000). Id. at 181.</page><page sequence="41">2013] Standing and Environmental Harm 95 Environmental organizations are usually seeking to promote the same ecocentric interests as those furthered by statutes that protect natural objects. However, the Court's standing rule bars them from doing so on behalf of the injured, non-human natural entity. These organizations must therefore find individual members who are able to meet the Court's injury-in-fact requirement.195 In reality, this injury-to-plaintiff condition results in disingenuous claims, by forcing plaintiffs to mask real environmental concerns as self-centered feelings-injuries.196 Further, a court's grant of standing to environmental plaintiffs who assert self-interested value-laden injuries to satisfy the human-injury requirement is itself contrary to Article III. An individual merely alleging some loosely attenuated, incidental human-injury from a diminished aesthetic or recreational interest cannot be said to adequately, or even logically, have a "personal stake in the outcome," or be capable of ensuring that the case is presented in the requisite adversarial context. Indeed, even members of the Supreme Court acknowledge that such plaintiff feelings-injuries are mere "subjective apprehension" that should be "legally insufficient" for establishing injury-in-fact in environmental litigation.197 Conversely, an environmental organization, dedicated to the protection of natural objects identical to the purpose of the violated statute, would meet this constitutional requirement of having a personal stake. But such organizations that have the will and desire to pursue Article III litigation are routinely denied the opportunity to vindicate the real injuries suffered by natural objects without a voice of their own. The purpose of the Article III standing requirement is for the plaintiff to (1) have a personal stake in the outcome, and (2) to be able to adjudicate the dispute so that it can be judicially resolved.198 Environmental organizations satisfy that purpose while emotionally affected bird watchers and river rafters do not. VI. TOWARDS A MORE COHERENT STANDING TEST WHEN THE INJURY IS TO NATURE Several remedies have been suggested that have the potential to address many of the problems of the Double Paradox.199 The most effective and logical way to resolve the Double Paradox for environmental litigation is to allow credible and competent advocates - i« ld.' Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490 (1975). 196 Carter, supra note 26, at 2208-09. 197 Laidlaw , 528 U.S. at 199, 201. 198 See supra note 28 and accompanying text. 199 See infra Part V B-D.</page><page sequence="42">96 Virginia Environmental Law Journal [Vol. 3 1 : 55 typically established environmental organizations - to have standing to sue on behalf of injured natural objects protected by statute. The required "injury" that would need to be asserted would be an injury to the natural object, not to the organization. Standing should be granted only to organizations with the commitment and resources necessary to establish a true "stake in the outcome" in a lawsuit that seeks to redress harms to the environment, natural objects, or animals. Such an organizational standing concept is recognized and followed in other countries, and such a model is consistent with the purposes of Article Ill's "case and controversy" requirement: When there is an organization advocating for natural resources or natural objects, the parties are truly adverse, and they have a real concrete stake in the outcome of the litigation. Further, granting environmental organizations standing would promote underlying congressional purposes - to protect natural objects from harm. Organizational standing acknowledges that the relevant harms for both standing and the merits of the lawsuit are harms to the environment, natural objects, and animals, rather than to humans. a. THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD GRANT ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCACY ASSOCIATIONS STANDING When the underlying injury is to nature or natural objects, the Supreme Court should grant standing to environmental organizations with the commitment and resources to effectively bring a lawsuit on behalf of those injured natural assets. Such standing to sue on behalf of another entity would build on other examples of permissible third-party standing, such as the overbreadth doctrine, declaratory judgments, and class actions.200 The relevant interests for standing would be protected natural environments, resources, or animals, but not a particularized human-injury.20' Organization or association standing would be similar to the actio popularis doctrine, which has been adopted in other countries, especially Great Britain.202 Under an expanded actio popularis theory, a court could grant standing to anyone bringing an action to defend rights of a natural object, so long as that person (1) can sufficiently show an actual or imminent injury to the natural object, and (2) demonstrate that the potential litigant also has a "sufficient interest" in the outcome.203 The "sufficient interest" condition ensures that the entities permitted to raise the interests of natural resources would be appropriate litigators. 200 See Compitello, supra note 27, at 310-12, 318-20. 201 Babcock, supra note 22, at 13. 202 See Bassi, supra note 39. 2°3 Id. at 473-74.</page><page sequence="43">20 1 3] Standing and Environmental Harm 97 The sufficient interest condition would narrow the scope of natural resources advocates to organizations with knowledge of the injured resources or ecosystem, a genuine interest in protecting the resource, and adequate economic means and expertise to adequately represent the interest in litigation.204 Allowing organizations standing to protect the environment or some natural object would redirect the focus from human harms to the injured natural object. As such, this would shift courts' standing inquiry from whether an organization has been able to find one of its members who has been sufficiently saddened by the real environmental harm, to instead looking at whether the organization demonstrates "sufficient interest" in remedying, by litigation, the real injury and statutory violation.205 By combining the actio popularis concept (an entity may defend a natural resource's rights) with a "sufficient interest" requirement (only responsible parties may sue), concerns about granting standing to an insufficiently prepared litigant, or creating a "race-to-the- court" possibility, are largely eliminated.206 Countries around the world have embraced the idea of permitting environmental organizations to litigate the interests of harmed natural resources. British courts, for example, have continued to liberalize standing requirements, focusing on whether potential plaintiffs are "serious litigants," with a "genuine interest in the issues raised," rather than a "meddlesome busybody."207 Likewise, British courts look at whether the organization has a "genuine concern for the cause purported," and also consider whether denying standing to the organization would mean that no one has standing to bring the lawsuit.208 204 Jan G.

CONGRESS SHOULD CREATE A GOVERNMENT CORPORA TION WITH THE POWER TO SUE Another possible way to eliminate the Double Paradox in environmental litigation is the creation of a government corporation with the power to sue on behalf of protected natural objects.220 Congress could create entities endowed with the power to sue in federal court by amending the definition of "persons" found in citizen suit provisions to include, for example, "any group designated as such by the Secretary of the Interior."221 These government corporations may be created to pursue the policy goal of advocating for the legally protected interests of natural goods, and because they have an independent legal existence, they can pursue vindication of these legal rights in court.222 There are certain limitations to this model, however. First, for purposes of standing, the focus would be, again, on something other than the real injury to the natural object. Since the "environmental corporation" would have the discretion to determine whether an environmental resource needs advocacy in court, the process may be politicized. Second, the creation of such an environmental corporation ignores the current existence of non-governmental organizations dedicated to the protection of the environment or animals, such as Sierra Club, Greenpeace or the National Audubon Society. These organizations already are able to vigorously litigate the rights of natural objects.

CONGRESS SHOULD CREATE AN ARTICLE I TRIBUNAL TO ADJUDICATE ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS The Double Paradox could likewise be eliminated by expanding Article I jurisdiction to allow for the resolution of environmental claims in Article I courts.223 This theory finds support in the separation of powers doctrine, and the traditional role played by Article I courts to adjudicate public rights cases.224 Plaintiffs would bring environmental lawsuits in Article I courts under existing citizen suit provisions, so that restrictive Article III standing requirements would not apply.225 Plaintiffs would no longer have to disguise true environmental claims in terms of human-injury, and could focus instead on rights held by natural objects themselves.226 Additionally, Article I adjudication may be seen as providing the inherent benefit of a jurisdictional limit, restricting the court to those claims involving only public matters.227 However, because Article I courts can only adjudicate rights established in federal law, claims arising from state or common law sources would still be subject to the traditional standing requirements, and thus, the Double Paradox.228 Further, resolution in Article I courts forces environmental claims into a political realm.229 Since Article I judges would not enjoy the independence of Article III judges, their decisions about environmental goods being threatened by economic growth would be subject to intense political scrutiny. d. THE COURTS SHOULD GIVE NA TURE A RIGHT TO SUE ON ITS OWN BEHALF The simplest solution to the Double Paradox is to give a natural object the right to sue on its own behalf.230 The standing inquiry in environmental litigation would then be identical to cases involving 223 Carter, supra note 26, at 2232-34; Hodits, supra note 40. 224 Hodits, supra note 40, at 1937-38; Carter, supra note 26. 225 Carter, supra note 26, at 2212 226 Laitos, supra note 203, at 224. 227 Hodits, supra note 40, at 1937. 228 Laitos, supra note 204, at 224-25. 229 Carter, supra note 26, at 221 1-22. 230 Carter, supra note 26, at 2222.

To have standing, the natural object would only have to show violation of a statute, resulting in harm to it, the natural object.231 Of course, because natural resources and environmental goods are inanimate objects, their ability to sue would likely require some guardianship component. Following a guardian ad litem concept, a natural object may assert its own rights by allowing a guardian to litigate on its behalf. This concept is employed in other contexts, allowing third parties to litigate for others under a guardianship theory, appointed to represent those that are not competent or are otherwise unable to represent themselves.232 The guardian would seek an outcome that furthers the best interests of the natural object it is representing. This model finds support in other areas of law, and would allow the underlying, real injury to the environment, natural resource, or animal, to suffice for standing, and remain the focus of the litigation.233 Practical problems with the guardian model affect its workability. For example, it might prove unrealistic to hold the courts accountable to sua sponte appoint a guardian for an injured natural object, without some other entity to institute the legal action.234 The question also remains as to whom or what would be an ideal guardian for the environment or species at issue. Such a guardian could be an attorney designated under an "orphan" theory, similar to attorneys designated by courts to represent an "orphaned" argument - one that is essential to the case, but has been abandoned by the parties.235 For this theory to work, however, there would need to be pending litigation affecting a natural resource, and it would not be applicable when the offending conduct goes unchallenged.236 Moreover, appointing a guardian in every case where there is a need to adequately represent the rights of the natural object at issue subjects the process to continued inconsistent outcomes. It seems preferable, and more efficient, to grant standing to a well- established, capable environmental or animal-rights organization with a genuine concern about the natural object at issue, whose rights the organization seeks to redress. 231 Carter, supra note 26, at 2222-24; Sierra Club , 405 U.S. at 741-44, 750-51 (J. Douglass, dissenting). The natural object would still have to meet the causation and redressability standing requirements. 232 Carter, supra note 26, at 2223 (such as persons appointed as guardians to represent juveniles or incompetent adults). 233 See Christopher Stone, Should Trees Have Standing?
