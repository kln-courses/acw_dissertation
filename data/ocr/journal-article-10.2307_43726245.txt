<plain_text><page sequence="1">Seymour GITIN, J. edward wright, and J. P. DESSEL (eds.), Confronting the Past: Archaeological and Historical Essays on Ancient Israel in Honor of William G. Dever (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2006). Pp. xxiv + 376. $69.50. The prodigious influence of William Dever on virtually every aspect of Syro- Palestinian archaeology, demonstrated not only in almost three hundred books, articles, and reviews but also in countless lectures and participation in international conferences, is reflected both in the number of articles contributed to this festschrift and in their variety. The essays in this large-format book are divided into three loose categories: (1) Archaeology, (2) Bible, and (3) Ancient Near East. As befits Dever's own interests, the majority of the arti- cles deal with the Bronze and Iron Ages. There is an exhaustive bibliography of Dever's writings and indexes of authors, Scripture references, and ancient sources. In addition, each article includes a very extensive bibliography. Part 1 includes seventeen essays not only about artifacts but also concerning the more theoretical aspects of Israel/Palestine archaeology: Amnon Ben-Tor, "The Sad Fate of Statues and the Mutilated Statues of Hazor" (pp. 3-16); Giorgio Buccellati, "An Archaeolo- gist on Mars" (pp. 17-22); Shlomo Bunimovitz and Raphael Greenberg, "Of Pots and Par- adigms: Interpreting the Intermediate Bronze Age in Israel/Palestine" (pp. 23-32); Trude</page><page sequence="2">COLLECTED ESSAYS 1 93 Dothan, "A Decorated Ivory Lid from Tel Miqne-Ekron" (pp. 33-40); Barry M. Gittlen, "Har Resisim 126: An Ephemeral Early Bonze Age Site" (pp. 41-50); James W. Hardin and Joe D. Seger, "Gezer Rectified: The Dating of the South Gate Complex" (pp. 51-60); Larry G. Herr, "An Iron Age I House with a Cultic Corner at Tall al-cUmayri, Jordan" (pp. 61-74); Vassos Karageorghis, "Aphrodite/Aštarte on Horseback" (pp. 75-80); Albert Leonard, Jr., "Planning a Paleolithic Picnic" (pp. 81-84); Paolo Matthiae, "The Archaic Palace at Ebla: A Royal Building Between Early Bronze Age IVB and Middle Bronze Age I" (pp. 85-104); Amihai Mazar, "Tel Beth-Shean and the Fate of Mounds in the Intermediate Bronze Age" (pp. 105-18); Suzanne Richard, "Early Bronze Age IV Transitions: An Archaeometallurgical Study" (pp. 119-32); Steven A. Rosen, Sorin Hermon, Jacob Vardi, and Yael Abadi, "The Chipped Stone Assemblage from Be'er Resisim in the Negev High- lands: A Preliminary Study" (pp. 133-44); Ilan Sharon and Anabel Zarzecki-Peleg, "Podium Structures with Lateral Access: Authority Ploys in Royal Architecture in the Iron Age Lev- ant" (pp. 145-68); Lawrence E. Stager, "Chariot Fittings from Philistine Ashkelon" (pp. 169-76); Ephraim Stern, "Goddesses and Cults at Dor" (pp. 177-80); and Stuart Swiny, "Cypriot Anthropomorphic Figurines of a Certain Type" (pp. 181-86). The theoretical articles in part 1 are often disappointing. For example, after a long jargon-laced discussion of "processual" and "postprocessual" archaeology in the study by Bunimovitz and Greenberg, the reader awaits some new light on the mysteries of the IB period, but finds large platters, the hallmark of EB III, give way to cups and other drinking vessels of the IBA, testifying to a shift in emphasis in food consumption from feasting to drink- ing. That having been established, the postprocessual discourse kicks in: why did IBA people choose this specific mode at this specific time, and what element of social interaction is underlined in this practice? (p. 28) Shades of labeling unidentifiable items "cultic"! Matthiae's contribution on Ebla documents some very significant relationships with areas south, notably the EB IA pottery (pp. 96-99), which, in contrast to the pottery of this period from some relatively nearby sites, is much like that of Palestine. Note also the Hyksos nefer-ka-ra scarab (p. 100). This single spouted IB lamp from Amihai Mazar 's Tel Beth- Shean study (p. 112) is most unusual, but the stratigraphy seems sound. This article is extremely useful in general in the effort to understand the puzzling IB period. Finally, the resemblance of the EB lithic assemblage from Be'er Resisim (pp. 133-44) to that of Chal- colithic Tuleilat Ghassul is striking. Twelve somewhat shorter articles make up part 2: Susan Ackerman, "Women and the Worship ofYahweh in Ancient Israel" (pp. 189-98); Rainer Albertz, "Purity Strategies and Political Interests in the Policy of Nehemiah" (pp. 199-206); Norman K. Gottwald, "Proto- Globalization and Proto-Secularization in Ancient Israel" (pp. 207-14); Baruch Halpern, "The Miraculous Wine of Cana in Its Galilean Ceramic Context" (pp. 215-18); Ronald Hendel, "The Archaeology of Memory: King Solomon, Chronology, and Biblical Repre- sentation" (pp. 219-30); André Lemaire, "Khirbet el-Qôm and Hebrew and Aramaic Epig- raphy" (pp. 231-38); Aren M. Maier, Oren Ackermann, and Hendrik J. Bruins, "The Ecological Consequences of a Siege: A Marginal Note on Deuteronomy 20:19-20" (pp. 239-44); Carol Meyers, "Hierarchy or Heterarchy? Archaeology and the Theorizing of</page><page sequence="3">194 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 70,2008 Israelite Society" (pp. 245-54); Eric M. Meyers, "Israel and Its Neighbors Then and Now: Revisionist History and the Quest for History in the Middle East Today" (pp. 255-64); Nadav Na'aman, "Ostracon No. 7 from Arad Reconsidered" (pp. 265-68); Anson F. Rainey, "Looking for Bethel: An Exercise in Historical Geography" (pp. 269-74); and Mark S. Smith, "In Solomon's Temple (1 Kings 6-7): Between Text and Archaeology" (pp. 275-82). Ackerman's study proposes that 2 Kgs 23:7 refers to women making clothing for an Asherah cult statue. A surprising omission from her references is Judith Hadley's very rel- evant The Cult of Asherah in Ancient Israel and Judah: Evidence for a Hebrew Goddess (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2000). Hadley is critical of Dever 's interpretation of the Kuntillet cAjrud and el-Qôm material. André Lemaire's article in this section on Khir- bet el-Qôm and Aramaic epigraphy suffers from not reproducing the original texts in ques- tion. The reader is too often left to rely on Lemaire's reconstructions. Those who are familiar with Gottwald's many social analyses of ancient Israel will be at home in his treatment of "proto-globalization" in ancient Israel. In keeping with his gen- eral perspective, his view of globalization at any period is that it is a fundamentally nega- tive reality that ends up oppressing the poor and the marginalized. Some may argue that Gottwald tends to start with a strong "conclusion" and then marshal the evidence a little too selectively to fit it. Halpern's contribution suggests that John's Gospel was in some respects meant to encourage tourism! "[John] created a mythology, based on a commonplace of legerdemain [water into wine as a counterpart to the magical practice of the day], that programmed pil- grim voyages for centuries and inspired an industry at Cana [pottery production] in the tourism trade" (p. 217). The author suggests that although some think that John is ignorant of Israel's geography, he "knew enough to direct devotees to Cana, a rather obscure village in Galilee that plays no role in the other gospels. We know, oddly, that specialized pottery categorized the region in the period at issue" (p. 217). Perhaps the most valuable essay in this section is that of Smith, who critiques Dever 's methodology in detail, most specifically in regard to his central theme of the relationship between biblical text and archaeological evidence. Smith, in this splendid analysis, finds perspectives in Dever's writings, especially in his rhetoric, that are prima facie self- contradicting, inconsistent, or problematic, but he believes that the author's common sense has enabled him to get at the core of realities with deep insight, despite the language. In part 3 are eight essays: Manfred Bietak, "The Predecessors of the Hyksos" (pp. 285-94); David Noel Freedman and David Miano, "'His Seed Is Not': 13th Century bce Israel" (pp. 295-302); Volkmar Fritz, "Solomon and Gezer" (pp. 303-8); John S. Holladay, Jr., "Hezekiah's Tribute, Long-Distance Trade, and the Wealth of Nations ca. 1 ,000-600 bc: A New Perspective" (pp. 309-32); Philip J. King, "Gezer and Circumcision" (pp. 333-40); Theodore J. Lewis, "Covenant and Blood Rituals: Understanding Exodus 24:3-8 in Its Ancient Near Eastern Context" (pp. 341-50); Abraham Malamat, "Trade Relations Between Mari and Hazor (State of Research, 2002)" (pp. 351-56); and Ziony Zevit, "Implicit Popu- lation Figures and Historical Sense: What Happened to 200,150 Judahites in 701 bce?" (pp. 357-66). The contributions in this final section are mostly biblical in orientation, although with reference to other Near Eastern phenomena. The Freedman-Miano article attempts, without archaeological reference, to reconstruct a picture of the "Israel" mentioned in Merenptah's</page><page sequence="4">COLLECTED ESSAYS 1 95 famous 1207 b.c.e. stele, mostly through a reanalysis of the early poetry preserved in Gen- esis 49; Exodus 15; and Deuteronomy 33. They note, in friendly disagreement with Dever, "we respectfully take issue with the assertion that the well of valuable historical informa- tion in the biblical texts has dried up" (p. 295). It could be argued that they do not sufficiently take into account the editorial factors in the biblical texts in question. Fritz's study relating Gezer to Solomon's building campaigns and King's rather intriguing examination of the evidence concerning circumcision at Gezer are both welcome advances on a site that is most identified with Dever. What is rather unusual for a festschrift, almost every article in this volume is not only a tribute to Bill Dever, but actively engages one or another aspect of his scholarship and methodology.
