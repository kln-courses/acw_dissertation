<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES 339 An Ancient Greek Drakos-Tale in Apuleius' Metamorphoses VIII, 19-21 The folktales in Apuleius' Metamorphoses have attracted surprisingly little attention from either folklorists or classicists, with the main exception of the tale of Cupid and Psyche which has been studied closely by many scholars from many different viewpoints.' The ass-tale itself which provides the thread onto which all the other stories are strung, has also received some attention, above all from Walter Anderson,2 who also devoted a short study to the story of Charite and its possible connection with the boarhunt in the Niebelungenlied.3 Other tales in Apuleius, such as the witch-tales of Aristomenes and Thelyphron in books one and two respectively of the romance, have received little notice.4 The dragon tale in book eight has, with the exception of L. Radermacher's false identification of the tale,5 received no attention at all either from students of modern Greek folk literature or from classicists. The aims of this note are, therefore, to suggest why this tale should be considered a prototype of modern Greek drakos-tales, to relate Apuleius' tale to other references to dragons in his romance, and to rekindle the research interests of folklorists in what is Western Europe's oldest surviving Volksbuch. I When Charite commits suicide, her slaves, in fear of new masters, take to the road along with their movable possessions which include the hero-narrator of the romance, Lucius, whose adventures as an ass start in book three. The party halts at a "rich and populous fortified settlement" (8, 15) which is specified in Apuleius' Greek original, as preserved in Pseudo-Lucian's Ass, as Beroea in Macedonia (ch. 34). Before dawn, they leave this town and travel without mishap until they reach a villa, the occupants of which mistake the travelers for brigands and accordingly give them a violent reception (8,17). The fugitive slaves continue on their way until they reach a "grove of tall trees, attractive for its grassy areas" (18). In this seemingly peaceful spot the battered travelers wash and bind their wounds. Meantime an old shepherd appears and when asked whether he has cheese or milk 1The most important studies (1871-1966) have been reprinted in G. Binder and R.

Before the travelers can question him further, the shepherd hurries off leaving them in a state of intense disquiet. Before they can act, another old but large man comes on the scene and tearfully implores the young travelers to pity his old age and help him retrieve his grandson who has fallen into a nearby pit while trying to catch a bird (20). One of the travelers, unhurt in the previous skirmishes with the villagers, volunteers to help the old man while the rest of the party prepare to resume their journey. After a while, receiving no reply to their calls to the absent young man, they send another member of the group to go and find him. Soon the searcher returns, white in the face and says he had "seen the man lying on his back while a monstrous dragon (immanem draconem) pinned him down and chewed his already half-consumed body, but that the pitiful old man was nowhere to be seen" (21). The travelers now realize the meaning of the old shepherd's warning and hurry away. II The above tale has no analogue in surviving Graeco-Roman literature and bears little resemblance to the better known Greek myths about dragon-slayers such as Perseus and Apollo.6 Nor does Apuleius' draco have much in common with the dragon that guards the golden fleece or the dragon which traditionally guards the tree which bears golden apples in the garden of the Hesperides. In short, Apuleius' dragon does not perform any of the functions traditionally carried out by dragons in world mythology: it does not guard a sacred spring, nor does it watch over a treasure.7 It does, however, share one characteristic of at least one Greek dragon. It feeds on the flesh of young human beings, like Andromeda's waterborne adversary. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Apuleius' dragon is that it is a shape-shifter, a characteristic not found in any other Greek or Latin dragon-myths.s Examples of transformations of man to dragon or dragon to man are seemingly rare. Stith Thompson cites only two examples of the former (D199.2. Transformation: man to dragon; English, Irish) and one of the latter (B11.5.1. Dragon's power of self- transformation; Chinese).9 Apuleius does not explicitly say that the "old man" and the dragon are one and the same person, but such a conclusion is supported by the emissary's remark that while the young man was being devoured by the dragon, "the old man was nowhere to be seen." As a tale of metamorphosis the anecdote also fits appropriately into a collection of tales entitled Metamorphoses. 6These and other dragon-myths are exhaustively studied in J. F. Fontenrose, Python, A Study of Delphic Myth and its Origins (New York: Biblo and Tannen, 1974). See also W. R.

It is perhaps sufficient to give as a preeminent example of such a survival, the hundreds of modern Greek versions of the tale of Cupid and Psyche which have been recently studied by Megas (see note 1 above). There are also very many modern Greek tales in which the well-known child-stealing, blood-sucking bogies of ancient Greece play a part, figures such as Gello, Lamia, Mormo and others who endure today long after the disappearance of the more respectable Olympians.10 Another well represented figure in modern Greek folklore is the drakos, described by Megas as "an ogre of immense size and strength in human form ... ,"' 1 a description close to Apuleius' words, "an old man of large stature." J. C. Lawson, summarizing the characteristics of the same figure, says it "is sometimes distinctly anthropomorphic in popular stories .... It is in fact only from the context of the story that it is possible to tell in what shape the dragon is imagined."1 2 Although there appear to be no modern drakos-tales which exactly parallel the incidents in Apuleius' story, it is reasonably clear that the Roman author's draco belongs to the same family as the modern Greek drakos, and, if the interpretation advanced here is correct, is presented by Apuleius in the earliest surviving popular tale to deal with the subject. It is also worth pointing out that a number of modern drakos-tales have been recorded in Macedonia, the area in which Apuleius situates his story.1 3 The source of Apuleius' tale cannot be determined accurately. However, it is generally agreed that this tale does not come from the Greek ass-romance which Apuleius elaborated.14 That it comes from a Greek source, oral or written, like the tale of Cupid and Psyche which was also not in Apuleius' Greek original,1s seems highly probable in view of the geographical situation of the tale and its modern Greek counterparts. 1929), p. 140; C.

Here Psyche is faced with the apparently insuperable problem of filling a small crystal flask with water from the Styx. The lethal obstacle she must overcome is a group of long-necked, ever-vigilant, triple-tongued dragons. Psyche's task is made possible by an eagle which fills the flask for her. Such dragons which guard the waters of a spring or river are well known in the folklore of modern Greece.16 The dragons which appear in the tale of Cupid and Psyche have been connected by R. Merkelbach with the cloak Apuleius' hero-narrator wears in book eleven (24) in the course of his initiation into the mysteries of the goddess Isis when he symbolically visits the underworld (alter mundus). The cloak is richly embroidered with dragons and griffins: Hier ist Lucius rings von Drachen der Unterwelt umgeben. Es ist zu kiihn wenn mann annimmt, der Wege der Psyche an den Drachen vorbei sei bei der Weihe des Lucius dadurch dargestellt worden, das der Myste ein Kleid anzog, das mit Drachen bestickt war. So war er mitten zwischen den Tieren und in Er?sster Todesgefahr. Der Kult hat sich immer solcher andeutenden Darstellungen bedienen mussen. Merkelbach further points out that the dragon in this context is not only a symbol of evil, representative of the world of the dead, but also is "der Fleischfresser (aapnol&amp;yo'), wie die Erde-der Sarkophag" (311) and that whoever overcomes the dragon conquers death. This interpretation is by no means far-fetched since in Egyptian mythology Isis' main enemy is Seth who was not only represented as an ass, the shape Lucius assumes until remetamorphosed by Isis, but also as a dragon (Apep) which is killed by the Egyptian dragon-slayer Horus.' 8 It would be fully consistent with the Isiac symbolism Apuleius introduced into the ass-romance and which Merkelbach and Kerenyi19 have explored so thoroughly, to see the dragon in the tale in the eighth book of the Metamorphoses as representing a threat to Lucius and corresponding to the danger faced by Psyche, the seeker of immortality, when confronted by the dragons in book six. The dragon-cloak worn by Lucius in the final book is thus a retrospective reminder of one of the most macabre dangers to which he was exposed after his transformation into a donkey. Finally, if, as has been argued, Apuleius' senex and draco are one and the same creature, then it would perhaps be legitimate to give draco in this context the meaning "ogre." This meaning is not given for draco in the Oxford Latin Dictionary, Fascicle 3 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971), p. 574. In addition, if Apuleius depended on a Greek 16Megas, Folktales, pp. 200-201 (Alexander seeks the water of life). 17Roman und Mysterium (Munich: C. H. Beck, 1962), p. 340. See also N.
