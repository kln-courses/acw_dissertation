<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE TERM 'RETROACTIVE INHIBITION' Professor Joseph Peterson has recently called in question the fitness of the term 'retroactive inhibition' for the phenomenon which it is meant to designate.' In commenting upon the writer's paper before the twenty-fourth meeting of the Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology he says: "The reviewer would certainly interpret these results in another way than by the assumption of retroactive inhibition which somehow acts back on and undoes certain learn- ing fixed in the past. The paper itself did not, it should be made clear, insist 4G. E. Muller, op. cit., 33. 1J.

But why not discontinue a term that is so objectionable in its implications of a particular interpretation which may be weak?" These comments voice a dissatisfaction with the term in question which others, also, have expressed, and bring clearly to an issue the need for either a new term or an attempt to state clearly the implications of the old one. The writer's entire agreement with Professor Peterson's view that 'retroactive inhibition' cannot be taken to imply a backward operation which undoes learning has been expressed elsewhere.2 Certainly the term can refer legiti- mately only to a particular phenomenon, not to its explanation. The latter is an independent problem for research, which should not be prejudiced by the terminology employed. The use of the term to designate the phenomenon is, however, another matter. As used in the experimental literature, 'retroactive inhibition' signifies only the fact of poorer retention when some activity, usually a learning activity, has been interpolated between an original learning and the measurement of its retention, than when a period of comparative rest has intervened.3 The inter- polated activity 'retroacts' the original only in a metaphorical sense. It is as if the interpolated material acted backward on the original. According to the major theories of the phenomenon, the interpolated material either stops a perseveration of the processes involved in the original learning, with what amounts to a resulting poorer learning thereof than would have occurred under the rest condition, or else the actual items of the interpolated activity become confused with the items of the original, with a resulting diminution in the re- tention of the latter. Whether either theory is adequate is not here an issue. The point is that neither assumes, and that probably no other theory may be expected to assume, a backward working effect. If we grant that the phenomenon described is the one indicated by the current words "retroactive inhibition," the question becomes that of the ad- visability of the use of a somewhat metaphorical term for it. While granting the descriptive inexactness of the designation 'retroactive inhibition,' certain things may be said in its defense. (I) Its major justification is its long-con- tinued use by students of the phenomenon since the early work of Miiller and Pilzecker. There is little to be gained, and there is much to be lost, by discard- ing an historically sanctioned term, if it can be defined accurately and unmis- takably. There is small doubt that 'retroactive inhibition' can be so defined. (2) If accurately defined as a phenomenon, with no implication of an explana- tion, it can lead to no confusion. And (3) there is good warrant in scientific convention for the use of terms much more metaphorical than the one in ques- tion. 'Refractory phase,' for example, carries the anthropomorphic implica- tion of disobedience or obstinacy. A muscle fiber in refractory phase is as if it were obstinate, but no physiologist falls into the error of ascribing anthropo- 2E. S. Robinson and F. R.

Rev., 33, 1926, 237-244) to confine the term to cases of permanent loss of associates, excluding all emotional and affective influence, would not affect the general suitability of the term as such.</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND DISCUSSIONS 457 morphic obstinacy thereto. Nor does a physicist misunderstand the term 'attraction.' If science were to eschew metaphor and adhere to descriptive exactness in its terms, a remaking of some of its fundamental vocabulary would be required. It may readily be granted that one might, of course, substitute a more des- criptive term such as intercurrent blocking, but the reasons adduced for the con- tinued use of the term retroactive inhibition urge strongly against any substitution.
