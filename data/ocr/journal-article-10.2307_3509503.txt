<plain_text><page sequence="1">examination of the human fascination with the non-human, natural world. This quibble aside, the introduction offers a useful summary of ecocriticism to date and issues a most welcome plea for something 'harder-edged' to carry us forward. Foremost is the repeated focus on the actual, tangible things that constitute 'nature', recognition of which is a salutary corrective to the habit of taking refuge in the declaration that 'nature' is just a concept. Of course, to some extent it is a concept, and the descriptions of the external world that form the focus of this book necessarily reflect the prevailing concepts, even if they also seek to refine them. That is not contested here, but Oerlemans is justified in repeatedly returning us to the 'materiality of nature' that underpins the concepts and descriptions. Indeed, the strength of this book is that the inevitable discussions of the Wordsworths (William more than Dorothy), Shelley, and Coleridge appear alongside engaged and illumi- nating sections on travel writing and natural history, figuring less familiar names, such as Erasmus Darwin, and William Gilpin. Nor is Oerlemans bound solely to the Romantic period when dealing with theory; there is more than a nod towards twentieth-century and current debates, with some sharp criticism (and due praise) levelled at feminism in particular as well as passing reference to, for example, Todorov. Generally the pattern of the chapters is: reiteration of the themes of this book, followed by a more generalized discussion of the chapter's particular topic, followed by illustrative consideration of particular authors and texts. It is a decent enough pattern, which allows White and Clare to counterbalance the prevalent desire for categorizing, and lets Shelley's vegetarian- ism be understood as a political and philosophical conviction, not just a fad. There is also a welcome admission of Wordsworth's sentimentality and a telling encap- sulation of Clare's distinctive observation of the desire of all animals (and some humans) 'to be secure in a secluded spot'. The thorny issue of anthropomorphism is duly tangled with, and Oerlemens is surely right to point out that both the concept of anthropomorphism and its prohibition are inherent feature of anthropocentrism: the chances are there is no way out of that particular ecocritical thicket. Overall, there is much to appreciate here as well as a certain amount to irritate, but that is no harm - Oerlemans is right in desiring a harder edge to ecocriticism and such edges will tend to irritate. My only regret applies to ecocriticism in general, as much as to this book, which is the loss of one of feminism's early mantras - that of different, but equal. It is proving difficult indeed to maintain that ideal hierarchies will creep in: the prevalence of Wordsworth throughout this book and the initial assertion of the Romantics' originary status are evidence of this, as is the habit of having his literary figures emerge as heroes of particular chapters and the final, almost predictable, move to Thoreau's Walden. UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL GILLIAN RUDD Poetic Castles in Spain: British Romanticism and Figurations of Iberia. By DIEGO SAGLIA. (Internationale Forschungen zur Allgemeinen und Vergleichenden Literatur- wissenschaft) Amsterdam and Atlanta, GA: Rodopi. 2000. 355 pp. ?55; $52. ISBN: 90-420-0428-2. The book under review is not only a study of the poetic figurations of Iberia in British romantic writings, as the title suggests, but also a full compendium of Anglo-Spanish relationships between the i8ios and the I820s, both literary and political, in that the latter determine the nature of the creation and the reception of 258 Reviews</page><page sequence="2">YES, 34, 2004 259 English literature with Spanish motifs in the United Kingdom. Although the title of Diego Saglia's book refers to both Spain and Iberia, it must also be said that the work is centred on the influence of Spanish culture and history upon the English imagination, as Saglia leaves aside the Portuguese impact (p. I8). The main aim of the book, as the author consistently puts it, is 'to trace the contours of the Spanish "imaginary" in British Romanticism and, in so doing, indi- viduate a "cultural geography" of Romantic Spain as a space of war involving not only France and Britain or the Spanish and Moorish armies, but also ideological conflicts between public and private, republicanism, nationalism, and imperialism, or competing models of masculinity and femininity' (p. 12). This vast piece of research is divided into three chapters preceded by an illuminating introductory section. In it the author explains that he follows a Foucauldian and new-historicist perspective, in which the language of power shows the complex relations established between Romantic Spain and how it is perceived in different, even contradictory ways, through the object decade of the study. Saglia also follows Gerard Genette in Palimpsestes (I982) in his consideration of Spain as a text, a palimpsest, and a dis- course (p. I3). This approach is particularly useful to the analysis and description of 'the structure of the exotically other place' (p. 14). Chapter i is constructed around the conception of war in the period and the myths of the nation created before, during, and after the Peninsular War (I8II1-I4) in texts such as Felicia Hemans's The Domestic Affections and England and Spain, Robert Southey's Roderick, Walter Savage Landor's Count Julian, Sir Walter Scott's The Vision of Don Roderick, and Lord Byron's Childe Harold, I. The second chapter explores the modes of subjectivity and offers an analysis of patriots, heroines, and dons in some of the above-mentioned texts, and in others, such as Mary Leman Grimstone's Zayda, Byron's Don Juan, Barry Conwall's Diego de Montilla. Chapter 3 covers the myth of orientalism in Spain, as the epitome of cross-cultural relationships with the Muslim world throughout the centuries, and the contradictory relations established then and actualized in the Romantic period by means of Spanish, medieval, Moorish literature topics. Some of the texts revised in this chapter are Lord Porchester's The Moor, George Croly's Sebastian, and Hemans's The Abencerrage. The work is fully informative, as it not only covers the three main literary genres, but also includes Spanish references in periodical publications, travel books, and also letters to and by different authors and members of literary circles. All this infor- mation is conveniently supplied in footnotes that complete the data offered in the text. There is also an exhaustive, comprehensive bibliography, which includes both primary and secondary sources, mainly of English origin, but with some outstanding Spanish sources, too. Such a quantity of relevant information and analysis as that contained in this book, and in a much-neglected field of study, deserves a more detailed index.
