Cicero's presentation of Platonic passages and con- cepts is shown to be fairly accurate; it is therefore con- cluded that it is possible to accept as evidence his de- scriptions and interpretations of other philosophers. CPh 35 (1940) 143-53 (W. Wallace) MARY JOHNSTON. S.V.B.E. Against Laid- law's statement (CPh 34 [1939] 251-2) that "Even Cicero did not write often to a governor in his prov- ince," much evidence is produced that he frequently did. CPh 35 (1940) 304 (W. Wallace) Herodotus. IVAN MA. LINFORTH. Greek and Egyptian Gods (Herodotus 11.50 and 52). It is argued that Lat- timore's over-literal interpretation of these passages (CPh 34 [1939] 357-65) is impossible. CPh 35 (1940) 300-1 (W. Wallace) Ioannes Secundus. HARRY E. WEDECK. A Mediaeva! Gafftllus: Ioannes Secundus. loannes Secundus, Dutch neo-Latin poet of the sixteenth century, was a gifte(d imitator of Catullus. His mastery of the Catullan theme and mood, vocabulary and style, is shown clearly in the Basia, the Amores, and the Epithalamium. PhQ 19 (1940) 400-4 (P. F. Jones) Juvenal. BERTIL AXELSON. A Problem of Genuine- ness in Juvenal. Thirty-four lines, inserted after Juv- enal 6.365 in one MS and accepted as genuine by modern editors, are discussed on grounds of metrics, style, con- text, and external considerations. They are concluded to be an interpolation, the work of an ancient poetaster, wAho expanded 6.346-8 to piece out twenty-nine lines of his own composition. APArMA1 41-55 (Salyer) Livy. MIosEs HADAS. Livy as Scripture. Livy's conception of the Romans as a chosen race under divine protection is comparable to the portrayal of Israel in the Old Testament, and is quite foreign to the Greek his- torians.

"The wider structure of the poem is thus philosophic, but the inner development is pictorial." MIany difficult passages in the poem may be understood in terms of this visual method of thought. AJPh 61 (1940) 278-91 (De Lacy) Ovid. JOSEPH E. FONTENROSE. Apollo and the Sun- God in Ovid. In Ovid's poems Apollo and the Sun-God are distinct, for the most part, in regard to myths, attri- butes, and epithets. AJPh 61 (1940) 429-44 (De Lacy) Vitruvius. AXEL BOETHIUS. Vitruvius and the Romant Architecture of his Age. Vitruvius based his De Architectura on the precepts of his teachers, the writings of Hellenistic architects, and his own experi- ence. "A study of the development of Roman technique and of what Vitruvius says about it, corroborates the dating 25-23 B.C. . . . His contribution . . . is mostly that of a conservative critic of the new generation with its rush, its reckless competition, its unsafe and treach- erous estimates, its convenient and swift but in his opinion often unreliable technique of building.' Ill. APArMA 114-43 (Salyer) PHILOSOPHY. RELIGION. SCIENCE ARBMAN, ERNST. Mythic and Religious Thought. In the myth anthropomorphic gods act partly through nat- ural means; in religion divine power is purely super- natural. Examples are drawn from Hebrew, Nordic, and Greek literature. APArMA 20-40 (Salyer) EPIGRAPHY. NUMISMATICS. PALAEOGRAPHY BLATT, FRANZ. Un nouveau texte d'une apologie anonyme chretienne. A Vatican MS furnishes a better text than the one presented in Migne, Patrologie latine 10.733-50, of a work wrongly attributed to Hilary of Poitiers and to Tiberianus Baeticus. The new text is here given, collated with the former edition and with a Florentine fragment. APArMA 67-95 (Salyer) Bi,INKENBERG, CHR. Reglemnents de sacrifices rhodiecns. Texts of eleven stele inscriptions from Rhodes, three hitherto unpublished, are givren with commentary. Dat- ing from 400 B.C. to the beginning of the first century B.C., they commemorate sacrifices of small animals to various divinities. Ill. APAFMA 96-113 (Salyer) RAUBITSCHMK, ANTON E. A New Fragment of A.T.L., D S. Notes on reconstruction and date of two docu- ments of the Athenian tribute lists. AJPh 61 (1940) 475-9 (De Lacy) SCHOUTZ, OSCAR. Eini neuer orphischer Papyrustext. A ritual oath in a fragmentary papyrus text of the first century Ak.D., published by Bartoletti in Annali della R. Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa (Lettere, Storia e Filosofia) 6 (1937) 143-52, is identified as Orphic. A similar oath is found in PSI 10.1162, a papyrus of the third century, also published by Bartoletti. The texts, wvhich supplement each other, are republished here with suggested emendations.

Tlhree inscriptions (IG 22, 71+38, 174, 73) are assigned to the fifth century instead of the fourth. New restorations are made of IG 22, 71+38 and 73. AJPh 61 (1940) 345-57 (De Lacy) YoUTIE, H. C. P.

The Metropolitan 1Iuseum of Art acquired in 1938 from the Committee for the Excavation of Antioch and Its Vicin- ity a mosaic pavement (ill.) from a villa at Daphne: A square central panel containing a personification of Spring, garlanded with flowers around the head and over the shoulder, within a wide geometric border of squares and lozenges. BMIM 35 (1940) 244-7 (J. J.) AMANDRY, PIERRE. Rapport preliniinaire sur les statues chryselephantines de Delphes. The recent exca- vation of two ditches in the vicinity of the Portico of the Athenians at Delphi has brought to light a con- glomeration of consecrated objects, including chrys- elephantine statues. The latter are the work of Ionian artists who receiv-ed their inspiration from the Oriental sources and reintroduced into Greece proper the tech- nique that had been forgotten after the Mycenaean epoch. The nude parts of the statues were in ivory, the ornaments in gold, and the clothing in gilded metal. Illustrated. BCH 63 (1939) 86-119 (Krauss) ANDREN, ARVID. Una testa fittile etrusca del V secolo a. C. A hand-modeled terracotta head of a young wo- man from Veii, dated 430-420 B.C., presents archaic characteristics in coiffure, while the features belong to a pre-classic severe style. Taken with a series of Etruscan pieces inspired by fifth century Greek sculpture, it dis- credits the theory that Etruscan art passed, without gradual development, from the archaic period to the fourth century. Ill. APAFMA 1-19 (Salyer) DOWNEY, GLANVILLE. Representationts of Abstract Ideas in tlhe Anitioch Mosaics. Calls attention to the im- portance of these mosaics in the history of ideas and provides bibliography. JHIl 1 (1940) 112-3 (Pratt) RICHTER, GISELA MA. A. A Set of Etruscan Jezelry. Twelve pieces of Etruscan gold jewelry, necklace, two disk(-carring?)s, five rings, three fibulas and a pin (all ill.), were discovered in a large tomb at Vulci about 1832. The iMetropolitan MXluseum of Art acquired the set in 1940. BMMA 35 (1940) 223-6 (J. J.) ROGER, JACQUES. Le M1onumnenit anx liont d'Amphipolis. A detailed descriptive account of the fragments of a somewhat elaborate sepulchral monument that was located near the ancient site of the Macedonian towIn Amphipolis. The evidence of reconstruction suggests that this memorial was the private tomb of some notable individual rather than a public monument commemorat- ing those who died in a great battle. The architectural outlines show the influence of Asia Minor and, in par- ticular, of the Mausoleum. The statue of the lion which surmounted this structure was restored in 1937 and placed on a simple modern pedestal. Illustrated.
