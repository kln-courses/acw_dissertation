Abel Univ. of Pennsylvania Hume Adams and David Graham Univ. of Glasgow CEREBRAL CONTUSIONS have long been regarded as a hallmark of mechanically induced damage to the brain. Current hypotheses as to the precise mechanism of injury are based either on human pathological studies where the magnitude and direction of input are not measured or on animal studies involving impact to the skull (1, 2, 3).* In order to provide an additional viewpoint to this problem, we have analyzed frontal and temporal contusions which result from a non- impact, controlled sagittal plane angular acceleration. Conclusions from this analysis suggest that by this injury mechanism *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. frontal contusions occur at lower acceleration levels than do temporal contusions. METHODS Thirty rhesus monkeys were subjected to a single acceleration impulse and later sacrificed for detailed neuropathological examination. The specific details of the acceleration apparatus have been reported previously and will be reviewed only briefly (4). The head of the Macaque monkey was placed into an individually molded thermoplastic helmet which was in turn bolted to a linkage system attached to the thrust column of a 6 inch Hyge pneumatic actuator. The six inch axial displacement of the thrust column __________________________ ABSTRACT - Frontal and temporal lobe contusions that were caused by a single sagittal plane angular acceleration impulse were analyzed. At neuropathological exam the depth, extent, and location of contusions were mapped and described according to a classification previously developed for human use. Of 30 rhesus monkeys subjected to a single angular acceleration impulse, 13 had no frontal or temporal contusion (Group 1) , 8 had only frontal contu- sion (Group 2) and 9 had temporal contusions (Group 3) . Correlation with angular accelera- tion, tangential acceleration and tangential force showed that the three groups were statistically different. The mean peak positive tangential force for Groups 1-3 was 541, 659, and 766 newtons respectively (p&lt;0.10). This suggested that as mechanical input increased, frontal contusions occur before temporal contusions and that the threshold for frontal contusion is less than that for temporal contusion. If this relationship is true, one would predict that if there is sufficient input to cause a temporal contusion then a frontal contusion should also be present. In fact, in Group 3, 8 of the 9 animals with temporal contusion also had frontal contusion. Thus only once did a temporal contusion occur in the absence of frontal contusion. Furthermore, the frontal contusions in Group 3 were statistically more extensive than either the frontal contusion of Group 2 or than the temporal contusions of Group 3. These data support the concept that in angular acceleration the threshold for frontal contusions is less than the threshold for temporal contusions. The reasons why this is so could be related either to differences in the mechanical properties of the tissues or to regional differences of the mechanical input. Since the authors feel that the data best support the hypothesis that these contusions result from deceleration contact forces, we favor the latter explanation. 3503 0096-7 36X/80/8804-3503$02.50 Copyright © 1980 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">3504 T. A. GENNARELLI, ET AL. was converted into a rotation of the head by the linkage system. This system was designed so that the supine animal's head began in an extended position (-26°) and after acceleration through an angular displacement of 60° was brought to rest in a slightly flexed position (+34°). Tan- gential acceleration was measured using Endevco piezo-electric accelerometers which were mounted on the head table. After filtering, the acceler- ation-time history characteristic of the system was an approximate sine wave. Exploration of peak positive angular accelerations from 1.8 X 104 rad/sec2 to 1.2 x 105 rad/sec2 was done encompassing total pulse durations between 6 and 11 milliseconds. For purposes of this report only the peak positive accelerations are reported. The location of the center of mass of the brain was approximated by the site of the pineal gland which was estimated from anatomical landmarks. Since the focus of this investigation was rotational effects, only tangential accelerations were computed. Hence, reported acceleration values cannot properly be compared with total acceleration based indices such as the HIC or G.S.I. Numerous physiological measurements were made after the acceleration impulse was delivered and the animal was observed in the post acceler- ation period. Two basic categories of physio- logical responses were obtained, one in which rather prompt death ensued secondary to massive subdural hematomas. These animals were perfusion fixed within hours of the acceleration. The second group were animals who survived the acceleration impulse either with or without cerebral concussions. These animals were allowed to survive for one week and then were electively sacrificed and perfusion fixed. Perfusion fixation was done in the manner of Brierly (5) under phencycladine and nitrous oxide anesthesia, a thoracotomy was performed and left ventricular perfusion done at normoten- sive levels. Saline followed by f ormalin-acid- methanol (FAM) perfusion was done and the head removed. The head was placed into FAM for 24 hours after which the brain was removed, examined in a gross state, photographed and suspended in FAM for 24 hours. The brain was then placed in 70% methanol and subsequently mailed to the University of Glasgow. There the specimens were photographed, the brain sectioned and embedded in parafin and celloidin. Macroscopic contusions were described both in the fresh, post-mortem state and also independently by the neuropathologists. All contusions were verified histologically by light microscopy. The size, extent and depth of all contusions was recorded photographically and transferred to standard line drawings. The depth and extent of each contusion was described by a system previously developed by the authors (H.A., D.G.). This classification of contusion was used originally to describe contusions in human brains but is perfectly applicable to the monkey brain. See Table 1. Contusional depth is divided into three categories depending on the penetrance of the contusion into the white matter. The contusion is scored with a depth of one if it is confined to the cortical gray matter layer only. If the contusion penetrates the entire thickness of the cortical gray matter but does not extend into the white matter it is classified grade 2. A grade 3 contusion depth is one in which the contusion penetrates into the white matter. A similar classification is used for the extent of the contusion. A small contusion confined to the apex of one gyrus is graded with the score one. A larger contusion is scored two if two or more adjacent gyri are involved with the same contusion, while a score of three indicates more than one brain surface is contused. RESULTS Using the contusion scoring system des- cribed above contusions were classified in 30 Macaque monkeys subjected to a single accelera- tion impulse. This report deals with 3 groups of animals, nine which had temporal contusions (Group 3) , eight with frontal contusions only (Group 2), and thirteen which had neither frontal nor temporal contusion (Group 1) . Temporal and frontal contusions were the most frequent and the largest of the contusions seen in the animals. These comprised 65% of all contusions seen, the remainder of which were tiny and scattered in the parieto-occipital and cere- bellar regions. These latter contusions probably represent a failure of our energy dissipation system and reflect some degree of point loading of the skull occipitally. In some cases early in the series skull fractures were present overlying these small contusions and because of their small size and imprecise location, these will not be considered further. The geometry of the frontal and temporal lobes in the Macaque monkey is quite similar to that in the human. Both lobes have an inferior surface which is broad and lies on the floor of the anterior and middle cranial fossa respectively. Additionally both lobes have an anterior surface which in the case of the frontal lobe forms an acute angle with the inferior surface due to the small bulk of the frontal tip. This is a slight geometrical difference from the human in which case, the tip of the frontal lobe is less of an acute angle. Thus this anterior surface is really anterodorsal in the monkey. The anterior sur- face of the temporal lobe, on the other hand, does face anteriorly and forms almost a right angle with the inferior surface of the temporal lobe. The location of the frontal and of the temporal contusions was quite uniform in ani- mals in which they appeared. Frontal contusions occupied the inferior or antero-dorsal surfaces of one or both frontal lobes at the absolute frontal pole (Fig. 1). As the extent of the frontal contusions increased they wrapped around the frontal tip to its anterior surface</page><page sequence="3">ANGULAR ACCELERATION 3505 TABLE 1 CONTUSION CLASSIFICATION Depth 1 Confined to grey matter of cortex 2 Extends to grey-white junction 3 Extends into white matter Extent 1 Confined to apex of one gyrus 2 Two adjacent gyri involved 3 Involves more than one brain surface before extending posteriorly along the gyrus rectus. The temporal contusions occurred on the inferior surface of the temporal pole but often appeared on the anterior surface of the temporal tip (Fig. 2). Our initial analysis showed us that there was a good correlation between injury severity and the depth and extent of contusions. Using the experimental trauma severity (ETS) scale which had been previously reported (4) we noted that 50% of non-concussed animals (ETS 1 2) had contusions whereas 78% of mildly concussed animals (ETS 3) and 90% of severely concussed (ETS 4) or fatally injured animals (ETS 5) had contusions. The ETS grade is approximately the same as the AIS- 7 9 number as modified for animal use. The average number of contusions per animal increased as trauma severity increased and the extent of contusions also increased. Curiously the depth of contusions increased only through ETS 4 while in ETS 5 there was an apparent decrease in the depth of contusion. This can be related to the marked difference in survival time of the two groups. ETS 4 animals survived for a week and had deeper contusions than ETS 5 animals which survived for an average of 3 hours. It is hypothesized that the extent but not the depth of contusions is principally determined by the traumatic event. It appears that contusions can become deeper with time, probably by ischemic involvement of penetrating blood vessels. Tables 2, 3, and 4 show the relationship of the presence of temporal, frontal or no contusion with the measures of mechanical variables. Fig. 3 shows an animal in Group 3. The three groups are statistically different. Using a Student t test the biggest differences are as follows: Group 2 and Group 3 are statis- tically different at the P&lt;. 05, &lt;0.025 and &lt;0.10 for angular acceleration, tangential acceleration and tangential force respectively (Figs. 4, 5, 6). Groups 1 and 2 are only separable statis- tically on the basis of peak tangential force and this is a p&lt;0.1 level. Thus, the presence of a temporal contusion is related to higher mechanical input and is best correlated with Fig. 1 - Frontal view of brain with frontal contusions only</page><page sequence="4">3506 T.

Tables 2, 3, and 4 also demonstrate the semi-quantitative depth and extent measures in each group. As the acceleration and force increase from Group 2 to Group 3 the frontal contusions in each group do not increase in depth but do increase in extent considerably. When they appear in Group 3 the temporal contusions are considerably deeper than the frontal contusions either of Group 3 or of Group 2. The extent of these contusions, however, is identical to the extent of the frontal contusions in Group 2. From a statistical point of view, the p value is less than 0.05 when comparing the depth of temporal and frontal contusions within Group 3. The depth of frontal contusion is not statistically different from Groups 2 and 3. MECHANICAL MODEL The observed contusions are naturally associated with impact of the affected tissue upon the adjacent portion of the skull. It is possible to construct a highly simplified model of the average or center of mass motion of the brain relative to the skull for the acceleration history which was employed in these experiments and to obtain a reasonable qualitative picture of the resultant gross motion of the brain. If the potential for the creation of surface contusions is related to the displacement of the brain relative to the skull, then some insight into the reasons for the difference between the threshold for occurrence of frontal and temporal lobe con- tusions may be gained. In this model, the brain is viewed as being elastically coupled to the skull through the dura and other connecting tissues. As a result for the study of the center of mass (c.m.) motion of the brain itself, a model consisting of a lumped mass with elastic connections to a rigid surrounding shell may be employed (Fig. 7). Displacements of' the c.m. relative to the skull are measured in the body-fixed (x, y) axis system. Motions of the lumped mass then correspond to averages of the displacement field induced by accelera- tions of the supporting shell and attached reference frame. PROPERTIES OF THE INPUT In these experiments the angular accelera- tion was roughly sinusoidal and the total angular travel was the same in all cases: 0max - 60°. As a consequence, as the value of peak acceleration increased, the time duration of the pulse decreased. This fact is of significance when examining any mechanical</page><page sequence="8">3510 T. A. GENNARELLI, ET AL. models since changes in the amplitude of the input also induce changes in the fundamental frequency of the input. Hence, responses cannot be expected to vary linearly with input amplitude, but rather changes in the apparent "tuning11 must be accounted for simultaneously.

Since the brain is elongated in the tangential direction and there is considerably greater tethering in the radial direction by the brain stem and spinal cord, the value assigned to the stiffness or natural frequency for radial motion was kept at twice the corresponding value for the tangential direction. Reports in Refs. 6 and 7 suggest that the natural frequency for gross motion of the brain tangentially (anterior- posterior displacement) is in the range of 10 - 100 hz, and this range of values was used in the analytical model. Because the radial motion is forced by the square of the angular velocity while the tangential motion is driven by the angular acceleration itself, the tangential displacement is always larger than the radial displacement. Fig. 8 shows the normalized displacements for one set of assumed frequencies as peak angular acceleration varies. The trajectory of the c.m. in the rotating reference frame is shown for this case in Fig. 9 for three different values of peak acceleration. The features of the displacement trajec- tories are similar for other values of 0)^, 0) and show uniformly that tangential motions are always larger than radial motions. From the location of the contusions observed in the experimental series, it is reasonable to suggest that the frontal lobe contusions result from the impact of the brain moving tangentially as the skull is brought to rest. The lenticular leading edge of the frontal lobe moves forward and slightly downward impacting upon the adjacent skull. The contact forces associated with that collision are to the first order likely to be proportional to the mean tangential displacement of the c.m. at the end of the acceleration pulse. The anterior facing surface of the temporal lobe will be similarly affected. On the other hand, the observed temporal contusions which appear on the downward facing surface may be considered to be related to the gross radial motion of the brain, and the resulting collision as the brain moves back to its equilibrium position is governed by the peak radial displacement attained at the end of the pulse. Thus if the force thresholds for con- tusion of the tissue in the two major regions are comparable, it becomes clear that the acceleration threshold for frontal contusion will always be lower than that for temporal contusions and that temporal contusions will not appear in the absence of frontal contusions as has been observed. DISCUSSION As with many experimental animal models of head injury, the pecularities of the experimental system can to a large degree dictate the results. In relating our results to other studies of contusions it must be understood that we have gone to great lengths to minimize the contact phenomena associated with impact. In so doing we have decreased the effect that skull bending, shock wave propagation, skull fracture and other local contact forces have on the brain.</page><page sequence="10">3512 T. A.

It is the intention of our head injury apparatus that a non-impact angular acceleration be delivered to the head and that the kinematics be rigidly controlled. For example, in our situation, encasing the animal's head in the helmet serves two purposes, first to diffuse the acceleration load which is delivered occipitally and secondly to assure that the head moves only in the prescribed fashion programmed for it by the accelerating device. The degree to which the apparatus is successful in achieving these goals is unknown; however, the low incidence of skull fracture despite high levels of input suggests that in fact the input is distributed widely over the skull. Only in several instances was a small linear occipital fracture noted. Our results also are dependent on the double impulse provided to the brain by the approximate sine wave acceleration-time history. Thus, except for those contact forces occipitally, there is no coup or contra-coup area. A further peculiarity of our particular system is the ability to vary the radius of rotation. These experiments have explored relatively large radii and as a consequence the movement contains a large component of translational acceleration. These factors notwithstanding, it appears that as mechanical input increases, frontal contusions occur before temporal contusions and that the threshold for frontal contusion is less than that for temporal contusion. If this relationship is true, three critical predictions can be made which must be examined. First, if this hypothesis is correct then frontal contusions should occur in isolation from temporal contusions. This is clearly the case in that Group 2 exists and on the basis of tangential acceleration, angular acceleration and tangential force (in decreasing order of importance) . Group 2 is statistically different from Group 3 in which temporal contusions are present. The second critical prediction is that if there is sufficient input to cause a temporal contusion, then a frontal contusion must also be present. In fact, in Group 3, 8 of 9 animals with temporal contusion also had frontal contusion. Thus only once did a temporal contusion occur in the absence of frontal contusion. The third prediction is that if contusions worsen as mechanical input increases, then frontal contusions should be worse than temporal contusions. In Group 3 where both frontal and temporal contusions are present, the frontal contusions are statis- tically more extensive than either the frontal contusions of Group 2 or the temporal contusions of Group 3. These data support the concept that the mechanical threshold for frontal contusion is less than the threshold for temporal contusion. SUMMARY The extent and depth of cerebral contusions which result from a single non- impact, controlled sagittal plane angular acceleration were analyzed. A simple mathematical model of the experimental situation was exercised and the following conclusions were drawn:</page><page sequence="12">3514 T. A. GENNARELLI, ET AL. 1. The number, depth and surface extent of cerebral contusions increases as mechanical input to the head increases. 2. It appears that the extent of contusions is primarily determined by the immediate traumatic event but that the depth of the contusion can increase with time. This is postulated to be due to a progressive ischemic involvement of the penetrating blood vessels which cause infarction necrosis beneath the contused surface lesion. 3. As mechanical input increases, frontal lobe contusions occur before temporal contusions. 4. The mechanical threshold for frontal lobe contusion is less than that for temporal lobe contusion. 5. Temporal lobe contusions occur almost exclusively in conjunction with frontal lobe contusions as a result of this sagittal plane angular acceleration. The data and conclusions as well as the results of the mathematical model suggest that contusions in the frontal and temporal lobes are best explained by the hypothesis that these contusions result from deceleration contact forces. In the case of the frontal lobes, the tangential component and in the case of the inferior temporal lobe, the radial component of the brain movement . appear to be the injurious factors.
