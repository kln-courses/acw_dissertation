<plain_text><page sequence="1">FRANZ RADEMACHER, Die Regina Angelorum in der Kunst des friihen Mittelalters (Die Kunstdenkmdler des Rheinlandes, xvii), Diisseldorf, Schwann, 1972. Pp. 132; 117 black-and-white ills. DM. 36. Rademacher's book serves two purposes. It is a detailed study of the Oberpleis Altar, an interesting and little known example of Rhenish sculpture from the third quarter of the twelfth century. At the same time it is a detailed and thorough survey of the icono- graphic theme that Rademacher believes the Oberpleis Altar in its original state presented: the Virgin between Angels. Rade- macher has collected a vast amount of material ranging from the fourth to the thirteenth centuries. He organizes it in three large chapters, one dealing with the Early Christian period, one with the West between 700 and I300, and one with the East during the same period. Within each chapter he proceeds according to artistic media, dealing with ivories, stone sculpture, frescoes, and mosaics. This breakdown helps the student who wishes to trace a given monument, but is somewhat frustrating to a reader who is interested in the subject as a whole. Rademacher touches the literary and dogmatic background of his theme only lightly. He points to New Testament Apocrypha with their stories of angels serving the young Mary during her stay in the temple. He also cites the frequent use of such poetic sur- names for the Virgin as Regina, Domina, Patrona, or Imperatrix Angelorum. No mention is made, however, of the Christological</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 599 implications of the image. Yet these must have been felt strongly, especially in times of dogmatic struggle. In leafing through the reproductions in Rademacher's book, one becomes immediately aware that more than ninety percent of the material collected shows not only the Virgin but her child as well. One might, there- fore, very well argue that it is not so much to the Mother but to the Son that the angels proffer such symbols of victory and universal rule as the globe and the wreath. A Christological emphasis is especially clear in the Adria relief (fig. I I), where the Virgin, like the angels, raises her hands in adoration of the Divine Child on her lap. Generally, however, she holds him with a firm and protective grasp while the angels recede, approach, or stand in awe. One could hardly think of a pictorial statement that would represent more adequately both the divine and the human natures of Christ.' In some instances Christ's double nature is also carefully stressed. This is the case for instance in the Sinai icon (fig. I6). While the Child reclines on his Mother's lap the hand of his divine Father appears above, releasing a flux of light. In this case the angels direct their gaze toward the hand of God and not toward Mother and Child. In the West patrons and artists may have been less alert to the Christological implications of the image. This would explain why the Arian Theoderic thought nothing of having a mosaic of the Theotokos between angels in his palace church. In addition the Western image of the Maria Regina, which shows the Virgin dressed as an Augusta and later as a queen, subtly shifts the focus from the Child to the Mother, and replaces the Christological message of the image by a courtly atmosphere in which Mary seems to take first place. There are some Western images, however, whose patrons seem to have been eager to stress the Christological point. In the Rambona Diptych (fig. 23), instead of the usual anthropomorphic angels, fiery cherubim hovering above their wheels appear at the sides of Mary and the Child. These cherubs, described by Ezekiel and later by the author of the Apocalypse, identify the child on Mary's lap as both the pre-existent Logos and the future Judge. Another Western representation with Christological emphasis is a mosaic of Leo III in Santi Nereo ed Achilleo in Rome, not mentioned by Rade- macher. Here we find the Regina Angelorum side by side with representations of the Transfiguration and Annunciation. This can best be understood, I think, as a belated anti-adoptionist statement. Most of the representations collected by Rademacher are devoid of:action. Some, however, introduce the Regina Angelorum into the context of narrative scenes. The Virgin without Child, her hands lifted in prayer, often appears in scenes of the Ascension or in rep- resentations of Mary's sojourn in Heaven. The Virgin with the Child on her lap is sometimes connected with an Adoration of the Magi. Rademacher's survey offers five examples for this combina- tion, the mosaic in San Apollinare Nuovo (fig. 19), the apse fresco from San Juan de Tred6s, LUrida (fig. 8o), a Catalan Antependium in Barcelona (fig. Io9), the tympanum of the "Golden Gate" of Freiberg (fig. 71), and finally, the relief in Oberpleis, the subject of Rademacher's book, which surely belongs in this group as well, at least in its present state. Having lost its original setting, it consists today of three stone slabs. The center one shows the Virgin seated frontally with the Child on her lap. On the slab to her right stand three angels; three kings approach from the left. Rademacher believes that the mixed iconography of the Oberpleis altarpiece is the outcome of two distinct phases in the making of the relief. This assumption is strengthened by the fact that the relief as it stands today is clearly the work of different hands. But, as Rademacher 1 A possible textual source for the image is Hebrews I and 2, where Christ's divinity is asserted by comparing him to the angels. They are mere "ministrant spirits" (Hebr. I:I4); not so Christ. Psalm 97:7 is one of the Old Testament texts quoted: "Again, when He brings His first- born into the world, He says, 'let all the Angels pay him homage' " (Hebr. 1:6). In Cyril of Alexandria's anti-Nestorian interpretation this passage becomes part of the Acts of the Council of Ephesus (E. Schwartz, Acta conciliorum oecumenicorum, I, 3, Berlin-Leipzig, 1929, p Iff.), which bestowed the title of Theotokos on the Virgin and which is also the terminus post quem for the image studied by Rademacher. says himself, both artists probably belonged to the same school and perhaps even to the same workshop. He therefore thinks that the reworking must have taken place within a few years after the relief was first completed, which means shortly after I 15o-I I6o. This permits Rademacher to connect the reworking of the relief with the date I 164, the year in which the relics of the three kings were brought to Cologne. At this point, whoever was responsible for the iconography of the Oberpleis relief decided, according to Rade- macher, to introduce the figures of the three kings into the recently finished representation of the Virgin between angels. As a result three of the original six angels were discarded and replaced by the three kings. Rademacher's hypothesis offers an elegant explanation for both the hybrid iconography and the change of hands in the monument. Yet some doubts remain. As the doors of Sankt Maria im Kapitol show, the story of the three Magi aroused interest in Cologne before the translation of their relics into the city, and the mixed iconography of the relief, although relatively rare, was, as we have seen, not altogether unique. Was not the juxtaposition of angels and kings an apt way to reveal the Child as ruler of both worlds, heavenly and terrestrial ? If such an iconography made sense after I 164, it is hard to see why it shouldn't have done so a few years earlier as well. Moreover, the stylistic issues are not entirely clear. I think that Rademacher is right in stressing the differences between the groups of angels and kings, but to which group, if indeed to either, does the Virgin belong ? Her garment lacks the variation between taut surfaces and strands of delicate curvilinear folds that is characteristic for the angels. The folds over the Child's left leg are not rounded, but angular, like those in the frock of the last king. And is not the Child's opened hand and sidewise glance a fitting gesture of welcome for the three Magi ? The scene on the Oberpleis relief is certainly a hybrid one, and Rademacher is right to stress this fact. But whether its complexity is the result of imaginative planning before the work was started, or while it was going on, or after it had been finished for the first time, cannot be known. The iconography of the altarpiece could in each case be understood as a combination of two iconographic themes, that of the Regina Angelorum and that of the Adoration of the Magi. Since Rademacher is able to show that the theme of the Regina Angelorum was frequently used in connection with altars, he is also able to suggest that the present use of the relief as a retable may have been its original one as well. The particular value of this study lies, however, in its iconographic chapters. They are thorough, liberally illustrated, and relatively free from mistakes. The book, however, contains one error which uncorrected might give rise to an art-historical legend. On page 34 Rademacher speaks of a fresco of John VII on the palimpsest wall of Santa Maria Antiqua, representing a Virgin between angels. No such fresco to my knowledge ever existed.
