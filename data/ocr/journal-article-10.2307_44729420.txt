Forest Federal Aviation Administration ABSTRACT The results of dynamic seat testing at four different test facilities with different test devices are presented. An acceleration-type sled, two deceleration-type sleds, and a drop tower were used in this evaluation. Repeatability between test facilities is discussed. Comparisons of the results obtained from the four test facilities, including pulse shapes, acceleration levels, measured injury crite- ria, and structural loads, are made. The findings of this program address the question of whether or not different test facilities and test devices produce comparable test and certification results. INTRODUCTION The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received a number of inquiries regarding the use of various commer- cial test facilities that might be used for showing compli- ance with the seat dynamic performance standards defined in sections .562 of 14 CFR Parts 23, 25, 27, and 29. [1] Those facilities use several different test devices to develop the required test pulse. Users of those facilities question whether different test facilities and test devices produce comparable test and certification results. In an attempt to answer that question, the FAA and an aircraft seat manufacturer defined and participated in a cooperative seat test program with four different test facil- ities. The seat manufacturer provided the test specimens and assisted in the preparation and set-up of the various tests. After conducting a series of evaluation tests at the differ- ent test facilities, comparisons of the acquired data were made to determine if the results were consistent. TEST FACILITY DESCRIPTIONS Four test facilities were involved in this program. They represent three distinct types of test devices used (i.e., an acceleration-type sled, two deceleration-type sleds, and a drop tower) to develop dynamic test pulses. CIVIL AEROMEDICAL INSTITUTE; OKLAHOMA CITY, OK -The FAA's Civil Aeromedicai Institute, CAMI, was involved in the development of the seat dynamic test standards. CAMI uses a horizontal decelerator test sled to simulate the impact condition. The test platform is pro- pelled by its attachment to a heavy weight, which is dropped from a pre-determined height onto a bed of sand. Drawing and bending steel wires through a fixed roller decelerator assembly achieve the desired pulse shape. Various test pulses are obtained by varying the number and layout of the steel wires. MGA RESEARCH CORPORATION; BURLINGTON, Wl - MGA has extensive experience in automobile crash test- ing. MGA uses a HYGE sled to simulate an impact by accelerating a test carriage, which is initially at rest. The accelerating force is obtained by applying high-pressure air against a piston attached to a thrust column. This col- umn forces the carriage rearward; the specific pulse is obtained by adjusting a metering pin and orifice, which controls the flow of air against the piston. SIMULA, INC.; PHOENIX, AZ- The Simula drop tower test facility has been used extensively in the qualification of military seat products. A cage containing the test arti- cle is dropped from a pre-determined height and gravity is used to obtain the desired impact velocity. The desired pulse is obtained from the crushable honeycomb material on which the cage assembly falls. The size and shape of the honeycomb material can be changed to vary the resultant pulse severity and shape. (Since this test pro- gram, Simula has added a horizontal impact test sled.) THE WICHITA STATE UNIVERSITY, WICHITA, KS - At the time of this test program, Wichita State University (TWSU) was a new test facility that was involved in the certification of civil aircraft seats. TWSU utilizes a hori- zontal decelerator test sled, similar to CAMI's. A pneu- matic device propels the test platform. The pulse shape is achieved by drawing and bending steel straps through a roller cage assembly. Different pulses can be obtained by changing the dimensions of the steel straps. 352</page><page sequence="2">TEST CONDITIONS A total of four tests were conducted at each of the partici- pating test labs; two tests each were conducted in the horizontal with yaw and the combined vertical/horizontal directions as depicted in Figure 1 . __ J jēgt ι Test 2 Illustration - - - - - forward3 facing β Yaw right or left seat I -i Q--Cxr^m - Inertial load J shown by arrow ^--1-30 Min V rrVs(ft/sec 10.67 (35) 13.41 (44) Max sec 0.080 0.090 Min G 14 16 Deform floor Degrees roll 0 10 Degrees pitch 0 1 0 -ι- χ ι · ι χ 0 tr ' time -ι- Test χ pulse ι simulating · ι χ Q ' j aircraft floor deceleration Q 'T / time history I / deceleration X ' / tf = rise time ▼ X / V = Impact velocity G '/ G = Measured decelerarion on sled or test fixture Figure 1 . Seat/Restraint System Dynamic Tests [2] The tests in the horizontal direction were conducted with the anthropomorphic test device (ATD)-occupied seating system in its nominal position, with the vertical plane of the seat yawed 10 degrees counterclockwise. The left seat track was rolled 10 degrees counterclockwise about its longitudinal axis. The right seat track was pitched 1 0 degrees down about its aftmost seat to test fixture attach- ment. The tests in the combined vertical/horizontal direction were conducted with the ATD-occupied seating system in its nominal position with the seat rotated about its lateral axis in a manner to orient the inertial load vector as shown in Figure 1 . TEST SPECIMEN DESCRIPTION The test specimen is a forward facing, single-place exec- utive seat intended for use in the Challenger CL-601 air- plane. The seat, which utilizes a lap belt only restraint system, is composed of three basic parts. The pedestal comprises the seat base, which is affixed to the aircraft by means of seat tracks. It supports the mov- able portion of the chair, which is comprised of the seat- pan and seatback. The lap belt restraint is attached to the seatpan. The seatpan may be adjusted laterally and longitudinally rela- tive to the pedestal. A clutch plate attached to the seat- pan acts as friction lock between the pedestal and the seat pan. Activation of the clutch plate provides for lat- eral and longitudinal seat adjustments. The seatback is a composite honeycomb panel with epoxy/fiberglass and epoxy/graphite face skins. The seat is attached to the floor structure by fitting eight attachment studs into standard airline-style seat tracks. Four studs each fit into two parallel tracks. One stud attaches the forward end of the pedestal, while three studs are used to attach the aft end of the pedestal. The forward and aftmost attachment points are spaced approximately 15 inches apart. The seat is designed to absorb energy in three main areas to protect the occupant and minimize structural loads on the seat and its attachment structure. • The seat uses a firm cushion, which is intended to reduce the spinal load of the occupant during the impact by minimizing dynamic amplification. • The seat configuration employs a metal seat web with an aluminum/fiberglass honeycomb panel that is located between the seatpan and the seat web - which constitutes the seating surface. This panel core is designed to control the downward movement of the occupant and thus reduce the spinal load of the occupant. • The pedestal has two key features that allow it to absorb energy in the forward direction. The clutch plate, located between the seatpan and the pedestal, absorbs energy as a result of the friction from the sliding surfaces. In addition, the pedestal legs have a circular mandrel located directly in front of them. During forward loading, the seat legs absorb energy by bearing against and bending over the mandrels. Figure 2. Test Specimen on the CAMI Sled TEST SET-UP TEST PROCEDURES - To allow for an objective evalua- tion of each facility, the seat was installed in a consistent manner for each test. The seat manufacturer provided a 353</page><page sequence="3">test plan for this program, which followed the procedures in SAE Aerospace Standard AS8049.[3] The authors of this paper and a representatlve(s) of the seat manufac- turer were present for each test. SEAT ADJUSTMENT - The seat back was in the fully upright position. The seat was manually adjusted to be centered in the longitudinal direction and fully outboard (to the left) in the lateral direction. ANTHROPOMORPHIC TEST DEVICE (ATD) - A Hybrid II Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) as defined in 49 CFR Part 572, Subpart Β was used in the tests.[4] The ATD was seated in a manner to enhance reproducible results as described in SAE AS 8049. TEST DATA REQUIREMENTS The following data was gathered from each test facility for the purpose of comparing results from the different labs. • Sled acceleration in the x-(forward) direction (G's) • Right front leg attachment loads in the x-, y-(lateral), and z-(vertical) directions (lbs.) • Left front leg attachment loads in the x-, y-, and z- directions (lbs.) • Right rear leg attachment loads in the x-, y-, and z- directions (lbs.) • Left rear leg attachment loads in the x-, y-, and z- directions (lbs.) • Left and right lap belt forces (lbs.) • Lumbar load in the ATD in the z-direction (lbs.) {For the combined vertical/longitudinal test only} • Sled velocity change (ft/sec) • Permanent seat deformations at selected points • Head strike envelope (if acquired). LONGITUDINAL TEST DATA PRESENTATION LONGITUDINAL TEST -Two longitudinal with yaw tests were conducted at each facility. Due to a malfunction of the test device, test results are not shown for the second test at TWSU. That malfunction resulted in an abnormal pulse that was not consistent with the desired test pulse. During the second test at Simula Ine, three seat legs experienced structural fractures. Only selected results are shown for that test. Figure 3 shows a typical test set- up at a horizontal sled facility while Figure 4 shows a typ- ical test set-up at a drop tower facility. TEST PULSE - Review of the summary acceleration data found in Tables 1 and 2 for the combined longitudi- nal with yaw condition indicates that all of the test pulses met the regulatory requirements for pulse shape, as well as peak acceleration, rise time, and velocity change. Fig- ure 5 compares the test pulses acquired during this eval- uation program. Although it is difficult to distinguish individual test pulses in this figure, the grouping depicts 354 their commonality. Review of Figure 5 indicates that all the pulse shapes are similar up to their peak acceleration value. As one might expect, MGA Research Corpora- tion's HYGE accelerator test facility provided the best tri- angular pulse shape as shown in Figure 6. That can be attributed to the basic design of the HYGE test device that permits close control of the trailing side of the test pulse by use of a carefully designed metering pin. Of interest is a comparison of Wichita State's decelerator test pulse with those developed by Simula Inc.'s drop tower. The test pulses are nearly identical even though the respective test facilities function differently and use totally different means to develop the test pulse. Figure 7 illustrates the repeatability of the Simula Inc. drop tower. Figure 3. Test Set-up at a Horizontal Sled Figure 4. Test Set-up at a Drop Tower</page><page sequence="4">Table 1.

Figure 5. Overlay of Acquired Test Pulses The Excel CORREL function values shown in Table 2 are a measure of the quality of the shape of the test pulse. A CORREL function value equal to 1 .0 indicates that the test pulse shape identically conforms to the desired isos- celes triangular pulse shape identified in the seat dynamic performance standards. The more the pulse shape deviates from the desired pulse shape, the lower the value of the CORREL function. One should recog- nize that the CORREL function values shown in Table 2 are only a measure of the pulse shapes developed during this evaluation program. These CORREL values should not be interpreted as a measure of the ability of any test facility. Test pulse shapes that are currently developed at each of the test facilities may differ significantly from those presented here. Figure 6. MGA Test Pulses 355</page><page sequence="5">Figure 7. Simula Inc. Test Pulses REAR SEAT LEG - The test specimen was attached to the test fixture through load cells that measured the seat leg to test fixture interface loads at each seat leg. The seat leg to test fixture interface loads provide a measure of the structural response and performance of the test specimen. The seat leg to test fixture interface loads can also be used to evaluate the consistency of the test results between the test facilities and the repeatability of the test results at a specific test facility. If the test condi- tions, i.e., test pulses, are significantly different, then one would expect significantly different seat leg to test fixture interface loads. The test specimen was symmetrical. However, since the seat was installed at a 10-degree angle with respect to the test sled centerline, the resultant seat legs to test fix- ture loads were unsymmetrical. The rear left-hand seat leg was the highest loaded (tension) seat leg. The acquired values of the vertical component of the rear left leg loads are compared. The largest difference (13 %) in the value of the vertical component of the acquired rear left leg loads at a specific test facility is shown in Figure 8, whereas the smallest difference (5 %) is shown in Figure 9. Figure 10 compares the vertical component of all of the rear left leg loads acquired during this evaluation pro- gram. Though it is difficult to distinguish individual leg load time histories in this figure, the figure does illustrate their commonality. Review of Figure 10 indicates that all of the rear left leg load time histories (the vertical load components) are similar in shape and magnitude. Table 3 summarizes the peak values of the vertical com- ponent of the rear left leg loads. Also shown is a normal- ized load ratio that was obtained by dividing each acquired peak load value by the average of all of the acquired peak load values (excluding the second Simula Inc. test value). The normalized load ratio data indicate that the peak magnitudes of the acquired rear left leg loads range from 8 % below to 5 % above the average value. Figure 8. CAMI Rear Leg Loads Figure 9.

There is one noted discontinuity in the data plots found in Figure 10. The discontinuity corresponds to the rear left leg load time history acquired from the second Simula Inc. test. The rear legs separated from the test fixture during that test. The time of separation is visible on the data plot. The left front seat leg was also found sepa- rated post-test. The right front leg remained attached. The seat leg attachments are designed to yield to absorb the impact energy and they deformed significantly during each test. However this was the only structural fracture of any of the seat legs noted during the test series. The cause was not determined. This test did have the highest peak acceleration value and one of the highest accelera- tion onset rates. However, with the limited testing that was conducted, it could not be determined if that was a contributing factor. FRONT SEAT LEG - The front left seat leg to test fixture interface loads were also used to evaluate the consis- tency of the test results between the test facilities and the repeatability of the test results at a specific test facility. Again, if the test conditions, i.e., test pulses, are signifi- cantly different, then one would expect significantly differ- ent seat leg to test fixture interface loads. The data acquired for the front left seat leg was selected to be included in this paper to complement the rear left seat leg data. The acquired values of the vertical compo- nent of the front left leg loads are compared. The front left seat leg was loaded in compression. The largest difference (14 %) in the value of the vertical component of the acquired front left leg loads at a specific test facility is shown in Figure 11, whereas the smallest difference (1 %) is shown in Figure 12. Figure 13 compares the ver- tical component of all the front left leg loads acquired dur- ing this evaluation program. Although it is difficult to distinguish individual seat leg load time histories in this figure, the figure does illustrate their commonality. Review of Figure 13 indicates that all the front left leg load time histories (the vertical load components), like the rear left leg load time histories, are similar in shape and magnitude. Figure 1 1 . CAMI Front Leg Loads Figure 12. MGA Front Leg Loads Table 4 summarizes the peak values of the vertical com- ponent of the front left leg loads. Also shown is a normal- ized load ratio that was obtained by dividing each acquired peak load value by the average of all of the acquired peak load values (excluding the second Simula Inc. test value). The normalized load ratio data indicate that the peak magnitudes of the acquired front left leg loads range from 14 % below to 6 % above the average value. These values compare well with the normalized load ratios presented for the rear left legs. 357</page><page sequence="7">Figure 1 3. Overlay of Front Leg loads Table 4.

As before, there is one noted discontinuity in the data plot found in Figure 13. The discontinuity corresponds to a separation of the rear legs during the second Simula Inc. test. The left front leg was also found separated post- test. The right front leg remained attached. SEAT LAP BELTS - Lap belt loads were also selected for comparison in this evaluation program. However, it was found that complete lap belt load data were not acquired during each test. Also, in some cases where it was acquired, it could not be determined at the time of this review if the data corresponded to the right or left seat belt. Thus a limited review of lap belt load data is pre- sented. Figures 14 and 15 were generated to provide a sense of the range of the magnitudes of the lap belt loads. Since the handedness of the Simula #1 test data could not be determined, that data was included in both the left and right lap belt load data plots. Lap belt load digital data were not available for the MGA Research Corporation tests and they are not found in the lap belt load data plots. The peak magnitudes of the right lap belt load data found in Table 5 range from 1474 lbs. to 2050 lbs., a 39 % difference, if all of the data except the Simula #2 test is included. The rear seat legs fractured during the Simula #2 test as described in the discussion of the leg loads. Likewise the peak magnitudes of the left lap belt load data found in Table 5 range from 1610 lbs. to 2060 lbs., a 28 % difference. Figure 16 illustrates the range of lap belt load data acquired during the CAM I tests. Figure 14. Right Lap Belt Loads Summary Figure 15. Left Lap Belt Loads Summary The lap belt load data exhibits more scatter than that found in the seat leg to test fixture load data. This result was not surprising. The data scatter is most likely attrib- utable to the means available for collecting lap belt load data. A lap belt load transducer is typically installed on the lap belt webbing and used to acquire lap belt load data. Lap belt load transducers are sensitive to contact with objects during the test. Accurate load data can only be obtained when the lap belt load transducer is installed on a free length of lap belt webbing and contact with objects is avoided during the test. Contact between the anthropomorphic test device and the lap belt transducers could have occurred during these test. That contact would affect the acquired load data and reduce the repeatability of test results. 358</page><page sequence="8">Table 5.

CAMI Lap Belt Loads Summary OTHER COMMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS -The frac- ture of three of the seat legs during the Simula #2 test was the only significant difference noted in this test series. Review of the seat leg load time histories for that test indicates that the rear left leg was the source of the initial fracture. The cause of the seat leg fracture was not determined. The seat leg load time histories for the right-hand seat legs were also evaluated. The acquired loads did exhibit somewhat more data scatter than that seen for the left- hand legs however the differences were not considered significant. Therefore the data are not presented. Seat deformations were measured after some of the tests. That data is also not presented here because the measured deformations are not true structural deforma- tions but a combination of seat clutch plate slippage and structural deformation. There was no pre-test control of the clutch plate frictional force. This introduced an unquantifiable variable in the deformation measure- ment. It could not be determined whether the measured seat deformation was attributable to seat pan movement due to clutch plate slippage or structural deformation. VERTICAL TEST DATA PRESENTATION COMBINED VERTICAULONGITUDINAL TEST - Two com- bined vertical/longitudinal tests were conducted at each facility. All of the test data were used in this review. The second CAMI test did not meet all of the test parameters given in Figure 1 . However the test pulse was very close to the required pulse, thus the data were considered to be applicable for this study. Figure 2 shows a typical test set-up at a horizontal test facility while Figure 17 shows a typical test set-up at a drop tower facility. Figure 1 7. Test Set-up at a Drop Tower TEST PULSE - Review of the summary acceleration data found in Tables 6 and 7 for the combined vertical/ longitudinal condition indicates that all but one of the test pulses meet the regulatory requirements regarding pulse shape, as well as peak acceleration, rise time, and veloc- ity change. The CAMI A94020 test pulse did not meet the required peak acceleration and rise time parameters. Figure 18 illustrates a comparison of the test pulses acquired during this evaluation program. Though it is dif- ficult to distinguish individual test pulses in this figure, the figure does depict their commonality. With the exception of the CAMI A92193 test pulse, a review of Figure 18 finds that all the pulse shapes are similar up to their peak acceleration value. Again the MGA Research Corpora- tion's HYGE accelerator test facility provided the best tri- angular pulse shape as shown in Figure 19. Figures 19, 359</page><page sequence="9">20, and 21 illustrate the level of repeatability demon- strated by these test facilities. Table 6.

Simula Test Pulses LIMBAR COLUMN LOADS - The loads measured between the pelvis and the lumbar column of the anthro- pomorphic test device were also selected for comparison 360</page><page sequence="10">in this evaluation program. A 1500 lbs. maximum allow- able compression load is given as a pass/fail criteria in the seat dynamic performance standards, FAR 25.562 (c)(2). It was found that the lumbar column loads acquired during the CAMI A92193 and the first MGA Research Corporation tests exceeded the pass/fail criteria. Figure 21 . Wichita State Test Pulses The acquired values of the lumbar column loads were found to be comparable. The smallest difference (3 %) in the value of the acquired lumbar column load at a specific test facility is shown in Figure 22 whereas the largest dif- ference (35 %) is shown in Figure 23. Figure 24 com- pares the lumbar column loads acquired during this evaluation program. Although it is difficult to distinguish individual lumbar column load time histories in this figure, one can see their commonality. Review of Figure 24 indi- cates that all of the lumbar column load time histories are similar in shape and magnitude. Figure 22. Wichita State Lumbar Column Loads Table 8 summarizes the peak values of the lumbar column loads. Also shown is a normalized load ratio that was obtained by dividing each acquired peak load value by the average of all the acquired peak load values. The normalized load ratio data indicate that the peak magnitudes of the acquired lumbar column loads range from 13 % below to 21 % above the average value. 361 Figure 23. CAMI Lumbar Column Loads It can be seen that the peak lumbar column load values cluster in two different groups. Both of the Wichita State tests, the Simula Inc. #2 test, and the CAMI A94020 test appear grouped. The maximum and the minimum peak lumbar column load values found in this group differ by only 5 %. Figure 24. Overlay of Lumbar Column Loads Both of the MGA Research Corporation tests and the CAMI A92193 test also appear grouped. The maximum and the minimum peak lumbar column load values found in this group differ by 14 %. This apparent difference might be explained by an anomaly discovered in the test procedure. It was found that installation of the anthropomorphic test device in the seat is a critical procedure for the combined vertical/ longitudinal test condition. Specifically, it was discovered that, in horizontal test sleds, the anthropomorphic test device needs to be installed in a manner that com- presses the seat cushion prior to the test. The pre-test seat cushion compression simulates that obtained by a seated occupant. It is difficult to install the anthropomor- phic test device in this manner on a horizontal test sled, since the seat is installed with its base rotated 60 degrees from the horizontal position. Without the pre- test seat cushion compression, the anthropomorphic test device is not firmly seated. The unrepresentative inter- face between the seat and the anthropomorphic test device can cause a dynamic amplification of the pelvic lumbar column load.</page><page sequence="11">Table 8.

The ATD was installed in a near upright, seated position and the seat cushion was naturally compressed in the Simula drop tower, as shown in Figure 17. The Wichita State University test facility was aware of the importance of properly seating the ATD with pre-test seat cushion compression when they conducted their test series. Likewise, at the time CAMI conducted test A94020, their personnel were also aware of the impor- tance of properly seating the ATD with pre-test, seat cushion compression. Thus, it can be surmised that these tests were conducted with the appropriate pre-test seat cushion compression. That may not have been the case in the first CAMI and the MGA tests. This would explain the grouping and the consistency of the grouped test results. As a result of this test program and other studies, the SAE Aerospace Standard AS8049 was revised to include a more definitive procedure for the installation of the ATD to ensure proper seat cushion compression and enhance consistency of test results. FLOOR/LEG REACTIONS AND SEAT BELT LOADS - The seat leg loads and the seat belt loads acquired from the combined vertical/longitudinal tests are significantly lower than those respective loads acquired in the longitu- dinal with yaw tests. Data comparisons for the combined vertical/longitudinal tests are not presented since they are similar to those presented for the longitudinal with yaw tests CONCLUSIONS The following observations and conclusions are drawn from review of the teat data in this evaluation program. 1 . All of the participating test facilities were capable of developing test pulses that complied with the regula- tory requirements found in 14 CFR 25, § FAR 25.562. 2. Three distinct types of test facilities were used in this evaluation and it was found that the type of test facil- ity does not significantly affect the test results. 3. This evaluation demonstrated that when seat dynamic tests are conducted in a consistent manner the test results are consistent. 4. For the longitudinal with yaw test condition: A review of the seat legs structural loads and lap belt loads data found that the acquired load times histories and maximum load values were consistent within typical test scatter. • The peak aft legs loads values ranged from 5 % above to 8 % below the average load. • Similarly the peak fwd leg load values ranged from 6 % above to 1 4 % below the average load. • The peak lap belt load values differed by 39 % for the right lap belt and 28 % for the left lap belt. 5. For the combined vertical/longitudinal condition: A review of the lumbar column loads data found that the acquired load times histories were consistent with each other. However the maximum lumbar col- umn load values exhibited more test scatter than expected. That was attributed to an inconsistent test procedure for installation of the anthropomorphic test device in the seat. 6. When the lumbar column loads were grouped with respect to consistent installation of the anthropomor- phic test device, the peak load values were consis- tent within typical test scatter. When grouped in this manner, the peak lumbar column values differed by 5 % for one group and 14 % for the other group.
