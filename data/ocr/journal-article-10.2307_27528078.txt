<plain_text><page sequence="1">FISKE'S "THROUGH NATURE TO GOD."1 Somehowt there has got abroad a rumor to the effect that the old reliable, religious highway is rutted badly by heavy ecclesiastical traffic. Backwater, presumably from Noah's flood, wherein the whale of the prophet Jonah is wont to be have himself unseemly, has floated, it is whispered, sundry bridges away. A cyclone every now and then for the last few decades has swooped down and whirled up as dust to heaven the ancient, honest macadam of proof texts, which? gossip reports?has fallen again to earth like the hail of Egypt, demolishing all wayside inns of grace. And, worst of all, the dogmatic milestones erected by the fathers at sun dry times have been ruthlessly broken up to repair the road bed; yet in vain, for nothing?it is affirmed on the excellent authority of ''they say"?remains in pristine integrity at this hour but the deceptive signpost: " To God." Now Mr. Fiske has taken this rumor of a dire state of the way of salvation so seriously that the philanthropic spirit has moved him to engineer forthwith a new road to God, not through the supernatural, but via nature itself. He describes this road in his new book, and we have just attempted to go over it after him. Conscience compels us to say that we found the survey truly fine, but the metal more than doubtful, and the con struction nowise for posterity. Dropping metaphors, we must premise that Mr. Fiske's little book is constructed?perhaps quite unconsciously?on a trinitarian plan. First of the three essays, and furnishing the statement of the main theme, comes: the "Mystery of Evil" (a vindication of God the Father?). Second: the " Cosmic Roots of Love and Self-sacrifice" (the eternal pr?existence and incarnation of God the Son?). Third and last: the "Everlasting Reality of Religion" (the doctrine l"Through Nature to God." By John Fiske. Boston: Houghton Mifflin &amp; Co. 1899.</page><page sequence="2">Fiske's "Through Nature to God." 13 of God the Holy Ghost?). In each of these three essays Mr. Fiske leads us to believe that he is undertaking the demonstration of a definite theorem. The general method is to open with a picturesque presentation of difficulties, so candid that we at once conclude the eminent writer would not write at all had he nothing original to contribute towTard the problem's solution. Then follows a more or less re spectful setting aside of what other men have done, and a brief statement of what needs doing. The reader is by this quite sure that much is to come. He peruses eagerly the eloquent exposition of the law of evolution as involved in certain particular processes, and when still under the spell thereof is forthwith offered sundry exquisitely worded gen eralizations, which no one cares to question lest his good breeding and fine literary taste be impugned, and which some how induce a belief that something has been done toward the establishment of the thesis. Alas! the Q. E. D. is less in the logic than in the style. Let this general criticism be substantiated by a succinct account of each essay. In the first, after a restatement of the Biblical story of Adam's fall, Mr. Fiske brings us to consider the impossibil ity of understanding how there can be evil in a world made and preserved by an all-good and all-powerful deity. To maintain the all-goodness, the all-power has been usually sacrificed to some extent. An evil material or principle is held variously responsible for defective methods or imperfect results. Mill's suggestion that the limitation of God's power allows men to view their poor strivings after the good as needed assistance rendered the Creator by the creature for the completion of his taskwork, is thrown aside because a non-omnipotent deity is rightly seen to be no God at all. Calvinism, on the other hand, is extolled by Mr. Fiske be cause it insisted on both the omnipotence and the absolute goodness, taking logical refuge in man's incapacity to ascer tain what is really " good for God." The " Gesta Roman orum " is quoted in support of this position (why not Par nell's immortal version of the tale?) to commend respectfully to our consideration the disquieting suggestion that what</page><page sequence="3">H The Sewanee Review. would be in man criminal may be praiseworthy and right eous altogether in an all-wise God. Clearly his censure of Auguste Comte (somewhat frivolous, and responsible for any flippancy in the present article) and his relegation of John Stuart Mill to a bygone age of thought obligate Mr. Fiske to do better than both. He is to save the omnipotence along with the all-goodness. What does he actually achieve ? A brilliant presentation of the modern (and ancient) theory of the unity of nature (implied in such words as " cosmos" and " universus") ; a clear precision of the content of con scious life?successive changes and discriminations; and then the positive assertion is ventured that, without evil and pain for contrast, good and pleasure must remain unknown and as though, therefore, they were not. The moral progress of the world is, however, believed to be the elimination of evil. Wherefore, to save himself and his readers from the prepos terous paradox that moral progress tends to moral annihila tion, Mr. Fiske quite ingeniously suggests that good may be some time discriminated only from a lower form of itself (why not so discriminated at the start and ever after?), and finally, in the day when all base metals turn of their own sweet will to gold, good will be distinguished from a mere memory?a mental presentation of something whereto no existing external thing corresponds any more! (One asks then, legitimately enough, why not always distinguished from some hallucination or nightmare of phantasy, rather than from a hideous, God-devised reality?) It seems to us that Mr. Fiske has only limited the power of God less overtly, but no less disastrously to religious sen timent, than John Stuart Mill. He has tried to show that God could not (or would not) make man capable of discerning good without the distressful contrast which evil affords. But we should be disposed to question altogether the truth of Mr. Fiske's assertion concerning the knowledge of good. May not pleasure (one kind of sensation or emotion) be differen tiated from a lack of sensation or emotion?one variety of pleasure from another (as Mr. Fiske admits himself on p. 55), sweet from no taste as well as from sour or bitter, moral</page><page sequence="4">Fiske's " Through Nature to God." 15 good from the indifferent as wTell as from moral evil? And so to us the latter seems to vitiate the former portion of Mr. Fiske's argument. It appears, indeed as though out of sheer reluctance to hang on either horn of the angry dilemma, he has permitted himself to be gloriously tossed up by both horns of the logical monster into the "intense " though, we are compelled to admit, stylistically beautiful " inane." In the second essay Mr. Fiske devotes twenty pages to stating difficulties. The peaceful seeming of nature is sur face illusion; really there is everywhere internecine, truce less war without quarter. The prodigality of means to ends in the cosmic process seems in a high degree "unintelligent, not to say immoral." A Caliban philosophy explaining this universal waste as wanton mockery, a monstrous piece of cynicism, is set aside with deserved contempt. Finally Mr. Fiske respectfully protests against what seems the import of a famous address of Mr. Huxley. To set the ethical process over against the cosmic process would involve an intolera ble breach of continuity. In language of considerable grace the cosmic process is credited with an original intention of initiating the ethical process, and of being itself ultimately more and more replaced by the same as human history ad vances toward some " far off divine event." This intention, thus charitably ascribed, is not so easy to substantiate if we muse on Mr. Fiske's frank admission (p. 66) that the fittest for survival is not always the best or most highly organized; that, in a word, evolution sometimes spells degeneration. Clearly the cosmic process is so well satisfied with its good intentions as to be in no great haste ! For twenty-eight pages Mr. Fiske gives us a portrayal of the genesis of man. First, nat ural selection as understood by Darwin produces the rough physical man. Then, as Wallace saw, variations of intelli gence become more profitable than variations of body, and the brain develops. Next, according to Mr. Fiske's own contribution to the theory of evolution, the period of infancy was prolonged because the antenatal sufficed not for the reg istration in nerve centers of the parent's complicated expe rience. Helplessness of progeny brought about affectional</page><page sequence="5">i6 The Sewanee Review. relations between mother and young, greater permanence of the family, whence in due season the clan and the subordi nation of individual and parental interests to social good. In ten pages a little farther on Mr. Fiske speaks with no com mon exquisiteness of sentiment concerning the part materni ty has played in the beginnings of altruism. Yet what is after all the clear gain of the religious reader? In Sections X. and XII. he is assured that "toward the spir itual perfection of humanity the stupendous momentum of the cosmic process has all along been tending; that spirit ual perfection is the true goal of evolution, the divine end that was involved from the beginning" (p. 113). "The moral sentiments, the moral law, devotion to unselfish ends, disinterested love, nobility of soul?these are nature's most highly wrought products, latest in coming to maturity; they are the consummation toward which all earlier prophecy has pointed" (p. 130). Yet on page 123 Mr. Fiske registers his disgust with preceding stages: "Nearly nine-tenths of our planet's past lifetime, measured in duration, had passed away without achieving any higher result." The sweeping victory of the mammals over the " oviparous dinosauri, crawl ing or bounding over the land, splashing amid mighty waters, whizzing batlike through the air, horrible brutes innumera ble, with bulky bodies and tiny brains, clumsy, coarse in fiber, and cold-blooded" does not atone for the fact that the cosmic process was so long content to have them lord it over creation. If for incalculable aeons "the survival of the fit test" was the only law of life, if Mr. Fiske is right in stating of such a universe that "there is not even dignity in it, noth ing whatever but resistless all-producing and all-consuming energy" (p. 78); and if energy, in fine, be not in itself something good and sublime?then one asks how shall you account for the divine patience? Is it not, when coupled with all power and all wisdom, immoral, wicked? Mr. Fiske merely tries to prove the end good, and assumes that the means he has admitted to be in themselves odious are thereby justified. Not so. Nor are we content when told that " such a universe is not the one in which we live." Even if moral</page><page sequence="6">Fiske's " Through Nature to God." 17 ity has been produced, so as to dominate our world, the process of its production according to Mr. Fiske's own pres entation appears heinously immoral. With righteous man the best end requires for its acceptable realization means in themselves wholly worthy and noble. So also with deity, or God is not as holy as holy men. Perhaps, howrever, he may be justified on the ground of limited power ! Furthermore, Mr. Fiske is carefully reticent as to the plan et's probable future. The astronomer has something to say about dead planets and extinct suns. On the principle set forth by Mr. Fiske that the justification of the whole book of life is to be sought in the concluding chapter, what of the ugly hypothesis that the last laugher who shall laugh best, therefore, should issue conquering and to conquer from the world of the microscope, close cousin to the microbe? For our own part the entire process can alone be justified on con dition that every stage is felt to have its own sufficient raison d'?tre. The God of the cosmic process cannot be allowed to seem cynically indifferent to means; and Mr. Fiske's whole essay, therefore, strikes us as affording a rarely charm ing instance of the adoption (so common by literary men) of the tactics successfully practiced for ages by their primate, the fabulous inkfish, hiding from the enemy of doubt (is God both all-good and all-powerful?) and deeming him an nihilated because concealed by clouds of a non-translucent secretion. Mr. Fiske's third and final essay may, however, save the day for him. " Deo erexit Voltaire " is an interesting section attempting to show that modern " atheism" (if there be any) is a prejudice inherited from the eighteenth century, which went too far in its revolt from medievalism. The Athana sian conception of the immanent deity is, however, quite com petent to rescue us from the Latin theology, with its god ex ternal to nature. This god of the Greek fathers Mr. Fiske proceeds to identify with the First Cause, criticising Spen cer's name " the Unknowable " as purely negative and mis leading, however in strict parlance correct. So far we have nothing new. The difficulties in conceiving the First Cause 2</page><page sequence="7">i8 The Sewanee Review. as psychical are admitted to be " insurmountable." Why, then, we may ask, surmount them or appear to do so ? Because " the atom and the cosmical ether" are likewise inconceiva ble? This is a mere argumentuni ad hominem. The mate rialists may answer that the "atom" and the "cosmical ether" will be cheerfully given up when some more credible hypoth eses are forthcoming to order as well as they do the observed phenomena. Does the hypothesis " a quasi-human god " subserve any similar purpose ? Is it held with similar reserve ? Is not the reason for the hypothesis an emotional one ? Wit ness the little philosophic assistance it gives, and the difficul ties it creates beyond the region of all verifiable thought.' In any case it is possible for some one to deny atom and cos mical ether as entities, but it is the very vital purpose of the hypothetic god to serve as ens entium. Let us leave the uni verse unexplained rather than offer as explanation something in itself more inexplicable yet. And this, we say, because " science can deal only with second causes " (p. 141 ), where fore all dealing with the First Cause must admittedly be al together unscientific. It must be a matter of liking, not of demonstration; of temperament rather than inherent proba bility?in other words, of faith and not of knowledge. So much for our materialist's answer to the arp'umentum ad hominem. Mr. Fiske then proceeds to state that religion has had (always and everywhere) three essential postulates: the quasi-human god, the undying human soul, the ethical sig nificance of the unseen world. That this is historically de monstrable may be gravely questioned. The religion of the Old Testament knows not the second and little of the third. Confucianism ignores the first. Primitive Buddhism is be lieved by many authorities to have denied all three. They are, however, the essentials of the Christian religion as un derstood by a large section of our cultured classes to-day. Mr. Fiske proceeds to advance an argument for religion? that is, for the reality of somewhat whereto the religious life of man has been a response. Now this argument seems to be very strong indeed, but it does not prove anything so much as the essay would, by its structure, lead one to sup</page><page sequence="8">Fiske's " Through Nature to God." 19 pose. Mr. Fiske says himself (p. 192): "Upon the view7 here presented every specific opinion ever entertained by man respecting religious things may be wrong and in all probability exceedingly crude, and yet the everlasting reality of religion (in its three indispensable elements as here set forth) remains unassailable." Erase the words we have put in parentheses and the reader has the actual result of the argument. How comforting to the practical religious man ! There is a meaning in the religious evolution, and perhaps thou hast no access thereto! For whether Mr. Fiske's defi nition of religion be right or wrong, it is not inclusive enough to carry with it the authority of the whole historic evolution of religion, nor definite and exclusive enough to yield much contentment to any but the few who believe very nearly with this most recent defender of the Faith. Is there indeed any thing men differ about more hopelessly than as to exactly what constitutes the essentials of the Christian religion? Who, then, will settle for another the more disputable ques tion yet, as to the indispensable characteristics of religion in general? Whatever the demerits of this lengthy analysis, if is not made in malice. Dire truly must be in our day the need of some sort of intellectual conciliation with a part of the re ligious life about us that any would-be mediator whose good will is apparent should be submitted to practically no cross examination. Such reflections are pathetic. Where is the old faith that could have afforded to scorn any defense so pitiful as this? Not long ago in our most prominent denom inational paper appeared a review of Max Nordau's " De generation , ' ' commending that disreputable volume of pseudo scientific slander because it assailed so many enemies of the Christian religion, and condoning the fact that by the same token it set the initiators of Christianity among degenerates ! Truly we bear ourselves humbly these days, and are suffi ciently thankful for a crumb or two that shall fall from the scientists' table for the consumption of us poor dogs of the faith. Nor will it do to say in apology for Mr. Fiske's book that its author is not a Christian apologist; only a scientist,</page><page sequence="9">20 The Sewanee Review. a philosopher, a historian. If he publishes an essay in the ology, he is entitled to be treated as a theologian. If he errs, justice demands indeed that he be beaten with many rods?the greater the offender the less does the offense need charitable extenuation. And we mean by this very critique to express indirectly, but all the more effectively therefore, the great esteem we have conceived for Mr. Fiske. In conclusion, a few considerations shall be jotted down which may perhaps help some disappointed reader. Why the hypothesis of a quasi-human god? Because of the long pedigree of the idea? Surely not. Its movement from the single phenomenon to the group of phenomena, and thence to the larger synthesis beyond definite mental grasp, has the appearance not of a victorious progress, but of an ignominious egress before the conquering idea of mechan ism. The difference between Aryan south of the Hindu-Kush and Aryan in Europe?is it not largely one between dream ing the whole, as spirit, and handling the parts, as mechan ism? Surely this can yield little contentment to the theist. Plainly, we zvant to believe in a God. It helps us to fight the battle of life. It helps us to survive and to develop. " But it is not true!" says the atheistic evolutionist. "What is truth? " we reply. For any man it is that which can be thought and believed by him with entire intellectual satisfac tion. If theism helps men to survive, then there must come the day when there shall be none alive to deny it: it will be truth to all mankind. For the present it is truth to us. And because we wish you equipped as well for the struggle of life as we are, therefore we wish you also could believe as we. This is at all events an honest answer?which can be rid iculed, but which admits of no sensible rejoinder unless that "atheism tends to survival," a thesis hard to maintain, since by many it is claimed that there never was an atheist. But why a quasi-Jmman God ? Because anthropomorphism is inevitable. It is merely a question of more or less. There can be no valid objection to anthropomorphism so long as it be not irreverent, immoral, or obscene. Rightly, we think, does Mr. Fiske insist that " Infinite Person" is no more in</page><page sequence="10">Fiske's " Through Nature to God." 21 adequate than "Infinite Force" as a description of God. But we cannot agree with him when he says that " wre see a rational principle at work" (p. 143). What we do see is happenings susceptible of rational explanation at work; on the other hand we also see others which obstinately refuse, whatever our ingenuity, so to be construed. Thence we may conclude to a God not rational, but either partly ra tional or pr?ter-rational. The former leaves us without God; the latter vindicates deity just as our religious senti ment would expect. Moreover, should it be argued (as it has been) that the Deity came only to consciousness and reason at a relatively recent date ; that with him as with man progress has not been the result of meditation (cf. p. 107), so that he did not first plan and then execute?our answer would be that if he be preter-rational, it was surely not so with him, for even we, as we advance in reason, tend more and more first to think and then to do. Now, clearly, our God, to be worshipful, must be conceived not only as all-wise but also as omnipotent; yet by his all power we do not mean to imply that he can do all that is thinkable, but always the very thing he wants to do. If, therefore, arguing of course from mere human analogy, we find a reason why he should have wished to do just what he has actually done, we shall find no cause for doubting his omnipotence in the fact that he did not do otherwise. Before, however, the all-goodness of God be discussed at all, we must make up our minds as to what we understand by goodness. Do we mean efficiency? Do we mean kind ness to other beings (ourselves and such as we sympathize with), or do we mean love of what they have it in them to he? Now moral evil is but a variety of that which causes pain? pain in this casero our moral being. Pain always comes of arrested or overstrained functions. There are three ways of behaving toward it: to shrink, wail, complain, and cringe; or to resent it and make matters worse; or, lastly, to utilize it. But how? Clearly for development. Necessity is the mother of invention, proverbial wisdom tells us, and necessi</page><page sequence="11">22 The Sewanee Review. ty is in the last analysis pain. If one function by arrest or overstrain causes anguish, set another function into opera tion which will give a pleasure capable not only of neutral izing the pain, but of absorbing it so as to become an ecsta sy. Thus in our despair new powers are discovered and developed; the bliss of victory?nay, even the pride of stub born resistance, meeting with ultimate defeat?reconciles us to the hardships of battle. There is " the joy of seeing how much one can stand," the pride of power over one's self, which are of themselves no mean compensations. Thus the agonies which forced us to reach and overleap the bounds which circumscribed our power became at the time swallowed up in the sense of growth, and were afterwards sweet in their bitterness, as the price of achievement and the test of virtue. It is nevertheless quite clear that to all cowardly wailers or foolhardy protestors against the economy of pain, it must ap pear a discouraging, paralyzing, and destructive horror. Just because to him who is at-one with the divine creative purpose it is the pressure of the fashioning holy hand which he trusts, even to his own undoing; therefore to him who insists upon considering himself a finished product, it must seem the interference of some malign enemy of God. For God as creator is also destroyer, as the history of our earth testifies. Like the artist, he makes and chooses a resistant material that the mastery of the ideal may be the more trium phant. But he is in love less with one idea than with a series of ideas ; and each one of the series is an ideal to him in turn, so that stuff becomes product, and then product is again stuff with reference to further product. Each step of the whole proc ess is an indulgence of creative energy, a delight ; and every stage, however protracted, is but a sweetness long drawn out. To him there is no " dreary period " as to Mr. Fiske; nor is there to the man who sees the long history of life as that of God's creative bliss. Now as to the other meanings of good. Is God good?that is, kind to us? Surely not in the sense of making it easy for us, singing us soothing lullabies and providing sweet meats for half-awake moments. But kind in the sense of</page><page sequence="12">Fiske's " Through Nature to God." 23 desiring for us the ecstasy of progress? Yes! Some will urge, however, God is pitiful, else he had not produced pity in us; whereby the fit can no longer fight the unfit and ex terminate them, whereby they are on the contrary obliged to cherish them and even to assist them to propagate their own degenerate selves. Not so would the present writer understand the genesis of pity. It is because God cares ex clusively for the fit, and desires them to struggle more stren uously, that he has made them burden themselves wdth the un fit. The increase of pity means but an acceleration in the rise of the fit by crueler competition among themselves. No, God has not ceased to be Creator. He did not make us, and then indulge in an eternal Sabbath of despair. We can imagine his improving upon us here and there. Who knows but that his mercy through us toward the unfit means a determination to utilize for the production of a new creature those who, failing to understand his creative pressure, have by cowardice or rebellion lost with the privilege of hardship their own up ward chance? Are we not yet clear in our minds what good is? " Do unto thy neighbor as thou wouldst be done by?" Yea, but how wouldst thou be done by? When weak, sick, or cow ardly, soft treatment is thy desire; when well, strong, brave, harshness to the uttermost, to be put on thy mettle, to be compelled to put forth all thy might. Now to our neighbor, when he is well, is it right to apply sick-room ethics? Is it fair to presume him anything but brave? Then surely? for mercy's sake?no mercy in the fair battle of life ! And so in attempting to fashion our idea of God let us see to it that we ascribe to him all goodness, but not an infinite mawkish ness. But what is the religious attitude which harmonizes with some such stouter-hearted notion of God's benevolence? Gratitude to God for the opportunity to cooperate with him which he has chosen to give us by using resistant material. (Plato perhaps was right, and John Stuart Mill, after all, not far wrong.) We shall strive to discover his idea, which is now being realized, and so love its beauty that every moment</page><page sequence="13">24 The Sezvanee Reviezv. in the process shall be to us one of panic joy ! Let us strive to become what we have it in us to be. Let the latent become patent. Let us furthermore strive to make others realize the idea they are capable of representing; making it for them, by all good means at our disposal, a conscious ideal. And lastly, if we can do more to advance the divine creative work by death than by life, let us cheerfully die, or, what is more painful, endure ostracism, obloquy, scorn. The present type views variations as, what they usually are, for the worse. The fortunate variations (spiritually) must therefore expect to incur suspicion. He that is ahead of the van will seem a laggard, rearmost of the rear. But after misunderstanding, unfair treatment, disgrace, comes the dis covery of what the martyr was. The army of heroes is still being recruited, the army of those who are numbered with the transgressors because enlisted in the service of the Cap tain of Salvation. In a word, our practical religion will be: become, cause others to become, die that one better than ourself may come. Now all that has been here hurriedly jotted down by way of suggestion, for space allows nothing like formal statement, is only figurative language. But if anthropomorphism be al lowed a fraction of an inch, who shall forbid it an ell?nay, a mile?provided the results be edifying?that is, liberate en ergy for the development of the believer? The only justifi cation of any conception of God whatever is after all that it ministers to what is noblest in man. Two points only require brief mention with reference to Mr. Fiske's definition of religion: immortality of the soul and the unseen world. To postulate the former as an arti cle of faith, is to vitiate the virtue of heroic sacrifice. To yield my life for the realization of God's idea which is to me an ideal dearer than personal felicity?what is it but a stage trick if I know all the while that I shall survive disembodi ment? And strange to say, the ancient Christian doctrine, if we be not sorely mistaken, is no immortality of the soul, but resurrection of the body. The materialist who denies the soul apart from the body prepares for the re?xamination of</page><page sequence="14">Fiske's "Through Nature to God." 25 the Catholic doctrine. The ghost-survival, usually called immortality of the soul, is the child of superstition, and of a confusion of thought, whereby because my mental image of a thing may outlast it, therefore it is supposed to outlast it self. Ghost-survival for man, to be logically held, must be extended (as theosophists have done) to all beings whatso ever, and signify not merely postexistence but pr?existence. Because I cannot think of my soul as at one with the inani mate world, am I therefore sure that it is immortal? If I can think of death for others, I may infer that others can think of it for me; and probably each looks at the other's case more impartially than at his own. The Christian doc trine means practically a new creation, a reproduction of a body of which the spiritual resultants shall be me, raised perchance to a higher power. That may be a blessed hope ; and if it proves in the increasing severity of competi tion between the fit, a means to survival, will it not some day seem as credible to the higher mankind as that 2+2=4? As for the unseen world, for the very reason that it is unseen, it cannot be made to supplement the defects of this. To argue from the seen to the unseen, means to presume likeness betwixt them. Because this seen world is so bad, therefore the unseen is good ? Surely a pathetical but also an absurd species of reasoning ! Religion must begin by a worship of the seen world ere it can venture to include the unseen. For, after all, the God whom a man worships is always only a sym bol, and is no part of that unseen world, but the life to him of the seen, whom having loved in this wrorld he trusts for and in that world which he has not yet the senses to realize. To him the temple of God is ever the sensible world, and his own sentient and intelligent life. To him the God of that temple is One whose image he has fashioned, not after his own likeness, but after what he feels within himself at his noblest hours, an intolerably fierce desire, or a hopeless ache of yearning to become. And if mankind be not the greatest work of God, at all events the idea of Plim shall ever con tinue to be the sublimest creation of the poetic spirit of man.
