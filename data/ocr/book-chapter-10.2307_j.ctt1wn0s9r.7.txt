After showing his passport and clearing customs, he headed towards the  airport’s Underground station where he took a train to Piccadilly Circus. Once  there he took out his smartphone, opened a navigation application that a col- league had recommended to him by saying ‘it will make you a local anywhere’,  and entered the address where he was expected within the next hour. From  there on he followed the visual and audio instructions emitted by his phone and  reached his destination in thirty- fi ve minutes. With the aid of  the public trans- port network and its information maps as well as with the smartphone, the navi- gation application, and its instructions, Prof. Smith felt confi dent that he would  arrive at his destination in good time for the PhD defence. In fact, his colleague’s  statement was right: an observer would not have noticed he was foreign to the  city although this was his fi rst visit. The trip was an easy one. Only four hours  earlier he had woken up at his home in Hamburg, and he was now in Central  London conducting his academic business.   After the PhD defence and whilst resting at his hotel Prof. Smith had a  chance to refl ect on how smooth his journey had been and what had made it so.  He thought fi rst of  the security aspects of  it, of  how he had to demonstrate via  documents and inspections that he was a good citizen and a safe traveller. The  way in which he had been security- checked at the airport in Hamburg and had  been asked to identify at passport control when travelling to a country outside  the Schengen Agreement were for him examples of  forms of  sovereign security  (cf. Edkins et al.  2004 ). He also had to provide some information to his airline  in advance so they could check that he was not on a restricted travel list. Had  any of  his data matched a profi le that the technology had been set to identify,  his case would have raised a fl ag and more questions would have followed (see  Hagmann and Dunn Cavelty  2012 ). He also had to alert his employer, by com- pleting a form, that he would be travelling for academic business to a different  17  </page> <page sequence="4"> 18 Prologue country. If  the country was considered to be of  high risk, meaning outside the  generally agreed liberal world, this might not be covered by the employer’s lia- bility insurance under normal terms and the university might have had to ask  him not to travel or seek appropriate cover. That constituted for him a case of   risk- based security (cf. Aradau et al.  2008 ; Muller  2008 ; Amoore and De Goede   2008 ; O’Malley  2004 ), which contrasted with the way in which sniffer dogs  at the luggage reclaim area of  the airport had smelt his luggage, searching for  unauthorised goods or substances. He also observed the CCTV cameras that  recorded all his movements from the airport to the university, the posters and  announcements that alerted travellers to report any unaccompanied luggage  or suspicious behaviour, and the police offi cers in high- visibility jackets, but by  this time he was too tired to make up his mind as to what exact form of  security  these represented (e.g., Rasmussen  2004 ; Bigo and Tsoukala  2008 ; Stephens  and Vaughan- Williams  2008 ).   By the time he began to think about the mobility elements that had made  his journey so easy, he was already falling asleep. If  he had kept awake, he would  have had to think about the politics, logistics, and economics involved in inter- national air travel (cf. Salter  2008 ), in planning cities, in designing, upgrading,  and operating the urban transport systems so that places could be connected  and in which ways, on the technologies involved in making digital pocket navi- gation applications possible, and the politics, economics, and socialities at play  in allowing such instruments and technologies to be available to the everyday  person. Had that not made him dizzy already, he could have gone deeper, refl ect- ing on how his particular way of  life, that of  a liberal academic working in a  Western European country producing and authorising forms of  knowledge that  liberal societies, governments, and industries demand, depends on him being  able to connect almost seamlessly with ideas, goods, services, and people, within  spaces made (liberally) secure through a plethora of  security technologies and  practices (cf. Muller  2009 ). In sum, he would have been able to realise that what  makes his life liberal is a particular form of  connectivity that requires the secure  mobility of  all those elements. Needless to say that, had he remained awake,  thinking about the digital dimensions of  his security and mobility would have  led to permanent insomnia through refl ections on what his connectivity had to  say about liberal subjectivity.   Meanwhile, in a completely different historical setting, Hans Emius, 1  a friar  and scholar from the city of  Munster, began in the spring of  1590 his pilgrim- age to Jerusalem and the biblical lands. Although he had never travelled fur- ther than a hundred miles, infl uenced by the study of  M. Henricum Bünting’s   Itinerarium Sacræ Scripturæ (Bünting  1587 ) he had a rough idea of  the regions  he would travel through and to, and the distances between them. In Bünting’s  book, fi rst published in Magdeburg in 1581, he had been able to examine neatly  compiled tables listing the journeys of  the biblical characters together with the  18  </page> <page sequence="5"> 19 Connectivity as problem distances between the places they travelled. Bünting even provided conversions  of  those distances into German miles that helped Emius get a rough idea of  the  time his pilgrimage would take; it would be a very long journey. A fellow friar had  heard Bünting talk about his work years before and had recommended the book  to Emius, stating that it provided a most reliable compilation of  biblical travels.  Since distant travel at the time was not customary, aids for travellers were scarce  and detailed knowledge of  remote places was valuable. With his faith in God and  relying on the scriptures as well as the geographical guidance of  Bünting, Emius  set off  knowing that the journey would be dangerous and tortuous. However,  the purpose of  his trip justifi ed it all, it was for him a moral and spiritual duty to  visit Jerusalem and spread the word of  God. But his legs ... well, they had until  now been an impediment to the journey.   Refl ecting on what a traditional journey of  this kind would entail, he  thought that on the way he would rely on his community of  faith to provide him  with shelter, food, information, and spiritual comfort. He would try to organise  his journeys so that he could reach places where he would seek the support of   the local church or fellow Christians. When possible he would try to travel with  Christians and through Christian territories and settlements. At times he would  seek the protection of  those who would provide it. He would use his Latin as the   lingua franca of  educated people and would carry some gold as universal cur- rency. As long as he could keep within the known markers of  his faith, he would  feel secure. In his actual journey, the one he began to conduct with the help of   Bünting, none of  these issues should be a problem. The kind of  mobility involved  rested on a new imaginary of  travel which is detailed later.   Both our friar and our professor shared a concern for security. Their secu- rity, however, differed in principle, or to put it better, they differed at the level of   rationality, understood here as that which enshrines the principles of  formation  of  an apparatus. The principles of  formation on which Emius’s security oper- ated differed starkly from those of  Smith’s. Whereas the ultimate principle for  Emius’s security was to serve and please God and His will, which in this case was  to travel to the Holy Land, the principle for Smith’s security was to remain free to  be a liberal subject, which involved in his case to produce and sanction (liberal)  knowledge by, for example, examining doctoral theses. The security of  our friar  derived from working towards the salvation of  his soul, an arduous and continu- ous task. The security of  our professor was that of  his liberal freedom. In both  cases, however, mobility was deeply interlinked with security and this interlink- age could be observed through the kind of  connectivity that characterised their  Christian and liberal life.   These two hypothetical cases highlight an issue at the core of  contemporary  critical security studies. Mobility is not simply a phenomenon through which  to analyse how to provide security more effectively and more thoroughly. Both  mobility and security are phenomena that relate to the specifi cities of  forms of   19  </page> <page sequence="6"> 20 Prologue life. In both the cases of  Prof. Smith and Friar Emius, their ways of  life rely on  forms of  mobility and forms of  security that promote and protect the values on  which they operate. Whereas the security of  individuals within the European  Union is expected to take a liberal form, the security of  Christianity relied on the  preservation of  the core values of  a community of faith.   To speak of  a liberal or a Christian way of  life is of  course an intellectual  generalisation (cf. Dillon and Lobo- Guerrero  2009 ). When what is taken to be a  specifi c liberal or Christian life within a particular historical period and region is  analysed in its details, it becomes possible to observe that each way of  life requires  and thrives on very particular forms of  mobility and security. Just as it is not pos- sible to speak of  a liberal way of  life in general, forms of  mobility and security  are expressions of  how individuals and collectives understand their being in the  world in relation to movement and danger. They will change as understandings  of  life change over time.   Although mobility and security respond to different logics, the former to  one of  position and movement and the latter to a logic of  danger, they are both  related to understandings of  space and power as expressions of  lived lives. As  noted by Peter Adey ( 2009 : xvii), mobility is ‘a lived relation, an orientation  to oneself, to others and to the world’. Security is understood here as related  to the form of  life in need of  promotion and protection (Dillon and Lobo-  Guerrero  2008 ). As characterised by relationality, the confl uence between  mobility and security can be observed in how forms of  life are connected,  the forms of  connectivity that characterise them, and their understandings  of  connectedness. Such understandings will leave historical registers in the  form of  lived experience. These registers can be explored as empirical sites, as  demonstrated below.   Before proceeding, we need to note that connectivity is never an abstract  issue. It relates to how worlds are imagined and made, and imagination and  crafting are power- imbued practices that should be taken as subjects of  inves- tigation. Connectivity is therefore an expression of  power relations. How peo- ple connect and what makes connections possible are the result of  the effective  interaction of  a myriad elements that need to be combined in strategic ways.  The case of  early modern practices of  European mapping and atlas- making in  the sixteenth century attests to this. In these practices, for example Bünting’s   Itinerarium Sacræ Scripturæ (henceforth Itinerarium), the mapping of  connec- tivities is also the mapping of  a theography that resembles a particular Christian  imaginary of  Europe and of  the Christian life of  educated people.   In what follows, this chapter takes Bünting’s Itinerarium to explore three  specifi c issues. First, how the imagination of  security and mobility relate to  understandings of  how things, ideas, and beliefs are connected. Second, how  material and discursive manifestations of  security relate to the forms of  author- ity they enact and/ or legitimate. And third, how the framing of  the imagination  20  </page> <page sequence="7"> 21 Connectivity as problem of  security and mobility structures the production of  subjectivity. The relevance  of  examining these three issues through this very particular historical travel  book is to provide a contrast to, and hopefully disrupt, contemporary liberal  security analyses conducted within the loose academic framework of  critical  security studies.   Mapping the biblical world   In Bünting’s Itinerarium security and mobility relate through the biblical  portrayal of  the world in which humans (must) live. The world, therefore, is  conceived as the creation of  a creator, called God, who pre- arranged and pre-  determined this. Accordingly, Bünting’s treatise relates security and mobil- ity to a world in which humans (must) live together with other creatures and  things according to an arrangement, the fi xation of  which stems from God. Yet,  humans are conceived as relating to the world and its biblical (hi)story – i.e. the  narrative or story of  the historical coming into being of  the world, including all  of  its creatures and things – by mental processes, namely, imagination and expe- rience (Bünting  1587 : Advertisement to the reader). As a biblical or ‘scriptural  geography’2   (Aiken  2009 : 1), which, literally, shows the way to the Promised  Land, among other things, Bünting’s treatise is meant to serve as a manual or  script for worship and pilgrimage leading to Salvation. To this end, the treatise  presents maps and explanations, as well as travel reports of  the biblical charac- ters, which together reconstruct the place and ‘places in which the story, or the  narrative, of  the Bible takes place’ (Aiken  2009 : 1), and translates the biblical  world in terms of  the biblical (hi)story.   In the following, we elaborate on the world as constituted by the maps and  text in the fi rst volume of  Bünting’s Itinerarium and discuss the implications of   this world view for the relation between security and mobility. In doing so, we  conceive of  Bünting’s treatise as an attempt to intervene in the conception of   the world and produce subjectivities such as that of  our fi ctitious Friar Emius  travelling to and in the Promised Land.   Bünting’s treatise accepts the truth of  the Bible as an instance of  the ‘extraor- dinary / sublime / great grace / gift and welfare / of  the pious and faithful God  / ... his ... revealed word’ (Bünting  1587 : Advertisement to the reader, transl.  Friederike Kuntz (FK)). The topology of  the world, as well as life and events in its  interior, are thus presented as grounding in God and as deriving their meaning  from the same source. Given that Bünting was Vicar (P farrherr)  to and a subject  of  the Duke and Master of  Brunswick and Lüneburg, as the treatise indicates  (Bünting  1587 : Dedication to Duke and Master, transl. FK),3   this view of  the  world seemed to have come naturally to him. Yet, drawing on the Bible for the  constitution of  the world has costs for the thus constituted world and the rela- tion between security and mobility applying to and in this.  21  </page> <page sequence="8"> 22 Prologue  To start with, based on the Bible, the world is constituted in Bünting’s trea- tise as having three parts grouped around a centre, the latter being Jerusalem  and, more generally, the Promised Land. As the treatise frankly acknowledges,  in doing so, it neglects America or ‘the new world’, which, however, seems to  be acceptable as America is not mentioned in the Bible as part of  the world  (Bünting  1587 : 7). The treatise, furthermore, counts all of  the distances indi- cated on its maps in relation to Jerusalem and zooms in on and unfolds the  world by following the chronology of  the biblical (hi)story (apparently), turning  after the presentation of  maps of  the world and its parts to such cartographic  motifs as the Exodus from Egypt (Bünting  1587 : 29– 30). Most important for the  relation between security and mobility, however, is the point where Bünting’s  treatise begins its reconstruction and re- narration of  the world of  the biblical  (hi)story. Unsurprisingly, this starting point is ‘[t] he place / where the fi rst  human Adam was made / and created by God of  red soil’ (Bünting  1587 : 71,  transl. FK). According to the treatise, this place was called ‘Paradise’ and was  eradicated from the surface of  the world by ‘the Deluge’, punishing Adam’s and  Eve’s sin (Bünting  1587 : 71, transl. FK).   Bünting’s treatise does not only gain from the Bible its account of  the world  and the fi rst humans that had to live and wander in this world. Most impor- tantly, Bünting’s treatise gains from the Bible an account of  the present world  as having originated in human sin and divine punishment, that is, a (hi)story of   alienation of  humans from God. 4  However, the treatise also nourishes hope for  humans’ reconciliation with God when humans live piously in the world, which  is framed as bringing eternal life and rest in the Heavenly Paradise (Bünting  1 587:   258). The world of  Bünting’s treatise is thus situated after ‘[t]h e fi rst  Paradise’ and long after the biblical (hi)story, ‘[t]he other Paradise’ being con- sidered ever since only ‘at God or in heaven’ (Bünting  1587 : 71, transl. FK). In  other words, the world of  humans – i.e. the earth – is divided from and referred  back to heaven, where the promise of  eternal life and happiness awaits those  who qualify on earth for this grace and reward granted by God in exchange for  a pious life. As a result, the movement and mobility of  humans in the world  are related to the security of  ‘[t]he other Paradise’ (Bünting  1587 : 71, transl.  FK). Yet, this security needs to be undertaken as a constant effort by humans to  secure their entrance cards to this Paradise in heaven while living in the world  by following the ways and examples of  the biblical characters, in a transferred  sense. Thus, the movement and mobility of  humans in the world is marked  by divine punishment and yet holds as well the promise of  Salvation, which  is presented, in turn, as a departure from this world to a place of  eternal life  and rest. Bünting’s treatise, therefore, does not only construe the world and the  signifi cance and basic parameters of  human life and existence in it in accord- ance with the Bible as being ordered and fi xed. The treatise also addresses and,  thus, construes its readers as being in charge of  the security of  their entrance  22  </page> <page sequence="9"> 23 Connectivity as problem cards to ‘[t]he other Paradise’ (Bünting  1587 : 71, transl. FK), as it were, and  as creatures that relate to their world by the medium of  their minds. Thus, the  treatise tasks its readers to make sense of, follow, and implement the ways and  example(s) of  the biblical characters presented to them, while attributing to  them the faculties to do so. For the relation between mobility and security this  implies that humans are called upon to become active in securing their eternal  life and rest by living a pious life. Yet, for this, humans need to comprehend the  biblical (hi)story of  their world and its implications for (their) life. And, to this  end they need to imagine and grasp this fi rst in its true materiality, that is, as  the world together with the lay of  the land, distances, sites, and places, as well  as (fi rst) humans and events. Therefore, the treatise’s concern is to assist and  support humans in imagining and grasping the biblical (hi)story of  their world  in its true extent.   Next to the pre- arranged and pre- determined relation between security and  mobility in terms of  world and heaven, Bünting’s treatise constitutes a relation  between security and mobility in the world that humans must secure by means  of  their movement, as it were. To comprehend the signifi cance and implications  of  all of  this from the Bible, humans need to be shown a reconstruction and  description of  the biblical topology and geography as well as the characters,  deeds, and events taking place in them corresponding to the Bible. Yet, what  is more, all of  this needs to be translated truthfully and correctly for humans  following the content and signifi cance given to it in the Bible. Together, these  two issues are needed for humans to imagine and grasp the true extents of  the  biblical (hi)story of  the world and its implications for their life and existence in  the world.   The actual full title of  Bünting’s treatise – as seen in  fi gure 1  – is ‘Itinerarium  Sacræ Scripturæ That is / A Travel Book, about the entire holy Scripture / divided  into two Books.’ (Bünting  1587 : Title, transl. FK). The title goes on to specify:  The fi rst part / covers [and/ or grasps] all travels of  the beloved Patriarchs / Judges /  Prophets / Princes / etc. calculated according to German Miles / and the Lands / Cities  [and/ or locations, sites] / Water[s] / Mountain[s] and Valley[s] / thought of  [and/ or  remembered] in the holy Scripture / Described according to all opportunity [and/ or  circumstances, and/ or situatedness] and form / and Germanizing their Hebraic and  Greek names / with attached short Allegories and Spiritual signifi cances.  (Bünting   1587 : Title, transl. FK)   The second or ‘Other [part]’, in contrast, ‘goes to the New Testament / and  indicates / how the Virgin Maria / Joseph / the Wise from the Orient / the LORD  Jesus Christus / and the beloved Apostles have travelled / collected by means of   the most trustworthy and noblest Books and calculated in Geometrical man- ner’ (Bünting  1587 : Title, transl. FK). It is announced, furthermore, that the  treatise is ‘augmented’ by a ‘small’ book on the money and measures featuring  in the Bible (Bünting  1587 : Title, transl. FK).5   The treatise’s engagement with  23  </page> <page sequence="10"> 24 Prologue  Figure 1  Cover of  Bünting’s treatise.  24  </page> <page sequence="11"> 25 Connectivity as problem measures and translations already in its title underscores the idea that humans  are capable of  imagining and grasping the biblical (hi)story of  the world in  which they live. Measures and translations are not simple tools to adapt biblical  history to each and every individual experience. It presupposes, instead, a con- frontation of  lives and experiences with a truthful and correct image of  what a  Christian life should be, according to the Bible.   Altogether, Bünting’s treatise, its maps, and travel reports are a glossary- like  instrument having the function of  assisting humans in imagining and grasping  the biblical (hi)story of  the world they still (must) inhabit to make them com- prehend its signifi cance and implications for their way of  life in the world. By  the same token, from the vantage point of  the treatise, humans appear as being  capable of  imagining and understanding this (hi)story only if  and when this  is truthfully and correctly translated and transcribed onto the surface of  the  earth. Doing so, supposedly, the treatise crafts and charts a truthful image of  the  biblical world and calls this into a fl eshly existence in (biblico- )historically and  geographically correct form, thus allowing humans to form a truthful idea of  it  which, in turn, helps them to understand its signifi cance and implications for  human life.   Mapping and measuring the biblical world   The world, as well as the geographical translation and re- narration of  its  (hi)story, which are thus presented in Bünting’s treatise, claim their truthfulness  and authority based on a mixture of  fundamentals: the Bible; truthful methods  of  the translation of  measurements of  distances and names, and explanations  of  biblical characters and their (hi)story, etc.; fi nally, truthful reports of  pious  and trustworthy travellers to and in the Holy Land. All of  these fundamentals  are central for the truth of  the projected image and, therefore, to the idea that  readers can imagine and grasp. Based on these fundamentals, Bünting’s trea- tise translates, measures, and reconstructs the biblical world and (hi)story in  a truthful and correct way according to biblical (hi)story, and, in doing so, pro- ceeds in four steps.   It begins by showing the already- mentioned maps of  the world with its three  parts (see  fi gure 2 ), centred around Jerusalem, the Holy Land, and the travel  of  ‘the children of  Israel out of  Egypt’ (Bünting  1587 : 29– 30, transl. FK), etc.  Secondly, it explains to its readers the maps as well as the method by means of   which it translates and calculates the measures, distances, and locations fea- turing in the Bible. Thirdly, it offers a map and description of  the Holy City of   Jerusalem at several points in time (see  fi gure 3 ) – for example, before its second  destruction, in the then present. Finally, the treatise assembles and recounts the  travels of  the main characters of  the books of  the Old Testament. In so doing, it  starts, as indicated, with God’s creation of  Adam and the once earthly location  25  </page> <page sequence="12"> 26 Prologue  Figure 2  Bünting’s map ‘The Whole World in a Cloverleaf ’ (1587: 4– 5).  of  the fi rst Paradise before the fall. In its presentation of  the travel reports of   the biblical characters, the treatise seems to follow the order of  the books of  the  Old Testament. The travel reports begin mostly with a list and a sum total of  the  distances the respective character travelled. They further comprise descriptions  of  sites, translations of  names, and explanations of  events and deeds associ- ated with the character, as well as of  their allegorical and spiritual signifi cance,  though this latter does not hold for all the accounts. Sites and cities already dealt  with are indicated, but descriptions and explanations are not repeated.   The treatise’s emphasis on truthful and correct measurement and trans- lation shows that a truthful and correct imagination and grasp of  the biblical  world and its (hi)story are not considered possible without them. At the same  time, based on such measurement and translation, Bünting’s treatise also seeks  to ensure the intelligibility of  the biblical world and (hi)story, and its reproduc- tion of  them, and so claims its own usefulness, inter alia. In relation to the meth- ods used, the Bible, as ‘the’ testimonial of  God’s will and word is and remains  the fi rst fundament of  the world. It provides a description of  the world as well  as information on its origin, and distances and locations in it. Yet, to make sense  for humans, all this needs to be translated into a language familiar to them.  Methodologically speaking, this means the world described in the Bible needs  to be imagined and drawn in accordance with the measures it uses. However,  26  </page> <page sequence="13"> 27 Connectivity as problem  Figure 3  Bünting’s map of  the Holy City of  Jerusalem (1587: 37– 8).  to be imaginable and graspable, these need to be translated into more familiar  measures – in particular, German, but also French and Walloonian (Welsch),  miles. In the text of  its explanation of  its method, Bünting’s treatise refers to  names such as ‘Gualtherus H.  Riuius’, ‘Doctor Martinus Luther’, ‘Greek and  Latin historians’, including ‘Strabo’ and ‘Hieronymus’, and to names such as  ‘Ptolomeum ... Palaestinam’, etc. (Bünting  1587 :  31– 3). On its fi rst pages it  shows, furthermore, a list displaying ‘the noblest authors’ used in it (Bünting   1587 :  ‘The noblest authors based on whom the work is put together’, transl.  FK). Yet, in spite of  all of  those names, the translation of  the biblical measures  into more familiar ones actually is more an assertion of  common knowledge,  and is not introduced by explicit reference to any of  the just- mentioned names.6    The text states, for example:  [O] ne stage [or degree] of  heaven / comprises fi fteen German miles on earth. Four  minutes make a German mile. One minute makes a fourth of  one German mile. ...  The Holy Evangelists ... count by means of  Stadia. ... One stage [or degree] covers  four hundred and eighty Stadia on earth / from which it follows / that thirty and two  Stadia make one German mile. One minute of  heaven covers eight Stadia on earth /  which make a forth of  a German mile (Bünting  1587 : 31, transl. FK)  27  </page> <page sequence="14"> 28 Prologue  Besides the Bible, understood as ‘the’ testimonial of  God’s will and word,  the method on which Bünting’s treatise claims its authority and truthfulness  basically consists of  a translation of  biblical measures into familiar measures  and a calculation of  distances and locations mentioned in the Bible along  these lines.   For further clarifi cation regarding sites and locations mentioned and  described as part of  its attempt to remap and recount the biblical (hi)story of   the world, not only scholarly works but also eyewitness reports of  travellers to  and in the Holy Land are drawn upon. For instance, Bernhard von Breitenbach  is referred to, inter alia, for a description of  Mount Sinai (Bünting  1587 : 97) and  the claim that in the city of  Memphis ‘there are so many people / as are around  in Italy or Wallonia [Welschland]’ (Bünting  1587 : 160).   In short, the world constituted in Bünting’s treatise depends not only on  the Bible as a testimonial of  God’s will and word. It also depends on a method  allowing for a supposedly truthful translation of  measures used in the Bible in  relation to the world, allowing, in turn, a reconstruction and calculation of   the distances and locations in the Bible in familiar terms. Together the Bible  and the method of  translation applied to it provide the basis for the (claimed)  truthfulness of  the presented world. The purpose of  the thus supposedly truth- ful and intelligible reconstruction of  the world in which humans live and  of  its (hi)story is to assist and guide humans in imagining and grasping the  two, when reading the Bible, and comprehending thus their implications and  signifi cance. The maps, their explanations, the explication of  the method of   measurement, the translations, and so on serve thus a didactic purpose, fi rst  and foremost.   Cartography and human imagination   The didactic purpose of  Bünting’s Itinerarium shows particularly in the maps’  fi gurative form, for which the treatise is probably best known among geogra- phers and art historians.7   For instance, the portrayal of  the world as a three-  leafed clover (Bünting  1587 : 4– 5), which is the fi rst map, is introduced, inter  alia, as a form that corresponds to the three parts into which the world is divided  (Bünting  1587 : 6) and thus helps ‘the common man ... in learning to under- stand the lay of  the earth’ (Bünting  1587 : 6, transl. FK). The treatise indicates  as well, however, that the form of  the earth does not correspond to the cloverleaf   in every regard (Bünting  1587 : 6). Both the correspondence and discrepancy  between the world and its portrayal in the form of  a cloverleaf  are underscored  by the map entitled ‘the actual and true form of  the earth and the sea’ (Bünting   1587 :  8– 9, transl. FK) following the map entitled ‘the world in a cloverleaf ’  (Bünting  1587 :  4– 5, transl. FK).8   The two fi gurative portrayals of  Europe in  female form – or ‘IN FORMA VIRGINIS’ as the text says (Bünting  1587 :  13,  28  </page> <page sequence="15"> 29 Connectivity as problem emph. in orig.) – and of  Asia as Pegasus function similarly. Against the backdrop  of  the world map entitled ‘the actual and true form of  the earth and the sea’  (Bünting,  1587 : 13), the shape of  Europe is presented, for instance, as lending  itself  to a comparison with ‘a virgin lying down’ (Bünting  1587 : 7, our transl.),  and the fi gurative portrayal of  Europe that implements this correspondence  is stylised as assisting humans in ‘imagining the lay of  the whole of  Europe’  (Bünting  1587 : 14, our transl.):  The head [of  Europe] / as you [can] see / is Hispania and right above in the crown  / lays Lusitania otherwise called Portugal. The right ear is Aragon / and on the left  ear / one has the kingdom Navarra / The breast of  this Europe is Gallia or France /  there one fi nds as well the royal city Paris. The Alps or mountains of  the Alps / and  the river Rhine / equate chains that Europe wears on the neck / and the Bohemian  Forrest / together with the entire kingdom Bohemia / is like a golden cent / or like  a round hanger and treasure / having been hung on the chains of  the river Rhine /  by means of  the Main and the Hardtwald / as if  by means of  golden joints and silver  robes. ... The mountains Albani / and the water Danubius / otherwise called the  Danube / are like long belts and bodily chains / hanging down to the food. See thus  [,] by means of  this portrayed Europe / you can imagine yourself  / the lay of  the  whole of  Europe.  (Bünting  1587 : 14, our transl.)   The fi gurative maps or portrayals of  the world and of  its parts9   do not  pretend thus to correspond point for point to the real world and its parts.  But they pretend to correspond suffi ciently to the real world so as to be able  to serve humans as aides- memoire with a view to the geography and topol- ogy of  the world. That there is suffi cient correspondence between the fi gura- tive maps and the real world is demonstrated by the map entitled ‘the actual  and true form of  the earth and the sea’ (Bünting  1587 : 14) on the basis of   which the female form of  Europe is rationalised, as is the centre of  the world  in Jerusalem.   Next to the maps of  the world and its parts, the translation of  the measures  used in the Bible for distances and locations is also a device designed to help  humans imagine and understand the biblical (hi)story. By being recounted in  German miles, distances and locations in the Holy Land become intelligible, as  do the travels and the loads of  the biblical characters. As it is put in ‘the [second]  preface by the author’:  When following this guide of  ways and travel book / the holy Land / and also all other  Lands / which are not remembered in the holy Scripture / become so [well] known /  as if  you had roamed around in them / and had seen them with your own eyes.   (Bünting  1587 : 2, transl. FK)   Thus, by providing a supposedly truthful reconstruction of  the world, its  parts, the Holy Land, and the Holy City of  Jerusalem and an explanation of   methods used to this end, Bünting’s treatise seeks to underscore its own author- ity in teaching humans to imagine and grasp the signifi cance and implications  29  </page> <page sequence="16"> 30 Prologue of  the biblical (hi)story. The fi gurative maps, on the one hand, are grounded in  the Bible and function as aides- memoire given their suffi cient correspondence to  the world. German versions of  measures and names, on the other hand, trans- late conditions that in the Bible feature in another language. Both the aides-  memoire and the translations are geared to and address we humans’ minds, and  seek to facilitate, inter alia, readings of  the Bible as well as the comprehension of   its signifi cance and implications.   Yet, the treatise goes deeper into framing the subjectivity of  its readers by  way of  colonising their imagination. As noted earlier, the largest portion of  the  treatise recounts and lists the travels of  biblical characters. In so doing, it also  gives an account of  deeds and events associated with them and describes the fea- tured places and sites. Often, but not in every case, the treatise explains as well  the spiritual signifi cance of  the discussed biblical character. A case in point and  model account is the report and description of  Abraham’s travels:  MASTER Abraham travelled from his fatherland / from Ur in Chaldea / until the  city Haran in Mesopotamia / eighty and four miles / Gene. 11 / From Haran he  travelled by God’s order to Sichem / a hundred miles / From Sichen he travelled  through the forest More / to the mountain between Bethel and Ali / seven miles ...  From the forest Mamre Abraham travelled in the direction of  Dan / thirty and  one miles / and hit there the four Kings / that had captured Loth ... From Berseba  Abraham travelled with his Sara again to the forest Mamre in the direction of   Hebron / four miles / and there they died and are ... / Gen. 23. 25 / Sum of  all travels  of  the Patriarch Abraham / Four hundred and forty- nine miles / Following now the  description of  cities and places / Ur / The city Ur in Chaldea / where Abraham was  born / is called Orchot in our times / as Petrus Appianus writes / and is situated one  hundred and fi fty- six miles from Jerusalem in the direction of  the sunrise. Ur means  in German a light or fi re / and might well have received its name / from the wor- ship / that one has enfl amed there fi re sacrifi ces ... The spiritual Signifi cance of  the  Patriarch Abraham / Abraham means ... Father / and thus Abraham is an image of   God the Heavenly Father / who although he is father of  many peoples / has none- theless a single Natural Son / who goes by the name of  Jesus Christus. Abraham he  loved God so much that he did not spare his own son / in turn / God loved Abraham  and the world so much / that he did not spare his sole son Jesus Christ.  (Bünting   1587 : 75– 9, transl. FK)   By recounting the travels of  the biblical characters according to this model,  the biblical (hi)story takes shape as nothing but a huge travel event. This, along  with the travel reports, gives us above all an idea of  the landscapes and the places  and parts of  the world that feature in the Bible and the Holy Land. It also explains  the spiritual signifi cance of  selected biblical characters as well as the quality of   their deeds and God’s reaction to them. ‘King Jojakim’, for instance, is described  as ‘a tyrant and bloodhound / who also wanted to kill the Prophet Jeremiam’  and who was killed by Nebucad Nezar whom ‘God ... had awakened’ to this end  (Bünting  1587 : 193, transl. FK).  30  </page> <page sequence="17"> 31 Connectivity as problem  Yet, more importantly, by recounting and listing the travels of  the bibli- cal characters, including the sum total of  the travelled distance(s), the trea- tise reveals their travel loads and their painstaking and restless lives, but also  the marvels and punishments associated with them. The biblical (hi)story of   Samson, for instance, who carried the gate of  Gaza on his shoulders up on to the  mountain close to Hebron, is intelligible and comprehensible as a miracle only,  as the treatise holds, when we know that Samson had to carry this gate upon his  shoulders for fi ve miles (Bünting  1587 : 2). Following this schema, the measure- ment and translation of  names of  and in the travel reports make the biblical  (hi)story imaginable and graspable for humans in terms of  the physical pains  that the lives of  humans on earth imply, but also in terms of  the divine assis- tance and promise that awaits those who travel or wander piously and patiently  on earth, and, in so doing, do good and refrain from evil.   In the end, the truthful maps and fi gurative portrayals or aides- memoire of   the world, as well as the truthful accounts of  the travels of  the biblical charac- ters, the measurement of  distances, the translations of  names, and the explana- tions of  spiritual signifi cances, etc., all help the readers to materialise the biblical  (hi)story in their minds and to comprehend by this means of  its implications  and signifi cance for their life and existence on earth. This being so, the biblical  (hi)story in Bünting’s treatise takes shape as one true (hi)story of  the world in  which humans (must) live, and as a parable of  the pains of  human life on earth  and the promise of  God in heaven. The purpose of  all of  these efforts is, as it  were, to assist and guide then contemporary humans in empathising with the  biblical characters, thus repeating their travels, to enable them to imagine and  understand the same, along with their signifi cance and implications. The func- tion of  the mapping and travel reports as parable and mental journey through  the biblical (hi)story that operate through empathising repetition is underscored  by the remarks with which the treatise ends:  And thus I have now (thanks to God) described all travels consecutively / that are  remembered in the Old Testament / by means of  which one can nicely learn / how  the holy Archfathers / Kings and Prophets / etc. have travelled occasionally in this  vale of  tears here on earth / and have accomplished some diffi cult / long and far-  reaching travels / at great pains and with much work / until the beloved God has  taken them from this miserable and painstaking life / to himself  in joyful heaven /  and thus has brought them to rest. God give to us all also once one / a blissful hour  / that we bring together with the beloved Jacob the time of  our Pilgrimage to an end  / That may give the graceful and pious God / for the sake of  his beloved Son Jesus  Christ / who has acquired us with his costly Blood /  Amen.  (Bünting  1587 : 258,  transl. FK)   As the description of  the Holy City of  Jerusalem in its then present state  underscores, such interior reconstruction and examination of  the bibli- cal (hi)story – that is, its mental and empathic re- enactment – is shown to  31  </page> <page sequence="18"> 32 Prologue readers to be the sole way to comprehend the biblical (hi)story along with  the sorely affl icted existence of  humans on earth and humans’ painstaking  pilgrimage to the New Jerusalem (that is, the Jerusalem of  the heavens), and  the way to get there. This is all the more so because, as the treatise maintains,  the sects guarding Jesus Christ’s graveside and paying tribute to the Turkish  Emperor indicate that ‘the Lord Christus must no longer be searched for in the  grave at the same place / but in his holy and saving word’ (Bünting  1587 : 70,  transl. FK).   To reach the Promised Land of  God, humans must thus travel through the  Bible and, correspondingly, through their lives and they must fulfi l in so doing  their pious and painstaking pilgrimage on earth. Bünting’s Itinerarium does  not only map and measure this biblical world of  humans and its (hi)story, along  with its places, sites, characters, travels, deeds, and events. By allowing humans  to mentally re- enact the characters’ journeys, it lets them comprehend empathi- cally the allegory or parable of  human life and the promise of  Salvation from life  on earth. Bünting’s treatise assists humans in understanding and leading their  life as part of  the Biblical life story.   Secure subjects   When Friar Emius realised that the new day was already dawning, he rubbed  the sleep from his eyes and closed with regret Bünting’s Itinerarium which he  had been reading during the night. He was tired. But he also felt content and  was confi dent that the day before him would bring good things. As he left his  room for Morning Prayer with his brothers he glanced at the book as it now lay  on his desk. In the night, he had read about ‘[t]r avels of  the ships of  Salomonis’  of  2,400 miles (Bünting  1587 : 155, transl. FK), and the ‘[t]ravel of  the Queen  of  Saba ... From Saba in Ethiopia [Morenland] / ... in the direction of  Jerusalem  / or two hundred and forty- one miles’ (Bünting  1587 : 155, transl. FK). He had  read the description of  the kingdom and city of  Saba, its true location and peo- ple, and so on with great marvel and growing astonishment. He now also had an  idea of  the geography of  the world in which the biblical characters travelled and  just how long and painful their constant journeys must have been. The maps,  the explication of  method and other explanations in the treatise had helped him  greatly with this. For the fi rst time, Emius could imagine and grasp the world  and its (hi)story in which he had to live and endure. Yet, it had been his read- ings about the fi rst Paradise on earth, and about a ‘worm’- like animal called a  crocodile living in the Nile and Ganges (Bünting  1587 : 73), that had caught his  imagination the most. The treatise had told him, as well, about another animal,  called ‘Ichmeunon’ (Bünting  1587 :  73), which was described as the natural  opponent and enemy of  the crocodile. The relation between these two animals,  32  </page> <page sequence="19"> 33 Connectivity as problem as the treatise had explained, corresponded to and translated into the strug- gle between the Devil and Jesus Christ. After his readings, Emius felt a desire to  please God and confi dence in his ability to do so. Compared to the biblical char- acters, his life seemed less hard. He would continue to live piously and patiently,  and as God had foreseen for him, to reach the Heavenly Paradise and God, and  eternal life and rest. Yet, the book had also left Emius curious. Throughout the  day, he felt a growing desire to see the Promised Land one day with own eyes,  and to live through the painful travels and harsh life of  his biblical ancestors. But  his legs ... if  only they had not had to be amputated two years before. Nowadays  he relied on crutches to move around. In spite of  this, he had, with the help of   Bünting, moved a little further towards Salvation.   In the meantime, Prof. Smith, in his hotel in London, checked emails for  information on his airline’s online check- in procedures to return to Hamburg.  After fi nalising the process and assuring himself  that he had his passport as  always in the left pocket of  his jacket, he prepared himself  for a tour of  London,  guided by his smartphone and monitored by cameras. To return to Hamburg,  he thought, he would need to go through passport control, security checks, and  customs clearance at the airport, proving once again his good liberal citizen- ship. Prof. Smith thought for a moment just how much the people in Europe  and elsewhere in the world were used to these procedures, protecting them from  others and themselves. Yet, Prof. Smith thought, he would not refl ect any fur- ther on this now. He would rather enjoy the day in London, with a good portion  of  trust in God and confi dence in himself, the people and things around him.   NOTES   1  The name and story are fi ctitious.   2  This term refers to ‘[non- fi ctional] literary works dealing with the places in which the  story, or the narrative, of  the Bible takes place’ (Aiken  2009 : 1). We rely on the term here  as we feel this helps to give an idea of  Bünting’s book.   3  The place where Bünting was Vicar is not decipherable in the edition of  the book used.   4  For a history of  diplomacy drawing productively on this bifurcation see James Der Derian  ( 1987 ).   5  This treatise is contained in the second volume of  Bünting’s treatise from 1585  (Bünting  1585 ).   6  The treatise indicates only that ‘Doctor Martinus Luther’ translated the term ‘Stadium’  into the German measure ‘fi eld road [Feldweg]’ (Bünting  1587 : 31, transl. FK and that  Gualterus H. Rivius provides insight into the number of  steps that together constitute a  Welsh, French, and/or German mile (Bünting 1587:31).   7  For examples, see, for instance, Peter Meurer ( 2008 ) and Bret Rothstein et al. ( 2014 ).   8  The three- leaved cloverleaf  neglects, on the one hand, America as a fourth part of  the  world (see ‘Mapping the biblical world’ earlier in this chapter) and it conceals, on the  other hand, that ‘the earth together with the ocean makes a round sphere’ (Bünting   1587 : 7, transl. FK).   9  It must be noted at this point that Africa, in contrast to Europe and Asia, does not appear  in a fi gurative form, nor is it explained.  33  </page> <page sequence="20"> 34 Prologue  REFERENCES   Adey ,  P. ,  2009 .
