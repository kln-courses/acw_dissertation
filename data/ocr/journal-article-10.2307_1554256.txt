A few prints and drawings by Hollar's contempo- raries, such as Robert Hooke, John Dunstall, and Fran- cis Barlow, were interwoven throughout the exhibi- tion. The group was not strong enough to provide a clear overview of the state of printmaking in England in Hollar's day, and perhaps a more valuable picture might have been created had their work been reserved for a section at the end of the show. A few of the non-Hol- lars seem to have been brought into the exhibition for quite arbitrary reasons. For example, the opening en- graving by Aegidius Sadeler of The Vladislav Hall in the Hradcany Castle, Prague (no. i) appears to have been in- cluded mainly because it happens to have been en- graved and published the year that Hollar was born in that city. The painting by the Dutch artist Claude de Jongh of The Thames at Westminster Stairs (no. 29) de- picting a deserted London (like many of Hollar's works) seemed equally gratuitous. In a few instances, the com- parisons worked to Hollar's disadvantage. His meticu- lously etched King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria (no. 34), loosely based on a painting by Anthony Van Dyck, paled when it was hung next to Van Dyck's own unfinished head of Philip, Baron Le Roy (no. 48) and Jan Lievens' riveting Portrait of an Old Man (no. 49), two of the period's most commanding portrait prints. The in- tent of etchers like Van Dyck and Lievens, who tried to capture the inner emotion of their sitters with a mini- mum of lines, was so drastically different in nature from Hollar's documentary approach that such a comparison is unfair to his efforts as a portraitist. To put Hollar more squarely into context in this period, his prints might in- stead have been juxtaposed with those of reproductive printmakers such as the De Passe family, two of whom, Simon and Willem, were active in London, or Matthias Merian, with whom Hollar trained, or even Claes Jansz Visscher in Amsterdam who, like Hollar, etched an enormous quantity and variety of subjects. Although the handsome catalogue offers few new surprises for Hollar studies, this varied and well written survey succeeds in bringing this unusual and intriguing artist to life. Nadine Orenstein Nature Observed, Nature Interpreted. Nineteenth-Century American Landscape Drawings &amp; Watercolors from the National Academy of Design and Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution. Exhibition catalogue by Dita Amory, Marilyn Symmes, et al., 1995 (National Academy of De- sign, New York; Amon Carter Museum, Fort Worth; The Detroit Institute of Arts). I67 pp.; 103 illus., several in color. In the spring of 1995 two public collections joined forces to exhibit a selection of their nineteenth-century American landscape drawings. The National Academy of Design, founded in I825, and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, founded in 1897, were among the first art institutions in New York to build collections of American drawings. The exhibition Na- ture Observed, Nature Interpreted offered an intriguing look at the work of American artists we know so well from monographic literature and exhibitions, such as Cole, Church, and Homer, as well as at that of lesser-known artists. The informative catalogue presents a good overview of the nineteenth-century landscape drawings from both collections, with short biographies and thor- ough catalogue entries documenting each drawing. Tempting as it might have been to focus exclusively on such visually exciting works as Church's Palm Trees, Jamaica (no. I5), in their selection the curators struck a fine balance between sublime views and unassuming landscape studies. As the title of the catalogue suggests, the authors were interested in exploring the juxtaposi- tion between careful observation of nature and the imagination, a central issue in nineteenth-century American art and a subject that broadly evokes the dif- ferent tendencies of British and French art of the time. Contemporary American criticism reflects these two trends; James Jackson Jarves, who believed in the paint- ing of ideas rather than facts, in spiritualism rather than materialism, stands at one pole, while Henry T. Tuck- erman stands at the other. It is English art that we see as the great influence early on in the exhibition, beginning with drawings by the early artist-explorer Alfred Thomas Agate (I812-I846; nos. I-4). In Agate's work the influence of the British topographical tradition is interpreted through the some- what conventional observations typical of expedition drawings. Largely intended to document the indige- nous peoples along with the flora and fauna, Agate em- [314 ]</page><page sequence="2">phasized reportorial skill with a view toward publica- tion. When he broke out of his programmatic wash technique and turned to pencil drawings, such as Indian Burial Place, Oregon (no. 2), there is a foreshadowing of Ruskin's dictum "truth to nature." The immediacy of his vision in this work is remarkably similar to that seen in Daniel Huntington's pencil landscapes (nos. 44, 45) or William Trost Richard's drawings of the I86os (nos. 64-66). While the closely observed, unpretentious character of these sheets suggest a Pre-Raphaelite turn of mind, the more dramatic vision of Turner appears in the mar- velous selection of works by Thomas Moran. The two drawings of the Canyon of the Virgin River, South Utah (nos. 56, 57), compelling and powerful in their sche- matic simplicity, and the awe-inspiring Viewfrom Pow- ell's Plateau (no. 58), are accompanied by more modest views by the artist. Of particular charm is the quick pencil sketch he made on the stationery of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad Company (no. 62). With the influence of Turner we move into the realm of the imagination, and the exhibition attempted to explore this world in various ways. One of the most intriguing responses to Turner is the series of twelve small pen-and-ink imaginary landscape sketches by Frederic Church. As pointed out in the introductory essay by Linda S. Ferber, these can be understood as reflecting the inspiration of Turner's Liber Studiorum. Church's sketches may be linked even more directly to Turner when we recollect that the full title of Turner's work, which was conceived as a visual treatise on land- scape art, is Liber Studiorum: Illustrative of Landscape Com- positions, viz. Historical, Mountainous, Pastoral, Marine, and Architectural, with Turner's engravings somewhat erratically divided among these categories and labeled "H," "M," and so forth, with a sixth category, "E P" (variously interpreted as Epic or Elegant Pastoral). While Church's studies generally fall into these same categories, the insertion of palm trees into one of the landscapes (no. 30) makes them personal exercises in the art of designing pictures. Samuel Isham's works done in France remind us of the growing importance of French-trained artists, and recall Jarves' characterization of French art as "the nat- ural friend and instructor of American art. . . . We can- not have too much of it." Their style, which supplanted that of the Hudson River School and Luminism, was understood to have a new spirituality, a subjective qual- ity that is alluded to in the catalogue entries for two of Isham's landscapes. Certainly this tendency becomes most evident in the landscapes of Elihu Vedder (who trained briefly in France but lived for most of his life in Italy), which come closer to a Symbolist interpretation (nos. 85, 86) than do Isham's drawings. To this re- viewer, Isham's Late Winter Landscape in charcoal (no. 48) is more evocative of Corot and earlier nineteenth- century landscape artists than of Redon's later Symbol- ist work, and his Gnarled Tree (no. 49) resembles certain anthropomorphic tree drawings by Thomas Cole. With Homer, one is encouraged to look at nature differently, and while Henry James criticized what he saw as Homer's lack of imagination, he nonetheless (al- most wonderingly) said that his art succeeded. A pencil drawing heightened with white on gray-green paper (no. 41), made when Homer was working in I878 at Houghton Farm in Mountainville, New York, is extra- ordinarily evocative of summertime, giving a new flavor to American landscape art. His drawings prove that observation and interpretation need not be mutu- ally exclusive, and Homer more than anyone else can be seen as the artist who did so much to bring these two tendencies together.
