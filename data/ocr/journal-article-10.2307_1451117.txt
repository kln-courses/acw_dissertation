<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANCIENT JEWISH ALLEGORISTS IN TALMUD AND MIDRASH BY JACOB Z. LAUTERBACH, Huntsville, Ala. IN the Talmud and in the Midrashim interpretations of scriptural passages are occasionally quoted in the name of two classes of unknown ancient teachers, called w'Wi nimwn, "Dorshe Reshumot," and nnrwn 'wnn, "Dorshe Hlamurot," respectively. We never hear anything else about them. But they must have been among the very earliest Jewish interpreters of the Scriptures, for their interpretations and sayings are mentioned in sources so remote as the older halakic Midrashim, such as Sifre and Mekilta, and Tannaites of the first and the second genera- tions are said to have explained some scriptural passages in their style and according to their exegetical method.1 But who the old exegetes were, to what school or schools they belonged, what their tendency was, what method they applied in interpreting the Scripture, and why they were 1 Many sayings of R. Jolanan b. Zakkai are described as being Ith n D', which, as we shall see, means, in the style and the method of the Dorshe HTamurot. Similarly, Joshua b. ;Iananiah and Eleazar tIisma declare a scriptural passage to be W1Wt , which, as we shall see, means that it is to T be interpreted in the method of the Dorshe Reshumot. According to Lelah. Tob on Deut. 18, 3, it is Joshua b. tIananiah who quotes the saying of the Dorshe Iamurot, which, in Sifre Deut. I65, is quoted by Judah b. Ilai, and R. Akiba quotes the saying of the Dorshe Reshumot in Kohelet r. x.

The old commentators of the Talmud, like Rashi, the Aruk, and the Tosafot, tried to explain the meaning of the appellatives "Reshumot" and "Hamurot"; following their lead, some modern Jewish scholars have advanced various theories about these ancient exegetes. But all the explana- tions hitherto given of the words "Reshumot" and "Ha- murot," and the theories based upon them by modern Jewish scholars are far from satisfactory. A correct and true opinion about them, their method, and their tendency, can be obtained only by means of careful and critical study, which should examine thoroughly the following three pos- sible sources of information: (I) The historic data, the reports about these ancient teachers, provided such are to be found in ancient Jewish literature. (2) The meaning of the names applied to them, especially of the words nroIn and nnrn forming part of these names, for it may be safely assumed that the names Dorshe Reshumot and Dorshe Hamurot were chosen to designate definitely and accurately the tendency or the method of each of the two classes of exegetes respectively. (3) The sayings and interpretations of these teachers that have been preserved, for from these sayings taken in the aggregate we should be able to abstract the method they applied in interpreting the Scriptures, the purpose they aimed at through their interpretations, and their peculiar views about the scriptural word and its meaning. Regarding the first of these three sources, namely, historical reports, none is to be found in the Talmud or in any of the Midrashim. As stated above, nothing is said about the two classes of exegetes in the talmudic-midrashic</page><page sequence="3">ANCIENT JEWISH ALLEGORISTS-LAUTERBACH 293 literature. They seem to be ignored persistently by the teachers of the traditional law, except inasmuch as some of their sayings are mentioned. Mishnah Sotah ix. 9-I5 mentions many classes of prominent men in ancient Jewry as pious men, men of faith, men of good, practical, social work; also schools of diligent students, interpreters, poets, scholars, and the time is given till when each school or group of men lived and worked, together with the name of the last of each school or class.2 We might fitly expect to find among them our two classes of interpreters of the Scriptures, with the data that are reported about the others. But they are ignored here as elsewhere. We find often that when the Rabbis of the Talmud mention an ancient name they couple with it a question about its meaning, and then proceed to explain it with more or less correctness. Or they ask why this man or that group of men was called by such and such a name, and they try to give a reason for it.3 But in the case of the Dorshe Reshumot and Dorshe HIamurot, they merely mention one or the other of these categories in quoting a saying of theirs, but they never ask: 2 The passage in the Mishnah reads thus: l1'11t1 tIySK 1Tfl 71' M1to ,Ir lptn ....pJ"n,l vintn ...polm r I11t ,. ten~,ws lWIN n 1 ,p r'i, ."pwDI ' n1tY ni Smr yn tvw 1Avv 1 tzz ow n '-I Onlt ...runo 'lo , h :H:n 'nnK ltnx 1J=Tl' T i nXn 'Zntrn a1mrtt 1'= Nl't p h*:r: tv1on 1jpDB ni3i3p. a Thus, for instance, in Sotah 47b, the question is asked ll1ty 'K kNo "what is the meaning of the name I'BJltK," and an explanation is given; ibid., 48b, the name rUS1K ''RM is explained to mean "true believers in God," and in p.

Mishnah Sotah ix. 15 asks why the name "Iatonta" was given to the last of the Hasidim, Jose, and a reason is given for it. In 1(iddushin 3oa a reason is given why the ancient teachers were called "Soferim." In Shabbat 33b a reason is given why Judah b. Ilai was designated as "the chief speaker," OVI'13iO' tWI'1; and many other similar explanations of names are found in the Talmud.</page><page sequence="4">294 THE JEWISH QUARTtRLY REVIEW nnrn lwnl 'K or rlnmwn Nnr ^T, "What or who were the Dorshe Reshumot or the Dorshe Hamurot?'; nor do they attempt to explain the meaning of the names, and why certain teachers were called by them, w KinpJ n,[l nrinrn ' ,n'lwn ', as they do in connection with other names. It would seem that by the end of the second century or thereabouts the rabbis felt a certain resentment towards these ancient exegetes, their method, and their tendency, and they quoted their sayings only reluctantly. Although their utterances were preserved, and their method was well known, and occasionally even followed by the rabbis of the first half of the third century,4 they purposely avoided giving any account of them, and sought rather to let them fall into oblivion. But if the first source of information, direct historical reports, fails us, the other two means of ascertaining the character of these ancient exegetes and who they were are still available. We know at least the names by which they were called, and happily sayings of theirs have been pre- served to us. These two sources of information are so intimately connected with each other that they are practically one and the same. For, as was said above, their names must have been applied to these teachers, because they were characteristic of their peculiar method and their tendency, both of which should be deducible by an examination of the sayings preserved to us.

In other words,a theory to be helpful,must explain satisfactor- ily the etymological meaning of the names, and show that they express a special tendency or a special method, and it must furthermore prove that every single interpretation handed down to us in the name of the Dorshe Reshumot and Dorshe Hamurot actually shows the tendency or the method supposed from the evidence given by the names themselves to have been characteristic of them. No such theory has been offered by any one of the scholars5 who have written about our ancient exegetes. None advanced by the mediaeval and the modern Jewish writers offers a correct etymological definition of the words nlilIn and nrin. And again, the method which, accord- ing to one or other of these various theories, is supposed to have been characteristic of these ancient exegetes, can be shown at most only in a few of their sayings, and in none with convincing clearness. The theory advanced in the present article seems to satisfy all the demands enumerated above. In any event, it is supported by all the evidence that can be derived from 5 Observations about the Dorshe Reshumot and Dorshe Famurot have been made by Rashi, the Aruk, and the Tosafot; by Hamburger, Real- Encyclopddie, II, 52, s. v.

It offers a characteristic mark of the method peculiar to our anonymous interpreters of the Scriptures, and shows clearly that this method has been used in each and every one of their say- ings. It gives a satisfactory explanation of the etymological meaning of the words Reshumot and Hamurot, which form their names, and shows that these names were chosen aptly to characterize the peculiarity of these exegetes, since they convey adequately the method applied by them in inter- preting the Scripture. The present theory is, besides, con- firmed by what is known about these ancient Jewish interpreters of the Scripture from reliable sources outside of the Talmud and the Midrashim. Furthermore, it demon- strates that the teachers of the traditional law had sufficient cause for the resentment they felt towards these exegetes and for objecting to their tendency. Thus, finally, will be explained the persistent silence observed by the rabbis of the Talmud about these ancient interpreters of the Scripture, and why only a few6 of their interpretations have been preserved in the talmudic-midrashic literature. The hypothesis advanced by Rashi7 and accepted by the majority of modern scholars, that the Dorshe Reshumot 6 Altogether we have fourteen interpretations of scriptural passages, in the name of the Dorshe Reshumot, and four sayings of the Dorshe Hamurot; to the latter must be added seven interpretations designated as being in the method of the Dorshe IFamurot 'tIn 1'03. See the complete list of these sayings quoted below. It is certain, however, that there must have been many more of their interpretations and sayings. For certain reasons the rabbis of the Talmud did not care to preserve them or mention them in the name of their originators. 7 Rashi, Berakot 24a, s. v. l1rI~ . 'l W1U, remarks Kr1m1 ri'Dlt nrBlilIn' nK', "We read Dorshe Lramurot instead of Dorshe Reshumot, but both are the same." Bacher, Terminologie, follows Rashi, and remarks, on p. 62: "Jedenfalls bezeichnen beide Alusdriicke [Dorshe Reshumot and Dorshe ,ramurot] dieselben alten Schriftausleger," and, on page I83, he mentions</page><page sequence="7">ANCIENT JEWISH ALLGORISTS--LAUTERBACH 297 and Dorshe Hamurot were two names given to one and the same class of teachers or exegetes, must be rejected as absolutely false. There is no valid reason for calling one class of teachers by two different names. If the two were one, how came they to be designated by two different names, seeing that these names were to characterize peculiar methods or special tendencies? It is evident that each of the two names must designate a special class8 of exegetes whose peculiar method or tendency it characterizes. It was merely the ignorance of the character and the tendency of the two classes of interpreters of the Scripture that made it possible to identify them with each other. The old commentators of the Talmud, unable to distinguish between the peculiarities of the two classes, believed them the nlt1lt1 W't'l', "die auch lnilln Ir'l'W genannt werden.". Zunz, GV., 336, and Kohut, Aruch, s. v., also identify the Dorshe Reshumot and Dorshe Ijamurot with each other, and neither Perles nor Weil, in their articles, 1. c., distinguish between the two classes. 8 The first, so far as I am aware, to distinguish between the Dorshe Reshumot and Dorshe FLamurot and to recognize them as two distinct classes of exegetes was Hamburger. He remarks in his Real-Encyclopaidie, II, 52; "Es werden zwei Klassen von Schiftforschern genannt: die Forscher der Andeutungen, ltZIlttN'~1 SI'i, und die Forscher des buchstib- lichen Textes, lImlln t'lI, , von denen Erstere sicherlich Allegoristen waren." Weiss also distinguished between the two; he gives of each one of them a different definition. The Dorshe Reshumot he describes as allegorists, IlMZll t'I 1 l1l p f'1,1 tvp ']I'? 1 wv 1nlnn Dor, I, 202; and oNII to2 l nM1s9l h2 w 1tn a j plgrDn iwr-iwt osnrnn m an miniiti trmin mn1'i nrt i y 1 t: ' an ?ttw 'U3, Middot Soferim on Mekilta, 53. The Dorshe Iramurot, on the other hand, he describes as those who seek to give a reason for the law, il'ln lZr,i D';l nn/ p i r ':t z13 '111z itPInn (Dor., 1. c.), or those interpreters whose method was the "measure for measure" rule, M'I 1 3 m t11n 1' D?

This mistaken identification of two distinct classes of exegetes had the fatal consequence that the later teachers and copyists of the Talmud would often substitute one name for the other, and the result of interchanging the two names is confusion and lack of uniformity in the readings in the various editions and manuscripts of the works with which we are concerned. A saying ascribed to the Dorshe Reshumot in a given work is sure to be quoted in another edition, or in a manuscript of the same work, in the name of the Dorshe Hamurot, or vice versa. It must be admitted that the two classes of exegetes were in one respect like each other. Their common char- acteristic was that they both interpreted the Scriptures in an allegorical sense, not according to the plain and literal meaning of the words. Nevertheless, though both were allegorists, they were absolutely distinct from each other- in origin, motive, and tendency, as well as in the method each applied in the interpretation of scriptural passages. Thus it was just that each class should be called by a special name, to distinguish it from the other. We shall now proceed to show the different methods, tendencies, and origins of the two classes of allegoristic interpreters of the Scripture. We shall treat them sepa- rately, and we begin with the Dorshe Reshumot. The definition of Dorshe Reshumot, given by Rashi' and accepted by Bacher, 1. c., 184, as "interpreters of those difficult passages in the Scriptures which are unclear in the 9 berakot 24a, millnt 1:z91Sxn MIMnDnli Qtwp i ,n2t!il ItIi11. , "the Dorshe Reshumot are the interpreters of the knots and abstruse passages contained in the Law." It is noteworthy that in Sanhedrin Io4b, Rashi describes the rl'?nZO l tr'T1' merely as 0p1DB 'W'T1, "inter- preters of verses or passages." Bacher characterizes the 10.1W'1 Mt1t'1 as "die Ausleger der undeutlichen, den Gedanken nur in Andeutungen enthal- tenden Bibelworte."</page><page sequence="9">ANCIENT JEWISH ALLEGORISTS-LAUTERBACH 299 meaning, and fail to express a thought explicitly," is abso- lutely wrong. All the scriptural passages on which inter- pretations of the Dorshe Reshumot have been preserved are very clear and distinct in the meaning of their words, and the thought, expressed by the literal meaning of their words, is far more clear and explicit than the one ascribed to them by the interpretations of the Dorshe Reshumot.' Besides, the word nlltwi cannot mean "obscure" or "difficult" passages. The singular term w1n, occurring in Mekilta, Amalek I, ed. Weiss, 6Ia, with which Bacher seeks to support this definition of niwin, has not, as he assumes, the same meaning as nDnD, "abstruse" or "unin- telligible." Although Yallut, in quoting this passage of the Mekilta, offers the reading linD instead of liwn, this does not prove that nlnD and nwiv are identical in their meanings. By substituting the word mlnD for 'wn, the Yalkut, or some copyist of it, attempted to explain the word 1lwn, the exact meaning of which he did not know. This substitute, cnnD, was suggested to him by the following word w'nn, which is often used as a contrast to nInD (comp. Bacher, 1. c., I37). He took tvnmn nltvn to be like vtni~l DnnD. But this was a misunderstanding of the mean- ing of the word ntln. The word Drln in the Mekilta passage is merely the singular form of the term nnitl used in the name n-wivn vwnin. But the phrase: nrin Np, n nlwn does not mean, as Bacher takes it, "this scriptural 10 Bacher himself felt that this definition of Dorshe Reshumot is not borne out by all their interpretations, but he thinks that at least some of their interpretations are of such a nature as to justify Rashi's and his own theory. After giving his characterization of the Dorshe Reshumot, he adds: "Wozu wenigstens ein Teil der unter ihrem Namen erhtltenen Ausspriiche stimmt" (t. c., 184). But we shall see that not even one of their sayings justifies his definition, for all the passages interpreted by them are, without exception, very explicit in their meaning.</page><page sequence="10">300 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW passage is obscure, and not distinct." It will be proved further on, where this passage of the Mekilta will be cited together with its parallel, that the phrase rIvw nrtn s'1,nn merely means: This verse of the Bible can, or is to, be considered as a wtn, that is, it can, or is to, be interpreted in the manner or according to the method of the Dorshe Reshumot. The singular form D1"i therefore in no way helps us to define the meaning of the plural form ninm n. We have to go back to the etymological meaning of the verb Dnn in order to get the correct meaning of both nouns lIrn and ninnn. The verb nw' in Hebrew and Aramaic means "to mark," "to make a sign," "to signify," or "to designate," and hence also to represent symbolically," and the noun n1l"i means, therefore, a visible "mark," "sign," or "symbol," which serves to indicate something or represents an idea or communicates some information. Such a sign or symbol does not completely describe the subject of which it is a sign, or which it is to symbolize, it merely reminds one of it or suggests it. Any word used in a figurative sense, to convey some idea or express some thought, is such a sign or symbol. The word in itself has its simple and literal meaning, yet if there is some resemblance between it and that which it is to symbolize, it can be used as a sign or a symbol for the latter. A word can be used as a sign for a certain idea, quality, or action, or state, if only one feature or one aspect of the idea, quality, action, 11 This development of the meaning of the verb ht~l can be traced also in Syriac, where the verb tl'l means delineate, designate and then also signify, represent symbolically, as in the phrase, ilt'?n K I'tt KNrK', said of the olive branch "it should represent to us the sign of peace," and K8?t?BD tl'n1 JtItW, said of a guiltless life, "it is indicated by unleavened bread" (see J. Payne Smith, A Compendious Syriac Dictionary, s. v.).</page><page sequence="11">ANCIENT JEWISH ALLEGORISTS--LAUTERBACH 301 or state, can be compared with, or represented by, it, for this one feature or this one aspect, suggested by the word, will bring to mind the whole idea, etc. For this reason, also, the first word of a sentence can be used as a sign to represent the entire sentence, as one letter of a word may be used as a sign for the whole word, since the first letter or the first word will bring to mind what followed, the whole word or the whole sentence. The name Dorshe Reshumot, accordingly, designates a certain class of exegetes, whose peculiar method was to see in the words of the Scripture signs or symbols and parabolical expressions, which should be taken in a figura- tive sense, not in their plain and literal meaning. This method was also termed 5wn, "allegoristic interpretation," to interpret the words in a metaphorical sense.12 They did not deny that the words have a literal meaning as well, and that this literal meaning is very simple, clear, and distinct. But they thought that a merely literal interpre- tation of the Scripture does not do full justice to the scriptural word, does not exhaust its meaning. For some passages of the Scripture absolutely demand, and others justify, or, at least, allow an allegorical interpretation, according to which they have a metaphorical sense, and express higher ideas than those conveyed by their simple meaning. Briefly, they were allegoristic interpreters of the Scripture, and the name nrn v 'vwni is a true character- ization of them. It expresses adequately the method 12 See Rule 26 of the Thirty-two Rules of R. Fliezer b. R. Jose Hagelili. The three interpretations given by R. Ishmael, and characterized as being according to the method of Mashal ~t= Il= (Mekilta, ed. Weiss, 88b, and Sifre Deut., ed. Friedmann, I I7b) are according to the method of the Dorshe Reshumot. They take the words not in their literal meaning, but in a figurative sense (see below pp. 328-29).</page><page sequence="12">302 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW applied by them, namely, to interpret, w'i, the words as nMIw ,13 as signs, figures, and symbols to remind us of something else than what is expressed by their literal meaning. The literal sense of a word or a passage is designated as lrtw= or lD"wnv, "according to its literal meaning." We find, accordingly, that in most places where the interpretations of the Dorshe Reshumot are mentioned, there are also mentioned other explanations, "according to the plain, literal sense", irnw, in contrast with their allegorical interpretations. As the literal meaning of the words was considered their true sense ntD, the contrast between the literal sense, characterized as nnJ, and the allegoristic or figurative sense, characterized as 'wt, or mwn, is expressed in a more drastic form in the phrases nnt nN nnt n, t n P., wN , nnt (Sanhedrin 92), or14 ,nn nNt nN nn ^ ,n5 tIwn lsN lwn(p. Yebamot I3a and Genes. r. 8I, 2), 13 The word 1'Bl?M'l in the name T11n1i'1 W?11' is not the object of l'lI and does not designate a peculiar class of passages or particular words of the Scriptures interpreted by these exegetes. It designates the peculiar method of taking the words as symbols, by which they interpreted the Scriptures. Similarly in the phrases: S'lt 1 tl 1: ttvm t'It3 1 2 l tT'I (Shebuot 37b), and 1Dt,l tWVI' (Yebamot 4a and Berakot Ioa), the words 'lB1 btl , "l l 9'at1, 1:nt~ are not the object of tyTI, but characterize the method; they do not designate the passages that are interpreted, but how, in what way, they are interpreted. 14 It was this contrast between the term lWI1, meaning, "figurative" or "allegorical sense," and the term 1t?K, meaning "literally true," that the people of Simonia had in their mind when they asked Levi to explain to them the passage in Daniel Io, 21, 1nnS W3= O1tWl1, which seemed to them to be a contradiction in terms (p. 1. c.). The explanation of this passage, which Levi afterwards gave to Judah I, '" 'I?1 t16 n8 '"?V 'Blip wIPn , corrects the opinion of the questioners, and assumes that the term tlll in Daniel io, 2I has not the same meaning which it has in the technical term O1I1, "allegorical sense." For it is characteristic of a sign or mark, wlt , that it is often made for temporary use only, liable to be changed, corrected, or rubbed off altogether. In this sense it is used in the passage in Daniel, to designate something marked or written down, which is yet doubtful and not meant to be final and permanent. And although even</page><page sequence="13">ANCIENT JEWISH ALLEGORISTS--LAUTERBACH 303 both of which phrases mean: "If you take the scriptural passage in a true, literal sense, how can you say it is its allegorical sense? And if you take it in its allegorical sense, how can you at the same time describe it as its true, literal meaning?" (see below, pp. 328-29). This theory about the Dorshe Reshumdt is thus sup- ported by the information we can derive from one source, from the etymological meaning of the words composing the name given to them. We have now to test the validity of this theory by consulting the other source of informa- tion, their sayings and interpretations. We shall quote, in the following, a complete list of all the sayings and interpretations of the Dorshe Reshumot, and in examining them we shall find that in all the method applied is the one mentioned above, and designated by the word Reshumot, namely, the method of explaining the words in a meta- phorical sense, treating them as signs and symbols for certain ideas. We shall find that some of the interpreta- tions of the Dorshe Reshumot are also found in the writ- ings of Philo, which only confirms the theory that, like the latter, the Dorshe Reshumot were allegoristic interpreters of the Scriptures. The parallels in the writings of Philo will help us sometimes to a better understanding of the sayings of the Dorshe Reshumot. For these sayings and in this sense Dlt'l forms a contrast to the term ltnK, which means some- thing "true ard lasting," yet the difficulty can be explained away by re- ferring each term to different conditions, namely, 1' 'I1TIl 'hT1j 1lt:'l, "Be- fore the sentence has been finally given and approved," the punishment it recommends is only 'ltVl, "marked down," with the possibility of being changed or blotted out, in case the sentence is not approved; '1T IlrK nnm 'i, but "after the sentence has been approved and confirmed," it is JnVK, written down as a positive, permanent, and lasting document, not subject to change or correction. Of course, in the sense which the word Dlltl has in the phrase 'l"a? 'lK1S nnRltK t: 1" l 1: lt'l, it has nothing to do with 1S'I1, lrMOi'"l, used in the name rnl1t'l 'ntr'1</page><page sequence="14">304 THt JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW interpretations of the Dorshe Reshumot have not always been preserved in their original and complete form. Some of them were condensed or shortened, and of some of them only one part has been preserved in the talmudic-midrashic literature, while the other part, left out or purposely ignored by the talmudic teachers, is to be found in Philo's works. As their method was developed gradually by the alle- goristic interpreters, I shall quote their sayings in an order that will indicate its orgin and its successive stages, how it was originally applied only to special class of scriptural passages, absolutely demanding an allegorical interpretation, how it was later on extended more and more beyond its original limits, till it came to be applied, rather excessively, to passages that could hardly bear an allegorical interpre- tation. The oldest and most original saying preserved of the Dorshe Reshumot is probably the following one in Sifre, Deut., 49, ed. Friedmann, 85a, referring to the passage in Deut. II, 22: "To walk in all His ways and to cleave unto Him." n,in mrI &amp;^* n ,n,n~ n^e ,w n :new Inr wnvti nm mmen 4Wll 'r8n'n pil' n"'ipn nam T:= nn '= n'linw.

From this saying we can learn the origin of the method of the Dorshe Reshumot, and what it was that caused them to interpret words as symbols. The passage in Deut. II, 22 was difficult to understand, as the phrase "to cleave unto Him" could not be taken literally, for, as Sifre expresses it:</page><page sequence="15">ANCIENT JEWISH ALLIGORISTS-LAUTERBACH 305 1 p:nr 11 unt10 nJllS6 1m 16S 1nW lmn n '1 "How is it possible for a human being to go up to God and cleave unto Him?". As an answer to this question, the saying of the allegoristic interpreters is quoted: In order to recog- nize God one must learn to interpret the scriptural expres- sions about Him correctly,15 that is, take them as nlln'i as figurative and allegorical expressions. In doing so, he learns to know God and realizes that the expression "to cleave unto Him" has but the meaning "to imitate Him" and "follow His ways." The original motive of the Dorshe Reshumot was to explain away all attributes inconsistent with their idea of a spiritual God. They, therefore, inter- preted all anthropomorphic expressions in the Scriptures not according to their literal meaning, but in a metaphorical sense. One of Philo's rules of allegorical interpretation is "to give up the literal meaning of a scriptural passage, if it says or implies something about God which, according to our pure conception of Him, is not becoming."'6 We should not think, however, that the Dorshe Reshumot were influenced by Philo or other Alexandrian allegorists. They were Palestinian teachers, and they de- veloped their method of allegorical interpretation inde- pendent of external influences.

The Dorshe Reshumot say that the meaning of the two verses (Exod. 23, 27-28) is: If you curse [or despise] the judge, you will bring a curse upon your grain. Preceding this saying of the Dorshe Reshumot, the Mekilta d. R. Simon (ibid., 152) quotes one by R. Eliezer b. Jacob, which takes the word "Elohim" in its literal meaning, so that v. 27 forbids cursing or blaspheming God, nwn nln: I m nnnl tn'5. In the same way the verse is interpreted by R. Akiba, in Mekilta d. R. Ishmael (ed. Weiss, Io2b). As a contrast to these literal interpretations of the verse, the saying of the Dorshe Reshumot is quoted. They do not take the word "Elohim" in its literal meaning, to designate God, but they consider it as a 1wn, a sign, designating the human judge who executes divine justice. The meaning of v. 27 is, accordingly, to forbid the cursing or reviling of a human judge. For it would be unbecoming in God to forbid man to curse or revile Him. It might imply that it could affect Him. They further saw in the proximity of the two verses, 27 and 28, an indication that there is a relation of cause and effect between the two actions forbidden by them. They mean: Do not curse the judge, that you may not bring curses upon your harvest.

It is one of Philo's rules of allegorical interpretation, to consider the position of the verses and attach a special meaning to their juxtaposition (comp. Sieg- fried, 1. c., 178-179). The next step taken by the Dorshe Reshumot in developing their method was to extend its application to other passages the literal interpretation of which presented some difficulty" and for this reason had to be abandoned, as the literal interpretation of the anthropomorphic expres- sions about God had to be abandoned because of the insur- mountable difficulty they presented.

The Dorshe Reshumot'9 said that the verse in Deut. 28, 66, "And thy life shall hang (in doubt) before thee," applies to the man who lets his Tefillin hang; that is, who is suspended in doubt in regard to his beliefs and religious principles, symbolized by the Tefillin. The literal meaning of this passage presents some diffi- culty, for how can life hang? "Thy life shall hang before thee" does not give good sense. The literal interpretation of this passage had, therefore, to be abandoned, and the word l"n, "thy life", is taken by the Dorshe Reshumot in a figurative sense, as a e;wn, a symbolic sign, for the religious 18 It was one of the rules of Philo, that whenever the passage presents some difficulty, or does not yield good sense, the literal meaning is to be abandoned, and the allegorical adopted.

Tefillin, in the phrase lrDn ,nlnn, does not mean the phylacteries themselves, but that for which they stand as symbols.

In these beliefs a man must be firm and steadfast, upright and faithful, and not wavering and doubting." The interpretation which the Dorshe Reshumot give to this passage in Deut. 28, 66, is the same as Philo's. In his treatise "On the Posterity of Cain," ch. viii, Philo says20: "'Thy life shall hang in doubt before thee,' for it is the nature of the foolish man who is always being tossed about in a manner contrary to right reason to be hostile to tran- quility and rest, and not stand firmly or with a sure founda- tion on any doctrine whatever. Accordingly, he is full of different opinions at different times, and sometimes even in the same circumstances, without any new occurrence having arisen to affect them, he will be perfectly contrary to himself, now great, now little, now hostile, now friendly, and, in short, he will, so to say, be everything that is most inconsistent in a moment of time, and as the Lawgiver says: 'All his life shall hang in doubt before him,' having no firm footing, but being constantly tossed about by opposing cir- cumstances which drag it different ways." 20 All quotations from Philo's works are given in this article according to Young's English translation.</page><page sequence="19">ANCIENT JEWISH ALLEGORISTS--LAUTtRBACH 309 Evidently Philo and the Dorshe Reshumot agree, only the interpretation of the latter has not been preserved in its original, but rather in a condensed and shortened form. Considering that this is true, that the sayings of the Dorshe Reshumot have not been transmitted to us in their original form, we may doubt whether the word Tefillin was used by them to designate the principles or doctrines of the religion. It is more probable that the Dorshe Reshumot, in their interpretation, used another, more explicit word, to designate religious doctrines or beliefs. The later rabbis, who often used their own terms in reproducing the in- terpretation or meaning given to certain passages by the Dorshe Reshumot, must have substituted here the term Tefillin, which to them symbolized the religious doctrines, for some other word used by the Dorshe Reshumot themselves. In interpreting the word l "n, "thy life," to mean religion, which is the source of true life, the Dorshe Reshumot were supported by the fact that in many passages of the Scripture, as, for instance, Deut. 30, 15, 20, the word w4n , "life," is obviously used as a figure of speech, to designate the law, or religion, as the source of life. It was one of the rules of allegorical interpretation given by Philo, that the literal interpretation of a word is to be abandoned when it becomes evident from the context that it is used merely in a figurative sense (comp. Siegfried, 1. c., 168). The Palestinian allegorists, the Dorshe Reshumot, independently of Philo, followed the same rule, and they even made it the means of extending the applica- tion of their method. Thus, for instance, if in a given passage of the Scripture a word was obviously used, to judge from the context, in a figurative sense, to designate a thing not covered by its literal meaning, then the Dorshe</page><page sequence="20">310 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Reshumot would consider it an established fact that it can be used as a tln, a figure, or sign, to designate the thing, and they would interpret it in the same figurative sense even in passages in which the context demanded or favored a literal interpretation. Examples of such an extended application of their method are the following two sayings of the Dorshe Reshumot: Mekilta d.-R. Ishmael, Way. I, ed. Weiss, 52b, and Mekilta d. R. Simeon, ed. Hoffmann, 72, and b.

The Dorshe Reshumot said, They did not find the words of the law, or religious instruction, which are called water meta- phorically,21 for thus it is said (Isa. 55, I): "Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the water." Because in this passage in Isaiah the word "water" is evidently used as a figure of speech to designate the Divine word, the Dorshe Reshumot interpreted it, in a figurative sense, to designate symbolically the Divine law, even in the passage in Exodus, where its simple and literal meaning is patent. Philo is also in the habit of interpreting the word "water" in a figurative sense, to mean the Divine word, or wisdom. Thus, in his treatise, "On the Allegories of the Sacred Laws," II, ch. xxi, he interprets the passage in Deut. 8, 14, "Who brought thee forth water," to mean the 21 The word I3Vtt2 here is derived from the term tmZ which means "allegorical interpretation" (see above p. 301 and comp.

Also in his treatise, "On Dreams, That They Are Sent from God," II, ch. xxxi, and ibid., ch. xxxviii, he interprets the words of Ps. 65, Io, "the river of God full of water," to mean the Divine word full of wisdom.

The Dorshe Reshumot said, He showed him the words of the Torah, which are designated as a tree in a figurative sense, as it is said (Prov. 3, I8): "She [the Torah, or Wisdom] is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her." The Dorshe Reshumot took the word yr, "tree", as a symbol, or sign, representing figuratively the Torah, because, in one passage of the Scripture, this word is obviously used as a figurative expression, to designate the Torah. Philo, "On the Posterity of Cain", ch. xlv, also interprets the sweet- ening branch thrown into the water as meaning "a medi- cine upon our soul causing it to love labor". Accordingly, he interprets "Marah", not as a real place where the waters were bitter, but as a certain state of mind. Also in the treatise "On the Migration of Abraham", ch. viii, Philo ex- plains "tree" as meaning "virtue", and the waters as mean- ing "mind." It is evident that the Dorshe Reshumot, inter- preting "tree" to mean the Law, must also have interpreted "Marah" in an allegorical sense, and not literally as a place of bitter waters, for bitter waters cannot be made sweet by words of the law. But the saying of the Dorshe Reshumot has been preserved in an incomplete form; it is shortened; it mentions only that the tree was not a real tree, and omits that the bitter waters were not real bitter waters.</page><page sequence="22">312 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The following saying of the Dorshe Reshumot has also come down to us in a condensed form.

The premise on which this saying of the Dorshe Re- shumot is based is omitted here. They took the word nrrS, "congregation," not in its literal meaning, as the com- munity or the entire congregation, but in accordance with their method, they interpreted it as a sign standing for a group of ten persons. They applied here the same principle as in interpreting rv, "tree," to mean "words of the law." Because in one passage of the Scripture (Nunb. 14, 27), the word rniy, "congregation", is used to designate a group of ten,22 the Dorshe Reshumot took the word as a sign for 22 The phrase in Num. 14, 27, "this evil congregation," has been understood as referring to the spies, Joshua and Caleb excluded, hence it came to be used as a designation for a group of ten, for besides Joshua and Caleb there were only ten spies. See Mishnah Sanhedrin i. 6, and also Mishnah Abot iii. 7. It is noteworthy that this interpretation of the Dorshe Reshumot effected a practical decision that cases in which the life of the defendant is in jeopardy can only be decided by a body of thirty judges. Thits is an exception to the' rule given by Weiss (Middot Soferim on Mekilta 53a), that the interpretation of the Dorshe Reshumot were not considered to be of the kind by means of which halakic laws are derived from the written law: l15'Ip.ol Kth illO n mi'I ~ 1 tt''l l' Dt 115n W ,l I 4 21-l D 1 'I '.

And as in the passage Num. 35, 24-25, the word occurs three times, they derived from it that three such groups of ten, or thirty persons, are required to judge and decide a case in which the life of the defendant is in jeopardy. A further step, extending the application of their method, was made by the Dorshe Reshumot, when they brought it to bear on passages and words the literal meaning of which afford no difficulty whatever, and which are in the Scripture not used in an allegorical sense anywhere. Thus, for instance, they would interpret proper names, not as names, but as signs or symbols for certain states of mind that may be indicated by the proper name. Of this kind is the following saying in Mekilta d. R. Simon, ed. Hoff- mann, 82: Di-pT l9"lW 46 Dw87 }lp?n M5M D'lrn1 tI p t14-in nrnwin Wr11 5M M5M mz Mmr i 14wn Nn rW r p z s l:)! mil n,i tIn 5nw SW :23^I n i i K n The Dorshe Reshumot said, Rephidim [mentioned in Exod. 17, 8 as the place where Analek fought with Israel] means nothing else than "weakness of hands", because the Israel- ites relaxed in their keeping of the law, therefore came the enemy upon them, for the enemy comes only because of sin and transgression. The passage does not mean, accordingly, "Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim", but rather, "Amalek came and fought with Israel because of their neglect to keep the law."

"And Manasseh is Mine", Manasseh is to be taken literally, not as referring to the tribe, but to King Manasseh. "Ephraim is the strength of My head"; Ephraim here means Jeroboam, who was an Ephraimite. "Judah is My lawgiver"; Judah stands here for Ahithophel, who came from the tribe of Judah. "Moab is My washpot"; this alludes to Gehazi, whose punishment had some connection with bathing or washing [he was punished for taking some- thing from Naaman, who bathed in the Jordan, and be- came healed]. "Over Edom I will cast out My shoe"; Edom here designates Doeg the Edomite. The words are spoken by God, and they thus indicate that all the persons alluded to will become reconciled to God and come to Him in the other world. The words in the two verses, 9-Io of Ps. 60, are taken out of their connection and away from their literal mean- ing. They are interpreted as signs or symbols alluding to certain persons, since they can be taken remotely as re- minders of an event or an accident in their lives. This method was applied by the allegoristic Dorshe Reshumot as well as by Philo, who gives as a rule for allegorical in- terpretation, that a word may be explained independently of the sense clearly indicated by the connection in which it stands with the other words in the sentence (compare Siegfried, 1. c., I70-I7I). The same disregard for the literal meaning of words and the context in which they are found is also to be seen in the following interpretation of the Dorshe Reshumot: Midrash Hagadol, ed.

The meaning of this saying is, What will become of the relation between God and Israel expressed by these two sentences? The word lt stands as a sign for the whole sentence in Exod. 15, 2, beginning with this word, and N:n is a sign or symbol for the first sentence of the decalogue, the first word of which is ':=t, "I am." As has already been said above, the first letter of a word and the first word of a sentence can be used as a sign for the word, and the sentence, respectively. This method of taking a word as a sign to remind one of a sentence beginning with the word is applied in the following interpretation of the Dorshe Reshumot in the Midrash Hagadol, ed.

Here the word 'nlp is not taken as the infinitive preceding the verb ilp1' to mean: "God will surely visit you." The word nilp is rather interpreted as a sign for the phrase in Exod. 31, I6, used by Moses, which also begins with 'nlp, and it characterizes the true redeemer, who will use this phrase on his appearance. The following verb, 'nlpm, is the predicate. The one who will use the phrase tilp, "will visit you" and bring you out of this land. It was a rule of allegorical interpretation applied by Philo to derive a special meaning from a word seemingly super- fluous. The infinitive preceding a verb was considered by Philo a superfluous word of this sort (comp. Siegfried, 1. c., I68-I69). The Dorshe Reshumot followed the same rule, and therefore they sought to get a special meaning out of the infinitive 'nlpm preceding the verb nlp-' in Gen. 50, 24.

The Dorshe Reshumot said, "Because the Israelites were com- manded in Marah in regard to judgments and civil laws, and He gave them the Ten Commandments, Moses said, 'Lord of the Universe, the evil inclination may cause Thy children to go astray, so that they will transgress the com- mandments, and Thou wilt banish them from before Thee and sell them as slaves.'" For this reason he (Moses) began with the following verse (2), "If thou buy a He- brew servant," that means, if thou causest the Hebrew (people) to be acquired as slaves by the kingdoms of the earth, let not more than six kingdoms oppress them, namely, Babylonia, Media, Persia, Greece, Syria,26 and Rome. This is the meaning of the words, "six years shall he serve." Moses further said: "Lord of the uni- verse, let them not remain forever in the hands of Rome, show them Thy mercy, though they do not deserve it, and let them become free." This is the meaning of the words, "and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing." The Scripture could have used the word ni5 , "alone," in the phrase, "if he came in by himself, he shall go out by him- self". Why is the word in: (meaning, also "with his wing") used? Moses said: "May it never come about, but if it should happen that, as a result of their sins, their enemies descend upon them as with wings, as the eagles that fly near heaven-for it is said (Lam. 4, 9): 'Our 26 'W1t stands here for Syria, not for Assyria.</page><page sequence="30">320 THt JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW persecutors are swifter than the eagles of heaven'-then, O Lord of the universe, give Thou them safe and reliable wings, with which the persecuted dove may fly home," as alluded to in Isa. 6o, 8. We see here again that the Dorshe Reshumot applied the rule of 1b2'Dn (see above), and in the position of the two verses I and 2 near each other, they saw a rela- tion of cause and effect indicated. The words are spoken by Moses and addressed to God: After Thou hast given them Thy laws, the transgression of which may bring them into slavery, deal mercifully with them. The six years are sym- bolical expressions for the six kingdoms that successively oppressed Israel. The word 'nIv "Hebrew" is not ad- jective to '1n, "servant," but stands for the Hebrew peo- ple. The word 1w:3, which can also mean "with his wing," is a symbolical expression for the swift enemy as well as for the wing with which Israel, the gentle dove, will save herself. This interpretation of the word i1n the Dorshe Reshumot derived from the fact that the Scrip- ture does not use here the synonymous expression 2b5, "alone," which has no other meaning. In using the word 1:n , which means "alone," but has also the meaning "with his wing," the Scripture conveys the idea that we can in- terpret it according to its second meaning. This method is observed also by their fellow allegorist, Philo, one of whose rules for allegorical interpretation was, that special consideration is to be given to the difference between syn- onymous expressions, and if in a particular passage a par- ticular synonym is used, the Scripture meant to indicate a special meaning contained in it and not in its synonyms (comp. Siegfried, 1. c., 171 ff). The allegoristic Dorshe Reshumot followed another rule of allegorical interpretation often used by Philo,</page><page sequence="31">ANCIENT JEWISH ALLEGORISTS--LAUTRBACH 321 namely, to seek to exhaust all possible meanings of a word, and thus gain a new sense from the scriptural passage (comp. Siegfried, 1. c., I74-I75). Accordingly, they would interpret a word as a Dlwn, sign or symbol, suggesting some idea, if one of several possible meanings of the word could, if but remotely, indicate or recall the idea. This is seen in the following saying of the Dorshe Reshumot quoted by R. Akiba, in Midrash Kohelet Rabba, x.

Akiba said in a discourse, The passage in Isa. 5, 14, "Therefore hell has enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure," means hell opened her mouth for the one who possesses no virtuous action that will cause his merits to overbalance his shortcomings, for the Dorshe Reshumot said, A man is judged according to the majority of his actions, and a man must always consider himself as having as many merits as faults, or as many good actions as bad ones to his credit, so that when he does one good deed, happy he, for he has thereby caused the scale holding his merits to sink, and when he has committed one sin, woe to him, because he has caused the scale of his guilt to decline. The Dorshe Reshumot, whom R. Akiba mentions here, are his authority for this interpretation of the passage in Isaiah. For the Dorshe Reshumot were not merely intent upon giving a general rule for a man's estimate of himself and his actions; they were interpreters of the Scripture. Their saying here is evidently based upon their peculiar</page><page sequence="32">322 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW interpretation" of the words pn 5:5, which can also mean "without law," or "without the fulfilment of a law." They, therefore, took the words not as the adverbial clause "with- out measure," but as a IMn, a sign, representing the man for whom hell opens her mouth as the one who falls short by one in the observance of the commandments. Hence they derived their saying that one good or bad action can decide a man's standing and his fate. The same rule, of seeking another meaning to a word, in order to derive the allegorical sense of the passage, is observed in the following saying of the Dorshe Reshumot (Mekilta d. R. Ishm., Way. IV, ed. Weiss, 58a, on Exod. I6, 21): tK:t niDK n1D1wn FWlU nrnwn n'nwn "ip33 "ip33 rini^ i^p5 :&gt;,nn 5lKn f&amp;s&lt; nytW }D1 nnnnw "And they gathered it every morning."

The Dorshe Reshumot, however, said that we learn from this passage, that the curse, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread" (Gen. 3, I9) applied even to the manna; also that was eaten in the sweat of the brow. It is not reported how the Dorshe Reshumot derived their statement from this passage, but we can guess at their method. From the preceding interpretation of the words pnn:31 rpnn as meaning "every morning," in contrast to which the saying of the Dorshe Reshumot is adduced, we can learn, that the Dorshe Reshumot did not interpret the words np: p n1pnn1 according to their literal 27 Although the saying of the Dorshe Reshumot is quoted as an independ- ent saying, it is based upon the passage from Isaiah mentioned by R. Akiba. Only the Midrash did not ca.re to quote the passage again, after having quoted it at the beginning of the paragraph. Similarly, in Sifre, Deut. 49, the saying of the Dorshe Reshumot is apparently quoted as an independent saying, though it is based upon and interprets the scriptural phrase 1 np'1?bl quoted in the beginning of the paragraph; see above p. 304.</page><page sequence="33">ANCIENT JEWISH ALLEGORISTS-LAUTERBACH 323 meaning. They did not take them to mean "morning," they attributed some other meaning to them. Now the word lp: can also mean "search," "seek," (Lev. 13, 36; 27, 33). According to their method of letting the sense of a passage depend upon their preferred meaning of a word selected from several possible meanings (see above) they here interpreted the word ipli: to mean not "in the morning," but "with seeking, with diligent search," and they deduced from it, that even the manna was eaten in the sweat of the brow, since the people had to exert themselves in seeking it; and they succeeded in gathering it only after diligent, toilsome search.28 In Me- kilta d. R. S. b. J., ed. Hoffmann, 78, this saying of the Dorshe Reshumot is mentioned as being based on the sec- ond half of the verse, ibSa 'n r ", "every man accord- ing to his eating." According to this version, the Dorshe Reshumot fol- lowed another rule of allegoristic interpretation often ap- plied by Philo, though originally Palestinian (comp. Sieg- fried, 1. c., I70), namely, the rule whereby an indication of a deeper meaning, a hint of some idea, is discovered in the repetition of things known, or said before. Accord- ingly, the Dorshe Reshumnot interpreted the words ,nn 's l52s, verse 21, not to mean "as much as one could eat," for this was said in verse I8, "they gathered every man according to his eating." The repetition of the words in verse 21 must indicate something else, they are a mln signifying the manner in which the manna was eaten, 28 It may be that the saying of the Dorshe Reshumot is based upon the words ISM 'InS tiWt, as appears from the Mekilta d. R. S. But in the Mekilta d. R. Ishmael the second half of the verse is not quoted, though the interpretation is based on it; as often happens in the Midrash, only the first part of a verse is quoted, even if the interpretation refers to the last half of it (see above p. 314).</page><page sequence="34">324 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW namely, "man according to his eating," as man can eat, and men, the children of Adam, according to the curse decreed upon them, can eat only in the sweat of their brow, and the manna was no exception to the rule, Manna also was eaten in the way bread is eaten by man, namely, in the sweat of his brow. It is probable that the same rule, of interpreting a word according to one of its possible meanings, and thus making it suggest some idea, was applied in the fol- lowing saying of the Dorshe Reshumot, although its appli- cation is not so clearly visible as in the other two sayings.

The Dorshe Reshu- mot said, "The Israelites called it manna." Here, as in many other places, the saying of the Dorshe Reshumot is quoted as a contrast to the preceding literal interpretation of the Scriptural passage. According to the latter, the word tn means nothing else than no "what," and the phrase, "they said one to another, 'It is manna,'" simply means, they asked each other what it was. According to the Dorshe Reshumot, however, the words do not express a question at all, they express a positive statement. The phrase, "They said one to another, b,in i;," means they declared it was to be called "manna," that is, they called it by that name.

Succah 39 b), as Weiss in Middot Soferim interprets it, nor can it mean "something pre- pared," tI =- n1 Jonah 4, 6, as Wiinsche in his Ger- man translation of the Mekilta understands it. The Dorshe Reshumot, being allegorists, must have given the name "manna" some allegorical or symbolical meaning, not the simple literal meaning, as "food," or "something prepared." This is especially evident from the passage in Mekilta Way. V, ed Weiss, 59a, where the saying of the Dorshe Reshumot is repeated as interpreting Exod. I6, 31: nK Itnp 5Nwn n4p Tnsw nnin 4WV18 In Inv nK iwl nm INf-ln "And the house of Israel called the name thereof manna." The Dorshe Reshumot said, "The house of Israel called its name manna." Here the Dorshe Reshumot apparently do not add anything to what is said in the text, and one cannot see what interpretation they meant to give to the passage in verse 31 by repeating it almost in the same words.29 It is, therefore, evident that the Dorshe Reshumot interpreted 29 This difficulty was felt by R. Tobiah b. Eliezer, and in his Midrash Lelkab Tob, ed. Buber, 57, he tries to explain it by remarking, after quoting the saying of the Dorshe Reshumot: 3r '11p'l 'lt I INt'= , q~ 5 &gt; Dn1'1 on1 N 1i In }t n'n H 1I. "But before the children of Israel came and called its name 'manna' it was not called manna, but 'food of the mighty,' or 'angels' food,'" according to Ps. 78, 25. A similar explanation is given by Wiinsche in his German translation of the Mekilta. He remarks: Der eigentliche Name ist nach Ps. 78, 24, tltt: pi', Korn des Himrmels." Comp. also Friedmann in Meir Ayin on Mekilta 5Ia. But these explanations do not explain the difficulty. For if the Dorshe Reshumot meant to say that "manna" was merely the name used by the children of Israel, and not the original or real name of the heavenly food, they ought to have said that there was another name for it, and not merely repeat the words of the text, "The house of Israel called its name 'manna.' " Besides, one would think that the name given to it by the Israelites, who first saw it and first named it, should be its original and correct name.</page><page sequence="36">326 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the word tp in an allegorical sense, not according to its literal meaning. In their saying, "The children of Israel, or the house of Israel, called it manna," the word manna is used in a symbolical sense, and thus their interpretation of the scriptural passage is conveyed to us. What this allegorical meaning of the word "manna" was according to the Dorshe Reshumot cannot be learned with certainty from their saying itself, which, like most of their sayings, has not been preserved in its original form. It is probably quoted incompletely in the Mekilta. We can, however, guess at what this meaning was, when we consider how their fellow-allegorist Philo interpreted the word. Ac- cording to Philo, manna is "the word of God, all nourish- ing wisdom" (On Seeking Instruction, ch. xl). In an- other passage Philo says: "Moses calls manna the most ancient word of God, by which appellation is understood something of the most general nature" (That the Worse Is Accustomed to be Plotting against the Better, ch. xxxi). Again, in the third book of the treatise on the Allegories of the Sacred Laws (ch. li), when he interprets the pas- sage in Deut. 8, 3, "and He gave you manna to eat," Philo says: "And the proof of this is that He nourishes us with His own word, which is most universal of all things, for manna, being interpreted, means "what," and "what" is the most universal of all the things: for the word of God is over all the world, and is the most ancient and the most universal of all the things that are created." It is probable that the allegoristic Dorshe Reshumot interpreted the word In as a mr2n, symbol, signifying "the word of God," or "spiritual food." In contrast to the literal interpretation of the words Nin Ir, expressing a question, "what is it?" the saying of the Dorshe Reshumot is quoted as interpreting it in an allegorical way, mean-</page><page sequence="37">ANCIENT JEWISH ALLCGORISTS-LAUTERBACH 327 ing "that universal thing," "the word of God," all-nourish- ing wisdom. The idea of seeing in the manna merely spiritual food finds its echo in many utterances of the Pal- estinian teachers. Thus the saying of R. Akiba, Yoma 75a, based upon an interpretation of Ps. 78, 25, that the manna was the bread which the angels ate probably had the mean- ing, that manna was but spiritual food.30 The same idea is reflected in other interpretations, as, for instance, of the passage Exod. I6, 31, where it is said that the manna was white, which is taken by the Talmud to mean that the manna caused the sins of Israel to become white, that is, freed Israel from their sins, nlr [W Dirmnlnls rnD (Yoma 75), and again, in the interpretation of the words y1 Pltn nimi, Exod. 17, 31, as meaning ,n,W n;l6S nln Dts &gt;, 1i:v 'lmwn, "The manna was like the words of the haggadah, which attract the heart of man" (Mekilta Way., ed. Weiss, 59b). In Yoma 75, this interpretation is given in the name of Aherim, "others," which may have 80R. Ishmael's remark, that "R. Akiba made a mistake, for angels eat no bread" (Yoma 75), was not justified, since R. Akiba knew well that angels eat no bread. But his saying referred to spiritual food, or wisdom. As this idea, of identifying the manna with wisdom or the word of God, implied the denial of the actual story of the Scripture about the miracle of the manna, it was not popular among the rabbis, and sayings expressing this idea were either altogether suppressed or at least modified and not fully quoted. Thus, for instance, the saying that like the prophet the manna told the Israelites all their secrets (Mekilta, Waj. V, and Yoma 75), may have meant originally that the word of God reveals the truth, and was modified later on to mean, that by the number of the portions of manna, which miraculously came to each household in a measure corre- sponding to the number of persons belonging to it, certain secrets about the illegitimacy of children were revealed, and certain' disputes about the ownership of slaves were settled. It is probably due to the same con- siderations, in order not to deny the actuality of the miraculous food, that the saying of the Dorshe Reshumot, interpreting it allegorically, has been preserved only in a shorter form.</page><page sequence="38">328 THI JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW been applied to the anonymous allegoristic interpreters, the Dorshe Reshumot.3 '\"e have seen from all the interpretations that have been preserved to us, that the Dorshe Reshumot inter- preted the Scriptures in an allegorical way, taking the words not in their literal meaning, but as signs and sym- bols. Their interpretations are, accordingly, quoted by way of contrast with the simple and literal interpretations, i1it3n. We have also seen that these interpreters of the Scriptures were Palestinian teachers, and independent of outside influences, their methods being the product of the inner development of the Palestinian exegesis. For although we have seen that many of their interpretations are given also by Philo, and that the rules for interpreta- tion followed by them are the same that were applied by Philo, we must not assume that the Dorshe Reshumot were influenced by the Alexandrian allegorists. Rather the contrary is true, that Philo was influenced by the Pal- estinian allegoristic interpreters of the Scriptures (comp. Schiirer, Geshichte des Volkes Israel, III,4 70I ff), as his rules of allegorical interpretation were composed of the rules applied by the Palestinian teachers as well as the rules applied by the Stoic philosophers (comp. Sieg- fried, 1. c., I65). In the Dorshe Reshumot we recognize therefore, the oldest Palestinian allegoristic interpreters of the Scriptures. As their methods were purely Pales- tinian, their interpretations according to these methods, being Palestinian products, were generally known and ac- ceptable to the teachers of the law. 8l The interpretation to the word tPIt6'l given by the Dorshe Reshumot in Mekilta d. R. Simeon (see above p. 313) is ascribed in Mekilta d. R. Ishmael, Amalek I, ed. Weiss, 6ia, to the A4Yerim, from which we can see that the name A^erim, "Others," has sometimes been applied to the Dorshe Reshumot.</page><page sequence="39">ANCIENT JEWISJI ALLEGORISTS-- LAUTTRBACI 329 This explains why more sayings of the Dorshe Reshu- mot have been preserved than of the other class of allegor- ists, the Dorshe Hamurot, whose method and tendency, as we shall see, were not of Palestinian origin. In the course of time, however, the rabbis became apprehensive of the grave dangers that threatened Judaism from the allegor- istic interpretation, according to the method of lwn, or, as it is also called, n ", "allegory." For, if the words of the Scripture are taken merely as an allegorical expres- sion, 5tv, or symbolical signs, biun, and not in their lit- eral meaning, no religious law need be observed, since the words expressing it may be interpreted to us in an alle- gorical way, to mean something else than the command to do according to its literal meaning. It was, therefore, strictly forbidden to apply this method of the allegorists in interpreting scriptural passages which contain laws and commandments." R. Ishmael being the only one among the teachers who permitted himself to interpret three pas- sages of the law in an allegoristic manner, wv n tI= (Sifre Deut. 237, ed. Friedmann, II7 b; Mekilta Mishpatim, VI, ed. Weiss, 88b), taking certain words occurring in these passages not literally, but merely in a figurative sense. But the rabbis objected even to an allegoristic interpretation of 32 In the Baraita of the Thirty-two Rules of Haggadic Interpretation, by R. Eliezer b. R. Jose Hagelili, the method of 5t, of taking the words in an allegorical or parabolical sense is mentioned (rule 26), and it is added: Ir H1121I -llnrl M11M V R? nK b p ts 1 n0'r =t 0vW- no= \twlr-t 7rntr 'I tvtw ^is n ttrr: rimn htrn I t-a 1 \w 6 1:1 Sh nnt %'n ptv5t. "This method can only be used in interpreting passages of the Scriptures which do not express laws, but in those passages of the Scripture that contain laws and commandments you cannot interpret the words in a figurative and allegorical sense, excepting the three passages which R. Ishmael has interpreted in the allegoristic method." The rule as well as the limitation of its use to the portions of the Scriptures not containing laws, is older than R. Eliezer, the son of R. Jose the Galilean, who merely collected these old rules and compiled them in his Baraita.</page><page sequence="40">330 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW these portions of the Scripture, which did not contain laws. They feared that such an interpretation might lead to a denial of the historic facts narrated in the Bible, and especially to a disbelief in the miracles. As we have seen, according to the interpretation of the Dorshe Reshumot, there was no miraculous food, "manna," there was no real place Marah, in which the water was bitter, and was made sweet in a miraculous way through a certain tree. And there was no place called Rephidim, in which the Israelites engaged in battle with Amalek, and the Israelites were never wanting in real water in the wilderness. Added to the apprehensions of the rabbis was the danger of the al- legoristic method's becoming a weapon against Judaism in the hands of the followers of the new religion, who would use it to prove from the Scripture the superiority of their new faith." The rabbis, therefore, objected to the appli- cation of this method in interpreting the Scriptures, and they rejected as absolutely false most of the interpreta- 33 Paul often used the allegoristic method applied by the Dorshe Reshumot. Thus in Hebrews 7, 2, he takes the names Melchizedek and Salem, Gen. 14, i8, not as proper names, but according to the meaning which these names could have, interpreting them to mean King of Righteous- ness and King of Peace, Dt3i being interpreted like M'It, in the same manner as the Dorshe Reshumot and Philo interpreted proper names accord- ing to the meaning of the words (see above n. 24). In I Corinthians 10, 1-3, he designates the meat which the Israelites ate in the wilderness, and the drink which they drank, as "spiritual," which reminds one of the interpretation of Philo and the Dorshe Reshumnot, that "water" repre- sents the "law," and "manna," the word of God (see above pp. 3Io and 326 ff.), and not, as Meyer in his commentary explains, that they were designated as spiritual, as having been supplied supernaturally. In Galatians 5, 22-31, he seeks to prove the abolition of the law and rejection of the covenant on Sinai by allegorizing the story of Abraham's two sons Ishmael and Isaac from Hagar and Sarah, respectively, taking Hagar as a sign representing the covenant on Sinai, and Sarah, who in Gen. XI, 30, is called #1p2, "a barren woman," to represent Jerusalem, which, in Isaiah 54, is parabolically called a barren woman, and thus symbolizes the covenant of Jerusalem.</page><page sequence="41">ANCIENT JEWISH ALIEGORISTS-LAUTERBACH 331 tions of the allegorists, as well as the scriptural proofs which the followers of the new religion brought by means of such allegoristic interpretations. They could not, how- ever, reject the whole method as such, since in certain pas- sages of the Scripture its application is justified and neces- sary, and, as one rabbi said: 53w '11z: mP ,ntn 5w n ,nl 5[m nmnln:n [31 5 n Iv, l2,D ,n , "Let not the allegoristic method appear to you as slight, for by means of the alle- goristic method one may sometimes get at the true meaning of the scriptural words" (Cant. R. I, 8). They could not scorn the whole method as being false, but they could and did scorn the wild and exaggerated use made of it by a certain class of thinkers. The rabbis, therefore, declared that most of these allegoristic inter- pretations do not give the true and real sense of the scrip- tural passage. This is to be found in the interpretation according to the simple and literal meaning of the words. Thus the terms nlin, "symbolical meaning," and [vn, "allegorical meaning," came to be considered as antonyms to nnK, "true and literal meaning" (see above). Even when, for the purpose of deriving an ethical lesson, the scriptural passage may be interpreted in an allegorical way, the rabbis made it a rule that itgw 'v sNv &amp;np* lst, that its plain and literal meaning may never be ignored or denied.34 This principle, intended, as it was, as a pro- test against the allegoristic method, had also, strange as it may appear, the effect of saving the method itself and in a measure approving it. Since it was declared that the literal meaning remains always the true and correct mean- ing of the Scriptures, that it cannot be explained away by S4 Yebamot IIb, 24a, and Shabbat 63a. Although first mentioned by Judah b. IEzekiel, the rule is much older than his time and is of Palestin- ian origin.</page><page sequence="42">332 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW any allegoristic interpretation, the rabbis felt assured that no harm could come to Judaism if this method was used carefully and moderately in homiletic discourses, for the purpose of deriving moral lessons from the Scriptures, always keeping in mind and making it understood that such interpretations are not to be taken seriously, as the real meaning of the scriptural word.35 This changed atti- tude of the rabbis toward the allegoristic method weak- ened, in a measure, the resentment felt by them toward the ancient allegorists. It caused a reaction against the preval- ent tendency, which was to ignore them, let them fall into oblivion, and suppress their sayings altogether. The rabbis were now less afraid of mentioning their names occasion- ally and quoting some of their less harmful sayings. Thus it came about that a few of the interpretations of the an- cient allegorists have been preserved in the Palestinian as well as in the Babylonian Talmud, and in the Mid- rashim, originating in both countries. But even these few interpretations the rabbis did not preserve complete; they often shortened or modified them, to make them less objec- tionable and less harmful, and, as we have seen, in most cases the rabbis were careful to give, side by side with these interpretations, also the literal interpretation, 1'rw3, as the true and real meaning of the passage. The ma- jority of the interpretations of the Dorshe Reshumot, how- ever, have been lost to us, the rabbis objecting to them and not caring to preserve them.36 35 Accordingly, we find in the Talmud many interpretations in the method of the Dorshe Reshumot; a word is taken as symbolizing or repre- senting something not contained in its literal meaning. 36 Eisenstein's theory (Ozar Israel, IV, s. v. MltW1 tWTlit), that the interpretations of the Dorshe Reshumot were collected and arranged in a special Midrash, called "The Midrash of the Dorshe Reshumot," subse- quently lost, is absolutely without foundation. As we have seen, there</page><page sequence="43">ANCIENT JEWISH ALLEGORISTS-LAUTERBACH 333 was a tendency among the rabbis to suppress these interpretations, and they did not ca,re to preserve them. There never was such a Midrash of the Dorshe Reshumot. The words l'll?lZt Wl'l 'ri tt, occurring in Ba4lya's Commentary on the Pentateuch (see l'ln , in Warsaw edition, p. 7Ib) and in Ttr, Orah FIayyim, 118, do not refer to a Midrash of the Dorshe Reshumot, but to the interpretations ( WVTlt ) of some kabbalistic teachers, wh6 interpreted the letters of the alphabet as signs and according to their value as numbers (comp. Buber, Yeriot Shelomoh, I7). In Tur, Orah Hayyim, I 3, it is expressly said, in the name of R. Jebiel, tl'l1ttl1 ''lll MTMt '1Dn PI,, "the Dorshe Reshumot are the pious men of Germany." We see here plainly that the mediaeval rabbis used the name Dorshe Reshumot to designate certain mediaeval teachers. The name thus used by them has nothing to do with the ancient allegorists of that name who are mentioned in the Talmud. Iisenstein probably followed the Rab Pe'alim by R. Abraham b. Elijah of Wilna, where it is said on pp. 46-47, that there was a "Midrash Dorshe Reshumot" quoted by Jacob Asheri and Ba1ya. But this passage in Rab Pe'alim is not from R. Abraham b. Elijah. It has been put in by some copyist from a marginal note by an unknown and doubtful author (see Chones, note to Buber's Yeriot Shelomoh, 16-17). (To be concluded)</page></plain_text>
