<plain_text><page sequence="1">Patrick M. de Winter A LITTLE-KNOWN CREATION OF RENAISSANCE DECORATIVE ARTS: THE WHITE LEAD PASTIGLIA BOX</page><page sequence="2">Renaissance pastiglia caskets have so far elicited but a very limited interest on the part of historians, although there has been a brisk market for them among collectors. These unusual items of the decorative arts, readily illustrate the enthusiasm that the Italian culture of the early Cinquecento had for Antiquity and the diverse use that it made of classical models. These curious boxes, none of which are exactly alike, consist of a core of wood with gilt grounds on which have been appended a wealth of molded and yet incisively-shaped elements of classical inspiration in a hard white gesso- like substance. Rectangular, except for a few excep- tions, the main fields are occupied by historiated sub- jects. The lids - which are either in the shape of a truncated pyramid or else flat and in the latter case usually with a knob - are adorned with garlands, sphinxes, masks, tritons, and other classically inspired motifs. The lids are on hinges and generally secured with a small locq; when raised, they reveal an open storage space. Many of the boxes rest on a set of four depressed ball feet covered with acanthus designs. A census of such boxes that have so far come to our attention will be found in the Catalogue. The principal ornamentation of these caskets falls into four groups: scenes from ancient Roman history, subjects drawn from mythology, purely ornamental de- signs which are invariably antique motifs, and a few scenes derived from the Old and New Testaments. A table listing the many subjects represented will be found following the Catalogue. The 115 such boxes that we have located show a marked difference in individual artistic merit. They are also in various conditions of preservation, generally having lost much of their pris- tine appeal by the mere fact that they bear centuries of grime. For what purpose were such boxes made? They were most probably not designed to serve as storage for precious jewels, as has been suggested. Gems and costly goldsmith works were kept instead in metal strongboxes of which many examples are extant. Pastiglia caskets were, rather, essentially curios in which were kept trinkets and articles of a related nature such as seals and it was primarily their decorative quality which was valued. That a number were intended as engagement gifts is suggested by the motif of the scroll inscribed AMOR (Fig. 1) appearing on some, as well as by the many scenes of famed classical romantic couples such as Py ramus and Thisbe(¥igs. 2, 29, 68). The pastiglia boxes were an outcome of Renaissance collectors' taste for small objects - medals, coins, statuettes, gems - «all'antica». This «insatiable desire for objects of anti- quity» is grandly illustrated by the famous Grotta or treasure room of Marquess Isabella d'Este in Mantua (*). The more modest, but carefully selected, collection of objects which graces the conspicuous shelf of St. Au- gustine's studium in a painting (Fig. 3) of about 1502 by the Venetian Vittore Carpaccio, the crammed shelves which fill the lodging of the youthful prelate in a draw- ing of about 1526-27 (Fig. 4) by Lorenzo Lotto, and the bourgeois setting of the Annunciation by Francesco de' Bianchi Ferrari and Giovanni Antonio Scaccieri of 15 12 (2), correspond more readily to the actual setting in which might be found the pastiglia boxes.

In Italy, the principal item, after bedding, had been the cassone, or large chest, which doubled as seat or table while its main purpose was that of a storage area. In Quattrocento inventories and wills, cassoni are almost the only furniture mentioned. Beginning in the late fifteenth century, however, a new interest evolved in furnishing the home with wardrobes, sideboards, small upright chests with drawers, chairs, and stools as well as tables, shelves, etc. - often graced with rich carvings. When creating the picture of St. Augustine's Vision, Carpaccio, faithfully rendering elements of daily sur- roundings, included examples of the new furnishings. The production of the small ornamental boxes here under discussion is associated with this expansion of furniture-making which resulted in new surfaces on which to place them. The basic form and decorative aspect of these small boxes to some extent also relies on and recalls the large painted and carved cassoni. Five examples of our boxes (Fig. 5 and Catalogue nos. 1, 2, 8, 34, 67) with a convex lid, or convex front panel extending to form feet, are in fact obviously shaped in imitation of their larger rela- tives. However, the respective manufacturing techni- que of the cassoni and the pastiglia boxes, as we shall see, was quite different. The former were frequently prepared with gesso - a thick white water-based paint mixed with chalk, gypsum or plaster, and which has no grain - to be polychromed or to be adorned with actual reliefs (3). As the untreated surface of wood, even after a great deal of finishing, is still porous and not smooth enough for gilding or polychroming, two artistic pro- cesses important in Italian painting and carving since the Trecento, the use of such a calcium compound as a preparatory ground had already been long-standing. It was a simple and efficacious way of making the ground even, and with a subsequent application of size, the surface became resilient for gilding or polychroming. Applied in several coats, gesso can also be built up to attain quite a thickness, and when dry, can be readily carved and modelled. This technique was also used on small caskets, as well as on chests of considerable size (4). The decoration of the series of boxes presently under study has too readily been assumed to be in effect either gesso or rice flour paste (5). The Italian word pastiglia, which derives from the Latin pastillus , a small roll of bread or a sugared troche, has been used loosely in this context by specialists of the decorative arts to denote reliefs not carved out of wood on cassoni, boxes or frames, with little attempt to differentiate between various constituents and manufacturing techniques (6). The decoration of the boxes under study appears, how- ever, fairly consistently to be made of a same compound. Unlike the reliefs of the cassoni and those of the small Quattrocento Tuscan caskets which have been carved from superimposed coats of gesso sottile, the decoration of our boxes is molded into forms which have then been glued to the surface of the box. Closer in meaning than the term pastiglia to describe the present process is the word pastillage which the French have fortuitously coined to describe the decorative process in the field of ceramics which consists of gluing on an object separate ornamental motifs, or else in culinary terms, the as- sembling of various sweets in order to arrive at the imitation of real forms. That the decoration of these particular caskets is made from a molded substance, rather than carved gesso, is evident on close examina- tion: the forms are sharp and the material has the firm- ness of soft stone. To our knowledge, the laboratory of the British (3) Among large cassoni with an important gesso ornamenta- tion, the following examples may be pointed out: a chest with gilded figures in relief said to date of about 1475 in The Metropolitan Museum, New York (W.M. ODOM, A History of Italian Furniture From the Fourteenth to the Early Nineteenth Centuries , Garden City, N.Y., 1918, I, p. 57, fig. 49), a chest with stylized ornaments of gilded relief stucco given as Venetian beginning of the sixteenth century in the Cini Collection, Venice for which see C. ALBERICI, Il Mobile veneto , Milan, 1980, p. 54, fig. 63, and still another in the Kunsthandwerk Museum in Frankfurt:am-Main given as Venetian of 1550, for which see F. SCHOTTMÜLLER, Furniture and Interior Decoration of the Italian Renaissance, New York, 1928, p. 39, fig. 85. ( ) Among relatively small boxes of this type made in Tuscany in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, there is a noteworthy gilt and polychromed example dating of about 1400 in the Cleveland Museum of Art (Acc. 54.600, ill. in Handbook of the Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, 1969 ed., p. 55, 1978 ed., p. 69). It is said to have come from a Sienese convent. Not only has the ground of this box been prepared with gesso sottile , a very fine sulphate, but the carved reliefs have been rendered smooth and given a soft appearance with a coating of the same substance.

This research was undertaken in the 1940s at the insti- gation of W. L. Hildburgh, a collector who published a pioneering article in the field (7). Our own research and conversations with Mr. Baynes Copes, head of the laboratory of the British Museum, provides results of a broader scope. From the technical standpoint, the pas- tiglia of these small boxes can be more clearly defined: it is + 87% white lead; the rest is sulphate and binder which, on account of its high phosphate content prob- ably includes egg yoke as well as the white, either beaten or sieved. White lead, the hydrated basic lead carbonate, was well known in Medieval and Renaissance times, as it continued to be during later centuries as well, in the form of a finely ground powder used as white pigment. The traditional method of producing white lead, as Pliny already described it in his Natural History (8) was to suspend lead shavings in a closed container, such as an earthenware pot, above a bed of vinegar, which was kept at a warm temperature, the lead being exposed to the vapors of the vinegar but generally not being touched by the liquid. The heat and acetic acid of the vapor were left to react on the metal for a period of approximately six weeks. By then, the metallic lead had in part been chemically transformed, as a crust of white lead had formed on the exterior of the shavings, or coils. It was then necessary to scrape this from the unconverted metal, to wash it free of acid and soluble salt and grind it into a fine powder. Light roasting in the sun may have subsequently been necessary in order to arrive at a pure white (9). The matrices used to shape the elements of the decoration were probably metal rather than wood, which would leave traces of grain, or clay, which would not yield such sharp imprints. Many matrices were needed for the decoration of a single box and even for a single ornamental or narrative relief panel. Indeed, a methodical examination of the decoration of these boxes reveals that it was composed of many separate impres- sions often made individually from small molds repre- senting figures, animals, shrubs, arms, armor and other implements, and elements of landscapes or townscapes. This unique process in Renaissance decorative arts was developed to the extent that the maker of such caskets was in some ways like a typographer faced with an alphabet of forms to fill a field or surface. For a given box a single mold was readily used more than one time, but the impression was often fitted in different arrange- ments and combinations. The vocabulary of elements, it is obvious, was certainly developed with the purpose of being used on more than one single box. The molded forms, and this is especially true of figures, were often plied into different positions, indicating that they were attached while still in a moist and plastic state. The fact that white lead was available in quantity presupposes the presence of metallic lead; this metal is likely to have been the material used for the molds. Its soft and malle- able property indeed would lend itself to taking a very fine imprint and could also be bent to partly alter the original form. Of all metals, lead is even more advantageous since it reaches its melting point with a minimum of heat (150° centigrade) and could easily be melted down and recast when the molds lost their shape (10). Prior to the application of the pastiglia ornamenta- tion, a thin layer of gesso was applied and the fields of the boxes were generally punched, usually with close courses of stippling forming oblique parallel lines. In the more carefully produced examples, the punchmark- ing forms two or three different patterns, for example, a diamond design with a much larger dot at center (Figs. 8, 14), a carpet of rounded palmettes (Figs. 7, 14), or fine floral designs. After receiving punchmarks, the surface of the box was covered with red bole and overlaid with gold leaf. The pastiglia ornaments, while still malleable state, were then affixed with glue, probably made of rabbit skin, known to have a high property of adhesion. In addition to their ornamental quality, the punchmarks also provided asperities for the glue. Pas- tiglia elements were frequently superimposed on each other: warriors' shields are tacked to figures, figures are set on architectural elements and landscapes, and some O W.L.

When the box now in Cleveland arrived at the Museum in a crate, the shield of the centurion in the foreground plane behind Titus Manlius Torquatus (Fig. 6) had come detached during the transport, exposing an intact figure beneath, com- plete with arm and hand. As the surface of the com- pound under the shield had not darkened with time and dirt, it was mere play to glue it back (Fig. 7) exactly to its place. Pastiglia boxes with relief scenes from Roman his- tory can be considered representative of the Renaissance interest in the moral and pagan values of Antiquity and in its forms. Presented frieze-like, with the obvious intent of connoting monumental classical reliefs, the subjects of the panels fall well within Cinquecento no- tions, bolstering the ideals of lofty purpose and of moral fortitude shared by both ancient Roman and Italian Renaissance cultures. Re-created are vivid equestrian battles (Fig. 8), images of triumphs bestowed by the Roman Senate on victorious generals, demonstrations of stern courage such as the deed of the legendary hero Gaius Mucius Scaevola (Figs. 9, 10), who in an extra- ordinarily stoic disregard for physical pain thrust his right hand into a flaming urn until it was consumed, or else the justice of Manlius Torquatus, the unflinching commander (Fig. 7) who calls for the execution of his own son for violating orders. Among the 115 boxes we have come to know, the most frequently represented subject is that of Mucius Scaevola (Figs. 9, 10, 23), recurring thirty-one times. Another often illustrated scene of stoic action appearing nineteen times is that of the torment of the consul Atilius Regulus at the hands of the Carthaginians (Fig. 12) who inflict on him excruciating tortures, placing him in a barrel in which are hammered large iron nails. The scene, represented with little variation on the cas- kets, is composed of the bearded hero in the cylindrical vessel at center of the pictorial field, with soldiers and men dressed in togas set frieze-like at either side and gesturing emphatically. Forming a pair are the stern episodes of Lucius Junius Brutus, founder of the Roman Republic, and of the general Titus Manlius Torquatus, who see that justice is implemented by ordering the beheading of their sons. Self-sacrifice for the worthier survival of the nation is exemplified by seventeen rep- resentations of the famed story of Marcus Curtius (Fig. 16) as recounted by Livy, Valerius Maximus, and then in the Renaissance by Petrarch. Well represented, with nine different scenes, are episodes of the famed legend of the three Horatii (Fig. 14), while Horatius Codes (Fig. 18), a still better-known example of Roman steadfast- ness in Renaissance times, surprisingly appears only once among our 115 boxes. Women too enjoy a prominent place in the iconography of the caskets. Feminine influence to save the Patria is the subject of a scene repeated on a few boxes. The patrician Gaius Marcius Coriolanus, after having been wronged, joined the Volci, leading them to storm Rome. As Coriolanus arrived at the city walls (Fig. 19), a number of Roman matrons headed by his wife and his mother Veturia, met him and their lofty words reminding him of his duty to his ancestral city proved to be more powerful than wounded pride. Luc- retia, wife of Collatinus, is the legendary model of early Roman womanly virtue and supreme example of the chaste wife. She appears (Fig. 20) on eighteen different boxes at the moment when, in the agony of despair, she stabs herself to expiate her guiltless «crime» . Though not Romans, young David and Judith were readily integrated, in Renaissance times, with classical protagonists as prime examples of courage. While David holding the severed head of Goliath (Fig. 21) is represented only once among the known boxes, Judith (Fig. 14), appears no less than nineteen times, standing on a podium with sword in hand, and brandishing the bearded head of Holofernes. Several panels of the caskets are also visual translations of the lofty images created by the late fourteenth-century poet Francesco Petrarch. His De viris illustribus provided the impetus for some illust- rations of the lives of Scipio Africanus (Figs. 23, 30), Julius Caesar (Fig. 24), and Trajan. Some of Petrarch's Trionfi , poems in which he envisions the glorification of six lofty allegories, had become part of an even more widely used imagery in the Renaissance. Countless rep- resentations of three of these triumphs, that of Love, of Chastity and of Fame appear on cassoni and panel páint- ings. The same recur on our boxes: Love, with the infant Cupid prancing on a horsedrawn cart ready to fire his darts (Fig. 25), Chastity (Fig. 26), a maiden seated atop a cart led by unicorns, and Fame (Figs. 27, 28), a youth or a commander on a cart drawn by elephants or horses and surrounded by a cortege of lictors, insignia bearers and trumpet blowing attendants. Several other scenes of the pastiglia boxes relate to amorous themes, doubtlessly appealing to feminine sen- sibilities or fulfilling the purpose of a sentimental gift. Among these are the well-known contest in which the shepherd Paris judges the beauty of three goddesses and selects Venus, which appears on fourteen boxes (Fig. 29), the hunt of the Calydonian boar with Meleager and</page><page sequence="6">DE Winter - THE WHITE LEAD PASTIGLIA BOX 13 Atalanta, and the abduction of Europa (Fig. 31) by Jupiter. The story of Queen Dido, whose uncontrolled passion for Aeneas led her to a tragic end (Fig. 32), is another example of an amorous subject represented on some of the boxes, as is the moving myth of Orpheus and Eurydice and the lesser known tragic episode of Hero about to hurl herself into the Hellespont after sighting the drowned body of her lover Leander. Another story of love which occurs frequently (nineteen times), is the touching legend of Pyramus and Thisbe (Figs. 2, 29, 68) as recounted by Ovid in his Metamorphoses. The allegory of Chastity overcoming Lust is illustrated by the Ovidian story of Apollo pursuing the nymph Daphne transformed into a laurel tree as the amorous chase draws to a close (Fig. 13), and mainly by the story of Acteon (Fig. 2) who accidently surprises the goddess Diana at her bath and is punished for his glimpse of divine nudity by being turned into a stag and torn to pieces by his own hounds. The few boxes with religious scenes were perhaps intended as gifts to devout persons or as part of sacristy furnishings. The representation of the Santa Casa of Loreto on one of them (Fig. 34), is a devotional image to which Pope Julius II gave special impetus and promi- nence especially from 1507 onwards. The style of decoration of these pastiglia boxes which have so far come to our attention - and whose size varies from imposing, 25.4x40.6x27.6 cm. (Fig. 14), to large, 20.3X29.9X21.5 cm. (Fig. 8), with an average box of 10. 5 X 16 X 10. 5 cm. (Fig. 19), and small examples such as the round one in Berlin (Fig. 9) measuring 9 cm. in diameter - falls into broad categories which we suggest correspond to the produc- tion of seven different workshops presently identified by a characteristic trait or a specific casket. Our grouping is as follows: (1) the Workshop of the Judgment of Solo- mon (Figs. 36, 38) with five caskets; (2) the Workshop of the Main Berlin Casket (Figs. 14, 53) with eight examples; (3) the Workshop of the Cleveland Casket (Figs. 5-8, 10, 24, 70-71) with eleven boxes; (4) the Workshop of the Amor-Ecouen Casket (Figs. 1, 23, 28) with eight examples; (5) the Workshop of the Roman Triumphs (Figs. 18, 66) with ten examples; (6) the Workshop of the Moral and Love Themes (Figs. 2,9, 12-13, 16, 19-20, 22, 25-26, 30-31, 34, 39, 41, 43-45, 50-52, 68), by far the most industrious, with fifty-seven examples, that is, half of the total number of caskets inventoried; (7) and the Workshop of the Long Figures (Figs. 29, 32-33) with ten examples. Two uni- quely shaped boxes - the urn-like piece in the Collec- tion of Mrs. Ruth Blumka which will be brought up further on, and the casket with a high chimney lid ornamented with planet deities and now in London (Catalogue no. 63) - as well as the related example in Florence (no. 35) and a box in Vienna (no. 113), by the distinctiveness of their decoration cannot be included in the production of any of these shops. The style of the Judgment of Solomon Workshop is characterized by an array of heavily worked but crisp and delicate pastiglia elements producing an extremely ornate open lace- work effect. Narrative scenes here are populated by many closely set and often evidently re- petitive type figures disposed on a single horizontal line. The Main Berlin Casket Workshop produced boxes which are even more richly ornamented. No surface has been left bare as a wealth of decorative patterns and motifs are strikingly juxtaposed. Crowd scenes, very successfully rendered, are dense with minute figures grouped on multiple planes. By contrast, the Cleveland Casket Workshop, while producing equally sumptuous effects, uses a more sober ornamentation characterized by stronger forms and less bizarre elements. Figure types, identifiable from casket to casket, are given more freedom of space allowing for a greater variety of move- ments which stimulate attention to individual scenes. With the Amor-Ecouen Workshop, whose use of recur- ring ornamental elements such as the flower and un- dulating vine pattern on the pilasters is repeated from casket to casket, the narrative and picturesque decidedly take precedence over the ornamental intent. Figure types here too reapper from one box to another, with their unmistakably puppet-like heads slightly cocked and with prominently outlined features. The individual production of the workshops of the Roman Triumphs, of the Moral and Love Themes, and of the Long Figures, made very consistent use of easily discernable figurines, motifs and compositions. The Roman Triumphs Shop, to divide scenes, uses characteristic cross-hatched columns fanned by flame- like leaves; it also frequently uses an undulating vine border and a repeated under-rim pattern for the lid. The unmistakable figure type, gesturing with some angular awkwardness, is almost a trademark of the shop. The Long Figures Workshop, whose caskets are indeed characterized by tall, often lanky figures, also displays a predilection for large and bold ornamental motifs. Used sparingly on account of their size, these stand out very effectively against an often darkly-painted ground. The catalogue we have compiled, it is assumed, comprises only a fraction of the pastiglia boxes which</page><page sequence="7">14 DE Winter - THE WHITE LEAD PASTIGLIA BOX were made some four hundred and fifty years ago. One workshop though, it is obvious, had the largest share of the market for such objects. It is that of the Moral and Love Theme. Its creations are highly characteristic with large figures sparsely arranged, the primary concern being an easily read narrative. The somewhat stocky figures, some of which are anachronistically attired in sixteenth-century folkloric costumes, are arranged fron- tally to look out into our space as if perfoming. They gesture emphatically and trod in flexing motion in arrested poses. Closely studied, the decorative structure of these boxes by the various shops often reveals itself as an amazing tour de force . The four scenes of the Cleveland casket, for example (Figs. 6-8, 10), are composed of only about twenty different molded forms. These, how- ever, are so arranged and bent in various ways, owing to their original plastic property, that without close scrutiny they hardly appear as if constructed of repeti- tive elements. In the battle scene (Fig. 8), for example, only two basic molds are employed to represent horses: one of the animal facing toward the left, another towards the right, both being in a charging stance. The two fallen horses in the foreground are also issued from these same molds, the only difference being that their hind legs have been bent nearly at a right angle. By another artful ply, one of the animals has its head raised to evoke suffering, a familiar device in antique reliefs and mosaics which the makers of the box naturally wished to con- note. The frontal horses are simply casts from the right mold, collapsed and flattened out. The very same prac- tice also came into play for human figurines as well as, naturally, for all ancillary implements which appear either full, cut, or appended to others in order to suit the occasion. With the Workshop of the Moral and Love Themes, whose style is characterized by comparatively large and readable forms, we can most easily follow the 'typographical process' where the cast of a mold recurs in a great many scenes. Therefore, the townscape as back- ground for Orpheus playing his music (Fig. 39) appears repeatedly for example in such unrelated subjects as Marcus Coriolanus entreated by his wife and mother outside the walls of Rome (Fig. 19) or the Annunciation (Fig. 41). The very same molded human figurines, like actors of a small opera company, are made to imperso- nate the type role according to the circumstance: that of the heroine appearing as Thisbe (Figs. 2, 68), then reappering as Judith, Lucretia (Fig. 20), Daphne (Fig. 13), or, among this almost endless repertoire, the wife of Coriolanus (Fig. 19). Dressed in a wide mantle, the continent Scipio (Fig. 30) assumes no lesser a role than that of the abducted Europa (Fig. 31) and that of Chastity (Fig. 26) on her triumphal cart. The good- natured lancer, dressed in a fashionable sixteenth- century Venetian costume who is part of the chorus-like group in the scene of the torment of Atilius Regulus (Fig. 12) and other solemn occasions, reappears in equally good cheer as Apollo in pursuit of arboraceous Daphne (Fig. 13). At times, a whole group was produced from a single mold, surrounded by different ornaments and occasion- ally in a new context. This is true, for example, of the two scenes set in large medallions forming the principal ornamentation of a very handsome box (Figs. 20, 43) decorated by the Workshop of Moral and Love Themes which is by far the most intent on picturesque narrative. The group of the sleeping nymph watched by two satyrs recurs in almost identical terms, including the rounded bottom edge of the medallion mold, with the tree then shifted slightly to the right and the bird missing, on the short side of four a more modest boxes (Catalogue nos. 14, 61, 107, 112) with variations occuring only in the cast of supernumeries called in with little forethought to fill the lateral voids occasioned by the rectangular field. In one such box at the Victoria and Albert Museum (Fig. 44), the additions consist of a man and a woman, boisterously exclaiming at the impudent lasciviousness of the goat-footed beings. The same satyrs further ap- pear on three other boxes produced by the same shop. On one, part of the drapery now supports the child in a scene that seems to relate to Bacchus and on another the hirsute fellows are astraddle an elephant (Fig. 45) while still holding the babe. For the occasion they have been plied and flattened out as in the case of the frontally-seen horse on the Cleveland casket. Peripatetic, these merry creatures appear probably as a connotation of Vanitas on the left of a representation of the suicide of Pyramus and Thisbe. Here the first satyr holds an oval convex object, perhaps a mirror. The scene of the second medallion, a firce battle in low relief (Fig. 43), recurs as principal element on the opposite end of the Victoria and Albert Museum box (Fig. 50), graced by the scene of the sleeping nymph. The combat in this case is flancked by two out of scale legionnaires. On another box in Milan (Fig. 5 1), the same medallion scene with the addition of different figures may connote the Battle of the Amazons alongside a representation of the choice of Hercules. A same economy of basic forms is naturally also true in the use of purely ornamental motifs on the lids, bases,</page><page sequence="8">DE Winter -THE WHITE LEAD PASTIGLIA BOX 15 pilasters, or columns, etc., although the configuration of such elements very often makes for new effects. The craftsmen who produced the white lead pas- tiglia boxes obviously looked to other media for decora- tive as well as iconographie models which they in turn adapted. Made to enhance the home and to reflect a trend in fashion, the creation of these caskets bears many relationships to a variety of other objects conceived in the spirit of Antiquity. A few scenes more than echo classical monuments. The horses of the triumphal cart on the Cleveland casket (Catalogue no. 16, side III), for example, recall the reliefs of the Triumph of Titus on the arch dedicated to him, or that of Marcus Aurelius now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome, while the heroic figure with flying cape on a rearing horse and the adjoin- ing vaulted architecture on a box now in Milan (Fig. 52) reflect such models as the Trajanic reliefs on the Arch of Constantine (l l). More specific is the scene on an end of a large casket at the Victoria and Albert Museum (Fig. 53) which depicts the triumphal return to Rome of Titus after his conquest of Jerusalem in 70 AD as shown on a relief (Fig. 54) of the arch dedicated to that Emperor in the Roman Forum. The very configuration of the most elaborate pas- tiglia caskets recalls ancient monuments readily accessi- ble not only in Rome but elsewhere, such as the series of massive sarcophagi with narrative carvings made in late Roman and early Christian times for well-to-do mer- chants or minor officials. Such a monument is the trun- cated pyramid-shaped one (Fig. 55) now in the main court of the Palazzo Estense at Modena with narrative scenes, divided by pilasters, on the sides which pertain to the occupations of the person for whom it was de- stined, and with some ornamental motifs on the lid. This shape and decorative scheme had not actually been revived by the makers of white lead pastiglia boxes; the workshop of Baldassare and Antonio Embriachi, whose speciality had been the production of small caskets ornamented by multiple plaques of carved bone, had already adopted the truncated pyramid form (Fig. 56) after moving from Tuscany to Venice in 1400 where the activity of Antonio is recorded until 1431 (12). The reliefs of the Embriachi caskets, however, when not of a religious nature, had found their source in chivalric romances of the Medieval world, remote from the themes of ancient Rome. From the late Quattrocento, artists' use of Antiquity was increasingly influenced by collectors' taste for ob- jects «all'antica». Before the end of the fifteenth cen- tury, for example, the sculptor Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi had been employed by the Gonzagas to pro- duce bronze reductions of some of the most famous ancient statues in Rome and to create new works in the antique manner. His virtuousity in doing so earned him the epithet of 1'« Antico» (13). The antiquarian climate of this time is also illustrated by the decor if not the iconography drawn from Antiquity on other small bronzes as well: medals, plaquettes and a variety of utilitarian objects such as mortars, bowls, ink stands, bells and the like. The course of decoration of a bronze handbell of typical workmanship of the early sixteenth century (Fig. 57), for example, comprises many classical-revival motifs such as ancient swags, heraldic devices, and stylized fauna, as well as corded elements and palmette leaves around the rim not unlike those which grace several caskets such as the one in Cleveland. Padua was the first center where such re-creations and adaptions in bronze were made, the majority of early plaquettes, a principal medium for disseminating classi- cal or pseudo-classical themes and modes in often multiple copies, in fact being produced in this city. Classical ornaments such as the Gorgon's head over a swag attributed to the Paduan sculptor Severo da Ravenna, on a small plaquette (Fig. 58) and repeated on (n) For illustrations of the relief of Titus and that of Marcus Aurelius, see H. KÄHLER, Rom und seine Welt , Munich, 1958, pls. 160, 215. For the Trajanic relief on the Arch of Constantine, see ibid. , pl. 172. The scene on the London pastiglia casket bears relationship to an unascribed rectangular plaquette of the same subject dating of the sixteenth century now in the Palazzo Schifanoia, Ferrara (for which see R. VARESE, Giacchette e bronzi nelle civiche collezioni , Ferrara, 1975, p. 49, no. 36). (I2) Some of the pastiglia caskets also bear more than a passing relationship to a series of early Christian sarcophagi in Ravenna, particularly in the Museo Nazionale (see, for example, P. TOESCA, Storia dell1 arte italiana y I, Turin, 1927, p. 254, fig. 151; p. 255, fig. 152; C. RICCI, Raccolte artistiche di Ravenna , Bergamo, 1905, p. 119, fig. 92; p. 132, figs. 108-109).

HEIKAMP, L'Antico, Milan, 1966; BROWN, The Grotta of Isabella d'Esté , p. 163. The rising demand for antiquities provoked deliberate misrepresentations. A well-known case in point is that of the sleep- ing cupid, a youthful work of Michelangelo. This marble was purchased by the Roman dealer Baldassare del Milanese who, though fully aware of its provenance, sold it to Cardinal Riario as a genuine antique; later the statue passed into two other well-known collec- tions, that of Cesare Borgia and that of Isabella d'Este, the latter placing it in her Grotta among her finest objects (See L. GOLDSCHNEIDER, Michelangelo, Paintings, Sculptures, Architecture , London, 1953, p*. 204).</page><page sequence="9">16 DE Winter - THE WHITE LEAD PASTIGLIA BOX a number of other bronze objects produced shortly after 1500 such as a striking bronze bucket said to be of Venetian origin now in the collection of the Bargello (Fig. 40), find their ready counterparts in decorative motifs used on several pastiglia caskets, the lid of the Cleveland box (Fig. 59) being a prominent example. The near identity of forms between the seated Orpheus shown playing the lute on several pastiglia caskets (Fig. 39) and the same scene on the Bargello bucket (Fig. 40) including the flight of large birds, is yet another illustra- tion of the relationship of the pastiglia workshops with the bronze founders. The recurring townscape elements referred to earlier and which appear for example behind the seated Orpheus seem to bear more than a coinciden- tal relationship to plaquettes with scenic backgrounds as, for example, one representing a combat at a city gate (Fig. 42) produced by Riccio, the principal bronze sculptor of the Renaissance, active in Padua. Most of the scenes of mythology and Roman history which we mentioned in the previous pages, are portrayed in the bronze medium. It seems likely that the pastiglia mounted figure of Marcus Curtius throwing himself into the chasm (Fig. 16) and that of Horatius Codes defending the bridge (Fig. 18) are derivates of such subjects on plaquettes. An exceptionally deep bronze relief (Fig. 17) representing Marcus Curtius attributed to Riccio, which in turn might be based on a print, readily stands as such a possible direct model (14). The compositions which appear on two round pla- quettes (Figs. 46, 48-49) datable of the first years of the Cinquecento, recur verbatim on some of the boxes pro- duced by the Workshop of Moral and Love Themes. We have already discussed the two scenes in their pastiglia form as examples of a cluster of figures cast from a single mold. The relationship of scale and of rounded shapes between these pastiglia compositions and the two pla- quettes implies that the makers of the boxes had ready access to the bronze objects or perhaps even to the casting molds. One plaquette (Fig. 49), which dates of about 1503 representing the famed Battle of Cannae at which the Carthaginians under Hannibal defeated the Romans, is attributed to the Master of Coriolanus, an unknown artist whose style is related to that of Riccio and Moderno. This sculptor is believed to have been active either in Venice or in Padua. In the pastiglia versions (Figs. 43, 50-5 1), the lower part of the rounded field with the commemorative inscription has either been left bare or filled with a course of stones. Above, a lanky tree dominates the same city, but the proud banner of the bronze is now transformed, espousing the shape of what may seem to be a predatory crane (15). The second of these plaquettes (Figs. 46, 48), repre- senting the sleeping nymph with two satyrs, is in itself a fairly accurate copy of a print (Fig. 47) by Benedetto Montagna, a North Italian painter and engraver active around 1500. The plaquette, known in two slightly different versions, has been attributed to the Pseudo-Fra Antonio da Brescia, a conventional name for a sculptor likely to have worked in Venice at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Though both versions of the plaquet- tes are identical in scale and in quality, one, the less readily found (Fig. 46), shows, as in the Montagna print (Fig. 47), an inconspicuous ornamental design on the main surface of the structure against which the nymph rests her head, while in the second version (Fig. 48), the word VIRTVS has been added within the cartouche- like design as if to lend a moralistic overtone to a purely pagan and lusty subject. The alteration must have been made rather early as only three out of the ten known examples of the plaquette are without the added word (16). Despite the usual moralistic handling of topics by the Workshop, the pastiglia medallions (Figs. 43-44, see also Catalogue no. 107) reproduce the first version of the plaquette, which may then possibly sug- (,4) For numerous parallels, see, for example, the plaquettes repertoried in J.

The relation- ship of Renaissance niello plaques to bronze plaquettes is another area in which little investigation appears to have been conducted. Niello plaques 1845.8.25.94-6 in the British Museum, Allegory of Victory, David with the Head of Goliath, Hercules and Caucus, are in turn direct copies of compositions in bronze by the North Italian sculptor Moderno.

In addition to the use, pointed out by Mid- deldorf, of the plaquette on ink stands, it may be noted that a round cast is incorporated in a North Italian binding produced between 1503-1527 (now in the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris). The text, PHILOSTRATUS, De vita Apollonii Tyanaei, libro octo&gt; of 1501-04, was printed in Venice and the binding would also appear to be of Venetian workmanship. See G.D.

A production of the Workshop of the Judgment of Solomon with its white lead pastiglia reliefs stained rather than left in its original state (Fig. 36) appears as if a conscious attempt to imitate impressive bronze pla- ques. It is generally true, however, that the handling of scenes on the white lead pastiglia boxes retains less consistently the purity of the classical spirit for which the plaquette-makers strove. For example, the classi- cally derived pathos and the semi-nudity of Lucretia (Fig. 2 1) as she is about to stab herself on a plaquette by Moderno finds unequal correspondence in white lead pastiglia compositions by the Workshop of the Cleve- land Casket (Fig. 5), while the subject is given an uninspired turn by the Workshop of Moral and Love Themes (Fig. 20) where Lucretia becomes a buxom creature prudishly arrayed in an unsophisticated costume. The most unusual among our series of pastiglia boxes, the urn-shaped piece owned by Mrs. Blumka in New York (Figs. 27, 61), is also of the highest quality. The material of which the tall figures are built appears to be a compound of white lead and sulphate, but it may well be, on account of its somewhat softer effect, that the content of white lead is lower here. The style of decoration of this object, which may have an aulic origin, relates, by the size and masterly articulation of the figures, to two front panels (Fig. 62) of cassoni now in Klagenfurth. These were brought North from Man- tua in 1477 as part of the baggage of Paola Gonzaga, daughter of Marquis Lodovico, on the occasion of her marriage to Leonard, Count of Görtz. The panels are decorated with large gesso reliefs of the Justice of Trajan (17). The archaeological grasp of these scenes combined with the provenance of the reliefs, suggests that the foremost artist of the Antique revival, Andrea Mantegna, had a hand in their design though not in their execution which was entrusted to a follower, perhaps Luca Fancelli. Andrea Mantegna, an artist of unsurpassed inventiveness and technical skill, investi- gated all aspects of classical, and especially Roman, culture with greater emphasis on archaeological accu- racy than any other artist of his time, yet transcending a purely antiquarian attitude. Raised in Padua by the artist-entrepreneur Francesco Squarcione who owned what was perhaps the very first collection of casts after antique statues, Mantegna had soon been lured to be- come the artist-in-residence of the court of the Gon- zagas, which more than any other in Europe professed a vibrant interest in the acquisition not only of antiquities but also of copies made after the Antique. In the 1460s Mantegna painted a series of busts of Roman emperors in illusionistic grisaille set in garlands, scrolled ribbons and other classically inspired motifs, against a gold ground on the ceiling of the Camera degli sposi (Fig. 63) in the ducal palace at Mantua. The whole, quite stupendous indeed, produces an effect partly duplicated in small-scale by the white pastiglia ornaments on the gold gounds of our boxes. In the late 1470s the artist began his famous set of large panels of the Triumph of Caesar which, completed some twenty years later, would be an iconographie milestone in Renaissance culture (18). Andrea Mantegna, who, we suggest, had some involvement in the design of the urn-shaped pas- tiglia box, also created iconographie models which were to be used, if through intermediaries, by the white lead pastiglia industry in general. In his famous re-creation in prints of the world of bellicose sea gods (Fig. 60), the central figure astride a rearing maritime horse may be at the source of such a detail as the similar, but more decoratively rendered figure on the lid of the Cleveland casket (Figs. 7, 59). The stoic act of Mucius Scaevola (Fig. 10) appears to have been visually created by the Engravings y Part II, vol. V, London, 1948, pp. 173-186; vol. VI, pls. 736-769. Montagna's Sleeping Nymph may already have been influenced by a woodcut in the famous Hypnerotomachia Polifili of Colonna printed in Venice in 1499 (for an illustration of the woodcut, see, for example, M. CALVESI, Il Sogno di Polifilo prene- stino , Rome, 1980, p. 158, fig. 21). For two versions of this plaquette see E.

It is also Mantegna who first saw Solomon as an imperial figure surrounded by all the trappings of Rome (Fig. 37). Divine Judith (DIVA IVDIT), holding the severed head of Holofernes, was more firmly entrenched in Renaissance iconography by the engravings (Fig. 15) that Zoan Andrea and Girolamo Mocetto made of Man- tegna s composition than by those of any other artist. Zoan Andrea, who had no compulsion about plagiariz- ing Mantegna' s compositions, for which the Master finally retorted by sending ruffians one night to assault him on the streets of Mantua, produced incisively-cut prints which could serve as models for those who, like the makers of the white lead pastiglia caskets, were readily in need of motifs (19). Prints were a chief medium through which know- ledge of Antiquity was to spread. After 1500 they became increasingly numerous, diffusing classical, pseudo-classical as well as religious scenes garbed in the spirit if not the attire of the Ancients, and soon also making known the grotteschi ornamental motifs redis- covered by Raphael's followers as well as the Vitruvian architectural orders. Nielli prints, with their particular emphasis on decorative values, and woodcuts and en- gravings which were produced either as single works or as illustrations of books from the very end of the fifteenth century into the second quarter of the sixteenth century were often a source of inspiration to makers of bronze plaquettes, though borrowings from these were generally less flagrant than in the case of the sleeping nymph and satyrs we have examined. Prints naturally also served as logical models for the eclectic craftsmen who made white lead pastiglia caskets. Girolamo Mocetto, for example, a painter and engraver of Murano who died in 1531, in his Battle Between Israel and the Amalekites (Fig. 64) displays a definition of individual forms, a symmetry of movement, and an academism close to many of the relief scenes of the caskets. The engraver's fallen figure about to be trampled on the left of the print is identical in pose to the one at center of the battle scene of the Cleveland box (Fig. 8) and the high helmet of the King of the Amalekites on the right of the print explains the often-seen anachronistic chako worn by the determined military man in battle (Fig. 20) or in crowd scenes, such as the torment of Atilius Regulus (Fig. 12), of the pastiglia caskets. The scantily dressed athlete behind the maiden who appears before Scipio (Fig. 30) is closely related to the warrior who shields his face at the extreme right of Mocetto's print. The panoplies of military men on our various caskets, if strongly Roman in flavor, are by and large as un- archaeological as those of Mocetto and other contem- poraries. They are, however, close in type to those of Mantegna's Triumph of Caesar paintings in Hampton Court, while the helmets are similar to that of the well-known equestrian statue of Verrocchio's Colleoni in Venice with the addition of feathers, as in the composi- tion of Mocetto (20). In 1504, a woodcut engraver from Alsace who signed his works 'Jacobus Argentoratensis Germanus', produced in Venice a series of prints (Fig. 65) of the triumphs of Julius Caesar. These, perhaps designed by Benedetto Bordone of Padua, derive both in subject matter and in style from the famous set of Mantegnesque paintings (21). The incisive lines of the woodcuts as well as the simplification of forms made in the rendering of the Mantuan models, results in clearly delineated groups which in turn provided ready models to a variety of highly skilled craftsmen, from makers of pastiglia caskets to painters of majolica plates, as is best illus- trated by a large dish with Roman standard bearers at the Louvre (22). Within the production of the pastiglia boxes, the Workshop of the Roman Triumphs was (l9) C.

A common affinity for pristine forms and incisively drawn ornaments may be pointed out between the pro- ductions of the Cleveland Casket Workshop and a series of niello prints of the early sixteenth century signed «Peregrines». The series of engravings produced by Marcantonio Raimondi and his followers such as Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio, were, needless to say, prime diffusero of classical motifs and iconography (23). A contemporary print was no doubt to serve as model for one of the few religious subjects on caskets, that representing the Santa Casa of Loreto (Fig. 34), a well-known pilgrimage site of sixteenth-century Italy. By 1507 Pope Julius II had given new impetus to the cult and to the building program of the new basilica erected to enshrine the house. Participating in the ex- ecution of the project were such famous artists as the Venetian architect Andrea Sansovino. A number of de- votional prints serving as record of the pilgrimage were then produced (Fig. 35), showing, as in the case of the white lead pastiglia scene, the house supported by angels and crowned by the seated Virgin holding the child (24). When printed for a wider public than Humanists, books were soon given illustrations. From the last de- cade of the fifteenth century, these woodcut inserts became a ready medium for spreading the popularity of literary themes in visual terms. The woodcut series in the 1497 edition of Oviďs Metamorphoses printed in Venice by Giovanni Rosso for the editor Lucantonio Giunta, the edition in Italian of Livy's History of Rome printed in the same city in 1493, and the masterpiece of the famed printer Aldo Manuzio, the Hypnerotomachia Polifili of Francesco Colonna, issued in Venice in 1499, were to provide easily accessible compositions soon pilfered and adapted not solely by other publishers for their own editions, but also by the well-known case of the engraver Benedetto Montagna and by many artists in the decorative arts (25). As far as pastiglia caskets are concerned, some mythological themes and more specifically those treated by Ovid, as well as the layout of some of the fierce battles, were influenced by book illustrations, but to our knowledge the compositions were never extracted in- toto. Indeed, editions of Livy more than bronze plaquet- tes seem to have provided schemes (Fig. 67) for a field built up of warring combattants (Fig. 1), while a mythological theme such as the Death of Pyramus and Thisbe, appears on many caskets (Fig. 68) composed of closely related basic elements as those in woodcuts of the same subject (Fig. 69) - the fallen hero, the bereaved Thisbe about to impale herself on the long sword, the nearby fountain, the lion italico passant, and the distant cityscape - though admittedly they are arranged in a different manner. Both the technical limitations on the pastiglia scene combined with the difficulty of repre- senting recession of planes without foreshortened figures and the need for mobility of elements to avoid, or else for intended, superimpositions, are factors that obviously came into play. All boxes with white lead pastiglia decoration - except for the Blumka urn and the high chimney planet- ary box - interrelated not only by their compound but also by their shape and their decorative elements, as our Catalogue will further emphasize, must have been pro- duced, there is very little doubt, within a same district and very probably in fact in the same city. The place of manufacture of the boxes and the date they were made has by and large been the subject of only some con- jecture. Florence, Perugia, Padua, Venice, and Ferrara are among centers proposed, but generally with little support (26).

As for precise dating, only one piece - a box of rather high quality but somewhat modest in size at the Victoria and Albert Museum (Fig. 70, Catalogue no. 55) - furnishes concrete evidence. Its lid (Fig. 71) prominently bears the shield of Bernard Cles, Bishop of Trent, surmounted by a cardinal's hat and flanked by the motto UNITAS over a faggot of seven rods which he used as a personal emblem. Cles had been elected to the purple in 1530. In 1538, one year before his death, the Pope also named him Bishop of Bressanone, and on that occasion Cles altered his arms (27). The shield on the box is that of the Cardinal before his ultimate nomination and therefore can be dated of the period 1530- 1538. It is identical to the blazon found on the bronze bell which is placed in front of the Cardinal in a contemporary por- trait (Fig. 72) painted by a follower of Joos van Cleve. Cles, a successful jurist, was known for his learning and for his protection of Humanists, as well as for being a lavish prince of the Church who aspired to leave a mark on his See (28). The box, we consider, was probably commissioned as a gift for him and this might well have occurred in 1530 in honor of his elevation to the cardina- late. The activity of the white lead pastiglia casket indus- try, then, seems to have begun shortly after 1503 (as we have seen from examples such as the productions of the Workshop of Solomon and those of the Workshop of Moral and Love Themes, which derive most of their inspiration from models dating from the very late fifteenth century) and have extended to the 1530s with late examples such as the Cles box by the Cleveland Casket Workshop, lasting, that is, probably less than a generation. If the Cles box provides a date range, how- ever, there is little point in attempting to link the white lead pastiglia casket industry to Trent itself. There would hardly have been a market for such objects there. Cles himself frequently travelled, especially in the axis of the Veneto, and was befriended by a host of North Italian aristocrats, colleagues, and Humanists. All the evidence that we have gathered so far does, however, assuredly point to Northeastern Italy, and particularly to the Veneto as place of origin for the white lead pastiglia caskets. The Renaissance had come from Florence to North Italy by and large through Padua where Donatello came to work at the Santo. The earlier Florentine emphasis on line, form, and tactile values now combined this mastery with a study of the art of Antiquity. Padua was a city which harbored many Humanists, and where, for example, were visually de- picted, by Altichiero, the earliest representations of Petrarchian themes (29). After the Venetian conquest, Padua and Venice became united. While Padua s uni- versity, which became Venice's own, guaranteed con- tinued intellectual prestige for the former, the tide was obviously turning, and shortly before the very begin- ning of the Cinquecento, Venice was increasingly be- coming not only the place to publish but to be active in the visual arts. Among the larger cities of Italy, Venice also had its own Humanists receptive to Antiquity. During the Quattrocento, however, their interest had mostly been of an archaeological nature rather than responding to the re-creation of antique objects in Roman style; the Vene- tians, as part of their spirit of insular indépendance, did not consider themselves as descending from the Ro- mans. This conservatism, however, broke down rapidly, and by the last decade of the fifteenth century Venice was attracted to all aspects of Antiquity. When Dürer was in Venice in 1506, he was told that his work, not being in the ancient manner, was therefore no good (30). The concourse of a spiraling economic growth, of inquiring minds, and of artistic talents drawn from all of North Italy, not to say the whole of Europe, made Venice, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, a veritable emporium which, like Paris in the early fifteenth and twentieth centuries, distilled into distinct chromatic hues an array of unorchestrated colors.

Pietro Barbo, a Venetian who became Pope Paul II (1467-7 1), had been among early connois- seurs of antiquities. Cardinal Domenico Grimani (1493-1523), son of the doge Antonio, had a collection of antique sculptures, as did his nephew Giovanni, the patriarch of Aquileia who resided in Venice. See B. FORLATI TAMARO, Il Museo archeologico del Palazzo reale dì Venezia , Rome, 1953, p. 3. Among Venetian humanists must also be cited the well-known Pietro Bembo.</page><page sequence="14">DE Winter - THE WHITE LEAD PASTIGLIA BOX 21 cally too, the Serenissima was at this juncture at its most triumphant hour. If some purists among the Humanists grumbled that letters were not properly appreciated in Venice since everyone was absorbed in making money, their comment was simply an academic one, for the most successful among them in Italy were turning to this city to publish their works and to obtain the best editions of the classics. From about 1503 until 1567, Venice fostered printing and artistic enterprises on a scale unmatched anywhere else in the sixteenth century. The luxury of Venetian furniture produced, mostly on the island of Burano, from the end of the Quattrocento and through the next century, was highly reputed. Though dignified in forms, it was more grace- ful and harmonious than its Tuscan counterpart with an emphasis on a rich surface decoration in which the use of low relief predominates. The fact that lighter species of wood were more readily available in Venice than thick oak, may well have partly wrought this characteristic. Pilasters and panels were carved and painted, often with subjects or motifs drawn from Antiquity. The Venetian emphasis for decorative opulance is also translated in pictorial intarsia work and in some frames made for mirrors or to enhance reliefs or paintings. These frames are decorated with low reliefs said to be built of gesso sottile or rice flour paste and which, like the decoration of our caskets, is inspired from classical Antiquity (31). All the white lead pastiglia boxes we have examined are also made of extremely light wood. We suspect that they are probably fairly consistently made of the same species. The wood of the Cleveland casket, for example, has been analyzed in a laboratory and reveals itself to be alder (Latin: alnus glutinosa or ontano in Italian). This tree reaches about twenty-five meters in height and like poplars grows in areas where the soil is very humid. The country surrounding the Venetian laguna is a fertile ground for such growths. Much of the Venetian furni- ture was made out of its wood which is easy to work and yet quite strong. It is still used today for gondola òars. The Venetian Republic in the sixteenth century harbored expanding industries and looked with favor to the development of new enterprises. In addition to the furniture-making in Burano, also of interest for our topic are the arms made at the smelts of San Giorgio. Highly skilled silversmiths were required to make armor and cannons decorated with engraved and niello designs which made the adjective «Venetian» famous. Perhaps we are to consider some of the makers of the most skillful molds for white lead pastiglia decoration as belonging to this profession. The island of Murano, another center of productivity in Venice, was well- known for the kilns of its important glass manufactur- ing and metalurgical industry. Among other products made on the island, of particular interest here are lead moveable types for printing presses. That white lead was so extensively used for the ornamentation of our caskets would appear to be an indication that it was a by- product of an important metalurgical industry. It may be noted that a «bianco di Venezia» - or white lead of Venice, made of white lead mixed with a percentage of sulphate of barium - had been known in past centuries in Italy (32). This compound corresponds to the chemical analysis performed on samples taken from some of the caskets. According to an authoritative reference work, Venice in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance had a relative monopoly on white lead (33) which it assumedly could maintain since the ore was not found on the Italian peninsula. As had been true of Roman times, the metal was imported, and Venice, as an extension of the profit brought by her fleet, laid hands on as many monopolies as possible. As we have seen, most evidence for the manufacture of the caskets points to Venice. The primary anvil of their inception had been Padua with the sculptors con- nected with the Santo and then early bronzes of classical subjects. The Court of Mantua, through Mantegna, provided some of the grandiose concepts with a new iconography, and the adaptations on cassoni panels of classical scenes with three-dimensional figures in gesso. It is astraddle the visual arts, the furniture crafts, and the smelting industry, not to forget an easy interest in classical subjects, that the production of the white lead pastiglia caskets seems to find its happiest conjunction. Since these boxes were produced without great diffi- culty, their makers probably looked to satisfy a fairly large market. No city could combine this set of factors with greater ease than Venice. Another revealing aspect which comes as a conclu- (3I) For Venetian furniture of the period see ALBERICI, Il Mobile veneto, pp. 41-93, esp. pp. 56-57, fies. 67-68.

This in turn is but another indication of the very thorough penetration and absorption of classical ideals and forms in the Renaissance world.
