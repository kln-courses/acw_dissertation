<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY AIZANOI, 19821 The excavations of 1982 were concentrated on the large freestone building on the Meydan kiran in the village on the east bank of the river, in which in 1980 and 1981 a mosaic floor had been found with geometric decoration and a central panel of satyr and maenads. This building consists of a thermal complex with natatio. The latter was built into an already existing older structure at the end of the 2nd century; the purpose of this older building could not be determined. The great pillared hall with the mosaic was restored and covered with a roof for protection. The excavation of the Dorian agora was continued and the columned portico at the north-east corner was investigated. In the eastern portico of the court is a trapezoidal exedra and against this on the eastern side of the portico lie rooms of unequal size which were evidently accessible from the quay on the Rhyndacus. Here, at a depth of 1-60 m. below the level of the stylobate, the first remains of a Hellenistic ashlar wall to be found at Aizanoi came to light, and by it moulded Hellenistic relief-pottery and fragments of terracotta statuettes. On the river bank in the axis of the agora was found a square statue-base, 1-36 m. in height, having on its surface sockets for two human feet and on both sides traces of attachments for side panels. The pedestal was thus set up in the parapet on the quay wall. On its front is a Greek inscription of 27 lines, in honour of Marcus Ulpius Appuleianus and his son Eurycles, a man known from the inscriptions on the cella wall of the Temple of Zeus, an eminent organizer of the festival games of Zeus and a benefactor of the city. The inscription was erected in the open-air museum beside the Temple of Zeus. A start was made with the surveying and investigation of the architectural remains of Stadium and Theatre, and restorations were carried out in the ruins of the great Thermal Gymnasium. ANEMURIUM, see p. 263 APHRODISIAS, 19822 The Sebasteion The unusual significance of the building complex dedicated to the cult of Augustus and his Julio-Claudian successors made a continuation of excavation in three of its component parts mandatory. These investigations yielded crucial information about several details concerning the structure and its layout, as well as a rich harvest of sculptural and epigraphical material. The areas involved in- cluded (1) the western ends of the two parallel, three-storeyed porticoes as well as the propylon, or gateway, which had been detected there in 1981; (2) the western half of the north portico; and (3) the eastern end of the complex, where a temple or sanctuary is presumed to have been located. Excavations of the propylon and its vicinity were partly hindered by water evacuation problems. It was nevertheless possible to use a pump and discover that the gateway consisted of two central units, or "pylons," located in the western extremity of the paved area between the two porticoes and connected with these at a slightly obtuse angle. The "pylons" were separated from one 1 Translated from information kindly provided by Professor R. Naumann. 2 Condensed from a report kindly provided by Professor Kenan Erim.</page><page sequence="2">ANATOLIAN STUDIES another and the porticoes by three flights of stairs descending westward towards the Agora and what may be a street leading south towards the Theatre. They featured two storeys, decorated with Ionic columns with reed fluting in the lower order, and regular Corinthian ones in the upper level. The western side of the gateway, i.e., towards the Agora presented an aediculated faCade composed of several niches, or recesses, and projections, including a system of half pediments crowning the upper order. The eastern end facing the inner Sebasteion, on the other hand, showed a linear, unbroken architrave and superstructure. This was prompted by the need to join physically this face of the propylon with the north and south porticoes, to conceal the disparity in architectural orders as well as to provide a unified appearance to the architraves. Since they were higher than the gateway itself, the western ends of the porticoes probably resembled towers framing the propylon, as one approached the Sebasteion from the Agora. The same dedicatory inscription proved to have been carved on both inner and outer faces of the gate. Decorated with a stunning series of theatrical masks, the architrave blocks stated that the propylon was presented "to Aphrodite, the Divine Augusti and the People." The dedicating family seems to have been the same one that was involved with the construction of the north portico and should be placed in the 1st century. Several inscribed bases and statue fragments decorating the niches of the western facade of the gate were retrieved. They included those of Lucius and Gaius Caesar, the two grandsons of Augustus, of Drusus Caesar, son of the emperor Tiberius, of Aeneas, and of Aphrodite herself identified as "prometor" (ancestral mother) "of the Divine Augusti." Additional sculpture recovered here featured a handsome, large draped female torso and two fragmentary reliefs showing Dionysus with a satyr. Two stray pieces of an im- portant, but later inscribed, panel also found in this area did not bear on the Sebasteion directly. The document appears to be part of a letter of the emperors Valerian and Gallienus to an individual, presumably an Aphrodisian, and, if eventually completed, should provide welcome evidence for 3rd century history. Excavations along the western half of the north portico confirmed the impression of damage caused here by an earthquake, first probably in the 2nd century, followed by a more catastrophic one in the 7th century. After this, Byzantine pilfering led to the reuse of many column and architrave fragments in the fortification wall blocking the back of the Theatre stage. Nevertheless, despite these depredations, many relief fragments and inscribed "trompe l'oeil" bases pertaining to the symbolic representations of the peoples of the Empire decorating the upper intercolumniations of the portico were discovered. The partly preserved bases included the names of several Balkanic peoples, the lapodes, the Dardani, the Andizeti and the Pirystae. The appearance here of names that are rarely encountered in ancient texts, if at all, beside Strabo, naturally raised questions about the sources for contemporary history available in 1st century Aphrodisias. A handsome, well-preserved relief featuring a fully armed young woman symbolizing the Pirystae (according to a graffito carved next to the figure) was recovered not far from its base. Another stunning, large relief panel was found in one of the central "rooms" of the north portico. However, it was more likely part of the decoration of the opposite south portico. Since it was discovered face down near a backwall, it may have been intentionally secreted here because of the identities of the two figures shown on it. These portray a woman, in the guise of a Tyche, holding a cornucopia, to the right, crowning a young man in military dress, to the left. Tentative suggestions concerning the persons represented here seem to point to 232</page><page sequence="3">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY Agrippina, the Elder (?), honouring one of her sons, perhaps, Drusus or Nero Caesar, or even Gaius (the emperor Caligula). Several trenches were also dug along the north-eastern area of the north portico and brought interesting new evidence about the later building thought to be circular, hence tentatively labelled a rotunda in 1981, and intruding in the north-eastern section of the Sebasteion. This structure proved to be not circular but the large, irregular apsidal end of a hall in basilica plan, judging from an adjoining, lateral wing uncovered to its west. The latter also ended in a southern apse and featured traces of opus sectile floors. In an as yet indeterminate con- text, immediately outside this west aisle, two striking statues were found, un- ceremoniously dumped by a wall. One showed a man, or prince, in full military dress, including a scaled cuirass, Nike-decorated greaves, a sword in his left hand and a quiver full of arrows by his right leg. The second, singularly elegant, repre- sented a young woman wearing a tunic belted under her breasts and a long cloak, or chlamys, tied by a fibula. In other words, she was a chlamydata figure, or feminine counterpart to the chlamydati, those officials' portrait statues typical of Aphrodisias in the 5th century. Unfortunately, both figures were headless, though traces of hair on the young woman's shoulders indicated that she wore long, curly hair. Several heads and bust fragments were recorded in the same general area as well as inside the "basilica." One portrayed a handsome middle-aged man who might conceivably be Julius Caesar. An attractive, well-preserved youthful male bust probably represented Gaius Caesar, while a finely modelled, draped, but headless one, must also be assigned a 1st century date. On the other hand, a large number of small, well-finished fragments in deep relief were recovered in the "basilica" and must be dated to the 3rd century. They included many male limbs as well as an attractive head, that must be related to representations of a young Herakles in his early labours, while several additional pieces undoubtedly belonged to a "punishment of Marsyas" group. Near the apse of the large hall of the "basilica," furthermore, numerous architectural elements of its interior decoration continued to be discovered. Among them, a semicircular pediment carved in the shape of a beautiful half-shell clearly pertained to one of the aedicu- lae decoration and acted as pendant to the beguiling birth of Aphrodite, found last year. Unfortunately, only a few fragments of the tondo or imago clipeata-type busts discovered in this area in 1981 were recovered. These included the upper part of the Pythagoras tondo and the lower head of Alcibiades, who was shown as a beardless, long-haired young man. Intensive sondages in the eastern end of the Sebasteion, beyond its parallel porticoes and the later flight of eastward ascending steps bridging them, brought to light several water-channels, probably of 5th century date intended to drain the area from flooding waters released by the earthquake of the late 4th century. The more significant developments registered here, however, were the discoveries of a crepis and parts of a stylobate, as well as large Corinthian column drums, capitals and architrave fragments. These clearly verified the presence of a large temple on higher ground here, at the eastern extremity of the Sebasteion, as previously suggested. A village house, partly sitting over these remains, ob- structed additional investigations. Since it was expropriated, a few years ago, and is, therefore, unoccupied, it will be possible to dismantle it and probe under- neath it in 1983. Several inscribed architrave blocks found accidentally in earlier years to the east of this house may belong to the temple. The elements that survived referred especially to Livia and Chlaudiis. 233</page><page sequence="4">ANATOLIAN STUDIES In respect to the overall epigraphical evidence and decorative scheme of the Sebasteion uncovered so far, it is now justifiable to state that these stress the dominance of Rome over the earth and imperial victories over peoples brought under Rome's control by Augustus as well as Claudius and Nero, all within a cosmic and mythological context. As to the general plan of the complex, one cannot help finding in it reminiscences of the Forum of Augustus in Rome and its imitations in Italy. However, the Aphrodisias Sebasteion betrays a tradition of its own, proclaiming the close affiliations of the city's goddess with the Julio- Claudian house, as well as with Rome. There can be no doubt that the cult of Aphrodite at Aphrodisias was intimately connected with the development of the Imperial cult. Restoration Activities An intensive restoration programme, focussing on the Sebasteion, the Theatre Baths and Tetrastoon (or "piazza") behind the Theatre stage was under- taken in October. Five columns and three pillars, two of which were of the "peopled scrolled" variety, were restored and reerected in the "Kaisersaal" of the Theatre Baths. Over twenty columns, complete or fragmentary, were reset on their bases in the four porticoes of the Tetrastoon. Close study also permitted the restoration of additional columns in both porticoes of the Sebasteion. Furthermore, over half of the inscribed eastern architrave of the north portico was replaced on its properly consolidated Doric colonnade, along with several relevant fragments of frieze and cornice. The large body of newly discovered and previously collected relief fragments from the Sebasteion excavations was continuously studied and reexamined. As a result, many panels were partly or completely restored. Among them, one must cite a Thetis offering his weapons to Achilles; Orestes(?) dragging Clytemnestra(?); a group of Herakles, Nessus and Deianira; Poseidon and Amphitrite(?) borne by Tritons; Polyphemus attacking Galatea(?) and several others. The Dandalas Valley Survey Planned already two years ago, but postponed for various reasons, the brief survey of the Dandalas River Valley, a tributary of the Maeander flowing to the southwest of Aphrodisias, but actually fed by several streams, including the Geyre Cay, closer to the ancient city, was undertaken in July. The principal aim of this survey was a search for possible traces of prehistoric occupation. One area along the upper eastern slopes of the valley yielded many surface sherds of Hacilar- type pottery, as well as some stone artifacts. Significant flint supplies were also reexamined near the eastern cliffs of the gorge carved by the river. It is hoped that the results of this work can be incorporated in the forthcoming Prehistoric Aphrodisias volume and that additional investigations in areas not covered by last summer's survey may be undertaken, including scrutiny of a large cave to the west of Aphrodisias. Incidentally, a number of later archaeological traces and evidence were recorded in the survey, including an inscribed, well-preserved Byzantine font, found near Yenice (ancient Antioch-on-the-Maeander) mention- ing a bishop of Antioch. Research and publication Other study and research projects progressed satisfactorily last year. Work on the classification of the large Late Roman hoard from Eymir was essentially completed by Professor Frederick Lauritsen. The same holds true for the corpus 234</page><page sequence="5">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY of Aphrodisias coinage independently continued by Dr. David MacDonald. Several unusual items were extracted from recent stray finds and their details were forwarded to him. Dr. Elizabeth Ettinghausen initiated an examination and preliminary classification of Byzantine glazed (including "sgraffiato") pottery and related Islamic ware found in the Sebasteion and its vicinity. Additional Byzantine stamped "unguentaria" were also duly recorded and photographed for the study and article on this type of material from Aphrodisias contemplated for publication in the Dumbarton Oaks Papers by Dr. Caroline Williams and Dr. John Nesbitt. The inventory and examination of all garlanded masks friezes, initiated by Mme Nathalie de Chaisemartin, two seasons ago, proceeded successfully. Her study of the numerous blocks found in 1937 by G. Jacopi in his excavation of the Portico of Tiberius and stored in the Izmir Museum was supplemented by a new, exhaustive photographic recording completed by Mr. M. Ali D6genci. On the other hand, the sarcophagus corpus entrusted to Dr. Fahri Isik approached publication stage. Restoration and/or removal of several mosaic pavements and fresco frag- ments continued under the guidance of Mr. Ali Cetin Idil. Thanks to dry weather conditions, the opus sectile floor of the Odeon orchestra was lifted at last and placed in storage. The new, overall survey plan of Aphrodisias, initiated several years ago by Mr. Adnan Sakar, was enhanced during his visit in October with the addition of the Sebasteion and other details recently brought to light. The long-awaited Aphrodisias and Rome epigraphical study of Miss Joyce M. Reynolds was published in a handsome volume by the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies in a monograph series of the Journal of Roman Studies. Subse- quently, Mme Jeannine Leon-Leurquin presented and successfully defended her study on the chipped-stone industries of prehistoric Aphrodisias at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes et Sciences Humaines in Paris. The dissertation of Mrs. Martha S. Joukowsky (Aphrodisias au sud-ouest de la Turquie durant les periodes du neolithique et du chalcolithique final) for the degree of Doctorat d'Etat and its equally successful defence in late June at the University of Paris I (Pantheon-Sorbonne) provided clear proof of the abilities of the candidate as well as the international recognition of the importance of her work and of the pre- historic evidence uncovered at Aphrodisias. All these three collaborators have indefatigably pursued their respective research projects over the summer. ARSLANTEPE, MALATYA, 19821 During the 1982 campaign at Arslantepe researches were extended into different superimposed levels in the south-western area of the huyiuk. Period VIA (Late Uruk-Jemdet Nasr). The last unexcavated section of the Temple (Building I), consisting of a narrow rectangular room (A77) communi- cating with the cella, was completely cleared. There numerous clay sealings, 130 bearing seal impressions, have been found all together in the filling of the room. This kind of find appears very similar to that from A206, the space in a wall of the Gate belonging to the same period (Building IV). Among the seal impressions one representing rampant animals linked by a design of interlacing ribbons shows Mesopotamian connections. 1 Information kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Alba Palmieri. 235</page><page sequence="6">ANATOLIAN STUDIES Period VIB (Corresponding to the archaic Early Dynastic phases). Excavations have concerned the best preserved level of this period. Two rooms pertaining to different buildings have been cleared, where, besides a great quantity of charred grains, pottery has been found typical of this period (plain simple ware, often with reserved slip decoration, and black burnished ware). The excavation on a peculiar area outside the buildings has been also extended, where numerous animal bones had been found in the past seasons. More bones (mostly sheep) have been discovered in situ in considerable amount near a small draining channel partly retaining a wooden lining made of hollowed out trunks. Period VID (Early Bronze III). Two circular subterranean dwellings very unusual in the Malatya-Elazlg region during this period, were brought to light; they apparently consist of a single room about 4 m. in diameter and are provided with stepped benches running along a mud-brick wall, which bounded the trench. Moreover a large quadrangular room was discovered, furnished with benches along the walls, and a hearth with a platform in front, while a circular mud-brick structure containing a large stone was probably the base of a central wooden post sustaining the roof. The materials from these levels include pottery typical of the period, such as red-black burnished ware and painted ware in the Malatya-Elazig style, and also some characteristic objects such as a pierced horn comb and a clay female figurine. Period VB (Late Bronze I). The remains of a terraced house of this period have been brought to light; it contained a great deal of pottery in situ, which can be related to Central Anatolian production. BESIGE BA Y, 19821 For over fifty years the Besige basin has been under discussion as a probable location for the harbour of the prehistoric settlements of Hisarlik. Results from the German research and excavation of 1924 together with the renewed efforts of 1981 and 1982 indicate that this zone, at present above sea level, indeed merits serious consideration. More recent geological research, Turkish and American, newly published as Supplementary Monograph 4 in the Troy series, confirms the legitimacy of the discussion. Geological, geographical, nautical, and peremptory logistical considerations all speak for the use of the bay as a harbour: here a natural supply of drinking water, the sea currents, and the prevailing winds are taken into account. The numerous ancient settlements of various date known to line the basin emphasize the need for archaeological investigation. There are as well two tumuli which stand as prominent landmarks there. Excavation in 1982 concentrated on the cape or peninsula to the north of the bay (Besige, Yassi Tepe) and the settlement immediately below to the east. It was clear from survey work in 1981 that we could expect to find here sub- stantial strata of the Troy I period - phases not so fully investigated at Troy itself - as well as a good-sized settlement of the late Troy VI period, not to mention overlying remnants from Hellenistic, Byzantine, and Ottoman times. The research project of the German Archaeological Institute was therefore begun in the area of the cape. Three soundings three metres and more in depth 1 Information kindly provided by Professor Da. Manfred Korfmann. 236</page><page sequence="7">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY were made in the lower settlement. First to be noted are the remains of simple domestic architecture which substantiate the presence of settlement in the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.CE. Underlying these we encountered in one trench a moder- ately large pit from the Troy VI period. The presence of some Mycenaean pot- tery as well as Gray Minyan Ware should be called to attention here. Five trenches were opened on the peninsula itself. The half of an Ottoman house was cleared. Beside this but stratigraphically deeper lay the ruins of a large Byzantine structure from the late 12th/early 13th centuries. The middle Hellenistic period (c. 200 B.C.E.) is represented by the founda- tions of an obviously massive structure with antae oriented eastward facing directly toward Besige-Sivri Tepe (the tumulus below which Schliemann in 1879 uncovered the strata reputed for Late Neolithic pattern-burnished ware). Only the foundations of this large building survived: those for the outer walls, pre- served to a maximum height of 0-80 m., measured no less than one metre across. Below this we encountered a level of smaller structures from the late 3rd century B.C.E. These had been built one very near another. One of the structures boasted a floor of paving stones. On the slope toward the mainland we encountered a sequence of forti- fications. The uppermost, from Byzantine times, showed traces of conflagration. Below appeared two impressive fortification walls which screened the acropolis off from the settlement below. The breadth of the upper wall was 1-60 m., that of the lower a full 2 m. A cobbled street leading to the interior indicates that an entrance way formerly existed there. Immediately under the pavement lay an undisturbed sequence of Troy I strata, which we were able to excavate to a depth of 1 10 m. by the end of the campaign. One stratum at least can be designated as a destruction level. The settlement, to judge from the finds, is from an earlier phase of the Troy I period. Further deep soundings on the peninsula indicate that this phase is to be found everywhere. In one trench we encountered a wall which had collapsed onto one side preserving thirteen courses of mudbrick. Here and there exist indications that a late Troy VI settlement as well had existed on the acropolis. Summarizing, one can say that the archaeological excavations in the area of Besige Bay will disclose distinctive cultural legacies from more than one signifi- cant period. Remnants of seaweed and seashells from one sondage far inland in the basin (near the area investigated in regard to the question of alluvium by O. Mey as early as 1924) clearly demonstrate that this region was formerly seabed. Layers of alluvium can be followed to a sandy floor at a depth of 4 m. All the bone material excavated in 1982 was classified during the campaign, and the small finds as well as the pottery were competently studied and recorded. All finds were surrendered to the museum responsible in Canakkale. BOGAZKOY, 19811 Excavations were continued both in the Upper City and at Yerkapi (Sphinx gate). In the Upper City investigations revealed further structures of Hittite origin, belonging to the third and second periods of settlement in the "Oberstadt" (layer Oberstadt 3 and 2). Oberstadt 3 presented three fairly regularly laid out, 1 Information kindly contributed by Dr. Peter Neve. 237</page><page sequence="8">ANATOLIAN STUDIES large isolated units of square plan with inner courtyards. Among them is another temple situated east of Sarlkale, Temple VII, which according to a sealed bulla dates to the time of Tuthalija IV (1250-1220 B.C.). Unlike "Oberstadt 3" the following period (O.St.2) shows poorly planned and built arrangements, which replaced parts of the former settlements and con- sisted mostly of workshops, especially pottery factories, obviously in some functional relationship to the still existing temples. After the destruction of the Hittite capital the area of the "Oberstadt" was left unsettled until Byzantine times. In this period (Oberstadt 1) the area was reoccupied by scattered buildings, among them the well preserved ruin of a mansion, arranged around an inner courtyard and including living rooms, store- rooms, stables and a small chapel. At Yerkapi excavation was concerned with the eastern part of the southern glacis and the east staircase. Restoration work was mainly concentrated here on the parts unearthed during former seasons, i.e. on the city wall on top of the artificial mound and on the pavement in the western part of the slope. CAFER HOYUK, 1982' The area excavated, which in 1980 amounted to 110 sq. m., was extended in 1982 to 210 sq. m. It comprises two trenches, one in the western part of the h6yfik, the other in the east. Although the upper Neolithic is everywhere at the surface, it is interrupted at many points, on the one hand by pits containing pottery dug in the Early Bronze III, and on the other by a medieval cemetery. In clearing the later tombs and pits great care was taken not to damage the remains of walls and the neo- lithic levels lying beneath them. Thirty tombs were dug this year. As in 1980, these are oblong pits oriented east-west; the skeleton is laid out on its back, the head to the west. About ten of the tombs produced jewellery (bracelets of bronze, iron and frit, bronze rings, necklaces of stone or glass beads); others also contained an oil lamp, buried either beside or beneath the body. To judge from the type of lamp, these tombs dated from the 12th century A.D. The Neolithic Village In the western trench, where Building 3 and parts of 2 and 4 were excavated in 1980, two others (5 and 6) and the rest of house 2 have been cleared in 1982. These buildings are of two types. Buildings 3, 4 and 6 have a multicellular plan with small rooms; buildings 2 and 5 consist of a single rectangular room without internal divisions and with a floor of pebbles. All have the same orienta- tion and are either contiguous or separated by a narrow passage. The multi- cellular building 6 is slightly earlier than 2 and 5, which are unicellular, but build- ings 3 and 4 were evidently contemporary with building 2. In the eastern trench a second level of occupation was excavated beneath the pebble floor and the brick walls cleared in 1980. Outside one of the multicellular houses was a cooking area with two trench-hearths and a large quantity of animal bones. The hearths are of the type called "Polynesian", filled with pebbles split by the fire and cinders. They were certainly for the purpose of cooking meat, outside the covered habitations. 1 Translated and condensed from a report kindly provided by J. Cauvin and 0. Aurenche. 238</page><page sequence="9">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY The two trenches yielded quantities of tools, both in obsidian (of very mixed origin) and more rarely of flint: arrow-heads, sickle-blades, scrapers, burins, etc. There are a few polished axes of basalt or green rock, and querns for grinding the grain. The most important result of the campaign was the discovery of a deposit of bracelets of polished stone (basalt or marble) of a high aesthetic quality. Study of the animal bones found in 1980 showed that the fauna consumed was wild: mainly goat, ox and boar, with a little sheep, deer and roe. There was still no real animal husbandry at Cafer Hoyiik. A statistical study of the age classes should reveal the method of acquisition. Agriculture is probable, from the nature of the tools. Laboratory analysis of the abundant plant remains found this year should confirm this. Conclusion The preceramic neolithic village of Cafer Hoyiuk, built at the beginning of the 7th millennium B.C., presents a dense architectural tissue of closely packed houses. This distinguishes it from the village of the same epoch at Cayoniu (Diyarbekir), where the habitations were more widely spaced. The two types already recognized by Braidwood at Cay6nii ("cell-plan" and "large-room plan") were there considered to be successive in time. At Cafer Hoyik they seem to have existed simultaneously. One supposes a difference of function between the two types rather than two successive cultural phases. The discovery of trench-hearths with pebbles, new in Turkey, but already known in Syria on the Middle Euphrates at Mureybet, confirms the southern origin of this first Neolithic on the Upper Euphrates. Cafer Hoyuik reveals an upland version of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B of the Levant, a version distin- guished, like Cayoniu, by certain cultural traits, such as bracelets of polished stone, the distribution of which seems to be limited to the Taurus and the Zagros. Cafer H6yiik seems to represent the very beginnings of "subsistence pro- duction" in Turkey, and, with Cayiniu, its most ancient village. DIDYMA, 19821 Operations lasted from 1 August to 30 September 1982 and had the fol- lowing objectives: (1) continuation of the surface excavations and soundings in the area of the Sacred Way; (2) work on the finds; (3) recording of the ancient architectural graffiti in the temple of Apollo; (4) conservation and restoration. 1. In continuation of the excavations in the area of the Sacred Way, the area west of the rock outcrop as far west as the trenches 1, 2 and 3 of 1981 and the tractor road bounding the field on the south was uncovered. It was only in the northern part that some remains of buildings were found, together with the lower part of a lime kiln made of spoils. The area north of the "bath passage" was laid bare to a length of 38 m. between the Sacred Way in the east, the baths in the west and the boundary of the field in the north. This area was occupied by a structure of imperial date consisting of courtyards and rather large rooms; to the north this was bounded by an alley and had been much altered in Byzantine times. Among other soundings devoted to special problems, that concerned with the Sacred Way brought the following results: floors and remains of buildings alongside the road belong to three distinct layouts, of Trajanic, Hellenistic and Late Archaic periods, the width and direction of which were 1Translated and condensed from a report kindly provided by Professor K. Tuchelt. 239</page><page sequence="10">ANATOLIAN STUDIES frequently changed. Important for the question of the extent of ancient Didyma is the discovery of a boundary stone found in situ on the eastern periphery, which had been covered over when the Hellenistic road was constructed. 2. Work on the finds was mainly devoted to the pottery from the campaigns of 1980/81 and the animal bones from those of 1969-82. Progress was made especially with the "Investigations of the typology and chronology of the Hel- lenistic and Roman plain ware of Didyma" by U. Wintermeyer, and in connexion with it, archaeological investigations (neutron-analysis) of ceramic samples and local clay deposits, which resulted in reliable criteria for distinguishing local from imported wares. The preliminary conclusion is that the material of the greater part of the Didyma pottery comes from local clay beds in the vicinity. The examination of the bones led to the conclusion that these were not the normal kitchen refuse found in house-settlements. The extraordinary preponder- ance of ox-bones can be explained by the special importance of oxen in sacrifice. Most of the oxen identified were apparently magnificent animals, whose slender form has virtually no parallel among the prehistoric and early historic oxen of Europe and Asia. 3. The recording of the ancient architectural graffiti discovered by L. Hasel- berger in 1979 was continued by him. In the meantime they had been found not only in the adyton of the temple, where they run round the socles of the walls almost without a break, but also in the Hall of Two Pillars and in the Dode- castylos, as well as for the ground plan in the substructure of the temple which is laid out at natural size. Altogether the outline plans occupy about 100 m. of continuous wall space, i.e. assuming a height of about 2 m. and sometimes more for the drawings, an area of about 200 sq. m. According to the present state of knowledge, nothing contradicts the assumption that in pre-Roman times the temple was built to a unified plan, derived from the temple of Athena at Priene and the Ephesian Artemision. The Naiskos and the still standing, incomplete columns of the southern ring-portico were also investigated. The most important new discovery among the drawings concerns the Naiskos. On the western front of the adyton there is a 12-metre drawing showing the pediment and entablature of the Naiskos. The height and the extension of the building, however, remained unchanged. The location of this outline of the Naiskos provides a terminus post quem for the completion of the socles of the adyton, viz. the middle of the 3rd century B.C. Since in the building reports of the years following 200 B.C., which are fully preserved, there is no mention of work on the Naiskos, the Naiskos must at that time have already been erected. Its date of construction thus falls into the third quarter of the 3rd century B.C. 4. Measures of conservation were carried out in the area of excavation inside and outside the Temple of Apollo. In the course of clearance about 150 mostly undamaged limestone blocks of the Naiskos were found, which had been re-used in early Byzantine times in the building of the Adyton-basilica, also tiles, coping- stones, tori, capitals, etc. from the Naiskos. The examination of this material shows that the plan and elevation of the Naiskos must be reconsidered. It is not so much a question of its general appearance, rather its dimensions and pro- portions will have to be recalculated. In the adyton about 60 blocks were re- arranged and fragments of marble stroleres and roof-tiles from the archaic period were stored in the depot. The great threshold of the door in the Dodecastylos and parts of the walls of the adyton were roped off as a protection against damage by tourists. Finally a cast was made of the well-known late Classical lion and was erected in its original attitude on a base below the approach to the temple area. 240</page><page sequence="11">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY ENEZ (THRACE), 19821 The 1982 excavations at Enez were carried out at the following locations: (1) The cellar of the fortress; (2) Area 2; (3) Area 3; (4) Area 4; (5) Behind the Municipality Building; (6) In the garden of Mustafa Muhittin Merig. 1. Amphoras, stamped amphora handles of Tasos origin, fine terracotta statuettes, kantharos fragments and a large quantity of other pottery were found in the cellar of the fortress. 2. The north-western part of Area 2 was excavated to the calcareous mio- cene formation of the bedrock. Excavations were discontinued because no pottery was found below a depth of 5-40 m. 3. Area 3 was also excavated to bedrock. It is interesting to note that a number of black painted pottery fragments and a dark greyish sherd of bad quality came up at that level. 4. This year excavations were extended to the north-east of Area 3. This large area, which measured 16 m. by 14 m., was designated as Area 4 and further divided into sections a and b. 4a was surrounded by a fairly well preserved Ottoman wall and produced Ottoman-Byzantine pottery, various metal objects and architectural features. 4b, a large area adjoining area 4a, also produced Ottoman-Byzantine pottery under a thick layer of rubble. Below a depth of 3 m. pottery became more frequent. The black polished pottery with beautiful motifs encountered at a depth of 4-50-4-00 m. included fine examples of clas- sical and archaic Greek pottery. Some of the designs with figures were especially interesting. Some grey and dark grey pottery found at the lowest level was handmade. The fact that these finds belong to the lowest level merits special attention in relation to the grey pottery of ancient Thrace. 5. Two soundings were made in the area at the back of the Municipality Building. In both of these, bedrock was reached at a depth of 1-5 m. Pottery fragments with maenad and satyr figures were found in one of the soundings and a terracotta female head in the other. 6. At the request of Mustafa Muhittin Merig, a sounding was made in his garden. Here a mosaic floor was found below a 1-5 m. layer of top soil and rubble. It was discovered that the mosaic, composed of medium-sized coloured stones, covered a large area. A marble capital with an eagle in relief was found at 0-80 m. in the southern corner of the sounding. The capital as well as the size of the mosaic floor point to the presence of an important Late Roman or Early Byzantine settlement. EPHESUS, 19822 In the 88th year of the Austrian research commitment at Ephesus, in spite of some financial difficulties, work was continued on a scale commensurate with that of recent years. Between May and October 1982 19 projects were pursued, which again involved a considerable outlay in personnel and materials. The staff of 54 members worked a total of about 3000 man-days, and there were about 100 workmen, somewhat fewer than in recent years. On the Agora the search for pre-Lysimachean Ephesus was continued, and some new buildings were opened up, showing that the grid plan already existed before Lysimachus.

In the Stoa of the Alytarchs by Curetes Street the last touches were put to the re-laying of the mosaic floor. In the area of the altar at the Artemision, to the north-west an archaic roadway paved with slabs was identified, leading underneath the temple of Croesus and therefore older than it. In the so-called Auditorium in front of the Celsus Library the investigation of the various build- ings resulted in the distinguishing of a number of periods from the middle of the 7th century to about A.D. 700. The restoration of the monumental ivory frieze, presumably part of a piece of furniture, was finally completed. The precious high relief is now exhibited in a glass case at Selguk Museum. In order to make the epigraphic results more easily intelligible to the public, a museum of inscriptions was set up in one of the cryptoporticos by the Domitian Street, containing for the present 57 inscriptions with explanatory notes. In the excavated area to the south above the harbour soundings were carried out, revealing here too extensive buildings of the imperial age. The hoped-for end to the excavations at the House on the Slope was not reached. For here, to the north of unit 7 there is a complex of several rooms of the 2nd century AD. reaching down a further 9 m., and on account of the earth- quake damage which was specially severe at this point and affected particularly the remarkable frescoes, the floor could only be reached at two points. During the clearance of a vault in unit 6 there appeared out of the debris two imperial portraits, that of Marcus Aurelius being one of the best of its kind. Conservation and restoration of the frescoes found in previous years also continued, and in consequence of the repairs to damaged spots the large mythological painting in the Theatre room of unit 1 can now perhaps be better understood. At the Mag- nesian Gate subsidiary soundings were carried out, mainly to identify the original parts attributable to Lysimachus, and in following the adjoining city wall to the north at one point the foundation of the east front of the East Gymnasium was examined. The find of nearly 1,000 coins, from the 4th century B.C. to the 7th century A.D., constituted a new record. In the East Gymnasium the Basilica built into it in the 5th/6th century was shown to have 2 periods; on the mosaic floor were found bronze crosses with inscriptions on chains 4 m. long which had fallen from the ceiling. At the State Agora a subsidiary examination of the Street of the Graves which passes nearby was carried out, and the deep well in the south-west was cleared out down to a depth of 17-5 m., resulting in the discovery of a splendid set of harness of the Augustan age. The re-erection of the south gate of the agora reached its final stage, attaining almost its original height, while at the same time other cosmetic repairs were carried out. ESKIYAPAR, 19821 With assistance from the General Directorate of Museums and Antiquities and the Ankara Society of Friends of Tourism, Antiquities and Museums, exca- vations of Eskiyapar Hoyik were carried out by Ankara Museum of Anatolian Civilizations between 6-17 July, and between 11 October-6 November 1982. The work was carried out in four different trenches designated A, B, C and D. 1Translated from a report kindly provided by Dr. Raci Temizer. 242</page><page sequence="13">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY Trench A: S/12 in the grid plan of the 1981 excavations was extended to cover S/11 in order to find the continuation of the Imperial Hittite wall running in an east-west direction. The Phrygian floor, a great part of which was excavated during the previous seasons, was re-encountered in the south-western corner of grid plan S/11. A Phrygian wall running north-south rested on this floor. Abut- ting on this wall was the foundation wall of an Imperial Hittite structure built as consecutive rooms. Trench B: The only architectural remains in trench B was a piece of well preserved Hellenistic wall which had no connection to any other structure. This piece of masonry consisted of five courses of large stones bonded with mortar. At the eastern corner of grid plan P/13 Phrygian pottery was found lying broken at the bottom of a pit. At the north-eastern corner of the same area, a small typical Early Bronze Age spouted jug was unearthed in a burnt level. A pithos burial was found in the Early Bronze Age level in grid plan R/12. A bronze bracelet on the arm of the skeleton and a pair of silver earrings were found in this pithos burial which probably belonged to a little girl. Trench C: In grid plan S/8, relief decorated vase fragments were encountered after the removal of the foundation wall belonging to the Imperial Hittite period. The general appearance and execution of these fragments resembled the relief decorated fragments of Bitik and inandlk. These vases which characterize the early Hittite period and show skilful workmanship are made of grey clay with grey slip and decorated with a deer, bull and human figures. However, it was impossible to form a complete reconstruction from the pieces recovered. The aqueduct in grid plan S/5-6 was discovered after the course of the Imperial Hittite fortification wall was removed. The floor of the aqueduct was paved with large stones, its walls were built in "bindirme" technique, and it was covered with stone slabs. Trench C produced a great number of small finds among which were spindle whorls, bronze needles, bone and stone tools. The pottery repertoire included complete plates, kettles, jugs, flasks and a large pithos. Two hammer-shaped terracotta stamp seals, a bronze trapezoidal stone seal with hieroglyphics and a terracotta bulla were found in grid plan T/9. Trench D: The work here consisted of cleaning the grid areas O,P,R/10,11, 12 excavated in 1979. There were bronze needles, spindle whorls, hand mortars and a miniature cup, together with various types of pottery. GORDION, 19821 The 1982 Gordion work was devoted to the study of the excavated material and to the conservation of the furniture and frescoes. Ann Gunter, in her final study of the Bronze Age material, found further confirmation that the Gordion Late Bronze Age pottery is especially close to that of Bogazkoy, a phenomenon that could indicate that Gordion lay within the Hittite Empire. Lynn Roller studied the markings on the Gordion pottery from the Bronze Age on, graffiti that were variously manufacturers' or owners' marks, indications of capacity, and, on imported Greek wares, price inscriptions. There are resem- blances to markings on pottery from Bogazkoy and Midas City. 1 Information kindly provided by Professor Keith DeVries. 243</page><page sequence="14">ANATOLIAN STUDIES Jeanny Vorys Canby examined the Phrygian sculpture. She found that it belongs to essentially three classes: schematic representations of divinities, more anthropomorphic depictions of them, and figures of birds. To judge from distinc- tive types of stone that recur among all three classes, figures of each class may have been together in the same original contexts. Elizabeth Simpson, in her study of the Phrygian furniture, worked out new restorations on paper for several of the fragmentary and previously poorly under- stood pieces and drew attention to a carved stretcher with panels of confronted animals, a piece of which is from Tumulus MM, the great tumulus of about the early 7th century B.C. GRITILLE, 19821 The second season of excavations at Gritille on the west bank of the Euphrates, opposite Lidar H6yuik, was carried out during June, July and August of 1982. During the season we profited from the generous cooperation and assistance of the officials of the Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums, and of the civil and military administrations in Ankara, Adiyaman, and Samsat. In 1981 excavations were carried out in three areas. In 1982 Operations XII, XVI and XVII were intended to investigate further some of the phases of occupation found in 1981 in Operation I, the step-trench on the eastern slope. A second step-trench on the west, Operation VIII, tested the sequence of occu- pational deposits on that side of the mound. The area on the top of the mound that revealed mediaeval structures in 1981 was extended to the south, in Opera- tions IX, X, XI and XXV. The purpose of Operation XXIV, on the northeast slope, was to investigate the possibility of reaching early levels without having to remove the thick later deposits found on the top of the mound. The periods of occupation best represented in the results of the 1981 season were the Early Neolithic (c. 7000-6000 B.C.), the Early Bronze (c. 3000-2000 B.C.), and the mediaeval (c. A.D. 1000-1250). These phases also provided most of our material in 1982, but we found indications of occupation in other periods as well. There may have been a settlement at Gritille in the Iron Age (c. 900-600 B.C.). The mound was certainly occupied to some extent in Hellenistic and Roman times, though as yet we know little about the chronology of the occupa- tion of the settlement. There is almost certainly an early Byzantine settlement beneath the Islamic and Crusader structures. In 1981 Early Neolithic remains were found in the last two days of excava- tion, in the very bottom of Operation I, which by that time had been reduced to a width of only 1-20 m. This year part of Operation I was widened, and Opera- tions XVI and XVII were sunk down to and slightly into the Neolithic deposits. In Operation XXIV, also, we found that Neolithic material lay below a thin layer of later deposits. Our collection of Neolithic artifacts was increased by many flint tools and fragments, a part of a shallow saucer of a white chalky material (the "vaisselle blanche" known from several contemporary sites in Syria), and a clay animal figurine. We have so far no architecture or other im- movable features, but in 1983 we can expect to find clearer evidence of what life was like at Gritille in the 7th millennium B.C. In Operations I, XVI and XVII the levels of the 3rd millennium B.C. - the Early Bronze Age - sit immediately above the remains of the Neolithic settle- Condensed from a report kindly supplied by Professor Richard Ellis. 244</page><page sequence="15">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY ment. It is not yet clear whether this gap represents a real hiatus in the occupa- tion of the site, or whether the third millennium inhabitants dug down into the deposits of intervening phases and destroyed the remains of them. Most of the depth of Operations XVI and XVII - about 7 m. - was dug through Early Bronze material, though in Operation XVI there was also a pit dug during the classical period. Unfortunately the entire 3rd millennium deposit in this area was disturbed by pits, so that although we have a good stratified collection of pottery and other artifacts, there is little coherent architecture. The pottery and other objects are similar to 3rd millennium artifacts from Lidar and Kurban Hoyilk on the other side of the Euphrates, and, beyond that, to material in northern Syria. Among other objects with Syrian connections are an early third millennium cylinder seal with a geometric design, probably derived ultimately from the Jemdet Nasr style of Mesopotamia, and a jar neck over which a cylinder seal had been rolled. Unfortunately only a part of the impression is preserved. The use of cylinder seals to mark pottery was common in Syria and Palestine, though it was almost unknown in Mesopotamia, where this type of seal originated. In 1982 two burials were discovered in the Early Bronze levels. In one a young woman, about 20 years old, had been buried in a small pit covered with stones. No objects were found with her. The other burial was more elaborate; a cist of mud bricks laid on edge was built inside a round pit. More bricks were laid over the burial, but had later collapsed into it. When the bricks and the earth beneath were lifted, the skeletons of an adult man and of a boy or girl 8-10 years old were exposed. The skeletons faced each other, and were well preserved; the only objects with them were a small shell pendant near the man's head, and a beautiful quartz arrowhead on the child's jaw. While the latest deposit that we have attributed to the Bronze Age - a pit excavated in 1981, in Operation I - contained material that may date from the early 2nd millennium B.C., we have so far few recognizable remains from this time, when this area lay between the competing spheres of influence of the Hittites and the Mitannians. From Assyrian sources we know something of the area in which Gritille lies during the Iron Age - that is, the early 1st millennium B.C., from about 850 to 600 B.C. Little is known, however, about the pottery of this period in the Lower Euphrates area, so that it has so far been difficult to identify a phase of that period at Gritille. But in a deep sounding in Operation IX, at a depth of 4-4 m. from the surface, fragments of a large storage jar were found, with an incised design that seems to represent a lightning bolt on a stand- probably the symbol of a storm god. The closest parallels to this design are in northern Syria and Assyria, and date to the period between about 850 and 700 B.C. Only further excavation can tell whether this find actually indicates the presence of an Iron Age settlement at Gritille. It was mentioned above that some remains of Hellenistic and Roman times were found. Hellenistic pottery appeared in a pit sunk into the 3rd millennium deposits of Operation XVI, and in Operation XII as well. The curious round structure that was discovered in Operation I in 1981 was cleared out this year, and proved to have Roman pottery on its lowest floors. It was apparently built inside a pit that had been dug down into 3rd millennium deposits. Its function is still not clear; it may have been a storage silo, though there are traces of what appear to be hearths inside it. On the west side of the mound Operation VIII, a step-trench that it was hoped would reveal the sequence of occupation on that side of the mound 245</page><page sequence="16">ANATOLIAN STUDIES reached a depth of about 5-5 m. below the surface. One of the earliest features discovered in this operation was a wall parallel to the edge of the mound, with a drain running under it. In the drain was a small bronze cross which, when cleaned, proved to have an incised figure of Christ on it, clothed and looking outward at the observer. Informed opinions that have so far been obtained about this cross date it to the 6th or 7th century A.D. This find, together with a coin of Justinian I found in 1981 in a later context, argue for an early Byzantine occupation of the mound. A second and more elaborate bronze cross was found in the same test pit that yielded the jar with the lightning emblem mentioned above, but as yet it has not been possible to date it accurately. Above the wall and drain in Operation VIII are a series of fortification walls running along the west side of the mound. The earliest wall had a foundation of large stones, a mud-brick superstructure, and a fill of gravel behind it. A layer of decayed mud-brick shows that this wall had become ruinous before the next one was built. The second wall shows three or four phases of construction. The plans of the earliest phases are not clear, but the next to the last of the walls was about 2 m. thick, with a tower of 5 m. wide projecting 2-5 m. from its outer face. In the last phase the wall was widened by filling in the spaces between the towers with mud-bricks resting on a stone foundation. The resulting wall was 4-5-5 m. thick. It was in its turn allowed to decay; the last structures in the area are wall foundations that extend over the eroded top of the fortification wall. The area cleared on the top of the mound in 1981 was extended to the south, adding 150 square metres (Operations IX, X and XI) to the 100 previously excavated. Close beneath the surface are stone wall foundations contemporary with the post-fortification walls found in Operation VIII. Within the upper levels several phases of building can be distinguished in any one sector, but the impres- sion that we get from the entire excavated area is one of more or less continuous rebuilding, now in one spot, now in another. Beneath about 2 m. of these con- fusing walls was, in one area, a deposit of soft ashy material, probably thrown out from a nearby kiln or oven. In another place was a well-preserved mud-brick wall. These deposits produced fragments of glazed pottery, and so are probably still mediaeval in date - Byzantine or Islamic. A preliminary analysis of the pottery and coins suggests that the occupation of the settlement ended at about the middle of the 13th century A.D. For the earlier levels we can so far only guess that the fortifications belong to the dis- turbed period of the Turkish and Crusader invasions, about A.D. 1000-1150; that the last, post-fortification phase, dates to the time after the fall of the Frankish County of Edessa, when the area was under more or less unified Islamic control; and that the end of the settlement was due to the raids of the Mongols in about A.D. 1250. In addition to the work on the mound itself, an intensive site survey was carried out in the vicinity of Gritille. A number of sites were found, including a scatter of third millennium sherds only about 100 m. south of the mound, a Roman settlement under a nearby village, and several small mediaeval sites. We hope to be able to do small excavations at some of those sites in 1983. GULPINAR, 19821 This year's excavations of the Temple of Apollo Smintheus at Giulpinar Translated from information kindly supplied by Dr. Coskun O-zgiincl. 246</page><page sequence="17">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY were carried out between 5 July and 1 September 1982 and the work originally intended for previous years was finally completed. One of the fundamental problems of the site, the ground plan of the Temple, had not been solved because of limited time and some legal obstacles faced in the 1980 and 1981 seasons. Finally, authorization to work in the garden of the oil refinery owned by Ali Sengoren was obtained in 1982 and excavations began. In the 5 x 15 m. trenches opened, the foundation walls which were first discovered by R. Pullan in 1866 were re-encountered proving that Pullan's past observations were still valid. It was once again established that the walls of the cella and the bonded walls of the peristyle foundations were made of tuffaceous stone and the temple was built on a grid plan. A floor of rubble stones was observed over the space between these walls. It seems that the architect who built the substructure of the cella was not meticulous and did not find it necessary to arrange the founda- tion stones in any particular order. Another objective of this year's excavations, restoration work, was also begun. One of the badly damaged column bases was first restored with plaster and later a mould was made in order to restore the main shaft. The work was carried out with the help of ceramicists from the Department of Ceramics of the State Faculty of Fine Arts of Mimar Sinan University. The third objective of the excavations was to investigate the Roman remains mentioned by Pullan. In all probability, it was this structure which Pullan re- ported to be at a distance of 15 m. from the long south-east wall of the Temple. This re-appeared in the 5 x 15 m. trenches that were opened for this purpose. From the pottery finds, the structure can be dated to the 2nd century AD. Plaster found on the floor testifies to the use of the building as a cistern, at least in part. IASOS, 19821 The campaign lasted from July 14th to September 6th. Due to an increase of credits it has been possible to resume excavation in several points of the ancient city and to continue at the same time the various activities undertaken in previous years. The most important excavations were: (a) In the Sanctuary of Zeus The works brought to light the back of the small temple, probably built in the Classical Period (5th cent. B.C.) and enlarged to the East in the Hellenistic Period, when also the basement for the statue was enlarged. Under the pavement of this temple a huge quantity of figurines of Archaic and Early Classical types, together with pottery from the Orientalizing and Archaic periods, bear witness of an earlier shrine or cult in the same spot. Among these the rim of a large black- figured column krater had a long inscription in the Carian language. To the West of the temple, a door giving access to the Sanctuary had the two jambs covered with inscriptions containing decrees of the town of lasos which were to be put in "the sanctuary of Zeus and Hera". These inscriptions inform us that, at least from the 4th century B.C. onwards, the goddess Hera was associ- ated in the cult to Zeus. (b) In the Temple of Apollo In the area between the Sanctuary of Artemis Astias and the Agora we had 1 Information kindly supplied by Prof. Clelia Laviosa. 247</page><page sequence="18">ANATOLIAN STUDIES excavated the pronaos of a small temple dipylon "in antis", which was supposed to be the temple of Apollo often mentioned in the inscriptions. This year all the eastern side and the back of the pediment, very well pre- served, were brought to light. We also dug part of the inner room or "cella", down to the foundations, because we found it full of statues or fragments of statues in marble. Best preserved were a colossal male statue and a female one, both probably belonging to the Early Imperial period. (c) In the Roman Agora The South Stoa of the Roman Agora is now completely free and many architectural fragments of the colonnade have been rescued, together with inscrip- tions and other elements. During the excavations, some scanty remains of walls of Late Byzantine date and some, more consistent, of Late Roman-Early Byzan- tine date were identified and drawn in our general plan of the area. (d) In the Stratigraphical Trench in the centre of the Agora In this large trench where we have continued to dig every year since 1967, the excavation in 1982 was devoted to the north-eastern side, where an Early Christian Basilica was used also in later periods as a cemetery. After removing three layers of tombs and part of a wall of the Basilica, we reached the earlier levels: an Hellenistic water channel filled with Late Hellenistic pottery, part of a stone pavement of the archaic period (possibly belonging to the earliest Agora), and the continuation to the north of the large Geometric necropolis, which has yielded until now 99 tombs. In the tombs dug this year there were vases of the usual types, either painted or plain, and some fragments of bronzes. Immediately under the necropolis we reached the Late Bronze and Middle Bronze Age levels, which consist of habitation. Within the latter, a long E/W wall, related to a floor containing conical cups of the Minoan type and fragments of vases (still under restoration), provided us with another proof of the extension in this direction of the Minoan settlement. Restorations Our effort this year was devoted particularly to the mosaics, especially in the Roman "Villa dei Mosaici" and "Propileo Sud", in view of the preparation of the course, which will be held next year, for young Turkish restorers. Topographical Survey and Publications Due to the delay in obtaining the "Ikamet Tezkeresi" for some members, only part of the programme of topographical survey and preparation of maps could be carried out. On the contrary, work was regularly continued for the preparation of the publication of the Orientalizing pottery and the other subjects in progress. IKIZTEPE, 19821 A ninth season of systematic excavations sponsored by the Turkish Histori- cal Association, University of Istanbul and Ministry of Culture was carried out at Ikiztepe in June and July 1982. The season's work was aimed at trying to un- earth the rest of the graves of the extra-mural cemetery located at Mound I. 22 new skeletons, again buried in simple earth graves some with gifts, were found in various depths in gridsquares D-2/IV-10, D-1/IV-10, C-20/IV-10, C-19/ 1 Report kindly supplied by Associate I'rofessor Dr. Onder Bilgi of Istanbul University. 248</page><page sequence="19">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY IV-10 in Trench "D". These graves dating again from the early Bronze Age III yielded this year bronze objects such as pins, bracelets, earrings and a type of bowl peculiar only to burials. During the excavations to find the burials in these gridsquares were collected whole pots and pottery fragments dating from the Early Bronze Age II. An interesting object of this layer was a golden, flat ring in the shape of a highly stylized idol. Another sounding was also carried out in trench "D" but in grid squares D-l/IV-12, D-2/IV-12 and D-2/IV-13 this season to locate the limit of the grave- yard. However, the depth of this sounding did not reach the level of burials. The pottery fragments collected from four different building levels have shown that the layer with graves here is also covered with the "Transitional Layer" which is contemporary with Kiiltepe-Karum building levels IV to Ib, Bogazkoy Biiyiikkale IVd, Lower City 4 and Western Slope 9 and 8 and Alisar H6yiik building level 10T. There are two interesting finds from this layer: the first one is a small flat axe of bronze, and the second is a broken stone mould used to produce shaft-hole axes. Next year's excavations have been planned in this area, first to find out the other burials of the graveyard, secondly to investigate the characteristics of the layer in which the Early Bronze Age III skeletons are buried. IMIKUSA GI, 19821 Imikusagl Hoyiik is situated on the north-western edge of Imikusagl village of Baskul Ilqe, in Elazig II. It stands 38 m. above the present riverbed on the banks of the Euphrates. It stands on conglomerate rock and is heavily eroded on its north and south slopes. Together with its terraces it measures a little over 150 m. from north to south and about 200 m. from east to west. The cone of the mound itself is about 110 m. high and 100 m. in circumference. Carried out entirely by students, the main purpose of the excavations in 1982 was to make a quick but thorough study of the Medieval, Hellenistic and Late Iron age levels at the top of the mound and to establish the general strati- graphy of the site. The Medieval settlement was represented by three building levels, mainly at the north of the mound. An anonymous bronze Byzantine coin found in situ in the third level enabled us to date the buildings to the middle of the 11 th century. There is a seated figure of Christ on one side of the coin and a jewelled cross on the other with IC XC N NI KA legible between the arms of the cross. Hellenistic and Late Iron age buildings were unearthed in the middle of the mound. These structures, of which only three areas surrounded by 1-40 m. thick mudbrick walls are preserved, seem to have been used for a long period. With the exception of two black polished sherds, the pottery found here was the thick red polished Hellenistic type similar to the Pergamene group commonly found in other Central Anatolian sites such as Kululu, Yassldag and Topakll. The Hellenistic and Late Iron age buildings were found on a thick burnt layer. The pottery that came below this layer with typical sharply incurving shoulders and grooved neck and with fine straw tempered paste, belong to the Middle or, less probably, to the Early Iron age. To study the stratigraphy of the mound a number of trenches were opened on a single axis on the southern slope. A 2 m. thick stone fortification wall was Translated from a report kindly provided by Dr. Veli Sevin. 249</page><page sequence="20">ANATOLIAN STUDIES unearthed in the first of these trenches. Built over structures from the Hittite Empire period, the fortification wall extended in a south east/north west direc- tion towards the top of the mound. Under the fortification walls were found the building levels which we believe to be contemporary with Norsuntepe III and Korucutepe J levels. Two storage rooms with 3.00-3-50 m. thick mudbrick walls were found in the other two trenches. These storage rooms, which we believe are contemporary with the later period of the Assyrian Trading Colonies, were destroyed by fire. A large number of terracotta bull figurines, a figurine of a North Syrian type goddess and a sherd with the "signe royal" motif, characteristic of Kiultepe level IB, were found in these storage rooms which as yet have not been completely excavated. As far as can be gathered from the results of the excavations in 1982, Imikusagl Hoyiuk had its most brilliant period in the 2nd millennium B.C.; in the first half of the 1st millennium B.C. it became an important stronghold with a 2 m. thick fortification wall. IZNIK THEATRE, 19821 The theatre, reputed to have been built by the Emperor Trajan (97-117), is situated on the south-east side of Nicea (Iznik) on the shore of the Iznik Lake (Askania Limne), 86 km. north-east of Bursa. The site is 400 m. from the lake and 100 m. from the walls of the city. It stands 98 m. above sea level and is located within an area of 7,332 m.2 of Government property. In 1982, the third season of excavation at the Iznik Roman theatre, work was concentrated in the north-east and south-west, around barrel vault VII and on the substructure of trapezoidal vault IV. During the past 2 years, the diazoma has been unearthed. This consists of the foundations of 14 step seats and two barrel vaulted tunnels, one wider than the other, leading to the orchestra and the skene. The doorway leading to the trapezoidal vault V was found in a 2 x 2 m. trench opened to the south of vault IV. The skeletons found inside this area emphasize the fact that it was used as a burial ground at some period. In trench 15, a 1 m. thick deposit contained unglazed, unpainted coarsely made sherds, human bones, fragments of tiles, horns and hooves of small animals. Below this deposit there followed a concentration of pottery sherds made from white or pink clay and painted in light green, lemon yellow, dirty yellow and dark green. Glazed 7th-10th century Byzantine ware of Istanbul origin, decorated with crosses, open-winged eagles, human and animal figures in relief, was also found. The burnt strata with layers of human bones and ash deposits observed in trench 11, also occurred in trench 15. A large number of human bodies had been burned and the ashes swept from the lower cavea to the orchestra. The top layer of trench 17 is similar to that of trench 15. Two child skele- tons were found buried close together at a depth of 0-4 m. under which at 1 50 m. was Byzantine pottery of Istanbul origin. Fragments of marble cups occurred at a level of 3'5 m. followed at 4 m. by 4 more seat foundations of the lower cavea bringing the total number of seats to 17.

The inscription describing this event can be found on the walls to the east of the Istanbul Gate. The stones used in building the theatre were taken from the Deliktas quarry, 4 km. north-east of Iznik. The white stones, however, were quarried at Imikli, 9 km. north-west of Iznik. After the necessary quantity of stones had been cut to size, the resulting chips mixed with sand and limestone were used as mortar and filling material in the foundation of the steps. At the end of the foundation of the 17th step, there began a narrow corridor about 0-80 m. in width which surrounded the orchestra. This corridor had initially been encountered in trench 4 in 1981. 2-70 m. of this corridor has now been unearthed to a depth of 1 m. and it is expected that the floor will be paved with thick square bricks as was the case in trench 4. Trench 18 (2-5 x 3 m.) was opened on an east-west axis inside barrel vault VIII, south of vault IV. In the south-east, a wall fragment (1-27 x 1-30 m.) was revealed; this wall was made of rubble covered with yellow clay and paved on top with brick. Rubble, with traces of mortar, found under the brick floor, had fallen from the theatre. The level below produced mixed Ottoman-Byzantine kiln remains and pottery. Under this, decomposed human skeletons were found buried in simple tombs of broken rectangular cyclopian stones. Seven horizontal openings on the east and west walls of barrel vault VII were cleared. These holes were arranged symmetrically from bottom to top and varied in size from 0 13 to 0-21 m. Seven wooden beams were stuck into these holes and wooden planks were placed above them reaching up to a window measuring 0-67 x 0-82 x 0-85 m. This contraption was used to pull heavy equip- ment into the vault for storage. Trench 19 (5 x 5 m.) was opened 11 m. to the south of the cavea walls. At a depth of 0-30 m. was found a 0-20 m. thick burnt layer and below it a layer of ash coming from the kiln. These deposits contained large quantities of kiln equipment. In addition to this material thought to have been thrown out from the 17th century pottery workshop discovered in the 1981 excavation, the following wares were also present: early Ottoman (14th century) Miletus ware, 15th- 17th century Damascus ware, Golden Horn, Cintamani and Rhodes ware. Also present was 16th century Iznik pottery with characteristic motifs - red rose, hyacinth, tulip, with dark green stems outlined in black. On the rim of a coffee cup, an inscrip- tion in Arabic script reading "Sahibe Mirka Ali ...." was done in blue paint on a white background. One-handled mugs were decorated with scenes of sail boats against a background of islands and clouds. At a depth of 1-50 m., a late Byzantine layer produced sgrafiatto ware cups decorated with monograms and birds holding snakes in their beaks. At 2-00 m., we unearthed another section of the cemetery encountered in the previous season. The skeletons in this area were oriented north-west-south- east and lay on their backs with hands crossed on the chest. The average height of the skeletons ranged from 1-70 to 1-75 m. The bodies, which had been placed on top of each other, had decayed to form a 3 m. thick deposit of dark brown- black soil. The mixture of orderly laid out burials and other parts of apparently dismembered bodies emphasizes the fact that these collective burials and fires were the results of a fierce battle. 251</page><page sequence="22">ANATOLIAN STUDIES 23 rare bronze coins found under a skull in trench 4 during the 1981 season were minted by Emperor John I Dunas Vatatsez (1222-54). Trench 20, south of trench 19, produced the remains of a small structure with a foundation of Ottoman period rubble. The cemetery encountered in the north corner of this trench remains unexcavated. Trench 21 to the east of Trench 19 was excavated over a 5 x 6 m. area. Among the ashes thrown out from the workshop kiln in trench 19 were found fragments of pottery and tiles with grape bunch, vine leaf and tendril motifs. These represent the transition from the blue and white pottery of 16th century Iznik ware. Below this Ottoman level was a Byzantine deposit which produced sherds of sgrafiatto bowls decorated with birds, palmettes, half-palmettes and monograms. As in trench 19, collective burials were observed again here at a depth of 0-50 m. under barren, dark brown-black soil. Trench 22, to the south-east of the cavea, measured 3 x 3 m. and was exca- vated to a depth of 2-00 m. Byzantine pottery of the 11th-13th centuries was found here. This skilfully made pottery was decorated in sgrafiatto technique. Fragments, generally beige, mustard and brown, were decorated with concentric circles and half-palmette, stylized plant and bird motifs. A bronze fishing hook and dagger handle decorated with small herring-bone patterned circles were found inside a layer composed of enormous quantities of mussel and lobster shells, fish and chicken bones. The theatre of Iznik has gained a special place among Roman theatres in Anatolia with its excellent surviving substructure and unique examples of Iznik pottery and tiles. The cemetery, although still only partly excavated, is a great attraction for the anthropologist. KOSKERBABA HOYUK, 1982' The rescue excavations at K6skerbaba Hoyuk sponsored only by the Middle East Technical University were carried out from September to Mid-October. As planned last year, the work was concentrated mainly on top of the mound where a mud-brick building dating from the last quarter of the 3rd millennium B.C. and partly destroyed stone foundations of a building of the early 1 st millennium B.C. were unearthed. The other building remains of the latter were located in the eastern and southern part of the mound, covering grid squares L-10,11,12,13; M-10,11,12,13,14; N-10,11,12,13,14; 0-11,12,13,14. This large building has a saloon measuring about 75 m.2, which contained intact pots such as jugs with trefoil mouths, flasks, bowls with three feet in the shape of strap handles and a very large jar with two handles and a spout. The mud-brick building of the 3rd millennium B.C. located in grid squares J-11,12 and K-11,12 has walls standing almost 2 m. in height in the southern section. These walls are seen to be clearly plastered and white-washed. In ad- dition the southern one was decorated with painting badly damaged now. Designs are executed in one part in red on light buff surface, and in the other in red on black surface. This building has also a plastered platform along the eastern wall which shows also traces of black painting. Next season the work is planned to resume on this EBA building on the one hand, and on the other to remove the stone foundations of the 1st millennium 1Report kindly supplied by Associate Professor Dr. Onder Bilgi of the University of Istanbul. 252</page><page sequence="23">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY B.C. building to see the characteristics of the EBA III layer in this part of the mound. KURBANHO YUK, 19821 During the summer of 1982, a third season of excavations was carried out at the site of Kurban H6oyuk, in the Lower Euphrates Salvage Project. As before, the excavations were sponsored by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. Since this third season was mainly a study season, a general summary of the three seasons of work can now be outlined. Four main trenches have now been opened, two of which are aimed at a stratigraphic sequence, and two more which are oriented towards horizontal clearance. In addition, four minor probes have also been excavated on the slopes and saddle of the two mounds, in part to determine the extent of the settlement in various periods. Areas A and CO1 A step trench (A) and a deep sounding (C01) have now been excavated to natural soil, and are currently being expanded. These trenches reveal a sequence spanning the late 5th/early 4th millennia to the end of the 3rd millennium B.C. An additional early Medieval level follows the abandonment of the settlement at the end of the Early Bronze Age. In the basal level of C01 on the north mound, a narrow exposure yielded a Chalcolithic assemblage with "peripheral" Ubaid affinities. In the Late Chalco- lithic period, another settlement was founded in the area of the south mound (Area A). This occupation is directly succeeded by several phases with more substantial architecture, and at some point in time, the settlement expanded to include the north mound (C01). The earliest phases of this period contain a variety of straw tempered wares similar to Amuq F. But in the more substantial, later phases that encompass both mounds, there is a significant component con- sisting of a narrow range of Late Uruk-like ceramics. This Late Chalcolithic settlement is followed by an early EBA occupation with numerous phases res- tricted to the north mound. In these phases, one clear diagnostic is a bowl type known as a "cyma recta" bowl in the Amuq (G-H), but now also found at Hayaz, Hassek, Chagar Bazar, and other sites. It is apparent from the 1982 season that a fairly substantial period of aband- onment then followed. The reoccupation of the site may have occurred around the middle of the 3rd millennium, gradually expanding around a core in the area of the north mound to encompass an area of about five hectares. Several metres of deposition indicate that the occupation lasted well into the late 3rd millen- nium B.C. The ceramics of this period closely resemble the wares of northern Syria, with most of the major classes represented. These include plain wares, metallic wares, reserved slip wares, smeared wash decoration, gray burnished wares as well as the tri-lugged cooking pots and painted wares known also from eastern Turkey. At some point, the settlement seems to have contracted, gradually being confined to the south mound. After a stratigraphic break of as yet un- known duration, a small settlement was founded at the end of the 3rd millennium or the beginning of the 2nd millennium. This was followed by a Medieval level. 1 Report kindly contributed by Professor Leon Marfoe. 253</page><page sequence="24">ANATOLIAN STUDIES Areas Cand D Area C on the summit of the north mound provides a broader view of the mid-3rd millennium settlement. Two building periods have been delineated, the principal features of which were a complex of rooms bordered by a pebble path, and courtyards with small unicellular rooms. On the south mound, the final Bronze Age settlement has been cleared over a substantial area. The principal architectural features consist of a complex of over a dozen rooms and courtyards, a small entry way, and a narrow path. The periphery of this complex had however been destroyed by the construction of an open court building complex of the Abbasid period, perhaps dating to between 840 and 960 A.D. An intensive archaeological survey of the local region has also been under- taken. Sites of the Neolithic (6th millennium), Halaf, Ubaid, Late Chalcolithic and EBA periods have been found. Second and first millennium sites are more difficult to distinguish, but there are substantial remains of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. In addition, possibly three phases of Medieval settlement have been isolated. LIDAR HOYUK, 19821 The third campaign at Lidar Hoyik was carried out by the Institute for Prehistory and Early History of the University of Heidelberg from 20 August to 8 November 1982. Excavations were continued on the summit of the acropolis and on the northern slope in order to complete the stratigraphy from the Middle Ages down to the Chalcolithic. On the western terrace and in the necropolis to the east of the village operations were extended. 1. The Roman and Hellenistic levels on the south side of the plateau were opened up over an area of 25 x 19 m. The Imperial-Roman Level IV a-e, com- prising three building levels, was concluded. Under it was a horizon containing some 40-50 pits which greatly disturbed the level below. In one of the pits was the grave of a young Roman woman, set in bricks, accompanied by a bronze arm ring. Level V produced a large complex of buildings, oriented north to south. It consisted of at least 4 rooms, one of which, measuring 12-70 x 4-70 In., served as a magazine. The dating was assured not only by Hellenistic pottery, fragments of terracotta and parts of weapons, but also by a Seleucid silver coin, to the second half of the 3rd to the first half of the 2nd century B.C. 2. On the north-east slope of the mound, beneath the Hellenistic remains, an Iron Age settlement was investigated, with extensive buildings of the 7th century. In Level III parts of a burnt building appeared, with a room 10 m. long and over 4 m. wide. A stairway consisting of large stone blocks leads into the interior of the acropolis. In the southern room many horns of ibex were found under carbonised remains of beams. In front of the south wall stood two pithoi, one of which had scratched on it a hunting scene and the Hittite Hieroglyph for "Great King". Under the burnt debris there were traces of a chariot wheel with 6 spokes, similar to the Assyrian form. A notable find was a limestone model of a recumbent ibex measuring 28-9 cm. in height and 37-3 cm. in length. The pottery which was partly hand-made and straw-tempered, together with the other finds, allows a dating to the 8th century. In earlier campaigns Iron Age 1 Translated and condensed from a report kindly contributed by Professor Harald Hauptmann. 254</page><page sequence="25">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY remains had already been encountered which suggested a fortified settlement of more than local significance. 3. In the step trench, at step 2, beneath the Hellenistic-Roman horizon of pits, the clearance of the Seleucid levels was begun. Iron Age levels were en- countered in the third step. In Level XIII a house plan measuring 5-80 x 3-70 m. was uncovered. It had been earlier divided into two by a partition. Rich finds of pottery, with flat plates, carinated bowls, jugs and pilgrim bottles, suggest a dating to the 8/9 century. The 4th step revealed the front of a large building, under the floor of which were two child burials. With its light buff, partly comb- incised pottery, like that from Tell es-Sweyhat and Tell Mardih, this level repre- sents the early Middle Bronze Age. The level below this belongs to the Early Bronze (IV). In the 4th step the investigation of the oldest Early Bronze period was continued. Two building levels produced two successive one-room houses with round hearth. In the oldest level yet discovered, immediately above the drop at the end of the slope, a 2-m. wide defensive wall was followed over a length of 8 m. It had three rooms abutting it on the inner side. The plain simple ware is typical of the older Early Bronze Age. Dark red paint in rows of filled triangles occurs principally on pedestal cups which are also attested in the oldest level of the potter's quarter and in the oldest graves of the necropolises of Lidar and Titris. Other Early Bronze buildings were examined in an area on the west terrace by the bank of the Euphrates. In addition to the two chamber graves (ED III) unearthed in 1981, in which 25 burials were identified, two further pits obviously belonging to them were opened up, one filled with ashes, the other with broken pots. 4. On the west terrace a chain of 6 soundings was carried out, in order to establish the extent of the Early Bronze settlement. Only medieval and late Roman levels have so far been reached. An extensive potter's quarter of the Early Bronze Age was excavated and produced a series of four large U-shaped ovens oriented from East to West. They were preserved up to 1 m. in height and measured 5-20 m. long and 2-20 m. wide. The domed firing chambers were filled with many vessels and rejects, and remains of unfired pots lay outside. The production of pottery appears to have lasted throughout the Early Bronze Age. In the ovens all types of pottery observed at Lidar, from the simple plain ware to metallic wares, were represented. 5. The excavations at the Early Bronze Age necropolis east of the village were extended over an area of 715 sq. m. There for the first time burials of the Iron Age (7th century B.C.) were encountered. The grave goods included a bone bangle, a stamp seal of crystal, a scarab, and a bronze knee-fibula. 60 further burials of the Early Bronze Age were examined, among them 16 child burials, oriented south-west-north-east. They consisted of stone cists, 0-65-0-90 m. long and 0-45-0-50 m. wide, covered with a stone slab. Accompanying gifts were of up to 3 vessels, only one grave had 11 vessels. Among the 18 well- preserved graves of adults, 16 were in stone cists, up to 1-50 m. long and 0-80 m. wide. To judge from the 15 vessels found in them they belong to the first phase of the Early Bronze Age. Beads and rings of limestone, bronze pins and two stone axes were also found in them. Five graves which were larger than the others, being 2-00 m. long and 2-70 m. wide, consisted, like the chamber graves on the west terrace, of dry walling. In one grave 38 vessels and 5 knob-headed pins came to light. Like the younger graves of Titris, these large stone graves belong to the latest phase of the Early Bronze Age settlement at Lidar H6yuk. Alongside the excavations studies in geomorphology were commenced, in 255</page><page sequence="26">ANATOLIAN STUDIES order to work out a history of the landscape and vegetation of the Euphrates valley at Lidar. MILETUS, 19821 During 1982 at Miletus a first period from May to July was spent in work in the Museum Depot on earlier finds. A campaign of excavations and restorations followed from 27 August to 10 November. The Great Church In continuation of the work carried out in 1972 and 1981 further soundings were made to investigate the underlying buildings, and the previous analysis of the first two phases was largely confirmed: in Phase I, 3/2 century B.C., living quarters in the eastern section, in Phase II, 2/1 century B.C., construction of a complex of porticoes in Doric form with a Doric prostylos(?) in the west next to the Propylon and rooms on the opposite, eastern side. This complex was much altered towards the end of the 1st century AD. (Phase III, with probably a small free-standing temple in the earlier courtyard), but already by the 2nd half of the 2nd century or the beginning of the 3rd it was completely rebuilt (Phase IV, with a large apsidal structure). Probably in the first half of the 6th century there followed the Church (Phase V), against which to the north abutted further rooms (older Bishop's Palace?) which have as yet been only partly cleared. Stratigraphic Soundings on Kalabaktepe Work to the west of the Bouleuterion having been temporarily brought to a close, in order to reach the earlier levels several soundings were carried out on the lower plateau of Kalabaktepe. The buildings already known from earlier diggings were followed further to the west and the different phases could be more clearly distinguished. Prior to the well-known destruction by the Persians in the third quarter of the 6th century there had been another destruction, which can be seen in all soundings, documented by considerable quantities of brick fragments and potsherds. In the debris, beside numerous arrowheads of various types, were found fragments of the heads - less than life size - of two female figures of different sizes, many large vessels (amphorae, deinoi etc.) and an almost complete black-figure lekythos. These new soundings have enriched the repertoire of the archaic pottery of Miletus. Heroon III, by the Faustina-Thermae The drawing of this building, begun in 1981, was continued, and it was established by soundings that the complex - contrary to previous plans - had a system of rooms on its north-east side as well, like that on the south side. This, however, had been largely destroyed by later building in Byzantine and Emirate periods. At the same time the recording of the Heroon by the Theatre harbour (II) was begun. Safety measures In the Bishop's Palace the protective shelter for the mosaics was completed and in Heroon III the surrounding walls were strengthened. All the stone finds were placed in a new depot and arranged systematically on shelves. Translated from a report kindly supplied by Professor W. Miller-Wiener. 256</page><page sequence="27">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY PERGAMON, 19821 The campaign at Pergamon in 1982 consisted of three parts: (1) Restorations at the Trajaneum and archaeological work connected with them, from 1 May to mid October; (2) architectural recording and control soundings at the Asclepieion, from 5 July to 14 August; (3) work by the team of the city excavations in the depot, from beginning of August to mid October. City excavations, work in the depot There were no excavations in the city this year and the team concentrated on the finds already in the depot. Pottery was restored and the Roman wall- paintings from the city excavations were conserved. Conservation was also carried out on the wooden parts of a trough-like bier excavated earlier at a tumulus near Elaia, and these wooden parts were drawn and reconstructed on paper. The torso of the statue of the armoured man found in the Trajaneum in 1981 was cast in cement. A beginning was made with a catalogue of all the architectural elements, classical and Byzantine, lying about on the citadel. Pieces which had already been gathered together provisionally in a room of the library north of the Athena Street were sorted out into categories and placed in another room together with those from the Trajaneum and two inscriptions. Asclepieion A programme of checks, measurements and other controls was begun with a view to the further publication of the architectural remains of the Asclepieion. Preparatory work had previously been carried out by architects H. Hanson and O. Ziegenaus in the years 1928-38. It is necessary to supplement the existing plans with sections and elevations. Sample sections of the building must be recorded in detail, and soundings are needed to clarify points of construction. The walls must be examined for traces of incrustation as a clue to the interior arrangements of the building. In 1982 the following tasks were carried out: A north-south section through the theatre with a view of the north part of the west portico, and a section through the western part of the north portico with a view of the theatre. Capitals, cornices and other parts were recorded, and soundings were carried out in the foundations of the theatre, on the stylobate of the west portico, on the peristasis of the west portico, and on the western exedra. Trajaneum Archaeological activities were, as usual, closely related to the necessary safety measures, partly caused by severe weather conditions. Behind the supporting wall of the north portico earth pressure during the winter had caused part of the wall to move, and some andesite blocks had even fallen into the courtyard. In order to be able to remove the resulting bulge structurally and also to obtain a better dating for the ancient fill behind the portico, the back of the wall was cleared of earth and a trench was cut up the slope at right-angles to the wall and down to the bedrock. No evidence was found for a Hellenistic building date for the portico wall such as had been assumed by the first excavators. On the contrary, all the pottery in the fill was of Roman imperial date. Mortar was found in the lowest levels of the sounding. 1 Condensed from a report kindly provided by Professor W. Radt. 257</page><page sequence="28">ANATOLIAN STUDIES Building work on the north wall of the so-called Red Hall revealed that immediately to the north of this wall there was a channel for draining the water on the slope. At the south end of the east portico the sounding begun last year was finished. Its purpose was to find out whether there was a structural connexion or even a passage-way between the east portico (below floor level) and the Vault L adjoining it on the south. On the bedrock were found remains of a 1 m. wall, oriented as usual diagonally to the Trajaneum. In Roman times the floor level of the east portico was obtained by filling in over the earliest remains. In Byzantine times a pit was dug which presumably served as access to Vault L through an opening in its north wall. A sounding in the northern part of Vault L revealed scanty traces of the diagonally oriented Hellenistic levels and a cutting in the rock for the original east wall of the Trajaneum (later, after enlargement, the west wall of Vault L). There were also signs of re-use of this vault in the middle ages, in two phases, c. 12th/14th century, to judge from the pottery. Another sounding was made in the southern part of the vault. Here in the medieval fill two pairs of overturned Doric capitals of good Hellenistic form were found, one upon the other. Two of them showed on one side of the abacus an extra obtuse angle, making a 5-cornered abacus instead of the usual square, and indicating that the building had been polygonal (octagonal?). No such building has been located. At a lower level were remains of a water tank made of mortar and beside it a floor. These interesting results will require further investigation. Other soundings were carried out on the western side of the Trajaneum. At the Western Annex the object was to clarify the underlying buildings. Buttress B belonging to Wall A was found to go down in steps 2-5 m. to its foundation in the bedrock. The wall and the buttress are Hellenistic but later than the city wall S since wall A abuts on S. The earth fill in WKB 4 was shown by the pottery to be entirely Roman Imperial. Wall S was found to make a sharp bend eastwards for a short stretch, and there were indications that it then turned northward again, which suggests that it followed the slope in a zigzag course. The pottery in WKB 3 was also Roman Imperial. In Vault D and WKB 1 clearances were made with a view to further excavations and rebuilding. Documentation by drawing, architectural studies, replacing of fallen ele- ments and safety measures were undertaken on an extensive scale. PINARBASIHOYUK, 19821 Pmnarbasl Hoyuik is situated 5 km. to the north-west of Bor Ilqe of Nigde Il, on the left side of the Bor-Altinhisar road. The excavations began on 7 July 1982 and continued until 20 July 1982. Archaeologist Erol Faydall and Hit- titologist Hilmi Atabey, from the Archaeological Museum of Nigde and students Can Onen, Tunq Sipahi and Tayfun Aras from the Near Eastern Archaeology department of the Faculty of Languages, History and Geography, took part in the excavations. The work was carried out in three trenches located on the top, the south and the west slopes of the mound. All three trenches bore witness to the fact that the top level of the first millennium settlement (i.e. the Phrygian) was Translated from information kindly contributed by Dr. Ugur Silistreli. 258</page><page sequence="29">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY heavily destroyed by the Islamic burials which were lined with a single layer of mudbrick and covered with stone slabs. Wherever the well-smoothed floor of the first level was preserved, it produced fragments of polychrome pottery finely decorated with yellow on a light background; thick black parallel lines on a light red or pink background; with motifs of triangles and concentric circles; also found were fragments of well polished dark grey monochrome Phrygian pottery. Under the badly damaged Level I, stood the square or rectangular buildings of Level II, erected on stone foundations with mudbrick superstructure. The square building found in the central trench is a fine example of the typical struc- .tures of this level with its foundation of well cut stones. Storage bins, mortars and a tandir were found in situ on the floor of this level. Below this floor was unearthed a pithos burial containing the skeleton of a child and sealed with a cover stone. The pottery found in this level consists of carefully made, fine, well polished black ware and, in a lesser quantity, polished red ware. It is interesting to note that the skilfully made black ware is decorated in relief with stylized figures of animals such as bulls, deer and goat and sometimes with horns and heads of bulls also in relief. Among the types of pottery which are all hand-made, deep and shallow bowls, single handled mugs, vases with flaring rims, pots and double handled jars deserve special mention. This level also contained large quantities of obsidian cutting and boring tools which show a well developed technique and skilful workmanship and weapons such as knives and arrowheads with shafts made of bone or horn. Two obsidian pieces that could be either castanets or lids are of special interest. In our opinion, it is possible that this second level which immediately precedes the Phrygian and which is not damaged by the Islamic burials, could be dated to the neolithic period from its architecture, pottery and small finds. SARDIS, 19821 The 1982 season of the Archaeological Exploration of Sardis, jointly spon- sored by the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University, Cornell University, and the American Schools of Oriental Research, lasted 21/2 months (from mid-June to early September). The staff numbered 24 and included members associated with 10 different universities in the United States and Turkey. Excavation focused on a region northwest of the Acropolis and near the modern highway where there are well-preserved remains of monumental Lydian buildings. Above the Lydian stratum are remains of a Late Roman building complex, of which several rooms and corridors were excavated. Two rooms are of special interest for their good state of preservation and mural decoration: a rectangular chamber with floor and baseboard of tiles, simple wall painting, and two vaulted wall niches lined with slabs of coloured marble; and an apsidal hall (partly exposed in 1980) with wall paintings that imitate opus sectile in multi- coloured veined and brecciated stone. Of the Lydian features in this part of Sardis the most conspicuous is the Colossal Lydian Structure, whose remains (constructed of stone and mud brick; 20 m. broad at the base and standing to a height of 8 m.) create a low hill in the present landscape. Two unanticipated components of this structure were exposed: part of a stone tower or deep "in- 1 Information kindly provided by Professor Crawford H. Greenewalt, Jr. 259</page><page sequence="30">ANATOLIAN STUDIES dented trace"; and a curious narrow wall that runs roughly parallel to the Struc- ture, about 3-4 m. out from its east face. The narrow wall displays a slight but distinct lean away from the Colossal Structure; but it evidently was free-standing (viz., it did not revet an embankment for a ditch, as its form and position suggest). The function of this wall remains to be explained. North and south of the artificial hill, excavation exposed more impressive Lydian architecture. Immediately to the South appeared a short section of masonry, standing 3 m. high and built of large blocks, which may be part of the Colossal Structure. Some 25 m. north of the hill (and across the modern high- way) is a substantial Lydian wall or terrace, partly exposed in earlier seasons, whose exposed contour now has the form of a right-angle "W" and extends over a distance of some 30 m. The face, including sub-surface foundations, stands 4 m. high. Above the foundations it is built of sandstone and limestone, one kind of stone for each "V" of the "W". The masonry blocks are crisply cut and pre- cisely jointed, and their faces display chisel-draughted borders and point-stippled or roughly-hewn centres. Each block is inscribed with one or two "masons' marks." In the eastern region of Sardis, excavation exposed more of two structures discovered in 1981, a massive Lydian terracing or defensive wall and an Early Roman Imperial colonnaded building. The Lydian wall, located at the outer edge of a flat-topped spur of the Acropolis, is 3 5 m. thick and built of large, roughly-jointed stones. It has now been shown to extend in a straight line for some 30 m. and to have an adjunct of stone rubble construction 5 m. broad, perhaps a rough glacis or platform foundation, on the steep hillslope immediately in front. Of the Roman building, just enough of one corner was exposed to show that it had a pseudodipteral prostyle arrangement of columns (which are Ionic, with Attic bases). The columns' arrangement together with their size and fine ornament indicates that the building was a temple. Stylistic features suggest a date in the 1st century AD. A layer of debris from the building included small fragments of marble sculpture, an unfinished pediment block carved in relief with a seated figure labelled ADRAMYTEON (a city associated with Lydia in historical tradition), and thirty fragments of cast bronze, some of them sculptural (lion's paw; lion's mane?), some gilded. The clearing and excavation of a ruined tumulus burial on the west side of the Pactolus stream provided additonal data on tumulus chamber design and construction and on utilization of rock outcropping in the core of the tumulus mound. Miscellaneous discoveries included two Greek inscriptions on stone. The first, a boundary stele of the Sanctuary of Artemis, with 76 lines of text, estab- lishes that the Artemis worshipped in Sardis's huge temple was Artemis Sardiane (not Ephesia, as some have supposed) and records that the boundary delimited by the stele was confirmed by Julius Caesar when he was consul for the fifth time and dictator for life, i.e., between mid-February and mid-March, 44 B.C. The second inscription, a statue base that honours a prominent citizen of the 3rd century AD., is of particular interest for the genealogical information it provides about the citizen's family: names and some titles of members spanning five generations are given. Several of these members are women, and several of the male members are otherwise known from numismatic and epigraphical sources. In addition the inscription makes reference to what may be a topographical feature of Sardis (en tois tessarsin makellois) and to a visit to Sardis, otherwise unattested, by Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. 260</page><page sequence="31">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY SEHREMUZ (SAMSA ), 19821 During altogether 4 months in May/July and September/November 1982 the Institut fiir Urgeschichte of the Universitat Ttibingen in cooperation with the Chair for Prehistory of the Dil ve Tarih-Cografya Fakiiltesi of Ankara University conducted excavations in the Palaeolithic Site of Sehremuz with a team up to 19 plus some local workers. The excavation was concentrated in three different areas (A-5, A-6 and A-10). In A-6 it was established that both gravels and artifacts are in secondary position in the form of a postpleistocene colluvium. In A-5 and A-10 the artifacts are bedded in a creek gravel formed by local limestone, flint, sand, silt and clay. Those gravels are formed under similar conditions as in the actual Kelusk creek running deeper in the valley to-day. The vegetation in the time of the formation of the older gravels should be open grassland on the more stabilized slopes with some trees and brushwood as well, but not denser forest. The lime- stone gravels can be correlated with the highest Euphrates gravels in the Samsat basin, forming the oldest part of a full sequence after a larger erosion interval. Very likely the whole sequence must be dated into the Upper Pleistocene and Holocene. Partially even the erosional channels at the base of the gravel could be recorded giving a good impression of the dynamics of the formation quite typical for sidevalley deposits. They are formed by seasonal floods and represent short time events. The artifacts found are partially still in place and partially trans- ported over longer distances. Some of the artifacts evidently form activity clusters in different horizons. Larger camp sites were not observed, but a part of the material could belong to such sites being washed out by the creek during times of higher flood. Most of the material seems to belong to hunting activities in the valley bottom close to the creek or even in it. That in such cases rather small inventories of artifacts have to be connected with considerable numbers of hunted and butchered animals can be seen in sites with well preserved food- bone remains, which are not present in $ehremuz and the gravel formations there. This correlation is found for example in Lehringen in a similar age as our site or later in the Palaeoindian Olsen-Chubbuck site. The artifact inventories are to be dated into a relatively narrow time range in the older and already cooler Upper Pleistocene. The basic production is done by flaking from prepared cores of different shape, even some with rather ad- vanced blade negatives. The handaxes found belong into a later level of the Acheulean. They cover with 250 specimens a large range of shapes as well as the other modified tools. The function of the tools will be determined by micro- trace analysis so far as possible. Some results are available already and illustrate cutting procedures, but may also be due to changes during rebedding in the sediment. XANTHOS-LETOON, 19822 No excavations took place either at Xanthos or at the Letoon in 1982. A small team spent three weeks at the site and carried out some cleaning up and some recording. In particular all faces of the inscribed bases in honour of the athlete Titus Flavius Hermogenes were cleared and recorded; only the front had 1 Information kindly contributed by Professor Hansjiirgen Muller-Beck. 2 Translated from information kindly contributed by M. Christian Le Roy. 261</page><page sequence="32">ANATOLIAN STUDIES been discovered in 1981. The chronology of the different elements constituting the "sacred way" leading to the temples was verified: construction of the paved road in the 2nd century B.C.; erection of the Hermogenes bases in the 1 st century A.D.; placing of a new stylobate at the entrance to the road in the 2nd century AD.; replacement of the columns at the entrance by brick pillars in the 3rd century A.D. Surface reconnaissance in the vicinity of the village of Karakoy, between Xanthos and the Letoon, revealed traces of a Byzantine occupation on the bank of the river, not far from a necropolis which has been known since the 18th century. In the Antalya Museum fragments of sculpture found in 1981 were studied. Several statues previously partly reconstructed were completed, in particular a sixth colossal statue of a draped masculine figure. An account of the colossal statues of the Letoon is now to be read in J. Marcade, "Les statues recomposees du Letoon de Xanthos", CRAI 1980 (1981), 737-59, and idem, "Recomposition de cinq statues hellenistiques du Letoon de Xanthos", RArch. 1982, 175-8. YASSIADA, 19821 The Institute of Nautical Archaeology and the Bodrum Museum of Under- water Archaeology returned to Yassi Ada, near Bodrum, for the first time since 1974 when work was stopped by the outbreak of hostilities on Cyprus. There were a number of reasons for the return. Better conservation techniques than those common in 1961-4 reveal seed contents and graffiti which were over- looked in our original examinations of amphoras from the 7th-century Byzantine shipwreck excavated nearly two decades ago. As many of the amphoras were left on the seabed near the wreck site, part of the 1982 campaign was devoted to raising these for study. We also continued a search for artifacts downslope of the late 4th-century wreck nearby, which was almost completely excavated in 1967 and 1969, and whose excavation we had hoped to complete in 1974. Most of our effort in the summer of 1982, however, was devoted to the excavation of a 16th-century wreck lying between these two earlier, Byzantine ships. This last wreck had been discovered by accident in 1967, because it partially overlies the 4th-century wreck; it was partly uncovered at that time. The hull remains were mapped in 1982 under the supervision of Texas A&amp;M graduate student Cemal Pulak, who now is studying the raised wood fragments in the Bodrum Museum. The wreck, dated by a silver coin of Philip II of Spain, remains a puzzle, for neither cargo nor ballast was in evidence. A series of glazed bowls with pedestal bases remains unidentified. Yassi Ada and the Bodrum Museum also served as the locations for a two- week summer field school in underwater archaeology organized by the Council of Europe and hosted by the Turkish government. Many of Europe's most experienced nautical archaeologists dived on the 16th-century wreck and ex- changed ideas with the Yassi Ada excavation staff. Throughout the year the conservation of wood, glass, ceramics and iron continues under a sizeable staff in the Bodrum Museum. An ongoing survey for ancient ships conducted by the Institute of Nautical Archaeology and the Bodrum Museum located a number of new sites, with the guidance of sponge-divers, including a Bronze Age shipwreck near Kas with a 1Information kindly supplied by Professor George F.

Lastly, Yassi Ada I: A Seventh-Century Byzantine Shipwreck by G. F. Bass and F. H. van Doorninck appeared in 1982 as the first volume in a Nautical Archaeology Monograph Series instituted by the Texas A&amp;M University Press. ANEMURIUM, 19821 A limited five-week season of study and excavation was conducted under J. Russell's direction at Anemurium (Eski Anamur) during June and July 1982. Several projects from previous seasons were completed and much progress was made in preparing material for publication. The major operation was the partial exploration of the early Christian church labelled III 13 C in the city-plan. Three other churches had been pre- viously excavated, and it was hoped that information about this large building would further enhance our understanding of Christian Anemurium. Erected towards the mid-fifth century, the church shares the same general features as the other churches on the site, a wide narthex to the west, giving entrance to a central nave separated by an arcade and side aisles separated from each other by a colonnaded arcade that may be restored with seven evenly-spaced columns. Much of the building's masonry remains strewn in the collapsed debris so that it is possible to reconstruct many of the original furnishings. In the apsidal sanctuary at the east end of the nave, for example, excavations exposed the stepped foundations of the synthronon and the bishop's seat, cuttings for the altar, and the base and fragments of the chancel screen. Opening through doors at the east end of the aisles lie pastophoria, but time permitted only the exploration of that on the south. This proved to be a bap- tistery with cruciform basin near the centre adorned by a vaulted canopy sup- ported by four columns at the corners. Numerous fragments of glass tesserae found in and around the baptistery attest to the rich decoration that once embel- lished the inner face of the canopy. With the exception of the narthex, the building seems to have been paved throughout in mosaic. The designs are geometric, resembling those found in other churches of the city, and vary greatly in complexity. Of special note is a cable motif of oval and circular frames, each containing an animal or bird, that seems to have formed the outer border of the mosaic in the nave, otherwise lost. The most striking discovery appeared in a large grave found resting on the mosaic floor at the southeast corner of the south aisle. It contained at least six skeletons buried at two different times. A variety of objects accompanied the bodies, but the most important was a homogeneous collection of gold jewellery associated with one of the lower burials, perhaps the earliest occupant. A total of 35 pieces of worked gold was found, including ten crosses decorated in open- work spirals, seven plaques in a punched design of dolphins and bunches of grapes, earrings and beads. Also of interest were fragments of fabric woven from gold thread, perhaps the remains of a small purse. Except for the addition of the grave, the church betrays no evidence of subsequent modifications until its destruction towards the end of the sixth century, when it seems to have shared in the general destruction that afflicted the city about that date, probably as the result of an earthquake. There is no evidence of subsequent reoccupation. 1 Information kindly contributed by Professor James Russell. 263</page><page sequence="34">264 ANATOLIAN STUDIES Other work accomplished in 1982 was the clearing of the south aisle of the seaside church (II 16) with a well-preserved floor of interlocking cables and ellipses virtually identical to that of the south aisle of the newly excavated church. Further sondages in the baths II 7 A confirm that, contrary to earlier opinions, the building was constructed as a single unit, with a terminus post quem around 200 A.C. Also of interest is the work on the odeon (II 9 D), where a seg- mental dome of cut masonry at the southwest corner of the cryptoporticus was restored (see AJA 87 [1983], 226-7). During the 1982 season excellent pro- gress was made on preparing the pottery of this and previous seasons for publica- tion and the cataloguing of over 100 architectural fragments, for the most part of no known context, found in the vicinity of Anemurium, was completed. Finally, a report on the condition of the more important mosaics was prepared. This will form the basis for the work of conservation and consolidation that will absorb our attention in future seasons, now that excavation is virtually completed.</page></plain_text>
