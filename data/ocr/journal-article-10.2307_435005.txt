<plain_text><page sequence="1">La Mettrie's "L'Homme Machine": A Study in the Origins of an Idea. Critical Edition with an Introductory Monograph and Notes. By ARAM VARTANIAN. Princeton, N.J.: Prince- ton University Press, 1960. Pp. 264. A notable gap in the shelf of adequate editions of "philosophe" texts has at last been admirably filled, and every eighteenth-century scholar can rejoice. One of the most famous-- or infamous-books of its day, L'Homme Ma- chine was quoted and attacked more often than studied, a title everyone knew, although its exact implications and intentions were de- cidedly not understood. Of recent years copies of the book have not been available, but this excellent edition, with its full and thoughtful apparatus, should surely be well received, and one hopes it will remain in print for years to come. It has every qualification for contin- ued usefulness in eighteenth-century seminars in literature, in the history of ideas, and the history of science. Unhappily, the price of this handsome volume is three or four times what a paperback of comparably high intellectual quality and interest would command. Professor Vartanian is probably the scholar best qualified to undertake this work. His earlier publications, including Diderot and Des- cartes (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1953), on the naturalist philosophy of the Enlightenment, offer solid guarantees that he knows his way around this field as few others do. His elaborate introduction does not disappoint us; it is full and thoughtful, covering all the necessary points, and re-creat- ing the milieu of ideas and influences in which this controversial text was written. The editing is critical, and the few variants discovered are occasionally interesting. The notes, placed together on pages 199-249, exceed in volume the text itself and make interesting consecutive reading, tracing the background of allusions and the history of the ideas which fill the book, from antiquity to modern developments. A selective but well-chosen bibliography and an index complete the volume. The bibliog- raphy has special value, listing the editions of L'Homme Machine, the eighteenth-century translations, numerous items important in the controversy to which the book gave rise, and general works of value in the interpretation and the history of the text and its ideas. Vartanian's keen sense for the history of ideas gives clear indication of the chronology of events and the sequence of the discussions. He is well informed about the history of the relevant sciences in his period, their previous as well as their subsequent developments, and he is thus in a position to emphasize what is important. His modest program, the editing of a book whose text may be contained in fifty octavo pages, has given us a serious</page><page sequence="2">218 BOOK REVIEWS contribution to the history of ideas as well as to our knowledge of the eighteenth century in general. La Mettrie's thought ranged freely, much too freely for the taste and susceptibili- ties of many of his contemporaries as well as for certain moderns, but it is surprising how many trails Vartanian has been able to follow and with what assurance his thought moves in areas unfamiliar to most of his colleagues in the literary and philological disciplines. The tone of his writing is admirable; he writes with lively irony and an intelligent smile, rare enough among those who discuss La Met- trie, although it is exactly right for this most exasperating of scientists. The chief of eight- eenth-century materialists was himself an iron- ist, a wit of exceptionable caliber, but all too often he has been treated facetiously, ponderously, or with indignation, all of which are wrong, for at a new reading the rogue comes up smiling with renewed intelligence. The worst castigations the pedants can give him do not demolish his thought or blunt his pene- trating insight. In Vartanian, La Mettrie has encountered a scholar who can meet him on his own ground, treat him with the critical comprehension he so obviously deserves. In his introduction Vartanian makes a good case for our recognition of La Mettrie's high rank among the philosophes, most of whom rejected him for reasons of immediate expedi- ency and no ultimate relevance. More than those of many of the group, his insights and general outloook have led to advances in some of the most typically modern areas of research and speculation. The close association of physi- ology and psychology became psychophysiolo- gy in the hands of Cabanis and was revived in this century in the controversy between E. Rignano and J. Needham, and still more recently in the new science of cybernetics developed by Norbert Wiener. Other sugges- tions of this order, concerning psychiatry, physiotherapy, even aesthetics, tend to corrob- orate the view of Vartanian's final paragraph on "the persistent vitality and indefinite prom- ise present from the first in the thesis of L'Homme Machine." Two by-products of Vartanian's work might well have been given a little emphasis: one in the area of popular nature-literature, the other in the contribution which La Mettrie's controversial position has made to the auton- omy of scientific research. L'Homme Machine may well have been composed with the inten- tion of placing man in his natural context, of making man a part of nature, incompre- hensible without his roots in the orderliness of universal laws as discovered by the scien- tists. It has also, along with its sequel, L'Homme Plante, edited a few years ago by Dr. Francis L. Rougier (New York: Institute of French Studies, 1936), contributed to estab- lishing a human frame of reference for nature. If man may be described, as La Mettrie does. in terms equating him with animals and birds, with the fauna and flora, then the step to anthropomorphic interpretations of these liv- ing things is very short, and we are well on the way to such books of popular appeal as were produced by the dozen in the vogue of a sentimentalized naturalistic thought fash- ionable in the late nineteenth century. Reading these two books suggests this outcome at several points; La Mettrie would not perhaps admit a debt to Pluche and Derham, but he could hardly reject some at least of his modern progeny. The second by-product of his work lies in the discovery, which was sometimes highly embarrassing, that workers of quite different religious outlooks could agree in matters of scientific method, on the facts and purposes of research and speculation, and even on the hypotheses necessary in any given case. There was a sense of shock at first; Haller never got over La Mettrie's impudent and yet per- haps justified dedication of L'Homme Machine, and Hieronymus Gaubius was long disturbed over La Mettrie's use of the ideas set forth in a Sermo academicus of 1747. But the scien- tific observer could soon see, and the intelli- gently devout could not fail to notice, that here was the beginning of a common effort of greater significance to the development of the European mind than the perpetuation of squabbles over distinctions of dogma and hierarchy.
