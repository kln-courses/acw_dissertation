This book is a history of the painting, sculpture, environmental art, earthworks, performances, con- ceptual elaborations and political activisms that are the art of the 1960s. It is a long book, with chapters on Pop Art, Photo-Realism, Minimal Sculpture, and the plethora of the kinds of art objects named above. It aims to be exhaustive, not in the sense of describing everything one would want to call plastic art that was made in the 1960s, but in its aim of describing all the main art movements that Sandler thinks of as defining art sensibility of the 1960s. The book then has a thesis, articulated in its first few chapters, that there was a sensibility to the 1960s which runs though this apparently disparate list of objects. This sensibility he characterizes in various places as "cool," "factual,'" " anti-anthropomorphic," "anti-historical," " anti-ex- pressive, " and drenched in an American landscape of cities, commodities and media. He thinks of this sensibility in contradistinction to that of Abstract Expressionism's search in the 1950s for an art arising out of the crossroads of twentieth century art history, and for an art of maximum expressive intensity. This opposition of sensibility he also poses, following Greenberg and Fried, as Abstract Expressionism's push away from (abstraction from) tactile values of all kinds associated with the plastic art object, towards a dematerialized, purely visual experience; as opposed to an art (of the 1960s) that focuses attention on the fact that it is an object-indeed commodity-in the world. The chapters on Pop Art and Minimalism are good at fleshing out this opposition. The phrase " 1960s sensibility" leaves it unclear as to whether Sandler believes he is describing an atti- tude held more or less by everybody at that time or whether he believes he is providing the best possible interpretation of the character of the 1960s art one can arrive at as the Siecle Fins out now twenty years later. Sandler writes as a kind of hip insider with a good feel for the 1960s; his history is an insider's history of names, places, scenes and situations. That is, the exhaustiveness of this book is a matter of its telling us what every artist exhibiting the 1960s sensibility did when and what every critic wrote about whomever. The book's play-by-play history makes it a good source document for the time. What the book is not is a searching reflection on how to interpret the art. It leaves undiscussed whether any or all of the artworks go beyond the sensibility Sandler believes was all- important to the 1960s. After telling us, for example, that Frank Stella was during the 1960s unconcerned with the "painterly" or the "expressive," Sandler mentions that Stella later said his works always had a psychological content-Sandler mentions this and makes nothing of it. But what should we make of Stella's remark? That Stella's paintings of the time are more than "cool"? This question calls for reflection we do not get from Sandler. Indeed he takes no notice of later writing on the art of the 1960s from Arthur Danto and others who impute more to the work; nor does he much discuss Rauschenberg or Johns, both of whom clearly have more in their work. Equally ig- nored are artists in the 1960s working out of the forms and forces of Abstract Expressionism (Eva Hesse, Morris Louis), for Sandler has decided in the absence of argument that there was but one basic sensibility defining the sixties. Also absent from the book is any engagement with the question of fraudulence-a question which obsessed the 1960s critics, and a crucial one for interpretation. Another problem: Sandler's chapter on the avant-garde is almost totally about which curators and galleries mattered the most. He slips into the art insider's all-too-common confla- tion of something's being in and its being original or serious. His is a failure to think through the very idea of the avant-garde-of whether there was one in the 1960s or whether there is one now. It is, however</page><page sequence="2">270 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism inadvertently, a reliance on the social power of people and institutions to define or replace concepts. Such conceptual kitsch is also, after all, part of the sen- sibility of the 1960s. (DH)</page></plain_text>
