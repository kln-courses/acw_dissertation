John Leslie Starkey was killed on January 10, 1938, by Arab bandits near Hebron in Southern Palestine. After the World War Sir Flinders Petrie took Starkey to assist him in his excava- tions in Egypt. Starkey bad no training in classics or orientology but his practical and mechanical abilities made him invaluable to the expedition. After many years of experience with the British School of Archaeology in Egypt and with the Michigan Expedition in Egypt, Starkey went to Palestine with Professor Petrie around 1926. In 1932-33 Starkey conducted his first cam- paign at Tell Duweir, the biblical Lachish. His reports for the first five campaigns have appeared in the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Ex- ploration Fund lxv, pp. 190-199; lxvi, pp. 164- 175; lxvii, pp. 198-207; lxviii, pp. 178-189; lxix, pp. 228-241. Reports have also appeared in The Illustrated London News. The Tell Duweir excava- tions have enjoyed from the very start the de- served reputation of being the best run in Palestine. His field technique was superb and he was rewarded with important finds, including the sensational Hebrew ostraca of the sixth century B.C. Starkey knew how to exhibit his discoveries effectively. His annual summer exhibition and lec- tures at the Wellcome Institute in London were very popular. He succeeded in interesting the public and thereby built up a following. He was extremely generous with his material. Every sch3lar, famous or obscure, who wanted to ex- amine Starkey's finds, was given free access to them. By his untimely death, at the age of forty-five, archaeology has lost a first class excavator. He will not be easily replaced. MESOPOTAMIA The Scorpion in Mesopotamian Art and Religion. - Mrs. E.

In astrological texts and in a kudurru from Susa the scorpion is identified with the god- dess IThara. Mrs. Van Buren traces references in the literature and artistic representations of the scorpion from the earliest times to the Parthian period. (Archiv fiir Orientforschung xii, 1937, pp. 1-98.) The Middle Assyrian Laws. - In the Archivfiir Orientforschung xii, 1937, pp. 46-54, Dr. ERNST F. WEIDNER publishes five hitherto unpublished fragments of the Middle Assyrian Laws. Weidner demonstrates conclusively (on the evidence of provenance and eponym datings) that the laws were written in the reign of Tiglatpileser I (1115- 1077 B.C.). Luristan Bronzes. - Two late Assyrian Luristan cups of bronze are published by WALTER BAUM- GARTNER in Archiv fiir Orientforschung xii, 1937, pp. 57-59. One may possibly be dated in 669 B.c., the eponymate year of B1l-mudammiq. One cup is decorated with a winged steed; the other, with a seated, bearded man, about to drink from a cup and to eat from a table covered with fruit. Un- fortunately, only one picture of each piece is given. Accordingly, only half of each scene is visible. Survey of Art.- Archaeologische Mitteilungen aus Iran viii, 3 and ix, 1, are devoted to "Die Kunst des zweiten Jahrtausends in Vorderasiens" by Professor ERNST HERZFELD. In spite of the great progress and new discov- eries in the archaeology of the Near East the his- tory of the second millennium is full of serious gaps. Scholars still use the term "Assyrian" to date seal cylinders over a period lasting eighteen hundred years! Though such a gross chronological designation is indeed surprising, it actually ap- pears in standard publications of recent date. Herzfeld's many stylistic observations are of definite interest. However, what is of special value to the student of glyptic art is that Herzfeld has assembled all of the seals that can be dated with more or less precision. Thanks to him there is now an easily accessible basis for a more exact chronology of Babylonian and Assyrian art in the second and early first millennium B.C. PALESTINE AND SYRIA The Alphabet.-In the Palestine Exploration Quarterly, July, 1937, S. YEIVIN discusses the Palestino-Sinaitic Inscriptions. The inscription on the bowl found at Lachish (which he calls Lachish II) he maintains should be read bas" liggith ye magger sh ........ He translates: "May NN overthrow for the third time (his rival XX-or something similar)." We now have seen seven inscriptions in the pre- or proto-Israelite script of the country: the Tell-el-IHesi ostracon, the Gezer ostracon, the Beth-Shemesh ostracon, Lachish I and II, an unpublished inscription from Shechem, and Lachish III (published in the Quarterly Statement, October 1936). That this script was used extensively for various purposes is inferred from these inscriptions. Thus those of Shechem, Gezer, and Lachish I are dedicatory; that of Lachish II is funerary; those of Tell-el- Hesi and Beth-Shemesh refer to daily use. Furthermore it has been possible to give these inscriptions app)roximate dates and to arrange a chronological sequence as follows: the Shechem fragment (stone) ca. 1650 B.C.; the Gezer ostracon (base of a tall censer) ca. 1600 B.c.; the Tell-el- Hesi ostracon (bowl) ca. 1350 B.C.; Lachish I (ewer) ca. 1275 B.c.; Lachish III (censer cover) dated between Lachish I and II; Lachish II (bowl) ca. 1225 B.C.; the Beth-Shemesh ostracon ca. 1200-1180 B.C. J. LEVIE, S.I., in Nouvelle Revue Thbologique, September-October, 1937, gives an account of the expeditions to Serabit el-Khadem, the discovery of the proto-Sinaitic inscriptions, and the history of their interpretation. He includes a great deal of bibliography and concludes with the view of Al- bright and Butin that the above listed finds in Palestine represent the link between the proto- Sinaitic and the Phoenician letters or alphabet. Writing. - Some important considerations grow- ing out of studies in the history of writing are treated by JOHANNES FRIEDRICH in Z.D.M.G. xci, 1937, pp. 319-342. His concern is to give at- tention, not merely to comparison of external forms of ductus, as he claims most studies have done in the past, but to an evaluation of the inner nature (the spirit of the content) of given systems of writing. Applying this principle to several sys- tems, among them the Meroitic script and the Ras Shamra cuneiform alphabet, Friedrich points out certain significant features which may furnish clues to historical relations of scripts and to prob- able external influences determining their form. Among "modern parallels to ancient inventions of writing" he introduces several new illustrations unnoticed in the standard works. A telling point</page><page sequence="3">132 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY is made in the discussion of the Bamum inscrip- tion which within twenty years (1900-1918) de- veloped from an unphonetic picture-writing to an alphabetic system; this rapid development in modern times may suggest that in ancient times also the process of evolution may in some cases have been more rapid than we have supposed. There is need for great caution in applying this postulate. There is also room for doubt concerning the implication that ancient systems of writing may have been the result of such more or less arbitrary creation of symbols, as was the case in some of the more recent examples cited. The arti- cle raises more problems than it settles, but it will doubtless stimulate further research and interpre- tation in this vast and baffling field. Nuzi Tablets. -Utilizing archaeological evi- dence from the Nuzi documents, MILLAR BUR- ROWS (J.A.O.S., September, 1937, pp. 259-276) discusses a problem involving the interpretation of an Old Testament passage (Gen. 31: 14-16) deal- ing with marriage customs in the patriarchal period. He points out a parallel in the erribu mar- riage of ancient Babylonia, in which, when there was no male descendant, continuation of the family was had through a daughter, for whom a husband was taken into the father's family. The case of the Arab mot'a marriage is similar and may have a very early origin. Burrow's interpretation of the passage in Genesis seems reasonable and conclusive as far as it goes, and furnishes an inter- esting illustration of the growing service of archaeological discovery and research in the field of exegetical study and in shedding light upon problems of cultural reconstruction. A further instance of light from cuneiform sources contributing to problems of interpretation may be seen in N. SCHNEIDER'S treatment of a reference in II Kings 23:13 concerning "Milcom, the abomination of the Ammonites (Biblica xviii, 1937, pp. 337-343). Hurrian Names.-One of a series of recently published articles by Dr. LEO OPPENHEIM on the Hurrian personal names in the Nuzi tablets (fif- teenth century B.C.) is published in Archiv fiir Orientforschung xii, 1937, pp. 29-39. The Nuzi tablets were discovered by American excavators near Kirkuk. These studies bid fair to add to our meagre knowledge of Hurrian grammar and vocabulary. They also shed light on the Hurrian pantheon, for the names naturally contain many theophoric elements. Hebrew.- The publication by JIRKU and CERNY of Palestinian names in early Egyptian texts suggests that as early as the beginning of the second millennium B.C. a population which may be called Hebrew had a footing in the extreme south of Palestine. This agrees with the narrative of Genesis which describes the wandering and sojourn of Abraham in the south of the Negeb of Judah. Dr. Jack suggests that many of these Hebrews may have found employment in the mines of Edom and Sinai long before Jacob and his family went down into Egypt. (Palestine Exploration Quarterly, July, 1937.) Khafaje.-A report on the most recent dis- coveries at Khafaje by Professor HENRI FRANK- FORT, Director of the Iraq Expedition of the Oriental Institute, is published in I.L.N., Novem- ber 13, 1937, pp. 840-841. Most of the season of 1936-37 was devoted to further excavation on the site of the Moon-God's temple. The uppermost level dates in the Early Dynastic period. The five levels below this belong to the Jemdet Nasr Period. Owing to the height of the ground water- level it was impossible to dig any lower. The most interesting small finds of the Jemdet Nasr period were the cylinder seals, which were found in great quantities. Two seals were discovered which were survivals from the earlier Uruk period. They are the oldest objects yet discovered at Khafaje. Lachish.- A report on the fifth season's exca- vations at Tell Duweir, ancient Lachish, by the late J. L. STARKEY, Director of the Wellcome Marston Archaeological Research Expedition to the Near East, appears in I.L.N., November 27, 1937, pp. 944-946, and 968. A number of tombs, most of which had been plundered in antiquity, were cleared. Many beads, scarabs and seals were found, covering the period from late Hyksos to early Ramesside times (1600-1250 B.c.). The pot- tery found forms an unbroken series for the same period. Fragments of three bowls bore inscriptions in cursive hieroglyphic script. They are dated on palaeographic evidence in the last quarter of the thirteenth century B.c. This date is confirmed by other objects found in the same context, including remains of vases copied from Aegean types. These show a commercial connection with Mediterra- nean centers of culture. Further evidence was re- vealed supporting the conclusions drawn from earlier excavations that the city suffered complete destruction at the end of this period. One of the most important small finds was a bronze dagger from an intact Hyksos burial, not later than 1600 B.C. On the blade were four signs of a pictographic</page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 133 script. They are the earliest datable alphabetic signs so far found in Palestine, being about 350 years earlier than the Duweir Ewer. Reports on the excavation at Lachish were also published in the Palestine Exploration Quarterly, July and October, 1937. The following additional notes were taken from these articles. The residence of the Persian governor has been excavated. In the palace was found a shrine for sun-worship. The axis is due east and west, and the entrance of the inner sanctuary is open to the rising sun. On the flight of steps leading up to the sanctuary was a square limestone altar. On opposite sides was the figure of a man with upraised arms and a human hand in relief. A single right hand is a recognized attribute of the deity, when blessing or prospecting his votaries, while two hands raised are the usual oriental form of supplication. These symbols are associated almost exclusively with the sun as the god of justice. This shrine probably represents the last phase of the re-occupied city, and may be even as late as the end of the third century B.C. A seal found in the excavations bears a very interesting inscription in Hebrew characters: "For Shefatyahu 'Ashyahu." The script favors a date about 600 B.C. In the upper register is the figure of the winged serpent facing an "ankh" or sign of life. It is interesting that these pagan symbols are used by a man whose name is com- pounded with the name of YHWH. If we take the second name as that of his father, it appears that heathen sympathies persisted through two genera- tions who appear to be followers of YHWH. During the last excavation two scarabs were found bearing the name of the Hyksos king Pepa (Apophis). Two burnt levels of the city were un- earthed. The upper one may be equated with the final Chaldaean attack the time to which the Lachish Letters belong.iThe earlier or lower level may tentatively be assigned to the first threat on Judah's independence (597 B.C.). The fragments of a pottery bowl with an inscription in hieratic of the thirteenth and twelfth centuries B.c. show that the authorities at Lachish used the Egyptian calendar and the Egyptian system of numeration. The four pictographic signs on the dagger are also important. The two central pictographs form part of the Sinaitic signary; of the other two, the upper one is quite new, but the lower one occurs on early inscribed objects from Crete and the Aegean. The dagger has been dated not later than 1600 B.C., and shows by its workmanship that it was of local origin. Mari.- The most recent report on the excava- tions at Mari appears in I.L.N., October 30, 1937, pp. 763-765. It is by Professor ANDRE PARROT, Director of the Louvre Expedition at Abu Kemal on the Euphrates. The most important finds this season were mural paintings. Some were found in 8itu; others had collapsed and were pieced together in part from the hundreds of fragments recovered from the debris on the floor. The subjects are varied. On some of the pieces scenes of sacrifices and religious ceremonies are represented; on another, the investiture of the king; on others, realistic scenes of date-gathering and fishing. These murals, which are dated about 2000 B.C., will prove very important in a study of the origin of painting. Ras Shamra.- Dr. SCHAEFFER reports the dis- covery of a jeweller's scales and weights hidden beneath the floor of his shop. The significant point is that the weights appear to be based on a talent of 3000 shekels, which was the early Hebrew standard, as opposed to the talent of 3600 shekels which was the standard in Sumerian and Baby- lonian currency. (Palestine Exploration Quarterly, July, 1937.) Ras Shamra Texts. - The theory of Virolleaud and Dussaud that in the Legend of Keret and the Poem of the Gracious Gods we have memories of an early Phoenician settlement in the Negeb of Palestine and of its relations with Edom is sub- jected to a searching criticism by Pere R. DE VAUX in Rev. Bib. xlvi, 1937, pp. 526-555. He points out that, if the Legend of Keret refers to southern Palestine, this region must have been well settled and highly developed. But that is contrary to the evidence of the Egyptian references, the Tell el- Amarna letters, and the Bible, which knows it only as a land of Bedouins. The Udmu of the texts cannot possibly refer to Edom, because Edom did not come into existence until after 1300 B.c. Pere de Vaux suggests another topographical setting for the Keret legend. The twin cities of Udmu he would locate at the mounds of ed- Ddmieh, the Adami han-neqeb of Josh. 19:33, about twelve kilometers west of Lake Tiberias. Four kilometers south of this point is the village of Sarona, corresponding to the Sharna of the legend. Ten kilometers northwest lies kh.Sa'd, marking the site of Sa'at of the legend. Two kilo- meters southwest is the village of Kefr Sabt with two springs, the equivalent of the fountain of Shebt of the legend, while the spring of Mimlat in the legend is 'Ain Mimla, about twelve kilometers</page><page sequence="5">134 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY to the north. This remarkable similarity between the ancient and modern topography can scarcely be accidental. The Phoenician pantheon was substantially as follows: At the head stood El, the supreme god, often called melek, "king" (0. T. Moloch). Since el is a common noun, his proper name was probably Dagon. He had two sons: M6t and Baal (since baal is another common noun his real name was prob- ably Hadad). The struggles between M6t and Baal represent the alternation of the seasons. The supreme goddess is called Elat, or Asherat, the latter being her real name. Her two daughters are Anat, the queen of the sky (the moon), and Shapash (the sun). To the numerous Old Testa- ment passages enlightened by the Ras Shamra texts Pere de Vaux adds Isaiah 14:12-15. Tell-Agrab.-A brief report on the campaign conducted during the winter of 1936-37 at Tell- Agrab, by Professor HENRI FRANKFORT, Field Director of the Iraq Expedition of the Oriental Institute, is published in I.L.N., November 6, 1937, pp. 792-795 and color plate I. Excavation was continued on the site of the early dynastic temple. Some very interesting and important small finds were made in the sanctuary. Some of the earliest objects probably formed part of the temple treasury. The latest date from the last period of occupation, about 2700 B.C. The most interesting piece was a miniature copper chariot drawn by four asses. Despite the fact that it is only three inches in height, details of the chariot and harness are rendered realistically. 'hree cop- per statues were also found. Scenes of fights be- tween wild animals are represented on a limestone box-lid and on cylinder seals of the earlier period. A sculptured mace-head of gypsum ornamented with lions' heads dates in the later period. Some fragments of the early painted pottery (about 3000 B.C.) are shown in color. The repeated occur- rence of representations of bulls, especially in connection with ceremonies of worship, seems to imply that they were sacred animals. Relations between Egypt and Palestine.-A very able discussion by R. K6PPEL (Biblica xviii, 1937, pp. 443-449) of the relation between Ma'adi and Ghassal states that, while partial and super- ficial comparison of materials from these two sites leads to a view that they demonstrate relations between the two countries (Egypt and Palestine), a more detailed comparison shows greater differ- ences than similarities in ceramics, flints, build- ings, etc. between the two settlements. The prob- lem of origin of the wavy ledge handle (whether in Palestine or Egypt) comes into the discussion, but Kippel sees no light on this from Ghassfil. Con- clusive evidence is still awaited for light upon the possible correlations between prehistoric phases of Egypt and Syria-Palestine, especially in the fourth millennium. Excavations in the Plain of Amk. - Sir LEONARD WOOLLEY gives an account of his first season's work in the plain of Amk: "The splendid building with the colonnade and the big house of our fourth level are definitely Hittite; every detail of their architecture is reproduced in later Hittite build- ings, and their pottery leaves no doubt upon the point. That they should be Hittite and should date back to the sixteenth century B.C. is a fact of real historical importance. The known Syro-Hittite buildings are late, and it has generally been sup- posed that the capture of Aleppo by Tudkalia of Boghazkeui about 1420 B.C. marked the beginning of Hittite domination in North Syria; a Hittite invasion of Babylonia by Hattusil late in the 19th century B.C. was regarded as a mere raid having no permanent consequences. Now we find the Hit- tites settled in North Syria long before the fif- teenth century, quite possibly as a result of Hat- tusil's conquests; the frequent references in the Old Testament to Hittites living in Syria and Palestine in the patriarchal age, which have often been rejected as anachronisms, may yet prove to be sound history." (Palestine Exploration Fund, July, 1937.) HITTITE Hittite Hieroglyphs.--B. HROZNY has con- tinued the decipherment of the Hittite hiero- glyphs. In Archiv Orientdlni, May, 1936, he trans- lates a "Hittite" hieroglyphic inscription on a stele from Kaiseri. He includes a photograph of the four sides of the monument and appends a complete transliteration. A descendant of prince Valu-Dadamemos placed a large jar of provisions in a vestibule and dedicated it perhaps to the manes of his father. Imprecations are uttered against anyone who takes possession of the vesti- bule and the jar. Gods and demons will punish the offender. The inscription is dated about the tenth century B.C. In the issue of August 1936, he translates the inscriptions on four basalt altars from Emir Ghazi and Eski Killa, to the east of Konia; they are reproduced in photographs with translitera- tion. The great king Tutbalijas (probably the IV,</page><page sequence="6">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 135 ca. 1250 B.c.) dedicated them to the tree god Mel(a)satamas, to the god Apulunas (Apollo ?), the goddess Rutas, and a fourth divinity. In the same number, Hrozn' gives photographs with transliteration of inscriptions from Karakuyu, Fraktin, and Kara Dagh (I-VI), and a stele from Boghazkeui. The inscriptions from Kara Dagh show that toward the end of the second millen- nium B.C. there was in that place a great centre of "Hittite" hieroglyphs. In this number Hrozn5y also reproduces the obelisk of Izgin and translates the inscription. Prince Dadas had enlarged the border of his kingdom and erected buildings in the capital, Malatia. The obelisk was placed in Salias (probably Izgin), which was the centre of a prov- ince over which he had placed Arnuvanta. The characters resemble those of the eleventh or tenth century B.C. Perhaps during the epoch of the dynasty of Barmeta (Barata ?) there was an ex- pansion by the princes of Malatia, as is shown by this obelisk. In the issue of April-June, 1937, Hroznjy con- siders the important and celebrated relief upon a rock at Ivriz. The god Santajas is represented as holding in his hands a vine laden with bunches of grapes and four stalks of wheat which terminate in large ears. He is being adored by king Varpalavas of Tuvana (Tyana). While he was the prince royal, he had planted a garden which his grand- father Valu-Dadas had dedicated to the god Santajas and offered that deity a libation. Matusa, the father of Varpalavas made a similar libation, in which he was followed by his son. This Var- palavas is the same as Urpalla of Tyana, a con- temporary of Tiglath-Pileser III (746-728 B.C.). Apparently this Varpalavas is the second, while the first to bear this name was his great-grand- father. CYPRUS Cypriote Sculpture.-E. GJERSTAD discusses (Arch. Anz., 1936, cols. 561-586) the development of style in Cypriote sculpture. The most valuable site for the archaic period is Ajia Irini, where some two thousand votive figures of terracotta, from twenty centimeters tall to life-size, were set up in a temenos. Three times between 625 and 500 B.C. the level of the temenos was raised by sand and gravel as the result of flood. After the first two floods the older sculptures were left as they were and new ones were placed on the higher level. Hence there is a clear division into three chrono- logical groups: 625-560 B.C., 560-525 B.C., and 525-500 B.c. In the sculpture seven styles are dis- tinguished: I, 600-560; II, 600-550; III and IV, 570-525; V, 560-525; VI, 550-500; VII, 525-500. Stone sculptures found at Arsos, in southeastern Cyprus, are divided into five stylistic groups, which are dated by comparison with Ajia Irini. Then four styles for Cyprus in general are estab- lished: Native Cypriote (625-525); Cypro- Egyptian (beginning ca. 560); Neo-Cypriote, where Egyptian and Greek influences are evident (550-500); and Cypro-Greek (540, at earliest, to 500). The original population had connections with North Syria and Anatolia in race as in art; the assimilation of Greek style resulted partly from the existence of a Greek element in the popu- lation after 1200 B.C. For sculpture from 500 to 380 B.C. the most valuable site is Vouni. From 450 B.C. on native character was largely lost and Greek style was weakly imitated, partly because political feeling led the people to consider themselves Greeks rather than Cypriotes. In the Hellenistic period there was a Cypriote renaissance, known largely from Soli. GREECE GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Art of Archaic Greece.- About the twelfth century B.C., the Doric invaders destroyed pre- Hellenic civilization, especially that of Minoan Crete and of Mycenaean Greece, and inaugurated another culture. As a result, archaic Greek art of the succeeding centuries was exceedingly primi- tive since almost everything had to be relearned. By the end of the seventh century it had accom- plished much of this task and had prepared the way for the Classicism of the fifth century, even though it was radically different from the latter. This seeming contradiction is resolved by a con- sideration of the unique development of primitive art in Greece. Primitivism begins everywhere by being emi- nently utilitarian and uninterested in detached or aesthetic aims. Primitive drawing and low relief represent the human body with each part showing to the greatest advantage. Accordingly, the eye is so rendered that it can be seen entirely in a profile head; and the same principle accounts for the frontality of the torso joined to legs represented in profile. Likewise, the characters intended for the background are superimposed, rising above those in front either by their heads alone or by their entire bodies. In short, foreshortening and perspective, such as we conceive these to be, are</page><page sequence="7">136 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY systematically repudiated, less on account of possible technical incapacity on the part of the artist than on account of his mental attitude toward the interpretation of forms. Primitivismr seems to see reality only in two dimensions. Furthermore, Primitivism does not wish to represent nature as it appears to the eye but pre- fers to subject it to mental designs, to make its irregular appearances regular by restoring these, as it were, to the geometrical forms from which they have strayed. The primitive artist thereby escapes the necessity of making a ceaseless study of nature, in order to correct transcriptions with a view to greater fidelity. As a result, the observa- tion of Primitivism is deficient, often incorrect, since once the schematic outlines have been es- tablished they become traditional and serve as models from which succeeding artists take their inspiration as a matter of routine. Although the art of archaic Greece resembled the Primitivism of Egypt and the Orient in these respects, it showed marked differences. First and foremost, it displayed its deep-seated originality in the choice of its themes. Whereas elsewhere the human form did not arouse an exclusive interest but was associated with plants and animals, the anthropomorphic spirit of Greece prompted the archaic artist to conceive of the gods as more human than they were elsewhere conceived. In this way the representation of the human form became the essential objective of archaic art, so that progressively man came to be the chief, and with Classicism almost the sole, object on the plain background of vases and reliefs. The gymnastic exercises and athletic contests of Greece not only gave the archaic artist the opportunity to study the nude body and to learn better and better the forms, dimensions, and mutual relations of its skeletal framework and its muscularity, but also inclined him to portray the body nude as a thing of beauty in itself. Art is indebted, therefore, to Archaism for this fecund innovation. Clothing, too, no longer plays only a utilitarian r6le, as it does elsewhere in primitive art. In the eyes of the archaic artist it is beautiful for its texture and for the variety of folds that it forms on the body; and thus it becomes for him, and for him alone, an aesthetic factor no less important than that of nudity. Since the law of frontality forbids the repre- sentation of a statue in motion, the archaic artist utilizes the principles of the arts of projection, drawing and relief, to construct a statue in motion in full relief. This innovation is equal in impor- tance to the preceding ones, for no other art of antiquity knew it. The artist also begins to avoid repetition and exact symmetry, which are char- acteristic principles of Primitivism, and seeks instead to reproduce the manifold variety and irregularity which nature itself presents. High relief was also a creation of the archaic Greek artist; for his increasing sense of reality could not content itself any longer with only two dimensions. Similarly, his attempts at foreshort- ening in drawing show a desire to penetrate the background and to give to bodies their natural corporeity. These new concepts of reality and of beauty are extended to the choice of materials. In sculpture, wood, clay and limestone are gradually rejected for substances that are more beautiful and more satisfactory: marble, which reproduces human flesh, especially that of women, wonderfully well; and bronze, which shows to the best advantage the solid contours of the athlete's body. In these novel ways the archaic Greek artist substituted for the intellectual realism of Primi- tivism his own optical realism. Accordingly, he refused more and more to repeat routine formulae which his prolonged examination of nature had proved to be incorrect and untrue in many de- tails. By doing so, he also introduced in art the idea of progress, in the sense of continual better- ment. The continuance of Primitivism in Greece was definitely related to the fact that Greek culture of the archaic period was influenced profoundly by Egypt and the Orient, to which Greece was united by close commercial and political relations. The victory of Greece over the Persians awoke the national feeling and a national pride in things Greek. Art reflected these events by turning away from the Orient, and the definite break of Archa- ism with Primitivism was effected precisely at this time. The Primitivism of Greece had run its course almost entirely by 500 B.c. As soon as it turned its back completely on the confining in- fluences of tradition and directed its full and free attention to the development of those novel ideas which it had itself engendered, it matured into Classicism. (W. Deonna, R. Arch. x, 1937, pp. 3-26.) Excavations conducted by the Greek Archaeo- logical Society.-Professor GEORGE OIKONOMOS has summarized the work conducted under the</page><page sequence="8">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 137 auspices of the Greek Archaeological Society in the year 1936 in the Pralctika of the Society for 1936, pp. 1-N26. The Ephemeris for 1936 is almost completed and will appear shortly as well as the volume for 1937, a centenary memorial issue, to which scholars all over the world have contrib- uted. More elaborate reports on the individual excavations are published by the Directors, as follows: Achaia. - Dr. N. KYPARISSIS continued his investigation of the Mycenaean cemeteries dur- ing the year 1936 and a brief report is published by him, pp. 95-99. Work was concentrated on the cemetery of the third prehistoric site, located around Patras, which was found by the ridge of Koukoura near the winery of Klauss. The ceme- tery apparently consists of chamber tombs and the most characteristic contents are vases of late Mycenaean shapes with a geometric decoration. One of the graves alone yielded fifty-five com- plete vases. A bronze spearhead, beads and whorls are also among the finds. All these vases are now exhibited in the Museum at Patras. Amnisos.- Dr. SP. MARINATOS reports briefly on his work at Amnisos, pp. 81-86. The objective of the 1936 campaign was to determine the extent of the sanctuary. It was proved that it extends considerably to the south and to the west, but at the close of the exploration its boundaries were not definitely determined. The sections uncovered belong to the Roman Period and apparently were used by the personnel of the temple. Among the rich finds most important is a badly preserved fe- male head made of poros stone. The eyes were in- serted and apparently were of ivory or bone. Such an eye, made of ivory, discovered in 1935, was found to fit in the socket of the left eye. The excavator believes that the head is archaistic, al- though it reminds one strongly of Dedalic prod- ucts. Pieces of a subgeometric pithos, bearing on its surface seals with the representation of a run- ning horse; fragments of votive offerings of clay and bronze; bone needles; and five inscriptions of Roman times are also among the finds. Eleusis. - Dr. K. KOUROUNIOTES and Mr. JOHN TRAVLOS describe and illustrate their valu- able conclusions on the course of the Eleusinian Sacred Way, pp. 27-34. The course of this road to the temple of Aphrodite was well known and could easily be seen at a short distance from the modern highway. The latest investigation proved that beyond the temple the road forked. The right branch crossed the mountainous ridge which sepa- rates the coast of Skaramanga and the lake of the Rheitoi, and passing through the small valley of the Rheitoi, it reached the Thriasian plain. The left branch of the main road followed the direc- tion and the line of the modern road up to a point beyond the ridge, and then forked again. One of its branches connected with the road which was carried over the ridge, while the other, running along the coast line, was continued to Eleusis. Sections of these roads were cleared at various points. Their width varied from four to five me- ters and they were paved by small and larger stones carefully fitted. In the course of the study of the Sacred Way, the foundations of a stone building, perhaps a "Pharos," were discovered on the low hill to the north of the lake of the Rheitoi. In pages 34-40 Dr. Kourouniotes describes briefly the large Roman house which he and Mr. Travlos uncovered last year. This house, the best preserved in Greece, is located immediately below the small Museum of Eleusis. It is divided into fourteen rooms. It measures 96.50 x 13.50 meters, and is oriented from north to south. Beautiful colored mosaics cover the floors of the rooms and of the court; photographs of these are given. Kalamitsa.-Mr. G. BAKALAKIS continued the exploration of the structure discovered in 1935 on this site, and a brief report of his work is given on pp. 74-81. The building is composed of three divisions, in two of which stone hearths were found. In the filling of the structure were found a great many sherds among which were two pieces belonging to a black-figured vase with a scene of a chariot and hoplites. These and other fragments of pottery seem to indicate that Kalamitsa was inhabited in the sixth century B.C. A number of inscribed handles of amphorae were also found. Marathon. -Professor GEORGE SOTERIADES, continuing his investigations in the valley of Marathon, verified a number of points which will enable him to make a complete study of the topog- raphy of that section of Attica (pp. 41-49). Megara.- The work conducted at Megara in 1936 is briefly described by Mr. JOHN THREP- SIADES, pp. 43-56. Excavation was carried on at two points. In the small square on the north- western slope of Karia, was uncovered a large structure of Roman times, apparently a bath. It was used in later times also and until the sixth century A.D., because within its area some graves were found contemporary with nineteen coins of Justinian and his immediate successors, also found in the structure. Below the foundations of the</page><page sequence="9">138 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY bath remains of an older building were uncov- ered dating from the end of the fifth and the be- ginning of the fourth century B.c. The cave of Mourmouni was the second area which was in- vestigated. Thus far only remains of the Roman period have been discovered, but the work has not as yet been completed. It is hoped that fur- ther work will prove that the cave was used for ritualistic purposes. Nea Anchialos. -Professor GEORGE SOTERIOU gives a brief report of his investigations at Nea Anchialos, pp. 57-67. During the year 1936 he completely uncovered the fourth Christian basil- ica of Thessalian Thebes, which dates from the beginning or the middle of the seventh century. This basilica proved very interesting because it exhibits unusual features. The ground plan of the basilica proper is given a cruciform shape by the addition of two rectangular rooms at the side of each of the aisles. Two rectangular rooms are also added to the ends of the narthex, and two more are placed on either side of the apse. The latter apparently were used for burial purposes and through a door connected with the side aisles. A large section of the atrium was also cleared. Of special interest are the mosaics which were found covering the aisles and the side chambers. The mosaics of the aisles exhibit geometric patterns, while those of the chambers are enlivened by representations of birds, animals and fish. The floors of the narthex and nave are paved with marble. A number of pieces of architectural and decorative sculpture were found which corrobo- rate the evidence obtainable from the mosaics as to the date of the basilica. Of interest are a num- ber of Aramaic tomb inscriptions proving the existence of a Jewish colony in Thebes in the early centuries of the Christian era. (Cf. A.J.A. xli, 1937, pp. 337-338.) Palaeopolis.--A brief report by Messrs. A. XYNGOPOULOS and J. PAPADIMITRIOU on the basilica of Palaeopolis described by Mrs. E. P. Blegen in the A.J.A. xli, 1937, p. 338, appears in the Praktika, pp. 99-110. Also, a report by Mr. M. KALLIGAS on the work which he carried on in Saloniki, in the Church of Santa Sophia, is pub- lished, pp. 111-118. Sikyon.-A brief report by Professor A. OR- LANDOS on his work in Sikyon appears on pp. 86-94. The excavator continued his investiga- tions in the gymnasium of that city. By the south- ernmost fountain, which is now partially re- stored, he found a flight of twenty steps, 1.35 m. wide, leading to the lower terrace. The South Stoa of the upper terrace was also cleared. A num- ber of architectural members found in it will make possible the reconstruction of the stoa, and they prove further that the stoa was made during the third century A.D., after the great destruction of the city by an earthquake, which took place in the second century A.D. A number of graves acci- dentally discovered a short distance from the village of Moulki were also explored. They yielded aryballoid vases and small red-figured lekythoi of the fourth century. On one of them Thetis is represented bringing weapons to Achilles. At a site known today as Tragana, within the circuit of archaic Sikyon, more graves be- longing to the fifth century were discovered and cleared. They yielded a number of vases and a bronze mirror of exquisite workmanship. This object has already been described and illustrated in the A.J.A. xli, 1937, pp. 336-337. Western Macedonia.- The investigations car- ried out in Western Macedonia by Professor KERAMOPOULLOS are briefly reported on pp. 67-73. They centered around the village of Syn- dendron, to the west of Grevena, where various antiquities were found at times by the teacher of the village. Near the site of Svatos, remains of an ancient fortified village constructed on the principle employed by Philip the Second were un- covered. The most interesting of the objects found is the handle of a bronze oinochoi? bearing a female head at its base. Apparently the site was occupied in prehistoric times, since a great quan- tity of prehistoric sherds and some stone tools were found on its surface. A small museum was started at Grevena where the antiquities from the surrounding area are being collected. Greek Archaeology.- R. Et. Gr. 1, 1937, pp. 67-153, presents the usual Archaeological Bulle- tin, an excellent summary in some detail, having the purpose of bringing up to date, since the pre- ceding year, the entire field of work in Greek archaeology. The sections on numismatics, glyp- tics and goldsmithing are postponed to a later issue. Wheat. - C. WEICKERT publishes (Arch. Anz., 1936, cols. 586-595), in a eulogy of Wolters, a golden wheat-plant, "once held by the hand of a priestess of Demeter in a grave at Syracuse." ARCHITECTURE The Older Parthenon.- W. B. DINsMOOR (Jb. Arch. I. lii, 1937, pp. 3-13) and W. DORP-</page><page sequence="10">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 139 FELD (ibid., pp. 14-16), who had written at length on the problem of the Older Parthenon, comment briefly on recent contributions (cf. A.J.A. xli, 1937, p. 320). According to Dins- moor, Zschietzschmann's early date (540 B.c.) for the beginning of work connected with the temple is disproved by sherds of the period 510- 490 B.C. in the lower layers of the "Porosschutt." As for Kolbe's date, 479 B.C., three points are considered. There not only is no evidence that the humus stratum extended beyond the Myce- naean wall, but the steep slope, the appearance of the wall, and the excavators' testimony make the contrary certain. Three potsherds are fully dis- cussed and found not to support Kolbe. What- ever the origin of the redness of poros blocks in the substructure of the Parthenon, the drums from the columns of the older Parthenon are un- questionably burned and calcined; hence they are pre-Persian. D6rpfeld approves Dinsmoor's reply to Kolbe, but still maintains that there were two projected pre-Periclean temples, both before 490 B.c. He will discuss the whole matter in his book "Die Haupttempel der Akropolis." SCULPTURE Boeotian Sculpture. -R. LULLIES publishes (Jb. Arch. I. li, 1936, pp. 137-153) a study of early Boeotian sculpture. As Furtwingler had recognized, there was no independent Boeotian art, but the distinct provincial character was re- tained in sculpture as in other fields. A kouros head in native limestone from Ptoion resembles in some points very early things, but is incon- sistent in style and belongs to 550-525. A head from Eleusis, imitated from the Attic Rampin head, is similarly inconsistent and Boeotian of about the same date. Boeotian kouroi differ from Attic in the manner in which single parts and features are unadjusted to one another, the flat rendering of the body, the hard modeling of the surface, and the unorganic indications of ana- tomical structure. Details are borrowed from Attic works without regard to their significance. The Strangford Apollo is Boeotian, as is another Apollo in the British Museum. A small limestone statuette in the Louvre, hitherto considered very early, is Boeotian of the sixth century. The Barracco Kriophoros is copied from a Boeotian archaizing original. Some Apollos show influence from the islands rather than from Attica. The stele of Dermys and Kitylos was made soon after 550 B.c. A stele in Boston is typically Boeotian. Various other sculptures are mentioned. Even in palmettes Boeotian style is discernible. The Frieze of the Erechtheum. -In completion of his previous study (cf. A.J.A. xli, 1937, p. 196) L. PALLAT publishes a sketched reconstruction, with existing fragments placed, of the frieze of the north porch of the Erechtheum (Jb. Arch. I. lii, 1937, pp. 17-29). The accompanying text ex- plains certain differences in detail from his earlier work, and gives the sources for the reconstruction where no fragments exist; usually these are vase- paintings of the Kertch style. The chest of Erich- thonios is shown twice on the north side, though no fragment of it exists. Parthenon Metopes.-In R. Et. Gr. 1, 1937, pp. 175-205, CH. PICARD discusses the Iliupersis of the Delphic leschd on the northern metopes of the Parthenon. It is proposed to read the metope frieze in the same direction as the Panathenaic frieze, from the northwest angle to the northeast angle, reversing the sequence of Praschniker. The north triglyph frieze was sculptured following the Gigantomachy of the East side with which it is related; the north side showing the fatal night of Ilium, as referred to by both the Little Iliad and the Aeneid, coming naturally between the rising of the moon and the sun rising from the waters, Praschniker's XXIX and I respectively. The west and south sides taken together form another distinct "climatic" pair, the effect being as though the temple were cut by a diagonal from northwest to southeast. At Delphi the figure of Antenor, at Athens that of Aeneas, forms the center of an act of pardon and release at the hands of Zeus. The Cnidian leschei at Delphi was painted by Polygnotos before 458. It is very likely, if not certain, that Pheidias examined it and imitated it in the sculpture we are studying. Aeneas' ances- try in Erichthonios, and the Dardanian tradi- tions gave the Trojan refugee a peculiar place in Athens, which Antenor could not touch. Reading the north metopes from right to left gives the judgment of mercy, Aeneas with his father and Ascanius, Aphrodite as protectress as Aeneas guides Anchises-the classic Greeks would never have had him carried like a dwarf- Creusa stand- ing immobile and detached, as in the Aeneid. Interesting suggestions of the Aeneid make one believe that Vergil may have had the frieze in mind when he wrote his poem. The embarcation scene follows upon the powerlessness of Menelaus in the presence of Helen, and in it we see a young man quieting a frightened horse (not a centaur:</page><page sequence="11">140 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY cf. Pausanias' description of the lesch&amp;!), de- mobilization, going on board and the like, much as in the pictures at Delphi. The order from west to east (right to left.) was the order of the Panathenaic procession, permit- ting the members of the cortege to meditate in parallel as they passed on both the Panathenaic frieze and the moral lessons of the Sack of Ilium, the greatest punishment that gods had inflicted upon men, the lesson of Nemesis, and in a sense of the personal victory of their own great goddess Athena. The paper is valuable for many small details, such as suggestive comments on origins in both art and literature. EPIGRAPHY Geranos.-In R. Et. Anc. xxxviii, 1936, pp. 413-415, R. VALLOIS writes of the so-called Geranos ('i KacovlpEvrl yipavos) listed in the treasure of the Artemision of Delos. Through the temple-inventories we know certain facts about this anathema but are unable to form a clear conception of just what the object was. Refer- ences to it are found in C.I.G. II2, 2, 1, p. 282, No. 1643, 11. 13-14 (364 B.C.); C.I.G. XI, 161, B (279 B.C.) and 162, B (278 B.C.); F. Durrbach, Inscr. de Delos, 296 B, 399 B (192 B.C.); F. Durr- bach and P. Roussel, Inscr. de DMlos, 1444 (192 B.C.). The Geranos in these lists of the Delian am- phictyones, hieropoioi and (later) Athenian treas- urers is mentioned along with silver finger-rings and earrings; it had a necklace around it or hang- ing from it; piAa ... . &amp;Tr6 TI yEpdvou, OAhKf H[H]r are listed; the adjective &amp;pyupa is twice applied to it; its weight seems to have diminished from 4428 to 3860 drachmae (or, in- cluding perhaps an Athenian restoration, to 3900 drachmae). Vallois had once regarded it as a statue of one of the dancers of the "crane-dance," adorned with jewelry, but at present he wonders if it may not have been a garment like a coat- of-mail (dtucvalTr6s) which may, by its shape or appearance have suggested a crane (yipavos). Mantinea.- MARGHERITA GUARDUCCI inter- prets anew "Un Giudizio del Santuario di Alea a Mantinea" (I.G. V, 2, 262). Conclusions: the thirteen persons named in the first lines of the inscriptions were convicted by the goddess and by a court; the penalties were confiscation and exile; the convicts' property including slaves be- came the property of the goddess; such houses as were not occupied by the slaves, however, became the property of the citizens of Mantinea, in the absence of any state treasury (cf. the pro- posal in 483-2 regarding the product of the mines of Laurium); finally the goddess' curse is imposed on those of the thirteen convicts who actually perpetrated, not merely witnessed, the murder in Alea's sanctuary of certain men and a girl, and this is, therefore, the crime for which the thirteen had been tried. (Stud. e Mater. di Stor. d. Relig. xiii, 1937, pp. 57-67.) Spartan Offering at Olympia.-In Atti della Pontificia Accademia Romana di Archeologia (Series 3), Rendiconti, xii, 1936, pp. 125-132, MARGHERITA GUARDUCCI advances a new theory about the qi66\rl or &amp;acrris affixed as a votive offering to the a&amp;'Trcova of the temple of Zeus at Olympia by the Spartans and their allies to commemorate their victory over the Athenians at Tanagra in 457 B.C. According to Pausanias (V, 10, 4), the &amp;adrris Xpuca was beneath the gold statue of Nike, which crowned the eastern pediment of the temple, and he states that the epigram on (?) the shield (-r6 i Trl -rfi tarrfi81) showed who were the donors of the shield and the occasion of their offering it. It reads as follows: Na6s p v pdiAahav Xpuav EXEI, ?K 85 Tavaypas&lt; -rol AaKESalp6vo O-UVppc(Xia "T' a v[]EV~8P pov &amp;rr' 'ApyEicov Kai 'Ai avaicov KCi Icvcjvlv 5EKO-rav ViKaS EVEKa Tr) TCaOhrAEpW. The discovery of three fragments of a marble stele (Dittenberger-Purgold, Inschr. v. Olympia, 253; Tod, Histor. Inscr., 27), decreasing in breadth toward the top, and bearing the identical epigram in vertical lines, to be read from top to bottom, seemed to require interpreting the words of Pausanias, Tri -rf dx&amp;oriri, as not meaning written "on the shield," but rather "near the shield," or better, "relating to the shield." The stele can hardly have formed a base for the shield or the Nike, for its letters, slightly more than two cm. in height could certainly not have been leg- ible at a height of more than twenty cm. Further- more it has traces of two additional lines below, which probably stated the names of Sparta's allies. Moreover Pausanias' text reads r)c -roAMPco -the Doric form-while the inscription reads -rO Tro[. ..., and the use of OY (for 0) and the sign X at such an early date shows that the inscription is Corinthian and not Spartan. This was formerly explained by supposing that the Spartans had commissioned the Corinthians to fabricate and set up the shield. All these diffi- culties lead Guarducci to conclude that this can-</page><page sequence="12">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 141 not possibly have been the inscription read by Pausanias. She supposes, comparing an &amp;to-rri on the treasury of the Megarians, which is re- ferred to as "Nhyovaa" (i.e. as itself uttering words), that a large concave disk (qIylAa), per- haps two meters in diameter, proportionate to the size and grandeur of the temple, may have covered, like an acroterion, the apex of the pedi- ment beneath a sculptured Nike, and that this bore in letters legible from below the epigram quoted by Pausanias. With this hypothesis ac- cepted, there is no reason to suppose that the Corinthians fashioned this shield-like disk, since the Spartans (e.g. Gitiades in the sixth century) were famous for their work in bronze. The rude- ness of the poem is better suited to Sparta, more famous for skill in arms than for grace in poetry. The author touches rather lightly on the possible reason for the erection of the stone stele, repeat- ing the epigram in Corinthian letters, but thinks that it too may have been set up not long after the victory but had disappeared before Pausan- ias' time. This date (457 B.C.) furnishes then an important terminus ante quem for the completion of the temple of Zeus, which was probably fin- ished in time for the celebration of the Olympian games in 456 B.C. NUMISMATICS Coin Hoards. - SYDNEY P. NOE has made an extremely valuable contribution to the science of numismatics, Num. Notes and Mons. No. 78, 1937, a second edition and enlargement of his former monograph, A Bibliography of Greek Coin Hoards, which appeared as No. I of the same series. The present edition lists eleven hundred and eighty-six hoards from practically every- where in the ancient world, includes Persia and India, and is the nearest to completeness yet at- tained. It is admirably indexed, by mints and rulers, geography, finding-dates, and authors. Since the modern science of numismatics de- pends so much upon the contents and dates of coin-hoards, this work of three hundred and sixty- two pages will be indispensable to the numisma- tist, and rounds out nicely the previous works on hoards that have appeared in the series. ITALY GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Egyptian Objects in Etruscan Tombs.-- W. FREIHERR VON BISSING discusses Egyptian statuettes and amulets found in Etruscan tombs. Entirely absent are objects having to do with the cult or mysteries of Osiris. Most common are the deities of Memphis, then Maet, goddess of truth and justice, the sphinx, the falcon, etc. Less frequent are the Theban divinities. Since Egyp- tian and Graeco-Egyptian objects are so numer- ous, the paucity of Asiatic monuments fails to indicate any commerce between Etruria and Asia Minor, which is surprising indeed if the Etruscans came shortly before the date of the tombs at Vetulonia and Narce. (Stud. e Mater. di Stor. d. Relig. xiii, 1937, pp. 1-9.) ROMAN GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Meta Romuli.-In Atti della Pontificia Acca- demia Romana di Archeologia, Rendiconti xii, 1936, pp. 21-63, B. M. PEEBLES, of the American Academy in Rome, writes of the so-called Meta, or Sepulcrum, Romuli and of its destruction by Pope Alexander VI in 1499, as described in a letter, hitherto unpublished, written in Latin by Michele Ferno to a certain Raffaele Maffei (called by him, Volaterranus). This pyramidal monument, rising from a base forty cubits square, with slightly concave sides, to a height of some forty or forty-five cubits, stood near the corner of Via Cornelia and Via Triumphalis in the Borgo of Rome, and as described in the letter of Ferno, was removed with considerable difficulty owing to its massive concrete structure (it was in ancient times covered with slabs of marble) in order to make way for a thoroughfare from the Castle of St. Angelo to the Papal Palace. In a somewhat truncated form it was used in late mediaeval times as a protective outpost for arch- ers in defense of the St. Angelo fortress. It con- tained, Ferno tells us, a sepulchral chamber and may have been the Pyramis in Vaticano referred to in the Pseudo-Acronian commentary to Horace as the "tomb of Scipio." The scholars of 1500 A.D. referred to it variously as Scipionis sepul- chrum, sepulchrum Epulonum, or, by the common people, as Romuli meta. The second of these names was probably due to a confusion with a similar monument near the Porta San Paolo, called the Pyramid of Gaius Cestius, VII Vir Epulonum, and supposed to contain the tomb of Remus or according to some accounts the remains of both Romulus and Remus. The letter is fully annotated and thirty-eight mediaeval pictures in which the meta is represented are classified and listed. Legionary Standards.- The fourth square in</page><page sequence="13">142 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY the upper part (attico) of the Arch of Constantine in Rome, which 'depicts the Suovetaurilia cele- brated by Marcus Aurelius after his victory over the Marcomanni, shows, in the second and third planes of the relief, which, in the lack of perspec- tive drawing, are indicated by an increased height of the figures, a fine display of seven legionary standards. ALFREDO MONACI in Atti della Ponti- ficia Accademia Romana di Archeologia, Rendi- conti xii, 1936, pp. 75-78, discusses the appur- tenance of these to various well-known legions of the time. The first belongs, he thinks, to the Pretorian Guard and shows the bust of the em- peror under a vexillum of quadrate form. The second is quite unusual in form: above an eagle, in profile toward the right, is seated a toga-clad divinity with a sceptre in his right hand; from the eagle's beak hangs a basket, containing the en- trails of sacrificial victims and on its front side is a portrait head. A modius-like headdress, Monaci thinks, comparing a Zeus-Serapis in the Capitoline Museum (Nuova descrizione, p. 90, No. 2, Stanza Terza detta del Sarcofago), proves that this was the standard of the third Cyrenaic legion, for the cult of the Serapid Jupiter of the lower world was widespread among the Egyptian legionaries and the emblems of most of the other legions are known to us, only those of the third Augusta, the fourth Scythica and the third Cyrenaica remain- ing unknown; the first two of these could not have taken part in this Danubian expedition of Aure- lius, narrowing the possibilities down to the third Cyrenaica. The history of this legion is then traced with references to the literature, thereto pertain- ing. Along with the twenty-second Deiotariana, the third Cyrenaica was the first to proclaim Vespasian emperor; at the siege of Jerusalem (70 A.D.) two thousand auxiliaries of this legion took part; in 116 (C.I.L. III, 13, 587) a vexillatio of this legion dedicated an epigram, still extant, "Jovi Optimo Maximo Serapidi"; in 120 it was transferred to Bostra (Claudius Ptolemaeus, FEcoypaqc&lt;il 'Yq)yl cr;i, V, 17, 5). The standards of the first Minervia, the fourteenth Gemina Martia Victrix and the twenty-second Primigenia with the eagle holding an acorn or crown are also mentioned. The two standards to the right, the author argues, may have been those of the twentieth Valeria Victrix and the thirtieth Ulpia Victrix. He refers the sculptures to the first phase of the Bellum Marcomannicum and would date them later than January 169 owing to the absence of Lucius Verus, and not later than 174, the date of the emperor's return, and perhaps not later than 172, if the prefect represented behind the emperor is Macrinius Vindex and not Bassaeus Rufus. An Altar at Ancient Carthage. - Ibid. pp. 157- 168, BIANCA MARIA MAJ describes an altar of quadrangular form found in 1916 in the Garden Saumagne on the slopes of the hill Byrsa at ancient Carthage. This has been named by Poinssot, who connects it with a little temple near it built by P. Perellius Haedulus, its sacerdos perpetuus, "Ara Gentis Augustae," the word gens being used in the sense of domus. On the two main faces are relief figures of Apollo and Roma, seated in similar attitudes at the right of the scene: Apollo, on a throne orna- mented with griffins, holds in his right hand a branch of laurel and in the left what is perhaps a plectron, for nearby is a lyre; in the free space at the left is a tripod. Roma is seated on a pile of armor, her right hand supporting a pilaster on which a flying Nike is placing a round shield; in front of her is an altar bearing the emblems of Augustan Rome, globe, caduceus and cornucopia. On one of the shorter sides of the altar a sacrifice is represented with Augustus officiating, while on the opposite short side Aeneas, as archegetes of the race is seen carrying Anchises on his shoulder and leading the boy Ascanius. Rostovtzeff assigns the altar to the years immediately following the death of Augustus and thinks of it as inspired by the intent to honor Tiberius by coupling him with his great predecessor. Poinssot, on the basis of a minute examination of the altar and its surround- ings, especially bricks bearing the name of Perel- lius Haedulus, fixes as a terminus post quem 27 B.c., when the senate dedicated to Augustus the clipeus aureus (Mon. Ancyr. 6-18) and as a terminus ante quem the death of Augustus. The altar is an adaptation of Greek traditions to a Hellenizing Rome. Maj lists a number of such altars and treats of parallels to these representations of Roma, Apollo and Aeneas. A ri6sumb of such deifications of Rome, dating back to the second century B.C. is given and Augustus' unwillingness to have temples and statues erected in his honor is commented on. ARCHITECTURE Problems connected with the Hippodrome.- In Byzantion xi, 1936, pp. 383-390, A. PIGANIOL discusses the Imperial loge in the Byzantine hip- podrome and the problem of the covered hippo-</page><page sequence="14">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 143 drome. At Rome the imperial loge was first erected under Domitian, as a dependance from the new Palatine palace. Suppressed by Trajan it was re-established later. It seems to have combined Augustus' pulvinar (on the ground level) with a screened cubiculum built above, for privacy. The creta may have been shifted from the carceres to the axis of this loge, and the editor would then simply sign, by dropping the mappa in his box over the carceres to the judges at the line. Malalas tells us that Constantine constructed the Byzantine imperial loge in imitation of the one at Rome. The lower floor, stama, contained the processional statue of the Tyche of the city and corresponded to the Roman pulvinar. But the "scratch" was at a distance from the stama. The position of the carceres, on the other hand, would require a long covered gallery encircling nearly one-fourth of the hippodrome, if the im- perial loge was over the carceres and the emperor went to it from the palace of Daphne. Such a passage is never mentioned in the most detailed palace itineraries. Again, Malalas speaks clearly of the emperor's loge facing the eastern side of the circus. This reference is to be taken with a passage in the Book of Ceremonies (Bonn Ed., Vol. I, p. 507), the itinerary of Theophilus, where the emperor is described as passing (on horseback) through the uncovered hippodrome, under the cathisma, then by way of the palace of Daphne, finally by the covered hippodrome (alighting from his horse) and by the Skyla (into the palace). This shows that the cathisma was not over the carceres but between the hippodrome and the palace, as has been demonstrated by the Abbe' Vogt. Ebersolt admits the existence of two distinct regions in the great hippodrome: a covered and an uncovered hippodrome; but then it is impos- sible to pass from one to the other by going up the cathisma. Vogt regarded the covered one as part of the imperial palace. He could have presented his interpretation with much more assurance if he had observed that at Rome, between the palace of Domitian and that of Severus, there still stand considerable remains of a small hippodrome surrounded by a covered peristyle. Byzantinists would profit by comparing the palace plans of Constantinople with those of Rome; and, by ricochet, some uncertainties of the Roman ar- rangement might also be clarified. The parallelism is surprising. In each city the palace is east of the hippodrome; the principle entrance at the north. The palace at Rome, called that of Domitian, has, in east to west order, three chief halls: aula regis, the peristyle Sicilia, triclinium; these cor- respond in the Daphne palace at Constantinople to the consistory, Augusteus (?), and the triclinos (sic) of nineteen couches. The Byzantine imperial loge was vaster than the Roman, but like it to the north. Even the sacred well to the southwest of S. Sophia may be compared to the ancient well south of the temple of Cybele and which may really be the mundus of the city of Romulus. Further interesting parallels of temples and churches in the two cities are suggested. Ebersolt would have done well not to omit Rome when he was studying Spalato and Ravenna in an effort to picture the vanished palaces of Byzantium. The Palatine has furnished an evident solution of the covered hippodrome, which obliges us to correct all plans hitherto prepared of the palaces of Byzantium. SCULPTURE Aphrodisias.-During the past season excava- tions were begun by the Italian Archaeological Mission in Anatolia at the site of ancient Aphro- disias. Important discoveries were made almost immediately. They are described briefly by the Director of the Expedition, Professor GIULIO JACOPI, in I.L.N., December 18, 1937, pp. 1095- 1097. The remains of a large marble portico of Ionian style were partially cleared. The building probably served as the agora of the ancient city. So far about one hundred meters of the epistyle, frieze and cornice have been found. An inscription on the epistyle shows that the building was ded- icated to Aphrodite, members of the Imperial House, Augustus, Tiberius and Livia, and the Roman People. The frieze is decorated with a continuous series of sculptured heads, joined by festoons. One hundred and forty heads have been discovered, representing divinities, mythological characters, and portraits. They form an excep- tionally important series of sculpture of the Augustan-Tiberian age. Masons' marks are cut in both Greek and Latin letters, indicating that the sculptors were both Greek and Roman, a pertinent fact in any discussion of the nationality of sculptors of the Roman period. Bronze Head in Florence. - In La Critica d'Arte ii, 1937, pp. 49-54, A. MINTO publishes a bronze head in the Museo Archeologico in Flor- ence. The head, which once belonged to a heroic statue of a Roman emperor of the middle third century, has been identified as a portrait of C.</page><page sequence="15">144 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Vibius Trebonianus Gallus. In spite of technical differences, it bears a striking resemblance to the portrait in the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the portrait in the Museo delle Antichita in Istanbul, the head of a statue in the Museo Gregoriano in the Vatican, and medallions of Trebonianus Gallus in Florence. Constantinian Consoles. - The Basilica of Max- entius was perhaps completed by that ruler; it was then modified, chiefly by the construction of an apse on the north side. Unlike the rest of the basilica, this apse was richly adorned with niches, decorative columns and pilasters, etc. There were ten consoles, of which eight are still in place. The top of each console has about the same measure- ments as the back. The canal on the side does not continue into the "volute," which is a small circle containing a rosette. The field on the side is occupied by a half-palmette or by acanthus; the latter is of an eastern type. On the front of each console is a Victory, moving to right or left. In style and technique there are marked similarities to ornament at Spalato. The Victories are closely allied also to the west and south friezes of the Arch of Constantine; the same men must have worked on both:; the north apse is thereby dated soon after the capture of Rome by Constantine in 312. Fourteen other consoles were built in the eleventh century into the "Casa di Rienzo" in Rome. Despite some differences in size and style, all probably belonged to one Roman building. There were probably four others; the eighteen would be symmetrically placed. Two had Vic- tories on the front; two, putti with hares; two, moving putti; two, groups of Cupid and Psyche; four, garland-carriers; two, mourning Cupids; two, boys with staffs; and two, putti with baskets. The consoles differ considerably in details, and as a group they differ from those of the basilica, particularly in the freer use of the drill; but the general type is the same, and comparison with the friezes of the Arch of Constantine places the Rienzo consoles also between 310 and 315. The two groups of consoles were made by two groups of workmen, not unrelated. Another console of the same type was in the Villa Rospigliosi; it probably came from a villa of Maxentius. Probably the sculptors went to Rome after working at Spalato. (H. KAHLER, Jb. Arch. I. li, 1936, pp. 180-201.) Sculptures of the Arch of Constantine.- In the army of Constantine, African Moors are recog- nizable by the arrows in their headdresses; they appear on many monuments of the third and fourth centuries A.D. Gallo-German troops are recognizable by their horned helmets and the devices on their shields. Much of the sculpture of the arch reflects traditional Roman religious ideas; but the raised right hand of Sol Invictus is oriental, and the same gesture in Constantine himself is evidence of an oriental identification of emperor and Sun. (H. P. L'ORANGE, Arch. Anz. 1936, cols. 595-607.) INSCRIPTIONS Fasti Ostienses.-In Atti della Pontificia Ac- cademia Romana di Archeologia, Rendiconti xii, 1936, pp. 179-184, ATTILIO DEGRASSI discusses the light cast on the two Dacian wars of the em- peror Trajan by the Fasti Ostienses, found in the excavations carried on in recent years by Guido Calza at Ostia. Of the twenty years of Trajan's reign, the chronicles of twelve, 101-103, 107-113 and 115-116 A.D., are now extant. The relation of the last of these periods to the Parthian war, Degrassi has already discussed in the Congresso di Studi Romani, and he here treats of the fasti of the years 101-103 and 107-109, in their relation to the Dacian wars. He proposes as a substitute for Weickert's emendation of C.I.L. XIV, 4538 et addit. (p. 773) 11.1-2, [Imp. Traianus Aug.] vocavit [regem Decebalum ad] tribuna [1 suum], which he regards as rather inept and incon- sistent with the added fragment in the C.I.L., the reading [Decebalus, rex Dacorum, in] vocavit [fidem] (or some such word) . .. [veniam ante] tribuna [1 precat] us est, and compares Dio Cas- sius, LXVIII, 9, 6: (Decebalus) &amp;KCOV p0oX06yrlo  Trp6S T-r "-rv Tpacavyvv Eo?(ohcAv Kat yfiv TrEaocAV KCit "JrrpoOKTVvOCas O a V KaC Tr 6TArrXo 6&amp;rroppiyas, (a scene which is represented on the Trajan column). The third line, de Dacis [triump] havit, confirms what we already knew about Trajan's first triumph over the Dacians in 102 and the omission of any mention of the games held in honor of this victory, which were probably recorded in the (defective) fasti of the next year, leads the author to think that this triumph took place in the last half of December, 102 A.D. As to the second Dacian war, we learn from the inscription on the base of the statue which Athens dedicated to Hadrian during his archonship in 11~2-113, that he had served prior to this time as praetor and as legatus of the legion first Minervia during the second Dacian war and then as legatus Augusti pro praetore in Pannonia and at a later</page><page sequence="16">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 145 date had been made con ul. Mommsen, on the supposition that Aelius Spartianus (Scriptores hist. Augustae, Hadr, 3, 8) had confused the consuls Suranus bis and Servianus iterum (102 A.D.) with Suranus III and Senecio II (107 A.D.), would date this praetorship in the year 107 and the consulship in 109 (his praetorship in 102 is impossible, for he was made tribune only in 105), and would regard the war as lasting three years, from early in 105 to the fall of 107. That it ended in autumn is shown by the reaping scenes on the Column of Trajan. Degrassi, on the basis of com- binations drawn from the fasti C.I.L. XIV, 4539, which show that Hadrian was made consul in 108, and references to a congiarium (donative) on the 26th of May, 107 (or the 25th of June: Iu[nias or Iu[lias), thinks that Hadrian was sent to Rome by Trajan to oversee the triumphal gladiatorial contests (munus) at the close of the war in 106, while he himself stayed on to settle affairs in Dacia, where he was later joined by Hadrian. From the fact that a so-called second munus of one hundred and seventeen days (or 123) and one thousand gladiators, extending over the period from June 4, 108, to November 1, 109, is men- tioned (cf. Dio Cassius LXVIII, 15, 1), Degrassi is convinced that the primum or prius munus must have been the one managed by Hadrian, to whom Trajan had given two million sesterces to meet its expense. The three congiaria, of which we know, must have been then: one, at the beginning of his reign in 99 A.D., a second at the close of the first Dacian war in 102, and a third early in 107, a month or two after the close of the second war in 106. This probably amounted to five hundred denarii per man, the munificence of which was un- doubtedly due to the rich spoils captured in Dacia. BULGARIA A New Monument of the Thracian Horseman. -The first relief discussed in this article (R. Arch. x, 1937, pp. 39-42) was found in 1936 at Kaia-Bouroun, Bulgaria, and is now in the Museum of the Library of Tatar-Pazardjik. Its value lies in the additional material which it provides for the study of the iconography of the Thracian Horseman. The remaining fragment of this document consists of the left side of a marble slab, 19.5 cm. in height, 18 cm. wide, and 4.5 cm. thick, with Greek letters 1.5-2 cm. in height on the plinth. The essential details of the relief are: the hind legs of a horse galloping to the right; the right foot of the horseman; a dog jumping to the right behind the horse's legs; and beneath the horse, the figure of a man (whose head is missing) clothed in a short tunic and raising his right arm. The Greek inscription is: Q(AX&amp;dpos) Aivis 6 Kai 'Hppi (sic) E[VXcaptcr]T1fplov. Should this relief be included among those des- ignated by the name Thraco-Mithraic, where one sees the figure of a recumbent man under the feet of a horse; or should it be related to the funerary stelae of Noricum, of Dalmatia, of Pannonia, etc., which show a Roman horseman trampling on a fallen enemy? Since we know that the former influenced to some degree the mode of rep- resenting the Thracian Horseman, it is possible that the same influence is to be seen in this relief. It is instructive to consider in this connection the lower fragment of a group of the Thracian Horseman which was found in the sanctuary of this divinity at Dinicly. Its essential details are: on the left, a human foot, probably that of the slave who, in numerous Thracian reliefs, follows the horse and holds on to the horse's tail; in relief on the pillar joining the base to the horse's body, the figure of a man kneeling to the right with his hands (probably bound) behind his back; on the right, a wild boar run down by a dog. The in- scription on the base is: eEo( 'Aw6r6Xcovt A0pihA~s MapKlcav6 -Tp-rT1cbTT-r rpactrcopitav6g FEKEIr~tJV EcXaptorflptca. This group, just as the aforementioned relief, is obviously intended to represent an enemy beaten down by the Horseman, In the numerous reliefs, however, which are identified as being characteristically Thracian, the Hero Horseman is never shown fighting against men but only against animals. It is probable, therefore, that both the reliefs under discussion reflect the influ- ence of the Thraco-Mithraic reliefs. Mezek: Thrace. -In Antiquity xi, 43, 1937, pp. 300-305, FILov describes the beehive tombs on this site. The article, apparently a synopsis of a more detailed one which will appear shortly in Bulletin de l'Institut Archdologique Bulgare, de- scribes briefly the tombs which are dated in the fourth century B.c. Filov points out that these Thracian tombs obviously are not imitations of contemporary Greek tombs but represent an older native tradition in which there are possibly Mycenaean influences. YUGOSLAVIA Neolithic Sites in the Yugoslav Portion of the Lower Danube Valley. - In Proceedings American</page><page sequence="17">146 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Philosophical Society lxxviii, 1937, pp. 329 ff., VLADIMIR J. FEWKES deals with the little known south bank of the Danube between the Iron Gate and the river Timok (Yugoslavian-Bulgarian border). Owing to natural erosion the bank is exposed along a more or less vertical section facing the river, and archaeological deposits are thereby brought to view. The publication is based on field investigations during which general reconnais- sance was pursued on a score of sites. Among these sites are five extensive settlements, all revealing instructive deposits in situ, and containing rich cultural remains. At most of the other sites, which date from the Bronze Age (Vatin) and often also from later times, at least some Neolithic sherds were found on the surface, but no correspondingly datable deposits were seen in the exposed profiles. The question of possible Neolithic occupation in such instances depends on future excavations. The observations thus far made in the Yugoslav portion of the lower Danube valley are suggestive, but only provisionally so, for it would be difficult to draw conclusions until dependable digging justifies them. It is evident, however, that Neolithic occupation, especially in the riparian zone, was centered in large communities, and that controlled economy (agriculture, animal hus- bandry) under sessile conditions prevailed. The Neolithic material remains comprise varieties characteristic of the western half of the lower Danube valley at large. The most common, and perhaps the oldest, class of ceramics is the barbotine ware, invariably found in stratigraph- ically lowest deposits. This pottery compares very closely with similar material from Starievo and Vin'a (middle Danube) and from a series of sites in Bulgaria and Roumania (lower Danube). Owing to the lack of adequate data, a general synthesis of the Neolithic culture history in the lower Danubian valley is not yet attainable; however, certain geographical differentiation is perceivable. The Boian development appears to be localized more or less in the central portion of the valley, namely in Greater Wallachia and in north-central Bulgaria. The cultural expression in the western periphery seems more in line with the Moravo-Danubian area (cf. A.J.A. xli, 1937, pp. 329-330) and the Banat, i.e., with the middle Danube valley. It is generally agreed that the Boian manifestations represent an advanced stage of development. Despite certain suggestive leads, however, the question of a genetic relationship between the Boian ceramic style and the barbo- tine ware of the primary phase, remains open. The author points out that the Iron Gate ap- pears not to have been penetrated in pre-Roman times. The distribution of Neolithic settlements suggests that the difficult gorge was circumvented by following Danubian tributaries on either side of the river. This seems to be true of other pre- historic periods as well, for there is no positive evidence to show that the Iron Gate accommo- dated cultural traffic until the time of Trajan's campaigns. The article is accompanied by an appendix on a microscopic study of samples of barbotine sherds by D. Horton, who shows that the positive applique is of the same material as that used in the construction of the vessels themselves. In other words there are no qualitative differences between the body of the wall and the additional coating; this applique, then, is not tantamount to a slip. U.S.S.R. Recent Archaeological Discoveries Throughout the Soviet Union.- (Notes received in private communications or extracted from Soviet publi- cations in the library of the Field Museum.) Siberia.-1. A. P. OKLADNIKOV found an Up- per Palaeolithic site at Nizhniaia Buret village near Irkutsk on the Angara River. The most im- portant object was a female figurine, similar to those from Malta, carved out of mammoth ivory. 2. B. E. PETRI discovered a Palaeolithic site in the Berezov Mountains at the watershed of the Lena and Angara Rivers. Here on the first terrace of the Kuda River was disclosed a culture at- tributed to the late Aurignacian or early Solutrian periods. Crude scrapers of convex, concave, straight, triangular, lingulate and carinate forms were found, as well as knife-shaped laminae, nuclei, knives, primitive axes (Armchenbeile) and drills. During the summer of 1936 Petri found another site near Rogatka on Lake Baikal. Petri lists the Stone Age periods represented at the following sites of eastern Siberia: Neolithic (1) Upper at Ulan Khada I and II, Koty, Pesch- annaia, Sukhovskaia, and Rogatka I. (2) Middle at Ulan Khada IX-III. (3) Lower at Ulan Khada XI-X, Tsar Devitsa II, and Rogatka II and III. Palaeolithic: (1) Upper Magdalenian at Verk- holenskaia Gora, Ushkanka and BadaT Selenga. (2) Upper Aurignacian at Bozol, Pereselenchen- skil Punkt. (3) Middle Aurignacian at Malta. In Petri's excavations can be traced the transi-</page><page sequence="18">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 147 tion from Palaeolithic to Lower Neolithic depos- its where there were neither arrowheads, nor pottery, nor polished implements. In this cultural phase which he calls "Pre-ceramic Neolithic" there were two thousand specimens, many typi- cally Palaeolithic, but the majority were Neolithic and included slate fish-hooks, flint drills, chisels, etc. The most important objects were stone axes. In eastern Siberian Neolithic stations, polished axes and those with lug-like projections are characteristic, but at Rogatka were excavated flaked axes of the latter type in a Lower Palaeo- lithic deposit. This is the initial stage of the Baikal axes. 3. During 1929 and 1932 S. KISELEV (Sovetskaia Arkheologiia, ii, 1937, pp. 71-94) excavated near the villages of Syda and Tessi several Bronze Age burials on the first terrace above the flood-level attributed to the middle Yenissei culture and belonging to the so-called Afanasievo type of the third millennium B.c. The tumuli were surrounded by a circle of flag-stones, which Kiselev considers to be a sun-symbol, prototype of cromlechs. From one to eight individuals, each in a flexed position, occurred in the burials. Metal objects were rare. There were some deer antlers, unusual types of pottery, including ovoid and spherical jars, the majority with round bases decorated with a denticulate instrument. Similar burials have been found in the Altai. EUROPEAN RUSSIA V. A. GORODTSOV (Sovetskaia Arkheologiia ii, 1937, p. 150) describes the treasure of Pod- cherema, located on the Pechora River in the western foothills of the northern Ural Mountains. The jewelry, stored in the Hermitage since 1929, consists of bronze pendants, little bells and small chains. Bronze representations of divinities or of sacred animals, symbolic plaques and pendants in the form of winged discs and of mythical animals may well have served for ritualistic ceremonies. The cult objects are of exceptional interest, since they bear witness to a clear syncretism of local and Persian religious concept. The most interest- ing of the latter category are the winged discs, sometimes supported by birds, sometimes by grapes. The former antedate the Persian repre- sentation of the deified winged sun. The latter, by their affinity with the southern group, indicate the general direction from which these motifs have come, an affinity shared by the effigies of kings, queens, and hereditary princes, figures on Sasanian coins with the hairdressing in the form of birds and animals. The possessors of the Pod- cherema treasure were represented with the hair dressed in the same manner as the principal god, the goddess, his wife and divine heir, their son. Gorodtsov dates this treasure at the beginning of the fourth century A.D., which coincides approxi- mately with the reign of the Sasanian king Hor- musdas (303-309). The treasury reflects many characters of its masters, who practiced the culti- vation of plants, the domestication of animals, various kinds of hunting and primitive industry, in particular metallurgy. North Caucasus.-B. B. PIOTROVSKI (" Aegyp- tische Altertiimer im nord-kaukasischen Gebiet," Kruzhok po izucheniiu Drevnego Vostoka pri Gosudarstvennom Ermitazhe, Sbornik, No. 2 (9), Leningrad, 1935, pp. 35-49) describes Egyptian antiquities in local museums. He states that the majority of the objects, which belong to the be- ginning of the Christian era, are important for dating the Hellenistic import trade but not as evidence of any direct relationship between Egypt and the Caucasus. Transcaucasia.-1. S. N. ZAMIATNIN of the Institute of Anthropology and Ethnology (IAE) reports the discovery of about fifty Palaeolithic stations on the Caucasian Coast of the Black Sea. These sites, which are usually connected with early alluvial deposits of the ancient terraces, con- tain implements of Acheulian, Levalloisian, Mousterian and Upper Palaeolithic types. During 1936 Zamiatnin, who excavated caves near Adler, found an Upper Palaeolithic stratum and three levels of Mousterian hearths in Navalishin cave in the gorge of the Kudepsta River. In a cave near the Mzymta River and opposite Akhshtyr' village two Mousterian horizons were found. The bone deposits in each cave belonged for the most part to Ursus spelaeus. GEORGIA A. N. KALANDADZE discovered the first Tardenoisian site with typical trapezoidal micro- liths close to Odishi village near Zugdidi. ENGLAND Crambeck, Yorkshire. - In Antiquaries Journal xvii, 1937, pp. 392-413, PHILIP CORDER and MARGARET BIRLEY report on two fourth-century pottery kilns and the distribution of the ware made here. The kilns are near to and identical with those described in Corder's "Roman Pottery</page><page sequence="19">148 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY at Crambeck, Castle Howard, 1928." The article contains a list of type forms that are found at Crambeck, Signal Station, Malton, Langton and Birdoswald. The kilns are dated to the last thirty years of the fourth century, to the time when Count Theodosius re-organized the northern defences of the province. Malden Castle, Dorset.-In Antiquaries Jour- nal xvii, 1937, pp. 261-282, R. F. M. WHEELER reports on the third season's work on this site. The site was occupied from Neolithic times to the reign of Vespasian. After a long break it was again occupied in the fourth century from which century comes much New Forest pottery, a Romano-Celtic temple, priests' house, and a hut. Worth, Kent.-Ibid., pp. 310-313, W. P. D. STEBBING reports on some pre-Roman, Roman, and post-Roman pottery from this site. BYZANTINE AND MEDIAEVAL Seals of the Emperor Leo III.-In Byzantion xi, 1936, pp. 469-482, N. LIHACEV (posthumously) studies seals of the Emperor Leo III, the Isaurian. Among the lead seals of the iconoclastic prince, one of special interest bears the figure of the Virgin and is of the earliest days of the reign, 717-720, before the iconoclastic movement. This Virgin Hodegetria is of an extremely interesting type, holding the Savior straight before her in both arms, and presenting him not as a child but as Emmanuel blessing the world. The type seems to have come out of Palestine or Egypt. Similar representations are to be seen in Cyprus in the mosaic of Kition (Church of Panagia Angelokis- tos), and in the Codex Raboula of 586. In the ninth century the image passed to the seals of the patriarchs of Constantinople. There were three types of seals of Leo III of which the "iconoclas- tic," presenting the figure only of the sovereign, is the most recent. Mediaeval Constantinople.-In Atti della Pon- tificia Accademia Romana di Archeologia, Rendi- conti xii, 1936, pp. 133-156, SILvIO GIUSEPPE MERCATI, after discussing a number of manu- scripts and treatises which describe the sanc- tuaries (a term that was applied not only to the churches themselves but to the chests and closets in which sacred relics were guarded) and remains of saints which had been brought back to Con- stantinople from Jerusalem, Asia Minor, the islands and various parts of the Roman empire in order to preserve them from the hands of the infidels, treats of the Codex Ottobonianus Latinus 169, which, bound up with other documents, lists and describes the holy relics of Constantinople, extant up to the time of the Latin conquest in 1204 A.D., and records many marvelous miracles wrought by them. He gives the Latin text in full and thinks it was written by some English friar who visited the east in the twelfth century. Among these relics were pieces of the holy cross, the swaddling clothes and other garments of Christ, the crown of thorns, the basin in which Jesus washed the feet of his disciples, the vinegar sponge, the Veronica handkerchief, the garments of the Virgin Mary, the rod of Moses, etc. At the end the churches of Constantinople are catalogued and a short description of Jerusalem is appended. Mediaeval Sculpture of Campania. - Ibid., pp. 81-104, W. F. VOLBACH treats of the mediaeval sculpture of Campania. The grand epoch of this art did not begin until the second half of the eleventh century, in the time of Desiderio, Abbot of Montecassino, and under the Norman dynasty. Before that time only scant remains of old Chris- tian art are to be found, such as, for example, in the catacombs of Naples, in the church of St. Gennaro extra moenia, and on certain Christian sarcophagi. In these we see a decided oriental influence in their vegetal and other ornamenta- tion and in the griffins, monsters and animals represented. This seems to have been exerted chiefly through the importation from Byzantine, Persian and other eastern markets of textiles such as rugs, carpets, tapestries and woven fabrics generally. Under this influence plasticity became flattened out into purely linear ornamentation almost on one plane, probably not at all influenced by Gothic or Lombard art. When in the eleventh century a new awakening came, this was once more due to a strong current of Byzantine culture, brought in by refugees from the iconoclast perse- cutions under Leo, the Isaurian, and reinforced by Moslem art from Asia Minor, Palestine and Egypt. This stream of influence came into Campania by way of Puglia and Sicily where the Normans had officially adopted Byzantine politics and culture and had greatly encouraged all kinds of importations from Byzantium and the east. Volbach gives many illustrations of Christian works of art from the eleventh and twelfth cen- turies, including three pictures of Jonah in the mouth of the whale, and several that evidence a renascence of classical or Roman art. Praetoriumat Jerusalem. -Additional evidence that the Antonia marks the site of the Praetorium</page><page sequence="20">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 149 where Jesus was condemned to death is furnished by recent examination of the strange cistern underneath the Basilica of the Ecce Homo. Re- moval of several layers of water-proof coating from the walls of the cistern disclosed the fact that it was originally a double chambered tomb of the Hasmonean type. The original entrance of the tomb was also found, proving that the great breach in the south wall of each chamber was not a part of the original plan. When the masonry which now fills these breaches was cleared away and a careful examination of the breaches them- selves made, it was seen that they were well-worn entrances which had once been closed by heavy gates. The old Hasmonean tomb had been in- corporated into the plan of the Antonia and used as a guard-house at the western entrance. It would be here that the Roman soldiers made sport of Jesus. On the pavement nearby are out- lines of games which the soldiers used to play. (P1'RE VINCENT, Rev.

The new Director, Dr. Wrede, opened the meeting and introduced the speaker, Mr. Roland Hampe. On the slope of the Hill of Kronos between the Treasuries and the Stadion, the new excavations have uncovered the quarter of the bronze found- ers. In prehistoric times this had been the bed of a torrent carrying off the water from the hill be- hind. Later, when the Stadion was built, the ra- vine was filled with sand and it was chosen as a suitable location for the bronze foundries, the sand being used for making the moulds for the casting of large statues. Several of these installa- tions with their furnaces and moulds have been found, one of them sufficiently well preserved to show the technical processes in use at that time. Many votive offerings from the Heraion were un- covered where they had been discarded to make room for newer ones. A very fine bronze statuette of a runner, poised for the start of a race, should be mentioned, as well as a miniature jumping weight dedicated by a Lacedaemonian victor in the pentathlon, an early Corinthian helmet of the seventh century and many ornaments in thin bronze intended as decorations for the wooden shields of the warriors. These represent heraldic animals, mythological scenes or Victories. These shield devices have been found in other places in Greece as well as at Olympia, but they were so fragile that they had usually crumbled to pieces at the first touch. Now, however, the experts of the German Institute have discovered a process of preserving these thin plates of bronze by the use of melted wax and a backing of light canvas. An archaic female head in terracotta, probably from an akroterion, is considered by Mr. Hampe to have come from the Treasury of Gela, as the only close parallel for the type of face is found on a painted vase from Gela. During the summer of 1937 there was accom- plished the final work of setting up the Lion of Amphipolis.' He now stands 5.40 m. high on a modern pedestal which is another 5.00 m. in height (Fig. 1). The excavation of the site has shown that in antiquity the lion was placed in the - A.J.A. xli, 1937, News Items, p. 333. centre of a larger monument than it has been pbssible to reproduce today-obviously a poly- andrion commemorating some victory which so far it has been impossible to identify or date. On stylistic grounds the lion has been placed about the middle of the fourth century and would thus be somewhat earlier than the Lion of Chaeronea, which was erected after the battle of 338 B.c. The two lions are quite different in type, that of Amphipolis being of a more solid and compact build and giving an impression of greater realism and truth to nature (Figs. 2 and 3). On December 30th the Academy of Athens held its annual session to consider the work accom- plished during the year. The Secretary-General, Mr. Oikonomos, in summing up mentioned the progress made in regard to the excavations at the Academy of Plato, a very important step being the decision of the National Government to recognize the site as an archaeological zone and to make a generous annual contribution to the con- tinuance of the work. The machinery for the evaluation and expropriation of the property has been set in motion and Mr. Aristophron hopes to resume the actual digging in the early summer. The Society of the Friends of the National Museum held a meeting on the 5th of January in the Mycenaean Room of the Museum in order to present to the Director eight new cases for the better exhibition of individual objects such as the gold cups from the Fourth and Fifth Shaft Graves, and also to present to the collection a gold My- cenaean sword hilt bought from the funds of the Society. The sword hilt is in repouss6 work and is similar to two from Shaft Graves IV and V.2 After the presentation had been made, Mr. Marinatos, the new Director of the Department of Antiquities, gave a short talk on the evolution of Mycenaean art and its connection with the Minoan. He discussed particularly the art of sword-making, which was more developed at Mycenae than in Crete, owing to the warlike nature of the people, whereas in Crete the only sword which goes back as far as 2100-2000 B.c. is a very elaborate one, which in Mr. Marinatos' opinion was intended for use only on cult occa- sions by the King. Sword-making did, however, 2 See Karo, Die Schachtgrdber von Mykenai, pls.

The hilt presented to the Museum is considered by Mr. Marinatos to come from the sixteenth century B.c. and obviously belonged to royalty or to a personage of high standing. It also appears prob- able that the discoverers of the sword hilt must have found it with other objects of equal value, since a royal burial would have had a complete outfit of weapons, vases and articles of personal adornment. No trace of them has so far appeared. On January 14th the first Open Meeting of the American School was held in the Gennadeion. The Director, Mr. Morgan, described the 1937 excavations at Corinth. The work carried out during the spring months of last year has already been reported in the News Items.1 At that time the life-size statue of Athena was found, during the course of the demolition of the Church of St. John's (Fig. 4) and also the gold rings, earrings and bronze spits (Fig. 5) which came from one of the Geometric Graves in the south central section of the Agora. The starting lines for the fourth century and Hellenistic race tracks (Fig. 6) were also uncovered last spring. The excavations were resumed again on September 13th and continued until the eleventh of December. "In the north central area of the Agora a nar- row strip of land directly north of the Bema was excavated. A considerable extent of the Roman Agora has been laid bare, and numerous archi- tectural members from the Bema and adjacent structures have been recovered. Much of the marble pavement is preserved. When the whole area in front of the Central Shops and the Bema has been cleared, there will be an unobstructed view of the Agora from the Lechaion Road and the Propylaia." In clearing the area to the north of the Bema, a complex of mediaeval buildings was discovered. "This appears to have been a series of shops fronting upon a broad square. Thus we have evidence for the continuation of the Agora site as a civic centre at least as late as the thirteenth century. The earlier walls in the region continue to contain many blocks from the nearby Roman buildings. "A very thick layer of burned material covered the Roman marble pavement, which is still pre- served in places. This layer was filled with small fragments of marble, relating to the West Waiting Room, and among them was part of a Greek inscription. Other pieces of inscriptions have 1 A.J.A. xli, 1937, News Items, pp. 480-481. turned up in this section, the most interesting being the whole left side of a large stele erected in honor of a certain A. Arr(ius), listing his titles, which are numerous: Augur, Priest of Neptune, Duumvir, etc. More interesting are the dedicators, the Hieromnemones, whose title occurs rarely at Corinth. "The removal of the numerous Byzantine walls in the eastern part of the area produced a quantity of marble step and stylobate blocks from the Bema, many of which will shortly be restored to their original positions. With these was found an interesting fragment of sculpture representing Eros perched upon the left shoulder of a man. Many unusual pieces of Byzantine pottery were also recovered, the most striking of which is a plastic handle from a large cover of tenth-century date, representing a gnome-like man with pointed cap and beard, squatting on the ground. "A large poros foundation, partly uncovered in the early excavations of the northern part of the agora, was completely cleared. It measures 8.50 metres square, and is built of large rectangular blocks, not very carefully fitted together. Despite the manifest weight of the structure, it consists of a single course of stone, so that the suggestion that it may have supported the great statue of Athena, which Pausanias remarked as standing in the Market Place, seems at present untenable. Investigations to be undertaken in the spring will determine whether solid foundations exist under the central portion. The position of this structure, placed on the axis of the Bema and some seven- teen metres north of it, connotes a purpose of some importance. One peculiar feature consists of four post holes, cut in the upper surface of the structure, the two central ones about 1.20 metres apart, and the outer ones separated from the inner by a space of about 1.60 metres. They are located 1.80 metres from the southern edge of the founda- tion. Just to the east of this we cleared a trench dug during the campaign of 1905 to reveal a small water-channel running east and west. "The most interesting development in the area was the excavation of one of the large manholes of Peirene, G of the system. The steep staircase cut out of stereo and limestone was preserved at the top and bottom, but had been destroyed in the middle, early in Byzantine times, and its place taken by a well and a square manhole, built up on the sides with many large pieces of the Bema, including parts of the heavy marble stylobate and of the cornice, which has a beauti-</page><page sequence="25">FIG. 6.--AGORA NORTHEAST.

Some inscribed frag- ments were found, the most interesting of these being a base erected in honor of a certain Gaius Heius Aristos, by decree of the local senate. His titles include that of Duumvir, thus adding his name to the list of these magistrates, and pointing again to the prominence of this family, two other members of which held the same title about the time of Augustus. Two fine pieces of sculpture were also found here, a delicately modelled head of a woman in relief, about two-thirds life-size, and a large fragment of a statue base, the esti- mated diameter of which is about a metre. Above a low torus moulding are carved confused groups of the spoils of war, shields, cuirasses, and greaves. On one of these heaps a woman is sitting in a de- jected attitude. "A section across the west end of the South Stoa ca. 15 metres wide, including three shops and three storerooms, has been cleared this season. A late Roman bath with well preserved hypocausts occupies the southernmost part of this area. Two of the rooms with hypocausts have apsidal ends on the south side. To the west of the baths the original Greek shops are better preserved. The partition wall between storerooms XXVII and XXVIII is standing to a height of over two and a half metres. It seems likely that this portion of the Stoa continued to be devoted to its original use throughout the classical period, whereas most of the shops farther east were demolished in Roman times to make room for various administrative buildings. "Several pieces of inscriptions have been dis- covered, including a fragment which seems to date from the early second century B.C. It has to do with some regulations governing the activities of certain artisans. The most important piece of sculpture is a statuette of Pan seated on a rock. It is entirely preserved with the exception of the two hands by which he held the pipes to his mouth. The marble is broken at the beard in such a way as to indicate that the god was represented in the act of playing the pipes. "Two large Byzantine tombs were discovered in this section. Both contained a number of skeletons, and one had bronze and silver jewelry, glass beads, and a considerable amount of cloth preserved on the bodies. Another large tomb of earlier date was the grave of five Avar soldiers. Each wore a buckle, two had knives at their waists, and many iron weapons were lying about them. A deposit of unusually fine Roman pottery and glass of the first century A.D. was discovered in a drain in the southern part of the area." In the south central region of the Agora the clearing was continued down to the level of the fourth-century Greek cobblestone pavements. "A large stretch of this pavement about in the centre of the southern half of the Agora has been exposed. The removal of mediaeval walls pro- duced numerous blocks from the South Stoa, in- cluding many pieces of the large gutter which ran along in front of the stereobate. An interesting find is a large broken block of marble, which seems to be the lower part of one of the curious supports associated with the Bema, representing gigantic figures in relief against a half acanthus column. Though badly damaged, the heel of the giant and a good section of the acanthus decora- tion may be distinguished. "Abundant fragmentary mediaeval pottery of all periods from the tenth to the thirteenth cen- tury was found. This includes the larger part of an incised plate of the early thirteenth century with a lion crushing a deer, a deposit of unusual pieces of Proto-Majolica (Fig. 7, p. 152) and a sgrafito sherd bearing a fragmentary inscription in several lines. A well is producing fragments of Green-and- Brown Painted vessels, with a few coins. "Coins from this area are not so numerous as from the Agora north-central section, but a 'pocket' of 86 coins dating apparently from the tenth century is of interest. Over part of the area a thick deposit of ash filled with glass fragments, dating probably from the thirteenth century, is of considerable importance, for it indicates the existence of a glass factory not far from one found last spring in the Agora Northeast area, of about the same date. A very fine glass bottle, nearly complete, with enamelled designs representing birds, was found near this deposit. Among the small finds was a remarkably fine carnelian gem, representing a nude warrior seated before a statue of Athena. It dates from the early Roman period and is of exquisite workmanship. "The large manhole leading into a cross branch of the Peirene system was dug almost to the floor of the channel. It is of great size, measuring four metres in length by one in breadth, with a short passage connecting with a well at a high level, and a second spur about half way down, which runs southward for a very short distance and then stops. All the fill was mediaeval, apparently of tenth-century date, and contained several</page><page sequence="27">156 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY complete specimens of impressed pottery in the shape of 'fruit stands,' with a broad, rather flat upper surface, and a high moulded foot. "A considerable section of the south wall of the Central Shops was uncovered near the north- ern limit of the area. While the final clearing of the chambers must wait until the spring campaign, it is now apparent that the western shops of this series extended 1.70 metres farther south than those to the east, a difference which did not affect their external appearance, nor destroy the regu- larity of their facades. "During the process of constructing a distillery opposite the railway station at Hexamilia, work- men discovered the presence of a small Roman chamber tomb. Under the supervision of Dr. G. R. Davidson, this was cleared with the most interest- ing results. The vaulted concrete roof had col- lapsed, but the rest of the tomb, of rectangular plan, was in good condition. Eleven arched niches occupied the walls, and bedded in the floor of each was a cylindrical urn for the ashes of the dead, covered with a convex lid. A stone sarcophagus was placed on the earthen floor at the northwest corner, extending to the east. The walls were neatly built of small stones and mortar, and the doorway was in the south wall. The tomb, built in the late first century A.D., was robbed in the fourth century. The ashes and bones of the dead, as well as several lamps and figurines which had been placed there, had been thrown in confusion about the chamber. The Greek government is taking measures to restore this tomb and make it accessible to visitors." 1 The investigation of the city walls on the Pnyx hills "conducted by the Department of Antiq- uities of the Greek Government and by the American School of Classical Studies in co6pera- tion, has practically completed the exploration of that section of the defences of Athens which lies on the crest of the Pnyx range between the Hill of the Nymphs and the Hill of the Muses, a length of ca. 1 kilometre. This ridge would seem to has been first fortified as a second, inner line of defence within the old Themistoclean enceinte toward the end of the fourth century B.c. Of this earliest fortification, the curtain wall has been traced throughout its length, at least four of its towers have been found, an elaborate gateway has been explored and a large building that would seem to form an integral part of the system has 1 For this report and its illustrations I am in- debted to Mr. Morgan. been discovered on top of the central Pnyx Hill. Subsequently, perhaps in the second half of the third century B.C., after the abandonment of the Long Walls, this 'cross wall' apparently became the city's one and only line of defence toward the south. Along the great part of the central Pnyx Hill the line of the wall was at this time moved to a stronger position farther out on the shoulder of the ridge. Certain alterations at other points of the original system are also to be assigned to this period. The exploration of the present season has produced evidence of damage to parts of the defences in the first century A.D., and of its repair probably in the following century. In very late Roman times this whole line of fortifications was thoroughly reconditioned and strengthened, and, finally, some minor adjustments are to be dated as late as the twelfth century. "The earliest line of wall with which we are here concerned left the Themistoclean enceinte at a point to the northwest of the Hill of the Nymphs, made its way up and over that steep hill, thence followed the ridge of the central Pnyx Hill, pass- ing above the Assembly Place, and so continued up the Hill of the Muses, on the top of which it rejoined the earlier circuit wall. The construction of this wall involved the demolition of numerous private houses along its path. The curtain wall as preserved consists of a socle ca. 2.70 m. wide of large blocks laid along the inner and outer face so as to confine a core of broken stone and clay. In most places the interior of the wall is divided into compartments by cross-blocks laid as headers at intervals of two stretchers (Fig. 8, p. 154). At one point cross-walls were found built of small stones laid dry. The socle varied in height according to the configuration of the rugged terrain, showing in the parts explored 1 to 4 courses. The stone employed was a hard conglomerate, freely sup- plemented by re-used building blocks of all sorts. At one point on the north slope of the Hill of the Muses the socle is still capped with sun-dried brick, and, since this section appears to be part of the original construction, we may assume that the upper part of the wall throughout its length was built of that material. The towers were widely spaced and varied greatly in size and plan. Their arrangement may best be studied on the north slope of the Hill of the Muses, which was covered by two rectangular and one curvilinear tower between the gate at its foot and another hypo- thetical rectangular tower on its summit. In their lower parts the towers were built like the curtain,</page><page sequence="28">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS 157 i.e. they consist of a facing of conglomerate blocks with an interior packing of small or broken stone. The gate towers, perhaps all the towers, were carried up to their full height in stone rather than brick. "Our line of wall was probably broken by two main gateways, one between the central Pnyx Hill and the Hill of the Nymphs, the other be- tween the central hill and the Hill of the Muses, i.e. on the line of the ancient 'Road through Koile.' The study of the former has been rendered difficult, or indeed impossible by extensive quarry- ing operations of later times and by the presence of the Observatory Garden. Of the other gate complex one half lies beneath a modern public road, and one half beneath the Church of St. Demetrios. The part beneath the roadway has been explored and on the basis of it the scheme of the whole may be restored with reasonable assur- ance. We have to do with a double gateway or dipylon, defended primarily by two square towers (ca. 8.00 m. to the side) lying in the line of the wall on either side of the roadway. From the mid-points of their inner faces spur walls extend cityward and then return toward one another at right angles to form a court and an inner point of closure. In the original scheme probably only the city side of the court was closed by an actual gate. "The explorations of this season established the plan of a hitherto unsuspected large rectangu- lar enclosure, that with a width of ca. 19.50 m. and length of ca. 150 m. covers much of the top of the central Pnyx Hill toward its western end, and ap- pears to form a part of these earlier fortifications. There remain the beddings for the outer walls, painstakingly cut in the bedrock, and a few of the large conglomerate blocks of its lowest foundation course. Though the western end of the structure was completely cleared over its full width for a length of over 12.00 m., no trace of interior walls or columns came to light. This suggests that the interior divisions, if any, must have been effected by some unsubstantial construction, e.g. brick walls on light stone socles. The building may have served as a barracks or a military arsenal. "Quantities of pottery found in the core of the wall and towers at various points and in signifi- cant places along the foundations of the great rectangular building suggest for their construction a date around the end of the fourth century B.c. We may with much plausibility associate this activity with the extensive program for the re- habilitation of the defences of Athens, the Peiraeus and the Long Walls initiated by Habron in 307/06 B.c.1 "Part of this new wall was utilized by Demetrios Poliorketes in 294 B.c., when he fortified the Hill of the Muses for the reception of his Macedonian garrison after subduing Athens. By carrying a short line of wall below the crest of the hill on its city side, joining it at either end to the already existing wall, he formed a keep on the top of the hill. The position, naturally strong by reason of the steep and in places precipitous slope of the hill, was further strengthened by the construction of three rectangular towers on the newly built cross wall: one at either end where it left the earlier walls and one in the middle, menacing the Acropolis. This middle tower had already been discovered and identified by Skias at the end of the last century, but the remainder of the fort had still to be explored. Much of the lower part of the great central tower remains (Fig. 9); elsewhere the dressed beddings and an occasional conglom- erate block indicate the plan of wall and towers. In material and construction this Macedonian work resembles closely the earlier wall described above, but its workmanship is rather more careful. "Now that we have come to know the strength of this fortress we can thoroughly appreciate the triumph of the Athenians when they succeeded in capturing it in 286 B.c. We can understand too why it should have been chosen again by the Macedonians as the seat of another garrison force installed later in the same century and why, after their speedy expulsion, it should have been in- cluded among the forts garrisoned by the Athe- nian ephebes. "In 1936 there was discovered on top of the central Pnyx Hill a line of wall distinguished by the soft white poros of which it was entirely con- structed. The excavations of the present year have established the course and all the essential features of this fortification. It is, as previously conjectured, a replacement of the earlier wall over almost the entire length of the central hill. The first wall had been kept close to the very crest of the hill, largely, it would seem, in order to in- clude in its course the great rectangular building that had of necessity to be placed on the compara- tively level top of the ridge. A steeper approach from the land side and so a stronger position was 1 "It will be recalled that the building specifica- tions published that year have survived in large part in I.G.

ROUND TOWER OF WHITE POROS WALL FIG. 10. - CENTRAL TOWER OF MACEDONIAN FORT ON HILL OF MUSES (Courtesy of Mr. Thompson and Mr. Scranton)</page><page sequence="30">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS 159 now gained by setting the new line of wall farther out on the brow of the hill, ca. 10.00 m. beyond the old. The new wall was pierced near its middle by a narrow gateway that was flanked on either side by a massive buttress projecting cityward. The positions and dimensions of six rectangular and one curvilinear tower have been fixed along the face of the wall. This last tower has straight sides and curving front, a massive outer wall and a core built up largely of construction debris. It has now been completely cleared and takes its place among the most imposing remains of the city's fortifica- tions (Fig. 10). Of the rectangular towers one shows massive stonework, at least in its lower part; the others were built with heavy stone walls around cores of working chips and earth. The cur- tain varies in thickness from 1.30 to 2.00 m. and in all parts shows a massive foundation of large poros blocks. The thinness of the wall and the presence along it of enormous masses of working chips suggest that it was built to its full height of stone. At intervals of 4.00 to 5.00 m. the curtain was reinforced by stone buttresses ca. 1.30 m. square set against its inner face. Behind the tow- ers these buttresses were doubled or tripled in length. "We may perhaps associate with this building program an alteration in the gateway on the road through Koile. A large buttress was set against that corner of the explored gate tower which looked into the court, a similar buttress was presumably set against the corresponding corner of the neighboring tower, and a great gate was swung between them. White poros used in the construction of the buttress is identical with that found elsewhere in this wall and a cornice block re-used in the buttress may derive from the earlier wall. "On the very top of the Hill of the Muses a rectangular tower has been exposed which again exhibits the characteristic material and workman- ship of the white poros wall. It is significant that the face of this tower cuts across the line of the Themistoclean wall, but shows no trace of a junc- tion with it. The older wall would seem no longer to have been in use at this time. "A limited amount of pottery found among and below the construction debris of the white poros wall suggests for it a date in the latter part of the third century B.c. It is tempting, therefore, to connect this extensive and costly piece of work with the program of repairs initiated and largely financed by Mikion and Eurykleides, and recorded on extant inscriptions.' Various indications had already suggested to scholars that the Long Walls had been abandoned by this time. From the dis- position of the newly found tower of white poros on top of the Hill of the Muses we may infer further that the Themistoclean enceinte was now abandoned in its course across the south side of the city, that the newly repaired wall on the Pnyx Hills was henceforth to serve as the sole line of defence in that region and that consequently a very considerable area on the southern slopes of those hills which had previously been densely in- habited, as shown by the traces of houses, was now left outside the walls. The ensuing depopula- tion of this area is attested by the numerous bur- ials which were now made on either side of the ancient road in its course between the two lines of wall. The tombstones and offerings removed from these graves in recent years appear to date exclu- sively from the later Hellenistic and Roman periods. "The gateway on the Road through Koile was damaged early in the first century A.D. The iron sheath that had covered the pivot of the gate was found in its socket in the threshold and a dozen of the great iron studs from the wooden door lay twisted and rusted where the door had fallen. This wreckage had been speedily buried by the gathering gravel, the potsherds from which re- vealed the date. An exploratory trench cut across the line of the wall a few metres to the north of the gateway showed that an enormous mass of earth had been heaped against the outer face of the wall. At this point it still lies over 5.00 m. deep. This activity also occurred in the first half of the first century A.D. It is tempting and perhaps justifiable to connect the building of the mound and the damage to the gate and to attribute both to some violent assault otherwise unrecorded. "Before long the damage was made good. The great gateway was repaired and rearranged. The outer entrance way was narrowed and a new threshold was laid in it. This repair is probably contemporary with a rearrangement of the wall on top of the central Pnyx Hill. A considerable length of the white poros wall was abandoned and the line was once more drawn back to the crest of the hill. Pottery found in association with the repair in the gateway and with the new wall on the hilltop suggests for this activity a date well on in the second century A.D. "In late Roman times the fortifications on the 1 I.G. II2, 791, 834.</page><page sequence="31">160 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Pnyx Hills were neglected and fell into disrepair. The angles between towers and curtains were used as burial places, and in more than one spot entire family burial plots were unearthed: the tile-cov- ered graves of adults and children lying side by side, and those of successive generations one above the other. The coins and offerings found in the tombs date from the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. Soon after the making of these latest burials, a thoroughgoing reconditioning of the entire sys- tem of fortifications took place. The line as established in the second century A.D. was fol- lowed. Parts of the old wall that still stood were repaired with mortar. In many places the curtain had to be rebuilt from the bottom up; here the old blocks were re-used and were supplemented with rubble masonry. All the old towers would seem to have been rehabilitated, sometimes with con- siderable modifications. The curvilinear towers, for instance, both that of the earliest wall and that of the white poros period, were now squared. Many new towers were added; on the wall that runs up the north slope of the Hill of the Muses, one new tower was set midway between each pair of old rebuilt towers. These new towers are com- paratively small, measuring on the average ca. 5.00 x 6.00 m., and they are slight in construction, being closed on their three exposed sides with walls only 1.00 m. thick. The old gateway on the road through Koile was repaired and was kept in use. "The evidence of the burials noted above, combined with that of pottery found in associa- tion with the reconstruction, suggests for the work a date in the sixth century A.D. We are probably justified, therefore, in ascribing the activity to Justinian, who, according to Procopius, rebuilt the walls of Athens. This new knowledge sheds welcome light on the extent and the disposition of the city in this period. "The gateway on the road through Koile was altered once more at a much later date. The north- east corner of the south gate tower was reinforced with a buttress of rubble stonework; the great marble threshold between the two gate towers was reset at a higher level and the roadway where it passed between the towers was raised in level. The pottery found in association with these alter- ations is of the eleventh and twelfth centuries A.D. The work was probably done in the latter century. No other work on the fortifications of the Pnyx is certainly attributable to this period. On the other hand, it is not likely that a single gateway should have been repaired or that it alone should have been in use at any period. The Agora Excava- tions of the past season have exposed a length of fortification wall on the northwest shoulder of the Acropolis that is probably to be assigned to the twelfth century. The same danger may have evoked these contemporary activities on Acropolis and Pnyx. "The excavations of the past two seasons have thus fixed in all essential details the scheme and history of the fortifications on the Pnyx Hills." 1 ELIZABETH PIERCE BLEGEN 1 For this report I am indebted to Mr. Homer Thompson and Mr. Robert Scranton.</page></plain_text>
