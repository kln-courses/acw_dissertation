<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kafka's Josefine: The Animal as the Negative Site of Narration Margot Norris Josefine, die Singerin oder Das Volk der Miuse, the last piece Kafka wrote,' is not a story about art, or the repudiation of art, but a gesture of retraction not unlike his own last will and testament. In his several instructions to Max Brod, he requested the burning of his entire Nachlafi, unread, and forbade the reprinting of published works ("should they disappear altogether that would please me best")2-a request Brod not only refused to honor, but told Kafka he would refuse to honor. Brod, therefore, exonerates himself for defying his friend's wishes by interpreting Kafka's will in a more complex way, as a testament embodying the double gestures of Kafka's destruction and Brod's redemption of the works. "Con- vinced as he was that I meant what I said, Franz should have ap- pointed another executor if he had been absolutely and finally determined that his instructions should stand."3 Kafka was forced to leave us his works, albeit damned and with the mark of death upon them. But inJosefine, his last work, he outwits his defiant read- ership by writing a narrative that consumes itself in the telling. Kafka's last story marks the culmination of a generic revolution from representational to virtually self-referential prose. IfJosefine had a literary antecedent it would have been Franz Grillparzer's Der 1 Max Brod, Franz Kafka, A Biography (New York: Schocken, 1970), p. 95. 2 Max Brod's postscript to the first edition of The Trial which reproduces Kafka's correspondence on the disposition of his work, is reprinted in Franz Kafka, The Trial, trans.

Yet in Josefine these themes are drained of their significance except as negative indices of the character's dissolution. Josefine's unmusicality does not refer to Josefine, but to the narrator's other statements about her singing. Kafka's last works have some of the self-referentiality of abstract painting, but for philosophical rather than formal ends that have to do with the ontology of the beast. The animal narrator enables the virtual voiding of representation from the work, the deletion of all human features and cultural references except those the narration itself will prove spurious. But the result is not merely a simulacrum of animal consciousness with its necessarily anthropomorphic con- figuration. Instead, the narration constitutes a bestial gesture that marks the trajectory from signification to its obliteration, from re- membering to forgetting. Becoming the beast is remembering to forget as being the beast is forgetting to remember-a moment represented by Nietzsche in a hypothetical interlocution: Der Mensch fragt wohl einmal das Tier: warum redest du mir nicht von deinem Glicke und siehst mich nur an? Das Tier will auch antworten und sagen: das kommt daher, daB ich immer gleich vergesse, was ich sagen wollte-da vergaB es aber auch schon diese Antwort und schwieg; so daB der Mensch sich darob verwunderte.5 The ontology of the beast must be situated not in a form of consciousness but in that border region on the edge of conscious- ness, where every perception is erased at the moment of its inscrip- tion. This condition is the prehistory of the child, a condition ar- ticulated by Freud in "From the History of an Infantile Neurosis," in which he links the Wolf Man's prehistoric knowledge phylogeneti- cally to the site of animal being.

Worin dies bestehen mag, entzieht sich jeder Vorstellung; wir haben nur die eine ausgezeichnete Analogie mit dem weitgehenden instinktiven Wissen der Tiere zur Verfugung.6 Freud's metaphor for the psychic process is the mystic writing pad, the child's toy whose prehistoric trace structure becomes more compellingly apparent if it is imagined as being operated by two hands: one writing, the other simultaneously erasing what is in the process of being written.7 Kafka's narrative will constitute an anal- ogous metaphor-a rhetorically and logically self-consuming fic- tion. The narrator of Josefine is a mouse-as we infer from his iden- tification with the pack, and his representation of its collective point of view. The question raised by having an animal narrator is not, in the first instance, "What sort of story would a mouse tell?" or "How would an animal story differ from a human story?" Kafka uses the narrative deviation of Josefine to raise questions about the very enabling of narration itself-"Can a mouse tell a story at all?" and "How can a story be told at all?" The mouse narrator, it turns out, cannot tell a story after all, because of the peculiarity of his mem- bership in the pack. Narrative depends on the ability to sustain differences, and as Josefine's experience illustrates-it is impossible to maintain difference among the mouse folk. The narrator, like Josefine, fails-and instead of being told, Josefine's story becomes negatively inscribed in the failure of the narration. "Unsere Sangerin heiBt Josefine." The peculiarity of this open- ing statement is that insofar as it establishes a code, it has no conse- quence for the story. It doesn't finally matter what the singer is called, and there is never any question that she might actually be called something else. The actual function of the statement in the narration is antonomastic-as though it read, "Josefine is our singer," or "Josefine is called our singer."

Without this distinctive feature, only her name would remain, a difference, to be sure, but without narrative con- sequence. IfJosefine is not a singer, she loses her characterological function and ceases to exist as a fictional figure-and, indeed, Josefine, die Sdngerin oder Das Volk der Mduse, constitutes more than one kind of disappearing act. The deconstruction of Josefine, the singer, begins immediately, although without our quite realizing it. Wer sie nicht gehort hat, kennt nicht die Macht des Gesanges. Es gibt niemanden, den ihr Gesang nicht fortreiBt ...8 The litotic structure of these statements turns them into under- statements, into intensified praises of the singer. Only much later, when we have begun to doubt that Josefine is a singer, that she has ever sung, or ever been heard, do we hear the literal residue behind the trope in these words.9 The double negative, the denial of the contrary, suggests the possibility that there may have been nothing there in the first place-no song, no singer-and that the state- ments refer only to a void or a trace. The narrator eschews an idealistic or Platonic argument al- together, that Josefine's song must inscribe some musical essence, in favor of a semiological analysis-that in order to constitute singing, Josefine's sounds must exhibit some distinctive features that allow them to be contrasted with ordinary mice speech or piping. Josefine fails by this criterion, and to clinch any lingering doubt, the narrator evokes a cunning demonstration in the form of the innocent piping up of a silly little mouse during one of Josefine's performances-"Nun, es war ganz dasselbe . . . den Un- terschied zu bezeichnen, ware unmoglich gewesen" (174). Although Josefine's singing is reduced, as it were, to quotations 8 Franz Kafka, "Josefine, die Sangerin oder das Volk der Mause," Sdmtliche Er- zihlungen (Frankfurt am Main: Fischer, 1970), p. 172.

The narrator attempts to do this with the modern argument (his nut- cracking analogy resonates with Dada and conceptual art theory) that art is whatever is perceived as such by artist and audience. The tautological nature of this reasoning is unassailable, but Josefine's audience refuses to validate her piping as singing. The narrator's theory shatters on the imperfect reciprocity between performer and audience that attends other strange conceptual performances in Kafka's works-the fasting in Ein Hungerkiinstler, and the execution in In der Strafkolonie. The narrator submits the audi- ence's devotion to Josefine to a series of rationalizations: the mice listen not to her piping but to the stillness surrounding it; they hear themselves, not Josefine, in her piping; they attend not a concert but an assembly of the folk; they cater to Josefine's temperamental whims not as to an artist but as to an indulged child, etc. Ultimately, his argument achieves a wonderful sophistical circularity-"Moge Josefine beschiitzt werden vor der Erkenntnis, daB die Tatsache, daB wir ihr zuhoren, ein Beweis gegen ihren Gesang ist" (178). Josefine is invalidated as a singer, the mouse folk are invalidated as her audience, their difference is expunged and with it one of the major anthropomorphic features of mouse culture. We are pre- pared for this by the earlier description of the mice's unmusicality as a pure trace structure: they have only an intimation (eine Ahnung) of the songs that exist but cannot be sung. Yet the relationship between Josefine and the mouse folk is expressed in another cul- tural metaphor-that of parent and child-which must also be emptied of its anthropomorphic overtones and restored to its purely biological significance. The parental metaphor initially serves a political function. By interpreting her influence as a secondary effect resulting from the pack's indulgence, the power struggle between Josefine and the mouse folk appears to be resolved in their favor. "The actual riddle of her enormous influence" is solved by suggesting that her power is as illusory as that of the insistent child whose parent good- naturedly gives her her way. However, the anthropomorphic resi- due of the metaphor, which defines the child in terms of an ego development resisting socialization (selfish, demanding, irrespon- sible, foolish) suggests that in this struggle, power-like signification-is a function of difference. The title of the work, Josefine, die Sdngerin oder Das Volk der Mduse, poses the crux of the</page><page sequence="6">M L N 371 work as a question of difference. If Josefine can be distinguished from the mouse folk, even as an infantile brat-"dann freilich wird sie wiitend, dann stampft sie mit den FuBen, flucht ganz unmad- chenhaft, ja sie beiBt sogar" (175)-she becomes anthropomor- phized, individualized, significant, and her story can be told. If not, she becomes appropriated by the mouse folk, animalized, oblitera- ted, her story prevented. The narrator consequently redefines the child metaphor in a way that empties it of its anthropomorphic ego-defining characteristics and obliterates its difference from the parent. The child's tem- peramental symptoms of ego immaturity are replaced by kinds of physical immaturity such as difficulty in running, piping, and see- ing. The human cultural reference to schools is retracted ("Wir haben keine Schulen" [179]) and with it the notion of childhood as a temporal plenum. The young in the swarm are discontinuous within their momentum ("immer, immer wieder neue, ohne Ende, ohne Unterbrechung" [179]) but indistinguishable from one an- other. Childhood itself is a trace structure that disappears while it emerges-"kaum erscheint ein Kind, ist es nicht mehr Kind" (179). The difference between child and adult is oxymoronically col- lapsed by making the mouse folk eternally, inextinguishably child- ish and prematurely old at the same time. The parental metaphor also defines the controversy governing the relationship between Josefine and the pack with respect to de- pendency and protection. The predominant question-who pro- tects whom?-is not in itself an anthropomorphic formulation. But corresponding similes, such as Josefine craning her neck above the crowd like a shepherd surveying his flock before a thunderstorm, generate cultural and literary resonances that resound in Kafka's other works. Among these, the demonic version of the Orpheus motif-the Pied Piper of Hamlin-would seem best to fit the am- biguously saving and dooming effect of Josefine's song. Josefine claims that her music saves, or at least sustains, the folk at times of political or economic emergency; they claim that her singing in- creases their jeopardy by attracting predators. Kafka himself confounds the critical tendency to endow his fic- tional music with spiritual essence and transcendental effects ("Musik war fur Kafkaja stets eine M6glichkeit, den Menschen aus allen irdischen Grenzen zu treiben")10 by satirically describing his childhood music lessons as exercises in mechanical Pavlovian 10 Wilhelm Emrich, Franz Kafka (Frankfurt am Main: Athenaeum, 1961), p. 124.</page><page sequence="7">372 MARGOT NORRIS conditioning-"mein Violinlehrer hat mich aus Verzweiflung in der Musikstunde lieber iiber Stocke springen lassen, die er selbst gehalten hat, und die musikalischen Fortschritte bestanden darin, daB er von Stunde zu Stunde die St6cke h6her hielt."11 Caco- phonous circus music and blaring hunting horns reduce the canine narrator of Forschungen eines Hundes to a writhing bundle of agony. If the animal's susceptibility to music is indeed physiological and compulsive, then an ironic, affirmative residue becomes audi- ble in Gregor Samsa's famous erotesis-"War er ein Tier, da ihn Musik so ergriff?" (92). Like Grete Samsa in Die Verwandlung or the Pied Piper of Ham- lin, Josefine seems to serve as a musical pharmakos effecting good and ill, offering salvation and perdition. Either version of her character might confirm Josefine's influence-the negative version especially so, since it obliges the narrator to explain the mice's willingness to risk casualty in order to attend her performances. After a futile set of reciprocal denials-Josefine's rude "Ich pfeife auf euren Schutz" (176) is interpreted as embarrassed, childish gratitude-the narrator redefines the parental function in a way that essentially extrudes Josefine from her own performances. The human sense of parenting as specific nurturant activity is translated in mouse culture into the generalized security conferred on indi- viduals by membership in the pack-"Freilich, der Kraft- unterschied zwischen dem Volk und dem Einzelnen ist so un- geheuer, es geniigt, daB es den Schiitzling in die Warme seiner Nihe zieht, und er ist beschiitzt genug" (176). The mice assemble not to hear Josefine sing but for the sake of an assembly that itself is emptied of all but zoo-affective significance-"Schon tauchen auch wir in das Gefuhl der Menge, die warm, Leib an Leib, scheu at- mend horcht" (175). Reduced to a producer of incidental music at her own perfor- mances, Josefine is effaced as both a singer and as a saviour, not by having her influence denied, but by having the concept of influ- ence itself reduced to a meaningless anthropomorphism in mouse culture. The issue is not whether Josefine saves or betrays the pack but whether the concept of salvation has any significance at all for a fatalistic folk who survive not because they change the course of events, but because their exceptional fertility neutralizes their ex- ceptional mortality. The term "saviour" itself becomes an acyron, as the narrator describes the mouse as a folk who somehow always 1 Briefe an Felice, p. 103.</page><page sequence="8">M L N 373 manage to save themselves even at the cost of horrifying casualties. The statement makes no sense, the casualties contradict the saving (avoidance of loss or waste), and yet one more anthropomorphic feature in Josefine's differentiation from the pack has been de- leted. The final labor dispute between Josefine and the pack reveals the actual object of their struggle to be something other than either labor or art-"Nun ist es ja klar, daB Josefine nicht eigentlich das anstrebt, was sie wortlich verlangt" (182). The ulterior motive is differentiation; Josefine wants to be regarded as a goddess, i.e. to have her difference acknowledged. The narrator confirms this when he concedes that the labor exemption would have no defacto significance in Josefine's life-she would work no less and her singing would grow no better. What she would achieve by being exempted from ordinary labor is "6ffentliche, eindeutige, die Zeiten iiberdauernde, fiber alles bisher Bekannte sich weit erhebende Anerkennung ihrer Kunst" (182)-not only differ- entiation, but recognition of difference. The final conflict between Josefine and the mouse folk emerges as a phantom campaign in which the trace structure of difference becomes apparent. If Josefine possesses difference-and the nar- rator cites and rejects the argument that her very ability to conceive of demanding an exemption from work proves this-that differ- ence, like a zero suffix, lacks the materiality to make itself perceiv- able or verifiable. It is simultaneously present and absent, as Josefine's strategies demonstrate. She offers not positive incentives (differences) but negative penalties (lack of difference) to further her cause: she will not sing at the limits of her talent if her petition is denied. Since her difference is immaterial, her threat to cut the grace notes from her song cannot be verified-"Sie hat angeblich ihre Drohung wahr gemacht, mir allerdings ist kein Unterschied gegeniiber ihren friiheren Vorfiihrungen aufgefallen" (184). Her foot injury, likewise, is unverifiable and the mouse folk believe her disability feigned. Josefine has no means of effecting recognition of her difference. The mouse folk's response to Josefine's stratagems is carefully emptied of its anthropomorphic residue to constitute a pure, abstract impermeability to difference. The narrator repeatedly describes the mouse folk in terms of the emotional equivalent to this ontological condition: cold, judicial, impenetrable, un- moved-in short, profoundly in-different. Their refusal of Jose- fine's petition lacks all human motives or rational basis. The</page><page sequence="9">374 MARGOT NORRIS narrator deliberately raises, and dismisses, the specter of a folk exasperated beyond endurance by Josefine's demands and actively resisting her dominance. He likewise presents no arguments for their refusal-"Es miiht sich auch mit der Widerlegung der Gesuchsbegriindung nicht sehr ab" (181). The mice simply do not change in their comportment towards Josefine; they admit no dif- ference into their own behavior-"das Volk h6rt ihren Gesang dankbar und entziickt wie friiher, aber wegen der Kiirzung macht es nicht viel Aufhebens" (184). Their indifference does not repre- sent an emotional or rational counterstrategy on the part of the mouse folk. It constitutes instead their radical animality. Josefine's last stratagem is intrinsically ironic. Unsuccessful in modifying her song in a way that would create a noticable differ- ence (not singing as well as she could; curtailing, restoring, or de- leting her grace notes; singing in ostensible pain or weakness) she stops singing altogether. Josefine therefore disappears not literally, but logically-by obliterating her "difference" from the pack. Her technique achieves a singular circularity as she combats in- difference (coldness, lack of recognition) by becoming in-different (undistinguished, unimportant). Only her anthropomorphic mo- tive, her resort to a stratagem, distinguishes her disappearance from the "disappearance" indigenous to the animality of the mouse folk. Yet the narrator cancels even this last little anthropomorph- ism by suggesting that her ploy may have been no ploy, that her disappearance was not a stratagem at all but a destined instinctual act of her mouse nature-"Sonderbar, wie falsch sie rechnet, die Kluge, so falsch, daB man glauben sollte, sie rechne gar nicht, son- dern werde nur weiter getrieben von ihrem Schicksal, das in un- serer Welt nur ein trauriges werden kann" (185). Josefine's disappearance fully reveals the trace structure of mouse culture. Josefine's silence is as indistinguishable from other silences as her piping was indistinguishable from other piping. Paradoxically, piping and silence (which should be mutually exclu- sive) become interchangeable and indistinguishable from each other-"wie werden die Versammlungen in v6lliger Stummheit moglich sein? Freilich, waren sie nicht auch mit Josefine stumm?" (185). Accordingly, the mouse folk react no differently to Josefine absent than to Josefine present-"Sie versteckt sich und singt nicht, aber das Volk, ruhig, ohne sichtbare Enttauschung, herrisch, eine in sich ruhende Masse ... dieses Volk zieht weiter seines Weges" (185).</page><page sequence="10">M L N 375 The interplay of singing and silence, and its connection to a hierarchy of cunning, is deployed so brilliantly in Kafka's very short work, "Das Schweigen der Sirenen,"'2 that it merits a brief digression here. The piece shares the rhetorical structure of other Kafka works, includingJosefine, that construct a dilemma through a series of assertions and retractions: The song of the sirens is dangerous Ulysses stops his ears with wax and chains himself to a mast The song of the sirens pierces through wax and undoes chains Ulysses trusts to his stratagem The silence of the sirens is more dangerous than their song. Ulysses appears doomed either way, since silence and singing, which, logically, should be mutually exclusive, become inter- changeable and undifferentiated in their effects. The solution to the dilemma depends not on a stratagem per se, but on a failure to perceive the failure of a stratagem. By thinking the wax and chains are successful, Ulysses mistakes the sirens' si- lence for escape from their song. Not his cunning, but the failure of his cunning, manages to drive a wedge of difference-or differ- ance, if you will-between the silence and the unheard song. But Kafka cannot resist the final convolution of the conundrum, and he adds the following possibility in a codicil to the story: wily Ulysses hears the silence of the sirens with impunity by pretending to not hear their song. He appropriates the trace structure of silence as both a presence and an absence, and neutralizes the danger of both the sirens' song and the sirens' silence by collapsing them as positive and negative versions of one another. His ruse, the pretended failure to hear their song, is interposed like a "shield" between himself and the sirens' double danger. Some of the features of this Ulyssean cunning pertain also to the mouse folk of Josefine-notably its complementary relationship to musicality-"mit dem Lacheln dieser Schlauheit pflegen wir uns fiber alles hinwegzutrosten, auch wenn wir einmal-was aber nicht geschieht-das Verlangen nach dem Glick haben sollten, das von der Musik vielleicht ausgeht" (172). With its rational implications, this Schlauheit seems a peculiar distinctive feature to characterize the mouse folk until we note how it is modified to empty it of anthropomorphic significance. As a "perfectly harmless cunning" this prized attribute is stripped of the malice, the ulterior motive, 12 "Das Schweigen der Sirenen," Erzdhlungen, p. 304.</page><page sequence="11">376 MARGOT NORRIS the defensive emotional residue that colors its human manifesta- tion. Furthermore, Josefine's "unworthy tactics"-her attempts to manipulate and threaten the mouse folk into compliance-appears to be different from that uncalculated, fatalistic cunning that causes her, in the end, to outwit herself and unconsciously, inad- vertantly, rejoin the mouse folk. She does this through her failure, like Ulysses, to understand the failure of her stratagem. This zoomorphic cunning of the mice is irrational rather than su- prarational, unconscious and instinctual, a matter of "inadequate and even childish"'3 means. The cunning and slyness of the mouse folk operates on a double register of human and animal desire that is patterned on the his- torical models of Hegel and Nietzsche, respectively. Josefine wants nothing less than "6ffentliche, eindeutige, die Zeiten iber- dauernde ... Anerkennung ihrer Kunst" (182)-that is, "pure prestige"'4 of the kind that animates the Hegelian Master in the evolution of human self-consciousness. The mouse folk not only deny Josefine her recognition-"sie singt ja ihrer Meinung nach vor tauben Ohren ... auf wirkliches Verstandnis, wie sie es meint, hat sie langst verzichten gelernt" (174)-but they refuse to enter into the antithetical relationship of the Master/Slave conflict by refusing to claim recognition for themselves. Instead of a dialectical conflict that engenders a human and spiritual evolution, the his- torical movement of the mice folk is counter-evolutionary-a sur- render to the instinctual, the fated, the animal, a "becoming what one is"'5 that marks the counterprogressive history of Nietzsche's eternal recurrence. Josefine herself loses her struggle for recogni- tion to a Nietzschean amorfati when she submits to her animal fate in the very act and at the very moment she thought to triumph over it. Mediating the relationship between Josefine and the mouse folk is the narrator of the story. This narrator must, in some respects, be seen as Josefine's double, since their respective enterprises- Josefine's music and his history (storytelling, criticism, philo- sophy)-form an anthropomorphic pair. Amid an a-cultural, a-historical species that ostensibly practices neither music nor his- tory, the singer and the narrator stand as diacritically marked 13 Ibid., p. 304. 14 Alexandre Kojeve, Introduction to the Reading of Hegel, ed.

Both constitute difference ("NurJosefine macht eine Aus- nahme; sie liebt die Musik" 172) and create difference (the nar- rator's creation of character, event, conflict). But as a member of the mouse folk the narrator can no more maintain difference than can Josefine. His story collapses as Josefine is retracted as a singer, her performances become indistinguishable from one another and from other piping and silence, and her conflict with the mouse folk dissolves in the convolutions of her double self-betrayal. The nar- rator's career is fated to follow the ontological trajectory of Josefine's career as a singer. Josefine and the narrator function as creators of difference be- cause they have subjectivity, a consciousness of the self as different from the other, from the mass, and as possessing an individualistic point of view. Josefine's subjectivity results in psychological and political centricity: she creates centers of opinion and performance amid the random dispersal of the mouse folk. Her centricity is literal and spatial as Josefine determines the site of her concerts not by the needs of her audience but purely by her presence-"Sie kann dies tun, wo sie will, es muB kein weithin sichtbarer Platz sein, irgendein verborgener, in zufalliger Ausblickslaune gewahlter Winkel ist ebensogut brauchbar" (175). Her performance is, in some sense, no more than an assembly of the mouse folk of which she is the center. The narrator, conversely, conducts his critique of Josefine from his own point of vantage, orienting himself initially to a centered Josefine-"Und wenn man vor ihr sitzt, versteht man sie; Opposition treibt man nur in der Ferne; wenn man vor ihr sitzt, weiB man: was sie hier pfeift, ist kein Pfeifen" (174). Later the narrator revises his critique by shifting his point of view. Josefine becomes displaced as a producer of incidental music, and her per- formance becomes decentered, as mouse relates to neighboring mouse, pressed body to warm body. The narration is sustained by the conventional literary difference of conflict between Josefine and the mouse folk. But if Josefine is positively marked among the mice with respect to music, the mouse folk is not defined as simply unmusical by contrast, like the other half of a phonemic opposition. The narrator clearly intends to confound their identity altogether, making them neither musical nor exactly unmusical, but rather catching them in a slippery rhetorical web of negatives, conditionals, and hypotheticals, that simply dissolves their desire for music altogether into the undif- ferentiated fatalism of their animal cunning:</page><page sequence="13">378 MARGOT NORRIS Stiller Frieden ist uns die liebste Musik; unser Leben ist schwer, wir konnen uns, auch wenn wir einmal alle Tagessorgen abzuschiitteln ver- sucht haben, nicht mehr zu solchen, unserem sonstigen Leben so fernen Dingen erheben, wie es die Musik ist. Doch beklagen wir es nicht sehr; nicht einmal so weit kommen wir; eine gewisse praktische Schlauheit, die wir freilich auch auBerst dringend brauchen, halten wir fur unsern groBten Vorzug, und mit dem Lacheln dieser Schlauheit pflegen wir uns fiber alles hinwegzutrosten, auch wenn wir einmal-was aber nicht geschieht- das Verlangen dem Gliick haben sollten, das von der Musik vielleicht ausgeht. (172; Italics mine) The musical difference between Josefine and the mouse folk is confounded by the literal residue of the metaphor that equates music with silence ("Quiet peace is our favorite music"). The dramatic center of the work is the political conflict between two groups, Josefine's sycophantic retinue and her opposition-a conflict whose anthropomorphic configuration makes it accessible to the allegorical interpretation that Josefine is a parable of the conflict between the artist and a philistine society.16 But the nar- rator confounds this conflict too, first by qualifying his own posi- tion with respect to the opposition group, "zu der auch ich halb gehore" (174), then by qualifying the opposition as "wir angebliche Gegner" (175), and finally, by dismissing her opponents altogether as Josefine's paranoid delusion, "Hatte sie wirklich Feinde, wie sie sagt ... Aber sie hat keine Feinde" (182). The conflict between Josefine's supporters and opponents is logically neutralized from the first, when their difference is expunged. They act exactly the same, as we are told that "diese Opposition, zu der auch ich halb geh6re, bewundert sie gewiB nicht weniger als es die Menge tut" (174). 16 For interpretations that explore the question of the status of art inJosefine see: Heinz Politzer, Franz Kafka: Parable and Paradox (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1962), p. 311; John Hibberd, Kafka in Context (London: Studio Vista, 1975), p. 136. Wilhelm Emrich treats Josefine as a critique of art as the mystique of genius, while Walter Sokel sees Josefine's art as the promise for a reconciliation of the proletariat: Franz Kafka-Tragik und Ironie: Zur Struktur seiner Kunst (Miinchen/Wien: Albert Langer/Georg Muller Verlag, 1964), p. 509. Patrick Bridgwater in Kafka and Nietzsche (Bonn: Bouvier, 1974), p. 143, sees Josefine's song as Dionysian Rausch- Kunst scorned by an Apollonian public. Many extant interpretations ofJosefine read the story as allegory of the Jews of the Diaspora, and a number identify Josefine with specific Yiddish performers such as Mrs. Tshisik (Woodring) and Yitskhok Levi (Beck).

Kafka indicates a reason for this when he tells us why it is impossible for the mouse folk to laugh at Josefine: "Uber das aber, was einem anvertraut ist, lacht man nicht; dariiber zu lachen, ware Pflichtverletzung" (176). Laughter is pos- sible only when there is separation, alienation, distance- difference. The inability to laugh at Josefine is symptomatic of her oneness with the species, her interchangeability with every member of it-a symptom underscored later when we learn that Josefine's "enemies" do not laugh at her because they recognize that the folk would treat them in an identical way, were they to try to establish their own difference. "Schon deshalb nicht, weil sich hier das Volk in seiner kalten richterlichen Haltung zeigt, wie man es sonst bei uns nur sehr selten sieht. Und wenn einer auch diese Haltung in diesem Falle billigen mag, so schlieBt doch die bloBe Vorstellung, daB sich einmal das Volk ahnlich gegen ihn selbst verhalten konnte, jede Freude aus" (182). Josefine's "enemies" have imaginatively identified with her and exchanged places with her. The difference of their hostility (or the hostility of their difference) is collapsed. There remains the reciprocal meconnaissance between Josefine and the mouse folk. But if Josefine believes this to be a mere con- fusion of signifieds, that she believes her song to be one thing while the mice believe it to be another, the narrator, who believes her song to be nothing makes the misunderstanding more radical still. Yet the narrator, in treating her song as signifying nothing, treats it like the Lacanian parole vide,17 the empty Word that retains social value while saying nothing, that stands for the possibility of communica- tion even while communicating nothing, that functions, ultimately as a tessera-"Josefine behauptet sich, dieses Nichts an Stimme, dieses Nichts an Leistung behauptet sich und schafft sich den Weg zu uns, es tut wohl, daran zu denken" (178). Josefine's song is the trace, the presence of an absence, and serves, in this respect, as an analogue to Jakob's music in Grillparzer's Der arme Spielmann. This meconnaissance becomes, in a sense, the irreducible dif- ference of the work because it makes its trace structure possible. The narrator recognizes that it is equally important for Josefine to 17 See Jacques Lacan, "The Empty World and the Full Word," in The Language of the Self, trans.

But if Josefine knew she were singing nothing, she would not sing at all. This clarifies the narrator's enigmatic reference to the public service rendered by Josefine's sycophants: by keeping her blind to the insignificance of her song, these flatterers keep her singing (177). Conversely, the folk-or at least the narrator-must understand the significance of the insig- nificance of Josefine's singing, a state of affairs Josefine senses and which causes her dissatisfaction with her public adulation-"Eine Ahnung dessen hat sie wohl, warum wiirde sie sonst so leiden- schaftlich leugnen, daB wir ihr zuhoren, aber immer wieder singt sie, pfeift sie sich fiber diese Ahnung hinweg" (178). The also seemingly irreducible difference of sex or gender in the work cannot be dismissed as a merely grammatical attribution-a feminization because Josefine is die Maus. The narration displays cultural sexual attitudes toward Josefine anthropomorphic enough for Michael Feingold to speak of "her virtually feminist bitterness when mouse-males treat her as a mere love object" in his preface to Michael McClure's Obie Award winning play, Josefine: the Mouse Singer.18 But like the parental metaphor, these sexual allusions are also emptied of their cultural content in various ways, and reduced to their biological and insignificant difference. Josefine's behavior contradicts the sexual stereoptypes the nar- rator imposes on her-"sie, die auBerlich eigentlich vollendete Zartheit ist, auffallend zart selbst in unserem an solchen Frauengestalten reichen Volk, erschien damals geradezu gemein" (173). Elsewhere, Josefine flies into a terrible rage, stamps her feet, "flucht ganz unmadchenhaft" (175), and bites-behavior still an- thropomorphic but with its animal residue violently erupting. Josefine's femininity is always introduced at the moment it is de- nied, and her behavior signals not its cultural opposite, masculinity, but its natural opposite, animality. If Josefine's gender distinction seems preserved to the very end, when at her apotheosis she joins her brothers (alle ihre Brider, 185), it is preserved at the moment of dissolution and obliteration when Josefine is lost among them and forgotten like them. The movement of the story of Josefine, such as it is, is enscribed in its entirety in the first paragraph of the work: Josefine moves from music to non-music, from life to death, from difference with the folk to identity with the folk. The narrative "events" at the end 18 Michael McClure, Josephine: The Mouse Singer (New York: New Directions, 1980), in the Preface by Michael Feingold.</page><page sequence="16">M L N 381 of the story, when we learn that Josefine refuses to sing, that she has vanished, that she will die, are merely a mimetic enactment or repetition of the logical movement of the narration in the first paragraph. This interplay of narrative and logic inJosefine reveals the awful secret of story-telling which Kafka was by no means the first to discover: Sterne's Tristram Shandy illustrates as well as any work that story-telling requires the repression of its own logical processes and that narration and narrative, logic and tale-spinning, are inevitably at war with one another. In Josefine this problem is best explored as one of logical direc- tionality. The narrator never gets on with a tale because instead of the logical processes that propel a story forward-belief in causal- ity, the development of consequences, the drawing of inferences and conclusions-his determination to analyze premises and as- sumptions and to explore the ground of Josefine's ontological status deconstructs the narrative. With the pivotal statement "Ich habe oft dariiber nachgedacht, wie es sich mit dieser Musik eigentlich verhalt" (172) the narrator returns the story to its origin, the story becomes the reverse of born, not its negation or opposite, nor a still birth or abortion, but its directional reversal, which, for lack of a word or concept, can only be illustrated with comedienne Joan Rivers' visual joke when she suggested to her parenting class that they run the childbirth film in reverse and watch the infant disappear into the womb. Freud's mystic writing pad has a similar trace structure. "Nur Josefine macht eine Ausnahme; sie liebt die Musik and weiB sie auch zu vermitteln; sie ist die einzige; mit ihrem Hingang wird die Musik-wer weiB wie lange-aus unserem Leben ver- schwinden" (172). As the narrator proceeds to explore the on- tological question, "how it actually is with this music," and Josefine is revealed to pipe just like other mice, the logical erasure of Josefine's difference becomes identical with the death predicted for her. Implicit in all the ambiguous meanings of Hingang, that euphemism for death (passing, transition, disappearance, depar- ture) is the notion that ontologically death is precisely an erasure of difference, a transition from difference to lack of difference, for is it not the case that in life we are all different while in death we are all the same-or, to put it another way, is death not precisely the inability of the living to sustain their difference from the dead? The narrator's sophistical logic, which might be paraphrased into the following syllogistic forms, makes just such a conclusion inevi- table:</page><page sequence="17">382 MARGOT NORRIS 1. Josefine is different from the mouse folk because she has music while they are unmusical. 2. When Josefine is dead, she will be unmusical like the mouse folk. 3. The mouse folk, being unmusical, are dead. 4. If Josefine lacks music, like the mouse folk, then she is dead before she dies. Just as music and silence, instead of being logically mutually exclu- sive, become identical elsewhere in the story, so life and death, which should also be logically mutually exclusive, become identical as their difference collapses. Josefine's Hingang is therefore ironic, for it is not a passage or a transition at all. This explains why the mouse folk will not miss her, either when she disappears or when she dies, why their comportment and sentiment is identical toward Josefine alive and Josefine dead, and why Josefine, like her song, is unverlierbar, impossible to lose- War ihr wirkliches Pfeifen nennenswert lauter und lebendiger, als die Erinnerung daran sein wird? War es denn noch bei ihren Lebzeiten mehr als eine bloBe Erinnerung? Hat nicht vielmehr das Volk in seiner Weisheit Josefinens Gesang, eben deshalb, weil er in dieser Art unver- lierbar war, so hoch gestellt? (185) Kafka turned to the animal in his late fiction because the radical- ity of his ontological vision required a negative site of narration: the site of animal being. Kafka deconstructs logic as Joyce deconstructs language. He systematically de-anthropomorphizes language by emptying the conceptual universe of its cultural residue, and by emptying rhetoric of its metaphorical residue. This latter process is the Lacanian version of dream work-a reminder, like Freud's in the Wolf Man case, that the analogy of the unconscious and the infantile must also be extended to the animal. Kafka's technique, finally anti-philosophical insofar as it depends on the dissolution of rational thought, appropriates the negative metaphysics, or deconstructed metaphysics of Derrida's trace. The metaphor of writing forces itself upon Kafka as it does upon Der- rida, for in the track, or Spur, left by the erasure it is possible to have a narration that is simultaneously present and absent. How else could we have the story of Josefine, the singer who is no singer, told by a member of a folk that practices no Geschichte (history or narration) except as a phantom narration, a trace. Finally, if one wished to read Josefine as an autobiographical fable, as Kafka's own swan (or mouse) song, then the final gesture</page><page sequence="18">M L N 383 consigning his works to the flames takes on the significance of that mysterious double cunning which prompts Josefine to stop singing. The parallels between story and biography-Kafka's life-long de- sire for exemption from ordinary labor, his temperamental recoil from an avid, but misunderstanding public, the persistence of loyal supporters, like Brod-suggest that Kafka's motives may have been far more philosophical and ironic than neurotic. Perhaps recog- nizing the trace structure of works that consumed themselves logi- cally and rhetorically in paradox and self-contradiction, he sensed that in their conceptual insubstantiality his texts were already as spectral as ashes and therefore past losing. With superior cunning he may therefore have wanted to surrender to fate, to absorption in the self-contained, undifferentiated, eternally recurring mass of the folk who practice no history or narration and so forget their heroes. Perhaps at the end of his life, like Nietzsche's animal, Kafka forgot to tell us that to be happy we must remember to forget. University of Michigan</page></plain_text>
