<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT OPINION Christian Poetry in Arabia The Arabic language lends itself to poetry more than any other language. It is not generally known, however, that before Mohammed there flourished in Arabia a certain number of Christian poets. In the Expository Times for October and Novem- ber, 1914, Dr. Margaret D. Gibson writes on "Arabic Christian Literature" and quotes several passages from these poets. Although Christianity was wiped out by Islam in Arabia, it must have had some influence on the teaching of Mohammed. To this day the Bedawin of the Sinai penin- sula make the signs of the cross over graves and around their sleeping-places to ward off demons. St. Paul's Contribution to Religious Truth Dr. J. G. James writes on "The The- ology of Paul and the Teaching of Jesus Christ" in the Expository Times for October, 1914. A number of critics draw a striking contrast between the teaching of Jesus Christ and that of Paul. According to the first the main thing is the personal char- acter of the individual; the only pro- pitiation Jesus knows is repentance and conversion. In the soteriology of Paul the central point is a divine act which imparts to mankind a ready-made salvation. Who- ever believes in this theological drama, in these divine acts-the incarnation, the death and resurrection of a celestial being-- receives salvation. The question is not how much of Christ's teaching is to be discovered in Paul's Epistles, but whether the Synoptics themselves were not influenced by Paulin- ism. Dr. James agrees with J. Weiss in regarding the passage II Cor. 5: 16 as a practical admission that Paul did know Jesus personally in his earthly ministry. There is ample evidence in the writings of Paul that he knew at least that Jesus was "a man." Dr. James believes also that Paul was very largely under Hellenistic influences, although the whole of his polem- ical and apologetic methods were those of a rabbi. But he owed nothing either to Hellenic thought or rabbinical tradition for the gospel which he preached. When comparing the teaching of Paul to that of Jesus we must bear in mind that the work and mission of Paul was entirely differ- ent from that of his Master. The theology of Paul was intended for distinctly practical purposes in regulating, instructing, and organizing the churches which he had formed. Perhaps Paul's theology has made it more difficult than otherwise for simple souls to accept the gospel. There are many who think that it would be a distinct gain if men were content to dwell on the essential points of the teaching of Jesus, leaving Paul's theology to specialists. This view is extreme. Meyer has very well expressed what ought to be our attitude when he said,' " 'Back to Jesus from Paul' does not express what is required of us, but our motto should be, 'Back through Paul to Jesus and God.' " Surely the apostle would be the first to concur with this. How to Know the Mind of the Non- Church-going People Rev. Irwin Tucker, editor of the Chris- tian Socialist, writes in the Living Church for November 28 an article on "Forum and Confessional." Mr. Tucker shows how the Roman Catholic priest knows the mind of the people by auricular confession and how, in a number of Protestant churches, prayer-meetings offer a similar opportunity. But in the Episcopal church neither prayer- meeting nor confessional seem to be wanted. We may add that in other Protestant churches the prayer-meetings are not what 46</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT OPINION 47 they used to be. As a result of this many a preacher does not reallyknow the thoughts, perplexities, and troubles of his people and is therefore unable to do his duty as physi- cian of their souls. An open forum offers a means whereby preachers can learn to know the people. The chief difficulty in managing the forums has been that they have been altogether too successful in bringing into the church the members of the underworld, and many "respectable" Christians object to such company. Leprosy in Leviticus In the American Journal of Public Health, Dr. H. W. Hill writes on "Modem Leprosy and Biblical tsaarath." The disease called tsaarath in Lev., chaps. 13-14, is not modern leprosy but lepra. The chief diagnostic points insisted by the regulations of Lev., chaps. 13-14, are that the lesions must be under the skin and enlarge noticeably in the course of one or two weeks. For the case of leprosy proper the lesions are in the skin and increase very slowly. So that if a physician tried to follow the so-called Mosaic Law, he would not only miss all cases of leprosy proper, but treat as leprosy other kinds of skin disorders. The Case for Anthropomorphism Anthropomorphism is a big word de- scribing a very old thing, and it is of the very essence of real religion. Bishop Greer contributes to the Constructive Quarterly for September, I914, "A Study in Anthro- pomorphism." Religion apprehends God not as he is in himself through man; the more really human it is, disclosing and expressing the real human thought, the real human life, the more really divine it is, touching, proving, and setting forth divine reality. Moreover, religion, or rather theological thought in religion, is not differ- ent in this from any other kind of human knowledge. Our knowledge of the outside world is all second hand and comes to us through human consciousness, so that it is conditioned by the category of the human thought in us. All knowledge is anthro- pomorphic. Bishop Greer gives a modern exposition of the old ontological argument and shows how God is implicit in human thought. This is the great lesson of the Incarnation; the Incarnation is also a pro- cess, the evolution of humanity. Human life is not human life as yet; we shall see and know what man is when He who came once into human life shall have come again, and when all human life together shall be the incarnation of God. Christianity and Military Service European magazines give a large part of their contents to the war. The Revue de thlologie et de philosophie of September, 1914, a Swiss publication, contains an article by Mr. H. F. Secretan on "Le Christianisme des premiers siecles et le service militaire." The teaching of the primitive church was very clear; it con- demned military service. There were many Christians in the army of the Caesars, but probably as the result of the persecutions. Volunteers were lacking for the legions, and slaves and Christians were pressed into military service. From the point of view of imperialism Christianity was dangerous: St. Cyprian was beheaded for the same reason that Ferrer, the Spanish anarchist, was shot in Barcelona. The hostile atti- tude of the Christians toward military service, their unwillingness to bear arms in time of peace, their refusal to shed blood in time of war, must have been one of the great causes of the persecutions. The Appendix of the Fourth Gospel Principal A. E. Garvie, continuing his "Notes on the Fourth Gospel," considers in the Expositor for November, 1914, the two last chapters of the Gospel according to St. John. The appendix (John, chap. 21) is</page><page sequence="3">48 THE BIBLICAL WORLD not the work of the same writer. The hyperbole of vs. 23 contrasts most unfavor- ably with the sober conclusion of the pre- ceding chapter. The writer of the appendix was probably ignorant of the tradition of St. John's early death and possibly con- fused it with a tradition concerning a dis- ciple of Jesus, also called John, who lived to a great age in Ephesus. Egyptian Ethics In the Sphinx for August, I914, Mr. C. Autran writes on "La morale des Egyp- tiens." While a few tribes of the despised nomads of Arabia have given to the world the Bible and the Koran, the highly civil- ized Egyptians, who so despised the Beda- win, have had very little influence on the religious evolution of humanity. Hebrew and Christian ethics have a somewhat harsh and austere conception of goodness and happiness. This is due largely to the problem of evil, so difficult for monotheists. The Egyptians, on the contrary, being polytheists, could easily solve this problem. Their belief in magic must have made life easier for them; the judgment of a stern god had no terror for the Egyptian, who knew that he could provide charms against all dangers to his soul. No direct influence of Egyptian religion upon Hebrew religion can be demonstrated. However, out of the ten commandments six are found in Egyp- tian texts centuries before the Decalogue was written: these six precepts are all ethical. Moreover, Egyptian ethics was more developed than Hebrew ethics; it enjoined the duty of kindness and sincerity. The weakness of Egyptian ethics was its lack of manliness. National life was cen- tered in the Pharaoh. Despotism crushed the individual. Was Jesus an Anarchist? In the Interpreter for October, 1914, Mr. J. B. Grant writes on "Rabbi Jesus-Jesus Anarchist." Jesus was given commonly the title of rabbi. He did not resent it. Therefore his work must have been con- sidered by his contemporaries as that of an interpreter of the Law of Moses. Like every rabbi, Jesus gave an unqualified assent to the integrity and authority of the Law (Matt. 5:18; Luke 16:17). His methods of interpretation and discussion were conservative. His maxim might have been, "Back to Moses." It seems quite a paradox that Jesus was at the same time another teacher who certainly treated the Law as obsolete and proposed to substitute for it a principle of moral life which may very well be described as anarchical. This paradox is reflected in every man and in the history of the church, where authority expresses itself through law and duty and freedom expresses itself in aspiration, inno- vation, and inquiry. Is There a Crisis in the Criticism of the Pentateuch ? In the Neue kirchliche Zeitschrift for October, 1914, Dr. E. Koenig writes on "Die gegenwaertige Krisis in der Penta- teuchkritik." J. Dahse heralds the downfall of the Wellhausen theory of the compo- sition of the Pentateuch. Koenig shows that Dahse's assertions are entirely un- founded. We cannot be quite sure of the reading that the translators of the Septua- gint had before them. The Hebrew text of the Old Testament remains the basis of our scientific study of the text. Dahse's peric- ope theory does not stand. The so-called "crisis" has not materialized. The Doctrine of Satan Half a century ago the fear of the devil was instilled into children's minds. Now Christian parents and educators like to dwell more on the love of God. In the Interpreter for October, 1914, Dr. Kennett studies the doctrine of "Satan." The word Satan is not a proper name, but means simply "adversary." He is in the</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT OPINION 49 Old Testament the personification of the trials which distinguish the good from the bad, the true from the false. This con- ception is found in the words of Jesus to Simon: "Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat." Does Protestantism Restrict Population? This rather startling question is discussed in the October Hibbert Journal by Meyrick Booth. His paper is based on statistical in- quiries, and is a good illustration of the fact that while figures do not lie, they do not necessarily tell all the truth, or show us the real causes of problems. The author has no constructive suggestions, and his article is interesting only for the material presented. Those English towns which have shown the smallest decrease in birth-rate are, in general, those in which either Jews or Roman Catholics, or both, are most numerous. Liverpool, Salford, Manchester, and Glas- gow are cities containing an exceptionally large proportion of Irish Catholics, with a fairly strong Jewish element; and the seven most prolific London boroughs are just those which contain the largest percentage of Roman Catholics and Jews. The birth-rate in the Lancashire cotton towns has, in gen- eral, fallen off greatly in recent years; but the phenomenon has been much less marked in the city of Preston than in other places. It is precisely in Preston, however, that the Roman Catholic church is stronger than anywhere else in the cotton centers. The average birth-rate among Protes- tants in England and Wales is about 24 per thousand. But the average birth-rate among Roman Catholics in these countries is 38. These figures help us to understand the steady numerical progress of Catholicism in Britain. A birth-rate of this kind will insure the ascent of Romanism to a predomi- nant position in Great Britain. The declin- ing membership of most of the Protestant bodies is easily explained by the rapid diminution of their birth-rates in recent years. Other countries tell the same story. The most prolific parts of France are those in which the people have retained their alle- giance to the traditional church. In Ger- many, there has been for some years a steady increase in the Catholic element. In the United States and Canada, the Catholic rate of increase outstrips the Protestant. And, taking the world as a whole, the Protestant nations are being left far behind in the gen- eral growth of population. The new terri- tories that have been opened up of recent years are being occupied to an ever- increasing extent by stocks which show little disposition to be influenced by modern Protestantism. The Swing of the Roman Catholic Pendulum That the Roman church has passed an- other cycle of its evolution, and has now swung back toward liberalism and democ- racy, is the claim which seems to be sus- tained by Giovanni Pioli, a Roman Catholic writer, in the October Contemporary Review. The author was forced to resign from an ecclesiastical position during the crusade against Modernism a few years ago, in the reign of the late pope, Pius X. His article is likely to be overshadowed by current his- tory; but it is closely related to the issues of the war, and should not be missed by re- ligious leaders and thinkers. Mons. Pioli says that in order to under- stand the significance of the election of the present pope, Benedict XV (Della Chiesa), we must retrace the genetic factors of a gigantic duel into which Chiesa was drawn from the beginning of his career in the Roman church. The events are closely in- volved in the earlier waves of the great martial struggle now shaking civilization. The Roman church, like other social in- stitutions, is swayed by the tug and pull of opposed interests. Going back as far as</page><page sequence="5">50 THE BIBLICAL WORLD 1887, we find that a reconciliation between Germany and the Vatican had brought to a close the Kulturkampf, or religious war, between the Kaiser and the Pope. At that time the church was dominated by forces which not only sought reconciliation with Germany, but the substitution, in the church, of aristocratic, Prussian influence and spirit in place of the democratic spirit of France. One of the leading representa- tives of the dominant party was the prelate Galimberti. French diplomacy, however, not only frustrated the election of Galimberti to the position of papal secretary of state, but when Pope Leo XIII proposed conciliation with Italy, France imposed on him, under the threat of denouncing the Concordat, the famous "Retractation." The same Gallic influence forced the election of Cardinal Rampolla as secretary of state. At this point, we get our first glimpse of the present occupant of the papal throne in the person of Chiesa, who was the right hand of Ram- polla. The visit of Kaiser William II to Leo XIII proved a failure. The Vatican openly adhered to the French republican government. Rampolla had conquered. The church was oriented toward democracy, toward revival of culture among the clergy, and toward a certain degree of tolerance for liberalism. At the death of Leo XIII, however, the pendulum swung back. The influence of Austria opposed the election of Rampolla as pope, and placed in the chair of St. Peter a narrow-minded, headstrong, pious peasant, who thus became the late Pope Pius X. This Venetian cleric was, by birth and edu- cation, a natural adversary of the liberal policy of Leo XIII, and a warm sympathizer with the German and Austrian emperors. To give effect to the new order, Cardinal Merry del Val became secretary of state. The conservative policy of Pius X, which was intended to "restore all things in Christ," led to the loss of France as a Catho- lic nation, the alienation of Catholic cultured classes in all countries, the failure to rally the masses everywhere, the general unrest and dejection of the Roman clergy, and the exodus of thousands of Modernist priests. No laudatory descriptions of the work of Pius X can suffice to obscure the fact that this pope dealt a body blow to the interests of the Roman church throughout the world. Such being the posture of affairs, the death of Pius in the early days of the war gave the opposition a chance to rally. Although Rampolla had passed away, his disciple and assistant, Chiesa, was living in the obscurity of the See of Bologna, where no influence can be exerted on the general direction of Roman policy. From this place in the background of the church the votes of the cardinals brought Mons. Chiesa to the papal throne. While the work of the new administra- tion cannot, of course, be predicted with accuracy, Benedict XV, a different type of man from Pius X, will do much to restrain the precipitate rushing of the church toward ruin. Under him the Roman church may still play, if not the whole, at least a good part, in the task of building up a new humanity.</page></plain_text>
