<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN By JOSEPH FRANK NO other work of Dostoevsky's poses so many and such formidable problems for the critic as does The Devils (more familiarly known in English under the less accurate title of The Possessed). To begin with the most obvious matters, The Devils contains the richest assortment of comic parodies and satirical caricatures that Dostoevsky ever assembled between the covers of one volume; and unless these are noted and taken into critical account, one can hardly do justice to Dostoev sky's dominating artistic purpose. More subtly, the very concep tion of the book requires Dostoevsky to present aborted or de formed versions of doctrines and attitudes to which he himself is passionately committed; and this has led to endless misunder standings both about his own convictions and about the signifi cance of the novel. Finally, The Devils is further complicated by its tangled genesis?Dostoevsky changed his idea of the theme after a good part of it was written?and also by the refusal of Katkov, the editor of the journal in which The Devils was being serialized, to print the chapter containing Stavrogin's confession. The book must, of course, be interpreted primarily in terms of what Dostoevsky actually succeeded in getting on the page; but this can sometimes be clearly seen only if we are aware of the unwritten novel whose outlines can be dis cerned in the history of the written one. Originally, Dostoevsky's first grasp of his subject was purely satiric and caricatural; he had intended to concentrate on the comic confusion of the Liberal and Idealist generation of the 1840's confronted with the disastrous consequences of their own ideas in the Nihilists of the later 1860's. At this stage of his con ception Dostoevsky referred to the novel as a "pamphlet", and said that he was resolved to sacrifice "art" to "tendentiousness".</page><page sequence="2">JOSEPH FRANK 661 "Art" for Dostoevsky always meant the serious treatment of a basic moral conflict?a conflict which, whatever its point of depar ture in the contemporary socio-cultural situation, far transcended this context in the range of its human implications. In The Devils, however, Dostoevsky did not set out to portray any such inner discord or dilemma from the inside 3 he thought he would limit himself only to castigating the beliefs and principles of the radi cals (as well as the frivolity and stupidity of Russian "educated" society) with withering scorn. The narrative technique of the novel was thus conceived of very early in terms appropriate to this idea?as, that is, the report of a relatively detached observer, a provincial chronicler, setting down a series of unusual and gro tesquely horrible events. (Among the notes for an early draft, there is a phrase in italics, probably a provisional subtitle, in which the book is called: "Extracts from a provincial chronicle".) By the choice of such a narrator Dostoevsky was able to "distance" himself very effectively from his characters?he could view them externally, retain his freedom to comment, and, at the same time, keep the narrative focused on the public and social nature of the events depicted. It is well known that, having already begun to write according to this original plan, Dostoevsky was confronted with a crisis when Stavrogin erupted into the manuscript as a major figure. Stavro gin was unquestionably a "tragic" character, and this meant that he would ordinarily have been treated internally and psycho logically; but in this case Dostoevsky did not fundamentally change his narrative perspective. Stavrogin too is seen completely from the outside except in the confession-scene; and even here he "confesses" by means of a document which interposes itself between his consciousness in the scene and the reader. In other words, we are never inside Stavrogin, living with the life of his feelings, as we are inside the underground man Raskolnikov or Prince Myshkin. To be sure, neither Stavrogin nor his two main interlocutors, Shatov and Kirillov, are satirized or parodied; but</page><page sequence="3">662 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN while their obsessive quest for an absolute value has more in herent dignity than the posturings of Stepan Trofimovich, or the machinations of Peter Verkhovensky and his "quintet", they are not presented in a radically different fashion. All the characters are seen from the outside, and their consciousnesses (as distinct from their emotive responses to particular situations) are rarely if ever dramatized directly at any length. Hence the book pre serves a considerable degree of artistic unity, despite the marked differences in tone between the satirical and non-satirical sections. Dostoevsky's handling of his narrative, all the same, is by no means perfect or consistent from a purely technical point of view. An unregenerate Jamesian could well quarrel with his failure to make the chronicler an integral part of the story; and the feeble indication of the narrator's infatuation from afar with Liza Tushin only makes matters worse rather than better. Moreover, the "voice" of the chronicler fades away entirely in certain scenes where he is not present, and about which we are simply told that he has gathered information. "... I will pass on," he writes at one point, "to the description of the succeeding incidents of my chronicle, writing, so to say, with full knowledge, and describing things as they became known afterwards, and are clearly seen today." It is quite clear, however, that the chronicler could not possibly have learned the exact words, the physical movements, and the inner responses of the characters as they are represented in these scenes: Dostoevsky has simply substituted an objective narrator here for the eye-witness account of the chronicler. There are, as a result, really two narrators in The Devils, who alternate with each other and are hitched together rather apologeti cally with remarks like the one just quoted. Despite the inconsistencies of this procedure, Dostoevsky was nonetheless very well advised to run the artistic risks that it en gendered. For it has the great advantage of allowing him to narrow and to widen his focus on the action easilv and at will, and to step back from the intensity of the dramatic closeups to</page><page sequence="4">JOSEPH FRANK 663 the sweeping and summarizing commentary of the chronicler whenever he wishes to do so. And while an objective, third person narrator might have given him a similar freedom, he would have been forced to sacrifice the effects he obtains with his chronicler. No third-person narrator could have had the same inflection as the chronicler's "voice"; and this "voice" plays an important part in controlling the effect of the book, to which it imparts a special quality and atmosphere. The "voice" of the chronicler, in the first place, is that of a "moderate liberal", who sympathizes with progress and im provement and is against both the extreme reactionaries and the extreme radicals. It is the voice of the average educated Russian, a good citizen and a faithful subject, for whom both the hopes of Peter Verkhovensky and the fears of Stepan Trofimovich are nightmare and fantasy; they are the extravagances and excres cences that come and go on the surface of Russian life, but which cannot possibly have any permanent effect. Moreover, the chronicler is a friend and neighbor of the main figures?a some what gossipy and malicious but fundamentally good-hearted soul, who wavers between exposure and apology. He knows the petty and excusable personal weaknesses that lie at the root of so much of the chaos he depicts; and his comments thus constantly reduce the turbulent events of the book to eccentric and isolated manifestations. In this way their importance is continually being softened and muted, and their scale tends to be reduced to the level of personal fallibility and social tittle-tattle. Finally, the constant reappearance of the "voice" of the chronicler, taking up the thread after the hallucinatory intensity of the dramatic epi sodes, breaks their spell and recalls to the reader that all this is part of a past now happily done with. It thus throws a certain veil of epic serenity even over the hecatomb of murders and deaths that make this book the goriest of Dostoevsky's novel tragedies.</page><page sequence="5">664 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN II Dostoevsky immediately establishes the social and historical perspective of his theme by the leisurely and superbly ironical portrait of Stepan Trofimovich Verkhovensky, the Liberal Ideal ist of the 1840's. Stepan Trofimovich is here portrayed against the background of a brilliantly parodistic evocation of Russian culture from the 1830's to the point at which the novel begins in 1869-1870. Almost every concrete cultural detail of this masterly mosaic is taken from one or another actual source, whether an event or a text; but it would be tedious and, for our purposes, critically unenlightening, to identify them all.1 More important is to note that the chronicler's account of Stepan Trofimovich's career is an excellent example of how he deflates and reduces whatever he describes. In this case the reduction is accomplished both by the vagueness of his recollection of Stepan Trofimovich's works, and by the burlesque heightening of lan guage when he speaks about them. Stepan Trofimovich's famous article, he writes, contained "the beginning of a very profound investigation into the causes, I believe, of the extraordinary moral nobility of certain knights at a certain epoch or something of that nature. Some lofty and exceptionally noble idea was maintained in it, anyway." The choice of such a subject, of course, also de fines the sublime elevation of Stepan Trofimovich's ideals, which form such a pathetic and touching contrast to the actual circum stances of his life. A similar effect is obtained by the chronicler's account of Stepan Trofimovich's inflammatory prose-poem, which was written in the style of the romantic epic popular in France during the 1830's. Manuscript copies of this effusion "had been passed round a circle consisting of two poetical amateurs and one student", and aThe job of spotting Dostoevsky's sources has been very well done in Russian scholarship. A good summary of its results may be found in the article by F. I. Yevnin, "Roman Besi". Tvorchestvo Dostoevskogo, ed. by N. L. Stepanov, Moscow, 1959, pp. 215-264.</page><page sequence="6">JOSEPH FRANK 665 it is described as "some sort of an allegory in lyrical-dramatic form, recalling the second part of Faust". The extremely funny parody of such a work is too long to quote entire; but the conclud ing passage must be cited as the first suggestion of the book's sym bolism. Then a youth of indescribable beauty rides in on a black steed, and an immense multitude of all nations follow him. The youth represents death, for whom all the peoples are yearning. And finally, in the last scene we are suddenly shown the Tower of Babel, and certain athletes at last finish building it with a song of new hope, and when at length they complete the topmost pinnacle, the lord (of Olympus, let us say) takes flight in a comic fashion, and man, grasping the situation and seizing his place, at once begins a new life with a new insight into things. For all its humor, this parody contains the basic theme of the book and foreshadows the appearance of Stavrogin. He too is of an "indescribable beauty"; he too is death and not life; he too is followed, if not by a multitude of all nations, then by the multitude of all those who look to him for inspiration. He too believes that man can replace?not of course the lord of Olym pus, who has nothing to do with the Tower of Babel, but the God of the Old Testament and His Son of the New. He is the pretender and the impostor to the throne of God, just as Death in the poem aspires to be the Source of Life; and everything that stems from him is thus marked with the seal of supreme falsity and deception and leads to Death. It is a counterfeit and fraudu lent facsimile of the Truth; and this symbolism of the usurper, the pretender, the impostor runs through every aspect of the book, underlying and linking together its action in a way that has generally escaped attention. Nobody, to be sure, is more of an impostor?more of an en dearing and charming old fake?than Stepan Trofimovich; even hostile critics of The Devils, enraged at its lampooning of the</page><page sequence="7">666 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN radicals, greeted his appearance as a triumph. Dostoevsky paints him with such an overflowing abundance of traits that it is diffi cult to do justice to them all; but each reinforces the comic dis crepancy between his rhetorical postures and his practical per formances. To take only one example, the lazy, self-coddling Stepan Trofimovich, who is always on the point of beginning to write his great masterpiece (but somehow never quite gets started), is very fond of indulging in a little homily on the vir tues and importance of work for the Russian character. "For the last twenty years I've been sounding the tocsin and calling to work. ... I shall hold on to the bell-rope till they start tolling for my requiem," he declaims impressively to his deferential au dience. His tender and frustrating relationship with his domineering patroness, based on a pattern of alternating moods of exasperation and adoration on both sides, is irresistibly funny broad comedy; and it shows, incidentally, that Dostoevsky could use his famous love-hate situation in whatever key was required by his theme. Moreover, despite his personal loathing for the Nihilism of Peter Verkhovensky, Dostoevsky does not fail to let him puncture his father's self-protective poses with deadly accuracy. The pitiless realism of the Nihilist, always viewing everything in terms of the crudest self-interest, time and again reveals the skeleton in Stepan Trofimovich's beautifully bedecked closet; but this only serves to make the fickle old Idealist even more sympathetic and appealing. For whatever the material basis of his existence, he has never exploited it cynically or basely; and he has always been aware that he is unworthy of the great ideals that he proclaims and reveres. Stepan Trofimovich, in other words, has never allowed his conscience to become blunted or dulled; and this, for Dostoevsky, is always the key to salvation. This first chapter not only establishes the historical framework within which the action will be placed, but also serves a more discreet aesthetic function. These pages have a static quality</page><page sequence="8">JOSEPH FRANK 667 that transmits an impression of the calm tranquillity and lulling routine of the pattern of life that would soon be upset by the incursion of "the devils", who gradually filter into the provincial town from outside to shake it to its very roots. The chronicler, significantly, stresses the perfectly innocuous, commonplace, and almost ritual nature of the gatherings of Stepan Trofimovich's group of visitors and friends, some of whose members will soon serve as the nucleus of Peter Verkhovensky's "quintet". "At one time it was repeated about the town that our little circle was a hotbed of Nihilism, profligacy, and godlessness. . . . And yet we did nothing but indulge in the most harmless, agreeable, typi cally Russian, light-hearted liberal chatter." Life would have continued to go on very much as before without the external stimulus provided by Peter Verkhovensky's determination to change words into deeds; and the gradually tightening web of the plot, with its accelerating tempo and intricate network of con cealed relations, communicates an almost physical sense of this gradual invasion of a long-established order by occult forces sur reptitiously taking over its destiny. In this respect the undramatic and (for Dostoevsky) unusually slow opening chapter works to set off by contrast the tension of the rest of the book, and to provide an appropriate formal analogue for the thematic action. Ill Following the opening chapter devoted to Stepan Trofimo vich, we are introduced next to Stavrogin; and this is the point at which, in my view, Dostoevsky's organization of his plot damages the effectiveness of his symbolic pattern. Nikolai Stavrogin, up to the age of sixteen, has been the pupil of Stepan Trofimovich, who was entrusted with his education. This makes a Liberal Idealist of the 1840's the spiritual progenitor of a Byronic type, a blood-brother of Eugene Onegin and Lermontov's Pechorin, associated in Russian culture with the 1820's and the 1830's. How can one account for this peculiar feature of the book? 8</page><page sequence="9">668 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN With the aid of Dostoevsky's notebooks, it is not too difficult to reconstruct what occurred. Initially, the ideological center of the novel was to have been the relation between Stepan Trofimovich and his son, Peter. In this version, the plot contained a colorless character called the "Prince", a former pupil of Stepan Trofimo vich's who had no particular socio-cultural function. The "Prince" then later emerged as Stavrogin, and replaced Stepan Trofimovich as the thematic center; it was the Byronic Stavrogin who, historically, had indeed been the original source of all the foreign id?ologies that had infected the ailing body of Russia with madness. Trying^ though, to preserve as much of his old manu script as possible after Stavrogin appeared, Dostoevsky failed to alter the plot-pattern to fit his new thematic conception; and the result is an unfortunate confusion that obscures the real meaning of his symbolic chronology. Stavrogin's Byronism loses much of its historical point when he is turned into Stepan Trofimovich's disciple; and so does the nature of Stavrogin's relation to Kirillov and Shatov, which can be adequately understood only in historical-symbolic terms. Dostoevsky accurately underlines the heritage of Romantic sensibility that linked the generations of Stepan Trofimo vich and Stavrogin; but he anachronistically requires Stepan Trofimovich to bear the onus of having exercised a morbid and unhealthy influence on his youthful and impressionable charge. "More than once he awakened his ten-or-eleven year old friend at night, simply to pour out his wounded feelings and weep before him, or to tell him some family secret, without noticing that this was totally impermissible." The tutor com municated all the moral uncertainty and instability of his own character to his unfortunate pupil, without providing anything positive to counteract their unsettling effects; the result was to leave an aching emptiness at the center of Stavrogin's being. "Stepan Trofimovich succeeded in reaching the deepest chords in his pupil's heart, and had aroused in him a first vague sensa</page><page sequence="10">JOSEPH FRANK 669 tion of that eternal, sacred longing which some elect souls, once having tasted and discovered it, will then never exchange for a cheap gratification. (There are some connoisseurs who prize this longing more than the most complete satisfaction of it, if such were possible)." This passage both defines Stavrogin as being emotionally engaged in the quest for an absolute of some kind, and also suggests the perversity springing from his lack of any positive goal. His quest is a spiritual experimentation totally preoccupied with itself, totally enclosed within the ego, and hence incapable of self-surrender to the absolute that it is presumably seeking. All through this first evocation of Stavrogin, Dostoevsky ac centuates the pure gratuity of his scandalous behavior, the im possibility of explaining it by any ordinary and commonplace motives. Stavrogin is not simply exhibiting the customary inso lence of his class and personal position when he lives the riotous life of a Guards officer; this is not merely the "cheap gratifica tion" of an overbearing social vanity, or of an uncontrollable itch for sensual pleasures. There is something mysterious about Stav rogin's violence, particularly about his taste for self-degradation, that transcends the norm; he is not, as Stepan Trofimovich con solingly suggests to his mother, a young Prince Harry out of Shakespeare's "immortal chronicle", sowing his wild oats and rubbing elbows with the people before settling down to assume his rightfully exalted position in society. The sheer gratuitousness of his defiance of social convention is stressed even more strongly in the episodes that scandalize his hometown on his return. He suddenly pulls the nose of a harm less old gentleman who has been in the habit of asserting, "No, you can't lead me by the nose!"; on the spur of the moment he publicly kisses Liputin's pretty wife with genuine passion; called in by his distant relative, the Governor of the province, for some explanations, he surpasses himself by biting the Governor's ear. All these incidents suggest Stavrogin's refusal to bridle or check</page><page sequence="11">670 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN his impulses in any way, his rejection of any internal or external restraints on the absolute autonomy of his self-will; and when he goes mad with an attack of "brain fever", this, as the chronicler remarks, was thought by some to be "neither here nor there" so far as explaining his actions was concerned. The first physical description of Stavrogin given by the chroni cler pinpoints his strange appearance of indefinable artificiality? an appearance that obviously derives from his symbolic function. "His hair was of a peculiarly intense black, his light-colored eyes were peculiarly light and calm, his complexion was peculiarly soft and white, the red in his cheeks was too bright and clear, his teeth were like pearls and his lips like coral?one would have thought the very acme of beauty, yet at the same time somehow repellent. It was said that his face suggested a mask. . . ." Stavrogin's mask like beauty reminds one of the vampires and ghouls of Gothic fictional mythology; like them he is a living corpse, whose un earthly beauty is the deceptive fa?ade behind which festers the horror of evil and corruption. Several years later, however, when the chronicler observes him face-to-face again, a change has occurred. "Now?now, I don't know why he impressed me at once as absolutely, incontestably beautiful, so that no one could have said that his face was like a mask"; now he seemed to have "the light of some new idea in his eyes". This "new idea" is clearly that of his decision to reject and transcend his past, to humiliate himself publicly and sincerely by acknowledging his marriage to Marya Lebyadkin and confessing his violation of Matryosha. By seeking forgiveness and absolu tion, he hopes to save himself from the madness that he feels to be his impending fate. On the purely moral-personal level, Stavrogin's r?le as a character is defined by his despairing struggle to triumph over the egoism of his self-will and to attain a state of genuine humility. The first overt manifestation of this "new idea" is the self-control that he exhibits under the provocation of Shatov's blow; but in the same scene he lies about his relation to</page><page sequence="12">JOSEPH FRANK 671 the crippled Marya, which he wishes to reveal only under the conditions of his own choosing. And this is the first evidence for Tikhon's later judgment that Stavrogin's egoism, far from having been conquered by his new resolution, has taken on its subtlest form of all as a carefully staged martyrdom of contempt. The comments of the chronicler at the end of this scene, who compares Stavrogin both with a legendary Decembrist of the 1820's and with Lermontov, try to compensate for his his torical anomalousness and, at the same time, throw further light on his inner desiccation and emotional apathy. In the past, such "rapacious" Byronic types?as Apollon Grigoriev2 had called them?had at least enjoyed the consciousness of their own superiority and strength; but while Stavrogin would have per formed the same feats from which they derived pleasure, it would have been "without the slightest thrill of enjoyment, languidly, listlessly, even with ennui and entirely from unpleasant neces sity". Stavrogin had even more "malignancy" than such gentle men of the past, "but his malignancy was cold, calm, and, if one may say so, rational?therefore, the most revolting and terrible possible." All the springs of human feeling of whatever kind have dried up in Stavrogin; his demonism is that of a total rationalism which, once having emptied life of all significance and values, can no longer make any direct, instinctive response even to its most primitive solicitations. Byron's Manfred has different reasons for his despair with life (his crime of incest, which re sembles Stavrogin's violation of innocence, is at least a crime of passion), but his self-characterization accurately applies to Stavro gin as well : aApollon Grigoriev was the best Russian critic of the mid-nineteenth century, a close friend of Dostoevsky's, and an important contributor to Dostoevsky's maga zines, Time and Epoch. He developed a view of Russian culture as a conflict between "rapacious" Byronic types imported from the West, and indigenous Russian "meek" types.</page><page sequence="13">672 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN . . . Good, or evil, life, Powers, passions, all I see in other beings, Have been to me as rain unto the sands, .... I have no dread, And feel the curse to have no natural fear, Nor fluttering throb, that beats with hopes or wishes, Or lurking love of something on the earth. IV The action in the first four chapters of Part II, which concen trate on Stavrogin as he makes a round of visits to Kirillov, Shatov, and the Lebyadkins, indirectly illuminates both his historical-symbolic significance and the tragedy of his yearning for an unattainable absolution and humility. The first two figures represent an aspect of himself that he has discarded, but which has now become transformed into one or another ideological "devil" permanently obsessing his spiritual disciples. In the case of Kirillov, this "devil" is the temptation to self-deification logi cally deriving from the atheistic humanism of Feuerbach. "The turning-point of history," Feuerbach had written in The Essence of Christianity, "will be the moment when man becomes aware that the only God of man is man himself. Homo homini Deus.v There is an obvious echo of this famous declaration in the scene between Kirillov and the chronicler in Part I, when Kirillov re marks that history will be divided into two parts, "from the gorilla to the annihilation of God, and from the annihilation of God to . . . ['To the gorilla?' ironically interjects the narrator] ... to the transformation of the earth and of man physically. Man will be God and be transformed physically." Kirillov is one of Dostoevsky's most remarkable creations, who? like Raskolnikov, displays his intimate understanding of the moral afflatus inspiring so many of the radicals whose concrete political aims he abhorred. A secular saint, Kirillov's whole being has been consumed by a need for self-sacrifice; and his part in the</page><page sequence="14">JOSEPH FRANK 673 plot-action is determined by this need. Having resolved to take his own life, he has offered to do so at the moment that would most aid the "cause" as represented by Peter Verkhoven sky; and Peter plans to use this magnanimous resolution to cover the murder of Shatov. This same need for sacrifice is evident in Kirillov's original decision, which is taken out of a desire to free man from the pain and fear of death. God, Kirillov believes as a good Feuerbachian, is nothing but the projected image of this pain and fear; and by committing suicide solely with the aim of expressing the highest capacity of man's self-will?-solely to free man from a God who is nothing but his fear?Kirillov is con vinced he will initiate the era of the man-god predicted by Feuer bach. Kirillov's suicide will thus be a martyrdom for mankind, but a martyrdom which reverses the significance of that of Christ; rather than testifying to the reality and existence of God, it will mark His definitive elimination from human consciousness. With a daring that has created a great deal of confusion, Dos toevsky does not hesitate to endow Kirillov with many of the attributes of Prince Myshkin?his love for children, his ecstatic affirmation of life, his eschatological apprehension of the end of time. The symbolism of the book, it should be remembered, re quires Stavrogin always to inspire a deformed and distorted image of the Truth?but an image which resembles its original as closely and uncannily as Stavrogin's "mask" resembles healthy human beauty. Hence Dostoevsky gives Kirillov the "mask" of Myshkin's apocalyptic intuitions and feelings, while revealing the monstrosities that result when these religious aspirations, di vorced from a faith in Christ, become exclusively secular and sub jective ideas. Kirillov's deification of Man leads to his own self-destruction, as well as to that of all mankind ("it will be the same to live or not to live") ; his conviction that the Advent has already arrived deludes him into denying the existence of evil ("everything is good") ; and he sees no difference between wor shiping a sacred ikon or "a spider crawling along a wall". Stav</page><page sequence="15">674 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN rogin's demonism is refracted in Kirillov through a religious sensi bility haunted, like Ippolit Terentyev in The Idiot, by the loss of Christ; and his natural goodness makes him oblivious and personally immune to the horrible consequences of his own doctrines. Stavrogin, though, has lived through other possi bilities, and he indicates the most crucial of them in his question: ". . . and if anyone insults and outrages [a] little girl, is that good?" It is little wonder that, throughout this scene, he regards Kirillov "with disdainful compassion", though, as Dostoevsky carefully adds, "there was no mockery in his eyes." This dialogue with Kirillov is followed by a parallel scene with Shatov; and here again Dostoevsky uses some of his own most cherished thoughts and feelings to dramatize Stavrogin's "mask". Just as Stavrogin had inspired Kirillov with an atheistic human ism based on the supremacy of reason, so he has inspired Shatov, at the same time, with a Slavophilism founded on the very op posite principle. "Reason has never had the power to define good and evil," Shatov says, repeating Stavrogin's teaching, "or even to distinguish between good and evil, even approximately; on the contrary, it has always mixed them up in a disgraceful and pitiful way; science has even given the solution by the fist." The distinction between good and evil can never come from reason but only from the irrational, from religion. "There has never been a nation without a religion, that is, without an idea of good and evil." For a Russian, the idea of good and evil can only come from the Orthodox faith, and Shatov accepts Stavrogin's dictum that "a man who was not Orthodox could not be Russian." Here then, growing directly out of Stavrogin's preachments, is the metaphysical-religious essence of the two ideologies (Westernism and Slavophilism) that succeeded the Russian Byronism of the 1830's. The relation between Shatov and Stavrogin is much more com plex, and much more difficult to define accurately, than that be tween Stavrogin and Kirillov. It is quite clear that Kirillov's</page><page sequence="16">JOSEPH FRANK 675 attempt literally to incarnate the man-god can lead only to self destruction; and this of course represents the demonic and Luci ferian aspect of Stavrogin's personality (but only in a morally elevated form). Shatov, on the other hand, represents the need and the search for faith that is also an essential aspect of Stavro gin, the need that is leading him to confess and to repent his crimes. Moreover, the effect of Stavrogin on Shatov has been the very opposite of his effect on Kirillov; he has helped Shatov to break with his revolutionary past, and has imbued him with the Messianic idea of the Russians as a "god-bearing people" destined to regenerate the world. Stavrogin's influence has thus led Shatov along the path that Dostoevsky could only consider to be that of salvation; but according to the symbolic pattern of the book, this path too must be blocked by the fatality of Stavrogin's doom. To understand why this should be so, it is necessary to know that Shatov's ideas are very largely taken from N. Ya. Danilev sky's book Russia and Eurofe, which had recently expounded a new "scientific" and Pan-Slavic version of Slavophilism. Dos toevsky's enthusiasm for Danilevsky's predictions of the future triumph of an impending, world-wide Slavic civilization did not prevent him from noticing that Danilevsky's ideas lacked a re ligious foundation.3 Moreover, Dostoevsky had also come round to considering the overtly religious Old Slavophilism of Kireev sky and Khomiakov, despite its emphasis on Orthodoxy, as an artificial, Western-imported substitute for the genuine simplicity and spontaneity of the people's faith. "The Slavophil," Dostoev ^ 3In an important letter explaining the meaning of his title The Devils, and discus sing the symbolism of the book (9/21 October, 1870), Dostoevsky writes: "The en tire mission of Russia lies in Orthodoxy, in the light from the East, which will flow to the blinded Humanity in the West who have lost Christ. All the misfortunes of Europe, all, all. without any exception, have arisen because they lost Christ with the Roman Church, and then decided they could get along without Christ. Now just imagine, my dear friend, that even in Russians of such a stature as, for example, the author of Russia and Europe?\ have not encountered this thought about Russia, i.e., of its exclusively Orthodox mission for humanity." This letter indicates how closely Dostoievsky's reservations about Danilevsky were linked to the creation of The Devils.</page><page sequence="17">676 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN sky writes in his notes for The Devilsy "thinks that he can manage solely thanks to the natural attributes of the Russian people, but without Orthodoxy one will not manage at all, no attributes will do anything if the world has lost faith." On the same page, in a speech not included in the text, Shatov calls Slavophilism "an aristocratic whim"; and he adds: "They [the Slavophils]will never be able to believe directly." This idea is finally given to Stepan Trofimovich, who says much the same thing?and here he certainly speaks for the author?when he declares that "Shatov believes by forcing himself to&gt; like a Moscow Slavophil." (Italics in text.) Objectively, Dostoevsky translates his disagreement with Danilevsky into Shatov's view (which again smacks of Feuerbach) that God is "the synthetic personality" of a people ?a view which reduces religion to nationalism. Subjec tively, Stavrogin forces Shatov to admit that he does not yet believe in God, and hence cannot muster the simple and un questioning faith that would infuse his ideas with the inner fire of true emotional commitment. It is significant that the name of Christ is never once mentioned in their dialogue; nor do Shatov's convictions contain any trace of the note of love and universal reconciliation which, for Dostoevsky, was the essence of Russia's "mission". Stavrogin has thus here again inspired a mutilated version of the Truth, which falls short of its ultimate grounding in true re ligious faith?even though he knows abstractly that such faith is the only answer to the chaos of his unlimited freedom. Shatov diagnoses the malady afflicting them both in a key speech which helps to place them in Dostoevsky's perspective: 'You're an atheist [Shatov tells Stavrogin] because you're a nobleman's son, the last nobleman's son. You've lost the distinction between good and evil because you've ceased to know vour people. A new generation is coming, straight from the heart of the people, and you will know nothing of it, neither you nor the Verkhovenskys, father or son, nor I,</page><page sequence="18">JOSEPH FRANK 677 because I am also a nobleman's son, I, the son of your serf lackey Pashka. . . .' On the symbolic level of the book, this can only mean that all the ideologies deriving from Stavrogin (and here one feels very acutely that Stepan Trofimovich should be among them! ) are equally tainted by the original sin of their birth among a Western educated "aristocracy" totally divorced from the people ; all are doomed to be swept away by an authentically Russian culture of the future springing from the people's faith. V Stavrogin's personal behavior in these scenes also makes clear that he will never be able to achieve the total abandonment of self necessary for a religious conversion. Even with Shatov, whom he comes to warn about the impending danger, and to whom he is closer than anyone else except Darya Shatov, he can not confess the truth about Matryosha. He denies that he has "outraged children", just as he had lied earlier about his marriage to Marya Lebyadkin; and he refuses to answer when Shatov poses the question that was to be clarified in his visit to Tikhon: "Is it true that you saw no distinction between some brutal obscene action and any great exploit, even the sacrifice of life for the good of humanity? Is it true that you have found identical beauty, equal enjoyment, in both extremes?" Shatov displays the same insight into Stavrogin that Tikhon was later to exhibit when he diagnoses the motives of his marriage to Marya. "You married," Shatov says, "through a passion for martyrdom, from a craving for remorse, through moral sensuality." The first two impulses in Stavrogin, genuinely moral, are always crippled and distorted by the third, which stems from his enjoyment of the outrageously perverse, shocking, and sheerly gratuitous manifestations of his absolute self-will.</page><page sequence="19">678 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN Stavrogin's next visit to the Lebyadkins, framed by his two encounters with Fedka the convict, completes this sequence by unmasking Stavrogin as the "impostor" that he has been im plicitly shown to be all along. Lebyadkin himself, who antici pates Dimitri Karamazov, is a sleazy, down-at-heels comic parody of the extreme stretch of human possibilities?the taste for poetry and beauty on the one hand, the bestiality on the other? that we see in Stavrogin on the level of tragedy. His sister Marya, Stavrogin's virginal wife, is one of Dostoevsky's most poetic and enigmatic creations, whose exact purport has excited a good deal of discussion. Childish and mentally feeble, unable to distinguish between objective reality and dreams and desires, she yet pierces through the "mask" of Stavrogin with a clairvoy ance similar to that of Prince Myshkin or Father Zossima. And her sense of the sacredness of the cosmos, her affirmation that "the Mother of God is the great mother, the damp earth," who brings great joy to men when they "water the earth with [their] tears a foot deep", smacks of the esoteric, heretical lore of certain mystical sects of the raskolniki. It is not necessary to decide here between the various allegori cal and theological interpretations that have been offered of Marya; but she can scarcely be, as some critics have maintained, the positive heroine of the book. Certainly, in some sense, she represents Dostoevsky's vision of the primitive religious sensi bility of the Russian people, particularly in her feeling for the theurgic union between the Russian soil and "the Mother of God". But the debasement and pathos of her condition recall Dostoevsky's statement, in an article, that while the raskolniki demonstrated the unconquerable desire of the Russian people not to submit to alien ways of life, they themselves sometimes went to "hideous" and "misshapen" extremes as a reaction. In this context, Marya's poignant longing for a "Prince" who would not be ashamed to acknowledge her as his own takes on a good deal of historical-symbolic force; and her false and unnatural manage</page><page sequence="20">JOSEPH FRANK 679 blanc with Stavrogin, which has never been consummated, surely indicates that no true union is possible between the Christian Russian people and even the very finest flower of godless Russian Europeanism. Symbolically, again, it is entirely appropriate that Marya should finally unmask Stavrogin and label him unequivocally as the "impostor". Whatever confusions might have existed in the past, her demented second sight has now pierced through to his ultimate incapacity for true selflessness. "As soon as I saw your mean face when I fell and you picked me up?it was as if a worm had crawled into my heart," she says; "it's not he, I thought to myself, not he! My falcon would never have been ashamed of me in front of a young society lady! " Stavrogin starts with rage and terror when she prophetically alludes to his "knife", i.e., his lurking desire to have her murdered (on which Peter Verkhoven sky hopes to capitalize). And at the same time that she reads his inmost soul, she also speaks for the Russian people in assigning him his true historical-symbolic dimension. He is not the "Prince", not the genuine Lord and Ruler of Russia, but only Grishka Otrepeyev, "cursed in seven cathedrals", the impious and sacrilegious "impostor" and "false pretender" to the throne of God's Anointed Tsar. How justly Marya has seen into Stavrogin becomes even clearer when he tosses his wallet to Fedka the convict in the solitary darkness of the storm-tossed night. By this gesture, Stavrogin silently connives at the murder of the Lebyadkins and gives way once again to the temptation of evil ; and his inner de feat is dramatized again in his duel with Gaganov. Here Stav rogin is striving to achieve self-mastery and to avoid useless bloodshed; but his manner is so arrogant and contemptuous that he only arouses the uncontrollable hatred of his opponent all the more. The truly good Kirillov, ready to give his life for man kind, tries to explain to Stavrogin that moral self-conquest means a total suppression of egoism and the patient acceptance of any</page><page sequence="21">680 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN humiliation, even the most unjust and unwarranted. "Bear your burden," he says. "Or else there's no merit." But Stavrogin cannot bear the burden of good because, whatever his desire to do so, he can never negate his egoism entirely to the point of a total abandonment of reflexive self-concern. This crucial sequence of scenes is climaxed by Stavrogin's un expected meeting with Darya Shatov, which in the published text is about a page and a half shorter than in the original maga zine version. The section that Dostoevsky cut contained Stav rogin's admission that he was haunted by hallucinations and "devils" which he knew were only part of himself. But his be havior makes it clear that he is gradually beginning to believe in their reality, and this menace of madness was eventually to have driven him to visit Tikhon. When it proved impossible to include the confession-chapter Dostoevsky eliminated this prepa ration from the text, but one passage of the variant is important in clarifying the historical-symbolic structure that Dostoevsky had been planning. Stavrogin tells Darya that he has begun to be obsessed with a new "devil", which has taken on a different shape from any in the past. "Yesterday he was stupid and inso lent. He's a thick-headed seminarian with the soul of a lackey, self-satisfied, fully persuaded of his irresistible beauty; and what's more, with the conceit of the generation of the 1860's. . . . Nothing more repulsive! I was furious that my own devil could put on such a debasing mask." Stavrogin's obsessions, as we see, no longer take the form of the Romanticism, tinctured with reli gious feeling, of the 1840's; now they have degenerated into the arrogant and boorish Nihilism of the 1860's, whose leading pro ponents had all been "seminarians" (graduates of Russian theo logical seminaries). The ultimate consequences of this ideology are, of course, incarnated in the destructive and ruthless political activities of Peter Verkhovensky.</page><page sequence="22">JOSEPH FRANK 681 VI This scene, accordingly, was to have served as a transition be tween the first and second sections of Part II of the novel, and to have announced the thematic emergence of Peter Verkhovensky. For, immediately following this meeting, Dostoevsky shifts his focus from Stavrogin and moves out to the spread of the moral and social chaos sown by Peter Verkhovensky. In these chapters, Dostoevsky gives full play to his immense satiric verve in pillo rying all the people whose stupidity and lack of principle turn them into willing victims of Peter Verkhovensky's machinations. The ambitious bluestocking Julia von Lembke, determined to im press the most exalted spheres by the magic of her influence on the rebellious younger generation; her well-meaning Russo-German automaton of a husband, the Governor of the province, whose passion for making complicated toys defines the extent of his initiative and capacities; even the normally hard-headed Mrs. Stavrogin?all fall under Peter Verkhovensky's spell, which is powerfully aided and abetted by the patronage of the Great Writer Karmazinov (Turgenev). Mrs. von Lembke picks up the jargon of the Nihilists from Peter, and terribly impresses Mrs. Stavrogin with her mastery of the latest mode. "You care fully concealed all these new ideas from me," his irate patroness tells Stepan Trofimovich, "though everyone's familiar with them nowadays. And you did it simply out of jealousy, so as to have power over me. So that even now Julia is a hundred miles ahead of me." Only poor Stepan Trofimovich, more and more lonely, isolated and agitated, resists the general disintegration and still plans to vindicate his ideals. Starting as the personal foible of a few foolish people, the corruption becomes a demoralization in the most literal sense. Dostoevsky introduces a whole series of incidents to illustrate this demoralization, ranging from a breakdown of standards of per sonal conduct and social propriety to a disrespect for the dead</page><page sequence="23">682 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN and the desecration of a sacred ikon. Politically, Peter Verkho vensky demoralizes von Lembke by encouraging him to take the harshest and most despotic measures; and Peter dupes, deceives, and manipulates his followers no less than he has done with the von Lembkes. Precisely as with his general influence on society as a whole, the result of his effect on the radicals is a collapse of their own moral-political standards and the approval of wanton murder. There is a clear structural parallel between Stavrogin's round of visits in the first half of this section and Peter's calls, in the second half, on all the pawns he is engaged in maneuvering. Dostoevsky intended to bring these parallel sequences together by the two chapters of self-revelation that would have concluded Part II?Verkhovensky's mad hymn to universal destruction in spired by Stavrogin, and then the disclosure of the moral bank ruptcy and despair of Verkhovensky's "idol" as he makes his con fession to Tikhon. From his first appearance in the novel, Peter Verkhovensky is depicted as the very genius of duplicity; even the details of his physical appearance are deceptive. Under the surface of simple minded frankness and disarming caddishness, Verkhovensky car ries on his work of sowing demoralization and destruction; he is Stavrogin's demonism working as a political will-to-power. "I invented you abroad," he cries furiously to Stavrogin; "I in vented it all, looking at you. If I hadn't watched you from my corner, nothing of all this would have entered my head." What Peter has invented, under the spell of Stavrogin, is the plan to consecrate him as Ivan the Tsarevich?to use the very force he wishes to destroy, the faith of the Russian people in a just and righteous God-anointed ruler, as the means of their own destruc tion. This plan has obvious symbolic affinities with Stavrogin's relation to Kirillov and Shatov, and is foreshadowed in Marya's charge that Stavrogin is "Grishka Otrepeyev"; here too it has in spired a "mask" of the Truth shorn of its foundations in religion. This "mask" is "beautiful", as Peter exclaims ecstatically while</page><page sequence="24">JOSEPH FRANK 683 gazing at Stavrogin, but it is the beauty of the demonic; and when Peter passionately tells Stavrogin, "You are my idol!" this last word should be taken in its full, blasphemous sense. Peter's plan, however, implicitly contains its own self-negation, since it reveals the impotence of his godless and amoral principles to es tablish any basis for human life. Falsehood and idolatry must speak deceptively in the name of Truth and God; and this is a confession of its bankruptcy. Later, in The Brothers Karamazov, the same dialectic will be used when the Grand Inquisitor speaks in the name of Christ. Doestoevsky had planned to place Stavrogin's confession to the true God (in the person of His servitor Tikhon) following Verk hovensky's "confession" to the false God Stavrogin. This would have dramatized all the horror and abomination of the "idol" that Peter Verkhovensky was worshiping. After a sleepless night spent in warding off his hallucinations, Stavrogin was to have gone to Tikhon; and here the secret of his past, which has been repeatedly hinted at, was finally to have been revealed. Like Onegin and Pechorin, Stavrogin is a victim of the famous mal du si?cle, the all-engulfing ennui that haunts the literature of the first half of the nineteenth century and whose cause is invariably the disappearance of religious faith. Baudelaire, its greatest poet, called ennm the deadliest of the vices: Quoiquyil ne fous se ni grands gestes ni grands cris, Il ferait volontiers de la terre un d?bris Et dans un b?illement avalerait le monde. ... Ennui is one of the symptoms of that "romantic agony" whose dossier has been so industriously compiled by Mario Praz, and, as he has shown, its usual result is one or another form of moral perversion. Dostoevsky has depicted it as such previously in Prince Valkovsky {The Insulted and Injured}, Svidrigailov {Crime and Punishment), and in the sudden appearance of Cleo 9</page><page sequence="25">684 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN patra in Notes from Underground sticking golden pins into her slave-girls for amusement. With Stavrogin, it has led to the abominable violation of little Matryosha and his unspeakably vile observation of her death-throes. All this is the result of Stavrogin's attempt to pass beyond the limits of good and evil, to put into practice, with the maniacal determination of Dostoevsky's negative heroes, the conviction that good and evil simply do not exist. "I have neither the feel ing nor the knowledge of good and evil," Stavrogin tells himself just after the little girl's death, formulating the rationale by which he has tried to live, "and not only have I lost the sense of good and evil, but good and evil really do not exist (and this pleased me) and are but a prejudice; I can be free of all prej udices, but at the very moment when I achieve that freedom I shall perish." These were, as Stavrogin says, "old familiar thoughts" that he was at last putting clearly to himself for the first time; these were the convictions that had been responsible for all his behavior in the past. Like Raskolnikov's crime, Stav rogin's revolting and despicable escapades had been a great moral philosophical experiment; and this is why Dostoevsky had taken such pains from the very start to dissociate his conduct from any kind of banal and self-indulgent debauchery. Stavrogin's desire to transcend the human, to pass entirely beyond the bounds of good and evil, nonetheless runs aground on the hidden reef of conscience. No matter what Stavrogin may think he believes, he cannot entirely suppress his feeling for the difference between good and evil; and this irrepressible instinct erupts from his subconscious?almost always the guardian of morality for Dostoevsky?in his famous dream of "The Golden Age" inspired by Claude Lorrain's painting Acts and Galatea. The vision of a primeval Earthly Paradise of happiness and in nocence fills his heart with overflowing joy. "I woke and opened my eyes, for the first time in my life literally wet with tears. . . . A feeling of happiness, hitherto unknown to me, pierced my heart</page><page sequence="26">JOSEPH FRANK 685 till it ached." But then a tiny red spider, associated in Stavrogin's subconscious with Matryosha's death, replaces this dream-reverie of bliss, and he sees in his mind's eye the little girl standing on the threshold of his room and threatening him with her little fist. "Pity for her stabbed me," he writes, "a maddening pity, and I would have given my body to be torn to pieces if that would have erased what had happened." Stavrogin finds this vision of his own evil unbearable, but he continues to evoke it voluntarily and unendingly all the same; it is this unsupportable need to expiate his crime?a need that nothing he knows of or believes in can help him to absolve?that is gradually driving him mad. Stavrogin's confession thus makes clear the source of his inner torments; but these torments have never been strong enough totally to triumph over his supreme egoism and self-will. Even his confession, as Tikhon rightly senses, is only another and ex treme form of the "moral sensuality" that has marked all his previous attempts at self-mastery. "This document," Tikhon says of his confession, "is born of a heart wounded unto death. . . . But it is as though you were already hating and despising in ad vance all those who will read what you have written, and chal lenging them to an encounter." Tikhon knows that Stavrogin by himself can never achieve the true humility of genuine repent ance; his need for suffering and martyrdom can thus only lead to more and more terrible and disastrous provocations. This is why he urges Stavrogin to submit his will comfletely to the secret control of a saintly staretz, and thus discipline himself by a total surrender to another as the first step along the path to the accept ance of Christ and the hope of forgiveness. But Stavrogin, irritably breaking an ivory crucifix that he has been fingering dur ing the conversation, rejects this final admonition and goes to his self-destruction.</page><page sequence="27">686 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN VII The impossibility of including this confession-chapter?clearly marked on one proof-sheet as Chapter 9 of Part II?in its proper place evidently forced Dostoevsky to mutilate the original sym metry of his plan. In Part II, which would probably have termi nated with Chapter 9, he exposes the origins of the disorder and chaos sown by Stavrogin and his "worshiper" Peter Verkhoven sky; then, in Part III, he would have depicted as a unified move ment the practical results of their handiwork. Instead, he tacked on the present Chapter 9 ("Stepan Verkhovensky is Raided") in place of the confession-scene; but from this point on there is, all the same, a continuous sequence developing the catastrophic social consequences of Peter Verkhovensky's machinations. The first symptom is the ridiculous raid on Stepan Trofimovich, prompted by the political leaflets and his general decline in prestige; the second is von Lembke's madness, brought on by jealousy and resentment of Peter and by the irresponsible giddiness of his hare brained spouse. As a result of von Lembke's hysteria, the per fectly peaceful demonstration of the Shpigulin workers, who had been shamefully cheated and wished to redress their grievances, is broken up by brutal floggings. "I may mention, as character istic of our society," bitingly remarks the narrator, "that there were very few of the better-class people who saw reason to sup pose that there was anything wrong with him [von Lembke] ; his conduct seemed to them perfectly normal, and so much so that the action he had taken in the square the morning before was accepted and approved." Chaos reaches a climax, of course, in the weird and wonderful "f?te" for the underprivileged governesses of the province, which is certainly one of the greatest comic extravaganzas in the whole history of the novel. For sheer verve it equals the exuberance of similar scenes of mass mayhem in Smollett; but Dostoevsky's satirical thrusts go much deeper than Smollett's ridicule</page><page sequence="28">JOSEPH FRANK 687 of some fashionable social stupidities. All the demoraliza tion that has been brewing in the depths suddenly spouts forth like volcanic lava, beginning with Lebyadkin's drunken, off-color poem and ending with the glow of burning houses across the river in the night sky. And Stepan Trofimovich, finally screwing up the courage to denounce the Nihilists publicly, restates the symbolic meaning of the book in his own personal aesthetic terms. "The enthusiasm of our modern youth," he declaims, "is as pure and shining as it was in our time. Only one thing has happened: a shift of aims, a substitution of one beauty for another. The whole misunderstanding lies only in this question: what is more beautiful, Shakespeare or boots, Raphael or petroleum?" Begin ning with Stepan Trofimovich's prose-poem glorifying the "beauty" of Death, and continuing with the various false ide ologies inspired by the deceitful "beauty" of Stavrogin, the loss of the true beauty of the Divine has led to the grotesque vulgariza tion against which Stepan Trofimovich protests?the replacement of the great creators of mankind's eternal ideals by the crudest and coarsest materialism. The "f?te" is the moment when all the "masks" are thrown off and the truth finally comes to light; it is thus appropriate that Stepan Trofimovich's vehement denunci ation should also be a disclosure of Dostoevsky's underlying symbolic pattern. The other incidents of the "f?te", almost all culled from one or another historical source, add nothing to the denouement and need not be discussed here. Stavrogin hardly appears in this last third of the book; but Dostoevsky terminates his romance with Liza by a scene where his incapacity to love (not sexually, but ethically and humanly) is sharply stressed. Most of the con cluding action is taken up with the murder of Shatov after the arrival of his wife bearing Stavrogin's illegitimate child. The scene between Shatov and his wife is in a mood of tenderness un usual for Dostoevsky, and the brief portrait of the disillusioned, betrayed, heartsick "new woman" is Dostoevsky's sole (but un</page><page sequence="29">688 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN forgettable) treatment of the "woman question" theme of the 1860's. Maria's self-contempt for her own femininity?her struggle between a natural joy and tenderness on the one hand, and an unwillingness to accept the humiliation of dependence on the other?is beautifully rendered. The murder of Shatov, just at the moment when he catches a glimpse of happiness at last, is an excellent example of Dostoevsky's skill in manipulating his plot to achieve the strongest effects of contrast. The murder of Shatov, and the suicide of Kirillov, both ex hibit the same reversion and retrogression to the inhuman. The hapless conspirators are far from sharing Peter's insouciance about human life; and the murder terrifies both Lyamshin and Virgin sky into a panic relapse into animality. "Lyamshin gave vent to a scream more animal than human, [and] he went on shrieking without a pause, his mouth wide open and his eyes starting out of his head. . . . Virginsky was so scared that he too screamed out like a madman, and with a ferocity, a vindictiveness that one could not have expected of Virginsky." Kirillov's death is not the triumphant assertion of a total self-will, but the demented act of a crazed and terrorized sub-human creature; the annihilation of God does not lead to mastery over the pain and fear of death, but to the animal frenzy with which Kirillov sinks his teeth into Peter Verkhovensky's hand. Like Raskolnikov's deed of murder, Kirillov's suicide is the self-negation and self-refutation of his grandiose theories. Neither Shatov nor Kirillov is developed in any new manner in these final scenes. The comic odyssey of Stepan Trofimovich, however, plunges him into entirely new and unexpected circum stances. Nothing is finer in the book than the bewildered contact between the sheltered, pampered Liberal Idealist, who has spent his life uttering fine phrases about "the people", and the dumb founded Russian peasants whom he finally encounters. These scenes are an astonishing anticipation of what actually happened a few years after The Devils was published, when, with the self</page><page sequence="30">JOSEPH FRANK 689 sacrificing zeal of the early Christians, the flower of Russian youth decided to abandon everything, like Stepan Trofimovich, and "go to the people". Exactly the same bewilderment and confusion that Dostoevsky describes so amusingly was felt on both sides; and there was, in addition, a by no means comic suspicion and mistrust of the "educated" intelligents that often led to their being denounced to the police. Poor Stepan Trofimovich, though he does get swindled, was mercifully spared this final blow.4 Dostoevsky's picture of the dying Stepan Trofimovich is one of the finest demonstrations of his artistic tact and scrupulosity. Having been deprived both of his positive Christian figure in Tikhon, and of the opportunity to confront Stavrogin's despair with the divine mystery of Christ's all-forgiving love, Dostoevsky must certainly have been tempted to nudge Stepan Trofimovich's repentance in some dogmatic Christian direction; but he carefully avoids violating the integrity of his superb creation. From the first pages Stepan Trofimovich has been presented, not as an atheist, to be sure, but as a species of Hegelian Deist. "I believe in God," he says, "mais distinguons, I believe in Him as a Being who is conscious of Himself in me only." Nothing that Stepan Trofimovich says in these last pages contradicts his aversion to the vulgar anthropomorphism of the popular faith; and the chronicler maintains a healthy skepticism over "whether he was really converted, or whether the stately ceremony of the adminis tration of the sacraments had impressed and stirred the artistic responsiveness of his temperament". Nor does he lose his taste for risque religious puns even on his deathbed; it is after an irascible outburst of Varvara Petrovna that he smiles faintly, and 4?Tn the Summer of 1874 the radical youth, inspired by the signs of ^ success that they had themselves projected on reality, abandoned their academic pursuits to plunge, inexperienced and untutored, into the countryside. Their hopes of an enthusiastic welcome evaporated on first contact with the peasantry. The image of the peasant as incipient revolutionary corresponded little with the sullen country folk they met, who, seem'ngly resolute in their trust of autocracy, met them with distrust and hostility. Hopelessly vulnerable to arrest once they strayed outside the capital, they were herded into, prison bv the hundreds." Richard Wortman, The Crisis of Russian Populism, Cambridge U. P., 1967, p. 18.</page><page sequence="31">690 THE MASKS OF STAVROGIN says: "God is necessary to me if only because He is the only being whom one can love eternally." Stepan Trofimovich, then, does not die a Christian in any strict meaning of the word, but he is stirred by a reading of the Sermon on the Mount to acknowledge: "My friend, all my life I've been lying" ; and after hearing the passage from St. Luke about the "devils" who had entered into the herd of swine, he says: "They are we, we and those . . . and Petrusha and les autres avec lui. . . and I perhaps at the head of them. . . ." This speech hardly accords with the subordinate r?le that Stepan Trofimovich has played throughout the action -, it is Stavrogin who has been shown, in fact, to have been "at the head" of all the "devils" (the "perhaps" in the last phrase, which accurately translates the Russian text, may indicate Dostoevsky's awareness of the problem). This weakness of structure, however, springs directly from Dostoevsky's original misstep in making Stavrogin the pupil of Stepan Trofimovich. More convincing, and entirely in character, is Stepan Trofimovich's final statement of his credo : "The whole law of human existence is merely this, that man should always bow down before the infinitely great. If people are deprived of the infinitely great, they will not continue to live and will die in despair. The infinite and immeasurable are as necessary to man as the little planet on which he dwells. My friends, all, all: Long live the Great Idea!" This is not Christian in any theo logical sense, but it contains enough of a feeling for the tran scendent to constitute an answer to the hubris of the purely human embodied in Stavrogin. Stavrogin's suicide, which terminates the action, had been fore seen by Dostoevsky from his very first grasp of the character; but if he had been able to include the confession-chapter, it is likely that Stavrogin would have been given a greater place in the last third of the text. Some of Dostoevski's notes show Stavrogin in strumental in solving the murder of Shatov, assembling the town for a special service of repentance, making a speech denouncing</page><page sequence="32">JOSEPH FRANK 691 the horrors of atheistic destruction, and only then unexpectedly committing suicide. There is no way of knowing, of course, whether Dostoevsky would have used these ideas in his final re daction; but they would have been far more consistent with Strav rogin's importance in the first two-thirds of the book. In the pres ent version, the reader knows neither that Stavrogin has made a superhuman endeavor to transcend the boundaries of good and evil, nor that his conscience has driven him to the point of mad ness; thus his act loses much of its symbolic meaning as a self condemnation of all the ideologies that he had spawned. The Devils, it must be admitted, ends somewhat anticlimacti cally, for reasons very largely outside of Dostoevsky's power to remedy by the time he had reached the final pages. But the scope of his canvas, the brilliant ferocity of his wit, the prophetic power and percipience of his satire, his sheer imaginative capacity to bring to life the most profound and complex ideological issues ?all combine to make this "pamphlet-poem" perhaps his most original creation. It is an unprecedented historical-symbolic epic of nineteenth-century Russian culture, unlike anything in its own time except, possibly, Flaubert's comparatively tame and dispirited U?ducation sentimentale, and it is also, without doubt, the greatest novel ever inspired by the theme of political con spiracy and revolution.</page></plain_text>
