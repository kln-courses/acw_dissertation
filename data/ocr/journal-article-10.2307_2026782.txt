<plain_text><page sequence="1">VAN FRAASSEN ON EXPLANATION 315 VAN FRAASSEN ON EXPLANATION* HERE should be no doubt about the fact that Bas van Fraas- sen has made substantial contributions to our current un- derstanding of scientific explanation. But we believe that there is reason for doubt as to exactly what the contributions are. Chapter V of The Scientific Image, "The Pragmatics of Explana- tion," offers the most detailed account of van Fraassen's view of explanation. We find both the title and the view ambiguous. The purpose of the present discussion is to underscore the difference between a theory of the pragmatics of explanation and a pragmatic theory of explanation. We believe that van Fraassen has offered the best theory of the pragmatics of explanation to date, but we shall argue that, if his proposal is seen as a pragmatic theory of explana- tion, then it faces serious difficulties. I Before we turn to van Fraassen's positive views, we want to consider his response to the tradition of theorizing about explanation. Ac- cording to van Fraassen, there are two main problems "of the philo- sophical theory of explanation." These are "to account for legitimate rejections of explanation requests, and for the asymmetries of expla- nation" (146). Van Fraassen's solution to the former problem seems to us to be ingenious and substantially correct (see below). His treat- ment of the asymmetries of explanation we find deeply puzzling. Within the mainstream of philosophical reflection about explana- tion, the problem of asymmetries arises because there are arguments which are closely related, which accord equally well with the condi- tions set down by models of explanation, and which differ dramati- cally in their explanatory worth. For present purposes assume either that some explanations (including the examples to be considered) are arguments or that some arguments (including those to be consid- ered) provide a basis for acts of explanation.' Then the challenge is * The present paper grew out of discussions between us at the Minnesota Center for the Philosophy of Science during the fall of 1985. We would like to acknowledge the support of the National Endowment for the Humanities for a grant that made our collaboration possible. We are also grateful to Bas van Fraassen for some helpful clarifications of his ideas, made in response to an earlier draft. Parenthetical page references are to The Scientific Image (New York: Oxford, 1980). ' The idea that arguments might provide the basis for acts of explanation is suggested in Philip Kitcher, "Explanatory Unification," Philosophy of Science, XLVIII, 4 (December 1981): 507-531; and is articulated in some detail by Peter Railton, "Probability, Explanation, and Information," Synthese, XLVIII, 2 (August 1981): 233-256.

The former seems to be (a potential basis for) an explanation, whereas the latter does not. One line of solution, hinted at by Carl Hempel in discussion of an analogous case,' is to propose that there is no real difference be- tween the two arguments and that the feeling of difference arises from anthropomorphic ideas from which we ought to liberate our- selves. This is not very convincing, and van Fraassen appears to adopt a more satisfactory method of dissolving the problem. One way to understand his fable, "The Tower and the Shadow," is as an attempt to show that the claim of explanatory difference is shortsighted. Failing to appreciate that arguments are explanations (the basis of explanations) only relative to context, we assess the explanatory merits of the derivations by tacitly supposing contexts that occur in everyday life. With a little imagination, we can see that there are alternative contexts in which the argument we dismiss would count as explanatory. In van Fraassen's story, a character offers the following explana- tion of the height of a tower: That tower marks the spot where [the Chevalier] killed the maid with whom he had been in love to the point of madness. And the height of the tower? He vowed that shadow would cover the terrace where he first proclaimed his love, with every setting sun-that is why the tower had to be so high (133/4). Now we grant that van Fraassen's story describes a context in which the utterance of these words constitutes an explanation for the posi- tion and height of the tower. But this will solve the traditional problem of the asymmetries of explanation only if one can claim that the argument underlying the quoted passage is the argument that the unimaginative have dismissed as nonexplanatory. It seems obvious that this is not so. For the (D-N; deductive-no- mological) argument that provides the basis for the act of explana- tion van Fraassen relates does not take the form of deducing the arguments, or involve arguments in any essential way, this issue does not affect the present discussion of van Fraassen's views in any significant fashion. 2 "Aspects of Scientific Explanation," in Aspects of Scientific Explanation (New York: The Free Press, 1965).

Rather, we begin with some initial conditions about the psychological characteristics of the Chevalier-he wanted to build a tower with certain properties; he knew certain physical facts. Using general principles of rationality, we infer a statement to the effect that the Chevalier came to believe that, if he built a tower of the appropriate height on the appropriate spot, it would meet his desiderata. Using yet another principle of rationality, we infer that the Chevalier built the tower to these specifications, and, using background principles about the stability of the height and position of such large physical objects, we conclude that the tower has the height and position it has. It appears that an obvious way to interpret van Fraassen is mis- taken: his story does not provide a context in which an argument wrongly dismissed as explanatory shows its explanatory worth. More- over, since van Fraassen points out, quite explicitly, the dependency on desires (132), we take him to appreciate that his story does not solve the traditional problem of the asymmetries of explanation. Instead, we construe him as claiming that the problem as we have posed it-a problem that talks about arguments and their merits as explanations (the bases of explanations)-is misposed. Once the topic is approached in terms of van Fraassen's favored pragmatic machinery, we are to see that an answer that we might have consid- ered inappropriate can have explanatory worth in the right context. But this leaves us with puzzles. If we cannot formulate the tradi- tional problem of the asymmetries of explanation in terms of argu- ments, then how is the problem to be formulated? Does an analogous problem arise within van Fraassen's own theory? Is it resolved by that theory? We shall return to these questions below. II According to van Fraassen, an explanation is an answer to a question Q of the form: Why Pk? where Pk states the fact to be explained-i.e., the explanandum (phenomenon). Any such question can be identi- fied as an ordered triple &lt;Pk, X, R&gt;, where Pk is called "the topic" of the question, X = {PI, . . , Pk, . . } is its contrast class, and R is its relevance relation. Such a question is posed in a context that includes a body of background knowledge K. Q also has a presupposition, namely (a) Pk is true; (b) each P1 in X is false if j =# k; (c) there is at least one true proposition A that bears relation R to KPk, X&gt;.</page><page sequence="4">318 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY (a) and (b) together constitute the central presupposition of Q. The why-question Q arises in the given context if K entails the central presupposition of Q and does not entail the falsity of (c). That is, it is altogether appropriate to raise Q even if we do not know whether there is a direct answer or not, provided the central presupposition is fulfilled. If the question does not arise in the context, it should be rejected rather than answered directly. This can be done by offering a correc- tive answer, i.e., a denial of one or more parts of the presupposition. If the central presupposition is satisfied but (c) is in doubt, a correc- tive answer to the effect that (c) is false may be suitable. If the question arises in the given context, it is normally appro- priate to provide a direct answer. The canonical form of a direct answer to Q is (*) Pk in contrast to the rest of X because A. The following conditions must be met: (i) A is true. (ii) Pk is true. (iii) No member of X other than Pk is true. (iv) A bears R to KPk, X&gt;. A is the core of the answer, for the answer can be abbreviated "Be- cause A." Since, typically, the person Sq who asks the question Q might be someone with a different body of knowledge from the respondent Sr, we might be tempted to say that two different contexts are involved. It seems more in keeping with van Fraassen's approach, however, to understand that Sq and Sr are operating in a common context with a common body of background knowledge K determined roughly by the state of science at the time. Thus, K may contain many proposi- tions that neither the questioner nor the respondent knows. More- over, Sq may have false beliefs that are in conflict with propositions in K. Sr may therefore offer corrective answers to flawed questions by pointing to items in K. Whether A, the core of the answer to Q, is relevant depends solely on the relevance relation R. If A bears R to KPk, X&gt; then A is, by definition, the core of a relevant answer to Q. This way of stating the matter raises a difficulty. In his informal remarks, van Fraassen re- peatedly refers to R as a "relevance relation," but he incorporates no relevance requirement on R in the formal characterization. Indeed, he points to the absence of any problematic constraint that would</page><page sequence="5">VAN FRAASSEN ON EXPLANATION 319 seek to capture "the inextricably modal or counterfactual element" (143). Now, if R happens to be a relevance relation, then it is indeed correct to say that A is relevant to KPk, X&gt;. But, as we shall now show, the lack of any constraints on "relevance" relations allows just about anything to count as the answer to just about any question. III Let Pk be any true proposition. Let X be any set of propositions such that Pk belongs to X and every member of X apart from Pk is false. Let A be any true proposition. Let R be {KA, KPk, X&gt;&gt;} U S, where S is any set of ordered pairs KY, Z&gt; such that Yis a proposition and Z is K V, W&gt; where V is a proposition and W a set of propositions, one of whose members is V. Then there is a why-question Q = KPk, X, R&gt;, and A is the core of a direct answer to Q. Moreover, it is easy to see that, with suitable restrictions on S (i.e., that S contain no &lt;Y, Z&gt; such that Y is true and Z is KPk, X&gt;), A may be the core of the only direct answer to Q. Hence, for any true propositions Pk and A, there is a why-question with topic Pk such that A is the core of the only direct answer to that question. If explanations are answers to why-ques- tions, then it follows that, for any pair of true propositions, there is a context in which the first is the (core of the) only explanation of the second. We take it that this result is counterintuitive. Indeed, we would view it as a reductio of van Fraassen's account of explanation. How can it be avoided? One way of blocking the trivialization we have outlined would be to impose restrictions on relevance relations. We shall consider this possibility below. First, let us note that van Fraassen's theory of explanation comes in two parts: there is a thesis about what answers to why-questions are, and there is a thesis about how to evaluate answers to why-questions. Perhaps we can use the latter part of the story to defend against the trivialization that threatens the former. According to van Fraassen, we evaluate answers to why-questions on three different grounds. We ask whether those answers are proba- ble in light of our knowledge, we ask whether they favor the topic against the other members of the contrast class, and we ask whether they are made wholly or partially irrelevant by other answers that could be given. Using a notion that van Fraassen often employs in his informal remarks but does not define, let us say that an answer is telling if it scores well according to these criteria. More exactly, let us propose that an answer is more or less telling according to its performance on the three criteria. We shall be most interested in maximally telling answers. We shall call them perfect answers.</page><page sequence="6">320 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Notice that the theory of evaluating answers to why-questions allows us to compare different answers to the same questions. It does not enable us to assess the degree to which an answer to one question is more telling than an answer to another question. If the questions are of the contrived kind that we introduced at the beginning of this section, then there will be no more telling answer to them than the contrived answer. However, we may easily introduce a grading of questions by considering whether they admit of answers that favor their topic. Let us say that questions are more or less well-founded to the extent that they admit of telling answers. Thus, a question will be maximally well-founded if it admits of a perfect answer. Suppose now that Pk is any true proposition, A any proposition, and X any set of two or more propositions such that Pk is its only true member. Let K be a set of propositions that includes both Pk and A, as well as the negations of all the other propositions in X. Then, we claim, there is a why-question whose topic is Pk, whose contrast class is X, such that A is an essential part of a perfect answer to that why-question. To demonstrate this we need to examine in somewhat more detail van Fraassen's criteria for evaluating answers. On the first criterion, we award high marks to answers if they receive high probability in light of our background knowledge. A corollary of this is that, if the answer belongs to our background knowledge-as is often the case when we give scientific explanations-then it does as well as possible according to this criterion. The second criterion (favoring) is less straightforward. Van Fraas- sen's idea is that the answer, to score well, should increase the dis- tance between the probability of the topic and the probabilities of the other members of the contrast class. Typically, the answer alone will not redistribute probabilities in this way. Rather, the answer, taken together with certain auxiliary information, will redistribute the probabilities. However, we cannot suggest that the answer plus the total background knowledge K achieves this result; for, in cases where the topic and the negations of the other members of the contrast class belong to K, the suggestion would lead to immediate trivialization. Van Fraassen therefore suggests that the redistribution of probabilities be achieved by the answer in conjunction with "a certain part K(Q) of K," where K(Q) is supposed to be contextually determined. We need not delve into the problems of deciding exactly what counts as singling out the topic within the contrast class, since we shall use a case in which van Fraassen explicitly recognizes that an</page><page sequence="7">VAN FRAASSEN ON EXPLANATION 321 answer is maximally successful. He writes: "If K(Q) plus A implies B and implies the falsity of C,. . . , N then A receives in this context the highest marks for favoring the topic B" (147). [There is a switch in notation here; the topic is B, the contrast class is {B, C, . . . , N}]. Van Fraassen's third criterion concerns the availability of superior answers. The answer A loses marks if it has a rival that fares better, perhaps because the rival receives higher probability in light of background knowledge K, perhaps because the rival favors the topic more than A does, perhaps because the rival screens off A from the topic. Now A does not have to fear any rival if A belongs to K and if A plus K(Q) implies the topic and the negations of the other members of the contrast class. For, under these circumstances, no rival can be more probable in light of K, no rival can do better at favoring the topic, and no rival can screen A off from the topic. We conclude that any A belonging to K which, in conjunction with K(Q), implies the topic Pk is a perfect answer to the question &lt;Pk, X, R&gt; (provided, of course, that it is an answer to this question). Let us therefore define a "relevance relation" R as follows: we stipulate that R holds between B and &lt;Pk, X&gt; just in case Pk is a logical consequence of B. Let Z be the disjunction of all the proposi- tions in X apart from Pk, and let B be the proposition A *(AD Pk) * Z This proposition bears R to &lt;Pk, X&gt;, and hence it counts as the core of a direct answer to the why-question &lt;Pk, X, R&gt;. Moreover, by our earlier assumption, A, Pk, and -Z belong to K. This means that all the conjuncts in B, and hence B itself, belong to K. Thus, B will be completely successful according to van Fraassen's first criterion for evaluating answers. Because Pk* --Z is a logical consequence of B, B maximally favors Pk-and we do not need to worry about how K(Q) is selected since Pk* --Z is a consequence of B alone. Finally, because of this implication, there is no reason to fear that B will be screened off by some rival answer. Therefore, B is a perfect answer to Pk , X, R&gt; We have devised one way of finding, for any pair of true proposi- tions A, Pk, a why-question with Pk as topic to which there is a perfect answer with A as an essential part of its core. Moreover, once we see how the construction we have given is possible, it is easy to generate variations on the same theme. For example, if van Fraassen's account does not contain context-independent principles that preclude the possibility of assigning (A D Pk)* --Z to K(Q), then it will be possible</page><page sequence="8">322 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY to claim that A is the core of a direct perfect answer to some question with Pk as topic. We conclude that the machinery that van Fraassen introduces in his discussion of the evaluation of answers does not avail in protect- ing him against the kind of trivialization we presented at the begin- ning of this section. The moral is that, unless he imposes some con- ditions on relevance relations, his theory is committed to the result that almost anything can explain almost anything. Some kinds of relations R are silly, and why-questions that embody them are silly questions. If we pose silly questions, we should not be surprised to get silly answers. IV Let us now consider a concrete example. Suppose Sq asks why John F. Kennedy died on November 22, 1963, where Pk = JFK died 11/22/63, X = {JFK died 1/1/63, JFK died 1/2/63,... JFK died 12/31/63, JFK survived 1963}, and R is a relation of astral influence. (One way to define R is to consider ordered pairs of descriptions of the positions of stars and planets at the time of a person's birth and propositions about that person's fate.) An answer with core A might consist of a true de- scription of the positions of the stars and planets at the time of JFK's birth. Moreover, using astrological theory as background, one might be able to infer (at least with high probability) that JFK would die on 11/22/63. We suggest that, in the context of twentieth-century science, the appropriate response to the question is rejection. According to our present lights, astral influence is not a relevance relation. We believe that the positions of the stars and planets on JFK's birthday have no effect on the probability of death on any particular day. Adding the knowledge of those positions does nothing to redistribute the proba- bilities of death among the members of the contrast class. The moral we draw here-as in the last section-is that van Fraassen's condi- tions (a)-(c) on answers to why-questions need to be supplemented by adding (d) R is a relevance relation. Moreover, we claim that (d) cannot be analyzed simply in terms of demanding that, if A bears R to KPk, X&gt;, then A must redistribute the probabilities on X. For we can meet that demand by considering the proposition</page><page sequence="9">VAN FRAASSEN ON EXPLANATION 323 B = A-(If A, then JFK died on 11/22/63) .JFK did not die on 1/1/63 . . . JFK did not die on 11/21/63 .JFK did not die on 11/23/63; *. . . .JFK did not survive 1963) and defining the relation of astral influence R so that R contains KB, KPk, X&gt;&gt;. Once again, let us consider the question from the perspective of van Fraassen's account of evaluating answers. We note, first, that the true description of the positions of stars and planets at JFK's birth accords with our current scientific knowledge. So the answer gets high marks on this score. Second, we ask to what extent A favors Pk vis-a-vis the other members of X. On this criterion A fares poorly (although B, of course, does not). Perhaps an answer that negatively favored the topic might get still lower marks-though it is not clear to us that it should, since discovering a relevant factor seems better than offering an irrelevancy. Third, we must compare A with other answers to Q. This criterion has three parts. (i) Since A is true and since it belongs to our body of knowledge, no other answer can be more probable. (ii) Since no astrological answer is relevant, all astro- logical answers equally fail to favor the topic. (iii) Since every astro- logical answer is irrelevant, screening off is beside the point. The result is that A is not telling. There is no telling answer to our original question. If we amend the question, we can produce a rela- tive to which B is a maximally telling answer. In our view, both the questions ought to be rejected, and van Fraassen needs to supple- ment his theory of explanation with an account of relevance rela- tions. The astrological answer has a further twist, however. As van Fraassen explains, our general background knowledge K-suitably restricted to K(Q) to avoid trivialization-furnishes a prior distribu- tion of probabilities over the contrast class X. (Note that, in discuss- ing favoring with respect to the contrived example of section III, and answer B of this section, we were entitled to take K(Q) to be any subset of K because we had no need of any additional premises in generating the most extreme distribution of probabilities over the contrast class.) Given A, we have a posterior distribution of probabil- ities over X. (It should not be assumed that the prior distribution assigns equal probabilities to all members of X; surely, survival beyond 1963 was antecedently more likely than death on any given day, and surely some days are more dangerous than others in the life of a U.S. President.) A is the core of a relevant answer to Q only if addition of A to K(Q) would yield a posterior distribution different from the prior distribution. But what sorts of probabilities are these?</page><page sequence="10">324 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY If they are Sq's personal probabilities, then, given that Sq is a believer in astrology, we might well expect that knowledge of A would lead to a different distribution. So A would be relevant after all. Van Fraassen might reply that astrological answers are debarred by his (frequently repeated)3 remarks that explanations make use of accepted scientific theories. The astrological answers are precluded by the fact that they contain statements that are inconsistent with the background knowledge K. But this seems to mistake the purport of our examples. The statement A belongs to the background corpus; it is simply a report of the positions of the heavenly bodies at the time of JFK's birth, and we can assume that this report derives from the best current science. Of course, if the answer includes further bits of astrological theory designed to connect A with the statement that JFK died on 11/22/63, then van Fraassen will have grounds for ruling it out. But, if the favoring of the topic is achieved solely through Sq's personal probabilities, then there is nothing in the an- swer to which van Fraassen can point as defective. Similarly, there is nothing in B that would be debarred on the basis of an appeal to background knowledge, for all the statements in B belong to the background corpus. It should now be clear that these examples work by exploiting the laxity of the conditions on the relevance relation in order to reintro- duce "explanations" that van Fraassen hopes to debar by emphasiz- ing the idea that good explanation must use good science. Unless there are constraints on genuine relevance relations, we can mimic the appeal to deviant beliefs in giving pseudoexplanations by em- ploying deviant relevance relations. Hence, if van Fraassen is serious in his idea that genuine explanations must not make appeal to "old wives' tales," then he ought to be equally serious about showing that relevance is not completely determined by subjective factors. If we are talking about distributions and redistributions of personal proba- bilities, they must be subject to some kinds of standards or criteria. 'At the outset of his exposition of his theory of why-questions, van Fraassen remarks, "This evaluation [of answers] proceeds with reference to the part of science accepted as 'background theory' in that context" (141). Earlier, he had remarked that, "To ask that . . . explanations be scientific is only to ask that they rely on scientific theories and experimentation, not on old wives' tales" (129), and "To sum up: no factor is explanatorily relevant unless it is scientifically relevant; and among the scientifically relevant factors, context determines explanatorily relevant ones" (126). In conclusion, he says, "To call an explanation scientific is to say nothing about its form or the sort of information adduced, but only that the explanation draws on science to get this information (at least to some extent) and, more importantly, that the criteria of evaluation of how good an explanation it is, are being employed using a scientific theory" (155/6).</page><page sequence="11">VAN FRAASSEN ON EXPLANATION 325 Coherence is one such criterion, but it cannot be sufficient. To be scientifically acceptable, the redistribution of probabilities must in- volve differences in objective probabilities (frequencies or propensi- ties) in some fashion. v When van Fraassen explicitly discusses kinds of relevance relations, the kinds he picks out are fairly familiar from the literature on scientific explanation: we discover such relations as physical necessi- tation, being etiologically relevant, fulfilling a function, statistical relevance, and, in the fable of "The Tower and the Shadow," a relation of intentional relevance. We have been arguing that there are some relations that ought not to be allowed in any context as genuine relevance relations. Thus, there appears to be a distinction to be drawn between the relations that can serve, in some context or another, as relevance relations (paradigmatically those relations which figure in van Fraassen's discussions) and those which cannot (such as the contrived relations of the last two sections). How the distinction should be drawn depends on a very general issue about scientific explanation. Is there a set of genuine relevance relations that underlie the genuine why-questions for all sciences and for all times? Those who give an affirmative answer will see a full theory of explanation as offering a specification of the kinds of relevance relations that may underlie genuine why-questions. That specification would be strongly context-independent in that it would pick out the candidates for any given context of posing a why-ques- tion, and the candidates would always be the same. But perhaps there is no such invariant set of genuine relevance relations. The set of genuine relevance relations may itself be a function of the branch of science and of the stage of its development. Consider the abandonment of teleological explanations in physics after the scientific revolution. This can be viewed as a modification of the set of relevance relations: in the context of Aristotelian physics, the notion of teleological relevance was a genuine relevance relation, in the context of Newtonian physics it lost this status. Uniformitar- ians (those sympathetic to the view of the last paragraph) will deplore this relativism, contending that the notion of teleological relevance never was a genuine relevance relation and that its status was ex- posed during the scientific revolution. They will accuse relativists of confusing the variation in beliefs about relevance with the relativity of relevance itself. We do not need to settle this dispute because, on both accounts, there is a nontrivial task of distinguishing genuine relevance relations</page><page sequence="12">326 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY from the contrived relations of the last two sections. Just as pluralists about literary works will insist that there are many interpretations of Hamlet while denying that any reader's fancy counts as an interpre- tation, so too, relativists should concede that there are some rela- tions that are not genuine relevance relations at any historical stage of any science. The most thorough version of a relativist account of explanation would consist in specifying those principles which de- termine, for each historical stage of each science, the selection of certain relations as genuine relevance relations. A more modest (and more sensible) approach would be to consider some particular science (or sciences) throughout some particular period and to iden- tify the pertinent relevance relations. Thus, one might focus on con- temporary physics and try to distinguish the associated genuine rele- vance relations from the residue of relations-the contrived, the discarded, and so forth. Uniformitarians, ambitious relativists, and modest relativists all face the same kind of task. Although we do not know which version of the task he would wish to undertake, van Fraassen has remarked to us (in conversation) that he recognizes the importance of distinguish- ing genuine relevance relations and that he takes Aristotle's list of types of causes to be a promising start on drawing the distinction. We now want to suggest that completion of the task will require that van Fraassen solve most (if not all) of the traditional problems that have beset theories of explanation. For, depending on one's commitment on the large issue we have left unresolved, these problems take the form of showing why certain relations do not belong to the single set of genuine relevance relations which is associated with all sciences at all times, or of showing why certain relations do not belong to any of the sets of genuine relevance relations associated with different sciences at different times, or of showing, for some particular science(s) and period of interest, why certain relations do not belong to the associated set of genuine relevance relations. Henceforth, we intend that our presentations of problems should be systematically ambiguous among these forms.4 To simplify matters, we shall confine our attention to difficulties that arise in what Hempel would have viewed as deductive explana- tion. Consider the simple relation of derivation. This relation holds ' We are very grateful to an editor of this JOURNAL who raised a question which prompted us explicitly to distinguish these three ways of pursuing the theory of explanation and, thus, substantially to improve on the formulations of an earlier draft.</page><page sequence="13">VAN FRAASSEN ON EXPLANATION 327 between A and (Pk, X&gt; just in case there is a (first-order) derivation of Pk from A plus additional premises in K(Q). We can define any number of relations by imposing constraints on the kinds of state- ments that should figure in the premises. Thus, to recall a famous Hempelian example, let Pk be the proposition that Horace is bald, and R be the relation of Greenbury-school-board-derivation that holds between A and Pk just in case A is a conjunction of proposi- tions one of whose conjuncts is the proposition that Horace belongs to the Greenbury school board, Pk is derivable from A, and there is no conjunct in A that could be deleted while still enabling Pk to be derivable from the result. Suppose that X includes the propositions that Horace is bald and that Horace is not bald. Let A be the proposi- tion that Horace is a member of the Greenbury School Board and that all members of the Greenbury school board are bald. (Pk, X, R&gt; is a van Fraassen why-question to which A is a direct answer, and a perfect answer, to boot. We claim that the question we have just artificially constructed is not a genuine why-question and that A is no explanation of Horace's baldness. Moreover, we suggest that most (if not all) of the examples of nonexplanatory arguments that Hempel hoped to exclude-both those he succeeded in debarring and those which have caused per- sistent problems for the theory of D-N explanation-give rise to corresponding "relevance" relations that van Fraassen ought to ex- clude. As an illustration, let us return to his solution to the problem of the asymmetries of explanation in the light of what we have discov- ered about his treatment of why-questions. The proposition that the tower was built on the spot where the Chevalier killed his beloved and that it was built of such a height that its shadow would fall across the terrace where he first vowed his love is relevant to the topic of the question, "Why is the height of the tower h?" if we construe the relevance relation to be that of inten- tional relevance. That is just another way of putting the point that there is a perfectly good Hempelian argument that derives the height of the tower from premises about the Chevalier's attitudes and from psychological laws. But, if we are moved by the traditional problem of the asymmetries of explanation, what we want to know is whether there is a context in which the statement "The length of the shadow is 1" answers the question "Why is the height of the tower h?" in virtue of the fact that the assertion about shadow length, together with premises about the angle of elevation of the sun and the propa- gation of light [which may be relegated to the background K(Q)] favor the topic as against other propositions ascribing different</page><page sequence="14">328 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY heights. For that (or something very like it) is the translation into van Fraassen's idiom of the asymmetry problem that has bedeviled Hempel and his successors. Now, unless we impose very delicate constraints on relevance re- lations, it is easy to contrive a maximally well-founded question (Pk, X, R&gt; such that the proposition ascribing shadow length will be the core of a perfect answer. The trick should be apparent by now: take Pk to be the proposition that ascribes the actual height to the tower, let X be a collection of propositions ascribing different heights, let R be the relation of censored Hempelian derivation-a relation that holds between A and (Pk, X&gt; just in case there is a D-N argument that derives Pk from A plus additional premises in K(Q). (Quite evidently, we could impose additional constraints so as to rule out the use of the psychological principles on which van Fraassen's ac- count turns, and thus to ensure that the only available D-N argu- ments are those which invert the usual order of explanatory deriva- tion). We take K(Q) to be fixed in such a way as to include the proposition ascribing the elevation of the sun and the laws of propa- gation of light. This is surely quite reasonable, for some such K(Q) will have to be allowed if we are to countenance the proposition that the height of the tower is h as the core of an answer to the question, Why is the length of the shadow 1? So van Fraassen's theory allows explanations which correspond to those D-N explanations which intuitively "run the wrong way." We suggest that this is a mistake. Just as the contrived questions of sections III and iv should be eliminated by the imposition of con- straints on relevance relations, so too the question of the last para- graph and its accompanying perfect answer ought to be banished. For otherwise, van Fraassen's account of explanation will be defi- cient in exactly the way that Hempel's own treatment was. Every kind of asymmetry that arises for the D-N model can be generated within van Fraassen's framework. This means that, far from solving the problem of the asymmetries of explanation, van Fraassen presup- poses a solution to that problem. Thus, if we are right, van Fraassen has offered a beautiful treatment of the pragmatics of explanation which should be viewed as a supplement, rather than a rival, to the traditional approaches to explanation. VI As we have remarked (see note 3), there are many suggestions in van Fraassen's text that he does not intend to offer an "anything goes" account of explanation. In the last section, we have attempted to show that this intention ought to commit him to solving most (if not</page><page sequence="15">VAN FRAASSEN ON EXPLANATION 329 all) of the traditional problems of the theory of explanation. We want to conclude by considering an obvious question. If we interpret van Fraassen as supposing that there are constraints on why-questions and their answers, how does this affect the general argumentative strategy of The Scientific Image? Van Fraassen's discussion of scientific explanation is part of an effort to show that theoretical virtues beyond the saving of the phe- nomena are pragmatic. That argument eliminates a certain strategy for defending theoretical realism. If the realist proposes that (i) there is an objective criterion of explanatory power that distinguishes among empirically equivalent theories and (ii) theories with greater explanatory power have a stronger title to belief, then the doctrine of The Scientific Image appears to oppose the proposal by denying (i).5 If we are correct in our assessment of van Fraassen's position, then it seems that the realist can get at least as far as (i). For, if it is once granted that we can produce statements which favor the topic of a why-question but which do not stand in any objective relevance rela- tion to that topic (or, more exactly, to the ordered pair of topic and contrast class), then it appears that a theory may save the phenomena without generating answers to why-questions founded on genuine relevance relations. We have argued that, if he is to avoid the "anything goes" theory of explanation, van Fraassen must offer a characterization of objec- tive relevance relations which, in effect, overcomes the traditional problems of the theory of explanation. Now, within the traditional theories, there is ample room for prediction without explanations: we can have deductive arguments that fail to explain their conclu- sions, assemblages of statistical relevance relations that bestow high probability on a statement without explaining it. Once van Fraassen has introduced analogous distinctions within the theory of why-ques- tions and their answers, through the provision of constraints on genuine relevance relations that separate mere favoring from the adducing of relevant information, there can be theories yielding statements that favor the set of topics in a given class (or even imply those topics) without generating answers to any genuine why-ques- tion with any of those topics. We would thus have the basis for claiming that such theories are objectively inferior to their rivals that do furnish explanatory answers. 5 It is clear from a subsequent paper, in which he discusses Clark Glymour's views about explanation, that van Fraassen would also object to (ii). See "Glymour on Evidence and Explanation," in John Earman, ed., Testing Scientific Theories -(Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press), pp. 165-176.</page><page sequence="16">330 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY The consequence would be that van Fraassen would have to revise his account of what it is to accept a scientific theory by adding the idea that acceptance involves believing that the theory has explana- tory power as well as believing that it saves the phenomena (or, perhaps, believing that the theory offers the best tradeoff between saving the phenomena and having explanatory power)-indeed, he seems to take just this tack in the article cited in note 5. Since van Fraassen can still avail himself of a (different) distinction between acceptance and belief, this consequence should be seen as providing only the entering wedge for an argument for realism. We conclude that, if van Fraassen avoids the Scylla of the "any- thing goes" theory of explanation, then he is plunged into what he would view as the Charybdis of supposing that there is an objective virtue of theories distinct from their salvation of the phenomena. From our perspective, Scylla is (to say the least) uninviting, but Charybdis feels like the beginning of the way home.
