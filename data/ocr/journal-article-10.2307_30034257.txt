The metaphorical power of natural landscapes and geographical objects has at- tracted an increasing amount of critical interest. The myth of Dinocrates planning to carve Mount Athos into the figure of Alexander the Great epitomizes the complex relationship between the insistent materiality of prominent geographical features such as mountains and imagination. Through an iconographic reading of different renderings of the Dinocratic myth in western Europe, this article explores the way Mount Athos turned into a powerful emblem circulating across space and time. While considering the continuity of a Classical vision pro- jected on rock, the article focuses on its constant reappropriations and transformations in different historical and geographical contexts. Dinocratic Athos becomes a metaphor of ego- tism, power, and desire but also a free-floating referent, reflecting a shifting relationship be- tween the microcosm of the human body and the natural macrocosm. Keywords: Alexander the Great, Greece, Mount Athos, natural landscapes, reception theory. 7In the summer of 2002 an eclectic Greek American sculptor made headlines in the international press. He launched a campaign to carve a 73-meter-tall likeness of Alexander the Great into a Greek craggy cliff--"four times the size of the presidents of Mount Rushmore" (VRC 2002). At a time when Greek pride was smarting over the Macedonian question, Anastasios Papadopoulos and his supporters presented the colossal project as a true mission to render justice and honor to the memory of the man who "brought Hellenism [and thus civilization] throughout the known world" (Alexandros Foundation 2002) and to proclaim once and for all Macedonia's Greekness.1 Although nothing came of it, the "Mountain of Alexander the Great" was the object of an animated dispute. Besides the noble ideals of Papadopoulos's Greek American supporters, economic promises allured the mayor of Agios Geor- gios, a resort town on the Chalcidic peninsula. He hoped the project, complemented by a museum, an amphitheater, and a parking lot, would give new impetus to the area's declining tourist industry (Tzimas 2002). Environmental groups, however, threatened legal action "to protect the pine-clad province from turning it into a theme park" (VRC 2002). Aligned with them were Greek archaeologists and conser- * I would like to thank Denis Cosgrove for reading and commenting on the first draft of this article, two anony- mous referees for their valuable suggestions and insights, and Chris Eckerman for help with editing. *t DR.

Other Greek opponents, responding to Papadopoulos's patriotic claims, evoked the specter of a cold war-like rush to the biggest Alexander Mountain, a nonsense titanic competition: "should the neighboring country decide to start a similar project, where would that lead?" (VRC 2002). In its boldness, Papadopoulos's project is by no means original. From the top of Mount Kerdyllion, the craggy hill selected by the sculptor, one can distinguish the dark outline of a far more majestic cone looming on the horizon of the Singitic Gulf. According to the first century B.c. Roman architectural writer Vitruvius (2004, 2: 1-2), the peak of Athos, the mountain peninsula today occupied by the world's largest Orthodox Christian monastic community, captured the imagination of an even more ambitious and eclectic artist. Dinocrates, Alexander the Great's archi- tect in the fourth century B.c., proposed to carve Athos into a colossal human figure (by implication that of his patron), holding in the left hand a very extensive city (Alexandria) and in the right a bowl to receive the water of all the rivers in the mountain. Like Papadopoulos's, Dinocrates' project was never realized. Alexander's wisdom and rationality won out over the megalomania of the young architect. And yet the "Dinocratic myth" remained a powerful vision circulating across space and time: from the Classical world to the Italian Renaissance; from Revolutionary France to modern Greece. The "mountain of Alexander the Great" has been sub- ject of not only treaties, satires, and poems but also engravings, paintings, and, more recently, proposals for its realization. If on one hand it outraged ancient think- ers, Renaissance artists, and present-day environmentalists, on the other it has never ceased to stir imagination and desire. The image of Dinocratic Athos has been exploited in the construction of national discourses, to exalt papal power, or sim- ply to impart moral lessons. But why did Dinocratic Athos disturb and lure so much? This article investigates the complex intertwining of rock and imagination, be- tween geographical objects and moral values. More specifically, it speculates on the aptitude of "durable" physical objects such as mountains to be turned into meta- phors and circulated. Metaphors, Alison Blunt argued, are "inherently spatial in connecting two seemingly disconnected ideas to illuminate meaning with the term itself originating from the Greek word meaning transfer or transport" (Blunt 1994, 64). The metaphorical power of natural landscapes has been object of increasing numbers of publications, especially in the context of nation making (Nash 1994; Warnke 1994; Schama 1995; 0 Tuathail 1996; Peckham 2001; Olwig 2002), but less attention has been paid to the "transportation" of metaphors themselves across space and time. Through the exploration of different appropriations and render- ings of the Dinocratic myth, this study analyzes both movements: the two-way dia- logue between physical referent and meaning on one hand and the dynamics of a Classical "circulating vision" on the other.2 In the first case it considers how, through a two-way exchange between the natural and the human, through a continual pro-</page><page sequence="3">ALEXANDER THE GREAT'S MOUNTAIN 491 cess of embodiment and disembodiment, the Dinocratic myth materializes power and at the same time epitomizes the ancient cosmological conception of the human body as a microcosm (Tuan 1977, 88). Second, while tracing the history of the recep- tion of a topographical myth from ancient writings, it shows how, from solid rock, Mount Athos becomes a hybrid free-floating referent, changing meaning (and of- ten form) while moving through the complex circuits of culture. Over the past few years, there has been an increasing interest in issues of trans- lation and circulation of knowledge among historians of science and, more recently, historical geographers. Bruno Latour has demonstrated how knowledge about the world is "packed" and circulated through scientific practice, from the field to the laboratory, or what he calls "calculation centers" (Latour 1999, 24). As he has shown convincingly, however, "information is never simply transferred, it is always radi- cally transformed from one medium to the next.... It pays for its transport through a heavy price in transformations" (Latour 1998, 425). David Livingstone has taken the argument further and explored, from a geographical perspective, "what role specific locations have in the making of scientific knowledge" and, more specifi- cally, how "spaces both enable and constrain discourse" (2003, 1, 7). A key issue in the geographies of knowledge is the way in which theories (by means of texts) "are differently received and mobilized in different arenas" (Livingstone 2005, 393), how the public reacts and affects circulation-and often the text itself. Nicholaas Rupke has shown how "translations form a particularly good example of the perception that context of production and context of reading are two different things, because ... the translator imposes his/her reading on the new book, [ ... offering it] to a wholly new readership, far removed from the author in both geographical and cultural terms" (2000, 211). In art history, linguistic transla- tion can be compared with stylistic changes. After the so-called literary reception theory, in the mid-198os, the German art historian Wolfgang Kemp and others for- mulated a "visual reception theory," or "work-oriented reception aesthetics" (Da- costa Kaufmann 1996, 62). To the cartographies of textual reception explored by Rupke and Livingstone, one could therefore add cartographies of aesthetic experi- ence and change. An effort in this direction can be envisaged, for example, in Tho- mas Dacosta Kaufmann's recent book Toward a Geography of Art (2003). Drawing from art history and Classical studies, this article seeks to contribute to this approach and provide a potential point of dialogue between these disciplines and cultural geography in light of these recent debates. While not addressing specifi- cally issues of circulation, compelling attempts at linking Classical studies with mod- ern geographical discourse have recently been made by Denis Cosgrove (2001, 2003a, 2003b) and by William Koelsch (2004). Tracing the history of response and remodel- ing of an ancient topographical myth through iconographic analysis, this article also considers landscape representations (such as written texts; Livingstone 2005) as a medium for the circulation of knowledge rather than as text in the merely meta- phorical sense (Cosgrove and Daniels 1988). Never physically realized, Alexander the Great's Mountain remains an evocative fantasy in Western imagination. It remains a</page><page sequence="4">492 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW landscape of myth, and like any landscape, "a dynamic medium [of exchange] ... that is itself in motion from one place or time to another" (Mitchell 2002b, 2). ROCK AND METAPHOR Metaphor, Trevor Barnes and James Duncan argued, "touches a deep level of un- derstanding ... for it points to the process of learning and discovery-to those ana- logical leaps from the familiar to the unfamiliar which rally imagination and emotion as well as intellect" (1992, io). A bridge between the known and the unknown, meta- phors lie at the foundation of cognitive and scientific knowledge (Harvey 1996,164). Geographical metaphors permeate everyday speech: we talk about regions of knowl- edge, disciplinary fields, areas of interest, and so on (see Livingstone 2003, 6). Even more effectively, we employ geographical objects in a metaphorical sense to materi- alize the abstract, or quantify the indefinite: people cross oceans of space, reach the peak of glory, let themselves be transported by streams of thoughts, are overwhelmed by a mountain of work, and so on. If metaphors draw much of their effectiveness from material practices and experiences of the world, geographical objects are par- ticularly powerful (Harvey 1996, 164). As Antoine de Saint-Exupery wrote, they are "the most stable of all; in fact it is not very easy to remove mountains, or divert the course of a river, or turn the sea into mainland" (quoted in Farinelli 1992, 112; my translation). Metaphors help us reduce the unknown "to a visible, self-present, and docile object in space set before the eye of the subject to be mastered and managed ... to transform that which defies naming into manageable and exploitable objects" (Spanos 2000, 18-19; italics in the original): to turn "think" into "thing." The exchange between physical geographical objects and culture, matter and meaning, signifier and signified, however, is not one-way. It is, rather, a two-way dialogue, simultaneously representational and phenomenological (Debarbieux 1998, 422). Recently, increasing critical interest has also focused on "things" turning into "thinks." How does a known, defined object of nature come to embody abstract moral values or speak for human institutions? According to the historian Simon Schama, "once a certain idea of a landscape, a myth, a vision, establishes itself in an actual place, it has a peculiar way of muddling categories, of making metaphors more real than their referents; of becoming, in fact, part of the scenery" (1995, 61). Natural landscapes and geographical objects are not blank screens onto which cul- ture, or power relations, are simply projected. They are active protagonists in the process of signification. If it is true that "objects anchor time" (Tuan 1977, 187), one could easily argue that geographical objects, the most stable of all, crystalize myth. Not all of them, however, do, or do to the same extent. In Martin Warnke's words, "before I assign meaning to a natural object, I must first have been struck by its special qualities" (1994, 95). Primeval understanding of place (and thus the inscrip- tion of mythologies on it) "takes its point of departure and relates them to concrete natural elements, or things. Most ancient cosmogonies concentrate on this aspect and explain how 'everything' has come into being" (Norberg-Schultz 1980, 24; ital- ics in the original).</page><page sequence="5">ALEXANDER THE GREAT'S MOUNTAIN 493 Mountains, the most impressive and "fixed" physical features on earth, have become depositories of myths and legends across cultures and times (Thomas 1969, 475). The ancient Greeks considered them among the primeval elements of Cre- ation. In his Theogony, the Greek poet Hesiod attributed a central role to mountains ([eighth century B.C.] 1983, vv. 116-138). He related that they were the first things, with the ocean, created from the union of heaven and earth. For the ancients, "moun- tains, therefore, [were] understandably significant elements of the landscape be- cause of their age, size, and especially since, unlike rivers, they are the most unchanging" (Williams 1991, 79). Mountains were also often associated with titanic myths and (human) egotism.3 "Thessalian legends reverberate with the sound of the cataclysm as they recount how giants, attempting to scale the heights of heaven, piled rock on rock Ossa on Pelion" (Williams 1991, 477). In the modern Western imagination, mountains endure as the natural abodes of giantism, the ultimate act of "colonization of nature by culture, the alteration of landscape to manscape" (Schama 1995, 396). Natural giantism seeks "to unite the great individual with the landscape in a grandiose monumental form, so that it will appear superhuman and overwhelming" (Warnke 1994, 145). In Western culture, mountains have often been narrated as loci of desire and conquest. On one hand, their altitude provides "a rule against which men (for this was a distinctively masculine obsession) would mea- sure the stature of humanity, the reach of empire" (Schama 1995, 396; italics in the original); on the other, their rock evokes a sense of power and eternity: "it shows [man] something that transcends the precariousness of his humanity: as an abso- lute mode of being" (Eliade 1963, 216). MOUNT ATHOS Mount Athos is a paradoxical place. A 50-kilometer-long peninsula culminating in a 2,o33-meter peak (Figures 1 and 2), it started to be colonized by ascetics during the ninth century A.D. Maintaining its special status as a self-ruled monastic commu- nity under the Byzantine and Ottoman Empires, today it hosts more than 1,8oo Christian orthodox monks of different nationalities, dwelling in fortress-like mon- asteries and hermitages. Rough, wild, and isolated, Athos has traditionally repre- sented a spiritual refuge from the outside world, a place of humbleness and meditation on death, where patristic asceticism still finds its most severe expression (Speake 2002). Mount Athos, today better known as "Agion Oros" (Holy Moun- tain), nevertheless betrays a mythical pre-Christian past marked by hubris. Athos was the name of a rebellious Thracian giant who "hurled that whole stony mass at Poseidon in a clash between gods and giants" (Kadas 1979, 9; my translation). Athos also constituted the set for the most extraordinary human challenges to nature. According to the fifth century B.C. Greek historian Herodotus ([ca. 440 B.C.] 1987, 7: 22-24), after the famous Persian shipwreck occurred in 492 B.c. off Athos's tempes- tuous point, Xerxes, the son of Darius, decided to cut a canal on the neck of the peninsula, in order to avoid its circumnavigation and the repetition of a similar disaster.</page><page sequence="6">494 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW Macedonia 21 Bulgaria 24 270 Turkey Mount Kerdyllionw SAgie Georgies Qalcidic Peninsula.

(Cartography by the author) Because of its dramatic grandeur and inaccessibility, Athos was then chosen by Dinocrates for his bold project and became implicitly associated with Alexander the Great and his worldly power (the antithesis of the monastic ideal). Over the centuries the figure of Alexander mutated into one of the most pliant heroes that Western culture has spawned (Wilson-Chevalier 1997, 25). If his fantastic embodi- ment in the prominent Athonite cone exaggerated Alexander's eternal power, the Dinocratic myth itself, as narrated by Vitruvius and appropriated by other Classical authors, crystalized him as a champion of virtue. According to the Roman architect, Dinocrates' project was never realized, because the Macedonian king, from the height of his wisdom, declared it impracticable, for "as an infant is nourished by the milk</page><page sequence="7">ALEXANDER THE GREAT'S MOUNTAIN 495 FIG. 2-Majestic Mount Athos, in the Chalcidic Peninsula of northeastern Greece, has been the seat of metaphorical power and the subject of myths for thousands of years.

One of the main landmarks in the northern Aegean Sea, ancient Athos thus served as a repository of often contrasting metaphors. Human vices and moral teach- ings were projected on the mountain peninsula, making it not only an evocative hybrid of nature and meaning (Latour 1993) but also a powerful rhetorical device for Classical writers. Athos allowed a direct comparison between the figures of Alexander and Xerxes. The isthmus of the peninsula and the peak of the mountain came to embody opposite poles. Herodotus had criticized Xerxes' megalomania, asserting that the enterprise was primarily intended as a propaganda feat to show the extent of Persian power ([ca. 440 B.C.] 1987, 7: 22-24). Through the physical evidence of the canal dug in the rock, the "father of history" implicitly opposed barbarian arrogance (even before the forces of nature) to the Greek ideal of equilib- rium, to the peaceful conciliation between man and environment expressed in Clas- sical architecture (see Scully 1979). Athos stood metaphorically on the mythical boundary between the East and the West. It served as a powerful moral landmark, helping historiographers define the</page><page sequence="8">496 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW Orient, the great threatening "otherness" in Greek (and Western) imagination (Said 1979, 56-58). In The Persians, by the fifth century B.c. Greek tragedian Aeschuylus, the foolish and irrational figure of Xerxes incarnates an Asia that "speaks through. . . the European imagination, which is depicted as victorious over Asia, that hostile 'other' world beyond the seas. To Asia are given the feelings of emptiness, loss, and disaster that seem thereafter to reward Oriental challenges to the West" (p. 56). The "other" is projected on Asia, Asia on Xerxes, and eventually Xerxes on the canal-a memorial of his challenge to the West, to nature, and thus a monument to human foolishness.4 By contrast (and not without a certain irony), Alexander, the (mega- lomaniac) conqueror of Asia, came to epitomize western rationality. According to the Greek writer Plutarch (first century-early second century A.D.), he would have responded to Dinocrates: "Let Athos remain as it is. It is enough that it be the me- morial of the arrogance of one king" (Plutarch [A.D. 751 1925, 1: 17-20). While Alexander's words of wisdom reverberated through entire generations of Latin writers, the idea of Dinocratic Athos turned into a powerful vision challenging space and time. ATHOS AND THE VITRUVIAN BODY [Dinocrates] was, I should state, a man of tall stature, pleasing countenance, and altogether of dignified appearance. Trusting to the gifts with which nature had thus endowed him, he put off his ordinary clothing, and having anointed himself with oil, crowned his head with a wreath of poplar, slung a lion's skin across his left shoulder, and carrying a large club in his right hand, he sallied forth to the royal tribunal, at a period when the king was dispensing justice. The novelty of his appearance excited the attention of the people; and Alexander soon discovering, with astonishment, the object of their curiosity, ordered the crowd to make way for him, and demanded to know who he was. "A Mace- donian architect," replied Dinocrates, "who suggests schemes and designs wor- thy of your royal renown. I propose to form Mount Athos into the statue of a man holding a spacious city in his left hand, and in his right a huge cup, into which shall be collected all the streams of the mountain, which shall then be poured into the sea." --Vitruvius, [27-23 B.C.] 2004 The Dinocratic myth, narrated and appropriated by various Classical authors (for example, Plutarch [75 A.D.] 1914, 72: 8; [75 A.D.] 1925, 1: 17-20, Lucian [second cen- tury A.D.] 1905a, 26; [second century A.D.] 1905d, 115), owes most of its popularity in the West to Marcus Vitruvius Pollio. An aging military architect, Vitruvius presented Augustus Caesar, the new ruler of the Roman Empire, with his ten-book De architectura in the mid-2os B.C.E. Here the vision of the human body as a global microcosm was translated into architectural terms (Cosgrove 2ool0, 53). Almost un- known in antiquity, Vitruvius's work was rediscovered in the early fifteenth century and had a tremendous impact throughout the European Renaissance (McEwen 200oo3, 1). Vitruvius's conception of architecture as a scientia, or formalized, theoretically founded knowledge (Cosgrove 200oo3b, 22), became pivotal at a time when art, breaking from its subservient function, became "a mirror of measurable reality" (Kruft 1994,</page><page sequence="9">ALEXANDER THE GREAT S MOUNTAIN 497 41). It was in this context, and through humanist and courtly interest, that Vitruvius's treatise, along with Ptolemy's, became the focus of scholarly attention. These two works reflected, and yet at the same time legitimized, a new spatial perception of the kosmos as well as of the human subject (Cosgrove 2003b, 22). In 1450 Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472), a prominent Italian humanist, com- pleted the ten books of his De re aedificatoria, a foundation theory modeled on Vitruvius's work (Kruft 1994, 42). Like Vitruvius, Alberti conceived the human body as "the" architectural canon, or unit of measure.5 The building, he argued, is "a kind of body, consisting of lines and materials, in which the lines are produced by the mind and the material obtained from Nature" (Kruft 1994, 53; italics in the origi- nal). Alberti employed the body metaphor with architectural, but also political, struc- tures, such as the state. These, he said, are all held together by the idea that the members of the body are correspondent to each other. This organic metaphor was taken farther by the fifteenth-century Italian sculptor and architect Filarete, who compared a building to a living being in physiological terms, and later that century by Francesco di Giorgio Martini. Given the preoccupation with the Vitruvian man as the measure of proportion and the continual metaphorical exchange between body and inanimate matter, the Dinocratic myth as narrated by Vitruvius must have sounded particularly evocative to fifteenth century humanists.6 According to the Roman architect, Alexander the Great himself would have employed a powerful body metaphor, while comparing the city to an infant and the surrounding territory to the nourishing mother. For Alberti, however, the Dinocratic myth served primarily to alert the architect to the dangers and monstrosities to which he would give birth, should he dare to contra- dict laws of nature out of pure egotism ([1450] 1988, 6: 4). For Renaissance human- ists, Schama argued, the Dinocratic myth constituted a mythical negative model, a threat to the ideal combination of balance, harmony, and practicality. For example, "a commentator such as Buonaccorso Ghilberti was so embarrassed by the legend that he had Dinocrates ... withdraw the whole idea after second thoughts, offering elaborate explanations of its impracticability" (1995, 404). In addition to the traditional exaltation of Alexander's wisdom versus moral and artistic excesses, the Dinocratic myth provided Renaissance men with fertile ground for more subtle elaborations. In 1470 Francesco di Giorgio Martini of Siena, famous as painter, sculptor, and military architect, translated from Latin into ver- nacular (and for the first time published) Vitruvius's De architectura and wrote a famous architectural treatise containing profusely illustrated discussions on the machinery of architecture, fortifications, and harbors. Inspired by earlier writings, Martini attempted to work out "a system of ideal architectural proportions based on the form of the human body, with many drawings in which the human figure appears superimposed on the plans, facades, and details of religious buildings" (Weller 1943, 270). In his Trattati Martini employs the Dinocratic myth to demonstrate the neces- sity of anthropomorphism in urban planning (Fiore 1978, 69) and to exalt the vir-</page><page sequence="10">498 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW V! cirrt) ar At Vr,43 - (-,* jl- ~ 4 ~I F- .. ~ FIG. 3-Anthropomorphic rendering of the Dinocratic myth in Francesco di Giorgio Martini's Trattati di architettura, ca. 1476.

Returning to the original, one notes that Vitruvius pays particular attention to the physical description of Dinocrates. The young architect's naked body anointed with oil incarnates perfection. It is the body of Hercules, on which the head of Dinocrates has been applied (McEwen 2003, 127). It is through this body that Alexander's attention is captured, and the architect is given the chance to engage in a Herculean dialogue with the king, himself claiming descent from Hercules. The response he receives, however, makes Alexander even more Herculean than the Hercules' look-alike who stands before him (p. o101). Martini illustrates the Dinocratic myth in the Trattati with the drawing of a lan- guid, but well proportioned, nude male figure wearing a lion skin on his shoulders and holding a bowl in his right hand and a model of a fortress in his left (Figure 3). As the lion skin and the nakedness seem to suggest, the young man is likely to be Dinocrates, presenting himself to Alexander. The fortified citadel in his left hand, however, reveals a more subtle identification between the Macedonian architect and Martini himself, offering his patron Federico, duke of Urbino, his machines and his service as his military architect. It is to Federico that the Trattati are dedicated. In his Latin preface Martini glances briefly at ancient history, with which his humanist pa- tron was well acquainted, mentioning great conquering princes such as Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar. The latter tells us that he sometimes had the architect Vitruvius in his camp and treated him with great kindness and familiarity (Fiore 1978, 87). If Vitruvius, who addressed his De architectura to Augustus Caesar, had linked himself to Dinocrates and the Roman emperor to Alexander, Martini does not fail to perpetuate this historical chain of mutual trust between architect and patron. The nude youth, however, could be also identified as an anthropomorphic ren- dering of the colossus of Mount Athos, holding in its hands a bowl and a city. The youth's languid pose was characteristic of sculptural renderings of Alexander the Great in the Hellenistic period, and later also of Roman generals. Modeled on the male statues of Classical masters such as Polycletus (fifth century B.C.) and Praxiteles (fourth century B.C.), the standard Alexander pose is generally associated with Lysippus, a contemporary of the Macedonian king. It usually included a mantle hanging over the hero's right shoulder, a sword in his left hand, and a spear in his right (see Queyrel 1991). In Martini's Dinocratic representation, the bowl and the city may even have been a direct play on these two objects (and the lion skin on the mantle) in Hellenistic and Roman statuettes, with which the artist, himself a sculp- tor of mythological subjects, was surely well acquainted (Weller 1943, 66). Like the artist's drawings, ancient statues acted as material vehicles for the persistence and spatial diffusion of ancient visions: In as early as 1415 the Florentine priest and fa- mous cartographer Cristoforo Buondelmonti was exploring the Aegean in search of material vestiges of the ancient past, and in the 1440s the merchant and humanist Ciriaco d'Ancona started a profitable traffic in antiquities (including statues) be- tween Greece and Italy (Weiss 1964; Landolfi 1998, 444)- If we are to believe the Dinocratic myth, Dinocrates would probably have con- ceived his Colossus standing in a fashion similar to Martini's sketch, rather than</page><page sequence="12">500 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW sitting on the mountain (as in later renderings). The image of the mountain as a body, however, itself seemed to have a particular appeal to the Italian artist: "Dinocrates personally presented himself to Alexander, for he had heard Alexander wanted to edify a new city [Alexandria]; he therefore sketched Athos in the shape of a man holding in his left hand a cup into which all the veins of the body converged, and in the right the walls of the new city" (Martini [1476] 1967, 1: 10o; my transla- tion). The Sienese artist envisioned Athos as a living organism, his rivers and tor- rents constituting the circulatory system and converging in the bowl in his left hand. The living body of Dinocratic Athos magnified the conception of the human body as "a microcosmic measure of the world machine" (Cosgrove 2003b, 22). It exalted the western Renaissance idea that "man, called a little world, contains in himself all the general perfections of the whole world" (Martini [1476] 1967, 3: 17-19). Man, Martini argued, "touching things inanimate, in his nourishment and growth has affinity with plants, in his feelings with brute beasts, and lastly in his reason with the world of spirit; so that the Greeks came to call him a Mikrokosmos that is in himself a little world" (Martini [1476] 1967, prologue). The mythical fusion between culture and nature, between Dinocrates' traits and Athos's rock and forests, materialized the ideal of microcosmic man in the minds of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century hu- manists. In its absurd disproportionateness and impracticability, Dinocratic Athos gave visual consistency to an ancient dream. ATHOS AND THE PONTIFICAL BODY Though invoked as a negative architectural and moral model from Lucian to Alberti, Dinocrates' project never ceased to stir the Western imagination, and "the fantasy of a mountain colossus haunted the dreams of the superegoistical" (Schama 1995, 404). If early Renaissance humanists felt a little embarrassed at envisioning the Dinocratic monstrosity in their mind's eye, in the late seventeenth century all the conditions for its visual materialization seemed to exist. Baroque excesses and taste for theatricality took the place of the early Renaissance search for Classical beauty and equilibrium. Monumentality overcame proportions. Antiquarianism mixed with fascination for the curious and the exotic. Nature turned into spectacle; miracle into wonder; the Vitruvian man into the apotheosis of egotism. It is in this cultural context that Fabio Chigi, from Siena, assumed the papacy under the name of Alexander VII in 1655, and it is in this context that the Alexander Mountain was first represented "as if it had really existed" (Frankfort 1997, 249; my translation) and turned into a personal emblem (Figure 4). Shamelessly invoking Athos to flatter the egotism of his patron, Pietro da Cortona (1596-1669), official painter and architect of the pontifical court, took the Dinocratic obsequious tradition seriously. To the visual directness of the message, one must add the explicit play allowed by the name of the pope, here superimposed on that of the mythical Macedonian king-a common activity among ancient Roman emper- ors and the pope's own contemporaries (Metzger Habel 2002, 307). Pietro da Cortona wove together nature and the Chigian symbols through myth. Athos became the</page><page sequence="13">ALEXANDER THE GREAT S MOUNTAIN 501 pyramidal Chigian mountain, enlightened by the star and surrounded by the oaks of the Chigi coat of arms (Angelini 1998, 135). Through this subtle play of meta- phors and erudite associations, the artist probably intended to eulogize the vir- tuousness of his patron, paralleling Alexander the Great's refusal of Dinocrates' FIG. 4-Acquaforte by Pietro da Cortona representing Alexander VII and Dinocratic Athos, ca. mid-seventeenth century.

Alexander VII's modesty seemed, however, to have quickly vanished after his ascent to the papal throne, as lamented by John Bargrave, the soon-to-be canon of Canterbury:</page><page sequence="14">502 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW FIG. 5-Alexander VII's funerary monument in the Basilica of Saint Peter, Vatican. (Photograph by the author, winter 1997)</page><page sequence="15">ALEXANDER THE GREAT S MOUNTAIN 503 In the first months of his elevation to the Popedom, he had so taken upon himself the profession of an evangelical life that he was wont to season his meat with ashes, to sleep upon a hard couch, to hate riches, glory and pomp, taking a great pleasure to give audience of ambassadors in a chamber full of dead men's sculls, and in the sight of his coffin, which stood there to put him in mind of his death. But as soon as had called his relations about him he changed his nature. Instead of humility, succeeded vanity; his mortification vanished, his hard couch was turned into soft featherbed, his dead men's sculls into jewels, and his thoughts of death into ambition-filling his empty coffin with money as if he would corrupt death, and purchase life with riches. (quoted in Metzger Habel 2002, 8) The paradoxical combination of the former and latter natures of the pope is evoca- tively encapsulated in his tomb, a Baroque masterpiece by the sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598-1680) and the most imposing sepulcher in contemporary Europe (Figure 5). The remembrance of death and of the flowing of time, represented by a winged skeleton holding a sandglass, unveils a female personification of Truth lean- ing her left foot upon a terrestrial globe engraved with the Ptolemaic ecumene, sym- bol of the pontifical dreams of a universal Christian Catholic empire (Cosgrove 2001, 159-160). Counterbalanced by Charity and topped by a hieratic sculpture of the defunct pope, the funereal monument, with its precious marbles and golden inserts, does not fail to reflect the theatricality and pomp that Alexander yielded to during his pontificate. The corporality of stone, masterfully domesticated by Bernini and echoed in the mountain representations engraved on the coat of arms and on Alexander's robes (but also in the mountain-like stance of the pope himself),' gives his memory and deeds new consistency. At the same time, as with Pietro da Cortona's Athos, it tells us much about Alexander's greatest addiction: what his contemporar- ies named mal di pietra (stone disease). The pope's building mania ruined the state finances but allowed Alexander to become one of the great architectural popes. During the twelve years of his pontifi- cate (1655-1667), he changed "the map, the appearance and the image of Rome" (Krautheimer 1982, 1). Alexander aimed to embellish the capital in the same way the great emperors had done in the past, Caesar Augustus to start with. The topog- raphy of his Alexandrian Rome consciously echoed imperial Rome and, especially, the great capital cities of the late-antique Roman East. His Rome, arranged in stagelike squares such as the Piazza Navona, with its great global fountain, and scenic openings onto the great monuments of antiquity in all their glory, was a Rome conceived to strike the foreign visitor. Alexander's building policy, it has been observed, was aimed at creating an eminently political image of the city, at reasserting it (at least in popular imagination) as the world's capital it used to be. Alexander in fact "knew that the Church no longer carried the political weight it had possessed early in the century.... The wars of religion had failed. Newly domi- nant among the world powers, England and the Netherlands were both Protestant, and among the Catholic powers Rome no longer counted as a political force" (Krautheimer 1982, 31, 32).</page><page sequence="16">504 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW But although "the illustrious foreigner was taken from [piazza to piazza, or from] teatro to teatro" (Krautheimer 1982, 32; italics in the original), Alexander VII was parodied in the streets as the "papa di grande edificazione," "a biting word play not on his intellectual capacity and achievements, but on what some deemed his outra- geous building exploits" (Metzger Habel 2002, 8). We learn from biographers and ambassadors that "the pope [had] Rome in wood [obviously a model] in his bed- room as though nothing was more important to him than embellishing the city" (Krautheimer 1982, 12). Right after Alexander's death a satire depicts him in purga- tory, "designing amphitheatres and fountains to rebuild the place as he had done with Rome" (p. 13). From the top of the Quirinal hill, Alexander enjoyed a pan- oramic view of the city (Metzger Habel 2002, 299). To the Roman citizens who had to abandon their dwellings to make room for the open spaces of piazzas, the carto- graphic gaze of the pope might have had the same harmful effects averted by Christ on the Mount of Temptation (Matt. 4:8).8 To the foreign ambassador visiting the capital, the Chigian mount depicted on the omnipresent coats of arms engraved in monuments, plates, and coins might well have stood for the proverbial boldness and egotism of mountains (see Nicholson [19591 1997). In the good and in the evil, consciously and unconsciously, Pietro da Cortona's use of Athos was particularly well suited. Along with his tomb, Dinocratic Athos has probably remained the greatest memorial to the pope, to his legendary legacy with stone and his mal di pietra. Through his Athos acquaforte (etching), Pietro da Cortona managed to convey both the pope's pragmatism as an urban planner and his visionary character (Metzger Habel 2002, 310). Here Alexander seems to engage in an active and practical dia- logue with his flattering architects (Dinocrates and Pietro da Cortona). At the same time, as the upper inscription states, "his greater virtue makes art of [such] bold ventures." Alexandrian Rome is in fact also incorporated in the mountain. It is linked to Dinocrates' imaginary city (on the right hand of Alexander the Great) through a perspective line formed by the arms of the colossus and the copious river spreading down from his bowl into the sea. The river seems to flow forward, from mythical past toward a pragmatic present, joining the glory of the ancient world with that of contemporary Rome and the figure of Alexander the Great with that of the pope. This river of time (superimposed on the Tiber River?) seems also to convey the copiousness of pontifical wealth and creative power. Pietro da Cortona's Athos acquaforte served as a basis for an engraving by Frangois Spierre (1639-1681) dedicated to Alexander VII and six pontificates later recycled to celebrate pope Clement XI (1700-1711). In this process of copying, Athos lost most of its geographical and symbolic coordinates. It turned into pure stereo- type, into a free-floating metaphor more and more abstracted from its geographi- cal and historical context. Nevertheless, the symbolic legacy of Alexander VII with Athos remained unique. The evocative iconographic overlaps between Athos and the Chigian mountain, and between Alexander the Great and Alexander VII, effec- tively expressed the pope's unique relationship with stone, as well as his imperialis- tic aspirations and the presumed immortality of pontifical power.</page><page sequence="17">ALEXANDER THE GREAT'S MOUNTAIN 505 FIG. 6-Guillaume Chasteau after Ciro Ferri, Allegorical Portrait ofAlexander VII, ca. 1660 (Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica, Roma; reproduced courtesy of the Ministero per i Beni e le Attivith Culturali). </page><page sequence="18">506 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW  FIG. 7-Map of the Eastern Mediterranean and its ancient monuments in Johann Bernard Fischer von Erlach's Entwurff einer Historischen Architectur, 1712. (Reproduced courtesy of the Getty Research Institute's Special Collections and Visual Resources, Los Angeles) It was probably this fortunate coincidence of elements that encouraged artists like Ciro Ferri to explicitly associate Dinocratic representations of Athos with the pontifical body. A disciple of Pietro da Cortona, Ferri was part of a group of artists that comprised the best available talent in Rome (Davis 1986, 8) and to which Alexander VII repeatedly turned for fresco commissions. Like Cortona, and other artists at the pontifical court, Ferri produced a series of allegorical drawings that weave together sacred and mythological elements with Chigian iconography. In 1660, probably inspired by his master's Athos acquaforte, Ferri produced a drawing of his own allegory of the Alexander Mountain (Figure 6). Taking the place of Dinocrates' colossus, here Alexander VII is enthroned in the mountain. Almost one with rock, the body of the pope becomes the highest and most prominent of the seven hills of Rome, rendered by Ferri through allegorical figures that also embody different virtues. Just as in real life Alexander's cartographic gaze from the Quirinal dominates the city, here his rocky presence towers above the anthropomorphic hills (and thus human virtues). Alexander's imperial and com- manding gesture inspires awe and fear. In the Chigian oak (on the right), a putto holds the papal sphaera munda, reminding us of the universality of pontifical power, embracing earth and heaven, as stated in the dedicatory inscription.</page><page sequence="19">ALEXANDER THE GREAT'S MOUNTAIN 507 FIG. 8-Johann Bernard Fischer von Erlach's Dinocratic Athos in Entwurff einer Historischen Archi- tectur, 1712. (Reproduced courtesy of the Getty Research Institute's Special Collections and Visual Resources, Los Angeles)  ATHOS AND THE BODY POLITIC The mountain of Alexander the Great saw unprecedented popularity in seven- teenth-century Italy. It appeared on the frontispieces of theses as a symbol of ex- cellence, in curiosity cabinets, and in carnival parades (see Frankfort 1997). Assuming the most bizarre forms, it lost all contact with its original referent. At the beginning of the following century Johann Bernard Fischer von Erlach (1656-1723) attempted to return Dinocratic Athos to its original form and geographical coor- dinates. Among the most prominent representatives of Austrian Baroque, von Erlach had a long-standing interest in the history of architecture. In 1712 he published his Entwurff einer Historischen Architectur, an extraordinary atlas in which he illus- trated the whole development and diffusion of architecture through evocative en- gravings of different types of buildings. The seven wonders of the world and most of the great monuments of ancient Egypt, Persia, and Greece were reconstructed directly from myth and evocatively mapped back to their place (Figure 7). In the Baroque European geographical imagination, the eastern Mediterranean resonated with cyclopean enterprises whose traces survived only in myth. The temple of Diana at Ephesus, the Pharos of Alexandria, the Colossus of Rhodes, and the Tower of Babel are just a few examples. Placed outside the Chalcidic Peninsula, the illustra- tion of Mount Athos is represented as the Macedonian node of this mythical net of colossi.</page><page sequence="20">508 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW  FIG. 9-Frontispiece of Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan, 1651. (Reproduced courtesy of the De- partment of Special Collections, Charles E. Young Research Library, University of California, Los Angeles)</page><page sequence="21">ALEXANDER THE GREAT'S MOUNTAIN 509 Von Erlach's plate is probably the most evocative reconstruction of the Dinocratic myth extant (Figure 8). Here the body of Alexander is exalted through the combi- nation of rock, water, and vegetation. While remaining a bizarre, curiosity cabinet- like object, von Erlach's Athos can tell us much about the physical location of myth in the late Baroque geographical imagination. Alpine pine trees and Alexander's garments on one hand, and Egyptian palms and camels on the other, suggest Athos's imaginary setting on the border between two worlds: Greek antiquity and the Ori- ent.9 On von Erlach's representation, Athos stands in the middle of the Mediterra- nean Sea, between its familiar northern and exotic southeastern shores. Von Erlach's Athos is also emblematic of the relationship between nature and political power peculiar to the seventeenth century and the emergence of modern nation-states. Although, unlike other Baroque Dinocratic representations, this il- lustration served no explicit celebratory purpose, the colossal figure of Alexander can be easily reconducted to the same colossal tradition that inspired Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan (Figure 9). The illustration on the frontispiece of its 1651 en- graved edition expresses well what Kenneth Olwig (2002) names "the body politic," the state as "a sublimated force of nature" (p. 161). The monstrous Leviathan rises up beyond the mountains that tower above an extensive landscape. Since the seven- teenth century, "the scenic illusion of landscape made it easier to believe that differ- ent historically constituted polities and places could be unified within the space of a body politic as embodied by a geographical body" (p. 218). In the Leviathan repre- sentation, as well as in contemporary iconography, mountains symbolize princely liberality. As the Spanish diplomat and emblematist Saavedra Fajardo stated in 1640, "The mountains are the princes of the earth, being closest to the sky and superior to the other works of nature. Moreover, they resemble princes by virtue of generosity with which their great bowels slake the thirst of the fields and valleys with inex- haustible springs and so clothe them with leaves and flowers; this is the virtue most proper to a prince" (quoted in Warnke 1994, 91). In von Erlach's representation of the Athos colossus, all these elements are present. Alexander, the rocky Leviathan, generously lavishes water upon the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding area. Princely prodigality is also reflected in the abundant vegetal mantle on which his helmeted head is leaned. As in Hobbes's Leviathan illustration, here the city occu- pies a central position. If the body of the Leviathan was constituted by the sum of the citizens, here Alexander (the ruler) is one with the utopian city (and thus with its inhabitants), as well as with nature. It was this natural(ized) encounter between art and nature, human and nonhuman, individual and collective that has made the idea of natural giantism so appealing to Baroque artists and rulers-and to modern political theoreticians. If von Erlach's Athos, "among the last flickers of the rampant fantasy that found expression in the Baroque" (Hadjinikolaos 1997, 253; my translation), was an invol- untary vision of power, toward the end of the century Alexander's mountain be- came consciously political. In so doing, however, it once again lost any relationship with its original referent: from a bizarre physical object, it became a disembodied</page><page sequence="22">510 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW entity, a pure ideal. In 1796 Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes painted his own version of Dinocratic Athos, a benevolent reworking of Nicolas Poussin's (1594-1665) Polyphemus (Schama 1995, 404) (Figure lo). Here the mountain king ends up in the background, while "a group of figures in the foreground observe [him staring] calmly back from the summit" (p. 404). The traditional Vitruvian attributes of Alexander's Mountain almost disappear within its massive rocky body. Water and vegetation are transferred from the body of Athos to the surrounding bucolic landscape. It is to the whole tranquil scene, and no longer only to the body of Alexander, that the observer's gaze is now redirected. Athos ceases to be a mountain peninsula and becomes a purely fantastic mountain in the arcadia of Western imagination. The painting was exhibited at the salon of the republican year VIII, "when en- thusiasms were running high for both Hellenic purity and the cult of nature. Shrewdly marrying the two together, Valenciennes produced the perfect icon of benevolent republican sovereignty, where the impossibly exquisite landscape, ver- dant and gently watered, is shown directly dependent on the mountainous author- ity of the paternal state" (Schama 1995, 404-405). Initially conceived to display major works of historical painting commissioned by the state from members of the acad- emy, the salon played an important didactic and public role. The paintings exhib- ited in the salon informed the citizen, "from the palace to the farm cottage, of his glory, of his duties, and of public or private virtues, by either recalling fine actions or immortalizing the deeds of great men" (quoted in Mainardi 1993, 12). After the revolution, historical painting remained indissolubly allied with the major institu- tions of power. Neoclassical aesthetics became the official language of the republic. The architecture of public buildings spoke to citizens of the great Classical ideals of democracy, justice, and liberty. The mythological subjects of historical paintings and engravings were no longer antiquarian objects for curiosity cabinets; they were no longer "exotic othernesses" crystalized in time. Rather, they were active political and moral agents. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the history and literature of ancient Greece were used as an inexhaustible source of moral pre- cepts, exalted characters, and exemplary attitudes (Godlewska 1999, 278). Historical landscapes consisted of the combination of a fantastic natural set- ting, completely reconstructed by the artist, and a noble subject, usually taken from Classical antiquity (Godlewska 1999, 30). In representations like Valenciennes's, Athos and nature-or, rather, the Classical ideal of a noble and balanced nature-become moral and political agents. As Warnke (1994, 93) argued, "political fantasies repeat- edly attach themselves to the landscape, take hold of it, reshape it and adapt it to their needs." Hanging on the walls of the salon, the Mountain of Alexander in- spired its viewers with a sense of moral and social order, the same order inscribed into the harmonious Neoclassical facades of institutional buildings. If, as with Hobbes's Leviathan, natural gigantism nurtured the political fanta- sies of rulers like Frederick the Great of Ansbach, Lenin, and Mussolini, it had also democratic precedents, the earliest being the Colossus of Rhodes, towering over the plain as a symbol of democratic community (see Warnke 1994, 92-93). Perhaps it</page><page sequence="23">ALEXANDER THE GREAT S MOUNTAIN 511 was of the function of this colossus that Valenciennes was thinking while painting his benevolent Dinocratic Athos. "The irony is that Alexander, epitome of the ruth- lessly autocratic monarch, had now become an icon of republican virtues for the delectation of supporters of the French Revolution" (Speake 2002, 14). Such para- doxes, however, probably went unnoticed. The original referent had been lost in the perfection of Valenciennes's Arcadian landscape. His was an imagined, but ideal- ized, nature, detached from reality yet utterly real in its details; a nature able to FIG. lo-Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes, Mount Athos Carved as a Monument to Alexander the Great, ca. 1796. Oil on canvas. (Reproduced courtesy of the Art Institute of Chicago) disembody through the Enlightenment rhetoric of truth, through the verisimili- tude of its details collected in the green forest of Fontainbleau, rather than amid the barren hills of Greece. Through a curious loop, French-domesticated Classical landscapes bounced back to nineteenth-century Greece, becoming major protagonists of literature and na- tion making. In the newborn kingdom of Greece, integration was achieved textu- ally before it was realized politically. While heroic figures such as Alexander the Great were resurrected as symbols of unity, Greece's mutilated body was being re- stored through the natural setting of Romantic poems and novels (Dimaras 1971, 122-123; Peckham 2001, 4, 43). Though deeply patriotic, Greek Romanticism was first of all a French product (Dimaras 1982, 142). As Kolokotronis, the fighter of the War of Independence, observed, "the French Revolution and the doings of Napo- leon opened the eyes of the world" (quoted in Peckham 2001, 3). The culture that the Phanariots admired was French,'o as was their poetry, now celebrating a nostal- gic return to antiquity imbued with Romantic elements, now superimposing the figure of Napoleon upon that of Alexander (Dimaras 1982, 156; Beaton 1994, 24; Aikaterinides 1996, 31; Hadjinikolaos 1997, 22). Panagiotis Soutsos, one of the main exponents of Greek Romanticism, was him- self a Phanariot educated in Paris (Politis 1973, 139). His The Wayfarer, a tragedy in</page><page sequence="24">512 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW five acts, first published in 1831, is among the most emblematic products of this movement. A "recognizably imported confection ... solidly anchored to the Greek world" (Beaton 1994, 38), The Wayfarer is dominated by a continuous intertwining of the inner tragedy of the protagonist, persecuted by the ghost of his abandoned beloved, and sublime natural settings. Through his pen, Soutsos gives life to inert landscapes, transforming natural monuments into monuments of the new nation. Lost in the ecstatic contemplation of Athos, where most of the tragedy takes place, the wayfarer weaves one of the most impressive hymns of modern Greek literature (Lephas 1991, 169), awakening the Dinocratic giant from a long oblivion (Soutsos 1842, vv. 51-64, quoted in Lephas 1991, 192; my translation): Crystaline Athos! Bewildered I stare at you, and admire your giant stature. You stretch your roots to the guts of the Earth, and join the dark hell with the heavens. A diamonded diadem crowns your summit, the woods are your belt, the clouds your hair, the lighting your gaze, the torrent your voice, the whirlwind your rumbly breath. Like the first man of creation, first you took life, and last among all you are to offer your neck to murdering time. You look at the dust of time flowing below you. No cataclysm ever washed your face away; the sea kisses your feet. Soutsos's Athos embeds a true Humboldtian microcosm. The immutable rocky cone assumes anthropomorphic traits: From the height of his immortality, the giant ob- serves the caducity of mankind, takes the word, breathes. Within the colossus's body, Aristotelian elements mix all their drama. Rock and vegetation, torrents and waves, thunder and lightning-all fuse into a creature at once eternal and pulsating with life. As in von Erlach's representation, the microscale of the human organism and the macroscale of the cosmos collapse in the majesty, but at the same time in the circumscription of this amazing geographical object. Athos becomes an emblem of Hellas's body politic, at once an eternal monument and a dynamic creature. Athos becomes a naturalizing link between human transience and the immortality of a newborn nation-state, and also between Greek religious sentiment and European Romantic sensibility (Blachos 1874, 14-15). TRAVELING LANDSCAPE METAPHORS If landscape is "a medium of exchange between the human and natural, the self and the other" (Mitchell 2002a, 5), geographical objects are among the most powerful instruments for crystalizing myths and naturalizing national discourses-themselves myths (Peckham 2001). This article shows the continuity and evolution of a Classi- cal vision through a number of complex interplays: between matter and imagina- tion; between the scale of the human body (Alexander, Vitruvius, the pope), of a geographical object (Mount Athos), of the nation-state (France and Greece). It has</page><page sequence="25">ALEXANDER THE GREAT'S MOUNTAIN 513 looked at Dinocratic Athos as an emblematic hybrid of human and nonhuman, and also at its mobile genealogy. As Livingstone (2003) suggests, all knowledge is knowledge in place, produced and circulated in specific geographical and cultural contexts. But geographical-and historical-movement "is never simply a relocation; migration always involves modification," either in form, or meaning-or both (Livingstone 2005, 392). Uni- versal models traditionally envisioned in myth and nature are also subject to this process of continual appropriation, transformation, and resignification, depending on the contexts through which they are moving. Rather than a passive dispenser of eternal metaphors, Dinocratic Athos can thus be interpreted as a metaphor in itself. (Re)produced in Martini's utopian fortified city, in Alexandrian Rome, in Baroque Vienna, in revolutionary Paris, or even in the contemporary, money-driven tour- ism industry of northern Greece, the Mountain of Alexander the Great casts light on shifting perceptions of nature and the body in western Europe: from the balance sought in the Classical world to the bizarre wonder encountered in the Baroque, from the Neoclassical idyll to Romantic drama, and, finally, commodified mon- strosity. Embodied and disembodied, Dinocratic Athos remains a vision, a land- scape of myth, a geographical object no longer as solid as its rock, but as fluid as the waters and meanings that surround it. NOTES 1. The bold idea was initially conceived by Papadopoulos in 1996, at the height of Greek nation- alist resentment against the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. The dispute arose in 1991, when Yugoslav Macedonia proclaimed its independence. "The Greek government announced that it could not accept an independent country with the historic Greek name of Macedonia, or one which used any of the symbols of ancient Macedonia, including much of Northern Greece" (Agnew 2001, 23). In addition to the various territorial issues, the dispute soon turned into a true war on symbol property, the Greeks as the legitimate inheritors of the ancient Greeks claiming monopoly on ancient Macedonian symbols and thus accusing their neighbors of usurpation. The figure of Alexander the Great, the quintessential incarnation of Greek civilization, soon became synonymous with the slogan and served "as the final stamp of authenticity for the Greekness of Alexander" (VRC 2002). 2. On the duration of myth and the recurrence of Classical motives in Renaissance and Baroque art, see the work of the famous art historian and iconographer Aby Warburg ([1932] 1999). 3. This negative attitude toward mountains was also typical of the Middle Ages and lasted until the Romantic appraisal of sublime sceneries (see Nicolson [1959] 1997). 4. Xerxes' canal remained proverbial, as did the powerful paradoxical image of navigating Athos and marching on the Hellespont evoked by the fourth century B.C. Greek writer Isocrates and repeat- edly exploited by the rhetorician and satirist Lucian of Samosata-"And Unendingly Let Athos Be Crossed in Ships and the Hellespont Afoot" (Lucian [second century A.D.] 1905b, 140; see also Lucian [second century A.D.] 1905C, 226). 5. This powerful metaphor was later visually rendered by Leonardo da Vinci's famous encircled Vitruvian man. 6. Among the ancient authors reporting the Dinocratic myth, Vitruvius is the one who gives the strongest emphasis to the bodily element. He is also the only one to provide an accurate description of Dinocrates and his body. 7. Note the correspondence between the head of the pope in the monument and Athos's peak on Pietro da Cortona's drawing, both of them topped by the Chigian star(s). The movement of the drap- ing-and thus of time-is also reflected in Cortona's Athos representation by the flow of the river.</page><page sequence="26">514 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW 8. Because of its striking height, popular traditions identify the Mount of Temptation with Athos. 9. Von Erlach's fascination with the East and the notion that civilization spreads out from the eastern Mediterranean region is apparent in the arrangement of the contents of his History ofArchitec- ture, where he progressively moves from Jerusalem, Greece, Egypt, Cyprus, and so on to the Middle East (Arabia and Persia) to the Far East (China, Japan, and so on). In the text accompanying the Athos engraving, he compares the Dinocratic project with two analogue examples: the goddess Fu, carved in a mountain of Suchen Province in China, and the Semiramis legend, according to which she ordered to have her bust and that of many other figures hewn out of a rock in the mountains of Media. This latter anecdote is reported also by Ciro Ferri, on the engraving of his Pontifical Athos. 10o. Phanariots were the Greeks of Constantinople, the most educated elements of the new nation and mainly responsible for the Greek Romantic movement. REFERENCES Aeschylus. [472 B.C.] 1981. The Persians.
