<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRIAL KV (1969), A MIDDLE MINOAN BUILDING AT KNOSSOS (PLATES 27-32) THE excavation to be described below was an emergency undertaking and no more than a test in size and purpose. The finds, though by no means spectacular, were considerable in number and, being mostly contemporary, deserve publication despite the provisional nature of the ex- cavation.' A villager planting tomatoes at Knossos brought to light a mass of plain pottery in the field of Michaelis Phrondarakis, situated in plot no. 2173 on the Greek Economic Survey (1950) Plan of the village; the locality is called Sochara and lies on the rising ground above the village coffee-shops, almost due west of the Palace. The discovery was reported to the Greek Archaeo- logical Service which, after a little digging, collected much pottery and some plaster objects. Considering the site deserved fuller investigation, the Ephor, Dr. St. Alexiou, invited the School to carry out this work as a matter of urgency. The excavation, which took place in the summer of 1969 under the supervision of the author, was mainly limited to investigating a small area, 5 metres square. It uncovered three small rooms or compartments, one in its entirety, measuring 1 -60 by .50 m., and parts of two others adjacent to it to the north and south, FIG. I and PLATE 27. Interconnected by narrow slots they appeared to be basements inside a substantial building. The compartments were built of stone abutting against the thick outer wall of this substantial building, PLATE 27C, and, in two cases, their paved floors were preserved, lying some 70 cm. below the present rock surface. The purpose of these unusual constructions is not certain but they seem to be part of some water-system, their interconnecting slots being 'conduits' between 'cisterns'. Apart from their plan, three other features suggest this interpretation. Above the paved floor of the central com- partment a layer of fine earth had accumulated before the main fill (probably a destruction deposit) fell or was thrown into it; this layer could well represent a partial silting up (FIG. 2, level 9). Secondly, a water-channel was found below floor level in the north compartment, where the paving slabs had been removed; it had been blocked by the construction of the south wall of this room, suggesting the existence of an earlier and much smaller water-system in the same area (FIG. 3). Finally, the paved floors of the central and southern 'cisterns' show a slight slope down from north to south, as does the earlier channel. Several stages of activity were revealed by the excavation. The existence of an early water- channel has just been mentioned; its continuation into the central compartment was demon- strated when we lifted one of the paving slabs there (FIG. 3). It was largely silted up with dark earth containing much carbon (FIG. 2, level io) and the construction of the party-wall between the northern and central rooms had blocked it. After the compartments had been built and after some silt had accumulated in them (FIG. 2, level 9), a disaster befell the building, or at least this part of it. I The material from Trial KV (an abbreviation for Knossos Village) is now housed in the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos. The excavation lasted nine days and was carried out by two workmen under the supervision of the author assisted towards the end by Mr. L. H. Sackett and Mr. K. McFadzean. Col. de Quincey kindly made the plan and architectural sections upon which those pub- lished here are based.

The southern compartment, too, or the small part of it ex- cavated, contained burnt mud-brick, much fragmentary wall-plaster, and some carbon but little pottery. The vases in the central room were in some kind of order: the larger pots lay below with some concentration in the eastern part; at a higher level, and mainly in the north and centre, were small cups and saucers, while jugs were found mostly in the south; some of the saucers and cups</page><page sequence="3">TRIAL KV (1969), A MIDDLE MINOAN BUILDING AT KNOSSOS 183 A 1 3 6 7 8 WALL 4 a 02 .O 10 PAVED FLOOR 9 N S B ROCK .LEVEL DATUM.

Again, it is doubtful if vases would have remained en rouleau had this been a deliberate fill of destruc- tion material brought from elsewhere. The obvious explanation is that it is fall from an upper storey following the collapse of the floor. Difficult, however, to explain, are the few stones in the fill suitable for floor slabs (unless the upper floor was of timber) and the number of stones</page><page sequence="4">184 MERVYN R.

Subsequently there was some reconstruction represented by remains of walls and perhaps flooring in the upper level of the southern compartment, just below present surface soil (FIG. 3 and PLATE 27e). To the east of this a pit had been dug, presumably for stone-robbing; it con- tained LM I pottery and presumably post-dated the reconstruction. The northern room had been cleared out, much of its paved floor removed, and first a pebble, later an earth floor laid (FIG. 2 levels 7 and 8): the dark colour of its floor suggested it had been a kitchen area and this was confirmed by the finding of tripod and other cooking-pots there. The</page><page sequence="5">TRIAL KV (1969), A MIDDLE MINOAN BUILDING AT KNOSSOS 185 pottery was LM I in type (PLATE 32g); some of it had penetrated even into the runnel to the south. The fill of this room consisted largely of building-stones, though it was unclear whether these represented a further destruction (FIG. 2 level 6). Later, a well had been sunk through the fill of this room and through its floor: there was no opportunity to ascertain its date. Finally, a large pit had been dug, presumably to find building-stone, which had removed much of the east wall in the central compartment and the east part of its north wall. The pit had been filled with small stones, earth, and refuse containing much pottery: this fill appeared to be late Classical in date (FIG. 2, level 2). We made a few small tests in an attempt to define the size of the Middle Minoan building. These were marked on a field plan.2 South of the main excavation the thick outer wall of the building has been robbed completely, but the rock cutting for its foundations and for the south wall at right angles to it were located. North of the excavation the rock cutting was again traced but the one surviving wall in this region ran parallel to but slightly west of it: the reason for this could not be determined. An attempt to locate the eastern limit of the building suc- ceeded in finding a stout wall but its stones were bonded with plaster: though obviously later, it might be a rebuilding on the line of the original wall. 1 2 3 FIG. 5. VASES FROM SILT LEVEL. Scale I: 3 THE MATERIAL3 I. The 'silt' level (FIG. 2, level 9): The earliest pottery stratigraphically was that contained in the shallow level, possibly silted earth, which covered the paved floor of the central and southern compartments. Unfortunately it was difficult to separate from the destruction material, the stones of which had penetrated into the lower level and somewhat confused it. Five vases, however, were found in it and most probably belonged with it. They are: a large part of a polychrome cup with three small feet, P I (FIG. 7, and PLATE 30 b-c), and four mono- chrome pots (FIG. 5), a cup, a shallow saucer, and two small bowls. The latter are finer in shape and fabric than the bowls in the destruction material: one has an applied white line along the rim. Parallels to these vases suggest that this level accumulated during the MM II period, prob- ably during the later phase of it, though the material is too limited for any firmer conclusion. 2. The destruction level (FIG. 2, level 5): Nearly all the pottery of this level was found in the central room though some came from the runnel between it and the south compartment, which itself contained only sherds. The deposit in the central room reached as high as the surviving walls, PLATE 27b. There was some confusion near the top of the deposit, and a large pit on the east edge had removed a considerable part; otherwise the deposit seemed homogeneous and undisturbed. Mention has been made above that the vases appeared to retain some kind of order: this 2 Mr. K. McFadzean made a field plan on which were plotted all the trials, walls, and surface indications. This is not reproduced here but may be consulted in the archives of the British School at Athens. 3 A catalogue of selected vases will be found at the end of this article; some references to comparative material are quoted there.</page><page sequence="6">186 MERVYN R. POPHAM could reflect the position in which they had been stored in an upper room, with larger vases on or near the floor and the small cups and saucers on shelves above. Nearly 150 vases were whole or capable of restoration and there were large parts of some 200 more. To these may be added several fragments of a large terracotta lamp and of eight small ones. Other finds were few; several pieces of plaster 'hearths', a fragmentary stone lamp, the skeleton of a human foetus, sea-shells in considerable numbers, and animal bones. Most of the pots are monochrome or plain and clearly represent the common and inexpen- sive tableware of the time, mass produced and clumsily made. The chart below sets out the most common shapes and their numbers.

They regularly display marked ridges on the interior, made by fingers during fashioning, and string marks on the flat base which show how they were cut off the wheel or off the parent clay. Most are coated inside and out with a matt orange-red paint or have a slightly metallic dark-brown lustre, but the colour varies as in the case of the cups to be described below. Splash decoration is exceptional. A few finer-made examples have a sharper and better defined rim (FIG. 6, 8). Cups Those with a rather bell-shaped profile, PLATE 28a-f and FIG. 6, 11-14, are by no means uniform in size, though, again, most are of medium capacity. With or without a handle, they are roughly made, often uneven in shape and, like saucers, they frequently have heavy ridges on the interior and string marks on the base. Their colour, as painted both inside and out, is usually matt orange-red; the paint, however, often ranges from black or brown to a light fawn. A few have a rather metallic dark-brown to black finish. These are sometimes small, better made, with thinner walls and with a strap handle instead of the customary 'vestigial' type, FIG. 6, 15 PLATE 28d. The handleless cups are, perhaps, more frequently pale brown in colour, with their paint fired in patches to black or brown. Two examples with splash decoration, FIG. 6, 18 and 22, PLATE 28i, are exceptional. Straight-sided cups are much less common: most are painted matt brown, while some are decorated with added splashes of white paint, FIG. 6, 2 and PLATE 28g,j. A few of them are thin- walled and without interior ridges, while all have strap handles. Only one monochrome painted conical cup, FIG. 6, 10, was noted though there are several plain examples. Jugs (PLATE 3od and FIG. 6, 24-5) Jugs are few.

POPHAM paint and all were probably decorated with white splashes, though in some cases this is not now visible. They have a small funnel-shaped neck and so differ from the one large jug with its beak spout P 2 (PLATE 29b). This vase too is decorated with white spots on a rather matt black paint. The neck, handle, and shoulder of a medium-sized jug is likely to belong to the same deposit (PLATE 3IC). Other painted wares Other shapes are rare. Two bridge-spouted jars could be restored. One, a fine polychrome vase P 3 (FIG. 7, 2 and PLATE 29a), has a geometricized octopus on either side; the other P 4 is much coarser and monochrome black, PLATE 29g. A tall jar with pinched-out spout P 5 (PLATE 29c) is coated with a smooth orange-red matt paint which is mottled red in places. Two tall tubular-spouted jars were in part reconstructed, P 6 (PLATE 29e-f), and there were frag- ments of several others. They all have crude splash-and-trickle decoration in dark paint on 1 2 FIG. 7. (I) DECORATED CUP FROM SILT LEVEL. (2) POLYCHROME JAR FROM DESTRUCTION LEVEL. Scale I: 3 the clay base. Large fragments exist of basins or bucket-shaped utensils with vertical handles, PLATE 32b and d. One of these has white splash decoration on an orange-brown base, the other a spiral in white on black. The collar-necked jar P 7, PLATE 29d, with applied white bands and large white discs on the belly, is, to judge from other fragments, typical. There is also the upper part of an oval-necked amphora, PLATE 3IC. The other decorated sherds, illustrated in PLATE 3Ia and c, are small and individual pieces with no firm association with the main deposit; they are mostly decorated with white dots on a black base. PLAIN UNPAINTED WARES These form a small proportion of the whole. The pots are mostly of an orange and sandy fabric though a few are made of the usual fine buff Knossian clay and have a smooth finish. There is only one vase, and no other sherds, in a coarser, dark-red, hard-baked, cooking-pot fabric, a one-handled jug with pinched-out spout, PLATE 32f. The types of vase represented in this category are illustrated in FIG. 8. There are fragments of eight cups of the conical type resembling nos. I and 7: eight with rounded profile as no. 2.</page><page sequence="9">TRIAL KV (1969), A MIDDLE MINOAN BUILDING AT KNOSSOS 189 Heavy thick-walled cups, as no. 8, are few, four in all. Saucers and shallow bowls are also rare, three like no. 3 and only one in finer ware, no. 6. Finally, the deposit contained parts of eight small lamps of the sandy orange fabric, all with stick handle and practically identical, no. 9 and PLATE 32h. OTHER FINDS There were not many objects in the deposits other than pottery. There is the most part of a stone lamp, PLATE 3Ib, which is discussed by Dr. P. Warren in Appendix I. It was part of the 1 2 3 6 5 4 7 8 9 FIG. 8. PLAIN VASES FROM DESTRUCTION LEVEL. Scale I: 3 main deposit in the central room. From the same context came much of a large clay lamp, lacking its pedestal, PLATE 32C. It is decorated with retorted spirals painted in white over the general dark-red base, and its rim diameter is 25'5 cm. In Appendix II Dr. J. Younger comments on a pithos sherd with a seal impression, PLATE 32e, which was found by the Heraklion Museum authorities in their initial surface exploration and which may well be Archaic in date. An interesting fragment of pottery may have been part of an anthropomorphic vase with a handle, PLATE 31 d. At least on its neck is clearly depicted in relief a necklace on which traces of colour survive, red on the upper row of beads, blue on the pendants, and yellow on the spacers. Several large fragments and many small pieces of clay-and-plaster tripod hearths or 'tables of offerings' lay scattered throughout the main deposit in the central compartment.4 There were originally at least three since nine feet were found. These objects were first fashioned in clay 4 On these tables of offerings, or tripod hearths, see Evans, PM ii 283, and Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean Religion 103, who list instances of their occurrence and agree that they could have a cult, domestic, and funerary use. Their manu- facture must have required specialist skill in which, perhaps, the artisans of Nirou Chani excelled in LM IB since the forty to fifty found in the mansion there seem excessive for anything other than a store intended for sale or export. In our case, a cult use is perhaps supported by the large number of sea-shells and possibly the human skeleton found in the same deposit.</page><page sequence="10">190 MERVYN R. POPHAM heavily laced with straw and then sun-baked; later a layer of fine plaster was applied over this core thinly spread over most of the surface but thicker on the bottom to which were applied three short feet of plaster. Most of the fragments are painted dark red though that restored in drawing at FIG. 9 is more ambitiously decorated with a red base and a black rim, and a row of white circles with black discs in their centres around the exterior. Several pieces bore signs of blackening on the top, clearly resulting from use. Much very fragmentary wall-plaster was in the fill of the small part we excavated of the south room. Most is painted in plain white, but some pieces are covered with an orange-light-brown paint. The remaining objects, shells and the skeleton of a human foetus, will, it is hoped, be the subject of study elsewhere. FIG. 9. CLAY-AND-PLASTER HEARTH FROM DESTRUCTION LEVEL. Scale 1:3 THE DATE OF THE DEPOSIT The size of the deposit and the range of vases represented in it might reasonably be expected to make its dating a simple matter. That this is not so is largely due to neglect in publishing ordinary household pots on the part of excavators in central Crete, whose attention has not unnaturally been focused on the much more attractive fine and decorated pottery of the Middle Minoan period. There appears to be only one group of similar vases published from Knossos. It was found by Forsdyke in a pit in Mavrospelio Tomb XVII. In his publication of this group of mainly undecorated pots, Forsdyke ascribes them to the MM IIB phase, and the same vases are used by Evans to illustrate the domestic pottery of the same period. Pendlebury, too, repeats the identical deposit and dating.s In none of these instances is any comparable material cited or any reasons given for the classification adopted. Some help is forthcoming from the decorated wares in our deposit though they are very few, one whole vase and some large fragments, which may be assumed to be contemporary with the much more numerous ordinary vases. Parallels for the bridge-spouted jar with its geometricized octopus design P 3, FIG. 7, 2, are hard to find.6 A vase of similar shape and comparable decoration was found in the Kamares Cave but its unstratified context does not assist in dating. Two cups, however, from the First Palace at Phaestos bear related designs, and other parallels from the same context are to be found for certain features on two of our large decorated fragments, the 'thorn' filling in red s Mavrospelio Tomb XVII (pit) is published by Fors- dyke in BSA xxviii (1926-7) 278 and pl. xxiii; note the small tripod vase: the group is repeated by Evans in PM ii 558 fig. 353 and called MM IIB: so repeated by Pendle- bury AC 139. 6 See note 3.</page><page sequence="11">TRIAL KV (1969), A MIDDLE MINOAN BUILDING AT KNOSSOS 191 on that at PLATE 32a and the palmette terminals and red 'tennis-racket' fill on the sherd at PLATE 30C.7 Unfortunately for our purposes there is no universal agreement on the number and date of the destructions of the First Palace at Phaistos, though some of our parallels are in deposits which have been placed in the MM IIB phase.8 Further help should be forthcoming from the tripod cup P I at FIG. 7, I, but no similar vase appears to have been published, though a related shape is to be seen in a plain vase in the Mavrospelio deposit. It cannot be claimed that we have succeeded in establishing any firm basis for dating our deposit and it would, therefore, seem best to retain for the time being the classification of Forsdyke and Evans and to call it MM IIB. Only the publication of a similar group from Knossos, but one with a far greater proportion of fine, decorated vases, will show whether this classifica- tion is acceptable or should be modified.

Its material and general parallels in shape indicate that this stone vessel was probably a lamp.9 It is an interesting addition to the smallish group of stone lamps of the period of the First Palaces (MMI-II).,o Its simple undecorated form is normal at this time but there are no close parallels for the shape.," The form is intermediate between low stand lamps with moulded base and higher, pedestal types. These two distinct forms are standard in MM III-LM IIIA, but in the earlier period, MMI-II, there is much variation. An example from Knossos with a broad bowl and flaring pedestal is of MM IA date, while the First Palace at Phaistos has produced low forms with no pedestallz and another with a thick pedestal and a bowl in the shape of a double axe.'3 The new Knossos vase, low but with a pronounced conical foot, adds to the variety of forms. Furthermore, it may be that the standard MM III-LM IIIA low type of lamp with moulded base evolved from lamps like this MM II piece. The material is the blue/black serpentine used for the great majority of Minoan lamps and for about 36 per cent of all Minoan stone vases.I4 The source of the raw material for the Knossos region may well have been the extensive deposits near Gonies, west of Tylissos and Sklavo- kampos, known from MM I onwards.1" P. WARREN 9 This is not at all certain, however. The tiny lug pre- served below the rim at one point would normally be at right angles to any wick cutting, for which there is room here at the right place on the preserved top of the rim. But no wick cutting appears here or elsewhere. Hence it is very possible that the whole rim was plain and that the vase was a libation table. xo Warren, Minoan Stone Vases (Cambridge, 1969) 50-2, henceforth MSV. Ix MSV pls.
