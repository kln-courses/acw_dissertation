Montero Observers of a certain aspect of the Parisian scene as well as students of Spanish American literature and its continental echoes should note the recent presentation at the "Petit Orsay" of Severo Sarduy's play La Playa , Der Strand in a German version (1971), now La Plage in Paris. Originally written as a piece for the radio, Sarduy has said of his text, composed while on vacation in Cannes, "puse más o menos todo lo que oía o veía (la publicidad, por ejemplo, que llevaba un avión en la cola, escrita en una larga banda, o una can- ción de Joao Gilberto." 1 The play is set on a beach whose props, sunbathers, suntan lotion, lounge chairs, serve as catalysts for the verbal shuffles that make up a text that is a memory transformed into discourse. According to a note attached to the program, it obtained in 1970 the "Prix Paul Gilson de la Communauté Radio- phonique des Programmes de Langue Française." For the listener, the words flowing out of the receiver must have built a unique verbal fantasy, first triggered by the authors own reverie of words then complementing it. However, what goes on in Paris, beginning March 8, 1977, is a dramatization of this "play" adapted and directed by Simone Benmussa, who also directed the much talked about Portrait de Dora (1976), Hélène Cixous' feminist reply to Freud's analysis of one of his hysterical patients. The program to La Plage includes some remarks by Sarduy which prove to be significant in relation to the rest of his work and to what at least one spokesman 1 Severo Sarduy, "Cronologia," in Severo Sarduy (Madrid: Editorial Fun- damentos, 1976), p. 11. 415</page><page sequence="2">416 ROMANCE NOTES of the popular Parisian press has to say about the Cubans play. The contrast brings up a series of pertinent questions concerning the role of literature in contemporary society, and more specifically the role of a Spanish American writer with heavy French connections and victim of what some may have called an unresolved Heredia complex. On the sheet attached to the program, Sarduy explains what La plage is supposed to be all about: "une suite de sequences, ou plutôt les transformations d'une seule séquence qui, par ces vari- ations se change en son contraire." Although he refers specifically to the play, Sarduy restates what for lack of a better term might be called a part of his aesthetic credo, when he writes that "la seule réalité réside dans la transformation perpétuelle du récit, son deve- nir, sa métamorphose constante." Not incidentally he in fact restates what seems to be the credo of a whole generation of French nov- elists, critics, philosophers, psychoanalysts, poets, or just simply writers, makers of texts. The transformations of La Plage , like those in Sarduy's novel Cobra , are above all verbal, and the "characters" who surface in those texts are not subject to a psychological principle that would endow them with an illusory anthropomorphic totality, but rather they are fragments, morsels one might say, subject to no logic except that imposed at each turn by the shifts of language which make up not "characters" but a single yet multivoiced textual "persona." "On ne peut parler de personnages," writes Sarduy in the program note, "puisque la psychologie et la constitution de la 'personnalité' dramatique sont soumises, comme les autres données de la pièce, au hasard des transformations ..." All of this may work in the writ- ten text of Cobra or in the audiotext of the original version of La Plage , but on the stage, with human actors, what one may call the non-representational "characterization" of a written or an oral text fails when the language of the work clashes with the inevitable corporeity of the actors, men and women whose proper names after all appear prominently on the program. This conflict between a non-representational text, "travail sur la mémoire qui se renouvelle et se transforme dans la poésie oniri- que," and the traditional idea of a stage peopled by human actors seems to be the hidden point on which hinges the judgment of at</page><page sequence="3">SARDUY'S LA PLAGE AND FRANCE-SOIR 417 least one reviewer of the play, François Chalais of France-Soir , March 12, 1977. His comments, in the name of a popular, bourgeois journal may be contrasted to the remarks about the play included in the program, a significant opposition of views for which this note might be the vehicle. François Chalais accurately describes the techniques, the passions of Sarduy before stating his general disap- pointment with the whole adventure. "Cubain fixé en France," Chalais writes, Sarduy "a la passion du vocabulaire. Les mots le mettent littéralement en transes. Il les aime tellement qu'il n'hésite pas à répéter à l'infini ceux qui lui plaisent." Then he adds, setting the tone of the review, "Evidemment c'est un peu monotone." Of the "characterization" in La Plage , Chalais writes, "Ne pouvant sans doute pas faire autrement, il a quand même été obligé d'inven- ter des personnages." The "characters" end up by becoming one person and the play: "Ce n'est plus une pièce. C'est un serpent qui se mord la queue." This allusion to Cobra is one of the most compli- mentary things France-Soir has to say about Sarduy. The reviewer recounts the events of the play, as if to point out their total lack of linear or causal coherence, events that are in fact but the skeleton on which rests the verbal spectacle of the play. Comparing the original radioplay with the present stage version, Chalais concludes, "Conçue d'abord pour la radio, son œuvre a cependant perdu l'avan- tage qu'elle offrait à l'origine; à savoir la possibilité qu'elle nous laissait de couper le son ou d'écouter une autre station." What makes the audiotext valuable, however, is not that we can turn it off at will, but that there, the space of exchange that is the text remains purely verbal, a programmed dialogue reconstituted at each hearing by each listener. As elsewhere in the texts of Sarduy, the theatrical metaphor works well in a non-visual text, the platitude (flatness) of writing taking a kind of symbolic volume that would engulf writer and reader in a quasi-erotic theatrical space. However, such a space of exchange must be removed from the idea of "per- sonality" associated with the traditional psychological view of a person as a unity and of the actor as the somatic vehicle for the "essence" of a given character. It is for this reason that in Cobra , Sarduy's creatures are told before appearing on scene, "Sean brech- tianas," and the "Teatro lírico de muñecas" at times seems composed of puppets ressembling the manipulated marionets of Japanese Bun-</page><page sequence="4">418 ROMANCE NOTES raku. Thus the representational fallacy, so to speak, associated with traditional characterization is undermined by these references to a theatre that is, as Roland Barthes has pointed out in L'Empire des signes , effectively non-representational: Brecht and the Bun- raku. 2 Yet on the stage in Paris it seems that the actors cannot avoid a certain representational malaise that becomes bothersome when dealing with a work such as Sarduy 's. When the fantasies, the verbal reveries of the writer appear not in the graphic tracings of the printed page or in the incorporeal sounds of the radio but instead through the somatic form of living actors, the whole thing may indeed become "un peu monotone." Such is the almost inescapable banality of having a head, two arms, two legs, and all the rest, so many props giving an illusion of unity that clashes with the verbal fragments of the text. There lies the "failure" of the play, not in its lack of coherence. At any rate, the experiment throws some light on the impasse on which contemporary literature continues to tread. It wants to escape "the book," wishes itself theatrical, but when it finally lands on the stage, it remains verbal, still literary, "poésie onirique" perhaps but not theatre. The author would add a kind of amatory volume to the linearity of the printed page, signalled particularly by theatrical/ erotic metaphors, but when he actually writes for the stage, he still has to maintain the obnoxious division of audience/ actors. As for Severo Sarduy himself, he is in that illustrious tradition of the American writer exiled in Paris, but in his case there seems to be no exile's return in sight. The space in which he works has long ago ceased to be geographic and remains purely verbal, Cuban Spanish by way of the boulevard St. Germain. His works echo beau- tifully the rvthms of Tel Quel and provide material for North Amer- ican professors to write more articles, or for popular French re- viewers to express their relative contempt for these "exercices qui ne font de mal à personne." 3 The writer seems to have made a virtue out of the necessity of writing for a kind of elite, churning out his words in the same parasitic circle long ago described by 2 (Geneva: Skira, 1970), p. 74. 3 François Chalais, "Blablabla-les-Bains," rev. of La Plage, by Severo Sarduy, France-Soir, 12 March 1977, p. 21.</page><page sequence="5">SARDUY'S LA PLAGE AND FRANCE-SOIR 419 Sartre, while the general public would rather turn the sound off or change stations. Yet the France-Soir reviewer pays Sarduy perhaps the ultimate compliment when he concludes that the di- rector "Simone Benmussa a signé d'un élégant paraphe cette page blanche/' What better accolade these days for any manifestation of contemporary literature than to serve as the empty pretext for an elegant frame? It has come to that with literature, and if Sarduy's work is removed from his native shores and its problems, and if in France his efforts "ne font de mal à personne," there is still in his work an affront that will not be so easily turned off as one does a radio. There is a destruction, a deconstruction, a movement from the inside of the decrepit edifice of literature whose consequences are yet to be fully appreciated, a movement a step of which is marked by this presentation at the "Petit Orsay."
