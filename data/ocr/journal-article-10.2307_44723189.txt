Manufacturers of both military and commercial aircraft are challenged to become Lean, Agile and Flexible. As progress is slowly made toward introducing advanced assembly systems into production, the overall cost of automation is now more closely scrutinized. After spending tens of millions of dollars on large automated systems with deep foundations, many manufacturers find themselves locked into high cost manufacturing systems that have specific, inflexible configurations. This kind of scenario has caused a shift in the attitude of airframe assemblers, to go back to basics. Lean manufacturing is seen as a way to build aircraft with very low investment in equipment and tools. Today's advanced systems developers do understand the need for more affordable assembly systems. One of the most promising solutions is seen as flexible adaptable robotic systems that utilize metrology, robotics and simulation sub systems, all integrated into an intelligent assembly cell. This presentation will address this type of intelligent, robotic automation for assembly of aircraft components. INTRODUCTION Aircraft assembly has always been considered a highly labor intensive operation. The increasingly large size and lack of stiffness in the structural elements of the airframe as they move closer to final assembly, makes attempts to achieve dimensional repeatability and predictability very difficult. Attempts to automate these assembly steps have focused toward very large and rigid support structures that fit inside the working envelope of even larger, very rigid numerically controlled machine tools where drilling and fastener installation tasks are performed. These extremely large and expensive systems have proven themselves to be successful in high volume production environments, however attempts to apply similar automated concepts in aircraft programs with much lower volume production rates have not shown the same results. In many other industries where labor intensive assembly tasks existed, such as automotive, appliance, bottling etc. robotic arms have been found to be a suitable solution in highly repetitive task situations, attempts to apply robotic arms to aircraft assembly has not been as successful. The initial consideration for use of a robotic arm, show benefits of: huge work envelope; great versatility; low cost hardware. Everything is relative. The terms 'huge', 'great' and 'low cost', are used when comparing robot equipment to conventional machine tools. A large anthropomorphic robot may have the work envelope of an average sized living room, have a multitude of end-effectors, six degrees of freedom, all for a price of around $100k. Unfortunately, robotic arms have their shortcomings too (again compared to machine tools). Those shortcomings are: less accurate; less rigid; less programming support from CAD/CAM systems. This paper will define the limitations of conventional robotic arms in the above mentioned areas. We will also describe the approach taken by a consortium of small high technology companies who teamed with Boeing to develop an advanced robotics system with the portability, rigidity, accuracy and intelligence, to meet the needs of aircraft assembly applications. MAIN SECTION ACCURACY - When determining accuracy of robotic arms, we must separate the term accuracy into two categories, Repeatability and Positional. In comparison to machine tools, a conventional anthropomorphic robotic arm is not considered very 815</page><page sequence="2">accurate in either category. Most robotics manufacturers do not even mention positional accuracy when performance is specified. This is not an attempt to cover up some weakness; it is simply not considered a very interesting factor in most robotic applications. This is partly due to the way robotic arms are traditionally programmed, namely by 'teach-in'. The teach-in method has the advantage that the sum of all errors are zero. If the arm is repeatable and the work-piece is placed in the same location in front of the robot, the end-effector will be able to perform its task in the right place every time, despite the fact that the location for this task is more or less 'unknown'. For aircraft assembly applications, this 'teach-in' method of programming cannot apply due to the different requirements such as: • much lower production rates than automotive • limited floor space requires maximizing the use of all assets on more than one application • parts are larger than the work envelope of the robot • parts are not precisely formed and difficult to fit to CAD data • programming data is supplied from CAD with dimensions in a Cartesian coordinate system • distance from fastener hole to edge of part is critical, as minimum metal is used to reduce weight in the structure. For these type requirements, positional accuracy becomes most important. Fig 1 Anthropomorphic Robotic Arm SOURCES OF ERRORS IN POSITIONAL ACCURACY - Positional accuracy was never considered important in the first place, due to the way that robots are normally used and so not much has been done to eliminate the errors in this area. The total error is composed of several types of error: • Kinematic errors due to discrepancy between the kinematic model of the arm in the controller. In other words, the parts of the robot are not manufactured with tolerances small enough to be negligible. Or one may view it like this: The kinematic model does not have any entries for discrepancy between the nominal and the actual values of the machine elements that makes up the arm. • Elastic deformation of the machine elements under the influence of their own weight (constant) and the weight of the end-effector and the payload (variable). The manufacturer tries to minimize weight and volume of the arms since this is important in automotive transfer line applications, where many robots have to share a limited floor space. Sleek design also makes the arms faster. High acceleration is the key to short cycle times in many applications like welding, assembly and pick 'n' place. • Calibration errors. Robots are usually calibrated with instruments of low resolution. • Repeatability errors. A robot cannot achieve positional accuracy without first having acceptable repeatability. SOURCES OF ERRORS IN STIFFNESS - The basic design of conventional, or anthropomorphic, robots have rotational axis positioned in series at fixed lengths between the base and the wrist. This configuration allows a small structure to cover a large area with great flexibility. This configuration also develops repeatability and stiffness problems as errors in the rotational axis are compounded as the distance between the base and the wrist increases. LIMITED CAD/CAM SUPPORT - Machine tools are designed to travel in a Cartesian coordinate system; their paths are predictable and highly repeatable. Robots have six or more axis, which are not positioned along a Cartesian coordinate system. Their paths between points are not always predictable or repeatable. As their accuracy was never considered acceptable to use only CAD/CAM data, CAD/CAM software suppliers never found a large enough market to warrant software development. ROBOTIC SYSTEM DEVELOPMENTS - A portable, flexible, robotic system called TI2 was concepted by a consortium on small companies who teamed with Boeing Phantom Works to develop this into an intelligent system capable of meeting the needs of aerospace assembly. To meet those needs, improvements in Stiffness; Repeatability; Positional Accuracy; Portability and Orientation to CAD data, would be needed when compared to conventional robotic systems. IMPROVEMENTS IN STIFFNESS &amp; REPEATABILITY - Unlike many other problems, rigidity cannot be improved by software (at least not yet). The TI2 system uses a parallel robotic arm for maximum rigidity. Unlike the conventional or anthropomorphic robots that have their joints aligned in series from base to end-effector, a parallel arm robot may have the end-effector supported by more than one joint, each joint attached to the same foundation. For instance, a hexapod is six joints 816</page><page sequence="3">supporting the end-effector, giving it six degrees of freedom. The parallel arm in the TI2 system is a tripod that supports a spherical wrist, totaling six degrees of freedom. Today, the only controllers that support six degrees of freedom are robotic controllers, thus defining the parallel arm as a robotic arm. Fig 2 Parallel Kinematic Robot Now, if parallel arms are such a virtue, why are not all robots parallel instead of serial? First of all, the kinematic equations are much more complicated in a parallel machine than in a serial. The inverse (or backward) kinematics (from Cartesian to joint space) does not have any standard solutions like the Denavit-Hartenberg solution, but instead they depend on the type of machine elements that are used in each particular parallel machine. In the worst case, one might have to perform the calculations in two steps, where the first step has a small error that is a function of the result of the first solution. Once the solution is known, the error can be calculated and a correction applied. Even worse is the fact that there is no solution to the direct (or forward) kinematics (from joint to Cartesian space). The only way to find a solution to the direct kinematics is to iterate using the inverse kinematics equations. This is an extremely time consuming task and cannot be fitted into the 20 ms control loop of the controller. Fortunately this is not necessary to make the arm follow a linear trajectory. The direct solution is only necessary at discrete occasions, like at emergency stops, search stop, start up of the system etc. In general, it can be said that a parallel arm is at least 3-4 times less compliant than an anthropomorphic arm. The potential for accuracy is greatly improved since the error of the Tool Center Point (TCP) is not a function of the sum of angular errors of the individual joints. Instead, the error of the TCP is an 'average' of the errors in lengths of the legs in the tripod/hexapod. In the case of a tripod, the error of the wrist is superimposed to the error of the TCP. In a spherical wrist however, it is relatively easy to mechanically align the axis so that the error is insignificant. IMPROVEMENTS IN POSITIONAL ACCURACY - One approach to improve accuracy is to use some kind of sensor feedback from the arm to the controller. This is the approach used by the TI2 system. A photogrammetric system is used as the sensor. The photogrammetric system, referred to as the PCS, Positioning Camera System, is somewhat similar to a conventional vision system. That is, cameras are used to find features in the field of view. An important difference is that the PCS can locate the targets in 3D space by triangulation while conventional vision systems are (with a few exceptions) 2D. A conventional vision system is looking for contrasts in the image and uses these contrasts to determine the location of certain features. The disadvantage of this method is that varying light quality on the surface, makes it hard (sometimes impossible) to find the edges that the system was programmed to find. The PCS uses reflective targets and non-structured light from a flash to have the same conditions every time a picture is taken. This makes the system robust in a "noisy light" production environment. During development of the TI2 system, it was determined that taking one set of pictures of the end-effector with the part to be machined in the background, was sufficient to perform part recognition and an approximate solution to the orientation of part to robot. This orientation, done by the PCS, transforms the part into the robot's coordinate system via the end-effector's coordinate system. However, the strength of only one measurement is not sufficiently accurate to position the part for machining. Even a small error in the orientation of the end-effector would result in a larger error as the robot arm is moved to the limits of it's reach. This is simply due to the nature of equal sided triangles. To overcome this, several (&gt;3) sets of pictures are taken. The robot arm moves the end- effector to a known place in the robot coordinate system and a picture is taken, this is done in four different locations. From each set of pictures, the position (but not the orientation) of the end-effector in the part coordinate system is stored. These positions of the end effector, will then define a plane that gives the orientation of the robot and the part. The bigger the 'footprint', the better the accuracy. 817</page><page sequence="4">Fig 3 Tl2 with Reflective Photogrammetry Targets However, if the footprint becomes too big, there may be a small positioning error caused by the arm within the big footprint. This is avoided by taking smaller 'footprints' in different areas within the robot work envelope. This also has the advantage of resolving errors that are not linear over the entire work envelope. This happens to be the case with all of the errors mentioned above. IMPROVEMENTS IN PORTABILITY &amp; ORIENTATION - The TI2 robotic system was placed upon a mobile platform that would allow the machine to be moved to the part or the part to be moved to the machine. This capability allows the robotic system to move around parts that are much bigger than the work envelope of the robot. By using the photogrammetric Positioning Camera System (PCS), the TI2 is able to orient itself against small sections of very large parts and performing machining tasks. The PCS system uses coded reflective targets to identify both the part and the end effector attached to the robotic arm. By recognizing these coded targets and their location in 3D space, the PCS can compute the orientation of robotic arm to small sections of a very large part. This method of very fast, non-contact, robot to part orientation, gives the robotic system a virtually unlimited work envelope as long as all reflective targets have been assigned values in the same coordinate system. The third component of the TI2 system is the MCU or Master Control Unit. The MCU uses Unix workstation running robotic and assembly simulation software. New software modules were developed and added to support communication with the PCS and the robotic controller. The MCU acts as the operator interface. With simplified controls and graphical displays of the virtual workcell, the operator can check to see if the virtual part selected by the system matches the actual part loaded in the workcell. The virtual orientation of the robot to part that is displayed on the monitor, is adjusted to match the actual orientation determined by the PCS. The MCU software performs a simulation to determine if there are any collisions and if all parts of the program can be performed. The simulation also creates the robotic program in the correct language of the robot's controller. If the simulation is acceptable, the program is downloaded to the robot controller and the robot is put to work. CONCLUSION By developing a system that has improved stiffness, repeatability and accuracy over conventional robots, we can meet the demanding needs of aerospace assembly at a much lower cost than conventional automation approaches. By adding an operator interface that performs part program and end effector selection as well as automatic set up, we hope to have a successful transition into production in the near future.
