<plain_text><page sequence="1">Debra Hershkowitz Sexuality and Madness in Statius9 Thebaid The Thebaid begins with Oedipus summoning Tisiphone to cause discord between his impious sons. Immediately ascend- ing from the underworld, the Fury imbues Polynices and Eteo- cles subtly but powerfully with madness. As this madness grows and spreads, so does thè scope and action of the poem: thè fraternal discord escalates into full-scale war as the conflict- causing (and conflict-caused) madness, once a family affair, draws an ever-increasing number of participants and an ever- widening landscape into the mass disruptions and destruction it produces, engulfing armies and cities and entangling heaven and underworld. In this way madness is fundamental to the Thebaid, exerting a powerful influence over the narrative - and meta-narrative - activity of the poem. Due to the ubiquitous quality of madness, a wide variety of avenues présent them- selves for the exploration of how madness is manifested and how it opérâtes in the poem. One of the paths into such an exploration is blazed by Statius' choice of subject matter, the Oedipodae confusa domus (1, 17), the familial confusion of the Theban house resulting from sexual perversity, compounded by and rooted in furor. Sex is the fundamental thème in any account of Oedipus and his offspring, and it is to the rela- tionship between Theban sexuality and madness that this paper will explore. Soon after his marriage in Argos, Polynices' thoughts turn back to Thebes. Remembering the day of his expulsion at the hands of his brother and brooding over his lost status, Poly- nices longs to return to his homeland: Much of the research for this paper was carried out while I had a Fulbright Grant at the University of Bristol. An earlier version of this paper was presented to the Postgraduate Literature Seminar at Bristol in November, 1992. I am grateful to Denis Feeney and to the two anonymous référées of «MD» for their helpful sugges- tions and criticism; needless to say, any remaining errors (of judgement or other- wise) are my own.</page><page sequence="2">124 Debra Hershkowitz ueluti dux taurus amata ualle carens, pulsum solito quem gramine uictor iussit ab erepta longe mugire iuuenca, cum profugo placuere tori ceruixque recepto sanguine magna redit fractaeque in pectora quercus, bella cupit pastusque et capta armenta reposcit iam pede, iam cornu melior - pauet ipse reuersum uictor, et attoniti uix agnouere magistri - : non alias tacita iuuenis Teumesius iras mente acuit. (2, 323-31) In this simile, thè Theban exile is comparée! to a bull who has been ousted from his herd by a rival. Motivated by a desire to return to the herd and to regain his status of dux, the bull gathers up his strength physically, much as Polynices works himself up mentally. But while the exiled bull of thè simile does return to the herd and confront his now fearful rival, the exiled Polynices can only imagine such a violent confrontation be- tween himself and his rival, since, at this point, he is in a dis- advantaged position legally (Eteocles has not yet ruled even for his allotted year) and militarily (Polynices, unlike his brother, has no army at his disposai). The current impossibility of the fulfilment of Polynices' desires is reinforced in the subséquent scènes, in which he must deny that he has any such desires to soothe the anxiety of his perceptive wife, and in which he agrées to a non-violent course of action, the sending of an embassy to Eteocles. Unlike the bull, Polynices must suppress his desire for confrontation and revenge. The images of a defeated bull gaining strength in exile and of two bulls fighting for supremacy over a herd are traditional in descriptions of epic combat. One paradigmatic example which thè simile in the Thebaid recalls occurs in the last book of the Aeneid. There, as the confrontation between Aeneas and Tur- nus grò ws imminent, Turnus is compared to a bull: his agitur furiis, totoque ardentis ab ore scintillae absistunt, oculis micat acribus ignis, mugitus ueluti cum prima in proelia taurus terrificos ciet aut irasci in cornua temptat arboris obnixus trunco, uentosque lacessit ictibus aut sparsa ad pugnam proludit harena. (Aen. 12, 101-6)</page><page sequence="3">Sexuality and Madness in Statius* Thebaid 125 This simile looks to a passage in the Georgics (3, 215-41) which illustrâtes thè power of sexual drives by a description of a bull, presented in anthropomorphic, epic language1. In that passage, a bull, ousted from his herd by a rival, gathers his strength, motivated by the pain of his unavenged wounds and pride and by unrequited sexual desire (gemens...quos amisit inultus amoreSy 226-7) to return to the herd and to challenge his rival; this is reflected in a powerful, powerfully sexual simile of the swelling and breaking of a massive wave. Vergil then goes on to make a généralisation: omne adeo genus in terris hominumque ferarumque et genus aequoreum, pecudes pictaeque uolucres, in furias ignemque ruunt: amor omnibus idem. (Geo. 3, 242-4) Bulls are the example of sexual potency par excellence, but ail animais are subject to the madness of sex and the violence it prompts (in furias ignemque ruunt), including man2. Just as bulls behave like epic combatants, so epic combatants behave like bulls. The description of Turnus, arming himself for his battle with Aeneas, as agitur furiis refers not only to the mad- ness of battlelust instilled within him by thè power of the Furies, but also to the madness of sexual passion . Directly be- fore the arming scene, Turnus saw Lavinia blush at the mention of Aeneas' name, a blush which, whatever its connotations are for Lavinia's state of mind, sets off an erotic spark in Turnus: illum turbat amor figitque in uirgine uultus; I ardet in arma magis... (Aen. 12, 70-1). As the heifer causes the bull to bum, so Lavinia causes Turnus to burn, in this case for weapons, an outer bellicose manifestation of Turnus' inner erotic turmoil, and as desire for the heifer drives the bull to rebuild his strength and confront his rival, just so does Turnus' desire drive him to prepare to confront his sexual rival (emphasised by the exact 1 . For a detailed analysis of the heroic aspects of the passage see the notes of R. A. B. Mynors, Virgil's Georgics: a commentary, Oxford 1990. 2. The particular subjection of man to sexual passion is perhaps emphasised by the primary position of hominum on the generalised list. 3. R. O. A. M. Lyne, Further Voices in VergiVs Aeneid, Oxford 1987, p. 69, suggests that Allecto «works with» Turnus* frustrated passion for Lavinia when she casts a torch - symbolic of both warf are and marriage - into his ehest; following this reading, the madness bestowed by the Fury is erotic madness to begin with.</page><page sequence="4">126 Debra Hershkowitz répétition of Geo. 3, 233-4 at Aen. 12, 105-6). When that con- frontation finally takes place, it too is likened to the battle of rival bulls (Aen. 12, 715-22): the raging heroes fight for sup- remacy over Latium as bulls fight for supremacy over a herd; more fundamentally, the bulls' struggle is for possession of the heifers of thè herd and thè power which that possession pro- vides (mussantque iuuencae I quis nemori imperitet, quem tota armento, sequantur), and similarly, Aeneas and Turnus' struggle is in some fundamental way for sexual possession of Lavinia, the symbol of and key to the control over Latium. Like Turnus at the beginning of Aeneid 12, Polynices in The- baid 2 is in a state of inner turmoil. Constantly brooding over his deprived status of exile, Polynices' Fury-instilled madness (dolor iraque démens , 2, 319) drives him to prepare for battle. In thè simile, the banished bull corresponding to Polynices is amata ualle carens: as the bull desires to return to his beloved homeland, so Polynices desires to return to Thebes. But the bull's motivation to return to his valley, his herd, and his for- mer status is sexually grounded: the bull's victorious rival has forced him ab erepta longe mugir e iuuenca. Just as the sexual provocation of Turnus is reinforced by the georgic image of the bull, so this bull simile illustrâtes the ambivalent combination of politicai and sexual desire operating within Polynices. Thebes, like the bull's valley, is the central focus of the exile's love, but at the same time, as thè simile indicates, it is not simp- ly an overpowering patriotic drive which prompts Polynices to act but, on some level, an erotic one. Thebes is figured as the location - and the object - not only of a politicai conflict but also of a sexual conflict, in which Eteocles is figured both as Polynices' politicai and sexual rival. Nor is this type of ambivalent imagery confined to Poly- nices. In a simile at 11, 251-6, Eteocles, preparing to meet Poly- nices on the battlefield, is likened to a bull eagerly anticipating the imminent return of a defeated rival and the ensuing rematch4. As in thè simile in book 2, to which this simile is a 4. This bull simile, appearing fairly late in the poem, resounds with the many other bull similes in the Thebaid, most importantly in this context thè simile at 3, 330-5, in which Tydeus, having defeated his 50 ambush attackers, temporarily usurps Polynices' projected (from thè simile in book 2) rôle of victorious bull (among the many characteristics expected of Polynices which Tydeus instead ex-</page><page sequence="5">Sexuality and Madness in Statius* Thebaid 127 counterpart, the inhérent sexual charge in thè politicai rivalry over the Theban house is emphasised. Moreover, thè first simile of the poem présents a programmatic image of the freshly mad- dened brothers as bulls in conflict. Not only is the use of bulls suggestive of the heightened importance of sexuality in the con- flict between Polynices and Eteocles (by pointing back to the dual bull similes of the Aeneid, and forward to the many sex- ually-charged bull similes of the Thebaid), but the atypical con- flict of the bulls in thè simile illustrâtes yet another aspect of the antagonism between Polynices and Eteocles5: sic ubi delectos per toma armenta iuuencos agricola imposito sociare adfectat aratro, Uli indignantes, quis nondum uomere multo ardua nodosos ceruix descendit in armos, in diuersa trahunt atque aequis uincula laxant uiribus et uario confundunt limite sulcos. (1, 131-6) Unlike thè usuai contest in which rival bulls meet, hère two yoked bulls struggle to separate. Similarly, Polynices and Eteo- cles are yoked together by their sibling relationship and by the equal madness which has infected them. Throughout the poem, as their sibling rivalry, fuelled by madness, escalates into full- scale war, they struggle with the impossible task of separating from the family bonds which link them together, a task which the brothers cannot even accomplish in death6. hibits); see also 4, 69-73, 4, 397-404, 6, 864-7, 7, 436-40 , 9, 82-5, and 12, 601-5 (to which I shall return below). 5. The Homeric antécédent to this passage (cited by H. Juhnke, Homerisches in römischer Epik flavischer Zeit, Munich 1972) is a picture of harmony rather than discord, the simile at Iliad 13, 703-8, in which the Aiantes stand and fight together like two yoked bulls working together to plow a straight line. 6. Before they are driven mad, the only information given about the relationship of Polynices and Eteocles is that they are united in the hatred of their father, according to Oedipus (insultant tenebris gemitusque odere paternos, 1, 78). After the brothers are driven mad, their madness-inspired treaty of revolving rule be- comes the only manifestation of fraternal piety (haec interpietas erat&gt; 1, 142), and its disastrous failure - producing the main action of the poem - is a constant mani- festation of the fraternal tension. Only when they are about to face each other in single combat is the strength and veracity of their sibling bond acknowledged, with Polynices declaring ο mihi nunc primum longo post tempore frater (11, 394): the brothers are united in madness and will soon be united in a single double death, which, far from finally imposing an end on their struggle for séparation, locks them</page><page sequence="6">128 Debra Hershkowitz Heredity is a miasmic force in thè Thebaid. As the poem opens, Oedipus is füll of madness: scelerumque inpectore Dirae (1, 52). He déclares in his programmane prayer that his life has been shaped by the repeated intervention of Tisiphone, who saved him from death as an infant and guided him ultimately to Thebes. He continues: ...dulcis furias et lamentabile matris conubium gauisus ini noctemque nefandam saepe tuli natosque tibi, scis ipsa, paraui... (1, 68-70) The dulcis furias were revealed to Oedipus to be not simply the madness of passionate desire but the madness of the Furies, even the Furies themselves7, showing thè intimate and inextric- able relationship between Oedipus' madness and his sexual ex- périence, or more specifically, his sexual perversion. Oedipus retrospectively recognises that he begot his sons because of Tisiphone - who brought him safely to his day of incestuous marriage8 - and for Tisiphone, so that through his sons she could bring further disaster to the Theban house. Because of this faithful, albeit unwitting, service to the Furies, Oedipus now claims himself to be the worthy récipient of Tisiphone's infernal aid against his sons; by requesting such aid, Oedipus continues his unwitting service to the Furies, fostering the spread of the madness which has already engulfed him to his progeny and beyond. forever, separate but inséparable, in unending fraternal conflict, impressively sig- nalled by the double flame of their single pyre (12, 429 ss.). 7. Οχ. Lai. Dict. s.v. «furia» 1 and 2. The word is used with various, blurring meanings throughout the poem: e.g. at 7, 562 Tydeus fires up the Argives after Iocasta's intervention so that arma herum furiae placent, implying not just baule madness but also the madness of the Furies, who immediately intervene (fera tem- pus Erinys I arripit... 562-3); or at 11, 1-2 where things settle down postquam mag- nanimus furias uirtutis iniquae I consumpsit Capaneus (Capaneus, the contemptor of ali things diuum, repeatedly defines his fury as coming from within himself (e.g. at 10, 485-6), but a Fury, at 11, 89-91, says otherwise). The blurring of sex and fury in dulcis furias may look to the similarity between the fury of the Furies and of Venus in Vergil and more explicitly in Valerius Flaccus, for which see P. Hardie, Flavian Epicists on Virgil's Epie Technique, «Ram us» 18, 1989, pp. 5-9, building on Lyne (op. cit. n. 3) 13 ss. 8. As she will later deliver his sons safely to their day of death: the Fury prevents Polynices' premature death at 6, 513-17 and saves Eteocles at 8, 686-7.</page><page sequence="7">Sexuality and Madness in Statius* Tbebaid 129 In the catalogue of the seven Argive heroes and their armies marching off towards Thebes, the description of Polynices con- cludes: iam regnum matrisque sinus fidasque sorores spe uotisque tenet, tarnen et de turre suprema attonitam totoque extantem corpore longe respicit Argian; haec mentem oculosque reducit coniugis et dulcis auertit pectore Thebas. (4, 88-92) Polynices' desire to return to his hereditary kingdom is linked with his desire to regain the sinus matris, displaying his eaually- hereditary sexual yearning for a return to the womb - in Thebes, the family motto is not merely «like father, like son» but «like son, like son». This perverted sexual drive is set in tense apposition first with Polynices' fidas sorores (whose vir- ginity will be discussed below) and then, strikingly, with his lawfully-wedded, non-Theban wife, his partner in a socially - and divinely - sanctioned sexual union. His hésitation in leav- ing Argia and journeying to dulcis Thebas recalls, with a twist, Aeneas' difficult position in Carthage: admonished and terri- fied by Mercury, Aeneas burns to leave Dido - ardet abirefuga dulcisque relinquere terras (Aen. 4, 281) - but not without more than a tinge of regret: as Austin judiciously remarks, «fuga shows that Aeneas had to 'run away' from the desires of the flesh»10. In contrast, Polynices is running towards the desires of the flesh, and not even the appearance of his désirable wife is able to cause him to stop11. More importantly, dulàs Thebas resounds with - and is essentially synonymous with - the inces- tuous dulàs furias of Oedipus: Polynices' journey to Thebes is 9. For sinus as «womb» or «vagina» see J.

Unlike the young Oedipus, in whose lingering footsteps Polynices, bear- ing the ill-fated image of the Sphinx (4, 87), treads, Polynices makes his return to Thebes with his eyes open, yet in his mad- ness he is as blind as his father14. Oedipus, having recognised his Theban wife as his mother and himself as a Theban, has, through his removal of his eyes, permanently averted both Thebes and his mother from his sight15, and now has a ehest füll of madness; the sight of Argia temporarily shakes the madness of Thebes from Polynices' ehest, causing him to avert his eyes and mind, for a moment, to his Argive wife from his Theban mother. And what of the Theban mother? Oedipus' incestuous acts may hâve started the current spate of familial Theban madness, but only via the fertile womb of Iocasta, who is stili alive and well-meaning in the Thebaid. Iocasta first appears in the poem when she makes a failed attempt to prevent the war as Poly- nices' Argive allies camp outside Thebes. Approaching the Ar- gives, she calls herself thè impia belli I mater (7, 483-4) and déclares that in his aliquod ins exsecrabile castris I huic utero est (484-5)16.

Perhaps he is not so much blind as looking thè wrong way, itself a father- echoing gesture. Marching on Thebes, Polynices looks back at Argos: so Oedipus, tilting his sightless gaze up to the heavens directs his prayer down to the under- world (1, 54ff.). Also, the young Oedipus, first venturing into Thebes, was looking for a new homeland but looking in the wrong place, namely his true homeland. 15.

Her res- igned a dolori contrasts sharply with Oedipus' indignant pro dolori (1, 77) when he complains of his sons' maltreatment of him and calls upon Tisiphone to destroy them. By doing this Oedipus actively compounds the madness which Iocasta can only passively accept and endure, just as her womb more than once passively received and nourished the seeds of that madness17. Because of her passivity and résignation, she is an even more unwitting agent of the Furies than Oedipus. Begging Polynices to return with her to Thebes to negotiate with Eteo- cles, she asks anne times, ne forte doli, et te conscia mater I decipiam? (511-12), but where Iocasta is concerned, it is never a question of active, conscious déception, but rather a blameless, passive form of déception. Iocasta deceived the son of her first marriage and was herseif deceived by seeing herself only as a politico-sexual reward and not as a mother, and now deceives the son of her second marriage and is herself deceived by seeing herself only as a mother and not as a politico-sexual reward. Iocasta beseeches Polynices as a mother (genetrix iubeoque rogoque, 506), but it is not only filial piety which tempts the son to accept his mother's proposai (ipse etiam ante oculos nunc matris ad oscula uersus, 534). Nor was his initial response to her, when she arrived, without a hint of sexual violation (rap- tam Ucrimis gaudentibus inplet I so Ut ur que tenens, 493-4) . Iocasta displays more of an awareness of her double rôle based on the singular importance of her womb later on when, accost- ing Eteocles in a final, frenzied attempt to stop the now un- stoppable duel, she asks pointedly quo deinde redibit I uictor? in hosne sinus? (11, 332-3). Moreover, she déclares haec tibi canines, haec sunt calcanda, nefande, I ubera, perque uterum sonipes hic matris agendus (341-2): before Eteocles attacks his brother he must attack his mother by treading on her womb, 17. Following the deaths of Polynices and Eteocles, Iocasta no longer passively accepts the perversity and madness surrounding her life, preparing to kill herself diro questa cubili I et natifuriis et primi coniugis umbris... (11, 637-8). Even so, her suicide, while being the only remaining action available to her, is a passive (réac- tion. 18.

By such violent acts against thè violated body parts of their parents, thè brothers enact a répétition of thè original violation. And it is precisely this Theban drive to repeat violation and destruction which causes Iocasta's failure to hold Polynices and Eteocles back from battle; both sons, striving - like Iocasta's husband/son had before them, and like her other husband had before him - to gain sole power over their motherland, leave thè empowering embrace of their mother19. It is worth noting that when Iocasta first enters thè action of thè Thebaid, she is described with regard to her haggard physical appearance, Eumenidum uelut antiquissima (7, 477). The simile is extraordinary, and most appropriate: thè woman who was thè object of and was responsible for Oedipus' dulcis furias has metamorphosed imo something of a Furia herself. Iocasta's resemblance to a Fury increases during her confronta- tion with Eteocles in book 11. Madly seeking her son, she is non sexus décousue memor (11, 318); like thè Furies, she is iemale but has ceased, in her madness, to be femmine, acting in a manner beyond thè prescribed limits of proper iemale behaviour20. Identifying Eteocles' madness as a répétition of past Fury-sent madness (quisfuror? unde iterum regni integra- ta resurgit I Eumenis? 329-30), Iocasta tries to counter thè in- fluence of thè Furies by acting like a Fury herself: stabo ipso in limine portae I auspicium infelix scelerumque inmanis imago 19. Iocasta ends her speech to Polynices: ...aut natum complexa superstite bello I hic moriar (7, 526-7), and ends her speech to Eteocles: tu limino, auita deosque I linquis et a nostris in fratrem amplexibus exisf (11, 352-3). 20. Simìlarly, thè raving Polyxo urges thè Lemnian women to pellite sexum (5, 102); thè murderous women, in thè sways of madness, are like Amazons, thè para- digmatic non-feminine females (144-6) (thè Amazons make a carneo appearance in thè Tbebaid; see below); later, battling thè Argonauta with thè weapons of and in thè armour of their dead husbands, when they see clearly their mighty opponente, rediit in pectora sexus (397). Also Argia, going mad after Polynices' death, non femineae subitum uirtutis amorem I cottigli Argia, sexuque immane relieto I tractat opus (12, 177-9). Gender in thè Tbebaid is an issue which merits examination, but I am unable to discuss it in depth here. Suffice it to say that thè kind of gender inversion illustrated in thèse examples, thè appropriation of non-feminine/mascu- line(?) qualities by mad females, enables thè women to act, and as such is an impor- tant factor in thè manifestation of madness.</page><page sequence="11">Sexuality and Madness in Statius* Thebaid 133 (339-40), recalling the threshold-sitting Furies of the Aeneid {Aen. 4, 473; cf. Aen. 12, 849). This (self-) figuring as a Fury undermines the value of her Statement that she, unlike Oedipus, has not called on the Furies to destroy her sons (344-5), for while she has not sought their aid, she cannot help but aid them. Her resemblance to the very thing she wishes to defeat calls attention to the fact that, although working toward the opposite end, she is a fundamental part of the means of her family's destruction. Iocasta functions as an ever-present Fury in the Theban house. Virginity stands at the opposite end of the spectrum f rom the sexual perversity of the house of Oedipus, and yet, ironically, it is the virginal daughters of Oedipus who in the Thebaid serve as paradigmatic figures of sexual purity. Nevertheless, virginity does not free Antigone and Ismene from their family's heredit- ary préoccupation with sexual perversity, nor does the purity of virginity prove an adequate défense against the sexually- charged force of madness. Antigone first appears in the Thebaid in the teichoscopia of book 7, where she is presented as an innocent maiden, pro- tected by an elderly guardian: turre procul sola nondum concessa uideri Antigone populis teneras defenditur atra ueste genas; iuxtaque cornes, quo Laius ibat armigero; tune uirgo senem regina ueretur. (7, 243-6) Antigone's sexual purity goes hand in hand with the propriety of her behaviour21. Unlike her brothers who are disdainful in their treatment of their elderly father, Antigone shows révér- ence for this old man, respectfully addressing her guardian as pater (248). In response to her questions about the massing troops, the old man names the various Theban allies. At one point Antigone asks about a spécifie pair: 'illi autem, quanam iunguntur origine fratres? sic certe paria arma uiris, sic exit in auras cassidis aequus apex; utinam haec concordia nostris!' 21 . The maidenhood of Antigone hère may be further emphasised by its contrast with the wifehood (and, indeed, motherhood) of Argia similarly looking at the warriors de turre suprema at 4, 89-91 (discussed above).</page><page sequence="12">134 Debra Hershkowitz cui senior ridens: 'non prima errore uidendi falleris, Antigone: multi hos - nam decipit aetas - dixerunt fratres. pater est natusque...' (7, 291-6) Antigone is interested in thè origins of thè brothers whom she sees on thè battlefield, lamenting that her own brothers (pro- duced from a perverted and ill-fated origó) do not display such fraternal harmony. But, as thè old man explains, she is deceived by appearances: Lapithaon was ravished by a nymph at a very young age and therefore is in his prime at thè same time as his son, Alatreus. The outcome of thè sexual violation of thè young boy by thè nymph, then, is a harmonious relationship between a father and a son who look and act like brothers, while, in contrast, thè outcome of thè sexual violation (which could only be recognised as violation in retrospect) of Iocasta by Oedipus is an inharmonious relationship between a father and sons who are ali brothers. Lapithaon and Alatreus nunc sic fratres mentito nomine gaudent, I plus pater (303-4), as opposed to Polynices and Eteocles, real brothers whose unfraternal hatred of each other is only matched by their brother/father's hatred of them22. The mistake of thinking that thè father and son are brothers is a common one, a happy error and a source of pride for both father and son, but nevertheless Antigone's inability to distinguish their true familial relationship, due to thè con- founding processes of sexual violation, is uncannily in accord- ance with her own family's inbred and rather more profound inability to make such distinctions: her mistake in not seeing Lapithaon and Alatreus for what they really are resounds with Iocasta's and Oedipus' mistake in not seeing each other for what they really were. Ismene, with Antigone, accompanies locusta on her visit to Polynices, but whereas Antigone will play an increasingly im- portant rôle in thè rest of thè poem, thè only extended portrait 22. Lapithaon and Alatreus are not thè Thebaid's only pair of harmonious brother figures who correspond contrastingly to Polynices and Eteocles: see, e.g., thè Thespiadae (2, 629 ss.) and thè sons of Hypsipyle, Thoas and Euneos (5, 710 ss.; 6, 340 ss.). The poem abounds in discordant sets of siblings. For discussions of such doubles see Zeitlin (op. cit. η. 13) pp. 139-41, D. C.

(8, 554-62) Rather than concentrating on the misdeeds of her family, Atys concentrâtes on the misfortunes of Ismene (caused by the mis- deeds of her family), and in doing so turns his beloved's short- comings into attractions: for Atys, Ismene's poor yet pure liv- ing conditions reflect and reinforce the image of her own sexual purity, and the grief Ismene endures becomes not a shared sor- row for her lover but another source of desirability, since, by being undeserved, it increases the alluring image of Ismene's goodness, already set in apposition to the depravity of her cir- cumstances. Atys' participation in the war, then, is prompted by desire rather than politics, and as such recalls the involve- ment of Coroebus in the Trojan War in Aeneid 2 because of his love for Cassandra. Coroebus fights recklessly and loses his life (while causing many other lives to be lost) through his reckless- ness when he tries unsuccessfully to rescue his captured be- loved; similarly, Atys fights recklessly and loses his life, but his death is not, like Coroebus', incurred through ill-fated heroics, but through inexpérience and immaturity. Perhaps Atys is especially responsive to the attraction of Ismene's virginity since he is a virgin himself, a youth just reaching manhood (tnplia ueUuerat ostro I surgentes etiam- num umeros et leuia mater I pectora, 564-6) and taking part in warfare for the first (and last) time. He grows over-confident by his success in fighting against weak enemies and soon un- wisely turns his attention to Tydeus, currently in the course of his aristeia. Atys' ephebic, effeminate state contrasts starkly with that of his mature, masculine Opponent23, as the two juxta- 23. For the reader, that is, who has repeatedly witnessed Tydeus' prowess in com-</page><page sequence="14">136 Debra Hershkowitz posed similes of the épisode illustrate: in thè first Atys is com- pared to a young lion, inexperienced in slaughter {sanguinis in- sonsy 574), attacking unwatched flocks and being easily satisfied by gouging itself on a lamb (572-6), while in the second Tydeus is compared to a powerful lion who, mad with bloodlust (mag- no furor est in sanguine mergiy 595), passes up calves and heifers (corresponding to Atys) to attack a bull (593-6). Prematurely playing the roles of warrior and of husband (Menoeceus will describe him as an unsuccessful coniugis ultor, 603), Atys proves no match for Tydeus, an experienced warrior and hus- band. Tydeus stresses this in his vaunt over Atys, claiming that the spoils he could take from Atys - thè grand clothing and weapons Atys' mother provided him so that he would be worthy of his royal betrothed - would not be worthy of his wife Deipyle (588-91). Just as Atys' lack of combat expérience makes him unable to counter the mad force of Tydeus' battle rampage, so his lack of sexual expérience makes him unable to counter Tydeus' madness-enhanced virility. Atys' death is sex- ualised, figured as an act of sexual perversion: Tydeus offhandedly flings an unwarlike dart (imbelle... iaculumy 584-5) at Atys, but it enters Atys as if sent with all of Tydeus' strength (ceu totis intortum uiribusy 586), going deep into his groin24. In one stroke, perverted défloration and destruction are delivered to the youth, the topos of virgin death in war25. bat; Atys, without any knowledge of warf are and judges Tydeus only by his slight appearance (577-8) and is fatally deceived. 24.

Whitby, P. Hardie, and M. Whitby (edd.), Homo Viator: Classical Essays for John Bramble, Bristol 1987, pp. 185-98. One would expect to find an archetypal example of perverted défloration in Parthenopaeus, the Thebaid's most important virgin warrior-youth, himself the product of a violation of virginity (Atalanta's rape (9, 612-16)) and relying on the virgin goddess Diana for protection and success. While his pathetic death at thè end of book 9 does result from his inexpérience of real warfare and from his exclusion from manhood due to his virginity (which makes it impossible for him to match the virile strength and madness of his final Opponent Dry as (9, 841 ss.) when his divine patroness finally forsakes him), nevertheless Parthenopaeus' death is not figured as a sexual perversion, but radier serves to isolate him permanently from sexuality by preventing his entrance into manhood: see Hardie (op. cit. η. 7) pp. 9-14, and P.

(8, 607-13) The sisters display their family's obsessive propensity to repeat its past by repeating its past in their discussion of the présent, returning to the incestuous origins of their current ills. Soon, however, Ismene voices new worries about the présent, telling Antigone of her dream the previous night: ecce ego, quae thalamos nec si pax alta maneret, tractarem sensu - pudet heu! -, conubia uidi nocte, soror; sponsum unde mihi sopor attulit amens uix notum uisu? semel his in sedibus illum, dum mea nescio quo spondentur foedera pacto, respexi non sponte, soror. turbata repente omnia cernebam, subitusque intercidit ignis, meque sequebatur rabido clamore reposcens mater Atyn. quaenam haec dubiae praesagia cladis? nec timeo, dum tuta domus milesque superstes Doricus et tumidos liceat conponere fratres. (8, 625-35) Ismene présents herself as passively subject to an arranged mar- riage with a prospective groom she has only seen once and even then unwillingly. She dénies having any desire for Atys, claim- ing that the very thought of marriage (and presumably the loss of virginity associated with marriage and particularly with the thalamos) is absent from her and shameful to her (pudet). Ismene's claims of disinterestedness, however, are undermined by the earlier description of the betrothal of Atys: necpectora uirginis Uli I diuersa (559-60). Moreover, while she states that her dream of Atys as husband was brought to her by sopor amens y by a sleepy, irrational state of mind contrary to her usuai, rational one, she herself undermines this idea by the questions she asks before revealing her dream to Antigone:</page><page sequence="16">138 Debra Hershkowitz quisnam hic mortalibus error? quae decepta fides? curam inuigilare quieti claraque per somnos animi simulacra reuerti? (8, 622-4) Perhaps what she perceives as madness is actually not madness at ail, or rather, while being madness, nevertheless is the true state of her mind, revealed to her only when she is asleep and unable to repress it, unable, in the family tradition, to deceive herseif in matters of sex. Ismene's questions recali those asked by Ovid's Byblis after her incestuous dreams of her brother: quid mihi significant ergo mea uisa? quod autem I somnia pon- dus habent? an habent et somnia pondus? {Met. 9, 495-6)26. Ismene only becomes aware of her repressed desire for Atys through her dream, and even then cannot openly accept it and calls it madness; Byblis also expériences her repressed desire for Caunus only in her dreams, but it is desire of which she is aware constantly and actively represses spes autem obscenas animo demittere non est ausa suo uigilans; placida resoluta quiete saepe uidet, quod amat... {Met. 9, 468-70) and which she recognises and accepts as madness (e.g. at Met. 9, 512, 519, 541). The évocation of the paradigm of the incestuous Byblis in the représentation of the incestuous offspring of Oedipus is itself probably no accident27, but although the two figures are linked by their association with sexual perversity, it is the différences in their responses to sexuality which help to illuminate the character of Ismene. Byblis welcomes her dreams, and eagerly seeks them {Met. 9, 480), while Ismene finds her dream, or at least wishes to find her dream, quite unwelcome. Moreover, Byblis' erotic dreams of incest contrast sharply with Ismene's non-erotic dream of lawful marriage, de- scribed with the vocabulary of legal, socially-acceptable union 26. For the phrase and idea cf. Verg. Ed. 8, 108: an, qui amant, ipsi sibi somnia finguntï 27. Other important antécédents of Ismene's dream include the dream of Ilia at Enn. Ann. 34-50 Sk. (with which see O. Skutsch (éd.) The Annals of Q. Ennius, Oxford 1985, ad loc.) and Dido's dream at Verg. Aen. 4, 465-68, both of which contain erotic undertones.</page><page sequence="17">Sexuality and Madness in Statius* Thebaid 139 (thalamos, conubia, sponsum, foedera). Byblis* dreams fuel the fire of passion she expériences (quem mens mea conapit ignem, Met 9, 520), but Ismene's dream ends with a vision of ignis of a différent sort, fire which portends doom for her betrothed and also for herself (as the Fury-like pursuit of Ismene by Atys' mother also hints); Ismene at once disavows having any under- standing of the portent, denying again that she has any feelings for Atys which might promote such fear, and claims that she only fears for her house and and her brothers. In typically Ovid- ian fashion, Byblis soon talks herself into acting on her feelings; in typically Statian fashion, Ismene denies that her feelings Atys is carried back to the Theban palace, dying and calling out for Ismene. Iocasta summons her daughter, but Ismene does not come: tollebat in ora I uirgo manus, tenuit saeuos pudor (8, 644-5)29. The pudor which Ismene felt at the thought of marriage restrains her from even seeing Atys, but Iocasta eventually forces her to go to him and to behave as a sponsa should (652). Seeing his beloved, Atys dies, and Ismene under- goes a stunning transformation: ibi demum teste remoto I fassa pios gemitus lacrimasque in lumina f udii (653-4). Her weeping eyes become the focus of her acknowledgement of the truth (that is, her true feelings), following in thè family tradition: Oedipus' eyes also became the focal point of his acknowledge- ment of truth, and as such his sight became the site of punish- ment for that truth: impia iam merita scrutatus lumina dextra I merserat aeterna damnatum nocte pudorem I Oedipodes (1, 46- 8)30. By destroying his impious eyes, Oedipus attempted to hide the pudor of his sexual perversity, while Ismene's eyes31, in 28. Similarly, e.g., Oedipus dénies his paternal feelings throughout most of the poem, experiencing a change of heart at 11, 605. 29. Cf. Byblis' resolution, si pudor ora tenebit, I luterà celatos arcana fatebitur ignés (Met. 9, 515-16). 30. In the poem the eyes of Oedipus serve as a metonymy for his sexual perver- sion and madness: so Adrastus tells Polynices that everyone knows regnum et furias oculosque pudentes (1, 684), and Oedipus, reinspired to frenzy against his sons by Tisiphone, inplorat Furias oculosque reposât (7, 469). 31. The eyes are an especially appropriate center for the expression of sexually- charged pudor, since eyes are the traditional location of desire - as a literal focal point of desire, see, e.g., Eurip. Hipp. 525-6 (Έρως Έρως, δ κατ' ομμάτων / στάζεις πόθον) with W. S. Barrett (ed.), Eunpides.

In the eyes of the génération following after and produced by one of the arche- typal incidents of sexual perversion, the loss of sexual purity, even the thought of such a loss in an unperverted sexual union, has become tantamount to perversion itself : purity in a context of perversion is impure, just as sanity (which purity represents) in a context of madness (intimately linked to perversion) is in- sane. Ironically, it is through his death, which forestalls Ismene's actual défloration (as well as his own), that Atys, in a sensé, violâtes Ismene's virginity, without ever physically forc- ing himself on her as his wife, by forcing her to feel and behave like his wife33. Whereas Ismene is overcome by her pudor and weakness in book 8, and appears in the poem only once more, when as a passive and silent figure she witnesses her mother's suicide and apparently follows her example (11, 634-47), Antigone begins to corne into her own in book 11, shortly before her brothers meet in combat. When Iocasta goes to Eteocles so quickly that non ferre piae uestigia natae I aequa ualent (321-2) and in a last desperate effort begs him not to fight Polynices, at parte ex alia tacitos obstante tumultu Antigone furata gradus - nec casta retardât more metaphorical focal point, sec, e.g., Canili. 104, 1-2 (credis me potuisse meae maledicere uitae, I ambobus mihi quae carior est oculisï). 32. Cf. Dido's daim that she would die ante, pudor, quam te uiolo aut tua tura resoluo (Verg. Aen. 4, 27), the effect of her sister's words (spemque dédit dubiae menti soluitque pudorem, Aen. 4, 55), and Dido's accusation of Aeneas that te propter eundem I exstinctus pudor (Aen. 4, 321-2). 33. D. Vessey, in his romande reading of the Atys/Ismene épisode in 'Pierius menti calor incidit': Statius* Epie Style, «Aufst. und Niederg. der röm. Welt» II, 32, 5, Berlin 1986, pp. 2965-3019, notes how the two «denied the lasting fulfilment of marriagc.find consummation» and sûtes that Ismene «has finally been freed from saeuus pudor» at thè end of thè scene by allowing herself - without forsaking dé- corum - to express her dévotion by grieving for her betrothed (pp. 2998-9), but I do not think Ismene's emotional display indicates her freedom from her own sensé of pudor any more than Oedipus' self-inflicted punishment freed him from his sensé of pudor. On the contrary, both are caught up in pudor while trying to elude it.</page><page sequence="19">Sexuality and Madness in Statius* Thebaid 141 uirginitas - uolat Ogygii fastigia muri exsuperare furens; senior comes haeret eunti Actor, et hie summas non duraturus ad arces. (11,354-8) In spite of Antigone's and Ismene's inability to match Iocasta's raving fury, Antigone, now raving herseif (furens)y sneaks away to the walls in such a frenzied state that her elderly companion cannot match her strength. In their parallel attempts to halt Eteocles and Polynices (which nearly sueeeed34), Iocasta and Antigone appropriate and are appropriated by the madness they are attempting to defuse. Only madness can counter mad- ness in the Thebaid; piety and reason, the sorts of things repre- sented by virginity, can get nowhere set against madness35. Antigone, markedly unlike her perverse mother because of her purity, now becomes like her mother in her madness which transcends (but also subsumes) sexuality. The family motto «like father, like son» is finally able to extend itself to «like mother, like daughter», but the extrapolation doesn't end there: both women are likened to paradigmatic mad females who, sig- nificantly, were Theban and their ancestresses. Iocasta seeking Eteocles is likened to Agaue seeking Pentheus (318-20); the dis- turbing discrepancy of thè simile - Agaue's frenzy is aimed at the destruction of her son, while Iocasta's frenzy is aimed at the prévention of her son's destruction - shows up the fact that Iocasta is, in a way, ultimately responsible for her sons' des- truction simply by having coneeived them36. Antigone, perched 34. Polynices' furor begins to subside after hc hears Antigone's frenzied plea, despite Tisiphone's résistance (382-7), only to be rekindled when Megaera thrusts Eteocles outside of Thebes away from his hindering, raving mother (387-8). Tisiphone earlier sûtes that while Fides and Pietas are ineffectuai (98-9) she fears the effect the mother and sister hâve on the brothers (...adfatus matris blandamque precatu I Anngonen timeo, paulum ne nostra retardent I consilia, 103-5). 35. Vividly illustrated by Pietas, who, seeing the brothers preparing for combat and weeping ceu soror infelix pugnantum aut anxia mater (461), intervenes but is chased away by Tisiphone, who taunts her with the fact that Pictzs/pietas has been absent from ail past, madness-laden Theban history (487-92). The intervention of the actual sister and mother was slightly more effective than that of Pietas because unlike the goddess, the human women were not governed wholly by rational piety but also by madness. 36. Cf. Sen. Oed. 1004-7 (after the révélation of the incest): en ecce, rapido saetta prosanti gradu I Iocasta uaecors, qualis attonita etfurens I Cadmea mater abstulit gnato caput I sensitue raptum.</page><page sequence="20">142 Ό ehr a Hershkowitz on thè walls overlooking thè battlefield ex mûris ceu descensura (362), recalls Ino, who, fleeing her mad husband (and in some versions being driven mad herself37), leapt into the sea {non ex- pauerit ingens I Ionium sodo casura Pahemone mater y 1, Π- Ι 4); just as Ino was driven to her leap by her fear of her hus- band's madness (and possibly her own madness) which was caused by Juno's anger at her family connection to Bacchus, so Antigone is driven to her desperate deed by madness associated with her family connections, her fear of her brother's madness and her own madness which in part arises from that fear38. Iocasta and Antigone, then, exhibit frenzy characteristic of and following the pattern of their ancestresses, inherited madness from which, as Theban women, they cannot escape - and, in- deed, must repeat39 - whatever their sexual status. And it is Antigone's sexual status that is subject to slippage when brought into contact with madness. She ceases to behave like the innocent uirgo of the teicboscopia, relying on an elderly guardian for information about the outside world from which she is carefully separated, and instead, leaving her guardian be- hind, she makes her return to the walls, the fringes of that out- side world, alone, nec casta retardât I uirginitas. Strictly speak- ing, Antigone remains a virgin, but, suffused with madness, she does not remain pure40. Her virginity no longer prevents her from fully participating in the impious and sexually-charged madness of her brothers* conflict - it no longer can, and never really had a chance to, because the madness of that conflict is a 37. Cf., perhaps most importantly for Statius, Ov. Met. 4, 420 ss., Ino and Athamas driven mad by Tisiphone at the Orders of Juno. 38. The behaviour of Antigone's cousin Menoeceus, possessed and maddened by Virtus, also hearkens back, in an elevated form, to this ancestral propensity for leaping from heights in times of crisis: atpius electa murorum in parte Menoeceus... I ceu subito in terras supero demissus ab axe, I constitit... (10, 756-9). 39. In yet another instance of the Theban «compulsive répétition of actions from the past» (Zeitlin, op. cit. n. 13). Ovid picks up on this inherited nature of Theban madness when his Juno déclares as Ino's punishment: eatque I per cognata suis exempta furoribus Ino (Met. 4, 431). 40. The Furies, the primary suffusors of madness, set the paradigm for this para- doxical state, being virgins but impure. The maddened Argia paradoxically displays this paradox in reverse, no longer being a virgin but figuring herself as one: haunted by images of her beloved husband, his anxia mentem I aegrescit /unis et, qui castis- simus ardor, I funus amat (12, 193-5); she goes to the battlefield accompanied only by Menoetes, olim hic uirginei custos monitor que pudoris (205).</page><page sequence="21">Sexuality and Madness in Statius' Thebaid 143 manifestation of thè internai madness of Thebes, from which Oedipus' daughters, protectively ensconced deep within Thebes, could not be protected. This is confirmed in book 12, when Antigone ventures out- side the walls of Thebes, intending to burn her brother's corp- se. She hurries from thè city like a virgin lioness, rabies cui libera tandem I etprimus sine matte furor (356-8). With Iocasta dead and Oedipus banished, Antigone finally is free to express the family madness in her own right. On the battlefield in book 12, as in book 11, Antigone's virginity is subject to slippage: right after the uirgo laments that her pious actions were super- seded by Polynices' widow Argia who has beaten Antigone to thè body {...pudet heu! pietas ignaua sororis! 384), the two mourn together over Polynices: hic pariter lapsae iunctoque per ipsum amplexu miscent auidae lacrimasque comasque partitaeque artus redeunt alterna gementes ad uultum et cara uicibus ceruice fruuntur. (12, 385-8) This sexually-charged picture of grief41 of both the wife and the sister vividly illustrâtes the tense apposition of Antigone's vir- ginal purity and the sexually-charged madness that has led her to the battlefield and that prompts her and the equally- maddened Argia to burn Polynices' body - contrary to the edict of Creon - on the funeral pyre. Ismene, subdued by but never embracing madness, cannot act: she stagnâtes into obliv- ion, such a weak figure that even her ultimate defeat, her suicide, appears only in the intimations of a simile. In contrast, Antigone is empowered by the appropriation of madness: it enables her to act, to disobey Creon, to be Antigone, finally living up to her own literary héritage42 as well as her family héritage of madness. 41.

Finding Argia already grasping Polynices' body, Antigone demands cuius ...mânes, aut quae temeraria quaens I nocte mea? (366-7).

Theseus, the Athenian civiliser and human defender of divine justice, is the best candidate the poem and its world can offer to bring this about. The présence of Theseus in the Thebaid, though limited to the second half of the final book of the poem, is important, and the way it is interpreted is a key factor in any rcading of the poem. It is not possible to give a detailed analysis of Theseus hère, but a brief examination of his rôle will be use- ful in summing up the ideas of this paper and showing their importance in shaping an overall reading of the poem. General- ly Theseus is optimistically proclaimed to be the voice of reason which ends the madness of Thebes, restoring sanity to an insane world43. But a différent reading - one which, I would argue, does not remove from the final book the weight of the previous eleven - gives a différent, more pessimistic picture of Theseus and of the world of the Thebaid. Theseus enters thè poem in a triumphal procession, returning to Athens after his latest civilising escapade. His defeated oppo- nents, the Amazons, are paraded with him, along with their uirginei currus (12, 524) and weapons stained with dominarum sanguine (528). By conquering thèse barbarian warrior women and bringing them to civilisation, Theseus has restored to them the proper order of thè universe in which women act like women and stay in the thalamos. Nevertheless, the majority of the Amazons still act in an unfeminine way (ipsae autem non- dum trepidae sexumue fatentur, 529) and seek the temple of a virgin warrior goddess (innuptae quaerunt delubro, Mineruae, 531). By attempting to impose on the Amazons patterns of civilised behaviour which go against their own established be- havioural norms, Theseus has, in a sensé, violated the Ama- zons. This violation is quite literal - and quite sexual - in the case of the de-Amazoned Amazon queen Hippolyte: she has eut her hair, wears a robe that Covers her breasts, accompanies Theseus as a wife (534-9), and, most notably, must forego par- ticipating in battle because she is pregnant (635-8)44. 43.

As Ahi (op. cit. n. 43)</page><page sequence="23">Sexuality and Madness in Statius* Thebaid 145 The Argive widows approach Theseus, begging his aid against the unlawful Creon. Theseus is shocked and angered at Creon's furor, and résolves to do battle with Thebes: ut modo conubiis taurus saltuque recepto cum posuit pugnas, alio si forte remugit bellatore nemus, quamquam ora et colla cruento imbre madent, nouos arma parât campumque lacessens dissimulât gemitus et uulnera puluere celât. (12, 601-5) Fresh from his victory in Scythia, Theseus is ready to meet the new challenge of Thebes just as the bull, fresh from its victory, is ready to meet a new challenger. The bull has recently won a herd of brides; Theseus drives his herd of iemale prisoners through Athens, including his newly-tamed bride. The use of a bull simile for Theseus, and the sexual rivalry that prompts the bull in thè simile to act, however, should be worrying, since it connects the Athenian's actions with those of the Theban brothers, and begs the question of whether Theseus really is, as many readings construct him to be, thè voice (and sword) of reason who brings an end to madness and re-establishes order and sanity in the world. The simile implies that Theseus cannot be isolated from the sexually-charged conflict that has pro- duced and been produced by the furor of Thebes. His actions will be (y et another) répétition of past events. One of the major lessons of the first eleven and a half books of the poem is that the only way to conquer the force of madness is to appropriate its force and be more mad than it is45: for Theseus successfully to fight and defeat thè Thebans he must more than match the Theban madness46. This is well brought out in the mad Creon's points out, the nondum of 529 suggests that «[the Amazons] will be forced, in time, to succumb. These warrior women...face concubinage and slavery which will des- troy theîr pride and independence as surely as their virginity» (p. 2894). 45. E.g. when, as discussed above, Iocasta and Antigone attempt to stop the mad- ness of Polynices and Eteocles by matching it, or when the Furies withdraw from the action when the Fury-inspired human madness outdoes their own. 46. Theseus, on hearing the Argive women, is insta... concitus ira (589), but the idea that ira in any form can be a positive and productive quality is questioned throughout the poem. As Theseus prépares to march on Thebes, Minerva, ready to assist him, acts disturbingly like Tisiphone (ipsa metus Libycos seruatricemque Medusam I pectoris incussa mouit Tntonia parma. I protinus erecti toto simul agmine Thebas I respexere angue s, 606-9).</page><page sequence="24">146 Debra Hershkowitz desperate words to Theseus before their (Polynices vs. Eteo- cles-repeating)47 duel: non cum peltiferis...haec tibi pugna puellis, uirgineas ne crede manus: hic cruda uirorum proelia, nos magnum qui Tydea quique furentem Hippomedonta neci Capaneaque misimus umbris pectora. quae bellum praeceps amentia suasit, improbe? nonne uides, quos ulciscare, iacentis? (12, 761-6) Laughing, Theseus kills the Theban king48, after which the war and the poem wind down to an exhausted, non-conclusive close49. It is the amentia of Thebes which has brought Theseus into the war. He appropriâtes the Theban madness to conquer it, but at the same time is necessarily engulfed by it. The inces- tuous, miasmic madness of the Theban line cannot be elimin- ated. By wiping out the Theban line, Theseus diverts the mad- ness on to a new line, his own, a line which is itself fraught with (Theban-repeating) sexual and familial problems: the death of his father which he caused (recalled in the patronymic Aegides, 769), the abandonnant of Ariadne (hinted at by the last image described from his shield displaying his Cretan victory: absumpto pallentem Gnosidafilo, 676), the violation of Hippo- lyte, and the implicit suggestion of Theseus' future familial des- truction by the mention of the son whom Hippolyte currently bears in her womb (retinet iam certa tumentis I spes uteri, 636- 47. Compare Theseus' sed solum uotis, solum clamore tremendo I omnibus in tur- mis optât uocitatque Creonta (752-3) and the report of Polynices' challenge nomine te crebro, te solum in proelia poscens (11, 245). 48. The action is a Vergilian one - ending the poem with the slaying of an enemy - with a Vergilian justification - figuring that slaying as a sacrifice (Theseus déclares Argolid, quibus haec datur bostia, mânes, pandite Tartareum chaos... 771-2) - but it is performed in a distinctly Statian way (as the rest of Theseus' déclaration before kiÛing Creon chillingly illustrâtes: ...ultricesque parate I Eumenidas, uenit ecce Creonl 772-3). 49. Although not before the Theban women, rejoicing that Theseus has ended the hostilities (but thè Epigoni will come...), and the Argive women, rejoicing that he has enabled them to tend to their dead, act like Bacchantes (Theban women at 787-8; Argive women at 791-3: quale s Bacchea ad bella uocatae I thyiades amentes, magnum quas poscere ere das I aut ferisse nef as). The Argive and Theban women become indistinguishable, ail appearing, because of their frenzied, Bacchic be- haviour, to be Thebans. In this respect Theseus' actions do not curtail the madness of Thebes but lead directly to an expanded résurgence of it.</page><page sequence="25">Sexuality and Madness in Statius' Tbebaid 147 7). Rather than forcing the inscription of sanity and reason on mad Thebes and ending the poem with a triumphant flourish of rationality, Theseus is himself inscribed, along with the rationality he purports to represent, within the overwhelming madness of the Thebaid.
