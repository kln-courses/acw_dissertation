<plain_text><page sequence="1">STONE SCULPTURE IN THE CALLEJON DE HUAYLAS Richard Schaedel ONE of the most archaeologically significant characteristics of highland Andean cul tures is the stone-sculpturing tradition. Most of the reports that have been published to date deal with the more spectacular sites of Tia huanaco in the south highlands and Chavin de Huantar in the north highlands, but little has appeared to indicate the widespread existence of stone sculpture throughout the Peruvian highlands and the centers where the tradition is particularly strong. It is the purpose of this paper to summarize the stone sculpture in the Callejon de Huaylas area and to indicate its relationship to the accepted archaeological horizons in the north highlands. Since the stone sculpture at Chavin de Huantar has been recently summarized by Bennett1 and Kroeber,2 it will be omitted from the present discussion except insofar as it relates to the material here presented. Exclusive of Chavin, then, the area with which we have to deal includes all the Peruvian highlands from Aija on the south to Huambos on the north. Most of the sites where stone sculpture has been reported fall between the two ranges of the Cordillera, predominantly in the Callejon de Huaylas. Some that will be discussed, however, are on the western slopes of the Cordillera Negra and others on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera Blanca, with the sites of Tinyash and Chachapoyas very close to the upper waters of the Marafion. Within this area there are some 300 odd pieces so far reported, of which 181 are repre sentations of the human figure, 46 are puma slabs, and 65 human and animal heads and head tenons. (The term "puma slab" refers to slabs with relief carving.) In addition there is a mis cellaneous assortment of dressed stones and slabs which fall outside of the three major categories of stone sculpture. In summarizing the group, our procedure will be to describe the regional groupings, wherever possible defining the regional style for each variety of stone sculpture (statues, puma slabs, etc.). Then we shall give the evidence for the relationship of the three main varieties of stone 1 Bennett, 1942. 2 Kroeber, 1944, pp. 81-90. sculpture to each other, e.g., statues to puma slabs. Finally we shall marshal all the evidence for the specific assignment of some of the stone sculpture to periods in the established archae ological sequence and indicate the probable assignment of the rest. Before proceeding, it must be remarked that complete descriptions will only be furnished for the stone sculpture in the regions of Aija and Huaraz, where the availability of adequate photographs and drawings makes a detailed study possible. For the other regions the best that can be done is to indicate the varieties of stone sculpture so far reported and their prob able relationship to the material in the better known regions. This analysis is based largely upon field notes obtained by Bennett in 1938. STATUES Aija Aija, which is separated from the Callejon de Huaylas by the Cordillera Negra, is a more convenient starting point for our description than the Callejon proper, both because of the greater certainty of provenience of the stone sculpture and the greater homogeneity of the representations, which allows for the definition of a style. The Aija style is represented by sixteen statues of the Warrior type and by eleven of the Woman type. The two types were first recognized by Tello,3 and subsequent study of additional statues confirms this distinction as a useful and valid one. The Warrior type4 is represented as squatting on the heels with the knees drawn up and the toes pointing in toward the center of the statue. The right hand grasps a club which rests on the right shoulder, and the left projects forward from a shield which covers the left arm. A trophy head is suspended from the neck. The statues range from 93 to 131 centimeters high. The headdress is usually decorated with full 3 Tello, 1923, p. 237. 4 For illustrations of the Warrior type see: Tello, 1923, Figs. 41, 43, 44; Tello, 1930, Fig. 15, lower, Fig. 16; Tello, 1929, Figs. 41-3; Bennett, 1944a, PI. 8, g.

Aija Type Warrior Headdress. to be more significant design elements (Fig. 55). Hair is shown on the back as a mat in the shape of the blade of a paddle. The ears are usually covered by an ear-flap which may also be part of the headgear. Variations are circular and semicircular outlining of the ears and one in which a semilunar earring projects from the ear-flap. The eye is circular in shape and the eyeball is usually outlined. Squarish and ovoid eyes occur as variants. The nose has a charac teristic "pudgy" appearance and is rounded, although angular modeling is a variant and indicates a different type of chiseling tool. The mouth is commonly indicated by a lateral slit or groove. The outlining of the two closed lips occurs rarely. The chin is characteristically rounded or pointed, but a squarish variant occurs. The neck is the most deeply carved out portion of the statue. It is usually plain but in some statues it is adorned with a collar or necklace. The digits of the hands may be delineated as fingers or by obscure incised designs suggesting claws. The thumb of the right hand is usually extended. The trophy in unusual cases is sus pended by the hair from the right hand. Typi Fig. 56. Aija Type Warrior Trophy Heads. cally, however, it is represented hanging from the neck by means of, or without, straps. The mouth end is up, and the hair hangs in straight vertical lines (Fig. 56). The feet, like the hands, may be decorated with incised designs or real istically carved to represent toes. The back in all but one statue is adorned with a suspended trophy head similar to the one in front. The exception is an elaborately decorated statue which is also unique for the Warrior type in representing clothing. The back and sides down to the knees are covered by relief design of alternating bird and arachnif orm figures and suggests a large garment (Fig. 57). A decorated rectangular plaque above the left shoulder is also peculiar to this statue. The shields (Fig. 58) are rectangular and the design consists of diagonally crossed straps with relief designs in the trapezoidal interstices. iiih /ri |] L \l \&amp; j / /JuJ Fig. 57. Aija Type Warrior Back Designs. Other design types are lines radiating from a central circle and an over-all double-headed serpent. In all but the last type, a circular face is indicated in the center of the shield. Three protuberances of unknown significance hang below the shield. The Woman type5 is represented in the same sitting or squatting position. The hands are extended forward on the same level with a flap-like object between them that greatly resembles the trophy head in the same frontal area on the Warrior type. The back is decorated with a plaque of the same general appearance as the shield. The size is slightly smaller than the statues of the Warrior type. 5 For illustrations of the Woman type see: Tello, 1923, Figs. 39, 40; Tello, 1930, Figs. 14, 15, upper; Tello, 1929, Figs. 40 and 45; Bennett, 1944a, PL 8, e, f.</page><page sequence="3">68 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 4 The headband has a circular disc or clasp shaped object in front.

When not covered by the hair, the ear is delineated by a semilunar outline. In several statues fan-shaped earrings6 for straps rest on the shoulders. The eyes are charac teristically ovoid or circular. Loop-shaped eyes occur as variants. The eyeball is generally outlined. The nose is the same as for the Warrior type. A deep lateral groove characterizes the mouth. The chin is rounded or pointed, and the neck is deeply hollowed and undecorated.

The position of the hands varies from both hands at the waist separated by the central flap to both hands under the neck with a space 6 Seler (1893, PL 14) illustrates an anthropomorphic vase with an alleged provenience of Huaraz in which the fan shaped attachment is clearly part of the earring. between them. In one statue the hands are be low a bag or purse-like object. The digits of the hand may be clearly defined fingers or have a clawlike appearance. The thigh and legs are more often represented entirely on the side plane than in the Warrior type, with only the toes shown on the front surface. The frontal space is occupied by a flap (Fig. 60) usually divided into an upper part with two circular discs and a larger lower part of parallel vertical lines or a plain rectangular field. A variant is the purse-like container already men tioned. The general appearance of the flap sug gests a stylized trophy head. All the statues of this type have some ele ment of what might be called clothing, either straps with frontal flap, a decorated waist band, a mantle of varying lengths on the back, with or without a central plaque, or any com bination of these. The sequence of decoration Fig. 60. Aija Type Woman Frontal Flap. on the back is hair, plaque or mantle, lower border beneath the plaque, and decorated base (Fig. 61). In some only the plaque is repre sented. The design on the plaque consists of diagonally crossed straps, single, double, or triple, with a central face design and decorated intersticial panels. In addition to the twenty-seven statues de scribed there are three others in worn condi tion. Not enough details could be ascertained to allow them to be classified into one of the two types, but such features as can be observed occur within the limits of variation for the Aija style. This style can now be defined for all the statues from Aija as constituting the following: 1. The entire body is represented or implied by the un defined area and the over-all shape of the stone. The shape varies from the usual truncated cone to triangular, rec tangular, or prismatic. The average height is 1 meter. 2. Emphasis is on the head which occupies from one third to one-half of the total frontal surface. It has the</page><page sequence="4">schaedel] A REAPPRAISAL OF PERUVIAN ARCHAEOLOGY 69 deepest carving at the neck, nose, and eyebrows. The ex tremities are carved in much shallower relief. 3. The head is always decorated, either with a simple band and hair design, or in more imposing headdresses, with pumas and other zoomorphic figures in varying degrees of relief. 4. The eyes, nose, chin, and hands are always indicated. The hands never cross and are represented at approxi mately the same height on, or approaching, the front plane of the statue. 5. The eyes stand out in relatively deep relief from the hollowed-out area beneath the temples, although in some instances they are indicated by only slightly raised surfaces. The eyeball is usually outlined. 6. The nose has a characteristically pudgy appearance and stands out in rather deep relief at the base. 7. Lip modeling is rare, and cheek modeling does not occur. 8. The mouth is usually slit- or groove-shaped. No teeth are shown. 9. The hollowed-out area defining the neck is the most deeply carved portion of the statues. In profile it frequently lends an exaggerated emphasis to the chin. 10. Genitals are never represented. 11. The feet always point to the center of the statue and are on the same level. They are drawn back under, or slightly forward of, the thighs. 12. All figures carry or wear something in front and back. Huaraz The largest clustering of statues is in the Callejon de Huaylas. Where the provenience is known it is Huaraz or its immediate vicinity; and if we allow a certain tolerance for the range of distribution of the statues in the collections of the Huaraz Museum, Chiclin, and Soriano, the designation Huaraz may be safely adopted as a shorter and more convenient term for the statues of the Callejon de Huaylas. Whereas the statues from Aija are charac terized by their homogeneity and stylistic con sistency, those from Huaraz are best charac terized by the number and variety of the styles represented. Because of the great degree of overlap, it is impossible to isolate distinct styles on any but a highly subjective basis. A further limitation to a stylistic break-down is imposed by the necessity of studying the detail of the statues from photographs and rough field sketches. As a result the only traits which were found to be universally comparable for all of the Huaraz statues were those which happened to be the most readily observed, such as foot position, hand position, size, relative thickness of limbs, and the presence or absence of genitals, ornaments, clothing or weapons. A series of major groupings was established on the basis of these traits. Whether true slabs, in which only the front surface or a part of it is carved, should be regarded as significantly distinct from true statues carved in the round is a difficult ques tion to decide. Since both extremes and all in termediate stages are represented at Huaraz, I have designated all representations of the human figure as statues. Where slabs seem to form distinct groups or sub-groups on the basis of the same foot position and one or more ad ditionally shared traits, I have regarded the slab technique as secondarily diagnostic. Other wise, I regard them as "slab variants.'' It should be possible to establish valid stylistic subdivi sions at Huaraz on the basis of a detailed first Fig. 61. Aija Type Woman Back Designs. hand study of the material there and at other less known sites in the north highlands, and that is one of the objectives of my present field trip. For the present, the classification into groups adequately expresses the variety of the statues at Huaraz and indicates the relative extent to which local and external develop ments in stone sculpture were operative: Group A, legs crossed, toes pointing outward to sides of statue: 49 or 39% of all the statues. Group B, feet position as in Aija statues: 19 or 15% of all the statues. Group C, knees drawn up on front plane, but toes pointing outward as in Group A: 18 or 14% of all the statues. Group D, knees drawn up, toes pointing down: 8 or 8% of all the statues. Group E, sitting position, feet and toe position indeter minate : 6 or 5% of all the statues.</page><page sequence="5">70 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 4 Group F, standing position, feet pointing in, down, or out: 6 or 5% of all the statues. Group G, squatting position, feet spread, toes pointing out: 3 or 2% of all the statues. Group H, semi-statues in which no feet are represented or intended. Some extend to the waist and show hands: 16 or 13% of all the statues. The first and largest group (Fig. 62) at Huaraz comprises all statues in which the legs are crossed.7 This position occurs only in Huaraz. Most of the statues in this group are distinguished by the absence of any decoration or adornment other than the headdress. The height varies from 60 to 90 centimeters. Green granite is the most frequently used material. That the statues represent males is indicated by the presence of genitals underneath the crossing of the legs in most of the statues. Fig. 62. Huaraz Group A. When the genitals are not represented, there is no corresponding change in the statue to in dicate the opposite sex. The headdress is usually smaller than the male headdress in Aija. It is decorated with puma heads, "hands and feet," curvilinear designs suggesting the sling used as a head dress, and complete profile pumas. Hair is never represented. Facial details vary considerably. The ears are portrayed as slightly raised and circular in outline, but they may be ovoid, loop-shaped, "S"-shaped, or semicircular in outline as in the statues at Aija. Eyes show much the same variation with the addition of a squarish type. The circular contour is most common, and in half of the statues the eyeball is outlined. The nose is predominantly rectangular with a tendency towards the trapezoidal in outline. 7 See Bennett, 1944a, Fig. 33, e, for illustration of this group. In modeling, it is more often angular than rounded, the reverse of the situation in Aija. The mouth is characteristically delineated by a lateral groove, but variations of the slit and lip outlined types which have been noted in Aija occur. Teeth are a characteristic of a small sub group to be described presently. The chin is usually rounded, although rare variations are more angular and squared. The neck is usually plain and not as deeply hollowed out as in the statues from Aija. In a few statues the neck is adorned with a collar or necklace. The hands are always resting on their respective knees. The legs are crossed right over left in the majority of cases, but the reverse occurs. The back is seldom decorated. There is a small sub-group of five statues8 in which the feet are crossed but in which the figure is shown holding a club. Other atypical characteristics of this sub-group are: the ab sence of genitals, back decorated with one or more trophy heads, trophy heads in front sus pended from the neck or hands, a deeply carved neck space, and usually a double row of teeth. In four statues the left arm is covered by a shield. The shields are square and appreciably smaller than those in Aija. In the three clear examples of shield design, only the crossed strap motive is represented. The club rests on the left shoulder in three of the statues instead of on the right as at Aija. Also different from Aija are the trophies, which are smaller, lack hair, and hang right side up. With the exception of this small sub-group, the first group of statues in Huaraz can be re garded as composed of a number of statues most of which represent a local Huaraz style. At the present time, however, the stylistic con formity of the group shows up only in the fre quency or rarity of occurrence, within the group as a whole, of certain comparable traits. The small sub-group shows gross icono graphic similarity to the Warrior type at Aija, but on closer examination the resemblances are confined to the club-shield-trophy head com plex. The posture and morphological charac teristics relate this sub-group more closely to the other less ornate statues in Group A. An "Aija-like" subdivision at Huaraz may be established from the statues in Group B, and a sub-group of Group C. Of the statues in 8 Some idea of the characteristic appearance of this sub group can be obtained from the group photograph in Borchers, 1935, p. 352, statue on the near left.</page><page sequence="6">schaedel] A REAPPRAISAL OF PERUVIAN ARCHAEOLOGY 71 Group B, six have a closer resemblance to the Warrior type in Aija than any other statues in Huaraz (Fig. 63). They are shown with the club usually on the right shoulder and the shield on the left arm. The trophy head is represented "mouth-end up," and only in this group are. such Aija traits represented as hair on males, semilunar earrings, shield designs of the radiat ing lines type, and over-all serpent. Unfor tunately, the remaining statues are in such poor condition that it is impossible on the basis of the photographs and drawings to determine the detail in most cases. Nevertheless, there is the significant occurrence within the group of such Aija-like elements as the frontal flaplike object, fan-shaped earrings or straps, and indications of clothing. None of the statues in Group B, however, conforms to all of the specifications previously listed for Aija style. In one or another of the group occur such non-Aija traits as genitals, teeth, upright trophy heads, and small human figures. Group C is composed of two significant sub divisions distinguished from each other by relative size and thickness of limbs. The sub group of large statues (Fig. 64), averaging 90 centimeters and with realistic limb representa tion, affiliates closely with the Woman type in Aija.9 Such traits as hair braids, fan-shaped earrings, and over-all back decoration in com Fig. 63. Huaraz Group B. bination with the absence of genitals occur more frequently in this sub-group than in any other major grouping in Huaraz. The arachni 9 For illustrations of front view of this sub-group, see Borchers, 1935, p. 352, second from far right. For rear view see Bennett, 1944a, Fig. 33, d. form design applied to the sides and back of the figure is one of the closest parallels between Aija and Huaraz statues which occurs in this group. Except for the leg position and the Fig. 64. Huaraz Group C. pronounced forward hunching of the shoulders, several examples of this sub-group could be included in the Aija style. It is worth noting that only in this Aija like subdivision in Huaraz do we find female figures. The predominant emphasis in Huaraz statues, especially in Group A, is oh males, specifically on the membrum virile. The more diminutive statues that comprise the other sub-group of Group C and the non slab sub-group of Group D (most of which are also diminutive) form a second subdivision at Huaraz. Because of their apparent affiliations with the diminutive statues from Huantar (to be described presently), I have termed them "Huantar-like." These statues average 50 centimeters in height and, except for the char acteristic thin, stick-like limbs, show little detail. Five statues from Group C and five from Group D comprise this Huantar-like sub division which is in strong contrast to the nearly life-size, realistic sculpture of Aija and the Aija-like subdivision at Huaraz. The slabs which constitute the remainder of Group D are few in number and so badly worn that it is impossible to obtain further criteria for comparison than foot position and size. Group E includes the few statues in Huaraz in which the sitting position is either inter mediate between the positions characteristic of the major groupings or cannot be accurately determined. Groups F and G are the smallest groups and consist mostly of true slabs.</page><page sequence="7">72 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 4 Group H10 includes all semi-statues. While they have a wide distribution, they resemble the complete statues in the regions in which they are found with respect to the few features that can be compared. These do not add signifi cantly to the repertoire of comparable traits. Huantar Huantar is represented by fifteen small statues, all of them about 50 centimeters or less in height (Fig. 65). They are carved, for the most part, only on the front surface, although the head is occasionally represented in the round. Characteristic of the group is a thin, stick-like representation of the arms and legs. When portrayed, the toes point down or out, never toward the center of the statue. The facial details and headdresses cannot be com pared because of the inadequacy of the il lustrations. In general, the statues may be described as essentially two-dimensional, al though the third dimension is suggested by the sBa mm \M \^i\\ Bfl qd 59 ^^ Fig. 65. Huantar Style. unorthodox convolutions of the extremities. The conventionalization of this type of carving was apparently responsible for the foot posi tions of Groups C and D in Huaraz. Miscellaneous At Chacas, a town slightly to the north of Huantar and likewise on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera Blanca, two monoliths are re ported, one with the arms folded across the breast and the other with arms upraised under the chin. The foot position of both indicates a sitting pose with the legs drawn in under the rest of the body. If these statues are related to the material previously described, their closest affinity is with Group E in Huaraz. This sitting position with legs drawn in, strongly reminis cent of the mummy crouch, is so prevalent throughout the north highlands and occurs so infrequently elsewhere that it must be regarded as a general north highland trait in the repre sentation of the human figure. 10 Borchers (1935, p. 292) illustrates an example of this group from Carhuaz. The statue discovered by Wiener11 in Caja bamba to the north of Huamachuco shows a similar crouched position with the hands up raised under the chin. The slab from Cabana, also reported by Wiener,12 shows striking iconographic similarity with the slabs of Group F in which the feet point out. The standing figure from Cabana shares with those in Huaraz the collar around the neck and the long club held diagonally across the body in addition to the over-all pose. Cabana is north of the Callejon de Huaylas. The slab from Tinyash13 shows a squatting figure similar to the slabs of Huaraz Group G which are in turn similar to the central figure on the puma slabs to be described presently. Tin yash is on the Maranon and the easternmost site under discussion. From Catan on the western slopes of the Cordillera Negra, Horkheimer has reported a slab with the Aija foot position and a club on the left shoulder. While specifically quite dis tinct (the figure is only 50 centimeters high), the slab is generally related to the iconography of Aija and the Aija-like subdivisions in Huaraz.14 As such it represents the northern most extension of north highland statues. Summary Although not enough is known of the stone sculpture outside of Huaraz and Aija, some significant observations may be made concern ing north highland statues in general: 1. At Aija there is a well-defined style of carving statues. It consists of two types: Warrior and Woman. 2. At Huantar there is another local tradition of carving statues, which in size, relative thickness of limbs, and foot position are in marked contrast with Aija statuary. 3. At Huaraz, where there is the greatest number and complexity of statues, two developments are evident: a) A predominant, local tradition of carving which is represented by Group A. Statues with the characteristic crossed-leg position of this group occur in no other area; but the sporadic occurrence within the group of charac teristics of other sculptural traditions prevents us from de fining a Huaraz style. b) Groupings which indicate affiliations with other traditions: (1) The most numerous of these are Groups B and C, which constitute the Aija-like subdivision. Group B and half of Group C are shown to be related to the Warrior and Woman types of Aija, respectively. 11 Wiener, 1880, p. 137. 12 Wiener, 1880, p. 496. 13 Antunez de Mayolo, 1935, Fig. 15. 14 Horkheimer, 1944, Fig. 20.</page><page sequence="8">schaedel] A REAPPRAISAL OF PERUVIAN ARCHAEOLOGY 73 (2) Part of Groups C and D (the next largest group in Huaraz) relate to the diminutive Huantar tradition and constitute the Huantar-like subdivision. (3) The groups which are least represented at Huaraz, F and G, have affinities with statues (actually slabs) from more distant areas to the north and east. (4) Semi-statues have a wide distribution and are similar to the complete statues in the regions in which they are found. (5) The position of the figure sitting with the knees drawn in underneath the body is a general north highland trait and relates the statues from Chacas and Cajabamba to the north highland sculpturing tradition. PUMA SLABS The manner of representing the puma in the north highlands is restricted to two conven tions; entirely profile, or with full face and profile body. The pose in turn is restricted to a few significant variations. In the Callejon de Huaylas and Aija the pose is, with one ex ception, that of a crouched animal. The degree Fig. 66. Type One Puma Slab. of back-arching varies, but the front and hind paws are invariably on the same level. To the north of this area the puma is represented rear ing on its hind legs with the front paws ex tended forward parallel to the hind paws, and the tail curled behind or below the puma. A variant of this position occurs in one example from San Benito in the Tantarica region il lustrated by Horkheimer15 in which the animal is shown with front and hind paws on the same level, but obviously not crouching. It is pos sible that the slab should be turned on its side so that the pose of the animal approximates a rearing puma; or it may represent a puma on a limb, directing its attention to the area beneath it. A single variation on the position of the full face puma is represented by the Huambos slab in which the puma is shown as though poised on a limb; the hind paws are lower than the fore-paw's. This may also be the pose of an in cised slab from Chacas, but the claw detail is missing. However, the style of carving is so *5 Horkheimer, 1944, Fig. 21. distinct, the slabs should not be considered significantly similar. According to the two modes of representing the puma face and the three variations in the Fig. 67. Type Two Puma Slab. pose, it is possible to establish five puma types which are sufficient to designate all the known representations of the animal. Type I is defined as the profile, crouching puma (Fig. 66). It occurs singly, in combination with another puma of the same type, and with a central human figure or face. Type II is the puma with profile body and full face (Fig. 67). It also occurs singly, doubly, and in combination with a central human figure or other creature. Type III is denned as the double-headed puma (Fig. 68). It occurs only with the full-face and represents the bodies of two pumas joined at the inception of the arch of the back. Only the front paws and the heads are represented. It occurs alone and with a human figure on the side. There are two diminutive examples of this type without the human figure. Type IV represents the rearing puma in profile (Fig. 69). It occurs singly and in various forms of composition of which there is only one example for each variation. The variations are: (1) two facing pumas with a profile human figure to the side of each puma, (2) a puma with central human face or figure, and (3) a pair of facing pumas above and below a central circular face-design. Type V is a miscellaneous category for the slabs from Chacos and Huambos and represents the full-face puma in the attitude of sitting on a tree limb. Under the foregoing type classification can be included all 47 slabs or fragments from the north highlands of Peru. Six out of the seven puma slabs from Aija form the basis for what may be called the Aija style of puma slabs. Fig. 68. Type Three Puma Slab. These are all full-face or Type II pumas. The style has the following characteristics:16 16 Tello, 1923, Figs. 33 and 34.</page><page sequence="9">74 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 4 Composition: when more than one puma is represented the pumas face center with the central figure between them. Type of carving: usually moderately deep relief with the eyes outstanding. Detail: Eyes: usually outlined. Ears: rounded or rounded triangle. Teeth: either with projecting or prominent canines. Tail position: varies between curled back, curled down, and volute. Claws: delineated by incised lines or grooves separating the digits. In Huaraz, in a comparable group of Type II slabs, all these features occur individually or in combinations of two or three; but the complex is never complete enough to allow for the classification of any of the slabs as Aija style. Fig. 69. Type Four Puma Slab. In defining a Huaraz style it is convenient to describe certain features and the range of variations which contrasts with the slabs of the Aija style. The Huaraz style includes the puma Types I, II, and III. The composition is quite varied, e.g., the human figure may be at either side of the pumas, and the pumas may face in either direction or back to back. The type of carving varies from very deep to shallow relief. The eyes of the pumas are usually not out lined. The ears on the Type II pumas are usu ally squared and outlined. The teeth vary from projecting to prominent canines, to a double row of teeth to no teeth at all. The tail is curled in all but the down position as in the Aija slabs, but in addition two types of volutes in down ward winding are to be remarked. Most dis tinctive of Huaraz pumas are the volute designs that delineate the claws and the demarcation of the wrist by a groove or incised line. Two sub-styles can now be described. Sub Style 1 includes all of the Type II pumas and some of Type I. The predominant composition is with the pumas facing a central figure. The relief is deep to moderately deep. The Type I pumas are distinguished by ears which flap forward. Teeth are represented in both types with projecting or prominent canines. All tail positions are represented. The chin is rounded. Sub-Style 2 consists of only pumas of Type I. All varieties of composition occur except that in which the pumas face a central figure. The carving is shallow to moderately deep re lief, eyes are not outstanding, and clear-cut delineation of features is characteristic. Ears are usually flapped backward or pointed back. The tail is consistently curled up in a back volute fashion. The chin is squared and angular. The single profile puma slab from Aija be longs in Sub-Style 2. An angularly outlined variant of Sub-Style 1 is reported from the general Callejon de Huaylas area and may represent a regional variation. The two slabs illustrated by Tello17 indicate a regional varia tion in which jagged teeth and serrated ap pendages issue from the pumas' mouths or snouts. The occurrence in one of a central face with serrated appendages is also atypical. The Type III puma has already been men tioned in describing the general Huaraz style. The diminutive variety is illustrated by Bennett.18 Type IV slabs occur with one exception to the north of the Callejon de Huaylas.19 The composition varies considerably, but the detail of the puma for the most part is quite similar to Sub-Styles 1 and 2. As more examples of Type IV are found it may be possible to isolate regional styles such as was done with Types I and II; for the present these slabs can only be considered from the stand point of their affiliation with the better known types of the Callejon de Huaylas. A summary of the puma slabs leads to the following observations: 1. Type II puma slabs occur as the predominant type in Aija where they form a distinct style. 2. Types I, II, III, and IV are represented in Huaraz. The most frequent types are I and II, which form the basis for a stylistic subdivision; Type III conforms to the general Huaraz style. 17 Tello, 1923, Figs. 35 and 37. 18 Bennett, 1944a, Fig. 33, b. 19 For examples from Cabana, see Wiener, 1880, p. 702; from Santiago de Chuco, see Horkheimer, 1944, Fig. 36; from Huamachuco, see McCown, 1945, PL 17: 1.</page><page sequence="10">schaedel] A REAPPRAISAL OF PERUVIAN ARCHAEOLOGY 75 3. Type IV is represented by a single slab in Huaraz but forms part of northern puma slab tradition. HEADS Head sculpture in the north highlands oc curs both with and without the tenons for wall insertion. In Aija, Caras, Cabana, Huari, and Huamachuco the head without tenon is reported. Human heads with tenons occur in Huaraz but not in Aija, and in the northern sites such as Santiago de Chuco and Huamachuco. Like the semi-statues there are few diagnostic features which allow for general comparison, and the affiliations that can be determined by the head dress designs indicate relationship with other sculpture in the same area. Thus, at Aija, the headdress shows the arachniform design, at Huaraz "hands and feet"; at Huamachuco, where no statues were reported, the prevailing type is shown with large earplugs and head dress styles of a general north Peruvian dis tribution. The well-modeled heads from Caras and Cabana and the unusual head at Huari present problems awaiting scientific explora tion of these regions. The general trait of heads and head tenons is associated with Chavin de Huantar and Tiahuanaco and is probably a basic heritage of all highland cultures. Puma heads are reported from Aija, Huaraz, Santiago de Chuco, Huamachuco, and Cabana. The contrast between the type of puma head in Aija and Huaraz and the type from Cabana and Huamachuco reflects the distinction al ready observed in the puma slab carving. The puma heads from Aija and Huaraz are carved in deep relief and represent the full-face view; those from Cabana and Huamachuco are carved in shallower relief and represent the profile puma. The regional distinctions between Aija and Huaraz already noted in the puma slab carving are also reflected in the puma heads. Modeling is generally more rounded in Aija, eyeballs are outlined, prominent canines are more common, and prominent eyebrow ridges are distinctive of Aija. Other animals besides the puma are repre sented in Cabana and the region north of the Callejon de Huaylas. It is possible to set up classificatory criteria for a detailed inventory of the numerous heads and head tenons so far reported, but with a few exceptions the indis pensable data on size, material used, description of all surfaces, etc., are either lacking or so in completely given that any conclusions based upon them would be both premature and prob ably misleading. MISCELLANEOUS The miscellaneous stone sculpture is men tioned here briefly to indicate the occurrence within the north highlands of certain tech niques and design elements which are either atypical or represent influences from more distant stone-sculpturing centers. The slabs from Chacas include one incised condor design, a relief of a curled serpent, and part of a larger slab showing a sitting human figure in three-quarter view. Geometrically designed dressed stones are reported from Huaraz, Cabana, and Huamachuco. A slab with a carved human head and one with a snake from Chachapoyas and a small animal carved in the round from Huaraz complete the assortment. Fig. 70. Aija Statue and Recuay Ceramic Designs. INTERRELATIONSHIPS Stone Sculpture A detailed analysis of the design elements indicates the following interrelationships be tween the three major varieties of stone sculp ture : 1. Aija statuary contains a repertoire of design elements that are represented on the puma slabs of both Aija and Huaraz and on the Huaraz statues of Group C which re semble the woman type in Aija. These are: Types I, II, and III of pumas, the arachniform design, sun face, and the bird. 2. The central figure in the Aija puma slabs is closely identified with the central figure of the Huaraz puma slabs. They are both represented with spread legs, out-pointing toes, hands either supporting the cephalic appendages or holding a club and trophy head, and with a headdress of either cephalic appendages or the "hands and feet" design. Those with the club and trophy point to a close relationship with the Aija statues of the Warrior type and the Aija like statues of Huaraz. 3. The headdress designs on human heads and head tenons indicate close similarities to the headdress of the human statues in the area from which they are reported. 4. In general the full-face puma, the representation of the entire puma, and the arachniform design are charac teristic of Aija, while in Huaraz the profile puma, usually</page><page sequence="11">76 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 4 reduced to a series of heads or claws, and the volute -as a design element are more typical. Ceramics and Architecture Pottery and architecture are the main diag nostics of the chronological sequence of north highland cultures as established by Bennett and correlated with McCown's data from Huamachuco: North Highlands Huamachuco Miscellaneous Late Late Huamachuco Black-White-Red Wilkawafn-Tiahuanaco Katak Middle Huamachuco Recuay Huaraz White-on-Red Chavin The identification of stone sculpture at Chavin de Huantar with the architecture and pottery design is well established. For the White-on-Red period such limited material is available for comparison that no relationship to the stone sculpture can be determined as yet. The evidence for the association of Aija and Huaraz stone sculpture with Recuay pottery has been emphasized by Tello,20 but his pub lished illustrations are not convincing. Until more information on the design of Recuay pottery is available, we shall have to be content with pointing out a few significant illustra trations (Fig. 70). The best example of the affiliation of Recuay pottery with the statues is the anthropomorphic vase illustrated by Schmidt21 in which a seated warrior is shown with a club on the right shoul der and a shield in the left hand. The shield is decorated with the double-headed serpent design. While this vase links some of the statues of the Warrior type in Aija to Recuay pottery, there is no corresponding illustration of any Huaraz statue. The best illustration of Recuay pottery affiliations with the puma slabs is the design from a Copa vase published by Tello.22 The closest resemblance is to the Huaraz style. The composition is strikingly similar, but the detail is unique in several respects. Most Recuay pottery emphasizes the profile puma of the Types I and IV. The representa tion of cephalic appendages is frequent and in dicates a close connection between the slabs 20 Tello, 1930, p. 289. 21 Schmidt, 1929, p. 237. 22 Tello, 1923, Fig. 32. from Cajamarquilla (Huaraz region) and Cabana with Recuay designs (Fig. 71). Finally, a vase representing an apparently subterranean house type illustrated by Wiener23 shows a lintel decorated with the Type I profile pumas. Tello mentions a number of Recuay vases which portray "shrines and terraces whose walls are decorated . . . with sculptured human heads and which seem to be imbedded in them."24 Unfortunately, none of these vases has been il lustrated. Summing up the evidence for the Recuay period, we find the ceramics are definitely asso ciated with Aija and Aija-like statues (though not all of them), with puma slabs of Types I, II, and IV (and possibly III; see Fig. 72), and probably with head tenons on the strength of Tello's statement. The single relationship between the stone sculpture and the Katak period is a painted lintel described by Bennett25 in a structure in the region around Katak. The structure is described as "Central Subterranean Chamber with Connecting Side Chambers." The design on the lintel corresponds very closely to the Type III double-headed puma. The occurrence of puma heads in the Wilka wain-Tiahuanaco period in association with above-ground three-storied temples has also been established by Bennett.26 Unfortunately, a photograph of the tenon head in situ at Caras was not clear enough for any observation other than the fact that it was a puma head. Fig. 71. Cabana Statue and Recuay Ceramic Designs. 23 Wiener, 1880. 24 Tello, 1930, p. 289. 25 Bennett, 1944a, pp. 64^5. Assignment of this structure to the Katak period is based on personal communication with Bennett. 26 Bennett, 1944a, p. 17. It is noted that the three-storied temple at Wilkawafn doubtless had such puma head tenons also.</page><page sequence="12">schaedel] A REAPPRAISAL OF PERUVIAN ARCHAEOLOGY 77 Further associations of the stone sculpture with this or any of the late periods do not occur on the basis of present knowledge. Having established a connection between some of the stone sculpture with the Recuay, Katak, and Wilkawain-Tiahuanaco periods, what remains to be said about the far more numerous residue of unassociated stone sculp ture, particularly the statues? The definite assignment of all of the statues, puma slabs, etc., cannot be made until more thorough in vestigations in the north highlands are carried out. However, as a result of studying the il lustrations of the 300 odd specimens of stone sculpture, I believe it possible to establish three distinct phases of statue carving which represent a developmental sequence and which may be correlated in a general way with the chronological sequence for the north highlands. Statues in which the details are represented by continuous curvilinear lines represent Phase 1. The lips consist of incised bands which wind, ribbon-like, around the cheeks and form the ears; the eyes in similar fashion are defined by a loop which continues up over the forehead and into the headdress. Extremities which at first ' glance suggest arms and legs turn out to be in tricate serpentiform designs which trail off into the less distinct portions of the statue. The most frequently observed convention repre sents the two arms emerging from either side as serpents. The feet also are incised so as to represent or suggest animal and bird heads. Phase 2 consists of statues in which the head dresses are delineated in relief and in which the boundaries of the details are clearly demarcated as anatomical entities. The digits are not always fingers, but one hand is usually so represented and the other is claw-like. The feet are similarly conceived. Incision is occasionally used in some of the statues to represent applied symbolic designs. Phase 3 attains to no greater mastery of carving in the round, but the relief technique assumes a more linear aspect which exploits the play of light and shade to emphasize the design. Incision is not used, and the sculpture is charac terized by a flamboyant display of design ele ments for their own sake. The three phases are represented in the statuary of both Aija and Huaraz, although examples of Phase 2 are by far the most nu merous. Unfortunately, good photographs of Phase 1 statues are not available. Because of the type of incision, the design detail can only be definitively established by tracings. Phase 3 is illustrated by the elaborately decorated statue of the Warrior type at Aija and by statues of Group A in Huaraz in which the angularization of the pose focuses attention on the play of contrasting diagonal and horizontal planes. Puma slabs represent two phases of carving. The Aija style and Huaraz Sub-Style 1 are analogous to Phase 2. Huaraz Sub-Style 2 and the Type IV puma slabs suggest a subsequent development in which the conservative position u u ^^ Fig. 72. Puma Types on Recuay Ceramics. was abandoned, and there was a free manipula tion of the compositional elements to achieve new symmetrically pleasing patterns. The puma itself became conventionalized with volute-type tail, angularly pointed ears, and angular jaw. The development in the carving of head tenons was probably in the direction of the diminishing importance of the head as a signifi cant adornment to the masonry. Sequence Correlation The earliest developments in the north high land stone sculpture are characterized by in tricate curvilinear designs executed with much greater skill than was lavished on the anthropo morphic block on which they were incised. This accounts for the deceptively crude appearance</page><page sequence="13">78 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 4 of some of the statues. The aesthetic conception is not unlike that which underlies Cupisnique art. The principle of combining a realistic statue with curvilinear designs also suggests the "bishop" of Moxeque. For these reasons I should assign statues of Phase 1 to a pre Recuay period, possibly contemporaneous with Salinar on the north coast in which curvilinear designs survive without the Chavinoid feline details. If more were known of White-on-Red at Huaraz, it should be possible to relate Phase 1 to it. This phase was followed by local develop ments in carving in the round in which the symbolic elements were reduced and supplanted by more realistic symbols such as the shield and trophy head and the genitals. This was also the period of local styles of puma slab carving in which the symbol of the pumas flanking a central figure was developed. Most of the statues in Aija and Huaraz repre sent this phase, and the full-face puma slabs with the profile pumas of Sub-Style 1 in Huaraz are also of this period. I should associate Phase 2 with the beginning of the Recuay period, contemporaneous with Gallinazo on the north coast. Finally, Phase 3 is represented by the profile pumas in the north and the Callejon de Huaylas with their definite associations with the Recuay ceramics. The anthropomorphic vase, previously cited, shows the warrior with a shield design of the double-headed serpent with ap pendages, a design which is most closely matched in the elaborate statue of the Warrior type in Aija which represents Phase 3. The rather wide distribution of Recuay ceramics both to the coast and to the north indicates that the Recuay period was one of considerable contact between the regions of the north high lands. Such contact may well have provided the stimulus for the third phase of stone sculpture which is characterized by the abandonment of the significant conventions of representation and a purely aesthetic interest in the juxtaposi tion and repetitious patterning of design ele ments, in contrasting planes, and in the de cisiveness of bold linear outlines. Subsequent developments in stone sculpture seem to have been confined to dressed stones and head tenons. The relationship of Chavin de Huantar stone sculpture to the north highland tradition should be noted in passing. The biomorphization of anatomical details, curvilinearity, and the dominant symmetrical composition are all characteristics of Chavin stone carving as well as the technique of fine line incision. These are also common to Phase 1. None of the statues of Phase 1, however, revealed any specifically Chavinoid motive. The closest parallels to the north highland puma slab at Chavin de Huantar is the figure No. 17 in Bennett's Chavin Stone Carving. This slab, however, is regarded as non-Chavin in style. The occurrence of human figures, which might also be cited as indicative of relationships to the north highland tradition, is also non Chavin. Whether this "non-Chavin" sculpture is post- or pre-Chavin, or simply another con temporaneous style, is a critical point to be determined before a relationship with other north highland stone sculpture can be estab lished. CONCLUSIONS The major conclusions reached as a result of this survey are: 1. The north highland tradition of stone sculpture con sists of (a) statues of human figures in sitting position with the legs drawn up, (b) the puma slab, and (c) heads and head tenons. 2. Huaraz was either the center of aesthetic develop ments in stone sculpture or, more probably, was the recipient of influences from other areas as far north as Cabana, as far east as Huantar, and as far west as Aija. These are reflected typically in the statues, puma slabs, and less frequently, heads and head tenons. 3. Aija represents a smaller center of stone sculpture in which a local style was developed in statues, puma slabs, and heads. 4. Huantar represents, so far as is known, another small and relatively isolated center of stone sculpture, although only statues have so far been reported. 5. Santiago de Chuco and Cabana represent what are probably northern variants of the general north highland tradition, and here the evidence is based upon the puma slabs principally. 6. The extent of north highland stone sculpture is shown by the reports of isolated finds as far north as Catan, as far east as Tiny ash, with nothing so far reported from areas immediately to the south of Huaraz. 7. The non-Chavin sculpture at Chavin de Huantar is the only material at that site which relates to the north highland tradition. 8. Specific association of all the varieties of stone sculp ture can be posited for the Recuay period, with heads and head tenons associated with the succeeding Katak and Wilkawain-Tiahuanaco periods. 9. An aesthetic analysis of the statuary into three phases, the last two correlated with the early and late Recuay period, makes probable the assignment of some statues in Phase 1 to a pre-Recuay phase, possibly White on-Red.</page><page sequence="14">schaedel] A REAPPRAISAL OF PERUVIAN ARCHAEOLOGY 79 10. No Recuay influence is noted in the region east of Huaraz at Chacas, Huantar, or Chavin de Huantar. The stone sculpture in this region, except for Classic Chavin, is not linked with any archeological sequence. There are many other points that should he touched upon, most of them in the category of hypothetical conjectures. The relationship of the north highland sculpture to central coast textiles, to Tiahuanaco, Pucara, and Huari (Ayacucho), not to mention Manabi and San Agustin, are all subjects worthy of discussion. The gaps in our information on sites to the east and north of the Callejon de Huaylas need to be filled before we will have an adequate basis upon which to generalize.
