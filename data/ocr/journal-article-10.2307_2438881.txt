<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FORM AND FUNCTION OF NUMERAL PATTERNS IN FLOWERS' E. E. Leppik SOME OF the basic structural designs in the various flower types are the numeral combinations of flower parts. Regular forms of di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, octo-, deca-, dodeca-, and polymerous symmetry make flowers look clearly different even when they have the same color and size (fig. 1). For certain plant groups, definite numbers of flower parts are so distinctive that taxonomists readily use them as constant characteristics for identification of species, genera, and frequently even larger taxonomic units. Besides, these symmet- rical figures of flowers have undoubtedly played an important role in the development of human art and architecture. The cardinal figures of trefoils, quatrefoils, cinquefoils, sixfoils, dixfoils, etc. in numerous folk ornaments, and particularly in Gothic architecture, are very close imitations of the above listed numeral combinations of flowers and of plant leaves. In most cases, the number of flower parts is con- stant for all individuals of the same species, genus, or family. But no definite parallels can be drawn between the occurrence of numeral combinations in flowers and the phylogenetic sequence of their bearers. Although many plant groups have the same number of flower parts, these numbers cannot be used for indication of the genetic relationship between taxonomic units beyond species. For in- stance, all Compositae have pentamerous, and all Cruciferae have tetramerous flowers, but these num- bers occur frequently also among Ranunculaceae, Labiatae, Rosaceae, etc., without a claim for priori- ty by any one of these families. On the contrary, a proper correlation exists in the development of numeral combinations in the showy flowers and the hologenetic series of flower- ing plants, as described and discussed below. According to the outlined theory here, definite 1 Received for publication September 20, 1955. The author is much indebted to Dr. L. M. Stavig, Presi- dent of Augustana College and member of the U. S. Com- mission for UNESCO, for his many-sided help in facilitating this study. Dr. Artistides Palacios, Director General, and Dr. Adolf Meyer-Abich, Scientific Counsellor of the Tropical Research Institute of the University of El Salvador in Cen- tral America aided me in solving many technical problems connected with field work in the tropics. Dr. Theodore Just, Chief Curator of the Chicago Natural History Museum, helped the author in a most cooperative spirit to discuss many problems connected with this work. Dr. Theodore Hornberger, Chairman of the Department of English of the University of Minnesota, was kind enough to read over my manuscript and make some stylistic correc- tions. Professor Theodore Hong assisted me in the prepara- tion of the manuscript. numeral combinations, such as three, four, five, six, ten, and so on, have gradually been evolved in the flowers of entomophilous plants from some indefi- nite, polymerous types under the selective activity of certain insect pollinators (fig. 3). As a matter of fact, bees and butterflies and some other insects have been found able to distinguish such numeral patterns in flowers (Leppik,. 1948a, 1953, 1955d), whereas the selective activity of pollinators is well demonstrated and generally recognized by students of floral ecology (Lovell, 1918; Grant, 1951; etc.). Field observations showed that specialized polli- nators have a prevalent habit and tendency to select for their permanent visits the varieties and ecotypes of flowers which they have found to be better sources of food, and whose characteristics such as color, form, size and numeral pattern, they can easily remember and recognize during their subse- quent trips. The training experiments with honey- bees confirmed these observations. Such continuous and instinctive selection of flowers by insects must necessarily have an important consequence for the evolution of flowering plants (Leppik, 1948a, 1955b; Butler, 1954, p. 6-10). Since polymerous flower types are prevalent in the phylogenetically older groups of angiosperms, the selection of definite numeral combinations such as four, five, three, ten, and so on, has been carried on by insects, very likely simultaneously in many plant groups which may not necessarily be related genetically. A similar case of convergency is ob- servable in the development of colors and size of flowers. One decisive factor in the differentiation of flower types, according to this hypothesis, is the in- creasing ability of certain insect pollinators to dis- tinguish color, form, and numeral patterns in flowers. The evolutionary trend of flower types is therefore a hologenetic one rather than phylogene- tic, in a sense as described and discussed in other papers (Leppik, 1948a, b, 1955 a, b), A further peculiarity of the above mentioned numeral combinations in flowers is that they are arranged in symmetrical figures, as pictured in fig. 1, and could be called therefore "figure numerals," to distinguish them from ordinary num- bers. In some former papers they are called also "form ujimerals" - (Leppik, 1955c), "Zahlensym- bole" (Bolle, 1954, p. 712), "nuimeros figurados" (Leppik, 1954). It deserves to be noticed that such "figure numerals," in spite of their simplicity and usefulness to symbolize and memorize definite amounts of objects or units, are not found in any known human pictograms or hieroglyphics, except [The Journal for June (43: 389-444) was issued June 30, 1956] AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY, Vol. 43, No. 7, July, 1956 445</page><page sequence="2">446 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 43 in folk ornaments (see above). Despite their wide distribution in nature, the origin and real function of "figure numerals" remained until recently ob- scure to man, as likewise the mystery of colored flowers (see Leppik, 1955a, p. 46-47). It is obvious that these "numerals" have evolved in flowers without human implication long before man came into existence, and their origin and true meaning should not be interpreted therefore in the anthropomorphic sense of the word. The complete system of "figure numerals" is nonetheless a real and directly observable order of concrete things in nature, which I have attempted to define and describe as such in this paper. "Figure numerals" can be defined as certain amounts of objects or units arranged symmetrically so that they can be quickly distinguished from one another and easily memorized according to their definite form. A figure for four is, for instance, a symmetrical cross of four units (commonly petals, sepals, or colored upper leaves; examples: flowers of Cruciferae, Philadelphus, Cornus florida, and many others). Five is a pentagon, three a triangle, .six a hexagon or a double triangle, eight a double cross in two colors, ten a double pentagon, twelve a double hexagon, and so on (fig. 1). Such simple patterns can easily be distinguished from one another and memorized mechanically, without the ability to count or calculate, even by organisms with a very low level of intelligence such as the in- sects. No wonder, therefore, that most nectar-seek- ing insects are conditioned to these numeral pat- terns in flowers, remembering them as definite characteristics of their food plants. Special tests and field observations have proved that some higher groups of pollinators, like honey- bees, bumblebees, and butterflies, are able to distinguish "figure numerals" as definite patterns from one another. These insects are further con- ditioned to associate these figures with definite quantity and quality of nectar and pollen. Experi- ments have been carried on so far with tri-, tetra-, hexa-, and polymerous flower types and also with artificial patterns, which imitated some flower types (Leppik, 1948, 1954, 1955a, b, c; Werth, 1949). It would be appropriate to point in this place also to the experiments carried out by Frisch (1914) and Herz (1929) with artificial patterns. Both behaviorists trained honeybees to select a gentian- shaped pattern (four petals) from a sunflower- type (many ray flowers), but could not train them to distinguish between geometrical triangles, squares, and circles. Evidently bees can associate numbers- with definite figures, which they can easily perceive and memorize. But they are not condi- tioned to distinguish geometrical figures in our meaning when these do not imitate some patterns previously familiar to them from flowers. There is substantial evidence that insects spot a flower as a whole, with all its characteristics such as form, color, number of flower parts (i. e., "figure numerals"), size, and frequently also by odor. Insects, however, are not looking for flowers for their beauty, but for the nectar and pollen which are hidden behind the showy part of blossoms. It is not the esthetic satisfaction that is the guiding factor for insects, but the simple experience that a better looking flower with perfect symmetry and harmonious colors is a more promising source of food. The presumable pan-esthetic sense of insects (Leppik, 1955b, p. 47) might be therefore, some- thing more rational than the human concept of beauty. According to this theory, every flower type serves as a certain "symbol" which insects can associate with quantity and quality of pollen and nectar. The term "symbol" is used in this paper in its gen- eral meaning as a visible sign of something invisi- ble, such as "symbols" for communication in the "sign language" of honeybees, and several analogi- cal "signs" in the "symbolic world" of insects and animals (see v. Frisch, 1954). FIGURE NUMERALS IN FLOWERS.-There are 13, possibly more, basic combinations of "figure numerals" in flowers and many specialized struc- tures, which can be derived from these basic forms. The basis combinations are: "simple" (amorphic), " many" (radial), "few," single, five radiate, five bilaterial, four, three radial, (three linear), two, six, eight, ten, and twelve (table 1, fig. 1). Varia- tions in size and color make it possible to derive from these basic forms hundreds of further com- binations, all clearly distinguishable from one another and all represented in flower types. But no seven, nine, eleven, and thirteen can be constantly found in flowers. Or if such numbers of petals or ray flowers exist occasionally, they do not occur in all individuals of the same species. These numbers cannot be arranged symmetrically, and honeybees were not conditioned to distinguish such combinations, either from one another or from flowers with many petals (Leppik, 1953). Flowers with seven, nine, eleven, and thirteen petals are apparently not genotypes, but rather accidental combinations among polypetalous individuals, spotted by insects obviously as "many." It should be noted here that Breder (1955), studying the pentagonal symmetry of marine ani- mals, established a similar numeral sequence for the shells and body structure of echinoderms, coe- lenterates, etc. (table 3, p. 203, 215). The num- bers 1, 29 3, 4, 5, 6, or multiples of these lower orders, e.g., 8, 10, 12, etc. are widely distributed, whereas 7, 9, 11, and 13 are rare or absent. Breder is right in asking (p. 215) "whether these varied and often unrelated organisms have 'selected' these numbers (in particular, 5) at random or whether there is an underlying biological or physical prin- ciple involved, which has guided such diverse things as dicotyledonous flowers, echinoderms, bees, and tetrapod appendages to settle on that definite number of parts."</page><page sequence="3">July, 1956] LEPPIK-NUMERAL PATTERNS IN FLOWERS 447 3.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~3 ,11 iA to v &lt; s 3&gt; r r 1 i _ m MANY FEW i Fig. 1-4.

They all can be derived from a more simple haplomorphic type of II level, the last one being evolved from the more generalized amorphic flowers. This derivation, however, is a natural one, and corresponds to the historical development of flower types (Leppik, 1954).

In still higher evolutionary level V the ""figure numerals" are frequently streamlined into zygo- morphic types of bilateral symmetry (fig. 4). Pentamerism of Compositae, Labiatae, Scrophu- lariaceae, trimerism of Orchidaceae, etc. reveal the origin of these types to be some combination of form numerals of the third or fourth levels. Thus five morphologically graded series can be observed among contemporaneous flower types as follows (table 1, fig. 3-4): I. Amorphic types (I in fig. 3-4) of primitive angiosperms are composed of more dense and dis- cblored involucral leaves without definite formn or symmetry, such as the pseudanthium of Dichromena ciliata (Leppik, 1955c). II. Haplomorphic flowers (II in fig. 3-4) of simple level contain many colored petals, arranged frequently in semispheric form, as in Magnolia, waterlily, etc. (fig. 5). III. Actinomorphic types (III in fig. 3-4) are characterized by radiate symmetry, while petals, sepals, stamens, and nectar deposits occur in flowers on the same level (fig. 6). These flowers do not require from their visitors a sense for third dimension. "Figure numerals" are clearly ex- pressed in these types. IV. Stereomorphic flowers (1, 2 in fig. 2; IV in fig. 4) with their protected nectar deposits are stretched toward a third dimension. "Figure numerals" are displayed in the front, but stamens and particularly nectar are hidden in the depth (fig. 2: 1, 2). V. Zygomorphic structures (3, 4 in fig. 2; V in fig. 4) with bilateral symmetry occur frequently in flowers of high evolutionary level, as pictured in fig. 2: 3, 4 and fig. 4, V level. These special struc- tures require normally from the pollinators of zygomorphic flowers a sense for third dimension, ability to distinguish forms of bilateral symmetry, and frequently also a special capability to operate some rather complicated mechanisms of pollination in flowers. Figure 7 shows a bumblebee (Bombus hortorum) opening a blossom of a snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) before pollination. Many other pollinators, including honeybees, are not able to operate this special mechanism of pollination. Several observable tendencies in the floral de- velopment of angiosperms show that the above- described successive series is the general trend of evolution of flowers, from amorphic to haplo- morphic, actinomorphic, stereomorphic, and zygo- morphic types (fig. 4). This perfect regularity in the development of "figure numerals" from one combination to another is clearly observable in the phylogenetic development and in classification of Ranunculaceae, Compositae, Liliaceae, Euphor- biaceae, and several other plant groups, as described in other papers (Leppik 1948a, b, 1955a, b). The above-described "figure numerals" repre- sent, consequently, a natural system which has its basic forms and derivatives, its beginning and its history of development fixed in the gradually evolving flower types (fig. 3). The whole series of "figure numerals" in flowers, although highly adaptable in its function, is ingenious for its sim- plicity. It has a fundamental importance for the typological classification of flowering plants (fig. 4). Composites with definite number of ray flowers. - Among tropical composites are several species with a constant number of ligulate flowers in a head, representing tri-, tetra-, penta-, and polymerous types of radiate level. In many cases these types have yellow color, equal size, similar radiate symmetry, and no distinguishable odors. They differ, however, sufficiently from one another by various TABLE 2.

This is a unique case of floral differentiation, demonstrating the formation of an imaginary flower fromn an inflorescence, and is therefore of particular importance for the present study. In the composites different combinations of "figure numerals" are formed not from ordinary petals, which have lost here their real function, but are evolved secondarily from the ray flowers of an anthodium, an inflores- cence which imitates a single flower. It would be extremely difficult to explain by these circum- stances why the number of ray flowers in an inflorescence is so constantly fixed to 3, 4, 5, 6 and "many" without taking the selectivity of insect pollinators into consideration. As could be expected, "steadfast" pollinators visited these composites apart from one another and distinguished them in special tests according to the different shape of the "figure numerals." This could be established most convincingly by observing the activity of the individually marked pollinators, as described below. "Steadfast" bees and butterflies visited for several consecutive days the same place, where- they have been previously marked (see table 4). The terms "steadfastness" and "constancy" of pollinators to certain flower types are used in this paper as follows: Constant pollinators are life- long and without choice bound with a single, few, or many plant species. Ernst Loew called them accordingly monotropic, oligotropic, and poly- tropic visitors. Steadfastness is suggested by Dr. H. M. Blegen for indication of a relatively newly established attitude of many higher pollinators in visiting after their own choice only one flower type at a time (Leppik, 1951, 1953, p. 230, footnote). Honeybees are according to this viewpoint oligo- tropic, because they are not bound with any special nectar plant. But they exhibit, nevertheless, a high rate of steadfastness to their previously chosen flower types, and so do many other pollinators. Steadfastness of honeybees and wild bees to the above mentioned tropical composites has been established also by analyzing the content of their pollen baskets. When bees were steadfast, their pollen loads contained pollen of the same species. Pollen grains of Mimosa, Dichromena, Compositae, and some further plant groups are easily dis- tinguishable under the microscope. Pollen loads of visitors to Melampodium divarigatum (many rays) could be distinguished from visitors to Baltimora recta (five rays) with the naked eye, according to intense yellow of the first and bright yellow color of the last one. Al- though both these plants grew closely together in the same community, most of the hymenopterous pollinators visited these flowers apart from one another. Sclerocarpus divaricatus has developed penta- merous type with relatively long floral tubes which are accessible to the long-tongued moths and butter- flies. Its pentamerous yellow flowers are distin- guishable from a distance. Honeybees, wild bees, and bumblebees never touched this plant. Some other plants, on the contrary, like Mimosa pudica and Dichromena ciliata, although accessible to all pollinators, have been visited by Apidae only (Leppik, 1955c). These tests and observations, discussed fully in other papers (Leppik, 1954, 1955a) convincingly demonstrate the marked ability of insect pollina- tors to distinguish "figure numerals," which in this case are not petals but are formed from the ray flowers of an inflorescence. The striking visual dis- similarity of these numeral patterns makes super- fluous a less reliable suggestion that these flowers might possess some distinguishable odor which might be insensible to man but perceptible to in- sects. Figure numerals and pollinating insects. - That the clearly distinguishable form and numeral pat- terns in flowers could have some meaning to polli- nating insects became evident to the writer after numerous field observations and some experiments concerning the selective activity of pollinators (Leppik, 1948a). There are always some flowers in the same plant community which have similar color and size and no odors but are, nevertheless, clearly distinguishable by their form or "figure numerals" (table 3). Steadfast pollinators commonly visit these types apart from one another (table 4; Leppik 1953, 1955b, c, d). Much evidence to support this idea was derived also from the modern behavior study of pollinating insects. The color sense of insects, their special ability of orientation among flowers, their percep- tion of form and patterns, are very definitely im- portant sensory mechanisms, which help their bearers in distinguishing. the symmmetrical patterns of "figure numerals." Referring to the original works of v. Frisch (1950, 1955), Ribbands (1953), Butler (1954) and others, only some few results concerning the sensory capabilities of pollinating insects can be cited here. A keen perception of form and patterns is well established in honeybees (Ribbands, 1953) and bumblebees (Kugler, 1942; Werth, 1949, and oth- ers.) A figural discrimination of patterns is so far evidenced in some groups of tropical butterflies (Leppik, 1954, 1955a) and stingless wild bees (Schwarz, 1948; Leppik, in press). One crucial point for the present study, how- ever, is whether or not insect pollinators are able to perceive the third dimension of numerous stereomorphic and zygomorphic flowers. Better studied in this respect are bumblebees, which, are known to possess a keen visual perception of form and depth (Kugler, 1943; Werth, 1949). These insects have a special liking for stereomorphic and</page><page sequence="6">450 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 43 TABLE 3.

Presumable, but not so well established, is the perception of the third dimension in honey- bees. Beside their form sense bees are frequently guided by special "nectar guides" in flowers, in which cases these insects would not need a visual orientation in the third dimension. Some tropical butterflies, tested by the writer, located nectar deposits in the long tubes of stereo- morphic flowers apparently by their tactile sense. True butterfly-fl-owers such as Dianthus, Lychnis, Phlox, Silene and others are characterized by a typical radial symmetry in front, and a long, nar- row corolla-tube, hidden behind the face. Such a floral structure requires from its pollinators first of all a sufficiently long proboscis rather than a visual perception of the third dimension. But there are also many butterfly-flowers among Liliaceae, Papilionaceae, Orchidaceae, Caprifoliaceae and other families whose zygomorphic floral structure points to the existence of a sense for form and third dimension in their visitors. The particular ability of butterflies to distinguish flowers with different sets of "figure numerals" is indicated in table 3. The discovery of an exact system of communica- tion, "the dance language of honeybees," indicates the high level of sensory development of these in- sects. The dancing of bees had been seen by early beekeepers and described by M. J. E. Spitzner in 1788 and by F. Dujardin in 1852. But these observations had been forgotten or variously inter- prete-d until proved and explained by v. Frisch in 1920 (Ribbands, 1953, p. 147-148). Whether or not insects can transmit information concerning "figure numerals" to each other, as honeybees com-municate direction, distances, and odor of nectar plants, is nrot yet known. There are some observations which indicate that social bees TABLE 4.

A bumbleZ bee (Bombus hortorum L.! in tlle center opens the flower. Right an opened flower with stamens in front. (Apis, Trigona, Melipona) might possess such ability in contrast to the solitary insects which do not practice such exchange of information. There is substantial evidence for assuming that insects cannot "learn" all their "dances," lan- guages," and "figure numerals" during their short life span, but these complicated sensory reflexes must have necessarily evolved during their long historical development. Nor does this complicated network of fine instincts and senses which enables insects to distinguish colors, odors, size, form and definite numeral patterns, exist without need and a specific adaptive function. With their delicate senses and instincts, which not infrequently even surpass the corresponding abilities of man, insects are accomplishing an extraordinarily important work in nature. In the continuous search for better food plants which are marked by more attractive colors and odors, these highly skilled pollinators carry on an important selective work among flow- ers. In the light of latest studies, the whole system of "figure numerals' in flowers might be considered as an end product of a very long and extensive selection in which pollinating insects had played not a minor role. There are many concrete examples and observable evolutionary tendencies among flowering plants, in which this selective activity of pollinators is well demonstrated (Lep- pik, 1955a, b, c). On the other hand, a permanent search for more satisfactory food plants among flowers must neces-</page><page sequence="8">452 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 43 sarily have stimulated the evolution of sensory mechanisms and behavioral capabilities of pol- linators. From the primitive level of distinguish- ing amorphic and haplomorphic flowers, insects presumably have developed their ability to rec- ognize radiate types with definite combinations of "figure numerals" in a sense as described elsewhere (Leppik, 1953, 1955d). Later on they might be- come conditioned to perceive the third dimension of stereomorphic flowers and could reach finally the highest stage in their sensory and behavioral development in recognizing the bilateral symmetry of zygomorphic flowers. According to this theory, definite levels in the evolution of flower types (table 1 and fig. 4) must necessarily reflect the corresponding stages of the sensory and behavior development of pollinating insects, as follows: I. In the primitive stage, insects have presumably located their food plants according to the char- acteristics of amorphic flowers, i.e., more dense and discolored upper leaves, or yellow stamens. II. The simple stage is characterized by the appearance of haplomorphic flowers, and a pre- sumed ability of pollinators to discriminate such forms and colors. III. The stage of two-dimensional symmetry in insects is accompanied by the development of vari- egated actinomorphic flower types. The figural dis- crimination by some advanced groups of insects is closely connected with radiate level of the floral development. IV. The ability of some groups of insects to distinguish the third dimension in stereomorphic flowers is a further presumptive stage in the develop- ment of the form sense of insects. V. The highest stage of the perception of bilateral symmetry of pollinating insects is reflected in the appearance of various zygomorphic flowers. There is, consequently, an observable parallelism between the typological classification of flowering plants and determinable abilities of insect pollina- tors to distinguish these types. How pollinating insects recognize their nectar and pollen plants. - Every living organism that possesses sense organs uses them primarily in the search for food. Insects developed their precisely coordinated senses for seeing, smelling recognizing numeral'patterns and forms of objects very likely earlier than other animals on land. Some sensory capabilities of present insects, as mentioned above, are more specialized than those of any other animals and frequently surpass the corresponding abilities of man. The main difference in this respect, however, be- tween insects and other seeing organisms is that animals ordinarily can see their food directly, which simplifies the search and catch, while insects cannot see the hidden nectar in flowers from a distance. It therefore became necessary for them to associate the nectar deposits and frequently also the covered pollen with some definite flower type or with some special characteristics, such as -color, symmetry, smell, shape, "figure numerals" and so on. This rather complicated food-searching activity must have stimulated the sensory development of early insects toward an ability to recognize and remember certain characteristics of their food plants as definite "trophosemeions" or "food marks," which we call flowers (see below). With the term semaphyll (sema, semeion; ,a a0;tov in Greek mean sign, mark) we wish to indicate in this paper all colored leaves of plants, like petals, sepals, bracts, ligulate flowers, etc., which serve to attract pollinators. A "trophoseme- ion" (trpopoa5 'ov) or "food mark" of insects is accordingly a coalescence of semaphylls, which is identical to but need not necessarily be a flower morphologically. Such "food marks" evolve frequently from the upper leaves, particularly when an anemophilous plant adapts itself to the insect pollination, as in the case of a tropical beak rush, D5chromena ciliata Vahl. (Leppik, 1955c). Some other plants have developed the necessary guiding marks for their visitors from the outer ring of functionless stamens (microsporophylls). Well known examples are the waterlily and some other genera of Nymphaeaceae. All these plants have formed the corolla obviously from staminoid petals, still having petaloid staminodia inside their flowers. The multitude of stamens and pistils indi- cates that these flowers might have been primarily pollinated by wind if not by water. Since the long peduncles of these flowers do not bear leaves, the outside stamens, which consequently have been con- verted by the progressive entomophily into func- tionless staminodia, finally could, have evolved into showy petals. Similar petal-like staminodia are found in Canna, Aizoaceae and many other plant groups, possibly as secondary developments after the degeneration of primary petals. The term "semaphyll" seems further appropriate to indicate two basic elements in the structure of angiosperm flowers: sporophylls (pistils and sta- mens) and semaphylls (showy parts of the flower, see table 2). Provided that pistils are megasporo- phylls and stamens microsporophylls, as many botanists accept, all semaphylls, including petaloid staminodia (see above), are strictly of phylloid origin. To the group of semaphylls should be in- cluded therefore all petals, colored sepals (in ordinary flowers), petaloid stamens, (in Nym- phaea, Canna, Aizoaceae, etc.), colored spathes (in Araceae), bracts (in some Cornus), white invo- lucres (in Dichromena), anthodioid inflorescences (in Compositae), clusters of flowers in Hydran- gea) and discolored uwpper leaves (in many Euphor- biaceae and Bougainvillaea). In spite of this most heterogenous material from which the trophoserne-</page><page sequence="9">July, 1956] LEPPIK--NUMERAL PAT'TERNS IN FLOWERS 453 ions have been molded, they all represent some definite signs or "symbols" of the above-described system. The whole system of "figure numerals" has been evolved, consequently, under the persistent selec- tion of pollinators, as a functional adaptation of semaphylls to the progressive development of the sensory mechanism of insects. One can see that the pollinating insects have developed, over a very long time, a perfect "alphabet" of signs and symbols, which includes even a definite system of "figure numerals." It is certain that the capability of pol- linators to "master" the above-described "alphabet" of their "food marks" is not a less important pre- requisite for their existence and welfare than the command of a "sign language" for their community life (see "the language of bees"). Pollinators, however, need an innate skill and a high level of sensory ability to "master" this varie- gated but principally simple system of tropho- semeions. Special tests and observations show that some groups of higher -pollinators, like bees, bum- blebees and butterflies, are well conditioned to this "alphabet," whereas some mentally less advanced insects are quite illiterate in this respect. Consequently, every entomophilous plant which has been exposed long enough to the selection of insect visitors bears, as a result of this selection, inside or outside of its true flowers, a definite "tro- phosemeion" or "food mark," which enables con- stant and steadfast pollinators to distinguish their food plants from one another. As a matter of fact, pollinators can associate these food marks with the quality, quantity, and place of nectar, pollen, or other edible parts of flowers, and to fly directly to the plants they knbw to be adequate sources of food. In this way they can save much time and energy, necessary for examination of every unknown flower, which may not contain food at all. Darwin was very likely one of the first to emphasize the economic aspect of constant flower visitors among bees. It is safe to say that even a very slight saving of time and energy by every single visit becomes, because of the enormous number of flowers to be visited, of great importance in the aggregate. The tiny savings of each single worker add up to a large deposit for the whole colony. The origin and specialization of flower types. -A recent view, derived from the above-mentioned discoveries of new abilities of insects and in particu- lar from the latest study in the field of floral ecology, is that the flowers and their pollinators are mutually interrelated as reciprocal selective factors in evolution. The parallels between the evolution of flower types and the development of behavioral abilities of insects to distinguish these types are too striking to be ignored (Leppik, 1948, 1955, b, c; Schneirla, 1951; Grant, 1951). In their permanent search for better sources of food, insects become unconscious carriers of pollen and important plant "breeders." Guided by inborn instincts, their many-sided selective activity is directed through numerous generations toward the goal of getting better nectar plants which are marked with more precise combinations of colors and symmetry. Analogical inherited instincts drive myriads of individuals of the same species into co-ordinated selective work resulting in the develop- ment of special flower types and trophosemeions as described above. Even if insects do not "breed" or "choose" con- sciously in the anthropomorphic sense of the word, their instinctive activities nevertheless result in a continuous "selection" among their food plants. On the level of innate reactivity to definite stimuli, one particular food type may release in an insect more, or more complete, responses than others, which condition may cause insects to "select" one definite flower type for its continuous visits. Besides, a flower visitor can always learn that some "food marks" are associated with better nectar supplies and are more easily accessible than others. The steadfastness and the constancy of pollinators are, therefore, most natural consequences of their selec- tive ability and activity. Remaining steadfast or constant to a definite species, they nevertheless can be selective among varieties and ecotypes of this species, provided that these varieties have some dis- tinguishable characteristics. In this food searching selection by insects ac- cording to their special symbols or trophosemeions, we have a very special mechanism of natural selec- tion among flowering plants, called tropheclexis in another paper-(Leppik 1955c). To a very large extent the biochemical composition of flowering plants has been determined by the tropheclectic activity of pollinating insects. Improvements have involved type and concentration of nectar and pol- len (for example, kinds and amounts of carbohy- drates and proteins), more complex compounds of pigments for flower color, and esters and oils for odors. The permanent selection by pollinating insects of better nectar plants possessing more in- tensive colors and more delicate fragrances led con- sequently to a gradual improvement in the biochemical composition of entomophilous plants. Differentiation of f lower types through the age of angiosperms.-The early pollinators very definitely did not meet in a Mesozoic landscape the multitude of flower types, which are displayed to present insects in recent floras. An intense yellow color of stamens, discolored and possibly involucrated upper leaves very likely helped early pollinators in the pre-Jurassic age to locate their food plants. Of particular importance must have been the differentiation of upper leaves, bracts or outer ring of stamens into special semaphylls, which served as "trophosemeions99 or "food marks" (see above) to the early'pollinators. This primi-</page><page sequence="10">454 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 43 tive stage of the floral development corresponds to the I evolutionary level in fig. 3 and 4. It does not, however, disagree with the strobiloid theory of primitive angiosperm flower, which is accepted now by many botanists. An analogous development of definite "food marks" from upper leaves (sema- phylls) takes place also when a wind-pollinated plant adapts itself secondarily to insect pollination. One of the best examples, the pseudanthium of Dichromena ciliata, is described in another paper (Leppik, 1955c). From the paleobotanical records we can learn that the oldest known angiosperms from the Jurassic rocks closely resemble the recent genera of water lilies, Castalia, Nelumbium, Magnolia, etc.- Flowers of these plants represent a simple haplomorphic type (fig. 5) of II evolutionary level (fig. 3, 4). Almost any actinomorphic flower of the next higher III, evolutionary level can be de- rived from this simple water lily type, as pictured in fig. 4. According to the present knowledge of floral evolution the haplomorphic type of recent water lily and Magnolfa must necessarily be a very close copy to the Jurassic and Cretaceous Magnolia flower. There are some important connecting links in the phylogenetic and hologenetic development of flowering plants, which enable one to recon- struct the ancient flower types and to correlate their evolution with the geological time table (see Leppik, 1955c). Stebbins, Camp, and Thomas (see Axelrod, 1952, p. 32), for instance, conclude from their considerations that angiosperms had attained their diversity of floral type (compare the radiate level III in fig. 4) by Jurassic time. Fur- ther indications are made by the wyiter elsewhere (Leppik, 1948, 1955c). Most phylogenists, however, today agree that angiosperms had a long history in pre-Jurassic time, long before their fossils appear in the paleon- tological records from Jurassic. Thomas (1947, p. 252) and Axelrod (1952, p. 30) suppose that the group as a whole could scarcely have originated at a more recent period than the end of the Paleozoic, i.e., approximately 60 million years before their dominance in the Cretaceous. The morphological evidence and arguments set forth in this paper suggest that these antique pre-Jurassic flowering plants bad an amorphic type of the primi- tive I level in their floral structure, as pictured in fig. 3, 4. SOME CONCLUSIONS.-Taking these facts and above discussed arguments, even though they are incomplete and fragmentary, under consideration, some general conclusions can be deduced. There is no doubt that the anemophily has been well es- tablished among gymnosperms in the Paleozoic, long before the beginning of insect pollination. The evidence seems to indicate that the first true pollinators have been segregated from the insect groups which devoured soft flower parts (stamens, pistils, ovaries) and pollen. There were, of course, no petals or sepals and no nectar deposits in those flowers, originally pollinated by wind. This was primarily a common type of one-sided parasitism, still largely exercised by many present groups of insects on recent vegetation. But as soon as some mentally more capable insects (the ancestors of Apidae might have been among them) specialized themselves to feed on flowers only and uncon- sciously started to carry pollen from one plant to another in their food searching trips, the parasitism turned to a mutually advantageous symbiosis (syn- agonism) between insects and plants. By this new combination a broad avenue was opened for the flowering plants to march off in a new direction in their evolution as a successive adaptation to the rapidly increasing sensory capabilities of certain insect pollinators. The further differentiation of flower types through the age of angiosperms is outlined according to this theory and described above. Five graded series of flower types (amorphic, haplomorphic, actino- morphic, stereomorphic and zygomorphic) corres- pond to the five levels of the sensory development in pollinating insects, to distinguish these types. There are many directly observable trends in the evolution of flower types and much indirect evidence to support this theory. The "figure numerals," as described above, are dominant motives in the differentiation of the ac- tinomorphic types of III level. They have a marked tendency to evolve into reduplicative forms in size and colors ("polyisomers" and "anisomers" of W. K. Gregory), forming hundreds of further com- binatior,3 all clearly distinctive from one another. Stereomorphic types of IV level have preserved all combinations of "figure numerals" in their front, forming various structures in the depth behind the face. These types are regular three-dimensional geometrical figures, stretched into depth. In the V evolutionary level, "figure numerals" are stream- lined into zygomorphic forms of bilateral sym- metry, losing their visual effect and being no longer of major importance for pollinators. They retained nonetheless their basic pattern even in the highest level, which fact enables us to recognize their origin and history of development (compare tubu- late florets of composites, five-part structure of Papilionaceae, Labiatae, Scrophulariaceae, and so on) . SUMMARY A natural system of "figure numerals,"' expressed in basic designs of flower types, is defined and described in this article. Many observations and several tests confirmed the assumed ability of higher specialized pollinating insects to distin- guish and memorize these "figure numerals." From the basic symbols of "figure numerals," such as pictured in fig. 1, hundreds of higher combinations can be derived, still clearly distinguishable to the insect eye (fig. 2, 4). The whole system of "figure</page><page sequence="11">July, 1-956] LEPPIK-NUMERAL PATTERNS IN FLOWERS 455 numerals" and their derivatives serve pollinators as special "food marks" or "trophosemeions," enabling them to fly directly to the plants they know to be adequate source of food. The de- ciphering of this system provides a new avenue to approach the problem of the evolution of flower types.
