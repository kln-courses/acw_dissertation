<plain_text><page sequence="1">Donald Maddox The Semiosis of Assimilatio in Medieval Models of Time In the twelfth book of De cintate Dei, Augustine refuted ancient theories which held that history is an endless progression of cycles. Against the image of a Plato who through countless cycles has at regular intervals taught the same disciples at the same Academy in the same Athens and so shall continue in the same progression through countless cycles yet to be, Augustine evokes the image of Christ, who, having died but once for our sins, shall live and die no more but shall instead remain with the Lord who caused time to begin and so will occasion its end (ch. 13; see also chs. 14-20). Not the least of Augustine's contributions to a theory of temporality was this vigorous expulsion of cyclicity from the concept of historical progression. 1 In place of a purely iterative his- toricity involving indeterminate repetition of identical cycles, Augustine set a biblically-informed conceptualization of salvation history, based on the doc- trine of non-repetition of the incarnation within a discrete-linear elaboration of time. After Augustine, the biblical temporal pattern, initiated by creation and fall and followed by specific providential moments before incarnation and ultimately the end of time itself, was to recur in a wide variety of contexts. Already for Augustine it pertained not only to the historical succession of civilizations but also to the spiritual status of the individual within the com- prehensive dimension of God's unfolding plan for mankind. From Orosius to Richer of St. Rémy, Honorius of Autun and Otto of Freising, the pattern is equally apparent in many works that depict imperial or national histories within the matrix of salvation history, or historia, as well as in countless hagiographie biographies that inscribe the exemplary life into the universal temporal design.2 Chenu has shown that the conceptual importance of historia became paramount during the twelfth century. Indicative of this tendency is Hugh of Saint Victor's widely influential treatise on learning, the Didascalicon, in which mastery of the comprehensive letter of Scripture as historia is depicted as the one indispensable prerequisite to all study in the arts as well as the sole foundation of higher knowledge, belief, and action (bk. 6, chs. 3-6). If, as Chenu maintains, the Didascalicon is but one of many works that reflect a "new awareness of history" during the twelfth century, it is nonetheless also true that Hugh's conceptualization of historia participates in a traditional contin- uum which harks unbroken back to Augustine and which will continue to serve until the later Middle Ages both as an epochal model and as a powerful semiotic armature for signifying a wide variety of sacred and secular content.3 252 Style: Volume 20, No. 2, Summer 1986</page><page sequence="2">Assimilatio in Medieval Models of Time 253 The discrete-linear model of time problematized by Augustine and rein- vested for centuries thereafter may be visualized as a single, autonomous text, one, moreover, which in its essence is an eschatological text, whose textuality elaborates a singulative progression through universal time, from creation to eschaton.4 Considered independently of any specific substance of content, such as the biblical content with which the Middle Ages frequently invested it, the eschatological text displays all the earmarks of a content form with a limited number of constant properties.5 The most prominent among these is the fact that the inchoative and terminal boundaries of the eschatological text delimit a finite field within which time and the narrative through which time finds expression are represented as being coterminous. There occurs within this field a formal bipartition which creates two homomorphic divisions of content, centered by a pivotal crisis. Thus, in the medieval ecclesiological investment of this form, the incarnation divides the Old Law from the New, relates ele- ments of each typologically, and occasions a crisis of consciousness as these two discrepant orders create conflicting patterns of belief and action.6 Further, in the medieval version, the linear succession of events is repeatedly marked by indices of a directly-governing transcendental order, as in visionary and prophetic utterances and miraculous occurrences. These reveal that God, as transcendental instigator of narrative events and their valuations, also insti- tutes a succession of historical agents, among whom figure Noah, Abraham, David, and eventually Christ, who function within a teleological succession of epochs.7 These periods are variously schematized by Augustine, Isidore of Seville, Bede, and a host of later commentators (Chenu 178-83; Smalley 27- 105). The historical agents no less than the prophetic and miraculous utterances all serve as evidence to affirm the operation of a divinely ordained eschatology. Paradoxically, however, the text's cumulative assertions of a transcendental presence are ultimately signified as being ineffable, unknowable, and ultimately absent from all forms of rational experience except that which is mediated or conditioned by the Word. And it is by the authority of the Word, finally, that the eschatological text signifies its textual closure as definitive, absolute, and irreversible, through figures of a transcendental sanction. As I have broadly characterized it here, the content form of the escha- tological text is by no means a system whose manifestations are confined exclusively to ecclesiological works of the Middle Ages. Both Frank Kermode and, more recently, Jurij Lotman have shown that the form is pertinent to many later types of texts, and Lotman has also argued that in the history of textuality the eschatological form, with its clearly delineated beginning and end, marks the earliest phase in the transition from endlessly repetitive "cycl- ical temporal" myths to "discrete-linear plot-texts" (Lotman 161-63; Kermode 3-31, 93-124). In a more abstract theoretical dimension, the so-called "can- onical" schéma narratif, which A. J. Greimas derives as a deductive model from Vladimir Propp's corpus of Russian folktales, and the related concept of</page><page sequence="3">254 Donald Maddox the récit mythique should not be identified as canonical models of "mythic" story, but rather as together comprising one of the more specific representations of the eschatological text as content form.8 With regard to its numerous historical manifestations, however, the es- chatological content form achieved dominance as an epochal model during the Middle Ages in a way unsurpassed in any prior or succeeding period.9 This is quite clearly because it was repeatedly invested with particularized versions of salvation history which, from the Septem Libri Historiarum contra Paganos of Orosius to much later works like the Imago Mundi of Honorius of Autun, sought to inscribe the temporal and geographical progression of successive empires- the translatio emperii- into the historical elaboration of the escha- tological text from creation to the writer's own age.10 Because of its prominence as the epochal modeling system of historia , the eschatological content form came to serve as a generalized paradigm of meaning production in medieval culture. Separated from its ecclesiological content, it provided a cognitive ma- trix for textual construction, one whose power to assimilate varieties of content remote from those traditionally associated with historia was ensured by its long and venerable service as the vehicle of universal history.11 Having served in the latter role to convey a message which was universally accepted through- out Christendom, its formal structure was therefore well suited to impart a meaningful overall configuration to a considerable variety of other messages as well. In short, the eschatological content form became an effective and versatile medium of medieval cultural communication, a medium which con- noted, for writer and public alike, the equivalence of signification and truth. Let us consider but one example. The exordia of twelfth-century verse romances frequently betray a keen awareness of the need to refashion the materia of sources according to a meaningful design, so that the organization of narrative ( conjointure ) will serve to disclose meaning (sens) (Kelly "Spé- cialité" and "Topical Invention"). While these prologues evoke an array of techniques acquired through formal training in the arts of the trivium, they also suggest that invention and topical amplification in discrete segments of text are in service to an objective which is essentially cognitive in nature. Superior mastery of poetic technique is not an end in itself, but rather the chief means of producing a meaning-effect- an apprehension of sens- through apprehension of the comprehensive dimension of textuality. There is evidence which indicates that these technically constructed narratives reflect a larger, culturally conditioned process of "building toward" a comprehensive textual design that is not specifically identified in manuals of composition. Ryding notes a general tendency to bipartition and interlace from Beowulf through the latter Middle Ages and suggests that "The bipartite form was not so much dictated by the subject matter as by prevailing modes of narrative organization. . . . The bipartite form was available and popular, and so [the poet] deliberately cast his material in this mold" (124). The problem with this view is that, apart</page><page sequence="4">Assimilatio in Medieval Models of Time 255 from the author of the thirteenth-century prose Suite du Merlin who explicitly uses bipartition to ensure against later corruptions, there is no evidence that bipartite form was explicitly "available" within the canons of a poetics of composition. Its cultural availability is nonetheless well illustrated by the many narratives whose comprehensive organization follows multipartite schemes that involve repetitive or variant adaptation of the eschatological content form.12 Peter Haidu's bipartite model based on duplication of the functions "Ap- proach," "Nexus," and "Crisis" effectively reveals how the content forms of some early French verse romances are caught up in a process of free adaptation and transformation within the constraints of the eschatological text as de- scribed above (see also Bruckner). In a complementary vein, Robert Hanning, dealing with the plot in early French verse romances as it relates to content, also discloses a tendency toward textual bipartition organized around a pivotal crisis. Moreover, Hanning evokes the affinities between this romance pattern and the eschatological content form.13 In the romances of Chrétien de Troyes, as I have shown elsewhere, this form is consistently operative, notably as it serves to contextualize the highly significant motif of awakening ("Awaken- ing"). All of this recent work affords evidence that these twelfth-century ro- mances variously adapt eschatological textuality. What has as yet remained virtually unrecognized, however, is the intergeneric dimension of such reman- ifestations, particularly with regard to the chansons de geste and the vernacular saint's life, along with its antecedents in hagiographie vitae. My work to date in these areas ("Figures romanesques" and "Form of Content") suggests that in instances where the eschatological content form is reinvested by early ver- nacular narratives of the Middle Ages, emphasis shifts from the closure-ori- ented teleology of historia to the crisis-oriented moment in the middle of the form. In these narratives, reorientation during crisis concerns not so much the moral dilemma created for collectivities confronted with an old and a new law and order, as in the ecclesiological eschatology of historia , but rather cognitive reassessment of prior experience on the part of a protagonist, be this the ex- emplary individual destined for sainthood, the eponymic warrior of epic, or the chivalric hero of romance. Teleology gives way to a psychology of crisis, as collective progression through time to the foretold closure of the eschaton is replaced by the individual caught up in an intense personal struggle to achieve a proper conceptualization of thought and action within the context of an open personal future. Whence the contrast between absolute closure in the eschatological text of historia and the partial closure or even openness in vernacular textualities that problematize individual transcendence of the piv- otal crisis. These circumstances would seem to foster the hypothesis that, during its tenure as the epochal model of universal time during the Middle Ages, the eschatological content form was invested by two related types of textuality,</page><page sequence="5">256 Donald Maddox each emanating from distinct cultural spheres. Within the normative sphere of medieval culture- that is, within the sphere which represents the epoch's cos- mogony and thus the foundations of its thoughts, beliefs, and conduct as en- coded in its laws, doctrines, and creeds- the eschatological text served to model the textuality of historia. Within the dynamic sphere of medieval culture- wherein the normative model is constantly subjected to ratification, alteration, or subversion through the pragmatic interaction of the institutions of culture- the eschatological text modeled what might well be identified as textualities of crisis. Given this hypothetical distinction between two spheres of medieval cul- ture, one organized by a normative eschatological textuality, the other com- prised of a plurality of textualities including the textualities of crisis, it is tempting to attribute regulatory dominance to the former and only a dependent subservience to the latter. Such readings are not uncommon in studies of medieval culture, and they have led to unnecessarily rigid and monolithic schemes which accord anteriority, priority, and sometimes absolute authority to ecclesiological determinants in the dynamics of textual production and trans- mission. Such is the case, for example, when interpreters of medieval secular texts, no matter how remote from any specific ecclesiological content, attempt to find within their discursive configurations the symbols of a transcendental theological meaning. Conditioned by the methodologies of patristic exegesis, this attitude is still apparent in many univocally "allegorical" readings ex- tended to medieval secular and vernacular works. Rather than posit such tran- scendental moorings for the normative sphere of medieval culture, so that all divergently related textualities within the dynamic sphere are taken to be either écarts from the "model" or else at least covert, if not overt, validations of its doctrinal content, a more satisfactory conceptualization of medieval textuality would acknowledge the two-way seminal interrelationship between the spheres, based on the potential for transformation of both form and content. In this light, we might begin to look for ways in which textualities of the dynamic sphere for many centuries either shaped or were shaped by the eschatological textuality of the central sphere without its ever being wholly displaced form its normative role in the medieval epochal frame. Let us consider one example of how the eschatological content form exercised a shaping function within the dynamic sphere, while at the same time undergoing an investment of new content that also reshaped it to some degree. We have seen how, in Augustine, the eschatological content form accedes to the status of epochal model through the expulsion of cyclical historicity. During the twelfth century, however, there developed a particularly acute awareness of a potential contradiction between the discrete linearity of uni- versal time and the evidence of cyclical periodicity in Nature. Although the latter had for centuries coexisted in popular culture, sometimes precariously, with a linear, eschatological conception of time, it did not become the focus</page><page sequence="6">Assimilatio in Medieval Models of Time 257 of intense ideational opposition until the twelfth century.14 Chenu has located the conflict in an opposition between the scholastic masters at Chartres and at the urban schools in general, who posited Nature as a "substantive reality . . . insensitive to the passage of time in human history," and the "historian- monks" for whom a scripturally founded concept of historia was the bedrock of clerical training. Yet Chenu also acknowledges that the two attitudes could coexist to some extent within the same intellectual context or even within the same individual (162-65, 199). Thus do we find Hugh of Saint Victor within a milieu that both ratifies the Augustinián view of salvation history and accommodates the cyclicity of Nature in a major way as it elaborates the mature liturgical calendar. On the one hand, Hugh is an ardently outspoken advocate of the eschatological text as the fundamental cognitive and ethical frame of reference. In the sixth book of the Didascalicon, it is the text of historia, the literal level of biblical discourse read in its totality, which provides the historical content indispensable to all learning. Only from this level may one accede to multiple interpretive readings at allegorical and tropological levels so as to determine correct thought and action in accordance with the divine plan for salvation (bk. 6, chs 3-6). In his treatise on the sacraments, De Sacramentis, salvation history is divided into three periods, following the division originally made by Saint Paul: from Adam to Moses is the period of natural law, from Moses to Christ the period of the written law, and from Christ to the end of the world the ultimate period of grace (312-13; sec. 1.8.11). For Hugh as for Augustine, linear periodization was irreconcilable with cyclical views of history held by the ancients (Chenu 178; In Eccles. hom. 144; sec. xix). On the other hand, cyclical temporality per se could become an asset to the linear designs of periodization, as it did for the Victorines. In a recent article, David Staines has shown how Hugh's Pauline structuration of salvation history was contemporaneously reflected in the elaboration of the liturgical calendar. Staines suggests that this tripartite configuration was expanded to four categories dividing salvation history first in the Victorine treatise, Spe- culum de Mysteriis Ecclesiae, initially attributed to Hugh of Saint Victor him- self, and then at the end of the twelfth century by the Parisian theologian Jean Beleth in his Rationale Divinorum Officiorum. It would appear that in these two late twelfth-century treatises application of a fourfold division of salvation history imposed, "for the first time," according to Staines, "a pattern that seemed to reveal the unity of the Church year" (154). I have found further evidence of the perdurability of this pattern in the prologue to the early four- teenth-century Legenda aurea, in which Jacobus de Voragine has retained the same categories according to the same divisions made by Jean Beleth. Con- sidered together, these three works disclose how the textual construction of the church year served as the locus for assimilation of cyclical forms of tem- porality to the normative eschatological textuality of historia.</page><page sequence="7">258 Donald Maddox In Figure 1 (see page 259) it is apparent that the Speculum Mysteriis Ecclesiae already follows the principle of homologation at work in the later two treatises, whereby a segment of salvation history is coordinated with a discrete segment of the liturgical year. This relation is further characterized by an isotopy, or semantic level of coherence, which is said to be pertinent both to the biblical period and to a portion of the church year. Thus in the first division identified in the Speculum , the period of salvation history from Adam to Moses is homologated with the time between Septuagésima and Easter, and these are related by the isotopy /death/. This principle remains operative throughout each of the three schemes. Each division is explained in a brief commentary similar to this one for the first division of the Speculum : From Septuagésima until Easter represents the time from Adam to Moses when death ruled. And therefore because the fall commemorated is contrary to justice, Gloria in excelsis Deo is silent. As an expression of peace there is heard, 'Fidelity springs up from earth and justice looks down from heaven' (Psalm 84). Because the punishment into which man fell through his fault is recalled by the spiritual readings, the Alleluia , the song of joy, is not heard. (348-49; sec. 4; cf. Staines 160 n. 36) The coordination of historical and liturgical moments is further explained by brief narrative evocations of scripture and specification of certain verbal and melodic practices in the liturgy. Of the utmost interest in the divisions by Jean Beleth and Jacobus de Voragine is the adjunction of new categories in each division. To the liturgical, historical, and semantic levels, Jean Beleth adds a seasonal level. Thus, in his first division, the period from Septuagésima to Easter homologates with winter as well as with the time from Adam to Moses and the isotopy /idolatry/, and all four levels are maintained throughout. In an even more elaborate ampli- fication, Jacobus de Voragine adds to Jean's four categories a fifth, diurnal category and a sixth, which specifies appropriate biblical books to be recited during the period of the year delineated by each division. In addition, both authors attempt to compensate for the absence from the fourfold division of the period between Christmas and Septuagésima (Beleth 63; sec. 56; Jacobus de Voragine prologue). This is accomplished by dividing the period into two parts, one from Christmas to the Octave of the Epiphany, another from the latter to Septuagésima. The former is homologated with the period from Easter to Pentecost, the time of "reconciliation," while the latter is homologated with the period from the Octave of the Epiphany to Septuagésima, the time of "pilgrimage." This augmentation allows the entire calendar to fit into the four- fold division (cf. Staines 156). It is noteworthy that in this progressive pro- jection of the church year onto the four periods of salvation history, it is only the latter which retains its linear continuity, while the cyclical church year is arranged in discontinuous divisions. Clearly the eschatological content form has retained its normative cultural status even as it has become progressively</page><page sequence="8">Assimilatio in Medieval Models of Time 259 e &lt;L&gt; &gt; TD O I- I S ^ &gt;5 £ &lt;D I .2 S ^ §&gt; 2 s S ^ w c ^ -è 2 W oj P ' ^ w to &amp; .22 , , £ aj ^ ^ ^ &lt;3 O W ÔJ • oj 8 £ P 'Ë ^ ' ^ SP fa O&amp;r^" &amp; .22 , , £ aj C G ^ o ^ &lt;^&gt; ^ ÔJ O T? &lt;&gt;5 c/5 t¿ ^ r-i fa O o &lt;D C G y, o ^ &lt;^&gt; a ^ 6 fa 5 O ï T?

Figure 2 (see page 26 1 ) shows how the most elaborate of these divisions, from the Legenda aurea, relates systems which are temporally linear, tem- porally cyclical, or thematic. One can see how the scheme of salvation history creates a continuous linear temporality onto which the discontinuous cyclical and thematically significant segments of the liturgical calendar are grafted. These are further related thematically by the series of anthropomorphic nar- rative functions "Erring," "Renewal," "Reconciliation," and "Pilgrimage." In addition to the thematic assortment of biblical texts, from Genesis to Isaias to Apocalypse to Kings and Maccabees, the set includes logical concatenation of the seasonal and diurnal cycles. In this progressive amplification of the church year, several different systems are thus being brought into a relationship of pertinence, despite the frequent absence of any intrinsic properties that would make them interrelate in a necessary fashion. Such arbitrary relationships as those suggested between seasons, days, biblical passages, time periods, and liturgical moments are none- theless confidently inscribed into an expandable context of successive hom- ologations in which necessity and divine ordination are implied. Whether it be in terms of adjunction of systems or of the prose commentaries that seek to justify them and to denote their incontrovertible necessity, this process of amplification by homologation of systems implies a belief that such writing is a reliable discovery procedure, a "writing toward" rediscovery of that plenitude of time always already inscribed in the contours of the eschatological text. The process reflected by these texts is an example of what the late Judson Boyce Allen discussed at considerable length in chapter 4, "Assimilalo and the Material of Poetry" and chapter 5, "The Assimilation of the Real World" of The Ethical Poetic of the Later Middle Ages in terms of the medieval sig- nifying practice of assimilatio (179-247, 248-87). Briefly, assimilatio designates "the medieval presumption that metaphoric structures are more than arbitrary linguistic or personal creations but rather reflect, or enact, something materially true of the universe." In medieval semiosis, referentiality is accorded full value and extends to the dimensions of entire "systems in parallel with other sys- tems" (182). Yet whether it be a relation of two systems or of an object and its description or of two separate entities, Allen maintains that "this structure of assimilatio exists ... at all levels of medieval reality" (206). By way of illustration, he cites the example of astrology, which systematically relates celestial phenomena and human behavior; he also evokes the widespread me- dieval practice of appending commentary to a text, and from theology, the complex assimilative levels of allegorical exegesis (206-29). With regard to the latter, Allen lists numerous conceptual advantages that the exegetical method offers for the criticism of medieval poetry. The identification of multiple levels of parallel systems affords a particularly me-</page><page sequence="10">Assimilatio in Medieval Models of Time 261 ~ c g&gt; it Q Ä I Z - ^ I 2 - ► z 1 - ► 1 w Q Ä Z 2 z w V in * u O U öß u a § c/3 .Sá U « öß ^ G £ &lt; "S c ► -C ► Ē ► S ^ ^ £ £ &lt; V •î I c ^ Si PQ S C s ^ ^ •§ ► ^ O s ^ ^ a g&gt; § g PQ S C ^ ^ •§ ► ^ O ^ ^ g&gt; s2 g M 43 Q •=: s2 M OÛ 43 ^ ^ ^ Q X ^ •=: ^ «*■ &lt; Q Z, w j u _ &lt; £ _ ts 7)2 &lt; 2 o W _ Cd Çd w O J .Sá ^ Ē o « 7j cb o C E â* I £ o i s ^ ^ u ^ DH ^ ^ ° '3 &amp;o ^ ^ ^ DH ^ ° Dí cd cd rj ¿ &lt;u G g H s cd &lt;D S cd ^ I rj S TS ¿ J s &lt;u Si H &lt;D cl ^ TS J 13 ^r¡ «S « 2 ^ /¿s &lt; ^r¡ J ^ c/3 &lt; W Oi &lt; î1 C Z .2 0 - Sa OJj l-H O OJj H w ld "H § u w g g) ^ ^ g ^ ^ g .S 5 &lt;L&gt; 'C ^ ^ C ^ ^ S Öß P X G &lt;u &lt;d tL. ^ W Od Od Olh Í1 Od O H c S .2 « 1 Ž?

The four ex- egetical levels presume "as a normative array of possible realities, a set of four which is at once arguably exhaustive and . . . well adapted to affirm the kinds of values poems tend to insist on: the world of empirical experience, the world of the self, the world of discursive or definitional generalization, and the es- chatological world, figurally achieved ' (215, emphasis mine). The exegetical perspective thus organizes, or seeks to organize, an encyclopedic homologation of levels, relating micro- and macrocosm and setting this hierarchical principle within the phenomenal continuum of universal history, which in turn assim- ilates to itself its comprehensive textual configuration in the Bible, its com- mentaries, and the sculptural and pictorial representations derived therefrom. With Allen's assimilation of exegesis to the doctrine of assimilatio we come full circle to Hugh of Saint Victor, who gave the exegetical method its most widely influential grounding in the eschatological text, yet who also in- itiated a movement that would make the liturgical calendar the basis for an assimilatio of linear and cyclical models of time. Such homologation of parallel systems is not confined to the Middle Ages. Rather, it is characteristic of many premodern cultures, as Pierre Guiraud has demonstrated (59-65). Guiraud shows how postulation of "an unverified analogy between two distinct series of phenomena" creates a "homo-analogy," while multiple series in homolo- gation are not uncommon in some cultures (63). Guiraud provides a table of homologations whose series include the Zodiac, the Tarot, geomancy, the hu- man body, colors, precious stones, metals, fingers, and numbers (64). Normally, according to Guiraud, one series is more stable and dominates the others, thus facilitating "an assimilation of the unknown to the known (and hence meaning) of the known" (6 1 , emphasis mine). He notes that "astrology serves as a homo- analogical code for other studies, because of all the phenomena of nature it constitutes the most rigorous and the most stable numerical, spatial and tem- poral system. Alchemy, medicine, physiognomy, psychology all borrow from astrology just as today linguistics, economics, and sociology seek their models in mathematics" (65). In terms of the medieval models of time involved in the elaboration of the church year, it is the normative textuality of the eschatological content form, as configured in the segmentation of historia, which serves as the stable homo-analogical series to which the other series are assimilated. In this way, they may become known again, not as autonomous series, but in terms of their participation in the comprehensive higher meaning of salvation history. The amplification of linear time by cyclical temporal systems in the calendrical treatises would seem thus far to reveal no profound destabilization of the eschatological text. It appears to serve, rather, as an example of full adherence to Hugh of Saint Victor's assertion, in the last book of the Didascalicon, that the eschatological text must ground all access to higher knowledge. Through assimilatio, the encounter between linear and cyclical temporality apparently</page><page sequence="12">Assimilatio in Medieval Models of Time 263 serves to disclose in a textually productive way both the elasticity and assim- ilative power of the eschatological content form and the potential cyclicity latent within it. Through the dynamics of assimilatio it gives the appearance of both shaping and being reshaped, yet without succumbing to the destabi- lizing and decentering potential of rival forms. Despite the appealing tidiness and uniformity of texture which asimilatio seems capable of layering over uneven surfaces, so that the flaws and fissures in the fusion seem to vanish, there remains a sense that something unresolved lies hidden beneath the veneer of the foregoing analysis. Closer inspection is called for. What, for example, does one make of the apparent arbitrariness with which the systems themselves are related in the mature model? Juxta- position of the linear continuity of historia with the seemingly awkward dis- continuity of the church year suggests that the eschatological form affords at best a procrustean accommodation of what is ostensibly the primary object of representation, that is, the annual cycle. Especially disconcerting is the fact that the eschatological time span is directly homologated with less than the entire church year, leaving out the period from Christmas to Septuagésima. To compensate for this, as we have seen, the latter period is divided into two parts which are homologated with two division already included among the first four. This is indeed a curious disposition of the calendar's elements and gives the appearance that a purely calendrical representation has been desta- bilized. If so, to what end? A closer look at the commentary in the Legenda aurea provided by Jacobus de Voragine suggests a possible answer. At the outset, it is a question neither of the divisions of the year nor of the stages of salvation history, but rather of the divisions in "this fugitive life": The whole of this fugitive life is divided into four periods: the period of erring, or wan- dering from the way; the period of renewal, or returning to the right way; the period of reconciliation; and the period of pilgrimage. (prologue, passim) Emphasis is on the four functions "Erring," "Renewal," "Reconciliation," and "Pilgrimage," and each of these functions is coordinated with its historical agent or agents: The period of erring began with Adam and lasted until Moses, for it was Adam who first turned from God's way. . . . The period of renewal began with Moses and lasted until the birth of Christ, for this is the period during which man was renewed and called back to the faith through the mouth of the prophets. . . . The period of reconciliation is that in which Christ, through the merits of His life and death, reconciled us with God the Father. . . . Finally, the period of pilgrimage is that of our present life, in which we wander as pilgrims amidst a thousand obstacles. (prologue) Here, in miniature, we find a narrative account of universal history down to the "present life," which is a life redolent of Augustine's earthly city, of wan-</page><page sequence="13">264 Donald Maddox dering as "pilgrims amidst a thousand obstacles." Not only is there a gap in the calendrical system; now we learn that the definitive closure of the escha- tological content form is de-emphasized in order to bring narrative time down to the crisis of mankind as it meanders through the middle of the model. True, during the third period, "Reconciliation," the Apocalpyse is to be read, because the "mystery" of Christ's reconciliation of man with God "is revealed therein in symbols and visions." This is as close as the text comes to the eschaton, which remains an unnameable "mystery" that yields forthwith to the fourth phase, the phase of our present wandering "amidst a thousand obstacles." In place of the period from Ascension to Last Judgment in Jean Beleth's scheme, this prologue substitutes the indeterminacy of "our present life."15 Two remarkable things happen at the beginning of this text. Both the discrete-linear plot of historia and the annual cycle are decentered, and this eccentricity results from homocentric inscription of the open textuality of cri- sis. Far from presenting a reassuring and orderly picture of teleology, the text speaks with uncertainty about a present beset by a thousand obstacles. Perhaps it is a matter of cognitive obstacles, for the phrase seems evocative of present uncertainty with regard to the "where," "when," "how", and "why" of the Millennium: "Where, when, how, and why is the beginning of the end?" The rigor of this homocentric reorganization of the model, in which linear and cyclical time are made accessory to the logic of mankind's open story, may be further demonstrated using the model of elementary signification, or "semiotic square." Used by Aristotle, Apuleius, medieval logicians, as well as by modern semioticians to measure minimal logical constraints, this model serves to locate a semantic term with respect to the terms to which it is logically related by opposition, contradiction, and implication.16 Thus in the model's uninvested framework, the term x is related by contradiction to not x, or x, by opposition to y, and is implied by y: '&gt;&lt;' y x x - y and y - x: relations of contrary terms xOx and y*-*y: relations of contradictory terms ý - ►x and x - ►y: relations of implication Concerning the selection of terms, Voragine's commentary accords priv- ilege to four main functions of human agency in salvation history, and when they are plotted onto the square, as in Figure 3 (see page 265), the logical relations among these functions are revealed as constitutive of certain selec- tions of coordinated terms in the homologated systems.</page><page sequence="14">Assimilatio in Medieval Models of Time 265 Initial: Terminal: 1.

Thence derive the contradictories x Rec- onciliation and ý Renewal. The terms x-x are contradictory in that, through the agency of Christ, Reconciliation binds a contract between God and man- kind that was initially abrogated by Adam's Erring. Moreover, the period from Adam to Moses spans the movement toward revelation of the Old Law just as that from Nativity to Ascension traces the movement toward disclosure of the New. Likewise, the Renewal figured by the period from Moses to Christ is typologically an antetype of the Pilgrimage from the present to the Second Coming of Christ which betokens the imminent end of time. The four narrative functions thus disclose an order of logical constraints founded on typology. By contrast, the pertinence of the four liturgical periods and the requisite biblical chapters for each are quite simply given by the com- mentary, as in this typical example from the commentary on division 1: And this first period is represented, in the Church, by the part of the year which runs from Septuagésima to Easter. During this part of the year the Book of Genesis is recited, this being the Book which contains the account of the sin of our first parents. (prologue) The function of liturgy in this scheme is an accessory one, which is to "rep- resent," in "symbolic" acts and biblical "recitations," the narrative phases in the etiology of mankind's present and the mystery of the prospective teleology that it confronts in this "fugitive life," whence a liturgical configuration of past, present, and future. The seasonal and diurnal series are plotted homol- ogously according to contradictory relations and degrees of darkness and light: Winter-Summer^Night-Noon Spring-Autumn- Morning-Evening Appropriately, Winter and Night connote the negative qualities of the Fall of Man, while Summer and Noon suggest the optimal qualities of Reconciliation with God through Christ. Spring and Morning aptly capture the mood of Renewal, while the crepuscular overtones of Autumn and Evening are certainly in harmony with the less than euphoric perplexity of the pilgrim whose Pil- grimage is beset by a thousand obstacles. In addition to the logic of typology created by the antagonism of cate- gories, a juridico-historical isotopy emerges from the coordination of paired categories. The axis of contraries created by the terms Erring and Pilgrimage is in effect the axis of salvation history to the present. Around this principal axis are situated discrete segments of that continuum. The deixis formed by x-y, Erring to Renewal, designates the axis of the Old Law, while the opposite deixis, y-x, Reconciliation to Pilgrimage, designates the New. Finally, the axis of subcontraries, ý-x, Renewal to Reconciliation designates the span of human</page><page sequence="16">Assimilatio in Medieval Models of Time 267 juridical history, from Moses to Christ. Read in terms of these coordinates, the commentary can be seen as a homologation of the three orders of medieval law, whereby both the natural law of the days and seasons and the mundane laws of mankind are homologated with divine law as revealed within salvation history. Having decentered both eschatology and liturgy in the first, homocentric part of the commentary, the commentator, following the example of Jean Beleth, then decenters this scheme in its turn, by declaring the reasons why the Church adheres in its liturgical practices to a different order of priorities. We learn that the liturgy begins its year with Advent, division 2, because it is a time of renewal when the Church "turns back to the beginning of her offices" and also because "by beginning with the time of the transgression, she would seem to begin with error." The text ends on a note of reassuring optimism: Therefore she does not hold strictly to the order of time, just as the Evangelists frequently do not follow it in their accounts of the life of the Lord. Then, too, with the advent of the Lord everything is renewed, and that is why this period is called the time of renewal. (prologue) Scriptural precedent authorizes liberties with linear time. So, too, does the Church forsake "the order of time," that order which binds man into its middle, so as to make the ambiguity of "this period" the "time of renewal." At the very end of the prologue, the aporia previously formed by the tension between open linearity and closed cyclicity yields so that the whole cycle recycles, and mankind in the Church can begin again. We might in conclusion recognize in Voragine's mature model of the liturgical year a text which accedes to the sublime, as Neil Hertz recently conceived of it. Evoking Kant's notion of the "mathematical sublime," Hertz remarks that a sense of the sublime arises "out of sheer cognitive exhaustion, the mind blocked not by the threat of an overwhelming force, but by the fear of losing count or of being reduced to nothing but counting- this and this and this- with no hope of bringing a long series or a vast scattering under some sort of conceptual unity." Yet the Kantian sublime entails not abject submis- sion to such blockage but rather "a compensatory positive movement, the mind's exultation in its ability to think a totality that cannot be taken in through the senses" (62). It is precisely this dual development of blockage and compensation which characterizes the voraginian sublime. Wandering Man- kind finds itself "amidst a thousand obstacles," reduced indeed to "nothing but counting," and left without hope of thus attaining an answer to the pro- spective question raised by the eschatological text. Yet this vexatious blockage is quickly camouflaged by the round of days and seasons and, finally, by a joyful evocation of cyclicity in the liturgical year. The cyclical systems that creep into the calendar are consoling accretions because, by cycling the wayfarer through a day, a season, or a year, only to</page><page sequence="17">268 Donald Maddox begin again, they compensate for the anguish and blockage inspired by the eschatological scheme and its attendant crisis of consciousness. Because cycl- icity offers a periodic means of cognitive access to dimensions seemingly as- similable to the mystery of futurity, the sublime may sidestep the unanswerable question that always lingers out there somewhere, poised between the obscure darkness before our origins and that one decisive dawn of this world's oblivion.

See also Ricoeur 19-53 for extended commentary on Augustine's theory of time.

On Richer of St. Rémy, see Nichols 1-13; on Honorius, see Flint. The morphology and temporal context of early hagiographie biography is analyzed in Elliott, esp. chs. 3-7. 3 On epochal models in historiography, see Campbell. 4 On literary examples of eschatological textuality from diverse cultures see Ker- mode and Lotman. 5 My distinction between form and substance of content derives from the con- ceptualization of expression and content formulated by Louis Hjelmslev. See the new French edition of his Prolégomènes 65-79. 6 Compare Daniélou: "... the Old Testament gave us an eschatological typology, while the Gospel shows how all has been fulfilled in Christ: St. Paul will show us its continual fulfillment in each Christian life" ( 1 9). Compare also Collingwood: "Christian history . . . will attach a central importance ... to the historical life of Christ. ... It will make its narrative crystallize itself round that event. ... It will therefore divide history at the birth of Christ into two parts, each having a peculiar and unique character of its own: the first, a forward-looking character, consisting in blind preparation for an event not yet revealed; the second a backward-looking character depending on the fact that the revelation has now been made" (50). In a similar vein, see Bultmann 58. 7 Collingwood states that in Christian history "the historical process is the working out not of man's purposes but of God's." Historical "agents" and "entities" are now seen as "vehicles of God's purposes" in an historical process involving a purposeful creation and destruction. This view overcomes the "particularism" of Greco-Roman history in that this process is universal, involving "not just one people but all equally in the sight of God" (48). 8 See Greimas, Du Sens 185-230, where the operative model (198) of the "récit mythique" displays precisely those properties which most adequately characterize the eschatological text: discrete-linearity, bipartition, and homologation of content in each of the two parts. Moreover, the "schéma narratif," which features the addressor ("des- tinateur") in the dual functions of manipulative inception of narrative ("destinateur- manipulateur") and agency of its sanction and closure ("destinateur-judicateur") well describes another important feature of the eschatological text.

On Marx, see also Campbell 233 n. 19. 10 On the translatio emperii, see Chenu 1 84-1 88: "After sacred history (from Adam to Christ) and ancient secular history (from the first empires to the Roman Empire), the era of the incarnation was thus divided: the first Roman emperors; from Trajan to Constantine; then, connecting with the Franks, from the origins of the Franks to Charles the Simple, and to the Normans" (184). This view of the translatio is set forth by Richard of Saint- Victor in the Exceptiones allegoricae , chapters 6-10 (239-84). See also the later chapters of Hanning, Vision of History. 11 With regard to the eschatological form, Lotman has commented on its adapt- ability, as plot, to widely differing types of content: "Like every language, the language of plot can only transmit and model a certain content by being separated from that content. The models which arose in ancient times are separated from specific messages, but can serve as the material for their textual construction. ... By creating plot texts, man learnt to distinguish plots in life and thus to make sense of life" (183). 12 See Maddox, "Trois sur deux" 91-102; on the Suite du Merlin , see 94. 13 "The Christian story, embodied in a special reading of the Old Testament in the light of the New, is a complex version of the golden age myth with various stages marked on the path toward regaining at the end of time (the eschaton) the golden age lost at its beginning: chosen people, redemption, final resurrection, and universal judg- ment. Human experience here is fundamentally linear- God entered history only once, and gave it irreversible meaning- yet the form of history is that of loss and recovery of intimacy with the Creator This pattern is recapitulated in each life. . . ." Whence an emphasis on the "individual, biographical" dimension of the pattern in romance {Individual 199-200; see further 194-233). 14 Indeed, a survey of popular eschatology during the Middle Ages shows how readily the popular imagination, accustomed as it was to the cyclical rhythms of nature, was nonetheless highly susceptible to millennial and apocalyptic predictions.
