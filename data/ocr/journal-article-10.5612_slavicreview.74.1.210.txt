This monograph off ers a new and original interpretation of Marc Chagall’s art by fo- cusing on the interaction of image and text in his book illustrations. By anchoring  Chagall’s art in Yiddish, Russian, and European cultural contexts, Sabine Koller ar- gues that he can be productively understood as a precursor of the “iconic turn,” a new  interdisciplinary approach to the interpretation of visual imagery which has emerged  in German-language scholarship in the past twenty years from the poststructural- ist critique of the traditional division between the visual and the textual. Although  Koller describes Chagall as “an artist who was notoriously hostile to theory” (54), she  argues that it was in his praxis—in both painting and autobiographical writing—that  he developed and implemented ideas similar to the contemporary conceptualization  of intermediality. Koller investigates Chagall’s artistic practices from two diff erent perspectives.  On the one hand, she off ers an insightful close reading of Chagall’s early book il- lustrations in the multicultural context of his time. On the other hand, she proposes  a strikingly original way of using the semiotics of his imagery as a key to open up  poetic texts’ deeper meanings, going beyond the conventional discursive linear read- ing. While both approaches are closely intertwined in her book, it is the latter that  holds great promise for understanding the relationships between text and image and  makes this study an important contribution not only to the fi elds of Slavic and Jewish  studies but also to the theory of intermediality. This nondiscursive way of reading poetry by setting texts and images as “equally  signifi cant artifacts” (20) helps expose metaphorical and symbolic structures yield- ing meanings that remain otherwise inaccessible for a conventional, linear reading.  Viewing and reading thus become two indispensable acts in the text-image complex’s  reception. Expanding on Wolfgang Iser’s theory of reception, Koller interprets the  inherent intertextuality of poetic text and visual image as the “dialectical diff erence  of presence and absence” (26). And it is Chagall’s art that presents the most suitable  case study for an investigation of this dialectical complexity. The fi rst part of the book traces the emergence of that specifi c “intermedial” sym- bolic language as part of the Jewish cultural renaissance in eastern Europe around  World War I. Koller uses Chagall’s autobiography as an entry point into this highly  original artistic realm. By analyzing the linguistic diff erences between its Yiddish  (1925) and French (1931) versions, Koller uncovers two diff erent modes of Chagall’s  self-representations—as a Jewish and a European artist. The dialectical interplay of  these “literary enactments” (53) of Chagall’s self-image corresponds to the visual am- bivalence in his self-portraits. </page> <page sequence="2"> Book Reviews 211 Moving on to Chagall’s fi gurative anthropomorphic representations of real- ity, Koller investigates his color-based “rhetoric of painting,” which is rooted in the  subjectivity of his “enacted self” (59). An emphasis on subjectivity, which marks  Chagall’s early period, was also a defi ning feature of the new generation of Yiddish  modernist and avant-garde poets who entered the literary stage in the wake of WWI.  By exploring the Yiddish cultural context, Koller examines the literary and linguistic  foundations of Chagall’s visual language. The close links between Jewish folklore  and Chagall’s imagery have, of course, been studied by a number of critics and schol- ars, most recently by Benjamin Harshav, but Koller takes this approach a step further  by conceptualizing the relationship as a way of “transforming Yiddish semantics into  aesthetics” (96), which was part of Chagall’s “double coup” in international avant- garde and national Jewish art. The central part of the book deals with textual and visual representations of  violence and death in Jewish literature and visual arts in the wake of WWI and the  Russian revolution and civil war. This moment marks Chagall’s radical break with  the fi gurative mode that had been prevalent in prewar Jewish art. He developed a  strikingly new metaphorical language in close interaction with contemporary Yid- dish and Hebrew poets, particularly the Kiev group of Yiddish poets (Perets Markish,  Dovid Hofshtein, Leib Kvitko). In the same way, as Koller demonstrates by analyzing  Kvitko’s collection of pogrom poetry, 1919 (1923), the young Yiddish poetry acquired  a new “originality and power of linguistic imagery” (119) by adopting a new poetics  of visuality. The third part of the book explores the aft erlife of intermediality and  intertextuality in Chagall’s works of the later period, when the immediate shock of  violence gave way to its memorialization. Koller makes a forceful argument for a radical revision of the conventional un- derstanding of both the east European avant-garde in general and the Jewish cultural  renaissance in particular. An English translation of her book would be an invaluable  contribution to the ongoing conversation around these issues. Mikhail Krutikov University of Michigan Fairy Tales and True Stories: The History of Russian Literature for Children  and Young People (1574–2010). By Ben Hellman. Russian History and Culture,  vol. 13. Leiden: Brill, 2013. xi, 588 pp. Bibliography. Index. Illustrations. $199.00,  hard bound. This study is an encyclopedic, historically minded overview of Russian, Soviet, and  post-Soviet children’s literature during the course of over fi ve centuries. While the  analysis and descriptions strengthen and deepen as the modern era approaches and  slow down as the Soviet Union collapses, the volume manages to provide its read- ers with a substantive sense of the transformation of children’s literature from the   seventeenth century to the start of the twenty-fi rst. Fairy Tales and True Stories in- cludes descriptions of stories, novellas, poems, translations, humor writing, lulla- bies, plays, and more. Ben Hellman casts his net very widely, if not always especially  deeply. Organized strictly chronologically, the fi rst third of the book introduces the  reader to the history of young people’s reading up until the end of the nineteenth  century (chapters 1–4), getting more detailed with each subsequent era. These early  chapters read like a comprehensive listing of children’s literature publications rather  than a sustained analysis of content and its relationship to political ideologies, social  </page> </plain_text>
