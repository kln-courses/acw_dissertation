These studies have proven so successful that a recent com- panion to the Homeric poems can describe the DA straightfor- wardly as 'an Oriental episode',4 while Richard Janko's excellent volume in the Cambridge Iliad commentary constantly invokes Near Eastern material to assist the reader's interpretations of the narrative.5 This article proposes to argue the opposite case, but not by of- fering a radically new interpretation of the DA, for it is already the beneficiary of several extremely useful treatments.6 Instead, I shall proceed by subjecting to detailed scrutiny the arguments behind the consensus view of an 'oriental' DA. I hasten to add that the pur- pose of this project is not to deny the utility of the Near Eastern material, the lasting value of which has been established by Walter Burkert and Martin West above all, but to incline the balance back towards the Greek side of the equation.7 Before engaging with the individual treatments and their ar- guments, it might be helpful to offer a brief characterisation of the orientalising methods we shall encounter. The first, relatively un- controversial, step is the identification of parallels, though this is not without its perils, given that similarities can be overplayed. Of course, in order to suggest Greek textual or cultural dependence on the ancient Near East, it is not enough simply to point out similar- ities.8 To rule out the possibility that the parallel is the result of co- incidence or an independent use of the same material, orientalists deploy two tools: (1) the argument by isolation, and (2) the argu- ment by association. The first of these seeks to separate the feature from its Greek context, showing that it is unusual, defective or 4) S. Morris, Homer and the Near East, in: I. Morris and B. B. Powell (eds.), A New Companion to Homer (Leiden 1997) 599-623: 602; cf. also Faraone (as n. 3) 202: "an episode which betrays several hallmarks of direct Near Eastern influence." 5) Ct., e.g., Janko (as n.2) ad II. 14.200-7, 181-2; ad 15.183-97, 247. 6) Cf., e. g., the works cited above, n. 2. It is, of course, to be hoped that some new insights on the DA will be offered during the course of the article, but that con- clusion is the reader's. 7) For much the same purpose, cf., e. g., G. W. Most, Hesiod's myth of the five (or three or four) races, PCPhS 43 (1997) 104-27; J. Haubold, Greek epic: a Near Eastern genre? PCPhS 48 (2002) 1-19. 8) Cf., however, below, pp. 292 f., 301 f., for the attitude of West (as n. 3).</page><page sequence="3">9) These methods were of course inherited from earlier schools of Homer- ic scholarship, specifically the Analysts and Neoanalysts, both of whom look for inconsistencies or difficulties in the Homeric text, link them together, and argue either for Homer's dependence on older epics (Neoanalysts) or that the poems are a patchwork of different texts and authors (Analysts). 10) Cf. below, pp. 292 f., 301 f., for the differences between 'hard' and 'soft' versions of the methodology. 1 1) Of the works already cited (above, n. 3), I refer here to Burkert 1983, 53- 4; 1984, 87-92-1992, 89-6; 2003, 36-42 = 2004, 29-37. The last two (the first in German, the second in English) were originally published in Italian (1999), French (2001) and Spanish (2002); I have limited the citations to the English and German editions for reasons of space. 12) Cf., e. g., S. Dalley, Myths from Mesopotamia: Creation, the Flood, Gil- gamesh, and others (Oxford 1989) 36 n.4, referring to Burkert 1983 (as n.3). His conclusions have even found their way into Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Deception_of_Zeus) and have profoundly influenced public (mis)understand- ings of this issue; cf., e. g., R. Schrott, Der Kampf um Troja und seine realen Hin- tereründe CMunich 2008Ì. 13) I structure my argument in accordance with his first two treatments, viz. Burkert 1 983 and 1 984 - 1 992 (all as n. 3), discussing the divine lot (section 1 below) directly before the 'cosmogonie' Okeanos (section 2) and its supplementary paral- lels (section 3). Burkert 2003 = 2004 (as n. 3) reverses the order of the two main mo- tifs, without substantive alterations to his thesis. The Babylonian Captivity of Homer 261 unique - something other than that which is to be expected in the text under examination. The second argument is a cumulative one; once one feature has been sufficiently isolated so as to bolster the likelihood of its derived status, other features in its vicinity can be linked with it. Thus, the number and localisation of derived fea- tures in any episode make it more likely that the poet was under the influence of his source text.9 Not all orientalists proceed on this or, indeed, the same basis as one another,10 but the description re- flects the methodologies shown in the authoritative treatments of the DA with which this article is concerned. The most significant of these is without doubt the work of Walter Burkert, whose foundational discussions have been reprint- ed and reworked on a number of occasions,11 and have become so standard that they are cited even outside the confines of classical scholarship.12 Because he structures his case so succinctly, and con- stantly uses the argument by association to link each of his points, my response will mirror the course of his discussion fairly closely, adducing the opinions of other scholars only when they augment or vary his central presentation.13 To that end, this article is sepa- rated into four sections. The first two deal with the two most im-</page><page sequence="4">262 Adrian Kelly portant motifs for Burkerťs case, the third with his supplementary parallels, and the fourth with several additional features pointed out by Martin West. 1. Poseidon's Triple lot and the Atrahasis epic Burkerťs first major motif consists of the similarities between Poseidon's reference to a threefold division of the earth (II. 15.187- 93) and the beginning of Atrahasis (OBV 1.1.11-16; с 17th с.

Struck, and not unreasonably, by the resemblances between these passages, Burkert concludes: [t]here is hardly another passage in Homer which comes so close to be- ing a translation of an Akkadian epic. Actually, it is not really a trans- lation but a resetting, yet in a way that shows the foreign framework.15 In other words, the poet of the Iliad himself, or at best a recent predecessor, has reworked this passage from Atrahasis, and in such a way that it doesn't really fit with its Greek context. On the other hand, there is other early Greek evidence for this tra- dition of a triple lot,16 so one could argue that the idea was typ- 14) Atrahasis is quoted from the translation of Dalley (as n. 12). 15) Burkert 2004, 37 (= 2003, 42); 1983, 53 ~ 1984, 87 (= 1992, 91) (all as n. 3). 16) Cf.

Nonetheless, however tempt- ing, it would be unwise to rely on these (mostly much) later ref- erences, for there is at least some chance that they may all stem back to Poseidon's speech. One can therefore begin by questioning the strength of the parallel, and the desirability of linking the two texts as directly as Burkert does: (a) the lot in Homer is between brothers, and not cross-generational as in Atrahasis;17 (b) the Homeric passage di- ccůávccToi, / (pavepocv èv neXáyei ePó8ov e^iev ttovtÍcoi, / ¿сАдороц Ô' év ßevtfeaiv vaaov кекргкрдои. / àrceóvxoç ô' ouxiç evôei^ev A,axoç АеАло')- / Kai pá viv x^paç aKÀxxpcoTov Xinov, I áyvòv ůeóv. / iivaadévxi ôè Ze')ç a'inaXov 'iéXXev òí'izv. àXXá viv огж eïaaev).

West (as n.3) 110: "[t]hese myths reflect actual use of the lot in the Near East to allocate shares of a man's estate to his sons, shares of temple income to different officials, or generally 'to establish a sequence among persons of equal status that would be acceptable, as divinely ordained, to all participants'" (citing A.L.Oppenheim, Ancient Mesopotamia [Chicago 1977] 208). For fuller examina- tions, cf. P. Steinkeller, Communications, Revue d'Assyrologie et d'archéologie orientale 78 (1984) 83-8, at 86 and (for later periods) W. Hallo, The first Purim, Biblical Archaeologist 46 (1983) 19-29; also J.Lindblom, Lot-Casting in the Old Testament, Vetus Testamentům 12 (1962) 164-178 on the motif in the Hebrew bible. The fact that the Greek lot is between brothers would seem to reflect 'actual use' much more closely than the intergenerational lot in Atrahasis , weakening further the conclusion that Homer derived it from the Near Eastern text.</page><page sequence="6">264 Adrian Kelly vides the universe into four areas, not three,18 with (c) a neutral area entirely foreign to the conception of both Atrahasis and the other Near Eastern texts which show this division,19 and (d) a threefold division is also found in the Indo-European tradition.20 The idea of 'translation' is, therefore, far from compelling. But, after all this preliminary scepticism, there is still a strik- ing correspondence between Poseidon's speech and Atrahasis - the divine lot dividing up the universe. In suggesting Homeric deriva- tion of this motif from the older poem, Burkert deploys the first of two 'isolating' arguments21 in order to separate this passage from the rest of early Greek epic: This is foreign to Hesiod, and isolated within the Iliad, whereas the corresponding passage is basic to the plot of the Atrahasis.12 This is not normally the practice among the Greek gods: according to Hesiod, Zeus dethroned his predecessor - who was also his father - by force, and the other gods asked him to become their king.23 18) As Burkert 2003, 42 = 2004, 36 (as n.3) realises. Both divisions, by the way, are common in early Greek poetry; cf. E. G. Schmidt, Himmel, Erde, Meer im frühgriechischen Epos und im Alten Orient, Philologus 125 (1981) 1-24; also be- low^. 271 f. 19) Details in West (as n. 3) 109-1 1. For other Near Eastern examples of the triple division (without the lot), cf., e. g., Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the nether world 1-25 Q.Black / G.Cunningham / E.Robson / G.Zólyomi, The Literature of An- cient Sumer [Oxford 2004] 32-3); Debate between Bird and Fish 1-12 (J.Black et al. [above] 230-1). Both of these texts are с 18th с. ВС. 20) Details in M. L. West, Indo-European Poetry and Myth (Oxford 2007) 123-4. The significance of this point is underlined in another connection by N.Allen, review of West (above), BMCR 2007.10.53, with regard to the theme of "the motif of the overburdened Earth and her complaint to a supreme god. As has long been recognised, Ge's complaint to Zeus, which causes the Trojan war, paral- lels Prithivi's complaint to Brahma, which causes the central Mahabharata war. Since a third parallel occurs a millennium earlier in Atrahasis . . ., W. judges that the motif is not Graeco- Aryan but rather spread both west and east from Mesopotamia. However, the argument from chronology does not merit so much weight, and a Graeco- Ary an common origin remains likely." 21) Cf. above, p. 260 for the term, and below, p. 271 f., for the second exam- ple of its type deployed by Burkert in this connection (the apparent uniqueness of this triple division of the cosmos) and a concluding associative argument; also be- low, p. 272 f., for West's single supplementary. 22) Burkert 1983, 53 (as n.3). 23) Burkert 1992, 90 (= 1984, 87); ~ 2003, 42 (= 2004, 36) (all as n. 3).</page><page sequence="7">The Babylonian Captivity of Homer 265 There are two planks to this case: (1) the disjunction between Homer and Hesiod; and (2) the isolation of the lot motif within the Greek tradition. Let us deal with these in reverse order, in order to begin with the more important element - the characterisation of Poseidon's K^fjpoç as isolated, individual or inappropriate for Hellenic epic. However, a consideration of the traditional theme of division or SocGfióç - a term used by epic poets, their characters and modern scholars to denote the division of property or booty24 - suggests that the lot was a well nigh indispensible feature in these contexts.25 A ôaajióç may take two forms, depending on the type of material involved and the situation itself. Either (1) an existing authority figure apportions out shares of booty from a military expedition or raid ('authority Sotauóç');26 or (2) the beneficiaries in matters of property inheritance divide up that property in the ab- sence or incapacity of a paternal figure ('inheritance Ôocguoç').27 24) Cf. R. Führer, ôooiióç, LfrGE, 222. 25) The deployment of 'tradition' as an hermeneutic device in this article is grounded in the fact that both Hesiod and Homer were participants in the tradition of archaic Greek epic, a tradition witnessed primarily in the texts of these two authors, but also in the Homeric Hymns and the fragments of the so-called 'Epic Cycle'. The reconstruction, from these various sources, of the typical circum- stances, structures and motifs behind the texts is essential to a proper understand- ing of their narratives, particularly (but not only) in filling out the silences, gaps and apparent inconsistencies in those narratives. For a brief introduction to the import- ance of tradition in these terms, which has been the primary object of study for the 'oralist' school of scholarship since the groundbreaking work of Milman Parry, cf. A. Kelly, A Referential Commentary and Lexicon to Homer, Iliad VIII (Oxford 2007) 1-14 (with further bibliography). 26) In the list below (from H. van Wees, Status Warriors: War, Violence and Society in Homer and History [Amsterdam 1992] 305), the authority figure is named in brackets after the citation itself: (1) Greeks v.

The precise nature of this mechanism is not particular- ly clear, but Axxyxtxveiv - a word naturally suggestive of the кА.г|рос - is typically used to refer to the apportionment of uoîpou (I1.9.367;Od.l4.233).31 hold); and the curse laid on Eteokles and Polyneikes by Oidipous in the Theban cycle (Thebaid, frs. 2 and 3 Bernabé). 28) Cf.

This is indeed true, but his need to reject the кА,т|рос in the al- location of цшрои is because he assumes (with many others, e. g. W. Donlan, The Homeric Economy, in: I. Morris / B. B. Powell [eds.], A New Companion to Homer</page><page sequence="9">The Babylonian Captivity of Homer 267 Poseidon's story can be viewed in these terms without any difficulty. Zeus begins by dividing the yepcx, amongst which would be the claim or retention of things like the thunderbolt given him by the Kyklopes (Poseidon's yepoc might be the keeping of his own Cyclopean present, the xpíccivot32) and confirming at least some of [Leiden 1997] 649-67, 658) that it is predicated on the equality of the candidates and their shares, in that the property or material is equally divided. This could hardly be the case in Poseidon's speech (as Kallimachos recognised; cf. above, n. 16), for the house of Hades is elsewhere in Homer 'hated by the gods' (II. 20.65). Further, in Odysseus' story, the legitimate sons either exclude Odysseus' character from the lot (thus showing the preservation of hierarchy within the process) and allot him only a small portion of the inheritance (as claimed by W. Ridgeway, The Homeric Land System, JHS 6 [1885] 319-39), or he takes part in the process, but receives an un- even share from it. In either case, the property is not divided into equal parts (though one might argue, in the former eventuality, that the 'bastard's share' was taken out first, and then the land divided equally). The Hesiodic evidence is, of course, crucial, but Hesiod doesn't say that he and Perses received equal parts in the inheritance, simply that Perses is now taking more than he was originally allotted (WD 37-41). Indeed, if equal division were the rule, how did Perses persuade the 'gift devouring' kings to allow him to 'keep carrying off much extra' (37-8)? Pos- sibly by quibbling over what was truly a half share, which interpretation could draw support from the shortly following proverb 'how much more is the half than the whole' (40). Yet the imperfect tense of the frequentative &lt;popeiv (38) suggests that Perses repeatedly did this; if he were arguing each time that his prédations were aimed at an equal division, how many times would the same argument have worked? It seems to me that the quarrel is better explained on the basis of an in- heritance system in which inequality was a possible, perhaps even a likely, result of the process. On the Near Eastern possibilities of structuring an inheritance lot so as to favour the eldest son, cf. J. N. Postgate, Early Mesopotamia (London 1992) 98-9 (specifically restricted to the period 3000-1500 ВС). This could in fact strengthen Burkert's hypothesis, in that an ancient Near Eastern inheritance practice seems to reflect the situation and process which I have suggested pertained after the Titans' overthrow. Yet the actual Near Eastern circumstance has nothing to do with the Atrahasis, where the father (Anu) is still very much alive and a participant in the lot, so it seems a better hypothesis that the 'structured' lot, designed to preserve a pref- erential status in matters of inheritance, was a widespread Mediterranean phenom- enon, with a mythological reflex only in a Greek context. 32) Cf.

This gift could be an early feature of the story; after all, both Hades' cap (11.5.844-5), Poseidon's trident (II. 13.27, Od. 5.292) and Zeus' thunderbolt (Theog. 141), all mentioned as Cyclop- ean gifts in the same passage of Apollodoros, are well evidenced in early epic, though only Zeus' weapon is explicitly linked with the Kyklopes; cf. also HHPos.

The resulting settlement is still a manifestation of his authority, for the leader is always responsible for the entire process, both in allotting the material for the division,34 and being con- cerned that no-one go away from the Осшцос blaming him for its inequality.35 One might object that the division of the universe is too im- portant a matter to be left to the vagaries of a lot. However, firstly, this mechanism can throw up the 'right' winner, as e. g. choosing the men whom Odysseus would have chosen himself to help him blind the Kyklops (Od. 9.334-5).36 Secondly, van Wees has argued that the uoîpcc is routinely of greater material value than the yépa,37 so it is not incongruous that a lot should be used to settle such a weighty issue. Thirdly, it is actually typical for early Greek epic to use the language of the KÀf|poç to denote the process by which the gods received their honours.38 33) E. g., to Styx (Theog. 389-403).

These passages in- dicate that not only is a lot of some sort envisaged for the other gods' honours, but Zeus' control over this process is also assumed; the stories of Aphrodite, Hekáte and Styx suggest an ability to apportion them the same Tiuai they had held since the be- ginning, independently of any broader Ôaauóç. One should probably not seek to impose too strict a differentiation between yepa and uoîpai here (or in trying to sort out the precise stages by which the lot was taken), partially because the language is</page><page sequence="11">The Babylonian Captivity of Homer 269 These three observations apply primarily to the circumstance of the authority оосоцос, but it should not be forgotten that we have to do here also with the second ('inheritance') type of SaGjióç. A post-Titanic KÀfjpoç is actually necessary according to the norms of the early Greek epic world, because the inheriting sons - Zeus, Poseidon and Hades (Theog. 453-7) - are dividing up the кАт|рос of their absent, incapacitated father - Kronos. This situational mix- ture, viz. where the division of a private K^fjpoç between several contenders is combined with the inheritance of more generalised power over and within the community, was probably something like that pertaining in the case of Polyneikes and Eteokles,39 but is otherwise rare in the remains of early Greek epic. The unusual combination of these two ôaGjioí makes it difficult to determine precisely what were the xium, yepoc and jjxnpou involved, but the parameters of the Socgjioç as a whole render such a precise ac- counting unnecessary. What matters most of all is that any such process would, according to the social practices of early Greek epic, naturally contain something like the lot to which Poseidon makes reference. Far from being unusual or isolated in that context, as Burkert has suggested, Poseidon's post-Titanic KÀrjpoç has ex- cellent Hellenic precedent. to some degree interchangeable, but it is not hard to see Zeus removing certain func- tions from the general 'poť, as it were, and assigning them as he willed; cf. also above, n. 29, for the link between 'ioipa and taxy^áveiv in mortal ôocauoí. 39) It is not actually clear from the existing summaries and fragments pre- cisely what role Oidipous had in sorting out the succession issue, beyond deliver- ing the curse(s) on his sons (frs. 2 and 3 Bernabé); cf. J. March, The Creative Poet: Studies on the Treatment of Myths in Greek Poetry (London 1987) 125-6. The po- sition of Laertes in Ithaka might suggest that it was typical for the leading ßaaitauc in a community to retire from pre-eminence once his son was of age, so Oidipous (even without considering his special circumstance) need not have had a determi- native role in sorting out the division between his sons. The earliest (relatively) full treatment of the matter is found in the Lille Papyrus of Stesichoros (fr.222[b] PMGF), in which the solution proposed by their mother (unnamed, but either Iokaste or Euryganeia) is to divide the кАх|рос into two portions - the throne on one hand, and the flocks (cf. WD 163) and gold on the other (220-4). The one to win the lot gets the worse portion (cf. above, n. 31, for the lot between Hesiod and Perses); cf. P. Parsons, The Lille 'Stesichorus', ZPE 26 (1977) 7-36, esp.24-6. Be- cause of Stesichoros' penchant for epic recomposition and recombination (cf. A. Kelly, Stesikhoros and Helen, MH 64 [2007] 1-21, at 2-1 1), it is difficult to know how far this reflects the pre-Homeric story.</page><page sequence="12">270 Adrian Kelly On the strength of this reconstruction, we can now return to the first of Burkerťs 'planks' on this issue - the disjunction be- tween Hesiod and Homer. Let us set out the Hesiodic passage (Theog. 881-5): amàp èmí pot tcovov |шкоср£с ůeol é^exétaaoocv, TiTT|veaai Ôè xi^iácov KpívavTo ßiricpi, ôr| pa тот' wTpDvov ßaaiA,£i)£|Li£v r'5e àváaaeiv Госгпс 9paô|Lioa{)vr|iaiv КУкщпюу еърхюка Zfjv àuavocTcov ó ôè toígiv èt&gt; ôieôáaoctTo tijicxç. The first thing to note is that Hesiod's narrative of the division is confined to a single verse (885),40 but that it clearly expresses Zeus' control over the Saajióç. As we saw above, authority figures of this sort are indispensible for early epic Socojioi, since they are the ones responsible for keeping the parties to the division content and properly rewarded for their services and loyalty. It was also seen that the typical casting of lots in these circumstances is not a chal- lenge to that authority: a KÀíjpoç is in fact only possible because someone governs and guarantees the process.41 So, although Hesiod does not state positively that there was a lot in this instance, his narrative does not actually preclude it.42 His story, in other 40) The passage is interesting, for several reasons. At first sight its sequence of events seems quite clear, but the progression is a trifle misleading, for ôieôáoactTO (885) cannot only refer to settlements made after the 'election' in 883; after all, Zeus had already made several promises about nuoci before the defeat of the Titans, e. g. to Styx (389-403) and Hekáte (421-5), and took the lead in freeing and directing the Hundred Handers (501, 624 and 643). Indeed, Zeus' own statement before the final battle (389-403), where he promises not only to allow the Titans who fight with him (esp. 392 цех' eio) to retain their former honours, but also to allot xiuai and yépcc to anyone previously cmuoç imo Kpóvoi) т|5' àyépaccoç (395), makes it clear that his pre-eminence and authority were established well before whatever process is denoted at Theog. 883. Instead of an 'election', therefore, I suggest that Theog. 883 only means that the gods ratified or confirmed Zeus' right to lead them, much as, e. g., the Phaiakian ßctaiA,eic urge Alkinoos to send Odysseus home (Od. 13.47-8 rcctv-ceç ènriiveov T|ô' eicetavov / rceurcéuevcu xòv Çeívov, еле! ката uoîpctv eeuiev) well after he had already stated his intention to do so. 41) Cf. above, pp. 266-268 and n. 35. 42) This observation may perhaps be pressed further, for Hesiod frequently uses the language of the lot when speaking about this and previous divine divisions elsewhere in the poem; cf. above, n. 38, for the citations. Indeed, I would go so far as to suspect strongly that Hesiod did know of a KÀfjpoç between the brothers, but</page><page sequence="13">The Babylonian Captivity of Homer 271 words, does not rule out Poseidon's. Accordingly, one should not suggest that the Homeric and Hesiodic versions are mutually ex- clusive, as Burkert does. But this is actually secondary to, and does not affect, the most important response to Burkert's argument on Poseidon's story - а кАл^рос is in no way inappropriate or alien to the Greek conception of the divine ôotojióç. Is there, therefore, any reason to hypothesise the influence of the Atrahasis on Homer? An orientalist could reply that my demonstration has only shown that the lot motif has been adapted from Atrahasis and so thoroughly assimilated and internalised that it has become fundamental and widespread to the early Greek view of Zeus' rise to power, as witnessed also in all the post-Homeric cases in which a divine KAíjpoç is mentioned.43 That conclusion is indeed possible, but (1) this could have happened at any point from the 17th century onwards, for the Homeric text certainly gives us no reason to think that any such adaptation was a recent phenom- enon;44 and (2) this is neither the aim nor the conclusion of the standard orientalist treatment of this passage. The second of Burkert's isolating arguments on the motif can be answered more quickly: [a]lso, from another point of view, this passage is unique in Greek epic: elsewhere, when the parts of the cosmos are enumerated, there is either a triad of heaven - earth - underworld or of heaven - sea - earth, or even heaven - earth - sea - underworld, but not the triad heaven - sea - underworld, which is here assigned to the three brothers.45 did not narrate it in the Theogony simply because he had no need for it. For him, the important point was simply Zeus' control over the process as a whole, for which the lot was neither here nor there, simply an understood and conventional part of the process. 43) Cf. above, n. 16. 44) This objection will recur several times in the course of this article, espe- cially when addressing the parallels posed by West (below, pp. 292-302). It is one of the basic problems with the orientalist discussions of the DA that, in their search for isolated foreign elements, they do not properly address the probability that the feature in question is actually typical and thoroughly concordant with its immedi- ate and traditional context. Consequently, even where an inheritance might reason- ably be hypothesised, one must always reckon with the diachronic depth of the Greek tradition; cf. also below, p. 284 and n. 84, for Burkert's hasty rejection of the Bronze Age. 45) Burkert 2004, 36 (= 2003, 42); = 1992, 90-1 (= 1984, 87); cf. also 1983, 53 (allasn.3).</page><page sequence="14">272 Adrian Kelly It is indeed true that the divided realms are three in number, but the cosmos according to Poseidon comes in four parts (sea - under- world - sky - earth), or even five, if Olympos is separated from earth (II. 15.193). This is far from an isolated or unique phenome- non; such four (and five) part divisions are quite common, and de- ployed only in the contexts of divine narratives (Theog. 678-83 [sea - earth - sky - Olympos - underworld], 736-7 (= 807-8) [earth - Tartaros - sea - sky], 839-41 [earth - heaven - sea and Okeanos - underworld], HHDem.33-5 [earth - sky - sea - un- derworld46]).47 The conception of the cosmos in Poseidon's speech is not at all unusual in early Greek epic, and no evidence for the in- trusion of a 'foreign' element into the text of Homer. After these two isolating arguments, Burkert concludes his case with an associative argument, namely, that this motif occurs in the context of the 'unique' DA. This is a bit of a leap in logic, as the K^fjpoç has no necessary connection with the deception narrative,48 but much more revealing than mere proximity is the importance with which Burkert imbues it: Might this also be coincidence? There is the context to be taken into account, which has indeed a unique status within the Iliad. This pas- sage still belongs to the 'Deception of Zeus'.49 One might still believe this to be a deceptive coincidence, were it not for the special context of the Dios Apate where many different clues come together to point to the oriental tradition; in this case, the coin- cidence hypothesis becomes the most improbable option.50 In other words, Burkert admits that the parallel by itself is not strong enough, without the support of the rest of the DA, to es- tablish his thesis. If the argument of the next section against the cosmogonie status of Okeanos is even vaguely cogent, then the whole case begins to look very weak. As a final, supplementary argument in favour of Burkert 's thesis, and concerning the way in which Poseidon refers to the triple division, West suggests that 46) The underworld is not actually part of the narrative, but it is obviously assumed by the circumstance. 47) Cf. Schmidt (as n. 18) 6-9. 48) Cf. above, n.l. 49) Burkert 1983, 53 (as n.3). 50) Burkert 2004, 37 (= 2003, 42); ~ 1984, 87-8 (= 1992, 90) (all as n.3).</page><page sequence="15">The Babylonian Captivity of Homer 273 the tone of the outburst recalls Atrahasis II 266-74 = 280-8 = 332-40, where Enlil finds that mankind has survived the famine he ordained; he points out that the gods had agreed on a plan, and that it has not been kept to.51 Indeed it does, but it also recalls the 'tone' and circumstance of Poseidon's invocation of the 'agreement' to sack Troy in the very same speech (II. 15.213-17), to which Here refers when she directs her complaint to Zeus over the same matter (11.4.23-9); and to Athene's not entirely mock outrage at Zeus over keeping Odysseus away from home for so long (Od. 1.63-79, 5.21-7); or to Posei- don's disturbance at the thought that his absence has caused the gods to 'change their minds' about Odysseus (Od. 5.286 |И£те- poúÀEDGav). All of these deities react to the fact that an apparently settled course of action is no longer being adhered to, which type of situation obviously has something to do with the common di- vine caution about getting in one another's way.52 One hardly needs to look very hard in order to see how pervasive this theme is in early Greek epic. As with the motif of the lot, the possibility pre- sents itself that any putative (and I stress this word) inheritance is to be placed very far in the Homeric past. In summing up this section, it can be said that there is noth- ing in Poseidon's invocation of the divine K^fjpoç which does not make perfect sense - in terms both of its meaning and its origins - within the conventions and parameters of early Greek epic. Bur- kert's attempt to isolate this motif from that context should be con- sidered unsuccessful. 51) West (as n. 3)385. 52) For many parallels, this time responding to a very similar point which West (as n. 3) 384 seeks to make about Hypnos' reference to Zeus' anger over Hera- kles (II. 14.256), cf. below, pp. 294-296. Of course, West is not generally seeking to make precisely the same point as Burkert (i. e., more or less direct derivation), but he is trying to bolster Burkert 's position (cited and quoted approvingly at West [as n. 3] 1 80 in this very context), and in any case the qualifications which we shall ad- vance to his other parallels (below, esp. pp. 292-293) operate just as well here.</page><page sequence="16">274 Adrian Kelly 2. The 'Cosmogonie' Okeanos and Tethys and the Enuma Elis Moving on from the divine lot in the associative manner men- tioned above, Burkert begins with a general characterisation of the DA, for which he relies on Albrecht Dihle's linguistic and stylistic arguments about the 'post-oral' and therefore 'late' nature of this passage as a whole.53 Dihle's methods, and his conclusion that the passage belongs to a late, written phase in the epic tradition, have found no favour with subsequent scholarship, but they afford Burkert both an isolating description and a reason to downdate the process of inheritance: [w]e are dealing with a text which is linguistically unusual, isolated in its content, and, in a way, quite 'modern'.54 It is misleading to introduce the DA in this way, for none of the scholars cited for this view could today be invoked without seri- ous qualification,55 but it sets the direction of the entire discussion. 53) Burkert 1983, 54 ~ 1984, 88 (= 1992, 90-1); -2003, 36 (= 2004, 29) (all as n.3), referring to A.Dihle, Homer-Probleme (Opladen 1970) esp. 83-93. Dihle's method is largely to point out the apparent divergences from 'normal' Homeric usage; cf. the reviews by M.Edwards, AJP95 (1974) 68-71, esp. 70-1, and J.B. Hainsworth, CR22 (1972) 316-18, esp. 316-7. Hainsworth is particularly devas- tating on this aspect of Dihle's book, pointing out that the passage chosen is too short for proper statistical analysis, and that it is a 'leap of logic' to argue from a rather subjective list of oddities that they are the result of literary interference with the oral style. I will not deal in detail with his arguments, except to add that almost any section of Homeric poetry will throw up exceptional or unusual features. This type of analysis is an uncertain foundation for a separative argument, as shown by the fate of Page's list of anomalies at the end of the Odyssey (D. L. Page, The Homer- ic Odyssey [Oxford 1955] ch. 5); cf. H. Erbse, Beiträge zum Verständnis der Odyssee (Berlin 1972) esp. 189-229. 54) Burkert 1992, 91 and n.9 (= 1984, 88 and n.9); -2003, 36 and n.33 (= 2004, 29 and n. 33); cf. also 1983, 53-4 (all as n. 3). Only in 1983 and 2003 - sur- prisingly, as he does qualify it in 2004 - does he fail to mention the fortunes of Dih- le's argument, which has not, however, stopped him from using it; cf., e. g., Burkert 1992, 91 (= 1984, 88); - 2004, 29, where he prefaces the quote above with "[t]his re- sult has not been generally accepted; but it must ("should": 2004, 29) be acknow- ledged that in this part of the Iliad" etc. It is not at all clear why Dihle's unac- cepted impressions or conclusions "must be acknowledged"; the entire inference of these sentences must be rejected, particularly in light of Richard Janko 's excellent study (above, n. 2). 55) Aside from Dime, who is the only scholar invoked in Burkert 2003, 36 and 38 (= 2004, 29 and 32), and an obiter from Wilamowitz - increased to two in 1992, 201 n. 9 (as n. 3) - Burkert 1983, 53 n. 27 (all as n. 3) invokes the analytical tri-</page><page sequence="17">The Babylonian Captivity of Homer 275 Hence it is no surprise when, at the conclusion of this section in his treatments, Burkert returns to Dihle as the linguistic and structur- al confirmation of his own study.56 After this somewhat partial introduction, Burkert proceeds immediately to speak about the DA's 'alternative cosmogony': Okeanos is called the 'origin of gods' (II. 14.201 = 302) and the 'ori- gin for all' (II. 14.246), a status which apparently does not fit the Hesiodic conception of the universe's creation, where Gaia and Ouranos are the first couple.57 Burkert argues that this is the "only partition of the Iliad by W.

This entire nexus of isolating argumentation stems from the identification of the two sets of figures as cosmogonically equiva- lent, but the Homeric passages need not be interpreted to make Okeanos and Tethys the Original couple'.

Cer- tainly this does not suggest that the cosmogoners were either numerous or reflec- tive of general opinion, or that Aristotle followed them in their interpretation of the passages; contra Kirk et al. (as above) 17, but they do not quote the emphasised sen- tence ei (lèv oùv . . . áÔT|X,ov e'vn., which makes Aristotle's uncertainty clear, as noted by W.D.Ross, Aristotle's Metaphysics Volume 1 (Oxford 1924) ad loc, 130: "the suggestion has no great historical value, as Aristotle himself admits (984a2)." Nor is Met. 1091b4 contrary evidence, for, though Aristotle speaks there of the ancient poets explaining how Zeus is in charge rather than 'the first' gods (xouc лреошис), he lists as their examples those figures (Night, Chaos, Ouranos and Okeanos) who are so linked at Theog. 20 and 106-7. Furthermore, Plato "is obviously not entire- ly serious in his treatment of Homer as forerunner of the flux-idea assigned to Hera- clitus, so we cannot be sure of the precise value he attached to the Homeric Okeanos-passage" (Kirk et al. [as above] 15). In sum, whilst there was indeed an an- cient strand of the cosmogonie reading, it was by no means an inevitable or unani- mous interpretation. 58) Burkert 1992, 91 (= 1984, 88); -2003, 36 (= 2004, 30) (all as n.3). 59) Enuma Eus is cited according to the translation ot Dalley (as n. 12). 60) D.

The first of these is delivered by Here to Aphrodite (and then to Zeus 301-2), the second by Hypnos to Here when attempting to refuse participation in her scheme. In the latter passage, the crucial question concerns the noun to which the phrase yéveGiç rcávxeaai in v. 246 refers. Most scholars have taken it with ůeéov from v. 244, or made it refer simply to 'all things'; however, Panchenko sug- gested that it refers to péeůpa, thus implying that Okeanos is mere- ly the origin of all rivers. This may seem on first sight a rather cramped reading, with rcavxeGOi amplifying one noun from a for- mulaic phrase,61 but the Homeric poet himself seems to understand the matter in this way in a later passage in the Iliad, where Achilleus compares the progeny of Zeus with that of the rivers (21.194-7): al) scepticism, by Kirk et al. (as above, n. 57) 14. However elliptical the reading may seem, is it any more difficult than to follow a cosmogonical reading and suppose that Homer has in these two passages forgotten his earlier description of the Titans as 'sons of Ouranos' at II. 5.898 (cf. J. Latacz et al., Homers Ilias; Gesamtkommen- tar Band 1.2: 1.

This is a suggestive complement to Hypnos' description of Oke- anos in II. 14.246. Firstly, consider the generic similarity between the passages; in both speeches, Zeus' superiority is emphasised by reference to the fact he is even more powerful than Okeanos, whose source of strength (and suitability for the comparison) is underlined by his genealogical status. To this end, Achilleus' em- phatic anaphora of rcávxeç, я&amp;аа, and пасах should be compared with TiavxeoGi in II. 14.246, and could be considered a fuller ver- sion of the rhetorical ellipse in that earlier passage. This gives at least some justification to interpret rcavxeooi in the limited manner Panchenko does. The ellipse could still be considered difficult, however, and not only because of the proximity of II. 14.201 (to which we shall return). Nonetheless, consider the semantics of Homeric rc&amp;ç, specifically the fact that its universalism can be qualified by its cir- cumstance.62 Artur Ludwich drew attention to this quality when discussing the famous crux of II. 1.5, where an ancient v. 1. (Загса) arose because лааг was interpreted literally, i.e. implying that every bird eats flesh, or that every bird in the world swooped down on the plains of Troy.63 It only means that every bird present and appropriate did so, just as the fulfilment of Poseidon's proposal for equipment exchange (II. 14.376-7) does not result literally in 'everyone' (návcaq 381) receiving new equipment, simply those who were subject to the circumstance set out in Poseidon's speech. So Homeric лас can denote the entirety of a group considered 62) I am indebted to Alan Sommerstein for discussion and clarification on this point. Of course, even in the ancient world, it was well known that Homeric or, indeed, poetic лас need not be taken literally; cf. Aristotle, Poetics 146 lai 9: to yap jiáviEç àvTi xoû noXkoi каха nexoupopàv eípr'xav to yàp rcâv noXv xi (citing II. 2.1-2 in mistake for II. 10.1, and then juxtaposing it to 10.13-14). 63) A.

I suggest, therefore, that an alternative cosmogony is the last thing on Homer's mind at II. 14.246: Okeanos is here the origin of all water deities, as he is everywhere else in Homer and the rest of early Greek epic, and nothing more. Turning back now to the first, apparently cosmogonie, ex- pression DkeocvÓv те ůecov yeveoiv mi |ir|T£pa Tr|iK&gt;v (II. 14.201), one could argue that the only sense in which Tethys is a 'mother' is the usual one of having divine children, whilst Okeanos is the 'origin' only of those gods listed by Achilleus at 11.21.194-7 and 64) Cf., for some other (substantival) cases, 11.6.15 (mvxaç yàp (piAieaicev обол ётп oiKia vaícov); II. 17.356 (Aïaç yàp uáÀ,a rcávxaç érccoixexo коХка keXexhùv); lì. 24.775 (rcávxeç ôe rceippimaiv); Od. 11.216 (ю uoi, xeicvov euóv, rcepi rcávxcov muuope (pcoxcov); Od. 12.323 (HeAío'), oç rcávx' éípopíxi Kai Tcávx' èrcaicoúei [= 11.109], but cf. 12.374f.); Od. 13.312-13 (àpya^éov ae, ůeá, yvcovai ßpoxcoi àvxiácavxi / mi uáA,' érciaxccjiévcoi* ae yòtp a')XT]v rcavxi éíaiceiç); Od. 23.28 (ò ^eívoç, xòv rcávxeç àxíficov év ueyápoiai); WD 80-2 (òvójrnve Ôè xr|vÔe yuvaím / navôcopr|v, oxi яаухес K)Xx&gt;'Lnia Осоцах' exovxeç / Ôcopov ¿ôcopriaav). 65) That such an ellipse was possible depends, of course, on the assumption that Okeanos was a well-known character in the epic tradition before Homer (and Hesiod). This, I think, may be inferred inter al. from his genitive case noun-epithet formulae, extending from the two major boundary positions within the verse to the verse-end, and showing the Parryan principles of economy and extension: pccťhjppóoi) £2iceavoîo (II. 7.422, 14.311, Od. 11.13, 19.434) and à'|/oppóo') вкеауою (11.18.399, Od. 20.65, Theog. 776); cf. also the solely Hesiodic kXdxoû вкеауою (Theog. 215, 274, 288, 294). The Economy' here is clear, but for the 'extension', cf. M. Parry, L'Épithète traditionelle dans Homère (Paris 1928) 69-9 (also in: A. Parry [ed.], The Making of Homeric Verse: the collected papers of Milman Parry [Oxford 1971] 55-63). An individual poet is unlikely to come up with even a small system exhibiting these features; cf. Parry (as above) 17-18 (also in: A. Parry [as above] 18). ßat^ppooi) and шуорроог) are, moreover, 'special epithets' - i.e., confined to Okeanos - which are generally used for "divine or, with some exceptions, . . . major characters in the story" (J. B. Hainsworth, The Flexibility of the Homeric Formula [Oxford 1968] 10). The exceptions listed by Parry (as above) 111-13 (also in: A. Parry [as above] 88-93) concern single examples of one special epithet; the only characters in that list to have two such epithets are major players (Achilleus, Odysseus, Agamemnon, Hektor, Herakles). Not too much can be made of that last fact, because the gods are frequently provided with special epithets, as even a quick glance at J. H. Dee, Epitheta Deorum apud Homerum (Hildesheim 2001) will show.</page><page sequence="22">280 Adrian Kelly Hesiod in the Tbeogony.66 Thus, II. 14.201 has no more (and no less) significance than Zeus' epithet тсостпр àvôpôv те ůecov те (II. 1.544 etc.), which does not imply that Zeus is the father of all the gods or all men, any more than calling Ide the 'mother of flocks' means that Phrygia is the origin of species.67 In short, the hypothesis of an alternative cosmogony in these two Homeric pas- sages is an unnecessary one.68 Given the importance of this paral- lel to Burkert's entire equation between the DA and the Enuma Elis, the case for Homeric dependence on a Near Eastern source must be weakened. Nonetheless, on this basis Burkert proceeds to make two fur- ther arguments - the first thematic, the second linguistic. Neither is persuasive when examined by itself, let alone when deprived of its cosmogonie support. The former is of the isolating sort, and runs as follows: 66) There is, of course, the signal phenomenon that no other divine parent is denoted with the word yeveoic in early Greek epic; cf. M. Schmidt, yéveoiç, LfrGE, 130. I suggest this is another (cf. previous note) traditional particularity in the dic- tion applicable to Okeanos, reflecting the fact that his relationship with his children assumes a physical contiguity, and a constant process of renewal, which is not repli- cated in other divine generative contexts. Interestingly, yéveaiç as a scientific term seems to have been used in early Presocratic thought to denote the (frequently nev- erending) process of 'coming-to-be'; cf., e.g., Anaximander В 1 DK, with W. K. C. Guthrie, A History of Greek Philosophy I: The Earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans (Cambridge 1962), 77 n. 1 (the term / concept was somewhat dis- credited by Parmenides [B 8.21 DK] before its rehabilitation by Plato and Aristo- tle; cf. F. Solmsen, Aristotle's System of the Physical World [Ithaca NY 1960] chs. 2 and 4). Such a notion is particularly appropriate to a figure described as àyóppooç 'flowing back on itself and who constantly feeds the waters of the world, i. e., his children (Theog. 790-1, with M.L.West, Hesiod Theogony [Oxford 1966] ad loc, 374); cf. A.Kelly, A^OPPOOY UKEANOIO - A Near Eastern expression? CQ 57 (2007) 280-2 (with bibliography). In any case, Okeanos' status as origin of all rivers and water courses makes him a unique figure in divine genealogy, so we should not be surprised to hear him described in a unique way. 67) Cf. II. 8.47, 14.283, 15.151; also II. 11.222, where 'щтгр' 'щк&lt;м is applied to Thrace. Of course, Hesiod refers to Ge as rcocvxcov цт|тпр (WD 563), but this shows how loosely the word could be used in a cosmogonie context. In Hesiod's own narrative, Gaia is only the direct mother of a relatively small number of deities, and cannot be linked genealogically, e. g., with the children of Chaos and Night (Theoe. 123-5), but such precision is hardly the point in these expressions. 68) That all other ancient references to this interpretation are to be sourced back to precisely these two passages, and have no earlier or wider currency, is argued cogently by Kirk et al. (as n. 57).</page><page sequence="23">The Babylonian Captivity of Homer 281 The very climax of this song of Homer - Zeus and Here making love within a golden cloud on the summit of Mount Ida, from which re- splendent drops are falling - shows divinity in a naturalistic, cosmic setting which is not otherwise a feature of Homeric anthropomor- phism.69 It has often been remarked that the DA refers to a number of 'cos- mic' events, including the first sexual activity of Zeus and Here (II. 14.295-6) and the enmity between Zeus and Kronos (II. 14.203- 4), but in what sense are these stories more 'cosmic' than, e. g., the references to Zeus' conflict with Typhaon (11.2.781-3) or the in- surrection of the Olympians, which would have undermined the divine order (II. 1.397-406)? Whilst the activity on Ide might well re-enact a (rather vague notion of the) original iepòç yájioc, is this more 'cosmic' in its suggestions than Zeus' threat to hurl disobe- dient deities into Tartaros, with his unpleasant descriptions of its environs (11.8.13-16; repeated with reference to Iapetos and Kro- nos themselves at 8.477-81), or (much better) the Theomachy of Book 2 1?70 Furthermore, a 'naturalistic' setting or description is typical for divine narratives in early Greek epic, whether the poet is de- scribing the effect on the natural surroundings of the gods' activ- ities, or simply locating them there.71 Consider the depiction of Kalypso's cave (Od. 5.63-73), the blasting of nature by Hephaistos in his attack on Skamandros (11.21.350-5), the progress of Posei- don over the water (II. 13.27-30), the shuddering of the earth as the gods face off before the Theomachy (II. 20.59-66), the blooming of vegetation as Aphrodite reaches Kypros (Theog. 194-5), the ani- 69) Burkert 1992, 91 (= 1984, 88); -2003, 36 (= 2004, 30) (all as n.3). 70) Moreover, L.Slatkin, The Power of Thetis (Berkeley 1991) has argued that there is a cosmological undercurrent to the entire Iliad, centred around the un- settling generative potential of Thetis for the hegemony of Zeus. 71) West (as n.3) 384 notes: [tjhis (burgeoning nature) appears simply to serve their comfort and pleasure, but behind it probably lies the idea that the activity of the love-goddess makes the vegetation burgeon." [my emphasis] He points to Hesiod, Theog. 194 as a parallel, before invoking a Sumerian prayer to Ishtar, where however the goddess is herself said to cause these things actively, rather than having them simply spring up in reaction to her presence. Aside from West's cautious phrasing, note also that this verdancy is known to Homer in the DA, to Hesiod and to the poet of the HHAphr. (see the discussion above). Once more this motif, if it is not coincidental, has been thoroughly hellenised and epicised, sug- gesting a general inheritance or interaction rather than a specific and late source.</page><page sequence="24">282 Adrian Kelly mais fawning on the same deity and making love as she approach- es Mount Ide (HHAphr. 69-74), or those around the house of Kirke (Od. 10.212-19), or the catalogue of flowers amongst which Persephone plays (HHDem. 5-14). As Janko comments, a[t]he sympathy of nature is normal in the heroic world,72 and our aware- ness of it is fundamental to the beauty of that world",73 so it is sim- ply incorrect to say that the setting of the love-scene in the DA is 'not elsewhere a feature of Homer's anthropomorphism', let alone that of the other early epic texts. Burkert's second, linguistic argument also faces considerable objections. He suggests an equation between Taw(a)tu and Tr|iK)ç, on the analogy of Greek Mf|Soi from Persian Mada, but the anal- ogy takes insufficient account of the consonant -w- in Taw(a)tu. Assuming (with Burkert) that the translation occurred during the Archaic period, the resulting word would be subject to the usual phonological changes consequent on the loss of intervocalic digamma, but in Ionic at this period (i. e. well after the early change to r| of inherited long a) the result of a contraction from the clus- ter -a/a- is not Tj but a, as axr| &lt; *à/áxr| &lt; *à/áxa, whilst Aeolic would show -aua-, as Lesb. aí)ám &lt; *а/ата (cf. also vaûoç &lt; va/oç).74 One might also doubt that these linguistic changes would have been mirrored by an epic poet, if he were responsible for the translation in the first place, for the 'Kunstsprache' is more than able to resist contraction after the loss of intervocalic digamma (e. g., àayriç &lt; à/ayea-, àeíôco &lt; à/eíôco, àoiôr| &lt; à/oiôri, àaoícp- pcov &lt; à/aaai + (ppev-)75 and creates without linguistic 'justifica- 72) Cf., e.g., Odysseus' description of Goat Island (Od. 9. 11 6-51) or Laertes' garden (Od. 24.336-44). 73) Janko (as n.2) ad II. 13.27-31, 45. 74) As a general rule "аа ergibt bei Kontraktion überall auch а" (E.Schwyzer, Griechische Grammatik I 1: Lautlehre und Wortbildung.

In any case, West has poured cold water on the entire equa- tion, pointing out that the spelling Taw(a)tu is an apparent ar- chaism for the much commoner T(i)amat (which would make the idea of a late borrowing virtually impossible) and was probably never a spoken form, and so he returns to Szemerényi's derivation of Tethys from Tiamat I Tamtu J7 This could have occurred at any point from the sixteenth century ВС onwards, given that the Enu- ma Elis is to be dated to the Middle Babylonian period.78 If there was a translation or adaptation, then it occurred well before the Homeric poet came to his composition.79 Indeed, Burkerťs point about the isolation of Tethys could be invoked here, but against his conclusion, to support a very early date for such a process: . . . there is the name of that primeval mother, Tethys, a purely mytho- logical name for Greeks, as far as we see, not connected with any liv- ing cult (quite in contrast to Thetis) and known to everyone just from this very passage of Homer.80 Tethys is in no way an active figure in Greek mythology. In contrast to the sea goddess Thetis (with whom she was sometimes confused even in antiquity) she has no established cults, and no one had anything fur- ther to tell about her. She apparently exists only by virtue of the Home- ric passage.81 76) Cf. H. Erbse / S.

In these terms, Tethys' mythological as opposed to cultic 'Lebendigkeit' could just as eas- ily be explained as a very early inheritance which survived the col- lapse of the Mycenaean world - with all its contraction of the con- tacts between Greece and the surrounding civilisations - only in epic narrative. Such 'against the odds' transmission through the Dark Ages into a world where it was no longer widely understood, or indicative of broader belief, can be easily paralleled in Homeric language82 and geography.83 To sum up the results of this section: (1) there is no need to conclude that the DA contains a unique or alternative cosmogony, for the crucial passages and expressions admit of a much simpler explanation, which chimes with the rest of Homer's text and, in- deed, early Greek epic; (2) the naturalistic and 'cosmic' (?) setting of the DA is entirely typical of early Greek poetry, and no proof of external influence on the Homeric poet; (3) the linguistic origin of the name Tethys is extremely conjectural and, if drawn from the Near East, should be located much earlier than Burkert allows.84 In short, there is no support here for the theory that the DA is a Near Eastern derivation. 82) Cf., e. g., A.

Ini- tially, Burkert 1983, 54-5 (as n. 3) relied solely on Dihle's work to rule out the Mycenaean period but, given the lack of success his theories have had, Burkert 1984, 89-90 (= 1992, 93 ~ 2003, 37-8 = 2004, 31-2 [all as n. 3]) contended that oral trans- mission would have changed the story too much, and doubted whether the Enuma Elis was to be dated that early. On the latter point, cf. above, n. 78, for the views of Near Eastern specialists. The worth of the former point depends entirely on ac- cepting the parallels which Burkert offers. As I hope to have demonstrated, this is no firm basis on which to rule out Mycenaean interaction. Indeed, it has already been suggested that several motifs, e. g., the name of Tethys, could have been inher- ited from Near Eastern traditions, but the crucial point is that, b y the time we witness these motifs in a Greek setting, they are thoroughly harmonised within that context (so much so, in some cases, that one doubts whether it was a question of inheritance at all). This point shall be made again.</page><page sequence="27">The Babylonian Captivity of Homer 285 When combined with the conclusion of the first section of this article, the entire case that the DA is derived from the Near East must be severely undermined, for these are the two main props of the whole structure: It is the specific motif of the primordial water gods, and the motif of the gods casting lots for the three portions of the universe, that must be judged 'a neo-Oriental element' in the text of Homer, as Martin West has put it.85 Thus the proof seems complete that here, right in the middle of the Iliad, the influence of two Akkadian classics can be detected down to a mythical name.86 These motifs can bear no such weight. 3. Supplementary Parallels (Burkert et al) Moving forward from the cosmogonie Okeanos, Burkert proceeds to identify several other oriental elements within the DA, opening the account with an associative argument: Once an orientalizing background is established for the 'Deception of Zeus', further observations are bound to follow.87 Obviously, then, the validity of these parallels depends first and foremost on the two major motifs discussed above, so it is not sur- prising that in isolation they do not stand up to scrutiny. I will dis- cuss the three strongest of these features here, omitting only the most speculative.88 85) Burkert 1983, 54 (as n.3). 86) Burkert 1992, 93 (= 1984, 90); ~ 2003, 38 (= 2004, 32) (all as n. 3). 87) Burkert 1992, 93 (= 1984, 90); ~ 2003, 38 (= 2004, 32) (all as n. 3). 88) Amongst them, the idea that Zeus and Here on the top of the mountain is reflected on Near Eastern seals where the storm god and his wife ride on their dragons (no dragons anywhere in sight in the DA), that the marriage of heaven and earth are known in Akkadian literature (no fecundity in the DA), and the link be- tween clay deities in Akkadian (titu) and the Titans as the defeated deities (of which Burkert 1992, 95 [= 1984, 91; -2003, 40 = 2004, 34] [all as n.3] says a[t]his daring hypothesis . . . lacks specific material for verification"); cf. Burkert 1983, 54-5; 1984, 90-1 (= 1992, 94-5); ~ 2003, 38-40 (= 2004, 32-4). His further argument to this last point, that the Titans are mentioned in three of their five total Homeric occasions in the DA (II. 5.898, 8.478-80, 14.274,279, 15.225), indicates nothing whatsoever, for they appear consistently in the Iliad in the context of divine strife and contention,</page><page sequence="28">286 Adrian Kelly They begin with the кеотос of Aphrodite (11.14.214-17), which "seems to be oriental in a particular way", and which is de- scribed as having various qualities appropriate to Aphrodite fash- ioned or present on it (тегикто 14.215), including (piÀóxriç, ïjxepoç, òotpiGTt)ç, and indeed iîeA,Krr|pia rcávxoc.89 It has long been known that a description of a 'saltire' around the chest (or a girdle of some sort around the waist)90 is a typical feature in the iconography of Ishtar / Ashtarte / Atargatis / Aphrodite from early in the third millennium ВС,91 and several scholars have enthusiastically en- dorsed and developed Burkert's rather bald statement. For instance, starting from the indistinct nature of these qual- ities and their presence on the кеотос, Faraone argues that magical spells from the Neo- Assyrian period (c. 1000 ВС) offer the most suggestive parallel for an item which increases the (not only sexu- al) attractiveness of the wearer as he or she attempts to get some- thing out of the addressee, so to speak. The way he links this to the DA is, however, all rather indirect: [Here's] prayers to Aphrodite and Sleep are perhaps connected with the other religious overtones of the scene on Mt. Ida, which seems to reflect aspects of the íepòç уацос of Zeus and Hera. Perhaps a prayer as illustrations of what happens to those who oppose Zeus, which concords per- fectly with Hesiod's picture as "an older generation of gods ... no longer active in the world" (West [as above, n. 66] ad Theog. 133, 200). 89) Burkert 1992, 93 and n. 18 (not in 1984; -2003, 38 and n.44 [= 2004, 32 and n.44]) (all as n.3) refers to C. Bonner, KEITOI IMAI and the saltire of Aphrodite, AJP 70 (1949) 1-6, and Faraone (as n. 3) esp. 220-9, both of whom are much more cautious about both the fact and the time of any Near Eastern inheri- tance; cf. Bonner (as above) 6: "[t]he argument for identifying the кеатос iuáç with the saltire of the ancient goddess of fecundity deserves to be considered; no more is claimed for it"; Faraone (as n. 3) 240: "[s]uch direct influence is, however, more dif- ficult to document when we shift from the rich archaeological record to the paltry remains of early Greek literature and myth"; id. 241: "we have no way of proving conclusively that the Near Eastern material was borrowed by the Greeks during the eighth century, or for that matter at any particular point in time ... Although my guess would be that these rituals were in fact borrowed at some point from the older and more sophisticated societies of the Near East, there is simply no way to prove it or to disprove a competing claim that such magical rituals evolved inde- pendently in many traditional societies in the circum-Mediterranean basin." 90) Cf.

Such a ritual may it- self have been borrowed from the east, for scholars have long sus- pected Near Eastern influence in Greek celebrations of this sacred wedding.92 [my emphasis] The caution in this language is warranted, for Faraone attempts to read a ritual or religious 'Ur'-narrative beneath a series of Homer- ic features which are not in themselves unparalleled or remark- able.93 Secondly, each step in the process is deeply conjectural: A may be linked with B, which may be linked with C, and so on, so it is no surprise when he associatively invokes the 'other' Near Eastern feature of the episode, namely the cosmogonie Okeanos,94 without the support of which his case can hardly be considered persuasive. But perhaps the most important reason why this is so may be found, once more, through considering the Greek context. Faraone argues that the qualities present on the кеатос are inherent in the item, which would render it a magic amulet of the sort one finds in the Near East.95 Yet the endowing of an item with qualities can be widely observed in the early epic art of ekphrasis, as Faraone him- self points out, alluding to the presence "Epic, ААлсг| and Icoicri (and the Gorgon's head) on the aiyíç (II. 5.740-1), and (more purely pic- torial) "Epic, K')Soi|Lióç and Krjp on Achilleus' shield (II. 18.535) or 92) Faraone (as n. 3) 229.

In all these ways, the ociyíç is an excellent com- parandum for Aphrodite's magical love-strap,99 and provides Greek epic precedent for a divinely-made and worn item to be con- ceived and described in this way.

None of this decisive- ly rules out a Near Eastern inheritance or borrowing but, given the assimilation of this item into its Greek context (and its own prob- able Indo-European heritage), one cannot argue that it is a recent adaptation which the Homeric poet is trying to fit into a new set- ting. Secondly, Burkert suggests that Zeus' catalogue of his lovers (II. 14.315-28) "has its counterpart in Gilgamesh's enumeration of the lovers of Ishtar."102 Yet the contexts and purposes of these two catalogues are entirely different: whilst Zeus lists his previous affairs to illustrate his current desire for Here, Gilgamesh enumer- ates to an eager Ishtar her previous lovers and their rather unfor- tunate fates as reasons for him not to become involved with her (SBV 6.2.7-3. 10). 103 As such, a much better comparison in Greek epic would be Kalypso's list of goddesses with mortal lovers who have come to a bad end (Od. 5.118-29), but even then it is not a precise parallel for the Gilgamesh passage, since Kalypso com- plains about the preclusive attitude of the male gods in preventing or punishing such episodes, whilst Gilgamesh is refusing to get in- volved in the type of action demanded. Perhaps, however, it is quibbling to ask that the parallel be so precise, rather than seeking a common principle behind the pas- sages, as West does: [t]hey have in common the principle of collecting together a number of separate mythical events of a particular type and ordering them in a series.104 But this is true of, and basic to, all early Greek epic poetry; on this particular theme alone, and aside from Kalypso's list, consider the concluding catalogues of the Theogony (886-1022), Odysseus' cat- 101) P.

Much the same point is to be made about the last of Burkerťs supplementary cases, Here's cosmic oath by Earth, Heaven and Styx, which she makes on Zeus waking and threatening her with serious damage (II. 15.36-8), and which is, in fact, paralleled in sev- eral Near Eastern traditions: It is precisely such a cosmic formula which concludes the enumera- tion of divine witnesses in the only Aramaic treaty text which has sur- vived from the eighth century: 'Heaven and earth, the deep and the springs, day and night'.106 [my emphasis] One wonders what the word "precisely" is doing here,107 for the differences between these texts are tremendous. Firstly, the Iliadic formula i s the list of divine witnesses - not the conclusion of a larger list. Secondly, how is Styx a parallel for "the deep and the springs", and what of the absence of "day and night" in the Iliad, or the fact that Here goes on (II. 15.39-40) to swear by their mar- riage bed? Perhaps more importantly, the 'parallel' utterly disre- gards the dynamics of the oath in Greek epic, which is one of the most well-recognised typical scenes in Homeric poetry.108 105) Cf.

First of all, Here's oath by Gaia, Ouranos and Styx is repeated verbatim in the Odyssey (5.184-6) and again in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (85- 6).109 Unless we propose a stemmatic relationship, or that they are all drawing on the same Near Eastern exemplar, then the concaten- ation of these three figures in this context is a traditional Greek one. Secondly, Gaia and Ouranos are also coupled in another oath from the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (334-6),110 this time together with the Titans,111 whilst the formulaic expression used in all four of these oaths (yaîcx mi ovpocvòç e')p')ç vmpůe) is also found out- side an oath context (Theog. 702).112 Thirdly, the invocation of Styx is not only foreshadowed by Hypnos' request that Here swear by this river (II. 14.271-4),113 but her typical presence in such oaths,114 which is of course justified by her description in Hesiod (Theog. 383-403, 775-806).115 So, once more, the motif is thoroughly embedded in its Hel- lenic epic context, though again this need not imply some hermet- ically sealed culture. Indeed, Burkert et al. make it clear that these sorts of oaths are found in a large number of separate Near East- ern traditions, including the Aramaic, Hebrew and Sumerian, stretching from the late Bronze Age to the Archaic period and later.116 We would do better to think of the broad tradition, con- 109) Cf.

In concluding this section, and my critique of Burkerťs treat- ments of the DA, it should be remembered that the three parallels discussed above are of secondary importance to the divine lot and the cosmogonie Okeanos; if those features cannot show the DA to be an 'oriental' episode, the supplemental are unlikely to do the job. Nonetheless, by themselves, they are hardly compelling evi- dence that the Homeric poet was under more or less direct Near Eastern influence in his composition of the DA. As with the divine lot, the typicality of these features within the context of early Greek epic implies evolution in an Hellenic tradition, increasing to probability the likelihood that any such adaptation occurred so long before the Homeric poet as to have become, for all intents and purposes, a native element. Add to this the need to avoid exagger- ated or misidentified parallels, and it becomes clear that Burkerťs ťharď117 orientalism is too blunt a tool adequately to capture the complexities of the early epic tradition. 4. Miscellanea Orientalia (West) Aside from several points shared with Burkerťs treatments (and referred to in the footnotes above), West's monumental East Face of Helicon adds quite a few more parallels for our considera- tion.118 However, although he concludes that the Iliad poet was familiar with a certain recension of Gilgamesb, he is generally much more cautious than Burkert in explaining similarities be- tween the DA and the texts of ancient Near East: [i]t is not that the Greek poet is drawing capriciously from models in different countries; it is rather that there is a broad stream of interna- tional tradition, the present evidence for which is somewhat fragment- ed.119 117) This term, coined on the analogy of 'hard* and 'soft' oralism (or 'Par- ryism'), denotes the practice of using Near Eastern sources as more or less direct 'Quellen' for the early Greek epic texts; cf. below, pp. 292 f., 301 f., for West's 'soft' orientalism. 118) West (as n. 3)382-5. 119) West (as n.3) 401.

Since, therefore, West is not trying to make a case for more or less direct derivation of the DA from a Near Eastern text or texts,120 he places less weight on any single parallel, and is not really concerned with the question of how these similarities arose.121 Indeed, one wonders in many cases what the purpose of the parallel is, beyond making the very general - and indisputable - point that ancient Greek poets used many of the same motifs as poets in a number of cultures around the Mediterranean basin from the Bronze Age onwards. Nonetheless, the kind of criticisms directed earlier against Burkert can also be applied here, firstly because his conclusions about the DA are invoked with approval, but also because West's arguments are essentially associative in nature. Though there are no more isolating points, he still deploys a Tarallelismus' which over- plays similarities with Near Eastern features to the same extent it underplays the position of the feature within ancient Greek epic. Therefore, each of his parallels needs to be examined just as those discussed earlier. But now to the specifics. mistakably Greek, or at least hellenized, ... the most reasonable view is that theogony was a traditional genre with a long history before Hesiod." For the 'hard' conclusion about the Iliad and Gilgamesh, cf. West (as n. 3) 401: "[b]ut in the case of Achilles we are faced with the inescapable fact of a special relationship with one particular oriental text: the Gilgamesh epic. The parallels are too numerous and spe- cific to allow of another explanation . . . We can even say what recension of the Gil- gamesh epic it must have been." Like Burkert (cf. above, n. 12), West's methods and conclusions are enjoying public currency. 120) For a similar conclusion about the Hittite Song of Release, cf. M. Bachvarova, The Eastern Mediterranean Epic tradition from Bilgames andAkka to the Song of Release to Homer's Iliad, GRBS 45 (2005) 131-54, esp. 153: "al- though Greek epic could have had the opportunity to draw on Anatolian versions of Mediterranean epic, there is no reason to assume that Homer or one of his an- cestors directly imitated the Song of Release, any more than we should assume that they directly imitated a version of Gilgamesh preserved for us. All of these songs are drawing on a wider tradition of which only a few examples are preserved, whether from the Mycenaean period or from the Archaic period." 121) Though he devotes the last chapter or the East Face to the question, it is of course necessary that he close with a disclaimer about the processes hypothe- sised, which are in any case of secondary importance for his purpose; cf. below, p.301f.</page><page sequence="36">294 Adrian Kelly To begin with, the scene of Here's preparations for the DA (II. 14.161-86) "stands in a well-established oriental literary tradi- tion",122 on which West says: Just as (Greek and NE traditions) only register significant nights, so they only attest to significant dressing. There is one particular context, common to the Mesopotamian, Hurro-Hittite, and Greek traditions, in which this occurs, namely when a goddess dresses and adorns her- self in order to meet her lover or seduce or impress someone. This goes back to the Sumerian cult of Inanna and Dumuzi. Regardless of the many external parallels, the toilet in question is a narrative pattern of some frequency in early Greek epic poetry; aside from Here's preparations, consider the beautification of Penelope (Od. 18.192-7), of Aphrodite (Od. 8.362-6; HHAphr. 58-66), either Aphrodite and / or Helen before the seduction of Paris (Kypria frs. 4 and 5 Bernabé) and Pandora (Theog. 573-84, WD 63-8). This multiplicity of examples, and their essential struc- tural similarity, argues for a typical 'seduction' scene, the female equivalent of the hero's arming sequence, one of the earliest recog- nised tools in the oral poet's inventory, and so something which is (again) thoroughly assimilated and integrated within a Greek con- text.124 If Hellenic epic copied or adapted this motif from a Near Eastern tradition, this happened well before Homer, for whose scene(s) the invocation of Near Eastern parallels explains little. Next, Here's125 promise of an Hephaistian footstool and chair to Hypnos (II. 14.238-41) is paralleled in Ugaritic epic (terminus ante quern 1180 ВС) where Baal instructs Kothar to make a seat and footstool in order to win the support of Athirat. The passages are indeed very close, for they combine divine bribery and the na- ture of the gift, viz. a chair and footstool made by the craftsman god. Again, however, the similarity is not quite exact, for the gift is promised but not delivered in the Greek text,126 because Hypnos 122) West (as n. 3)382. 123) West (as n. 3)204. 124) Cr. N.

More importantly, the association be- tween these two items of furniture is extremely common in Homer- ic epic,127 whilst there is even a direct parallel in the Odyssey for someone making a fine chair and adding a footstool to the package (Od. 19.55-8 lili лосрос uev KÀaaíriv jcupl miueoav, evi}' äp ècpîÇe / Sivcornv èÀiípavTi m! àpyupcoi* r'v лоте tektcov / 7iovno' 'IkuxxA,ioç Kai i&gt;no ůpfjvuv KOGiv т|ке / rcpoaqxoe' è£ осг&gt;тг|с). In that case, the craftsman is the otherwise unknown Ikmalios128 but, in a divine context, who else should construct the chair but Hephaistos? His role is also suggested by his relationship with Here, who elsewhere exhibits a powerful influence over him,129 whilst making such an offer to an interlocutor in order to secure adherence is extremely common.130 All of these factors lead me to suggest that indepen- dent generation of the same motif is as likely an explanation as even a shared inheritance. Thirdly, it may well be true that the motif of the "chief god's anger on discovering that his plans have been thwarted"131 (II. 14.256) occurs several times in Atrahasis (and other Near East- ern texts) yet outbursts on this basis from frustrated gods - and not just the chief - are a dime a dozen in Greek epic, as West notes.132 127) Cf. I1.18.389-90 (Thetis received by Hephaistos); Od. 1.130-1, 4.136, 10.314-15 = 10.366-7 (1.131-10.314 = 10.366), 19.55-8 (kXigÍti). For the link between a tfpíivuç and ei^ocTuvaÇcû, cf.

Lacroix that Ikmalios (perhaps derived from ikuíxç 'sweat' and referring to glue) was "the earliest Greek furniture crafts- man". 129) He is summoned to battle in the Theomachy by Here (11.21.330-42), who also calls him off (367-76), and he rescues the worsening situation between Zeus and Here in their opening confrontation (II. 1.571-94; cf. also 15.18-24), re- minding his mother of a previous occasion when he came to her defence and was cast out of heaven for his pains. This paradigm probably gave rise to the story of a second fall (11.18.394-9; cf. M.Edwards, The Iliad; A Commentary, Volume V: Books 17-20 [Cambridge 1991] ad II. 18.394-409, 192-3), where their relationship is considerably less rosy. 130) Cf., e.g., 11.8.289-91, 10.212-17, 10.304-7, 24.429-31; also Kelly (as n.25)§ 147, 280-1. 131) West (as n.3) 180 n.37; also 385 for Enhl angry at the survival of men (and above, n. 52). 132) Cf. also above, p. 272 f., for West's similar argument about Poseidon's complaint in II. 15.184-95.</page><page sequence="38">296 Adrian Kelly A cursory list would include Zeus' reactions to Prometheus' de- fence of mankind (WD 53-9; Theog. 565-70) and his £iepoÇr|taoç division (Theog. 542-61); Here's fury at Zeus, because of his ap- parent opposition to their previous agreement to destroy Troy (11.4.24-9), which is also at the root of Poseidon's behaviour in II. 13-15, where he threatens open conflict should the plan not be fulfilled (II. 15.212-17); and Apollo's anger at Telphouse for her de- ception (HHAp. 375-87). Furthermore, Athene avoids helping Odysseus explicitly in order to avoid Poseidon's wrath lest he know that she has thwarted him (Od. 6.328-31, 13.341-3), which eventuality Zeus himself seems to feel some reluctance to bring about (Od. 1.68-79). When Here remonstrates with Zeus' bitter statements about the re-emergence of Achilleus on these terms (11.18.360-7), the theme of closely and jealously guarded divine plans seems to be buried deep within the conventions of the epic and the motivations of its divine characters. Fourthly, West notes that one deity making another swear an oath (II. 14.270-82) is found also in Atrahasis (2.383-8): The injured innocence of [Enki's] response (viz. to a demand for an oath from Ellil) ...may recall that of Hera when she swears a solemn oath to Zeus that it is not through any intention of hers that Poseidon has been attacking the Trojans and helping the Achaeans: it must have been his own idea.133 [my emphasis] The qualification in West's language is warranted, for the parallel is just not that close; Enki is refusing to swear an oath for which Ellil has asked (utterly unparalleled in divine contexts in early Greek epic), whilst Here proffers one to Zeus entirely unsolicited. Nor is it much closer to Hypnos' request to Here, for the status of the gods involved is inverted, and Here is readily persuaded to give the oath, because she is after all guaranteeing thereby a sug- gestion she herself had made (II. 14.267-9). Aside from this, con- sider also the importance and pervasiveness of oaths among the gods in early Greek epic.134 There are the direct parallels of Here demanding an oath from Zeus in Agamemnon's parable of Ate 133) West (as n. 3) 384, with swift reference to "pp. 181 " (sic), from which the following quote is taken, though there he discusses only Here's oath to Zeus at 11.15.36-46. 134) Cf. also above, pp. 290-292 and n. 108, for my response to Burkerťs version of this argument, specifically about Here's oath at II. 15.36f.</page><page sequence="39">The Babylonian Captivity of Homer 297 (II. 19.108-13),135 or Odysseus (though not a god, of course) ex- tracting one from Kalypso (Od. 5.177-91) and another (on Her- mes' advice) from Kirke (Od. 10.342-6), Délos from Leto (HHAp. 79-90), and Apollo from Hermes (HHHerm. 518-23), but we also find deities offering unsolicited oaths when they are under threat: Here to Zeus (II. 15.36-46), Skamandros to Here (11.21.373-6), Hermes to Apollo (HHHerm. 274-7) and so on. If this pattern is inherited from the Near East, and West's case is just not strong enough to make that conclusion compelling, then the responsible party was not the poet of the Iliad, for the divine oath is typical in the Greek context,136 and deeply assimilated within its tradition. Fifth, the very large fir tree on which Hypnos alights (II. 14.286-8) is compared by West to the biblical tower of Babel (Genesis 1.1.4), but also to the cedar in Gilgamesb whose 'crown pierces the sky' (5.6.6). West also points out another similarly gar- gantuan fir tree at Od. 5.239-40, from which inter al. Odysseus shapes his craft. The fir is generally lofty in real life and in Homer (and elsewhere),137 but two developed examples in Homeric epic cannot be much of an argument for typicality. Nonetheless, other physical features are described as 'coming into heaven' vel sim. - an expression more commonly used with sights and sounds etc.138 - from the pillars of Atlas which hold the earth apart (Od. 1.53-4), to Skylla's rock which oùpocvòv eùpùv kávei / ò£eír|i Kopucpfji (Od. 12.73-4), and the combination of Pelion and Ossa 135) West (as n.3) 181 links this episode with the oath in the Akkadian De- scent of Ishtar (c. 1100 ВС) which Ereshkigal is made to swear, unwittingly, about allowing Ishtar out of the Underworld (Dalley [as n. 12] 158). Again, however, the parallel is not that strong, for the characters and circumstances are different, and the number of Greek comparanda for requesting an oath, when taken together with the duplicitous nature of the relationship between Zeus and Here in early Greek epic, make it unlikely that an external source is required to explain the origin of Here's trick here. For another example of her interference in the birth of one of Zeus' (illicit) children, cf. HHAp. 95-106. 136) Ct. above, n. 108. 137) Cf. II. 5.560; J.

Such features are invoked exclusively in a divine context, where enormousness is a good and common thing, and so the generation of the motif is once more plausible within the Greek context. Finally, the very notion of the 'world tree', so tall that its branches reach into the sky or heaven, is such a common one in so many different traditions (and evidenced in the Indo- European tradition in the Norse Ash of Yggdrasil)139 that it would be unwise to use the motif for evidence of even the most indirect Near Eastern influence. As for West's sixth case, the similarity between the simile at Joel 2.5 and II. 14.394-401, a comparison of the texts reveals some rather notable differences: As with the noise of chariots отг ůaXáaaric кйцсс xóaov ßoaai лот! they dance on the mountain tops, x¿Paov&gt; TTOViótfev òpvúuevov rcvoifji Bopéo) atayeivfii, as with the noise of a flame of fire ome 7t')pòç xóoaoç ye noòi ßpo|i.oc devouring the stubble, aitìonévoio oupeoç év ßr|&lt;rcrr|ic, оте т' юрето raieuev X)Xr'v, like a mighty host drawn up out' ave^ioç xóaaov ye rcepi ôpualv for battle.140 ')'j/iKÓ|ioiaiv TjTTuei, oç те цаАлата iiéya ßpejiEiai XaXercaívcov, oacm apa Tpcócov ка!

In these two similes, the comparison is being made to different things (dancing in the Hebrew text, battlef-shouting] in the Greek) and to different groups (one in the Hebrew, two in Homer). Sec- ondly, there is no mention of chariots in the Greek text, which uses many more similes. Thirdly, the Hebrew does not link the fire with the mountain tops, as Homer does with the mountain glades in II. 14.396-7. Instead, the location of the fire in Joel is actually part of the main narrative ('they dance on the mountain tops'), and so separated from the second simile concerned with fire (cas with the noise of a flame of fire devouring the stubble'). This is not 139) Cf. West (as n.20) 345-7; also, e.g., M.Eliade, Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy (New York 1964) 269-74. 140) Joel is quoted as in West (as n. 3) 384.</page><page sequence="41">The Babylonian Captivity of Homer 299 such a close parallel after all. Consider also that such cumulated similes are typical in Homeric narrative and so a traditional fea- ture,141 as is the image of a fire in the hills,142 and the location of simile activity oupeoç èv ßr|oar|ic (II. 14.397). 143 Inheritance, even influence, on this point is most unlikely. Similarly explicable, i. e. primarily within the 'Gleichnistypik' of Greek epic, is the simile describing Here's journey (II. 15.80-3), West's severely qualified144 seventh case, for comparison of jour- neys to dreams and / or thought is well exampled in early Greek epic,145 and usually confined to the journeys of deities, with the special abilities of the Phaiakian ship in the Odyssey not being much of an exception, given their somewhat ambiguous status on the margins of human society. The Egyptian story, by contrast, uses the simile in the mouth of Sinuhe to explain to the Pharaoh why he had fled Egypt. The differences between the examples, as well as the theme's traditionality within the Greek setting, surely render it unlikely that the image is derived directly or indirectly from this Egyptian text, or indeed any other. Eighth, the mission pattern for Here's despatch to Olympos is apparently found in Akkadian epic, but West has slightly mis- characterised the Homeric passage: [t]he father of the gods tells god В to fetch god C, who is then sent as a messenger with instructions for god D.146 However, in the DA Zeus sends Here (B) to fetch Iris and Apol- lo (Ca and Cb), each of whom is then despatched on separate mis- sions, Iris to Poseidon (Da) and Apollo to Hektor (Db). The pat- tern is repeated in Book 24 when Zeus sends Iris (B) to summon Thetis (C) to Zeus on Olympos, so that he can instruct her to jour- ney to the Greek camp and give instructions to Achilleus (D).147 In 141) Cf.

In the only cited Near East- ern parallel passage - from the Standard Babylonian Version of Anzu (7th с. ВС) - the pattern is confined to gods and happens once (III 40 f.).148 A readier explanation for these Homeric loci is that they are a variation of Homer's usual ABC pattern, in which Zeus sends a god (B) directly either to another god or, more usually, a mortal (C).149 The extra step (D) is required in the DA because of Zeus' absence from Olympos, i. e. the poet's decision to focus on the separation of Zeus from the other gods,150 and in Iliad 24 be- cause Achilleus is to be afforded the signal and individual honour of being informed of the gods' will by his mother.151 In other words, the particular requirements of the Homeric situations sug- gest the addition of another figure to the ABC pattern. I suggest, then, that the 'parallel' with Anzu is entirely coincidental, given that there is an excellent reason within the conventions of Greek epic for Homer to have varied his usual practice in these three places. Finally, there seems little point in comparing Athene's rebuke to Ares (on the grounds that r' vx&gt; toi ouncoç cmax' ocKo')é|iev èoxí II. 15.128) with the proverbial 'ears to hear' in the Hebrew prophets, because (aside from the fact that the Bible postdates Homer) there are ready and numerous Homeric parallels for a character's bewildering failure to use a physical facility or oppor- tunity. Consider Odysseus' comment that Antinoos does not show the sense which should go with his physical form (Od. 17.454 co полог, oi)K ара coi y' èrci eïôei ка1 (ppeveç fjaav), or Diomedes' re- buke of Agamemnon's unleaderly behaviour despite the grant of his authority from Zeus (11.9.37-9 croi ôè ôuxvôi%a осоке Kpóvoi) patched to fetch other heroes, but the narrative only follows Nestor as he summons Odysseus (Ca) and then Diomedes (Cb), who are then sent on the same mission to summon others (D). 148) Cf.Dalley(asn.l2)218-19. 149) Cf. 11.2.3-36, 4.69-104, 11.185-210 (Zeus is similarly absent from Olympos here, but Iris is always assumed to be at his beck and call; cf.

Here is depicted as initially compliant to Zeus' wishes, but her arrival on Olympos still manages to foment Ares to an almost suicidal act of rebellion. 151) Ct. 11.24.110-11; also 59-61, 66, 71-3.</page><page sequence="43">The Babylonian Captivity of Homer 301 rcocîç àyK'u^oiLiriTecû- / окт|лтрсо1 jaiv xoi боке xexi'ir'GŮai rcepi TcávTcov, / (xXktiv 6' ou toi ôôkev, о те кратос écrcì [léyiGTov),152 whilst to describe a failure of this sort as possession oikœç can be seen in Glaukos' rebuke of Hektor (11.17.143 T| a' mrccoç kAÍoç eaůXbv e%ei &lt;pofy]kiv èóvTa) and Artemis' scolding of Apollo for his refusal to fight (11.21.474 vr'nmi£, xi vu to^ov ë^eiç ocvejico^iov ocotcûç;).153 Crucially, Theoklymenos deploys to the suitors pre- cisely the same motif as Athene did to Ares, but to the opposite conclusion, linking his own possession of these faculties directly with his good sense (Od. 20.365-8 eiaí jioi ò(pi}aX|j,oí те кос! ovaia ка1 rcóôeç ajicpco / mi vóoç èv axr'ůeoai Teruyijivoç, o')ôèv àeucriç* / toíç e^eijLii uúpaÇe, èrcel voéco micòv u^jaiv / èp%ó|xevov). Again, the Greek context explains the origin of this motif, and so argues against recent derivation from the Near East, or indeed any ob- servable trace of this process whatsoever. This litany of pedantry has gone on long enough, particular- ly because West's (usual) refusal to make Burkert's claims of a more direct interference or influence prevents his general conclusions from being totally undermined by the type of counterargument de- ployed here. Indeed, it is impossible to challenge the broader form of his basic thrust, that early Greek poetry is suffused with motifs and themes to be found in many other texts and cultures, from a wide range of periods and places, and that they are all witnesses to an interlocking nexus of traditions whose contents and dynamics are largely irrecoverable. Yet caution is required even in this 'soft' version of contem- porary orientalism. Many of the parallels are simply not close enough to warrant the term; many others can be explained as in- dependent generations of similar motifs; and the remainder argue for a very indirect form of influence, in which the antiquity of any putative inheritance has allowed the motif to be thoroughly assim- ilated to its Hellenic context. This last point, of course, actually helps to demonstrate the interrelatedness of these Mediterranean and West Asiatic traditions, so I am far from asserting that there is 152) Cf. also, e.g., 11.3.44-5; 6.521-3 (both on Paris' inability to live up to his natural gifts and position as leader of the Trojans); Od. 8.165-77, esp. 176-7: œç mi aoì eiÔoç nèv àpuipercéç, o')Ôé kev &amp;'Хщ I oi)ôè uebç xeí^eie, vóov 5' àiio- (pcoÀióç ¿aai (~ II. 15.129b vóoç Ô' апбХшХг mi aiÔcoç). 153) Cf. 11.17.143,21.474.</page><page sequence="44">302 Adrian Kelly no relationship to be discovered. But I am not convinced that vast lists of parallels are actually that useful or illuminating, without some methodological consideration or categorisation of those fea- tures and the dynamics which produced them. It is perhaps unfair to criticise West for not doing everything for us, and the East Face will remain an indispensible reference work for every Homerist, but his own preferences in the exercise are clear from the conclud- ing sentences of his book: The testy critic may complain that there are too many 'might haves' and not enough indisputable 'must haves'. But mathematically rigor- ous demonstrations cannot be expected in these matters. It is a ques- tion of defining and weighing possibilities and probabilities. Each read- er must judge, case by case, which of the various situations suggested as I favourable for transmission are merely remotely conceivable hy- potheses, and which are to be admitted as historically likely to have arisen. I hope to have shown that some, at least, fall into the latter cat- egory. In the final reckoning, however, the argument for pervasive West Asiatic influence on early Greek poetry does not stand or fall with explanations of how it came about. A corpse suffices to prove a death, even if the inquest is in- conclusive.154 [my emphasis] This testy critic wonders whether the analogy cannot be put to bet- ter use; two corpses may bear an essential and important similarity to one another, but their deaths may well be completely unrelated. Inquests remain important. 5. Conclusion In the course of this article, we have encountered both 'hard' and 'soft' forms of orientalism applied to the relationship between the DA and the traditions of the ancient Near East. The former, principally followed by Burkert, seeks to use the Near Eastern texts in much the same way that, e. g., Neoanalysts use the frag- ments of the epic cycle, focusing on apparent problems or individ- ualities in the DA as evidence of the poet's (or at the most a very near ancestor's) dependence on external sources. The latter, exem- plified in this case above all by the catalogues of West, compiles overwhelming lists of parallels, from a vast range of texts, in order 154) West (as n. 3)629-30.</page><page sequence="45">The Babylonian Captivity of Homer 303 to show that the Homeric tradition was one of a range of interre- lated poetic traditions which flourished in Greece and the ancient Near East from the early Bronze Age into the post-classical peri- od. On the arguments presented in this article, Burkert's strategy is indefensible, while West's conclusion is so general as to render it extremely probable. Nonetheless, there are several reasons to approach both de- ployments of Near Eastern material with caution. Firstly, what looks like a parallel need not be one at all, as with the case of cos- mogonie Okeanos.155 In order to avoid such misidentifications in the future, each feature therefore needs to be located properly within its own tradition. If the feature can be situated within the Greek context, and I submit that there is nothing in the DA which cannot, there arises in every case the possibility that the parallel is fortuitous, and can be explained as well or even better by reference to the dynamics of that context, as e. g. with the divine lot, Hypnos' Hephaistian stool or the divine ABCD pattern.156 In- deed, even when a plausible case for adaptation can be advanced, the contextualisation of the feature will suggest that any such mo- ment or process was of such antiquity that it explains very little about the form or function of the motif in the Homeric setting, as e. g. with the dressing scene, or the catalogue of Zeus' lovers (and perhaps the divine lot).157 In short, this review of the orientalist arguments on this por- tion of the poem suggests that there is no reason to believe that the DA is a foreign element within the Iliad, or that it requires or even asks for the invocation of non-Greek material in order to make sense of its narrative. The communis opinio on this passage is therefore mistaken, and the DA should no longer be described sim- ply as 'an oriental episode'. It is certainly no more 'oriental', and no less Homeric, than any other section of the Iliad, or indeed ear- ly Greek epic poetry in general. Such a conclusion might lead the reader to infer that, in the opinion of the author, there is no utility in invoking or even study- 155) Cf. above, pp. 274-280. 156) Cf. above (in order), pp.262ff., 294 f., 299 f. 157) Cf. above (in order), pp.294, 289 f., 262 ff. If the reader remains uncon- vinced by the alternative explanations offered for the other features discussed above, this last qualification would still apply, for the contextualisation of the fea- ture should at least have shown how meaningful it is in a Greek setting.</page><page sequence="46">304 Adrian Kelly ing the ancient Near East in an Homeric context. On the contrary, there is an important purpose to comparative studies, in that they can illuminate the entirety of the poetic nexus within which the Greek epic tradition developed. But we cannot use our very partial picture of the Near Eastern traditions as an excuse for an exercise in direct - or even indirect - 'Quellenforschung'. For all the criticisms advanced in this article, it is a lasting achievement of orientalism to have shown that the Greeks were not autochthonous; that many of the patterns, themes and aspirations which strike us so powerfully about early Greek culture were part of a broader current of civilisation in the Mediterranean basin whose roots stretch back well into the Bronze Age. We can no longer treat Hellenic culture in a vacuum, but we should not for that reason throw out every appliance hitherto at our disposal. If, because of our new respect for the Near Eastern traditions, we do not treat the Greek texts with the respect they deserve, then we run the risk of oversimplifying them both.
