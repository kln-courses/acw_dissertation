<plain_text><page sequence="1">W. H. Auden. The Prolific and the Devourer. Edward Mendelson, ed. New York. Ecco. 1981. 87 pages. $5.95. Auden was hardly a critic and observer of his own creative practice who wallowed in contradictions or poetic bewilder- ment. He was sententious, even dictatorial about his own work and often devastating about that of others. The Prolific and the Devourer is not along these lines at all; it is a book of aphorisms and reflections which, in the words of the editor Edward Mendelson (his literary executor and author of Early Auden, see WLT 56:2, p. 345), finds the poet "at a moment of transition between his equivocal Marxism in the 1930s and his committed Christianity in the 1940s." The editor alleges that Auden probably abandoned the book because of "his discontent with its mandarin style." At any rate, it is the compelling documentation of an Auden that was carefully hidden from view while he was alive, the portrait of a poet "between two masters," as it were, moving away from the mordant satire, protest and trendy social concerns (including his collaborations with Benjamin Britten) and on to a new concept of the relationship between the poet and society at large. The fundamental perception in these diaries is the recognition that the artist and the politician are enemies, "i.e. that each has a vision of the world which must remain incomprehensible to the other." This in turn reflects Auden's rejection of dualism, dialectic and leftover Manichean propensities, and his turn toward the idea that the example of Jesus and His prophecies gave to man the ideal of communal Agape, that "it is the nature of the particular biological species to which you belong ... to love your neighbor. " Thus the possibility envisaged in The Prolific and the Devourer of attaining a non-anthropomorphic Truth, that there is only one kind of freedom, "the freedom to know the truth, which, when you once know it, you must either obey or perish." A modest and mighty little book. J . A. Coleman</page></plain_text>
