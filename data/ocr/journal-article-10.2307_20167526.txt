<plain_text><page sequence="1">Astonishment and stickiness in Kongo art A theoretical advance WYATT MACGAFFEY The idea of art is critically bound up with the idea we form of civilization. Much of the discussion about what art is and what it means is not really about art at all; it uses the topic and the content of art to campaign for particular definitions of what it is to be civilized, and it changes in tandem with the political concerns of the period. I review this history briefly before turning to a theory of art that promises escape from the invidious distinctions built into the idea, without abandoning it altogether. The theory is the work of the late Alfred Gell (Gell 1998). The modern idea of "art," in contrast to artifact, is fairly recent in Western thought; the date of the first use of the word in its modern sense is given by the OED as 1668, shortly after the founding of the Royal Academy in Paris in 1648 marked the professionalization of Fine Art under the control of the state.1 Art at this time was expected to uphold public morality by depicting edifying moments from history and mythology, and great or at least wealthy men and women. The "theory" of this art, the classical ideal, is developed during the eighteenth century by such figures as Vico, Burke, Lessing, and Kant, all of whom are preoccupied with the relations among art, morality and right thinking.2 The fact that a categorical distinction was and is made between art and artifact, artist and artisan, does not mean, of course, that there was then, or is now, general agreement as to which is which. The importance of the distinction is that it focuses argument about how resources should be allocated: how the producer should be rewarded with money and renown, where the product should be housed, and with what vocabulary the public should be instructed in the proper response to it. For example: Albert Paley was at one time a blacksmith, but he decided to become an artist and began to produce work that he intended as pure sculpture, without functional or even ornamental purpose. After he had achieved recognition as an artist, critics began to label retroactively the things he used to make?tables, plant stands, massive gates?as "functional sculpture."3 Another example: in 1990, when the performance artist Annie Sprinkle put on a show in Cleveland called "Post-Post Porn Modernist," she was forbidden by the municipal vice squad to do some of the things she had been allowed to do in her role as a live sex-show performer before she became an "artist." Damien Hirst's career shows that one cannot tell by looking at a dead cow whether it belongs in an abattoir or an art gallery. The job of the anthropologist is not to adjudicate such categorical differences but to note how they are argued and what are the consequences. The idea of Art, like that of the rational, has always been most clearly defined by what it is not or, more accurately, by whatever lack in other people explains the assumed absence of civilization among them. Its eighteenth century development was encouraged by increasing interest in reports from exotic places, and accompanied the differentiation of anthropology and other social sciences from philosophy and theology, in which their concerns had hitherto been embedded. The classical norm in art, as Frances Connelly has shown, "cast the primitive as the dark image of itself" (Connelly 1995:9). Primitives, motivated solely by impulse and emotion, were incapable of conceptual abstraction from sensual experience and lacked any sense of history. Instead of Art, they produced forms that were either grotesque (lacking discipline) or, at best, ornamental (lacking narrative). The type of the grotesque was the 1. According to the OED, the usual modern sense of art, "the skilful production of the beautiful in visible forms," does not occur in any English dictionary before 1880; before that it was used chiefly by painters and writers on painting. 2. In recent times, Clement Greenberg declared that the mission of modern art was to save civilization from the onslaught of kitsch; the Minimalists strove to get rid of illusions and virtual realities: "The implicit analogy between works of art and their viewers had to be undone, in the Minimalist view, because the distinction between the animate and the inanimate, between active, responsible beings and inert ones, is an obvious first principle for an effort to see and think about the world clearly"(Baker 1988:36). 3. The Philadelphia Inquirer, 4 April 1991.</page><page sequence="2">138 RES 39 SPRING 2001 "fetish," especially as it was reported from Africa and Oceania; for Enlightenment thinkers from De Brosses to Hegel, "fetishism" was the antithesis of civilization (Pietz 1985). The primitive peoples whose random impulses generated fetishes violated the elementary Cartesian distinction between animate and inanimate beings by crediting their own fabrications with intention. On the other hand, the ornamental, particularly in the court arts of the Near and Far East and Peru, was regarded by many as at least a step towards the production of "real" or representational art.4 In the mid-nineteenth century, the romantic reaction against the academy and the classical ideal brought about a r??valuation of emotion as against reason, and therefore of the primitive. Ornament became more respectable; the possibility that primitive arts were really Art, or art of a sort, acquired plausibility. The last quarter of the nineteenth century also discovered, or invented, Folk Art, to which most of the same ambiguities attach as to Primitive Art; in practice, it consisted of objects identified as art by members of the upper class.5 Folk, primitive, and found objects could suddenly be Art, often considered morally preferable, somehow, to "academic art," but the idea of them remained negative, a "dark image."6 These turns of thought and practice have generated the subdivisions of the general category, Art, that prevailed until recently and have yet to succumb entirely to scholarly challenges. The Fine Art of Others is limited, so far, to Oriental Art, no longer regarded as primitive (and recently relabeled Asian Art in recognition of the invidious nature of the original distinction). Primitive Art is the Folk Art of Others who lack Fine Art. The constitutive variables of the set are "ours versus theirs" and "higher versus lower"; the significance of each category, and of "Art" as a whole, lies in the way it is contrasted with the others, rather than in the list of objects that may or may not be included. Objects of each kind are normally housed in museums specializing in them and supported by the corresponding specialized journals and professional associations. The public, even though unable to define Art or Folk Art or Primitive Art, knows what to expect in collections bearing these labels, and has been instructed at some level in the nature of the experience they should have when visiting one. Whether these contrasts should be drawn, and where, are matters of ongoing debate, often attended by the acrimony appropriate to these and other essentially political matters, and energized by the desire to control (commercial) value. As Fred Myers observes, "the point of the struggle is almost entirely a question of how to represent others" (Myers 1995:57). When acrylic paintings by Australian Aborigines appeared on the New York art market in 1989, dealers and their allies the critics debated the status to be accorded to them. Myers identified three critical positions: the romantic, in which the paintings, created in industrial media rather than with vegetable dyes on bark, failed as primitive art because they had been contaminated by Western influence; the modernist, in which they also failed as modern art, because by its standards they were no more than second-rate neo-Expressionism; and the self described "post-modernist" perspective (incorporating some old-fashioned Marxist rhetoric), which denied that the works should be called art at all. "Such criticisms," Myers notes, "are part of the discursive practices that define 'high art'"; they are also about how we see "ourselves" in relation to "them" (Myers 1995:81). Faced with audiences committed to this set of categories and the values they embody, in dealing with 4. The history of these evaluations remains fossilized in the categories we find in dealers' catalogues and the art departments of museums, where Africa and Oceania are lumped together only because, in the twentieth century, they were the last areas to be admitted as potential producers of Art. Museums devoted to ornament and design, such as the one that became the Victoria and Albert, were originally ridiculed, and today still it is often considered improper for an "art" museum to exhibit, say, motorcycles. 5. The term "folklore" itself was coined in 1846; folklore societies were founded in Britain in 1878 and in America in 1888. Curry suggests that perhaps the best definition of "American folk art" is that it is stuff collected as such in the early 20th century by people with certain attitudes (Curry 1987). A silk-stocking voice heard on a recent radio broadcast declared that Folk Art is produced by people outside the mainstream, isolated from metropolitan ideas, and indeed innocent of the idea of art itself; "they do not know that the things they make are art; we have to tell them." 6. Anderson's quite recent characterization is explicitly residual: "We need the term 'primitive art' because non-primitive societies typically have art based on complex technology; art training is institutionalized in schools; artists tend to be full time specialists; there is great diversity of art styles; art styles change rapidly over time" (Anderson 1979:6). The collectors and connoisseurs who constitute the primitive art market codify tribal styles in order to control "authenticity" and therefore market value; they consider objects made by known and still living individual makers to be inauthentic (Steiner 1994). These views are changing, as recent studies reveal the presence of art schools, individual masters, and training programs in the space once occupied by the blandly fallacious construction of the Primitive.</page><page sequence="3">MacGaffey: Astonishment and stickiness in Kongo art 1 39 Kongo "fetishes" regarded nowadays as "art," I, like many others in a similar situation, have challenged them with descriptive arguments. I have explained that the objects available to look at have been reduced from original totalities by processes of selection, collection and display; that the complexities of the objects, evidently conforming nevertheless to the requirements of a genre, cannot be accounted for as random products of the imagination; that our perception of the objects is governed by expectations of which we may not be aware; and that the Kongo attitude towards fetishes is not all that different from the gallery-goer's attitude to art. What I lacked was a theory (MacGaffey 1998; MacGaffey and Harris 1993). In anthropology, theory is supposed to transcend description and allow us to escape at least to some extent the cultural conditions in which our ideas are produced. Anthropologists do set great store by theory, but history shows that "theory" is usually, at best, an approximate descriptive model of some set of factors supposed to be recognizable in the world; often it is not much more than a political agenda wrapped in pretentious language.7 It should rather consist in an interdependent set of terms so defined as to enable us to be clear about what we mean, and to move easily from one cultural context to another without a priori commitment to any of them. Such a theory is evaluated in the first place for its internal cogency; secondly, for its usefulness: does it produce elegant results? "Results," of course, will be measured in relation to the purpose of our endeavor. Alfred Gell sweeps aside the supposed problem of the irrational attribution of animacy to objects by people other than ourselves by accepting it as a universal tendency. Like its contemporary, totemism, fetishism was invented to separate primitive institutions from our own, when comparison revealed too many embarrassing affinities (which Marx and Freud later dwelt upon) (L?vi Strauss 1963:103). Gell notes that any object may acquire "agency" as a function of its implication in relations between persons; things, whether "representational" or not, acquire attributes of personhood in social situations.8 This move also enables him to relate his proposed anthropology of art to social anthropology in general, which is distinctive in its biographical focus on "the life projects which agents seek to realize through their relations with others."9 He rejects the usual sociological, aesthetic and semiotic approaches on the grounds that they are inappropriate, ethnocentric and non-anthropological, borrowed from other disciplines (Gell 1998:5-8; Layton 1991:4; MacGaffey 1998:218-219; Bourdieu 1990; Morphy 1994:648-685). Provisionally, the anthropology of art is to be the theoretical study of "social relations in the vicinity of objects mediating social agency." We attribute agency to persons and objects by "abduction," a type of syllogism which everybody employs everyday to "read" the environment; abduction is not a product of tautologies, as in mathematics, nor of conventions, as in language, but a "reasonable" inference from a sign (index) of a cause or motivation, an agency. For example, we routinely read smoke as a sign of fire, and a smile as an index of friendly intentions, although we know that smiles can deceive and that what looks like smoke can proceed from other sources than fire. This sort of inference, unreliable though it is, allows us to function in our environment by limiting the likely explanations of any event. Agency, the ability to cause things to happen, can be of many different kinds, including but certainly not limited to the aesthetic agency which is the usual focus of art theory. The theory restricts art-like situations to those in which a material index permits the abduction of specifically social agency, implying an act of mind or intention, and therefore excludes "natural" causes and their effects. The concept of agency is essentially relational: for any agent (in a given transaction) there is a patient, although this relationship is reversible. The work of art (index) is a patient with respect to the artist who made it, but an agent with respect to the "recipient," the spectator who is moved by it (p. 22). We can make a 7. An example is functionalism, which showed, in opposition to the views prevailing in the 1920s, that primitive societies were not social failures but "worked" in their own way. Functionalism generated an impressive body of good work before its internal incoherence became obvious. Discussing the need to make theory explicit (including the theory that we should keep to pure description), P. McNaughton points out that art history is rife with "naturalizing ideologies" (McNaughton 1993). 8. This argument was offered long ago by G. H. Mead in his discussion of the "conversation of gestures," in which inanimate objects may acquire social roles (Mead 1934:154n, 253-254). 9. Gell, p. 11. The anthropological tradition is that associated with the work of Marcel Mauss.</page><page sequence="4">140 RES 39 SPRING 2001 distinction between primary (human) agents and "secondary" (artifactual) agents through which humans distribute their own agency in a causal milieu, but the distinction is not as radical as Cartesian logic would expect. To act socially is always to realize one's agency through objects?weapons, clothes, the body?which are objective embodiments of the capacity to will their use; secondary agency has some primary agent "behind" it. The agency of the artist, abducted from the index (artwork), is essential to the system; a crude index in whose manufacture nobody takes any interest is not significant as a "work of art," whereas objects credited with miraculous origins, no matter how crude their appearance, are at least "art-like" within the terms of the system (p. 68). Placing any object in a situation requiring special behavior towards it, as in ritual or in a museum, immediately raise questions of agency that might not arise in another context. Ordinary tools are not works of art, because we find nothing interesting in their manufacture; old tools, and even old cars, however, become "antiques" and even art-works when, with a little encouragement from the way in which they are displayed, we marvel at the bygone craftsmanship that produced them.10 The last component in the network of relations that defines art is the prototype, that which "causes" the art object to be what it is, and which it therefore "represents." Representation takes many forms, not only visual or "realistic"; for example, the aniconic image of a god in the form of a stone represents the presence of the god in that place, rather than his appearance (p. 26). We will return to such stones later on. We thus have a system in four terms, a hierarchy of agency: Prototype -* Artist [maker] -* Index -&gt; Recipient, which can, for example, be read as: "Prototype inspires artist to make artwork which acts upon a public." This reading fits the usual idea of the making of art, but many others are comprehended, such as: "Ancestor instructs descendant to construct shrine for the family." An art object is not something that fits a given description but "whatever is inserted into the 'slot' provided for objects in the system of terms and relations envisaged in the theory," in this instance, an index permitting the abduction of agency. All of these terms can be both agent and patient; Gell provides a table of the four terms and the simple (binary) relations of agent or patient which can obtain among them, with examples, some quite surprising (there are 36 possible relations). In given instances, artist, recipient and prototype may be absent or only ambiguously present, but the index of agency ("art object") is indispensable. The table generates a number of "illegitimate relationships," for example, one in which the artist as "agent" generates the prototype. This seems unlikely but is in fact the general formula for "imaginary" images such as William Blake's sketch, "The ghost of a flea," but not for a painting of a unicorn, which, though imaginary, is conventional. There is no prototype for the ghost of a flea, therefore nothing is indexed by the sketch, but the formula enables us to state exactly what the relationship is between this art-like situation and others (p. 38). One of the more interesting situations, to which we will return, is that in which an index can be seen as the "cause" of itself; specifically, when the relations among the parts of an artifact are understood as in tension with one another in such as way as to give the appearance of energy at work.11 The formula "Prototype -&gt; Maker -&gt; Index -? Recipient" is in fact what one normally assumes to be the network of relations obtaining in the vicinity of art objects, but its abstract, rather than descriptive, form allows Gell to move immediately to the analysis of agency in a piece of "primitive art," a Kongo nkisi (pi. minkisi) of the type called "nail-fetish" (nkondi). Although he relies exclusively on a brief report written by a trader a century ago, his analysis is correct. A supplicant (as agent) provokes the fetish (as patient) which then, as agent, causes the death of the victim, an unknown "witch" (ndoki). But there are other killings 10. In practice, Gell seems to restrict his discussion of art to objects implicated in the central values and political relations of the society that produces or displays them. That limitation admits an nkondi as made and used in its original context; the same object exhibited as African Art; high fashion; certain automobiles in certain contexts; decorated latmul lime-containers (p. 74); historical relics and sites; and Van Eyck's "Adoration of the Lamb" as and when viewed by either art-lovers or the religiously devout. Elsewhere he says, in the spirit of Duchamp, that he would want to accept as candidates for art status only objects that reward scrutiny by embodying complex and demanding intentional ?ties (Gell 1999:211). 11. Gell, p. 43. This idea of agency as internal to the visual index has been elaborated in the cognitive psychology of Rudolf Arnheim (Arnheim 1974). Other situations examined by Gell include The Picture of Dorian Gray, an Asmat shield from New Guinea, Rigaud's portrait of Louis XIV, an Ndembu ritual from Zambia, and a pyramid of Chinese acrobats.</page><page sequence="5">MacGaffey: Astonishment and stickiness in Kongo art 141 involved in the necessary prior agential step: the nganga who makes the original image does so by cutting down a tree and killing a chicken, causing the death of a hunter who has himself been successful in killing game and whose captive soul subsequently animates the figure (fig. 1). The figure is thus, as Gell says, an index of cumulative agency, a visible knot tying together an invisible skein of spatio-temporal relations of which the participants in the ritual are well aware. The situation is much more interesting than an image of suffering patienthood, on the model of the European sorcerer's pins stuck in a wax image, or a St. Sebastian by Mantegna or Pinturicchio (fig. 2). Gell shows the relationships in the form of a tree structure, which is more perspicuous than a formula when we are dealing with complex situations. He illustrates his analysis with two nkondi figures from the British Museum, but does not make use of his own method to illuminate the visible features of such figures. The figures are not images of the target, as most people take them to be, nor of the retributive force that is activated by ritual ly invoking one, but composite representations of both, and thus of the relationship between them (MacGaffey 2000a:113). The "prototype" of an nkondi figure is a particular set of retributive capacities, not a personality that looks like the thing itself, even if it is anthropomorphic. This is exactly what his analysis of multiple agency shows. The original spectators would also have been aware of a third agential sequence: the nganga would have been instructed in the composition of the nkondi, perhaps in a dream, by a particular spirit.12 Later arguments in the book can be used to explain the effect of yet other features of this and other nkondi, although Gell does not refer again to this particular example.13 An nkondi is "animate," in that it is supposed to respond to invocations. "Personhood" in an object can be created by the way we behave towards it, where "behavior" includes not only speeches and gestures but a setting, such as a temple or museum, appropriate to persons of social importance. It can also be suggested by visually creating the possibility that, like a human being, it has within it a hidden anima; Gell calls this the internalist or "homunculus" theory of animation (p. 135). He illustrates the principle by referring to reliquaries and other images, intended for cult use, which open up to reveal interiors, often with figures in them. In elaborate examples, a series of layers gives the impression of penetrating into yet deeper mysteries, the more impressive in that they may be ultimately unattainable.14 Interiority and the sense of a potent mystery within may be visually suggested in nkondi by a number of devices, including impressive workmanship. The agency of the artist in making the artwork impresses us, Gell argues, because, as human beings, we all could be artists and therefore identify with those who are, while admitting that the difference between what we might produce and the work we admire has something "magical" about it. Highly ornate Trobriand canoe prow boards are intended so to impress the makers' trading partners that they will be convinced of the inferiority of their own powers and consequently unable to drive hard bargains. What Trobrianders call magic is what we call genius; in Kongo, it arouses "astonishment" (ngitukulu). An elaborately carved hair-do on an nkisi was not necessary to detect witches or cure headaches, but sculptures admired for their art made better m/n/c/s/.15 Unimaginable virtuosity generates captivation or fascination because the spectator is trapped within the indecipherable agency of the index (Gell 1998:71; Freedberg 1989:49). The idea of the "agency" apparent in the form of the artwork leads to a discussion of ornament or decoration, considered in the nineteenth century to be primitive proto-art. Decoration "fails" as art because it lacks a prototype as the agent behind it, but the dynamic of part-whole relations in the pattern makes objects come alive, though in a non-representational way (p. 76). Although the mathematics of repetition, rotation and the 12. For example, an nkondi called Mbola (MacGaffey 2000:chap. 7). 13. It is not necessary or desirable to write out either the formula or the tree-structure in any given instance; they are needed only to explain the method. In the book, Gell proceeds from nkondi to an analysis of Mary Richardson's notorious slashing of the Rokeby Venus of Velazquez, showing systematically how the sequence of agencies implicit in her work made it an effective (disturbing) feminist statement. 14. Parallel effects are achieved by dealers in African art, who admit favored clients to the "treasures" of the inner sanctum; by Dogon guides, who lead tourists into increasingly "unknown" areas; and by the successive initiations undergone by Baktaman men in New Guinea (Barth 1975; Rachel Hofman, in Nooter 1993:228; Steiner 1994). 15. Zo? Strother, discussing a Pende chief's adze, says its appearance adds to the chief's "style," lulendo lua mfumu (pers. comm.). The word she translates as "style" in this context means "power"; the two concepts are closely related.</page><page sequence="6">142 RES 39 SPRING 2001 Cnnijo. W, I i. Figure 1. Kongo Nkisi nkondi.

Inner energy endows the decorated object with a type of agency which is the reciprocal of the agency exercised by the recipient in attempting to follow it. This seductive quality in ornament has often prompted moralizing authorities in Europe to condemn it, sometimes on explicitly religious grounds. Many decorative patterns make use of this effect to ward off evil: mazes, Celtic knotwork, Tamil threshold designs, and the sand drawings of the Malekula in the New Hebrides. The eyes of ghosts, demons and other dangerous strangers are supposed to be so taken with the insolubility of such designs that they are distracted from their nefarious intent. Gell calls the effect "cognitive stickiness" (p. 86).16 Designs also convey an impression of inner energy by asymmetry and discontinuity, causing parts of the design to seem to be pressing for balance in the whole. This well-known effect, confirmed by experimental research in cognitive psychology, has been reported with respect to textiles from several areas of Africa (Adams 1989). The makers of such textiles regard them as powerful and as containing "secrets." In Central Africa, textile patterns may also be used as surface decoration on wooden objects; the patterns themselves may have "meanings" of a narrative kind, but it is surely the visual effect itself which conveys the sense of mysterious agency.17 The Kongo kunda bell, used to invoke the powers of the dead to effect healing, refers by its double end and double clappers to mediation between visible events among the living and their unseen causes in the otherworld, the land of the dead, which inverts the land of the living (MacGaffey 1986:chap. 2). The fine example shown in figure 3a makes this mediation explicit by showing, on one bell, the figure of a seated man, evidently important, wearing imported clothes and holding the conventional wine jug and cup of an elder Figure 2.

The history of European ?conoclasm extends from Plato through the Church Fathers to Benjamin and Barthes; ?t ?s built into art theory from the eighteenth century to the present, and resulted in the destruction of innumerable works of art not only in Europe but in Africa, Polynesia, and other areas incorporated in European empires (Freedberg 1989; Mitchell 1986). 17.

On the back of this bell is the figure of a woman, his wife, whose hands draw attention to her breasts in order to make her gender clear (fig. 3b). Opposite the chief, but on the other bell (associated, we know, with the dead) another figure shows a man in a constraining frame, his coffin or his grave; he may be the chief himself after his death, buried upright or in a sitting position facing the village he ruled in life (fig. 3a). Opposite the wife is a counterpart figure, also constrained, posed not frontally but in a position that suggests a slave, arms behind his back, buried with the chief (fig. 3b).

"Healing" on Kongo is a matter of combating dangerous social and spiritual influences; as Gell says, "Wherever one finds conflict there one finds abundant deployment of all kinds of decorative art" (Gell 1998:83). Stickiness explains, or at least illuminates, a number of features of Kongo art objects, notably those to be seen in nkondi and other apotropaic minkisi, whose surfaces, though not patterned, are distinctively complex.18 Minkisi are always ensembles of materials signifying, by their names, their appearance or their associations, the powers attributed to the whole. They take the form of a container, whether a bag, a wooden figure, a pot or some other hollow thing, to which are added tightly packed "medicines" on the inside and, often, a vast number of attachments on the outside: cords, rags, figurines, feathers, seeds, and pieces of iron. (The idea of "the abduction of agency" can scarcely be better illustrated than by the disturbing energies of a wooden figure stuck full of nails.) Each component earns its place by a logic I have discussed elsewhere; what concerns me here is the visual effect of this superabundance (MacGaffey 2000a; MacGaffey and Harris 1993). The additions sometimes include basketwork. Miniature rat traps are easily explained, because witches are to be "trapped," but I have long been puzzled by trefoil objects resembling old-fashioned wicker carpet beaters in miniature. I now see that these are "visual traps." The verb for entrapment is kanga, "to arrest, tie up"; it is represented by nets, crossed sticks, and other crossed forms. Knot-work turns up repeatedly in minkisi, in the form for example of the nest of the weaver-bird, which may also be buried at the edge of a village to trap witches. Nkisi Nkubulu, which treats smallpox, consists of a cluster of little bags, each tightly knotted in its own net (MacGaffey and Harris 1993:63). The "stickiness" of minkisi, however, and thus the sense that there are "forces" at work, is created less by these details than by the sheer complexity of accumulated business. As M. Nooter observes, strategies of accumulation and containment are implicitly linked; containment gives the impression that something may be hidden inside, and accumulation adds obscurity to make the secrecy evident (MacGaffey and Harris 1993frontispiece and pis. 43, 55; Nooter 1993:51 -52).19 The "prototype" of an nkisi is the object itself, transmitting to the viewer a sense of its own inner agency; it is not a representation of something else. Animacy is also suggested by equipping a figure with eyes (Freedberg 1989:52, 202; Gell 1998:149-152). The "eyes" of many minkisi take the form of mirrors fixed on their bodies, which enable a diviner to "see" the direction from which danger comes. In a mirror one is both observed and observer, but to look in a mirror is to see something that is not there but elsewhere. Kongo rituals are intended to discover and defeat unseen dangers that bear upon the living from the land of the dead, and are pervaded by references to seeing and not seeing.20 The land of the dead is itself called Mpemba, which means white kaolin clay and which in turn is used as a sign of clairvoyance and innocence. Yet this seeing is contradicted, in the appearance of the nkisi itself, by the murky accumulation of unreadable oddments. To understand this contradiction, we must look more generally at both "art objects" and Kongo ideas about collective well-being. In Kongo thought, individual and collective misfortunes are caused by moral and political disorder, which should be kept in check by specially consecrated chiefs (or the government). If the chief is absent or ineffectual, individuals are obliged to protect themselves by resorting to minkisi. Individual motives, however, are deemed likely to be selfish and anti-social, so for at least the 500 years of documented history there have been periodic outbursts of ?conoclasm directed against minkisi. In the twentieth century, such movements have been led by "prophets" (ngunza), who characteristically wear white clothes and employ ritual equipment marked 19. During politically tense times in Zaire my vehicle was often searched by gendarmes; it was obvious that to them any small, wrapped object was potentially dangerous, whereas large packages were ignored. 20. Seeing and not seeing, as Freud tells us, has erotic associations. About a quarter of all nkondi, for example, are equipped with genitalia, male or female, which would be conspicuous if they were not covered by a skirt (one such, in the Pigorini Museum in Rome, is described in the museum's file as sviluppatissimo). This feature has nothing to do with fertility; it permitted the operator to increase the drama of his performance by "accidentally" causing the nkondi to expose itself, whereupon all present were obliged to fall to the ground: "To see the backside of an nkondi is strictly forbidden." 18. Kongo nkondi are similar to Fon bocio from Dahomey. Suzanne Blier says that packets of potent substances on a figure's surface produce "competing visual tensions of bursting and constriction, interior and exterior, covering and exposure" (Blier 1995:1).</page><page sequence="10">146 RES 39 SPRING 2001 by simplicity and transparency, which they explicitly contrast with the obscurities of minkisi and personal ambition. In earlier centuries, when there were chiefs, they were consecrated by being put in touch with "nature spirits" (bisimbi), represented in many areas by large rocks of remarkable shape. The three simbi stones of the clan Mpudi a Nzinga, for example, constituted a sort of lithic version of the chief: Pangu Lunzi, a rock standing as though someone had planted it there; his wife, Ngwa Mayene, "Old Mother Breasts," which had four breasts, two in front and two behind; and his treasure chest, a stone with four corners, as smooth as a real chest (MacGaffey 2000a:188ff.). Such stones seem to have been created by intentional agency, and are therefore astonishing; one of the generic names for the spirits they represent is lusunzi, meaning something unexpected and splendid. No Kongolese, confronting a remarkable stone, invents the notion of bisimbi to explain it; the idea has already been taught him, it is part of the cultural equipment with which he interprets the world, as is the idea of enhancing his chances in a given contingency by appeal to an nkisi. Artworks manifest the constraints of "culture," and they are linked to it by the concept of characteristic "style" (Gell, p. 153). Artworks, like individual persons, are grouped in collectivities that shape their existence because they refer back and forth in time to other members, whether the group in question be all Maori tattoos or the complete works of Picasso. Gell rejects formal analyses of style based on linguistic models, pointing out that the results do not justify the labor (p. 164). (Analogously, one can program a computer to analyze Mozart's piano sonatas and to generate an endless number of new ones; the trouble is, they lack genius.) Artworks, he says, do their cognitive work, not in isolation but by synergistic cooperation with one another. "This is the basis of the intuition we have that in some way stylistic affinity among works of art echoes the unity of thought which binds members of social groups together" (p. 163). He explores this admittedly cloudy notion by an extended analysis of Marquesan art. All Marquesan art consisted of motifs applied to the surface of the human body, or to objects such as canoes, houses, furniture, which were treated as though they were human bodies. The corpus of motifs can be read as transformations of one another by a series of rules. Marquesan style is not so much the totality of the works as the field of legitimate moves by which one motif can be transformed into another; no other art style (Samoan tattooing, for example) is based on the same set of rules (p. 217). Gell argues that homogeneity in Marquesan style is generated by "the principle of least difference": the forms taken by motifs and figures are the ones that involve the least modification of neighboring motifs consistent with the establishment of a difference between them. This principle is not detectable in any given artifact taken in isolation, but only in the ensemble of relations constituted by all Marquesan artifacts. He then finds an analogy with Marquesan society, in which everybody was acutely preoccupied with competitive establishment of social difference. In the course of Marquesan history, consisting of "an infinite number of tiny social initiatives" taken by individuals over a very long period, there developed "an elective affinity between a modus operandi in the artifactual domain, which generated motifs by minuscule variations on other motifs, and a social modus operandi which created 'differences' arbitrarily against a background of fusional sameness" (p. 219). This is a bold hypothesis, presented at such a level of abstraction that it may be impossible to test, although at another level it seems inescapable: given that Marquesan artifacts displaying immensely subtle ornament are intimately bound up with social competition, there must be some stylistic connection between the two. A different sort of test could be to find a similar correlation in the art of an entirely different sort of society, such as Kongo. The idea is worth exploring, although a full treatment would require as much space as Gell devotes to the Marquesan case. It is important to note that Gell's "style" is the product of relationships within the corpus of artworks, not the typical appearance, in the usual sense of form criticism, that prompts us to recognize individual pieces as conforming to a style. "Kongo style" is not, according to this way of thinking, a property of any single Kongo object. What is the corpus of Kongo "artworks" to be analyzed? It cannot be restricted to those found in museums, which represent the motives of collectors rather than any indigenous category, and fail to represent even the full range of nkisi types. I have already suggested that the corpus must include simbi stones. Such stones, as shrines (nkisi nsi), were modified by applications of paint and by "medication" with objects buried near them. Minkisi were (and are) literally containers, but were also constructed in various ways to suggest the containment of unseen forces, and</page><page sequence="11">MacGaffey: Astonishment and stickiness in Kongo art 147 supplied with multiple external signs of what those forces might be capable of. Human persons are also thought of as containers, whose animating principle ("soul," "spirit") can be transferred to other containers, including graves, animals, sea-shells and rocks. Exceptionally able people were (and are) thought of as having been modified in this way; they included chiefs, who were transformed by practices closely resembling the composition of minkisi, and were in fact sometimes called nkisi. At their deaths, chiefs could be transformed into simbi stones, such as the one with marks on it of a leopard's spots that is known as the simbi of the chief Me Mbuku Mbangala (MacGaffey 2000a:198). Other "containers," all with the same form, included the house and the village, with a boundary, entrance and exit, and an orientation with respect to the cardinal points. For the social person, the four directions were (in principle) those of the four clans to which he or she was related (MacGaffey 1970:141, 150, 237; 1986:124). Entrances and boundaries to houses and villages were protected by minkisi located strategically at boundaries and entrances, just as individuals protected their bodies with amulets at appropriate points, so that life processes should go smoothly.21 So social persons, too, especially chiefs, were assemblages; both the painted stripes and spots applied to chiefs and their sculpted staffs of office attract the words kimbula and nsisi "frightful, startling."22 I have already mentioned, however, the pervasive tension between elaboration and simplicity, from stickiness to great white rocks, in which complexity was seen as at best a means of coping with threatening disorder, at worst a source of it. The ritual career of chiefs, from nkisi to simbi, itself represented, it would seem, a "philosophical" reflection on this theme, the search for simplicity, permanence and tranquility in a world of war, witchcraft and disease (MacGaffey 2000a:208). The stylistic integrity of Kongo art is generally recognized not only by experts but by the public. Does this style in art correspond to a cultural style, a pattern in social relations? Kongolese were (and are) as individually competitive as anyone else, but they were ideologically preoccupied not with minute calibrations of identity, as were the Marquesans, but with order in the community and the perpetual search for right eating, right marriage and right government. The unit to be ordered is the community?a lineage and its adherents, domiciled in a village; the word ngudi, which can mean "mother, lineage, authority figure, source, interior," summarizes the essential features of this social "container."23 The quest for an idealized order expresses itself in a perpetual tension between ?conoclasm and iconoduly (idolatry) revealed both in ritual practice and, within the corpus of artworks, in the degree of stickiness, as I have indicated. These ideas, though evident as influences on style, are diffuse by comparison with the formal rules governing decorative patterns, and they neither specify just what it is that makes Kongo art recognizable as such, nor permit us to say anything about the internal differences that have prompted specialists to divide it into a large number of local styles.24 "Kongo" art bears a family resemblance to that of the rainforests in general, in Central and perhaps also in Western Africa, areas throughout which the principles of social structure are also very similar, although there is much local variation, diffusion, and evidence of change over time. I have argued elsewhere is that the relationship between art style and social structure in these areas contrasts with that which obtains in other areas of the continent, but such units are much larger than those with which art criticism (or anthropology) usually tries to deal (MacGaffey 2000b). The relationship cannot be deterministic; and after all, many societies, although they generate and preserve material indexes of agency, 21. All this is elaborated in Janzen's account of the practice and thought of the healer Nzo a Mambu (Janzen 1978:169-192). Examples of homology between person, house and village are found in rituals and indigenous accounts of nkondi (MacGaffey 1986:chap. 5). Gender is of course also built into this structure, with respect to the body, the house and the village. 22. The several Kongo words that describe the effect upon the spectator of the appearance of both chiefs and nkondi recall Edmund Burke's notion of the astonishment inspired by such "sublime" phenomena as thunder storms. Mitchell points out the gendered aspect of Burke's distinctions: the sublime is masculine, the beautiful feminine. Nkondi sculptures, associated with "the above," thunder storms, birds of prey, and judicial functions, are likewise masculine, as opposed to nkondi "of the below," which are relatively "feminine" (MacGaffey and Harris 1993:69; Mitchell 1986:129). 23. In 1970, one Kongo prophet built, as the centerpiece of his messianic establishment, a huge circle, in concrete painted white, which was literally a diagram of the morally contained community. My photograph of this construction appears in (Thompson and Cornet 1981:fig. 122). 24. Unfortunately, these local styles are presented as belonging to ethnically distinct "sub-tribes." (Lehuard 1989; MacGaffey 2000:70).</page><page sequence="12">148 RES 39 SPRING 2001 produce little or nothing that merits stylistic analysis, and there is no general, supra-historical reason why collective social experience should be represented in any particular medium or style. Gell provides an explanation of style itself, not a way of describing any particular style. Gell's concluding chapter boldly takes on one of the great issues in social science, one that has been implicit in the whole argument up to this point: the possibility of merging the psychological and sociological accounts of personhood, the "inspiration" of the artist with the organization of the society in which he or she lives. Consciousness, he argues (drawing on Husserl and Nancy Munn), is "a mental process through which subjective temporality is constituted via a process of transformation of conscious experience over time," a process combining memory and anticipation. The indexes of agency that circulate in the external social world constitute an isomorphic structure, a series of transformations of images over time (Gell 1998:228; 1992). An artist's uvre, such as that of Marcel Duchamp, can be considered as a single object, distributed in time, not just chronologically in the world but in the consciousness of its creator. Analogously, histories of art demonstrate an externalized and collectivized cognitive process, a tradition. A Maori meeting-house is a memory of the ancestors present in it, and of previous meeting-houses (themselves embodying earlier memories); a compromise between the house the builders would like to put up and the limitations of their resources; and a promise to build, some day, a meeting-house much grander than anyone else's (p. 257). A comparable example might be a show of the work of an internationally known clothing designer, in which is implicit his previous work, his competitive relationship with other designers, and his reading of the current values of his clients.25 Both "mind" and "art," as Gell insists, are biographical and therefore social; a person's mind and personhood are not confined to particular spatio temporal coordinates, but consist of a spread of biographical events and memories of events, and a dispersed category of material objects, traces and leavings, which can be attributed to a person and which testify to agency and patienthood during a career that may prolong itself after death.26 A Mande hunter's shirt, dyed murky brown, littered with an accumulation of antelope horns, boar's teeth, animal claws and skin covered amulets, "represents the experiences and knowledge of an individual hunter," and indicates his secret powers (Adams 1989:39). The description would also fit a much-nailed nkondi, hung with the tokens of bygone treaties, thefts and diseases. The Mande shirt contrasted with the plain white cloth preferred in ordinary clothing and testified to an individual life of exceptional agency, just as nkondi figures registered the conflicted history of the communities that they served and contrasted with the tranquil white of innocence, permanence and the land of the dead. Nothing about this anthropology of art precludes aesthetic, sociological or other approaches, or even prevents us, if we choose, to limit "art" to whatever is treated as such by critics. An apologetic approach to African and other exotic arts will continue to be necessary as long as the traditional categorical distinctions defining primitive (or "ethnographic," or "tribal") art are sustained in the public mind by social and political values. Gell's theory dispenses with the spurious dichotomies built into art criticism hitherto; it allows us to move seamlessly from one ethnographic context to another, and confirms, rather than displaces, the descriptions and interpretations we already offer. Although?indeed because?it defines artworks by their implication in social relations, it illuminates their specifically visual features in new ways, and goes far towards reconciling the traditionally opposed perspectives of the art critic and the ethnographer. 25. In the Fall of 2000, the Guggenheim Museum in New York put on a retrospective of the work of Giorgio Armani. A reviewer thought that the designer's success was partly due to the cover which his "low risk" style, evasive about age, aggression and desire, afforded to clients whose milieu was marked by high-risk sexual behavior, violent political struggle and rapacious economic speculation (Judith Thurman, in The New Yorker, Nov. 6, 2000, p. 100). 26. The artist Mingwei Lee has built his career on a series of installations in which strangers are invited to participate in carefully arranged "ordinary social situations" and to leave behind them objective traces of the encounter, which then constitute the material of the "artwork" (Kay Larson, in The New York Times, 5 November 2000).</page><page sequence="13">MacGaffey: Astonishment and stickiness in Kongo art 149 BIBLIOGRAPHY Adams, M. 1989 "Beyond Symmetry in Middle African Design."
