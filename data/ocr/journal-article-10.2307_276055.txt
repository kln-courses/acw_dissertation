<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS ARCTIC Two expeditions will collaborate in studies on the Aleu- tian Islands this summer. The Harvard Aleutian Expedi- tion, with support from the Viking Fund and the U. S. Navy, will study the biology of the living Aleuts and the archaeology of their predecessors. The center of operations will be Umnak Island. The party will be under the leader- ship of William Laughlin who will be particularly concerned with archaeology and with blood typing. The other mem- bers will be: Dr. Coenraad Frans August Moorrees, ortho- dontist, Forsyth Dental Infirmary; Dr. Fred Alexander, cardiologist, Massachusetts General Hospital; Stanley M. Garn, anthropologist, attached to both of the above insti- tutions; Alan G. May, archaeologist; Charles I. Shade, archaeological assistant, Harvard University; and Gordon Marsh, linguist, University, of Nevada. The physical an- thropology division of the expedition will work for a time on Umnak, then move on to other islands, where clinics will be held for making medical examinations, blood group- ing, and anthropological measurements. The archaeological group plan to excavate the old village site at Nikolski, Umnak Island. This is a rich site, with a twenty-five foot accumulation of stratified midden, representing the Rus- sian, Aleut, and "pre-Aleut" periods of occupation. It was sampled by Hrdli&amp;ka in 1938, when both Laughlin and May were members of his party. Although Hrdli&amp;ka obtained many artifacts and skeletal remains, these were without stratigraphic data. The purpose of the present investiga- tions is to establish the stratigraphic sequence at this site, and if possible at another site on the south end of the island. If time and opportunity permit, stratigraphic col- umns and pollen samples will also be secured from any sites accessible to places visited by the physical anthropological group. Independent of, but cooperating with this expedition, will be a party from the Botanical Gardens of the Univer- sity of Michigan, consisting of Theodore P. Bank and Robert Dorsett. They will make ethno-botanical studies in collaboration with Gordon Marsh, the linguist, and will also identify all botanical specimens obtained by the archaeologists. Even more interesting is their plan to make pollen analyses of material from strata at all the sites investigated by the archaeologists, as well as of bog ma- terials near the sites. While the Harvard Aleutian Expedition will return in September, Bank and Dorsett plan to continue their work through the winter and following summer, and hope to establish winter quarters by homesteading on the Aleutians. They will make detailed studies of the ecology of the area, in which attention will be given to the relationship between village sites and vegetation patterns. They also plan to make archaeological collections of such materials as may be obtained without disturbing unspoiled sites. The National Museum of Denmark and the University of Alaska will resume this summer their fruitful collaboration in archaeology, which was begun at Point Hope in 1939. The main purpose of the present project is to make an archaeological survey of the Alaskan coast in the Norton Sound-Bristol Bay area. The party is expected to consist of the following: Dr. J. L. Giddings, Dr. Ivar Skarland, Mr. Wendell Oswalt, and Mr. Owen Rye of the University of Alaska; Dr. Helge Larsen and Dr. Erik Holtved of the Danish National Museum. Giddings will make a recon- naissance of Norton Sound, Oswalt will work from the mouth of the Yukon to the mouth of the Kuskowkim, and Larsen will investigate Bristol Bay. Giddings will also con- tinue his dendrochronological studies, and for this purpose will make a trip to St. Lawrence Island. Holtved will take part in the archaeological work, although his main concern will be to reco-d tales and songs from as many different groups as possible, primarily from the Kuskokwim and Bristol Bay Eskimo. The whole project is being financed by the Danish Expedition Fund and the Arctic Institute of North America. The Andover-Harvard Yukon Expedition, financed by grants from the Peabody Foundation, Harvard University, the Viking Fund, the American Philosophical Society, and the Arctic Institute, will conduct an extensive archaeo- logical, botanical, and geologicalreconnaissance of theregion between Whitehorse and the Donjek River in Yukon Terri- tory. The area was chosen on the basis of experience gained during a survey of the Alaska Highway in 1944 (see John- son in AMERICAN ANTIQUITY, Vol. XI, No. 3, 1946, pp. 183-6) as one in which collaboration between these three disciplines might shed valuable light on early human occu- pation. It is especially hoped that the archaeological ma- terial previously secured in a buried layer of wind-blown soil may be augmented and its significance more fully understood. The party will consist of the following: Frederick Johnson and Elmer Harp, archaeologists; Dr. and Mrs. Hugh M. Raup and William Drury, botanists;</page><page sequence="2">72 AMERICAN ANTIOUITY ri 1Qo4 Dr. Leland Horberg, geologist; and Karl and David Raup, assistants. Dr. Douglas Leechman of the National Museum of Canada will make an extensive archaeological reconnais- sance in western Canada. Six weeks will be spent on the plains, about two weeks in southern Yukon Territory and Alaska, and about two months on the British Columbia coast. At the invitation of the Canadian Government, Henry B. Collins, Jr. will conduct archaeological research on Cornwallis Island, where the recently established U. S.- Canadian Weather Station at Resolute Bay will be his headquarters. The archaeological work will be done for the Smithsonian Institution and for the National Museum of Canada, the latter to be represented by an assistant. Corn- wallis Island lies northwest of Baffin Island and well north of the Magnetic Pole. No Eskimos have lived on it or on any of the other islands of the Parry group within historic times, but many ruins have been found there. Although the archaeology of the region is entirely unknown, it is ex- pected that evidences of the Thule, and possibly of the Dorset culture will be discovered. Dr. Hans-Georg Bandi of the Ethnographic Museum of Basel is reported to be planning archaeological research on Clavering Island, northeast Greenland. This is the island where Dr. Helge Larsen conducted extensive excavations at the very large site of Dodemandsbugten, "Dead Man's Bay" (cf. Larsen in Meddelelser om Gronland, Vol. 102, No. 1, 1934). (F. de L.) SOUTHWEST The 1948 Southwestern Anthropological Field Confer- ence will be held at the University of Arizona Archaeological Field School at Point of Pines, on the San Carlos Indian Reservation, in Arizona. The dates are August 24th through 26th. While the group discussions will center about archaeo- logical problems, efforts will be made to keep the scope of discussion broad enough to hold the interest of those not primarily engaged in this field, and all anthropologists are invited. The University, through the courtesy of Viking Fund, Inc., will furnish board and such lodging in tents (capacity about 65) as will be available. Participants are requested to bring small tents if possible, and their own bedrolls. Inquiries and suggestions for the agenda will be welcomed. Address Dr. Emil Haury, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona. The University of Arizona Archaeological Field School will be in session from June 26th to August 20th with ap- proximately twenty students. Dr. Edward H. Spicer has been awarded a grant from the Viking Fund which will enable him during the summer to complete two extensive manuscripts on the Yaqui Indians. Mrs. Clara Lee Tanner will spend part of the summer in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on an Indian Arts Fund Fellow- ship. She will engage in studies of modern Southwestern Indian painting, a project which will also be continued through the next academic year. Mrs. Tanner has been given a leave of absence from the University of Arizona to pursue this project. Harry T. Getty and Bertram S. Kraus will be working on their respective problems-"Interethnic Relationships in the Community of Tucson" and "Constitutional Typol- ogy and Race, a Study of Somatotypes among Japanese of Northern Honshu." The Department of Anthropology of the University of Arizona, as authorized by administra- tive action, will offer the Ph.D. degree in Anthropology beginning in September, 1948. The year 1948 marks the twentieth anniversary of the founding of the Museum of Northern Arizona, concurrently with its nineteenth archaeological expedition. Dr. Harold S. Colton, Director of the Museum, and Dr. S. Watson Smith, director of the expedition, will begin field work on June 21st. Miss Katherine Bartlett, Curator of Anthro- pology of the Museum, will supervise the laboratory work. Eight students and several Hopis will constitute the per- sonnel of the expedition. The project includes the study of the Sinagua-Kayenta frontier near Flagstaff at about 1150 to 1200 A.D., and the excavation of several small Pueblo III sites on the Wupatki National Monument near the Citadel, and several near Winona, east of Flagstaff. The ex- pedition will spend the first six weeks on the excavation, and an equal period at the Museum studying the material and preparing a report. Dr. Frederica de Laguna and Dr. Gladys Reichard, Research Associates of the Museum, will spend the summer at Flagstaff. The Amerind Foundation of Dragoon, Arizona has been operating a small field project on the Babocomari Wash, a small stream which enters the San Pedro River near Fair- bank, Arizona. Charles Di Peso is in charge of the work. The significant features thus far are house types, large and shallow fire pits, and a very few cremation pits. One of the latter produced upward of 5000 very small stone beads. The field work will continue until the middle of June. The staff of Gila Pueblo, Globe, Arizona, has been aug- mented by the addition of John S. MacSporran, Treasurer and General Assistant, and Miss Ruth Agawa, Laboratory Assistant. The Pueblo's winter activities included the dat- ing of wood specimens for F. C. Hibben of the University of New Mexico and R. Burgh of the University of Colorado, as well as the restoration, classification, and study of mate- rial gathered at Mesa Verde and at a ruin in the Apache National Forest by Dr. Deric O'Bryan. On May 1st Dr. O'Bryan began another six weeks at an Apache National Forest ruin, with the assistance of Mr. MacSporran, in an effort to date the beginning of St. Johns Polychrome. During the balance of the summer Dr. O'Bryan will continue his excavations at Mesa Verde National Park, working in ruins somewhat later in age than those ex- cavated last year. The Developmental Pueblo ruins ex- cavated in the Park by O'Bryan in 1947 will be opened to the public this summer, according to Don Watson of the National Park Service. These comprise three small mesa- top villages covering a time span of about two centuries and are of types not previously excavated in the park. At the Chicago Natural History Museum, Drs. Paul Martin and John Rinaldo have been analyzing the results of last summer's excavations in the Mogollon area of west- ern New Mexico. The report on this work is now in press and will probably be out this year. Dr. George Quimby has been preparing archaeological reports on work which he undertook in the lower Mississippi valley. During the summer, Dr. Martin and Dr. Rinaldo expect to return to</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND NEWS 73 western New Mexico and exacvate more sites belonging to the San Francisco, Three Circle, Reserve, and Tularosa phases. During the spring, the anthropology staff of the Chicago Natural History Museum, in cooperation with Dr. Fred Eggan of the University of Chicago, has participated in a seminar on problems in Southwestern archaeology and ethnology. Special attention was paid to the relationships among the archaeological and ethnological cultures. Clari- fication of these problems involves consideration of the development and interrelations of the major archaeological cultures, a survey of the historic culture types, and an intensive analysis of the continuity between the two. After working over the collections from earlier work at the Turner site, near Cisco, Utah, Marie Wormington of the Colorado Museum of Natural History plans to resume the clearing of the remainder of the village during the sum- mer. A paper relating to a proposed revision of Yuma point terminology and a third, enlarged edition of "Ancient Man in North America" also are current projects of the Museum. In addition to research, Miss Wormington has been teach- ing a course in Southwestern Archaeology at the Uni- versity of Denver.' Some of her students have been assisting her in surveying some archaeological sites threatened by the Cherry Creek dam project near Denver. The winter's program of the Denver Art Museum was devoted chiefly to the preparation of new exhibits, catalog checking, and the acquisition of Pacific material. The museum director, F. H. Douglas, during the spring semes- ters, taught courses in material culture both at the Uni- versity of Denver and the University of Colorado. As announced heretofore, the Department of Anthro- pology of the University of Colorado is sponsoring two field programs. One of these is supervised by Robert H. Lister and Robert F. Burgh and involves five weeks of field work in archaeology in the Yampa Canyon, Dinosaur National Monument, Colorado. The University of Colorado Museum is cooperating in the venture. The second program, in charge of Dr. Omer Stewart, consists of five weeks of field work in social science at the ethnically-mixed com- munity of Ignacio, Colorado. During the past winter Burgh continued archaeological reconnaissance in reservoir areas east of the continental divide on the Colorado-Big Thompson project. The anthropology hall of the University Museum was recently completely remodeled. Exhibits now include ethnological displays, as well as the featured South- western archaeological material collected by Earl Morris over a period of years. A publication Series in Anthropology was recently established by the University and one manu- script submitted is Burgh's "Yampa Canyon Archaeology." In Santa Fe, the Indian Arts Fund, under the chairman- ship of Dr. Walter Taylor, Jr., has offered several Summer Fellowships for the purpose of getting the collections of the Fund known in the anthropological and art worlds, and providing the means for their study. It is planned that these Fellowships (of $200.00 each) will continue each summer and will be increased in number. Dr. Taylor has, in addition to his Indian Arts Fund activities, been en- 1 For further information concerning activities at the University of Denver, see the Plains section. Editor. gaged in an intensive study of his Coahuila cave materials -a study which he plans to complete by the end of the year. The anthropology field sessions of the University of New Mexico include an advanced session in central Utah, spe- cializing in archaeology and ethnology, under the direction of Dr. Florence Hawley. Eight students will participate. The general field session this year will be held in Albu- querque and will be concerned with the excavation of two archaeological sites near Albuquerque. Stanley Stubbs, of the Laboratory of Anthropology and Museum of New Mexico, will be in charge of one of the excavations; Fred Wendorf of the University of Arizona will be in charge of another; and Thomas Mathews, of the University of New Mexico, will direct the laboratory work. The regular sum- mer courses on the campus will be taught by Paul Reiter. In addition, the university is either sponsoring or cooperat- ing in five other field projects, which will be summarized in the fall. Within the past year, an independent Department of Anthrop6logy has been created at the University of Utah. Dr. E. Adamson Hoebel, formerly of New York University, has been appointed Chairman of the Department. In in- struction, Dr. Hoebel will deal with anthropological theory, culture and personality, and cultural anthropology; Dr. Charles E. Dibble will stress Central and South American ethnology, archaeology, and linguistics; and Elmer R. Smith will specialize in the field of inter-cultural relations, cultural anthropology, and Southwestern archaeology, with emphasis on ancient cave cultures of the Great Basin and the northern periphery. During the winter and spring months, Mr. Sydney Jameson has been studying the ar- chaeological material obtained from excavations on Stans- bury Island in the Great Salt Lake. Effective in the spring, Dr. Dibble has been released from half of his teaching duties for research necessary to the translation of Sahagun's Historia general de las cosas de Nueva Espana as found in the Florentine Codex. This project is undertaken in co- operation with A. J. 0. Anderson, Department of History, Museum of New Mexico. The total project is expected to take five years. Prof. F. C. V. Worman, of the Department of Social Sciences of Adams State College, Alamosa, Colorado, has announced a summer field session in archaeology, from June 21 to August 27, to be located at Bandelier National Monument, west of Santa Fe, New Mexico. The session is announced as the first of a five-year program of archaeologi- cal research to be carried on at this location. The enroll- ment is limited to fifteen students. Under the direction of Dr. Robert E. Bell, the University of Oklahoma has also announced a field session in archaeological research, in conjunction with the University of Oklahoma Museum. The location of this research is the Scott site on Fourche Maline Creek, in eastern Oklahoma. The summer of 1948 sees the beginning of the field work of the Upper Gila Expedition of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. Excavations relative to early man will be undertaken from June 10 through September 12, in the San Augustin Plains area, under the direction of Herbert W. Dick, graduate student at Harvard. Because of a belief</page><page sequence="4">74 AMfERICAN ANTIQUITY [1, 1948 in the scientific value of the project, the Anthropology Field Sessions of the University of New Mexico is cooperating. Dr. J. 0. Brew, formerly Curator of Southwestern Ar- chaeology at the Peabody Museum of Harvard University, will become Director of the Museum on July 1st. Dr. Brew succeeds Professor Donald Scott, who retires on this date. Professor Scott, along with his colleagues, will long be re- membered for his active support of the Museum's extended field work in the Southwest and many other parts of the world, and particularly for his share in the vastly enlivened publication program of the Peabody Museum. All of Pro- fessor Scott's friends and former students will be aware that his retirement is, in large part, a formality, and that his assistance with archaeological research and his studies of petroglyphs will continue for years. (P.R.) PLAINS At the University of Texas, according to Alex Krieger, T. N. Campbell, Chairman of the Department of Anthro- pology, has continued work on his publication concerning Texas coastal archaeology. He hopes to make investigations in the field during the first half of the summer. During the spring semester he and J. Charles Kelley conducted a stu- dent excavation program in a rock shelter near Austin. Kelley has spent most of his available time in building new displays in the Anthropology Museum, concentrating on the demonstration of research methods. Lois Kelley has completed two magnificent paintings for the museum, one an exact reproduction of part of the Altamira Cave paint- ings, the other a similar reproduction of presumably ceremonial figures from a western Texas shelter wall. In July and August, Kelley plans to conduct a reconnaissance of the Rio Grande valley between El Paso and Presidio. H. C. Taylor, advanced student in the department, plans a summer reconnaissance in the Pecos River-Rio Grande confluence area, working on both the Texas and the Mexi- can sides. Plans are also under way for the annual meeting of the Texas Archaeological and Paleontological Society, to be held in Austin in October. Alex Krieger, University of Texas archaeologist, con- tinued publication work during the winter, principally on the Davis mound site in eastern Texas. Several short papers were also prepared, and during the spring an article on "early man" problems, together with the tentative program of the Sixth Plains Conference were issued in the Plains Conference News Letter. Letters on the River Basins Survey work were sent to all Texas Congressmen, and vari- ous amateurs and archaeological societies were also urged to write. On April 1, Krieger received a $5,000 grant from the Viking Fund, Inc., to conduct excavations at the Battle Mound site on Red River in southwest Arkansas. The field work is being directed by Mr. M. P. Miroir of Texarkana. Since the mound lies on an old channel of Red River, and its base has been buried by silting of the flood plain, an interesting geological problem is also presented. Two nearby cemeteries are being explored, and the mound slopes are being followed downward in an attempt to locate the sub-mound village. The cultural affiliations of the great mound, 592 feet long with platforms at different levels on all four sides, have not yet been determined. A contour map of the entire site is being prepared. During the winter and spring, R. L. Stephenson of the River Basins Survey conducted field work in eastern Texas, first in the "Dam B" basin on the Neches River, then in the very large McGee Bend Reservoir on the Angelina River east of the Neches. On April 20 he returned to Austin to analyze his results. The Dallas Archaeological Society (R. K. Harris, presi- dent) has been doing important work for two years in re- covering materials from reservoir projects north and east of Dallas. A house outline in a non-pottery site has been completely cleared and accurately recorded. The Houston Anthropological Society (R. B. Worthington, president) has been continuing the exploration of sites in reservoir basins in the Houston area. Grayson E. Meade and Glen L. Evans of the Texas Memorial Museum, Austin, continued work in the spring on the deep deposits in Montell shelter, 40 miles north of Uvalde in southwestern Texas. Artifacts and flint chips have been met many feet down in the 15-foot layer of decomposed limestone which underlies a 4-foot layer of "burnt-rock midden." This site promises to yield crucial information on the little-known but undoubtedly early horizon which precedes the typical Edwards Plateau culture. E. T. Hall, University of Denver, writes that his De- partment has under way the following research projects: acculturation studies of American Indians resident in Denver; development of audio and visual aids for classroom use in cultural anthropology, by F. H. Douglas, E. T. Hall, and Miss Arminta Neel; archaeological survey of the high western plains, by A. M. Withers. During the coming summer, Withers will conduct an archaeological survey of east-central Colorado under the sponsorship of the River Basin Surveys. Dr. Hall will leave the University of Denver to accept a position next year on the Social Studies Faculty of Bennington College, Bennington, Vermont. At the University of Kansas, Carlyle S. Smith replaced A. C. Spaulding as Assistant Curator of Anthropology in September, 1947. Smith has carried on survey work in Kanopolis Reservoir near Ellsworth, Kansas, in preparation for eight weeks of intensive excavation to be conducted there in the summer of 1948. Preliminary investigations by the University and the River Basin Surveys reveal the pres- ence of sites attributable to Woodland, Upper Republican, and Great Bend cultures. The University of Kansas Museum of Natural History is recipient of an extensive collection of archaeological mate- rial presented by Mr. Floyd Schultz of Clay Center, Kan- sas. The material was collected by Mr. Schultz along the lower valley of the Republican River, from sites attribut- able to the Upper Republican and Hopewellian cultures. All of the material is documented, catalogued, and has been prepared by the donor, and it represents an important con- tribution to Great Plains archaeology. A new combination office and laboratory has been built contiguous to the previous archaeological storeroom. Addi- tional new facilities include laboratory equipment, excavat- ing tools, camping equipment, and a station wagon. Work</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND NEWS 75 immediately in prospect includes analysis and publication of the data gleaned from the Schultz collection and the field studies at Kanopolis. From Carl H. Chapman, University of Missouri, comes word that reconnaissance of water-control reservoir areas has been accomplished in large part by calling upon non- professional archaeologists for aid in the field. The investiga- tions have been kept under control by the organization of local chapters of the Missouri Archaeological Society. These chapters have taken the responsibility of reporting locations to the state Society, and all the investigations have been in close cooperation with the University, which acts as a directive agent and clearing house for information and projects. The University and the Society are cooperating with the Smithsonian Institution wherever Federal water- control projects are involved. At Clearwater Reservoir during March a survey by the University, the Archaeological Society, and the Academy of Science of St. Louis disclosed some thirty-five sites; only about half the future pool area was investigated. Pottery was found on a few of these locations; it was predominantly shell tempered, with cord-roughened exteriors and flat- based vessels. Associated artifacts include full-grooved axes, mortars, pitted hammerstones, small triangular and stemmed projectile points, large crude stemmed points, and a shell-tempered clay pipe with flat base and projecting stem. The pottery sites here may be of fundamental im- portance in tracing the influence of Mississippi people upon Woodland cultures of the region. Other projects included a survey on Little North Fork River, a part of the Bull Shoals Reservoir, and a survey of the Waco Reservoir, where fourteen sites were located. From June 8 to July 30, the University of Missouri will con- duct a field session in archaeology. Surveys and excavations will be made at Clearwater Reservoir on Black River, at the edge of the St. Francois Mountains, in the Bull Shoals Reservoir area in southwestern Missouri, and at sites in Vernon and Saline Counties. The Nebraska State Historical Society will carry on field work in the Medicine Creek Reservoir area of southwestern Nebraska. Primary emphasis will be on excavation and test- ing of Upper Republican and other sites lying near the dam site. This work will be under direction of Mr. A. T. Hill, and will be a continuation of excavations by the same or- ganization last summer, when several earth lodges were un- covered and extensive collections made. The society is co- operating closely with the River Basin Surveys in this work, as well as in the subsequent analysis of the findings. Dr. John L. Champe announces plans for a University of Nebraska Laboratory of Anthropology summer field session in the Harlan County Reservoir area in southern Nebraska. Sites to be investigated include one of the Dismal River complex, and another whose cultural affiliations and nature are still undefined. This work is also in cooperation with the River Basin Surveys. W. H. Over reports that activities at the University of South Dakota Museum during the past few months have been confined largely to analysis of materials recovered from three sites partially excavated during the summer of 1947. A report has been completed on the work at the La Roche site in southeastern Stanley County; release of the publication is scheduled for the end of April. The manu- script of a preliminary report on the Thomas Riggs site in Hughes County has also been finished, but publication plans are uncertain. Plans for the 1948 field season are still uncertain. Tenta- tively, a curtailed program of ficld investigations is contem- plated along the Missouri River, possibly in the vicinity of Pierre. In the event that these plans materialize, the field work will be under the direction of Mrs. Edith George of the South Dakota Historical Society. Dr. Gordon Hewes, University of North Dakota, writes that the winter months have been devoted in part to analysis of collections made last summer. The weather has prevented reconnaissance of the Baldhill Dam area, where reservoir construction is now under way. The University's Department of Sociology and Anthropology plans a sum- mer field session, June 21 to July 31, which will include excavation of sites along the Cheyenne River in the area to be flooded by the Baldhill Reservoir. The work will be under the direction of Dr. Hewes, and will be in coopera- tion with the North Dakota State Historical Society. For the Missouri River Basin Survey, I must report that field work got underway again on March 29. With power machinery and labor furnished by the Bureau of Reclama- tion, Mr. M. F. Kivett and George Metcalf began excava- tion of Upper Republican village sites lying on the west abutment of Medicine Creek dam, now under construction. By late April, seven earth-lodge sites, six small midden areas, and miscellaneous other features had been worked out. Approximately four acres of the topsoil had been re- moved by stripping; so an accurate plan of the village ar- rangement will be secured. Large quantities of pottery, stone, bone, and shell artifacts and other materials have been recovered. This, the first large scale application of power equipment to a specific archaeological project in the Missouri Basin, seems to indicate that on certain sites, at least, the procedure can be used to great advantage. For the most part, the Basin Survey staff has been busy in the lab all winter, preparing reports on the various field operations of last year. Reports are well advanced on ex- cavations by Bliss and Hughes at Birdshead Cave in the Boysen Reservoir, Wyoming; by Cooper on various sites in Fort Randall Reservoir, South Dakota; and by Kivett on a prehistoric ossuary in Harlan County Reservoir. Mimeo- graphed reports on survey activities have been issued fre- quently throughout the winter to the National Park Serv- ice, for distribution to the construction agencies and other interested parties. Ethnohistorical files have also been started for use in connection with the surveys. During the next few weeks or months, it is expected that field work will be resumed by the Basin Survey on several fronts. In addition to continuing the Medicine Creek opera- tions, work will be done at Angostura Reservoir in south- western South Dakota, at Heart Butte Reservoir in North Dakota, and probably elsewhere. Uncertainty over Con- gressional action has delayed the final settlement of sum- mer field plans. (W.R.W.)</page><page sequence="6">76 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [1, 1948 NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY For the past three summer seasons the Indiana Historical Society has experimented with the use of students from Indiana University in exploratory work at the Angel site. This has proved so satisfactory that the cooperating agen- cies, namely, the Indiana Historical Society, Indiana Uni- versity, and the Indiana Department of Conservation are making provision for larger groups. Six buildings are being erected at the site for use as dormitories, mess hall, and laboratory. A field course, Anthropology 209, for which Indiana University will allow ten credits, is being offered to graduate and undergraduate students specifically inter- ested in archaeology. The full summer will be devoted to the study of field methods and techniques and actual excavations in the village at the Angel site. Subsistence will be furnished by the Indiana Historical Society to those students accepted. (Taken from Central States Bulletin, Vol. 2, No. 2.) According to Thorne Deuel, the Illinois State Museum and the Department of Anthropology, University of Chi- cago will again conduct joint operations on and near Starved Rock and Utica, Illinois. The Division of Illinois Parks of the Department of Public Works and Buildings will cooperate again this year as last in furnishing camping quarters and part of the labor. An attempt will be made to discover the remains of Fort St. Louis on the Rock with a view to its future restoration by the Illinois Parks Division. Drs. John C. McGregor and Kenneth Orr will be in charge. The Archaeological Survey of Illinois has to date informa- tion from 362 sites from 44 counties in Illinois. This has been furnished chiefly by members of the Illinois State Archaeological Society. The Museum of Anthropology of the University of Michigan will have two field parties this summer. One will be under Dr. Emerson F. Greenman in the Manitoulin District of Georgian Bay, working primarily on Paleo- Indian sites associated with raised beaches. This program is being conducted as part of the Summer Session of the University of Michigan and is open to students registered for credit at the University. The second excavation pro- gram will be in the southwestern corner of Michigan a short distance west of Niles, where a site locally called Moccasin Bluff, which has produced Hopewell, Fisher, Blue Island, and Late Woodland material, will be excavated. This ex- cavation will be under the general direction of Dr. James B. Griffin and under the direct supervision of Hale Smith and Lynn Howard. The University of Michigan's spring dig was again at the Snyders site in Calhoun County, Illinois. This resulted in further confirmation of the developmental sequence with- in Illinois Hopewell and furnished additional evidence on other little-known facets of this culture in the Central Mississippi Valley area. The field party made numerous stops on its way north and spent one evening in Peoria examining the Schoenbeck and Stone collections through the courtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Schoenbeck and Judge Stone. Richard G. Morgan, assisted by Raymond S. Baby, who recently joined the staff of the Ohio State Museum, is ex- cavating a Hopewell Mound in Ross County, Ohio. Present plans call for excavation later this summer near Wilmington of a mound which will be leveled as a hazard to navigation in the Cowan Creek Reservoir. The Wisconsin Archaeological Survey will initiate its ex- cavation program in western Wisconsin opposite Red Cloud, Minnesota, in an extensive group of effigy and coni- cal mounds. It is hoped that these excavations will con- tribute to the problem of the relationship between the Effigy Mound and Hopewell cultural groups and their position in relation to the Oneota Aspect in Wisconsin. According to Robert R. Jones, the anthropology course offered by the University of Wisconsin Extension Division, at some of its Extension Centers last year, included some elementary work in field archaeology. Lectures were fol- lowed by 16 mm. movies of actual work in the field, in slow motion, and finally, by week-end field parties led by their instructor, Robert R. Jones. The first was by the students of the New Richmond center. A site near Star Prairie was excavated with negative results. The second, by the students of the Ladysmith center, dug into one of the group of three unreported mounds on the farm of George Nater, south of Bruce, Wisconsin on the north bank of Soft Maple Creek. A few yards north of this group, a village site was found. A layer of burned earth was encountered at a depth of 24" to 25" near the 10' line, and a little left of the axis of the mound. This yielded a Folsomoid point, fluted nearly to the point on one side and about halfway on the other. From this same undisturbed layer, and in close proximity, fragments of Early Woodland pottery and of quartzite projectile points were found. This material is similar to the stonework found on the adjacent village site. There, points of a shape re- calling Folsomoid, but unfluted and of much coarser work- manship, were found. The fragments of bone found were almost completely disintegrated. Burials appear to have been scattered secondary in type. All three mounds had been badly pitted by lumberjacks about forty years previ- ously. The third and fourth week-end trips were by the Rice Lake and the Spooner center groups respectively. Both parties dug in the extensive group of mounds located on the Caulkins farm, three miles north of Chetek. Two mounds were dug into. The first yielded one flint point of stemmed type. The second mound yielded a disarticulated burial containing parts of two skeletons. This was found in a floor pit near the center of the mound late on the second day of digging. It, too, was of Woodland type. A detailed report of this work, with the needed charts and photographs will appear in the forthcoming spring issue of the Wisconsin Archaeologist. (R.G.M.) NORTHEAST The following statement of projected field work comes from Douglas S. Byers of the R. S. Peabody Foundation, Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts: "During the summer of 1948, the Robert S. Peabody Foundation will have two expeditions in the field. One, sponsored jointly by the Robert Abbe Museum and the Robert S. Peabody Foundation, will continue excavations on a small island in the Union River at Ellsworth Falls, Maine. Preliminary work there has disclosed what appear</page><page sequence="7">vOTF.SQ ADT) NEPW.S4 77 to be three periods of occupation, the upper two related to one another, but the lowest, apparently, in a very different tradition. It is hoped that further work there will contribute greatly to our knowledge of the sequence of cultures in the region. "The second expedition will be sponsored jointly by Harvard University and the Foundation, and will take the field in late May as the Andover-Harvard Yukon Expedi- tion. Supported by grants from both institutions as well as The Viking Fund, The American Philosophical Society, and the Arctic Institute, it will search for further evidence of man and will also gather botanical and geological data from the region in which a survey was made in 1944.2 "The Foundation has also given support in an amount equal to a grant from The Viking Fund, to Messrs. Edward and Murray Rogers, for an archaeological survey of the central part of the Province of Quebec, in territory through which a preliminary reconnaissance has already been made." In Connecticut, according to Dr. Irving Rouse of the Yale Peabody Museum, the Museum and the New Haven Chapter of the Archaeological Society of Connecticut will this summer jointly excavate a shell-heap site of the Coastal culture on Grannis Island in New Haven Harbor. The work will be under the leadership of Howard R. Sargent, a stu- dent of anthropology at Yale University. Two other state chapters will also be active in the field, the Danbury Chap- ter on a site near New Milford and the Windham County Chapter on the Fraser site near Danielson. In addition, Mr. William S. Fowler of the Attleboro Museum will dig a rock shelter at Barkhamsted in collaboration with Dr. Rouse, and Mr. G. D. Pope, Jr., a graduate student at Yale, will excavate at the E. D. Pray site in Killingly. The Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences will have a small party in Ontario during a part of the summer, under the direction of Dr. William A. Ritchie. Beginning on the Bay of Quinte, the Trent Waterway will be searched to or beyond Rice Lake for sites which will (1) throw possible light on still earlier stages of the Owasco culture than any yet discovered in New York, and (2) afford a fuller under- standing of the Point Peninsula manifestation, which in New York appears to be peripheral to a major center in lower Ontario. Dr. Ritchie has recently completed the typing of New York pre-Iroquoian pottery which was started with Richard S. MacNeish in the fall of 1947. A joint report on this work will soon be prepared. A striking discovery made in northern New Jersey by Dr. Lewis M. Haggerty of Hackensack, has been reported by Edmund S. Carpenter of the University of Pennsylvania. To date eleven graves have been opened which contained cremated, flexed, and secondary burials of adults and children. Attendant grave goods amply link the remains to the Middlesex Focus of the Vine Valley Aspect. Present were blocked-end tubes; boat-stones of stone and copper; rectangular gorgets and pentagonal pendants; a steatite cone; thin rolled sheet copper beads; a rectangular copper awl; a copper celt; conch columella shell beads; large stemmed flint blades; corner-notched, side-notched, and 2 Further information concerning this expedition is contained in the section on the Arctic. Editor. pentagonal-shaped projectile points; stone celts; and other articles. Red ocher occurred in at least one of the burials. Mr. John Witthoft has recently been appointed Assistant State Anthropologist of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission and will devote a part of the summer to a reconnaissance of eastern Pennsylvania, after which he will resume excavations on Unami sites along the Dela- ware on a further grant from the Indiana Historical Soci- ety. A New Hampshire Archaeological Society was formed in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Saturday, November 29, 1947. Membership at the first meeting numbered 45. A constitution was adopted and the following men were elected as officers: President: Laurence M. Crosbie, Exeter, N. H. Vice Presidents: Frank 0. Spinney, Director of Manchester Historic Association; James T. Schoolcraft, University of New Hampshire; Henry Phillips, Jr., Exeter. Sec'y-Treas.: Elmer Harp, Jr., Dartmouth College Museum, Hanover, N. H. The New Hampshire Society, aside from acting as a coordinating center for interested people throughout the state, expects to develop a program of active fieldresearch and hopes thereby to help fill some of the blank spots in the prehistory of the Northeast. (W.A.R.) SOUTHEAST There has been established recently a new Department of Anthropology and Archaeology at the University of Georgia with A. R. Kelly as Chairman. Dr. Antonio J. Waring, Jr., of Savannah, has been appointed Research Associate in Archaeology and will collaborate in the preparation of an exhibit at the University on the art and symbolism of the Southeastern Indian tribes with particu- lar reference to the so-called "Southern Cult." The new de- partment has received a grant-in-aid from the Carnegie Fund to prepare the exhibit. The Smithsoniian Institution and the University of Georgia have a cooperative agreement in connection with the River Basin Survey of archaeological sites along several major drainages of Georgia, At present the Smithsonian is conducting a survey of the Clark Hill Dam Reservoir on the Savannah while the University of Georgia is surveying sites on the Lower Flint and Chattahoochee rivers. The Depart- ment of State Parks of Georgia has allocated funds for a twelve-week survey of Kolomoki Mounds State Park in southwest Georgia. The University will have general super- 'vision of the archaeological work which will provide data for the preparation of a culture map that will guide future developmental planning of the area. The University of Florida is expanding its teaching in anthropology with the appointment of John M. Goggin, who has just received his doctorate at Yale, as Associate Professor. The Department of Sociology now becomes the Department of Sociology and Anthropology. Plans call for a development of courses which will eventually lead to an anthropology major. Archaeological research is also con- templated, particularily in the Central Florida region around the University where cultural remains ranging pos- sibly from Paleo-Indian to Spanish mission sites are found.</page><page sequence="8">78 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [1,1948 The University's field program will be integrated with those of other state agencies. The Archaeological Survey of the Florida Park Service has transferred its headquarters from Sebring to Gainesville where it can co-operate more readily with the Florida State Museum and the University of Florida. Hale G. Smith has resigned as Assistant Archaeologist, Florida Park Service, in order to complete his academic work. Recently released was the first bulletin of the Florida Park Service, "The Goodnow Mound, Highlands County, Florida" by John W. Griffin and Hale G. Smith. Tentative plans for the summer call for excavations in the region of Fernandina in extreme northeastern Florida. The field party will work out of Ft. Clinch State Park. From Robert Wauchope, of the Middle American Re- search Institute at Tulane University, comes word of the enlargement of the Institute staff. Three part-time research associates have been added: Arden R. King, Research Associate in Anthropology; William J. Griffith, Research Associate in History; and John Biesantz, Research Associ- ate in Sociology. These new staff members also hold posi- tions in corresponding teaching departments of the College of Arts and Sciences, Newcomb College, and in the Graduate School. The Institute has published two monographs this year: "Physical Anthropology of a Mexican Population in Texas" by A. R. Kelly, and "Excavations at Zacualpa, Guatemala" by Robert Wauchope. Number 5 of the Philological and Documentary Studies, "Landivar's Rusticatio Mexicana," translated by G. W. Regenos, is now in press. Several other shorter manuscripts have been completed for the Record Series and the Miscellaneous Series. John L. Cotter, Archaeologist, National Park Service, reports progress on the NatchezTrace ParkwayArchaeologi- cal Survey. The nine-month campaign at the Bynum site in northern Mississippi carried through the winter and spring with complete excavation of two mounds and systematic testing and partial excavation of an extensive adjoining village site. The field project here will terminate in May with excavation of a third mound. Principal features of the two mounds now completed were: Mound A, dome-shaped earth mound erected over a central burial feature containing a pair of massive logs laid parallel, seven feet apart, on a burnt floor. Between these logs lay an extended principal burial with a pair of copper spools on each wrist. Associated were two flexed burials of adults and one child. A circular pattern of single post molds precedent to the mound were situated beneath the northeast quadrant. Mound B, a central pit feature containing on a burned floor one ex- tended flesh burial and three cremations with a fourth cremation in a sub- pit. Accompanying grave goods were thirty polished greenstone celts, two pairs of copper spools, and two caches of flaked spear points. Large, deep molds extended through the pit floor. The village site featured a series of single, circular post- mold patterns ranging from 35 to 70 feet in diameter. Un- associated, but in the village area, was a single 14-foot pattern of small shallow molds. Several thousand appar- ently random post molds were scattered over the village area, and two concentrations of flexed circular pit burials were located outside of pattern features. In peripheral portions of the village were located two series of probable late eighteenth century Chickasaw burials, flexed, in rectangular graves, with beads and cups and spoons, a silver gorget, copper bells, and miscellaneous articles. A principal historic burial was that of a tall male who wore a silver crown and lay with a flint lock gun as- sembly, metal tomahawk pipe, shell gorget, and miscellane- ous trade objects. At headquarters of the Natchez Trace Parkway, Tupelo, Mississippi, a laboratory in charge of Archaeologist John M. Corbett has processed all field materials currently with the excavation. Preliminary studies of all artifacts are now under way. After a two-month interval for the preparation of a report on the Bynum site, field operations will be transferred to the Emerald Mound site near Natchez, Mississippi. Recent visitors at the University of Kentucky have been W. E. Ekblaw, Geography Department, Clark University, and Clyde Kluckhohn, Anthropology Department, Har- vard University. Professor Ekblaw gave a series of lectures on the Polar Eskimo to the faculty of the Anthropology, Geography, and Sociology departments. Dr. Kluckhohn conducted a series of conferences over a three-day period on the Navajo. The Eskimo and the Navajo, among other peoples, are considered in a course given jointly by the three departments. The summer field season will be devoted to excavation of three sites in the Wolf Creek Dam Reservoir in southern Kentucky. It is planned to explore two large village sites and a small earth mound. Surface collections indicate the sites to be Woodland and Mississippi. It is hoped that some contact sites may be revealed in the area. The Alabama Museum of Natural History will excavate the Upper Creek town of Coosa this summer. This site is located on the Coosa River near Childersburg in east- central Alabama. Dr. John R. Swanton states that Coosa is one of the best documented sites on De Soto's route through the southeastern United States. De Soto visited the town in 1540 and at that time Coosa was the strongest town of the Upper Creeks. Members of the De Luna expedition vis- ited the town nineteen years later. Coosa continued to be occupied until at least 1799, and was abandoned sometime between 1799 and 1832. David L. Dejarnette, Curator of the Alabama Museum of Natural History, and Steve B. Wimberly, Archaeologist at Mound State Monument, will supervise the Coosa ex- cavations. J. C. Harrington is returning to Fort Raleigh, North Carolina to continue excavations for the National Park Service. (W.G.H.) SOUTH AMERICA New World archaeologists, particularly Peruvianists, were saddened by the recent death of one of Peru's leading scholars, Dr. Julio C. Tello.3 Dr. Tello was Director of the National Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and Professor of Archaeology at the University of San Marcos. He has been succeeded as Director of the Museum by Dra. Rebecca Carri6n Cachot, for many years Assistant Director. In the university it is reported that Dr. Fernando 3 See pp. 50-6 above Editor.</page><page sequence="9">NOTES AND NEWS 79 Ma'rquez Miranda, the distinguished Argentine archaeolo- gist, will take over Dr. Tello's post. Sr. Rafael Larco Hoyle, accompanied by his family, has been making an extended trip through the United States since September of last year. Sr. Larco has stopped in Washington and New York to visit North American col- leagues and study museum collections. He is now touring the Midwest and West. Dr. Hans Horkheimer, formerly of the University of La Libertad, Trujillo has gone to the University of Arequipa to give a series of conferences in prehistory. Mr. Richard Schaedel, graduate student of the Depart- ment of Anthropology, Yale University has recently com- municated concerning his own and other researches in Peru and Bolivia. During the latter part of 1947 Schaedel, accompanied by his wife, conducted a survey of highland stone sculpture. He has recently completed a jeep trip through the south and central Peruvian sierra, stopping en route to cross the Bolivian line and visit Tiahuanaco and La Paz. From the University of San Marcos, students of Dr. Jorge C. Muelle have been carrying on stratigraphic test and cemetery excavations at Ilo. In the south, Dr. Morante, of the University of Arequipa, has recently published an article describing his work at the Gloria Leche Plant site near Arequipa. Distinctive tombs at this location contained Churaj6n style ceramics. At Puno, Sr. Franco Inojosa is preparing an archaeological map of the immediate region and a summary description of the sites located. In La Paz, Sr. Max Portugal is continuing with research and writing on Bolivian altiplano sites at Copacabana, Huata, and Jesus de Machaca. In one location he has iso- lated a new style of black incised ware. Portugal has also discovered a semi-subterranean temple at Tiahuanaco which has interior walls decorated with geometric and anthropomorphic figures. An item of special interest from this area concerns a new and accidental discovery at Tiahuanaco. After the earthquake of 1947 a monolith, here- tofore unknown, was uncovered. It is reported to be in the same style as the Monolito Bennett and the famous Gate- way of the Sun. A French Mission has been represented in Peru in recent months by M. Henry Reichlin. According to plans Reichlin hopes to carry out excavations around Cajamarca and Chachapoyas. The following archaeological note from Popaya6n, Co- lombia was submitted by Dr. John H. Rowe. Dr. Rowe has been employed by the Institute of Social Anthropology of the Smithsonian Institute for the past year. He has been stationed at the Universidad de Popayin. "In September, the Instituto Etnol6gico of the Univer- sity of the Cauca and the Institute of Social Anthropology of the Smithsonian Institution sponsored an ethnographical field trip to the Indian community of Guambia on the upper Piendam6 River in the Central Cordillera. In addi- tion to the studies of modern life which were the special object of the trip, a start was made toward an archaeologi- cal survey of the area, with rather unexpected results, as previous indications had suggested that the area was not particularly promising. "Thirteen sites were visited, mostly small ones, and surface collections were made at all of them. They are all habitation sites. Some are groups of house platforms (i.e., artificially leveled areas for house sites) on the highest ridges; the largest site of this type had about a dozen platforms. Surface finds consist mostly of plain sherds and chips of obsidian and are not numerous. Occasional finds of ancient metates, stone axes, and gold ornaments were re- ported by the Indians who cultivate these sites today. The rest of the sites visited are rubbish deposits of varying depth and extension in the narrow valley bottoms. One, recog- nized by the modern Indians who call it 'Pijao town,' is the largest rubbish site so far reported from southern Colombia, about two acres in extent with three to four feet of deposit. Pottery is abundant, and perhaps ten per cent of it is decorated: painted in simple linear designs in white and red, incised, or with small figures modeled in relief. The paste of the plain sherds-unevenly fired, with many mica inclusions-prominent polisher marks on the surface, and thickened rims, are traits remarkably suggestive of 'archaic horizon' types from Peru. There was no obvious stratigraphy in the cuts inspected, but differences might well appear with excavation. The pottery described has some resemblances (shape, use of red slip) to Upper Cauca and some to sherds from the neighborhood of Popayan (painted designs), but it is not exactly like any style hither- to reported. "One tomb discovered accidentally in a house platform, was cleared to prevent its destruction. It consisted of a partially filled shaft about 2' meters deep at the bottom of which was an unaccompanied burial in bad condition. The body was that of an adult male apparently interred in seated flexed position. No side chamber was found. "The Guambia rubbish sites are notably richer than the ones so far visited around Popaya.n itself, and the sherds found are in better condition. Guambia gives every indica- tion of being an important archaeological area." Robert R. Howard, a graduate student at Yale, is con- tinuing the archaeological survey of Jamaica which he be- gan last summer as a part of that University's Caribbean Anthropological Program. He will be working in collabora- tion with C. Bernard Lewis of the Institute of Jamaica. Joint archaeological explorations have recently been un- dertaken in western Panama by the Bureau of American Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution and the National Geo- graphic Society. Drs. Matthew W. Stirling and Gordon R. Willey, working in Herrera Province from January through March, 1948, excavated four sites and surveyed several oth- ers. Of the four excavated sites, two proved to be cemeteries and habitation areas of the Cocle Period. The grave ceram- ics from these sites compare favorably with those found by Lothrop at Sitio Conte. The Conte site lies about 75 miles northeast of the Parita Zone where Stirling and Wil- ley were digging. A third site, El Hatillo, showed a different pottery style than that commonly recognized as Cocle. Al- though there are some similarities and overlap between the two, the El Hatillo polychrome style is a new one for Pan- ama. Data and materials have not yet been analyzed but it is possible that the El Hatillo style is slightly earlier than the Cocle. The fourth site excavated was a shell heap near</page><page sequence="10">80 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [1, 194&amp; the sea at Monagrillo. The pottery and stone artifacts found at Monagrillo are quite distinctive. There is no relationship to either Cocl6 or El Hatillo nor are there similarities to Veraguas, Darien, or any of the other recognized ceramic types of Panama. Monagrillo ware is very simple. Most of it is plain; a small percentage is incised. The incised sherds have vague resemblances to West Indian, early South American, and early Eastern North American potteries. This is mentioned to give an idea of their appearance and degree of technological competence, not to imply relation- ships. The complete typological isolation of the Monagrillo style in the Panamanian scene and the ecological setting of the site argue for an early relative dating. Although no stratigraphic proof was obtained, it is felt that the Mona- grillo style must be the earliest yet brought to light in Pan- ama, a region hitherto known only in terms of late archaeo- logical horizons. The annual meeting of the Institute of Andean Re- search for the year 1947 was held at 12:00 noon on Decem- ber 13 at the Harvard Club, New York City. Dr. S. K. Lothrop, Chairman, presided. In view of the increasing scope of the activities of the Institute and its members, it was decided formally to extend the field of research, as defined in the charter, to areas in Latin America lying outside the Andes proper but, never- theless, related from the standpoint of problems in pre- history. Dr. A. V. Kidder was elected Chairman for the year 1948. A Steering Committee composed of Drs. Strong, Bennett, and Steward was appointed by the Chairman to serve con- currently with him. Dr. Gordon Ekholm will continue as Secretary. Dr. Lila M. O'Neale was elected a member. Messrs. Lothrop, Kroeber, Belnnett, Strong, Steward, A. V. Kidder, Kidder II, Willey, Bird, Tschopik, Gillin, and Ekholm were in attendance. (G.R.W.) EARLY MAN According to the latest issue of the American Anthropo- logical Association News Bulletin (Vol. 2, No. 3, June, 1948), it has been discovered that "Tepexpan Man was not in natural association with the skeletal remains of an extinct elephant. Instead, the burial was of later date and intruded into the Pleistocene deposit." Dr. Paul Sears, Chairman of the Department of Botany at Oberlin College; Helmut de Terra, Pleistocene geologist who made the find; and Loren C. Eiseley, Chairman of the Department of Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania, are credited with reaching this conclusion. In a preliminary announcement of the discovery of Te- pexpan Man, published in AMERICAN ANTIQUITY in 1947 (Vol. 13, No. 1, pp. 40-4), Dr. de Terra stated (p. 41) that "The cut of the excavation showed no traces of intrusive burial nor any signs of subsequent disturbance." Further study has apparently failed to confirm this statement.</page></plain_text>
