<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIII*-MENTAL TELEOLOGY by Anselm Muiller I Doubts about a common view of teleology 1.1 Mental operations as counter-instances. In this paper I wish to question what I take to be a common view of teleology. The core of this common view consists of two assumptions: (i) The conscious pursuit of a purpose is the least dubious case of purposiveness. (ii) The conscious pursuit of a purpose is essentially reasoned or 'syllogistic' (based on a practical syllogism): it consists, paradigmatically, in an agent's doing something X for a reason, i.e. because she or he aims at Y and thinks that X contributes to Y. I shall dispute the truth of the second assumption by giving counter-examples. Since this assumption seems to be the only support of thefirst, my argument is an indirect attack on this, i.e. on the idea that special problems attach to the teleology of anything other than what is done, consciously,for the sake of sonmething intended. My counter-instances are three types of case where something X is done, consciously, for the sake of something intended, Y, but this purposiveness of X cannot be due to a thought that X is conducive to Y. Why then 'mental' rather than 'mindless teleology' in the title of the paper? Well, not only does 'mental teleology' sound less *Meeting of the Aristotelian Society held in the Senior Common Room, Birkbeck College, London, on Monday, 10th February, 1992 at 8.15 p.m. 1 This part of the common view is articulated, e.g., by Donald Davidson's 1978 article 'Intending', in his Essays on Actions atnd Events (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), p. 85: 'We cannot suppose that whenever an agent acts intentionally he goes through a process of deliberation or reasoning, ... Nevertheless, if someone acts with an intention, he must have attitudes and beliefs from which, had he been aware of them and had the time, he could have reasoned that his action was desirable (or had some other positive attribute).'</page><page sequence="2">162 ANSELM MULLER disheartening as a catch phrase. It also characterizes my starting point. For my counter-instances to syllogistic teleology are, all of them, examples of operations of the mind. The type of teleology, however, that these examples require will be called unreasoned teleology. Unreasoned purposiveness is the main topic of this paper. I hope to explain in what way the mental character of the examples is relevant to my argument. At the same time I believe that it is not essential to unreasoned purposiveness. I shall in fact briefly mention (in section 5.3) another, non-mental, counter-example to the assumption that the conscious pursuit of a purpose is essentially syllogistic. I shall end these introductory remarks with a terminological point: While 'purposiveness' means a feature of things we think and talk about (teleologically), by 'teleology' I mean the kind of thought and talk that attributes purpose or point. More specifically, the teleology of an action is, in my terminology, an account of it in terms of an end to be achieved by it. And in defending unreasoned mental teleology I claim that we can account for certain mental operations in terms of their occurring with a view to an intended end but not in terms of a thought that the end would be served by such a mental doing. 1.2 Teleology: 'natural', 'intentional', and 'unreasoned'. The common view of teleology that I wish to question goes with a dichotomy. It distinguishes between conscious and non-conscious pursuit of a purpose. In the first case, an intention of the purpose is taken to account syllogistically (i.e. via thought) for things that happen, or exist, for a purpose. In the second case, neither intention nor thought come into the teleological account. This dichotomy determines two questions and two corresponding classifications. (i) We may ask of a thing whether it intends at least some of the purposes which teleology attributes to it or to its parts or functions. An affirmative answer holds for adult human beings (and for God); but not for instruments, or (as far as I can see) for animals, or plants. So much for the classification of agents on the common view. (ii) We may, on the other hand, ask of any reality: does it exist, with the features it has, because it has been thought of as conducive to an intended end? This question receives the answer Yes for typically human activities as well as for human instruments and many other</page><page sequence="3">MENTAL TELEOLOGY 163 artefacts. The answer is No, among other things, for organisms as well as for their parts and functions-unless a divine intention sets them purposes. If there is such an intention, the answer may be Yes for many other things, too, especially for the constitution of the universe including the physical constants that go into the laws which make the world we live in possible. Here we have a classification of results of final causes. The dichotomy which expresses itself in both these classifications is one of unconscious or natural and conscious or intentional purposiveness. It may well be doubted, e.g., because it does not seem to allow for an understanding of the natural but conscious purposiveness of a feeling like hunger, or of intermediate cases such as the stages between the sucking movements of the baby and those of the child. My own reason for doubting the dichotomy is that unreasoned purposiveness is neither here nor there. With natural purposiveness it shares the absence of syllogistic thought. But it is like 'intentional' purposiveness in that it involves intention of the purpose. 1.3 Purpose, intention, and cause. Sometimes, teleology is denied where there is no intention. But there is a difference. Aquinas, for example, held that you can recognize the presence of telos without recognizing an intention: according to him, philosophical reflection will show that the presence of telos requires the operation of an intention. By contrast, contemporary philosophers tend to think that you cannot really mean teleology when you do not mean explanation in terms of intention (and thought). The term 'teleonomy' has been introduced to signify what is left of teleology when you subtract the supposition of intention. And it is generally assumed that teleonomy is a convenient form of description only; what is explained ostensibly, or provisionally, by a purpose, will have to be explained, more adequately, by mentioning efficient causes. What I have to say in this paper does not presuppose a rejection of this position as applied to natural, or even all, teleology. On the other hand, I am far from defending it. I do not know whether Aquinas is right in his claim that telos demands intention. Nor do I</page><page sequence="4">164 ANSELM MULLER hold the contemporary view-which leaves a number of questions unanswered. For one thing, there is no agreement on the notion of an efficient cause, and consequently no agreement oIn what is a causal explanation. Nor does teleology seem to fare any better, on this count. On what basis do teleonomists suppose, then, that a causal explanation of the operations of a daisy, say, will be less provisional than a teleological one'? There are no good reasons. as far as I can see, for saying quiite generally, with regard to orgainisms, that in comparison with explanations in terms of final causes, explanations in terms of efficient causes are either more final or more efficient. Surely, quite ordinary predictions about the behaviour of a dog that can be made on teleological grounids cannot in fact be based on the knowledge of whatever counts as efficiernt causes. Even if it were true, e.g., that all that happens with the dog is the result of elemientary particles' operating in accordance with laws of physics, it is far from obvious that this could be found out. In particular, it is not obvious at all that general propositions containing words like 'dog', 'running'. 'barking', 'drinking' and the like could be correlated with general propositions framed in the physicists' vocabulary, in such a way as to represent effects of causes which were described in this vocabulary. It seems even more implausible that the teleology we apply to typically human operations should be correlated with, or even replaced by, a 'causal' explanation in terms of regular event sequences. I do not wish to spend time discussing the problems that beset this topic. I shall presuppose the teleology of typically human operations and try to show that some of it is unreasoned rather than 'intentional' in the sense of syllogistic. If unreasoned teleology turns out to be appropriate as an account of certain typically human operations, this may diminish the temptation to regard natural teleology with suspicion. Natural teleology cannot then be dismissed for not being intentional in the sense of the dichotomy, as it shares this 'defect' with the respectable teleology of some typically human operations.</page><page sequence="5">MENTAL TELEOLOGY 165 II Practical reasoning and its purpose 2.1 Action and reflection. one purpose, two teleologies. My first type of case concerns the relationship between practical reflection, thinking, reasoning and the end which the reflecting is about. Consider a simple example of a purposeful human action: NN buying a set of records in order to learn Italian. NN has reflected that her wish to learn Italian will be best served by listening to the spoken language and that buying the records will enable her to do this. Now it is plausible to say that NN's purchase is for the sake of her learning Italian in virtue of her practical thought. It does not matter, here, whether by this 'thought' we mean NN's reflection, which the example assunmes has occurred in connexion with her wish, or rather a belief, a disposition actualized by the reflection. The point is the syllogistic interpretation of the purposiveness of NN's performance. And my claim is that this way of accounting for the purposive character of an action cannot be generalized. The very reflection deployed by NN, this bit of practical reasoning, provides a counter-instance. Like the purchase itself, the reflection that leads to it is for the sake of learning Italian. NN reflects with a view to discovering appropriate means to this end, she discovers them with a view to implementing them, she implements the means with a view to the end itself; hence she reflects with a view to learning Italian. But, unlike the purchase, the reflection is not plausibly said to befor the sake of her learning Italian in v,irtue of some practical thought of hers. 2.2 No second order practical reflection. For what practical thought should this be? If NN's reflection is a means to her end 'in virtue of some practical thought', it is so by virtue of a reflection (or belief) other than itself. Could it result, as a 'practical conclusion', from a second order practical thought that took the form 'I wish to learn Italian; a way (or: the only way) of finding out how to achieve this is to reflect on appropriate means; so let me reflect on appropriate means'? (For simplicity's sake, I shall henceforth call this a second order reflection. The argumnent I armi engaged in still applies when the second order practical thought is taken to be a belief; compare the end of section 3.2.)</page><page sequence="6">166 ANSELM MULLER Supposing the practical reflection just formulated to be an acceptable practical inference: would the second order reflection give the first order reflection (how to learn Italian) its purposive character? It would seem to do this by providing us with a purpose-learning Italian-which it presented as the further intention with which NN did her first order reflecting. In fact, however, that second order reflection provides for the purposive character at best of NN's reflecting on means of learning Italian in general, not of her particular reflection, which brings in hearing the language spoken, and buying records. But it is this particular first orderreflection which happens for the sake of learning Italian. The particular thoughts are purposive with respect to the end. Hence, if the purposive character of the first order reflection is to be syllogistic, it will have to be inferred in a more specific second order reflection: 'I wish to learn Italian; a way (or: the only way) of finding out how to achieve this is to reflect that my wish to learn Italian will be best served by listening to the spoken language and that buying some records will enable me to do this; so let me reflect that my wish to learn Italian will be best served by listening to the spoken language and that buying some records will enable me to do this'. This second order reflection would not merely be awkward: the very idea of such a reflection is incoherent. For it purports to relate to the first order reflection as an object of thought. And this is a problem when the first order reflection is represented by a conception of its very content. In the example, the occurrence of the first order reflection as an object of the second order reflection is explicit in just this way. So the first order reflection is present in the second order reflection not just as an object of reflection but as part of it. We have, here, a case of what may be called the transparency of the mental. You cannot reflect that it would be useful to reflect that p, without reflecting that p, any more than you can remember that you want to remember X, without remembering X. So the idea of the second order reflection in the example is incoherent. Such a reflection purports to yield, in its practical conclusion, the performance of a mental operation-the first order reflection-that is already being performed in the course of the second order reflection itself. So much for my main argument to show that reflections on how to act to attain some end fall under unreasoned teleology. They are</page><page sequence="7">MENTAL TELEOLOGY 167 purposive with regard to this same end without sharing the syllogistic purposiveness of the actions they yield. The essence of this argument will recur in connexion with my next case of unreasoned human teleology. Before I turn to this, I wish to mention a second argument concerning practical reflection. 2.3 An infinite regress of practical reflections. This argument is simply that a regress arises if the purposive character of practical reflecting is understood in terms of syllogistic teleology.2 If, in the very act of reflecting on means to a given end, I am employing a means to this end, and every employment of means requires practical reflection, then that act of reflecting on means requires another practical reflection; this second order reflection, being itself a means to an end (to the same end, as it happens), requires yet another, third order, reflection; and so on. Unlike the first, this second argument seems to presuppose that it is always 'occurrent thoughts', acts of practical reflection, neverjust beliefs, which account for the purposiveness of a means deliberately chosen for a certain end. Both arguments concern the teleology of particular practical reflections, hence of actions. The first, however, shows that this teleology must not appeal to any further practical thought (occurrent or dispositional), while the second shows only that it must not appeal, generally, to any further (occurrence of) practical reflection. III Mental finding 3.1 Memory and the varieties of thinking of. Let us consider a second type of case (which may, in fact, be seen as an expansion of the first): thinking of something in search of something else. English seems to have no name for this particular kind of thought. In German, 'Einfall' expresses fairly accurately what I have in mind. 2 A version of this argument is developed in Anselm W. Miller, 'How Theoretical is Practical Reason?', in Intention and Intentionality: Essays in Honour of G. E. M. Anscombe, ed. Cora Diamond and Jenny Teichman (Brighton: Harvester Press, 1979), esp. pp. 96-99.</page><page sequence="8">168 ANSELM MULLER Different English expressions are appropriate for different contexts: things occur to you, they strike or hit you; you also hit on them, and you recall them; you come upon or discover them. On plenty of occasions, and in many types of context, a purpose of ours is served by our thinking of something in one of these ways. I shall be concerned, principally, with cases in which the thought occurs 'in answer to' (and, to some extent, as a result of) a search. Such thinking night be called a mentalfinding. Can you mentally find what is not in your mind? It would seem that memory is always involved somehow. This is obvious when, say, 'cardamom' suddenly occurs to you as you try to recall the name of a distinctive taste that you recognize. It is almost as obvious when you hit on the right synonyms in the course of doing a crossword puzzle. You have to be a little more creative, as we would say, to find an apt metaphor, or a good example, to use in an explanation. Memory figures less prominently when the thing you are looking for needs invention, or discovery. Constructing a mathematical proof of a conjecture, and setting a given text to a fitting tune, would be instances of this. It would be interesting to analyse the role of memory in such cases of mental finding. Understanding, too, can be mentally sought and found. We would not consider it to be particularly creative. Yet the kind of searching which one engages in when trying to understand, does not seem essentially to consist in searching one's memory. In one type of case, no support even by memory seems to be available. I mean situations when something radically new is under- stood, e.g. when a child comes to understand, for the first time, and not in terms of anything already understood, the meaning of words. I shall not pursue this example because I do not wish to get entangled in problems that are special to it. One of these is that, unlike other cases of mental finding, the radical sort of coming to understand does not seem to allow for an antecedent conception of what to look for. Ordinary sorts of understanding, like under- standing the meaning of a particular word, or getting the point of a joke, are, or can be, attained in pursuit of the aim of such understanding; they realize, or can realize, antecedent conceptions of what it is to understand a word, or to get the point of a joke.</page><page sequence="9">MENTAL TELEOLOGY 169 The sort of mental finding I have in mind, then, is not essentially reminiscence. This is of interest in that it may diminish the temptation to think of mental search on the wrong lines. For searching one's memory might be seen as connected with a physiological or otherwise unconscious scanning procedure which provides us with efficient causes of mental findings. This is not my own account of recalling something. But it might suggest itself to others as an account of 'mental finding' if this was, essentially, recalling. If, on the other hand, mental finding in general is not plausibly explained in terms of efficient causation, the special case of recalling, too, may appear in a different light. Some of this light may come from the hint that what we look for in trying to remember or understand or hit on something X etc., has the character of an end which-unless we fail!-we achieve by a means which consists in our remembering, or understanding, or hitting on an instance of X. Remembering 'cardamom' can be seen as a means (perhaps the only means) towards remembering what this coffee tastes of. 3.2 Finding: an unpremeditated means. My claim, of course, is that the teleology of mental finding, whatever its reliance on memory, is unreasoned teleology. The reason is, simply, the nature of the relationship between seeking and finding. The conception that guides your search is the conception of an end. But there is no such thing as a conception of a means by which to achieve this end. Such a conception would be the result of a mental finding: a result, that is, of success in seeking and of achieving the end. An example will serve to illustrate this. Suppose your word game requires you to look for a word beginning with a 'D' for an extinct four-footed animal. The conception of the end that guides your search is: being aware of a word beginning with a 'D'for an extinct four-footed animal. Suppose you are lucky and after a bit of mental fumbling hit on 'dinosaur'. This mental finding will then be the means by which you achieve your end-the seeking being a less immediate means resulting in the finding. Now, you could have constructed a practical syllogism containing the somewhat trivial central premise: 'Looking for a word beginning with a "D" for an extinct four-footed animal is a</page><page sequence="10">170 ANSELM MULLER (promising) means to being aware of a word beginning with a "D" for an extinct four-footed animal'. What you could not have constructed is a premise connecting your end with the immediate means, which is your actual way of achieving the end: 'Thinking of the word "dinosaur" is a means to being aware of a word beginning etc.'. The simple reason is that a belief or judgement with this content cannot account for your thinking of 'dinosaur'. This is clear for the case of the judgement: Once you judge that thinking of 'dinosaur' is a means to being aware ..., you have already implemented the means (and achieved the end). The judgement is not a step on the way to that implementation as a practical conclusion. There is nothing left to 'conclude' once the 'premise' is present in your mind. If the 'premise' is construed as a belief, it can indeed account for your thinking of 'dinosaur'. But it accounts for this thought in the way a disposition accounts for its being actualized (under suitable conditions), not in the way a belief that X is a means to Y accounts for X being done. For this to be its role, the belief has to co-operate with an inclination towards Y, the end. But in the example we are considering, the belief that X is a means to Y is quite enough by itself (under suitable conditions) for X to be performed: X (the thought of 'dinosaur') just is part of the actualization of the belief (that that thought is a means to being aware ...). The same must be said of the belief, talked about in section 2.2, that some particular practical reflection will serve as a means to a given end. By the transparency of the mental, this belief contains what the practical reflection contains. So it accounts for the occurrence of the reflection, not in the way a practical premise does, but, independently of an inclination towards the end, in the way of a disposition that gets actualized. 3.3 Searching: means to an unpremeditated end. There is another true proposition that could not figure as a premise in a practical syllogism-the 'premise' connecting immediate and less immediate means to the awareness required by your word game: 'Looking for a word beginning etc. is a (promising) means to thinking of "dinosaur"'.</page><page sequence="11">MENTAL TELEOLOGY 171 Here, the reason seems to be that in virtue of its content the 'premise' actually prevents you from the search which it suggests as a means, instead of supporting it. For consider the thought of the 'immediate means' (which here figures as an intermediate end), viz. the thought of thinking of 'dinosaur'. This thought already realizes on its own, by the transparency of the mental, the finding achievement which it purports to prepare by suggesting a search as means. It will appear that a deeper reason is found in the concept of search. Consider once more the two propositions which turn out not to provide you with premises for a practical syllogism in the service of your word game: 'Looking for a word beginning with a "D" for an extinct four-footed animal is a (promising) means to thinking of "dinosaur"' and 'Thinking of "dinosaur" is a means to being aware of a word beginning with a "D" for an extinct four-footed animal'. Putting the two together, we can infer the proposition 'Looking for a word beginning with a "D" for an extinct four-footed animal is a (promising) means to being aware of a word beginning with a "D" for an extinct four-footed animal'. I have called this a trivial premise because it is so obvious. (Not for everything that may be found is an analogous premise obviously true!) The interesting thing, however, about this premise is that it does not exhibit the paradoxical character which the two 'component' propositions assume when treated as premises in practical reasoning. This observation may suggest that the unreasoned nature of a means-end relationship is not a transitive feature: It seems to be possible that both the way in which X is for the sake of Y and the way in which Y is for the sake of Z are unreasoned, while X is employed for the sake of Z on the strength of a practical syllogism. This may be so. But the complex teleological situation just sketched seems to be a characteristic feature of the concept of search and of certain related concepts. Consider the following puzzle: 3.4 The teleological structure of mental seeking andfinding. How can you ever mentally find what you look for? If you look for X and find something other than X, you do not find what you have been looking for. If, on the other hand, you look for X and find X,</page><page sequence="12">172 ANSELM MUiLLER what is the difference between the states you are in before and after the finding? No difference is forthcoming where the aim is a mental finding. For in this case, looking for X is looking for a thinking of some item. Now, looking for it involves thinking of it. But thinking of the thinking of an item involves thinking of the item itself. Nothing is added to this when you finally find what you have been looking for. The argument is, of course, sophistical. The air of paradox disappears when we consider the conceptions involved in mental seeking and finding. Let A be the conception with which you start out. (In the example, A = word beginning with a 'D'for an extinct four-fboted animal.) For a conception B to count as what is found, B has to be a conception of something which also satisfies conception A. (B = expression dinosaur'.) This relationship between A and B is responsible for the fact that fiiding B is finding what was sought, i.e.A. So, 'what is found' has, in a way, two meanings: one is determined by the conception you start with (A), the other by the conception you come up with (B). Since the latter conception cannot, by the transparency of the mental, be in your mind while you are engaged in the mental search, it cannot occur in your awareness of the teleological structure which connects your means (a search for A) with your aim (finding A). But, supposing you are successful, your coming up with a find (B) will of course in fact be part of the teleological nexus. Moreover, you are aware of this fact, in an oblique manner, while seeking. For it is part of the concept of a mental search that in seeking A you aim at finding A via coming up with something falling under A. Here you intend the initermediate elenment of this teleological niexus obliquely-under the conception: falling under A; there is no intending it directly-under the conception you actually come up with: B. The teleological structure I have sketched is not peculiar to the context of mental seeking and finding. Mutatis mutandis, it shows, e.g., in the contexts of (non-mental) seeking and finding, requesting and receiving, asking and being told. A variation on the example of asking and being told will riow be treated as a third type of case of unreasoned teleology.</page><page sequence="13">MENTAL TELEOLOGY 173 IV The point of judging 4.1 Aiming at tr-uth. What do we mean if, following Aristotle, we say that truth is the telos of theoretical thought? We mean, at least, that judgement has a point that is intrinsic to any judging and more fundamental than any further purpose it may have, and that at least part of this point is the truth of the judgement. So, if you judge that all plants need water you do this with an intention of judging truly that all plants nieed water. The further intention may be, for instance, to have an example of a true general statement in your logic class, or to be ready for an ecological discussion. In other cases, the purpose of forming a judgement on some matter could be to convince more easily, or to annoy somebody, or to create a confused situation. And it may be thought that sometimes one could pursue such a purpose by forming a false judgement. But this is a confusion. It mcay happen that a particular purpose is in fact served by a false judgement. This is the case when I happen to do the right thing, or something I intend, because of a mistaken judgement. It may be the case, too, when I trick myself into forming a belief by which I justify an attractive course of action. But these are not cases of intending falsehood, and certainly not of intentiornally judging falsely. I may wish, for sonme stranige reason, to form a false judgement. And so, my false judgement nmay, in a sense, be voluntary. But there is no such thing as judging with a view to being wrong. But neither do we speak, it could be objected, of judging with a view to being right. This may be so. What matters, however, is this: If you are told to form a judgement, say, on the costs of building a swimming pool for a medium sized town, there is no room for you to ask (even yourself) whether to form a true or a false judgement. There is of course plenty of room for you to ask yourself whether to speak the truth or not. But if yoL decide, for whatever reason, to lie, your lie will rely on the presumption of truie judgement. There is also room for you to be incoinpetent to form the required judgement. Do you, in this-case, form a judgemnent without aiming at truth? No. We nmay here distinguish two types of case. Suppose, first, you are unaware of your incompetence. Then you will simply</page><page sequence="14">174 ANSELM MULLER aim at truth and be likely to miss. Suppose, on the other hand, you are aware that you are incompetent. Then, whatever you actually do or think you are doing, you will not in fact be forming a judgement on the matter in hand. You will either suspend judgement, or guess, or wonder, or the like. None of these is judging. There is, finally, room for you to be mistaken. For this reason forming a judgement is not the same thing as forming a true judgement. But trying to form a judgement is the same thing as trying to form a true judgement. The combination of these two observations gives sense to the claim that we judge with a view to being right, or that truth is the intrinsic point of judgement. 4.2 Understanding sentences. All this seems to be connected with the role that judgements play in our lives. Such a claim sounds implausible if we wish to attribute judgements to God. But then, God's judgements would not admit of the distinction between telos and performance that is typical of ours. So the claim should be that the intrinsic telos of human judgements must be understood in terms of the role that judging plays in human life. This claim is risky enough. For we must not expect that we have determined what judgements are for, once we have determined what assertions are for. And what could be called the role of asserting, or of judging, in human life? But one thing seems clear: We identify judgements by understanding (and making understood) sentences that express them; to understand these sentences we need to know the circumstances for which their utterance is meant; and these include only circumstances in which the sentences and the judgements they express are true. Hence a thought is not called a judgement unless the thinker means it to be such that its expression is meant for the circumstances that obtain, i.e. unless the thinker means it to be true. To know, then, what a judgement is, or what judgement a particular judgement is, you have to know its telos-which it may not achieve but is of necessity meant to achieve. 4.3 In answer to a question. An adequate teleology of judgement cannot stop at truth as its entire telos. There are any number of judgements, each with its particular telos. Any particular judgement</page><page sequence="15">MENTAL TELEOLOGY 175 aims at the truth about a particular topic. (This is a rough formulation. Strictly speaking, one and the same judgement provides answers to a number of particular questions.) We may further suspect that it is essential to judgement that in general, though not universally, it relates to a question that has somehow 'come up'. Not any old voicing of an arbitrary indicative sentence expresses a judgement. And in very exceptional circumstances only would it make sense to say that someone formed a number of consecutive judgements all with the same content. So some interest, or presumption of interest, in a topic on which to inform oneself or others seems in some way to be constitutive of the very judgement. Its teleology has to include something like an aim of answering a live question. 4.4 Judging and guessing. Even so, our teleology of judging is not complete. So far, nothing has been said which would distinguish judging from guessing. A guess, too, seems to aim at truth and to concern a particular topic. To get a clearer account of judging let us consider the differences. A first difference between judgements and guesses concerns the respective ways in which they relate to truth. The more a guess approaches conjecture, the more obviously it is intrinsically aimed at truth. At the other end there is he mere guess, which does not even rely on the most indirect or general evidence; here you can only hope for truth, not really intend it in your opting for one of the possible answers. You may therefore allow extrinsic aims to determine the contents of such a guess. (In order to please a child who has just learnt to count up to 10, you may comply with its whisper in your ear and guess 10 in answer to someone's request: 'Guess the number between 1 and 25 which I have just thought of.') Even so, we may say that truth is an overall telos of guessing, in that the point of the practice requires the wish, in general, to guess right. (In speaking of a practice I am ignoring, and going to ignore, the case where, failing any evidence, a practical necessity requires guessing. Such guessing is a limiting case of conjecturing. In a way, it preserves the purposiveness of judging. For if some available piece of evidence turns out to have been neglected, it will not do to say: 'Well, I was guessing, wasn't I?'.)</page><page sequence="16">176 ANSELM MULLER What about interest in the topic? This is not essential to guessing in the way it is to judging. The interest we take in guesses need not be connected with their contents, and it varies. We may guess when pressed for an answer which we do not know. Most characteristically we guess when prompted by a request to take a guess, or in the context of a bet, and, quite generally, in game-like situations. A third feature distinguishes judging from guessing. Roughly speaking, judging and guessing alike aim at truth about a particular topic, but unlike guessing judging aims at knowledge about this topic. In general this means that judging correctly on account of adequate evidence is part of the point of judging. 'In general'. For I do not wish to exclude propositions certain beyond justification from expressing judgements. If it were not for this case, adequate evidence would seem to be demanded by intention of truth. In forming judgements, then, we intend to be right in the right manner. And in general this means: to be right on account of adequate evidence. This is why you require the conviction of a relevant competence for your thought even to count as a judgement. The point of guessing requires no competence. Unlike judgements, guesses are not competent or incompetent. So there is no room for a conviction of competence to go with guessing. The intrinsic point of judging, which includes awareness of its truth, does require the competence that is provided, at least in general, by evidence. So your thought is a judgement only if it involves the intention of this point and, therefore, a conviction that you have the required competence. 4.5 The wider context. There are at least three ways, then, in which the teleology of judging differs from that of guessing: judgement is intended to be true in every particular instance; judgement must, in a general way, spring from an interest in its topic; and judgement intends knowledge. All these differences seem to be aspects of a deeper distinction. Judgement connects up immediately with the business of living. In virtue of this context judgement is itself a serious business (even though individual judgements may be frivolous). With judgements, the defining standards of adequacy are part of that connexion. Not so with guesses. If we neglect conjectures and sheer guesses that go proxy for judgements merely because evidence is scarce or</page><page sequence="17">MENTAL TELEOLOGY 177 unavailable, guesses are in no way indispensable in the life of humans. They typically form part of games or similar extras, whose point determines separate standards of adequacy for their elements. In most cases, guessing may be seen as such an element, a kind of mock judgement which gets transformed as it gets transferred from the serious context of the requirements of human life. This view of the matter seems to go well with a consideration concerning animals. We are often in a position to attribute to an animal what Dummett calls 'Proto-Gedanken'. It is the knowledge of its goals and an observation of its movements which allow an inference towards its proto-judgements. There is no inference towards proto-guesses. Guesses are far less directly connected with the rest of life than judgements are. 4.6 Judging and its unreasoned teleology. It is not difficult to see why judging that such-and-such is the case is an example of something humans do with an end in view without being an example of something they think of as a means to it. The argument, foreseeably, consists in showing the absurdity of treating the judging as the result of a practical syllogism. Suppose your aim is to find out whether it is true that p. Now, given the teleology of judgement, this end is achieved by judging that p, or that not-p, as the case may be. So, given your end and your awareness of the action by which to achieve it, you should perform this action, i.e. judge that p, or that not-p. The trouble is that your judging in this way cannot be seen or reconstructed as a practical conclusion resulting from your striving for truth as to whether p, together with your belief that this truth is achieved by judging that ... For the purported practical conclusion would be nothing but ajudgement actualizing the belief which was to play the role of premise. Once again, the belief does not provide you with a practical premise since there is no need here of a special intention to achieve truth, in order to get to the performance of the judgement. The essence of this argument is somewhat different from that of the argument I have applied to the first two types of unreasoned teleology. In the present case, it is not the mere conception of the means which would anticipate, by the transparency of its content, the purported practical conclusion. Rather, the content of the entire</page><page sequence="18">178 ANSELM MULLER would-be premise connecting end and means entails the content of the judgement whose performance is the means. Let us go back to an earlier example and consider the content of the 'premise', viz. Judging that all plants need water is the only way of judging correctly concerning the question whether they do. This content entails the content of the judging which would constitute the practical conclusion of a practical syllogism if the teleology of judging were syllogistic, viz., All plants need water. To disentangle the various judgements a little, let us say the would-be premise expresses a 'decision' how you ought tojudge. The entailment is then due to the fact that in deciding how you ought to judge you cannot help judging also as you decide you ought to judge. To elaborate this a little, let me introduce a supposition: You actually decide that truth as to whether p is obtained only by judging that p. Can you do this without judging that p? It may seem that you can, on some indirect evidence, in case you do not understand the proposition indicated by 'p'. But a natural reading of the original supposition excludes this possibility. It is presupposed, then, that you understand the proposition indicated by 'p'. But in this case, it is by forming the judgement that p that you come to the supposed decision that truth as to whether p is obtained only by judging that p. You may decide that this is the right way to behave in a certain situation and yet not behave this way. But you cannot decide that this is the right way to judge concerning a given topic without thereby judging this way. V Implications 5.1 Results. I have presented and discussed three cases of mental teleology for which the 'common view' with its dichotomy of natural and intentional teleology does not cater. They confirm my claim that certain human operations show a kind of purposiveness which I call unreasoned. What is done with unreasoned purposiveness is not 'natural' in that it is done with a view to its purpose. It is not 'intentional' in that it is not done on account of a thought which would present it as a means to that purpose.</page><page sequence="19">MENTAL TELEOLOGY 179 What is here called 'intentional teleology' relates to actions based on a practical syllogism. It does not provide for actions which are both purposeful and intentional but not performed for a reason. My 'unreasoned teleology' applies to such actions, of which judging is an example I have been discussing. But it also applies to mental doings which one would hesitate to call intentional; 'mental findings' are of this kind. I submit that doings of this kind should be seen as voluntary. For they are inseparable from an awareness of their own purposiveness; and they are actually meant, by the agent, for the purpose which they have. This purpose is either chosen by the agent (as when you mentally look for something) or a matter of natural inclination (as when you understand something without having sought understanding). So whatever exhibits unreasoned purposiveness, whether done intentionally or not, is done with the consent which is characteristic of the voluntary. And where the purpose is chosen, unreasoned purposiveness also goes with the characteristic capacity not to do what serves the purpose. Unreasoned teleology has to be accepted if syllogistic teleology is. This is perhaps most obvious when we consider the example of a practical reflection which is not itself performed as a practical conclusion of an antecedent reflection. Such a practical reflection occursfor the sake of the purpose which it is about, no less than its practical conclusion (some action) is going to occurfor the sake of this purpose. Yet, ex hypothesi, this action comes under syllogistic teleology, the reflection does not. Where does this leave us with respect to the claim that teleology, as applied, e.g., to non-human organisms, is anthropomorphic? Well, the legitimacy of unreasoned teleology removes a foundation stone of this claim. For it is the role of reason in typically human teleology which is alleged to give substance to the claim that we are wrong to find the purposiveness characteristic of our own performances also in the operations of creatures which lack reason. Unreasoned teleology, however, applies to operations which straddle the dichotomy. On the one hand, they are typically human in that their purposes presuppose reason; and in their performance the agent is necessarily conscious of the purpose. On the other hand, these operations are</page><page sequence="20">180 ANSELM MULLER innocent of being conclusions of the practical syllogism which, on the 'common view', is a condition for genuine teleology to apply. So the mere absence of this condition cannot be a reason for rejecting natural teleology as anthropomorphic. If there is any room for teleology at all in a decent ontology, it should not be the teleology of human operations only. 5.2 Testing for teleology. It might appear that I am straining teleology in applying it to the kind of mental occurrence I have been considering. In order to dispel this impression I must draw on the notion of telos without being able to say what is a sufficient condition for something to be a telos, or for something to be for the sake of one. However, the following two aspects will, I hope, be admitted to be central to that notion: (i) If X is for the sake of Y, X tends to contribute to, or be constitutive of, the existence or some feature of Y. (ii) The fulfilment of this tendency is, perhaps apart from the quality of Y itself, the standard by which the occurrence and the properties of X are evaluated. Unreasoned teleology seems to meet these criteria. In particular, all the cases I have been considering allow forfailure in the sense of the second criterion: practical reflections about an end may be lacking, or inadequate; you may fail to hit on what you look for; a judgement may amount to error instead of knowledge. And to anticipate an example from the next section: an action may fail to be what it is intended to be. 5.3 Teleological variety. To avoid misunderstandings I should make it quite clear that I do not mean to suggest that all mental occurrences fall victim to my unreasoned teleology. Nor do I claim this type of teleology for all purposeful mental occurrences. Pain might be called a mental occurrence, but its purpose is natural. If you do a sum in your head, this mental occurrence is likely to be purposeful in the 'intentional', syllogistic way. I do not, on the other hand, claim that all cases of unreasoned teleology follow a uniform pattern. The arguments of sections 2.1-4.6 suggest a difference in the ways in which, e.g., coming up with a mental find and judging that p function as 'means'. Still, these arguments are all about purposes in the realm of the mental</page><page sequence="21">MENTAL TELEOLOGY 181 and rely on its transparency. But nothing has been said to exclude the possibility of unreasoned teleology concerning non-mental items. In fact, I suggest that quite ordinary human actions exemplify it. Take any ordinary individual action ('action token') A which corresponds to an intention to do X. X, however specific, could be executed in ways other than A. So A is a way of doing X, rather than identical with it. Moreover, A is judged for adequacy by reference to X rather than the other way round. So A can be said to be performed for the sake of X-by way of unreasoned purposiveness. For, on the one hand, the purposiveness of A is not natural: it is due to a choice (of X) and voluntary. On the other hand, it is not syllogistic: it cannot be due to the agent's thought that X must be done and A is a way of achieving X. And this is so because A cannot be thought about without being performed. Now the formulation 'cannot be thought about without being performed'reminds us of the transparency of the mental. But this time it has to be read differently. A must be being done, or have been done, if it is to be an object of thought. For only the existence of Aallows this 'action token' A to be an object of thought. (Any specification of A yields a conception of X, or of a more specific action type. Either way, the conception is not as such a conception ofA.) So A is voluntarily done with the purpose of doing X, but this cannot be the case on account of a thought that A is a way of doing X. The purposiveness of A is unreasoned. As I have observed before (section 3.4), its structure resembles that of the purposiveness of mental finding in that the purposeful doing itself is intended only indirectly, or obliquely. But unlike coming up with a mental find, A is a physical doing. In introducing a category of unreasoned purposiveness, I may give the impression that I am replacing the dichotomy I ascribe to a common view of teleology, by a trichotomy. In fact I believe that (i) there are intermediate cases and transitions, and (ii) an overview of types of teleology will have to be worked out in connexion with a deeper understanding of what teleology is and how it relates to accounts in terms of efficient causes.</page><page sequence="22">182 ANSELM MULLER 5.4 Perspectives. To conclude, I shall mention some questions that arise in connexion with these two suggestions, and exemplify the further use to which unreasoned teleology might be put. (i) I have already drawn attention to the existence of transitional stages in the purposeful behaviour of a baby that is growing up. And what I have called 'radical understanding' does not seem to fit easily in the categories of natural or unreasoned teleology. We may also ask whether nothing remains of the natural teleology that applies to birds' building nests and singing, when we try to account for human beings' constructing huts and conversing. Such cases raise the question what shape a teleological theory should take in order to accommodate both natural and intended purposes (and, thereby, intermediate cases, too). (ii) We may need a rather diversified account of ways in which things have purposes. Here are some questions concerning the teleology of mental items: hunger seems to have a purpose in the natural way that pain has; but, more clearly than pain, it is, or involves, a desire. Are we to say that the satisfaction of a physical desire is its natural purpose? And what then about desires arising from conceptual knowledge? Should we attribute purposes to dispositions? Should we say, e.g., that a belief aims at truth much in the way a judgement does? How does teleology relate to a theory of efficient causes in terms of tendencies? Could such a theory reconcile, in particular, a syllogistic teleology of human actions with the attribution to the wants and beliefs involved of a causal role? (iii) Unreasoned teleology might throw a little light on such questions and on some notorious problems in the philosophy of mind. To give an example, I shall end by sketching the beginnings of an answer to the question why judgement and belief are involuntary.3 Consider the question whether you could choose to judge that p for a reason, namely (i) because judging that p (rather than not-p) serves 3 Compare Jonathan Bennett, 'Why is Belief Involuntary?',Analysis, Vol. L, No 2, March 1990, pp. 87-107.</page><page sequence="23">MENTAL TELEOLOGY 183 the intrinsic point of judging whether p or not-p, or (ii) because judging that p will get you something (external to its intrinsic point), or (iii)-if this is a choice-for no reason at all? The first possibility is excluded by the argument of section 4.6. The second possibility requires that your thought that p be both a judgement-which involves intention of awareness of its truth-and determined by some other purpose. But, the topic once settled, this other purpose is of no relevance to the way you judge. The content of the judgement is determined by the point ofjudging once you trust the evidence; and your thought fails to be a judgement if you ignore or do not trust the evidence-however much you may wish, for the sake of that other purpose, to judge that p. (You may-in some way voluntarily-allow that purpose to make you trust the evidence. But, again, the purpose is no reason for choosing to judge that the evidence is trustworthy.) Similar considerations exclude the possibility of an unmotivated choice. You may choose to have a guess at a number, and you may choose to guess: ten. You may choose to form a judgement as to whether p, but there is no choosing to judge that p. In this sense, judging is not intentional. But in judging, e.g., that all plants need water, you do intend to make a true judgement as to whether p. For this reason I should say, as suggested in section 5.1 and pace Bennett's question, that judging that such-and-such is in fact voluntary. But since its purposiveness is necessarily unreasoned, you do not intend it in the syllogistic way in which you intend ordinary performances. If belief is a disposition to judge, it will a fortiori not admit of a purpose in the sense of 'intentional' teleology. I believe it is, in general, voluntary. But to argue this is another matter.
