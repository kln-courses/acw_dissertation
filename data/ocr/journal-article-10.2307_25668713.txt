<plain_text><page sequence="1">NORTHERN CHEYENNE ETHNICITY, RELIGION, AND COAL ENERGY DEVELOPMENT by Gregory R. Campbell ABSTRACT Energy development on reservations and tribal lands has created considerable controversy among tribal members and between tribal members and the energy companies. During the early 1970s, exploration began on the Northern Cheyenne reservation to assess the viability of coal strip-mining operations. The leasing of Northern Cheyenne reservation land for potential energy development spawned considerable controversy and resistance among many Cheyenne people. They per ceived the alienation of their land as a threat to social identity. Using political symbols derived from the Northern Cheyenne cosmology and religious ceremonies, the Cheyenne resisted proposed strip mining operations. INTRODUCTION From the perspective of Native Americans, the history of the United States can be char acterized as a three-hundred-year process of dispossession and exploitation of their lands and culture. By the close of the nineteenth century, most of those Native Americans who survived this colonial encounter were con fined to reservations. This reservation land, in many instances, was the "least wanted given the technology and economy of the United States at the time of the closing of the frontier" (Berkhofer 1981:35-6). Isolated geo graphically and culturally, Indian reservations were in essence ethnic enclaves ? ethnically homogeneous arenas where cultural tradi tions were maintained and perpetuated (Cas tile and Kashner 1981). The tenacity with which some Native American groups have maintained their social identity is reflected in their continuation or revival of religious ceremonies despite the assimilationist poli cies of the federal government (Liberty 1965a, 1967,1968; Moore 1974; Powell 1969; Weist T. 1977). Today, many Native American nations are faced with another threat to their cultural existence ? energy development. As Anglo America depletes its store of non-renewable energy resources, those Native Americans residing on energy-rich landbases have been called upon to share their wealth through participation in the national political economy (Irvin 1982; Jorgensen 1984; Jorgensen et al. 1978; Stanley 1978; Swenson 1982). The question around energy development for the Northern Cheyenne exceeds the ob vious material issues of economic benefit and environmental impact. Like many Native American nations across the United States, the Northern Cheyenne were threatened by colonization by multi-national energy corpora tions (Parfit 1980). The onslaught of these corporate giants created what Turner (1974: 35) has called a social drama, where ? "conflict seems to bring fundamental aspects of society, normally overlaid by the customs and habits of daily intercourse, into fright ening prominance." In social drama, religious symbols have greater social relevance. Ethnic survival becomes a political phenomenon whereby traditional customs become mechanisms for political action (Cohen, A. 1976:4). The symbols derived from this "social drama" perpetuate not only a sense of social identity, but also solidify a collective identity to con tend with the perceived threat to the group's continuing ethnic existence. These religious symbols are transformed into symbols of resistance (DeVos 1975:13). The coal con troversy on the Northern Cheyenne reserva tion both threatened the native society and struck at the core of Northern Cheyenne traditional religious beliefs regarding their 378</page><page sequence="2">relationship to their environment and their conceptual system of the physical world. There is general agreement among an thropologists and other social scientists that there exist qualitative differences in cultural perceptions of the environment (Nabokov 1981; Straus 1977). In all cultures some references to space or environmental features are endowed with symbolic significance. Since meaning is not an intrinsic quality of physical space, the differences in our atti tudes toward the relationship between hu mankind and the physical world proceed from a cultural experience (Momaday 1976:80). In general, to much of Native America, space is symbolically endowed with moral-religious meaning: (It) is heterogenous ? each of its various consti tuent parts possesses differentiating symbolic qualities. Various parts of space or environmental features differ in the degree to which they convey socioreligious meaning and hence in their relative sacredness (Cohen, E. 1976:57). This sacred relationship to the physical world is a matter of reciprocal appropriation; ap propriation in which humankind invests itself in the environment, and simultaneously incor porates the environment into humanity's most fundamental experiences (Momaday 1976: 80). NORTHERN CHEYENNE COSMOLOGY: THE SYMBOLIC TRANSFORMATION The foundations of Cheyenne religious belief derive from the prophecies of Sweet Medicine. This culture hero gave the Cheyenne a social contract wherein all in dividuals comprehend their relationship with their society and the universe (Turpin 1975:160). The teachings of Sweet Medicine hold human relationships and spiritual development as the highest of virtues. These cultural values are expressed and renewed by the performance of Cheyenne ceremonies (Moore 1974, Powell 1969). The ceremony which renews the powers in the Cheyenne "Universe" is the Arrow Renewal Ceremony (Liberty 1965b; Dusen berry 1956; Turpin 1975). The Sacred Arrows are the symbolic integrator; they symbolize the Cheyennes' prosperity and welfare and guarantee the authority of the Council Chiefs and Arrow Priests (Hoebel 1960). In comple mentary relationship to Mahuts (Sacred Ar rows) is Issiwun, the Sacred Buffalo Hat which renews the substance of life and the source of subsistence. Whereas Mahuts symbolically represents the male principle in the Chey enne "Universe," the Sacred Hat embodies the female principle (Moore 1974; Powell 1969; Turpin 1975). These ceremonies are mechanisms for order which integrate the sacred and the profane within the cosmology. The cosmo logical and social universes are structured and maintained in proper symbolic order through ceremonial performances. The Chey enne have a moral obligation to maintain themselves in proper symbolic relationship with their "Universe" or face the destruction of their society. Therefore, Cheyenne believe that they have the ability to control their destiny, as their history is intimately bound to their sacred way of life (Powell 1980:xi). The Northern Cheyenne "Universe" (Hes tanov) is divided by the earth's surface into the "World Above" (Heamahestanov) and the "World Below" (Atonoom) (Fig. 1). Each of these realms is divided into several regions, of which the highest and most sacred is the "Blue-Sky-Space" (Otatavoom). The second level of the "Universe" is referred to as the "Nearer-Sky Space" (Setovoom) which in cludes everything between the "Blue-Sky Space" and the "Atmosphere" (Taxtavoom) ? the air in immediate contact with the "Earth-Surface-Dome" (Votostoom) (Moore 1979:2). The "Nearer-Sky-Space" is me diates between people and the sacred forces of the "Blue-Sky-Space." This region is filled with sacred atmospheric agents and messen gers which stand in relation to the major forces of the "Universe," and to Ma?he?o, the "All-Father." (Grinnell 1972:88-89; Moore 1974). The "Atmosphere" covers the "Earth's Surface-Dome." The lower limit of the "Earth's-Surface-Dome" is reached when there is no longer any life. It is the region beneath the root systems of the Plains grasses. Below the surface is "Deep-Earth" (Nsthoaman). This region is considered sterile ? exposed cliff faces, deserts, and badlands are considered "Deep-Earth" (Moore 1974, 1979:2-3). 379</page><page sequence="3">HESTANOV: THE NORTHERN CHEYENNE UNIVERSE: Maheo A (Gift of Life) * Otatavoom (Blue-Sky-Space) - &gt;^ -"-?-^^^ n o /-^S&gt;V / / / ^C/Notanota jc-a / / / yr\ too / / / / \ ^ aj :s / / / / \ ^ Setovoom (nearer-Sky-Space) - / ~7-|- \ ^ W QnxsQvaty s / s E o Taxtavoom (Atmosphere) - \ ^-?7-//^/Hesenota J ?

Hestanov: The Northern Cheyenne Universe (Sources: Grinell 1972; Moore 1979; Powell 1969; Straus 1977). The symbolic contrast between Votostoom and Nsthoaman is reflected during the perfor mance of the Sun Dance by the removal of sod exposing Nsthoaman. Cottonwood trees for example, are considered sacred because their roots extend though Votostoom into Nsthoaman. This is one reason for their use in constructing the Sun Dance Lodge (John Moore, Personal communication). Pervasive throughout the Cheyenne "Uni verse" is a male-female continuum. At its extremes, "Deep-Earth" is considered princi pally female and characterized by its material nature, as opposed to the maleness and spiritual qualities of Ma?heo?o, who supplies the gift of life. Within these realms exist spiritual beings who manifest themselves as birds, animals, spirits of the dead, and other natural phe nomena. These spiritual beings are ordered heirarchically and interact with living North ern Cheyenne (Moore 1979, 1986; Powell 1969:437-440; Straus 1978:4). The most prominent of these spirits are the Four Sacred-Powers (Maiyun) (Powell 1969:435). Each of these powers is associated with a cardinal direction, has certain physical qual ities, and is associated with a sacred color. The east (Hesenota) brings light, warmth, and the creation of new life. Hesenota's color is white. Similarly, the west (Onzsovata) is associated with the color yellow which rep resents perfection, ripeness, and beauty. On the other cosmic axis, the south (Sovata) brings warm weather, rains, and good for tune. Sovata is represented by the color red. In contrast, the north (Notamota) whose color is black, is associated with inertia, death, and coldness (Moore 1974, 1979; Powell 1969; Grinnell 1972). These Four-Sacred-Powers are called upon in prayer "to guide, direct and instruct Cheyenne on the surface of the Earth" (Straus 1977:350). The Powers vac illate in relative strength with the winter and 380</page><page sequence="4">tr ?^ v^!^^V A Deer X ^c^^y * V \ Ashlahd 1 Busby O Vj / [7 */?\ s \ A* 5 ; J 5 \ 2 V ? a a ; o / o ( ? ._ ^ Birney k.

Like the environment, contemporary Nor thern Cheyenne society is structured and merged within the sacred realm. Every Cheyenne individual proceeds on a 'journey of life' which is a model for behavior through out the life cycle. According to Straus (1977:335), the life stages ? from birth to death ? are associated with the Four Direc tions and four earth colors: The directions and colors are "master sym bols" ... in Cheyenne culture, organizing and orienting individual lives. Those who have "lost The Way" may be redirected by a medicine person who makes clear the structure and mean ing of Cheyenne life by demonstrating these associations in a variety of rituals, actions, and prayers. Essentially, the "traditionalist" perception of the environment is alive, sacred, and ordered symbolically into a dynamic system with cultural and religious significance. To maintain harmonious order in the "Universe" and in Cheyenne society, traditional people must continually draw upon this sacred power as the Cheyenne world stands in constant need of renewal (Powell 1969:443). Thus, Northern Cheyenne ceremonies reaffirm so cial solidarity, customs, beliefs and values (Weist, K. 1971:34). They place the Cheyenne in proper symbolic relationship to their "Uni verse". To many contemporary Northern Cheyenne, features of the geographical en vironment are evaluated in terms of their nearness to the sacred or the extent to which they symbolize it. Through proximity, profane physical space is transformed into sacred socio-religious space. NORTHERN CHEYENNE ECONOMIC UNDERDEVELOPMENT 381</page><page sequence="5">The Northern Cheyenne reservation was delineated in 1884 along the Tongue and Rosebud rivers in southeastern Montana (Fig. 2). Since the reservation's establishment, economic development has been uneven under shifting governmental policies, with poverty and underdevelopment continuing to the present day (Anderson 1951; Dusenberry 1956; Hodge 1981; Svingen 1982). During the early years of the reservation, the Cheyenne were expected to become farmers. Because of poor geography for agriculture, however, most Northern Cheyenne subsisted, in the early years, on government rations (Hodge 1981; Weist T. 1977:114). In the first decades of the twentieth century, cattle ranching was introduced on an individual basis. With a change of agents, a tribal herd was formed between 1914-1924. Afterward, despite the success of the enterprise, the project was disbanded in favor of agricultural pursuits (Svingen 1981). By the Great Depression, the Northern Cheyenne landbase had been frag mented by allotment and leases, disrupting the integrity of their economy. This period is described by Cheyenne elders as a time of alcohol abuse and breakdown of family life. To halt this process of cultural and economic disruption, the Sacred Buffalo Hat was opened September 23, 1930 to restore order to the secular and sacred realm. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 ended allotment and created a Tribal Council which was given authority to make decisions of cultural, political and religious significance. The establishment of the Council in 1936 broke down traditional Cheyenne values of consensus politics. The period of 1945 to 1950 was one of poverty, isolation, and little discernable change. With an average income of $1,421, many Northern Cheyenne were actually living at a baseline subsistence economic level (Bureau of Indian Affairs 1950; Dusenberry 1956; U.S. Dept. of Interior 1951). Poverty persisted into the 1970s. Despite an average family size of 5.37 persons, a median family income of $5,270.00, and an unemployment rate of 25%, the Northern Cheyenne rejected the energy development plans for their reservation (Bureau of Indian Affairs 1973, U.S. Dept. of Commerce 1974). THE COAL CONTROVERSY AND THE RIGHT TO BE NORTHERN CHEYENNE The reservation comprises approximately 447,000 acres of which 262,000 are tribally owned. The majority of the remaining acreage is alloted to individuals. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce report of 1974, the tribe's income from mineral resources totalled $300,000.00 annually, with farming providing the rest of the income (U.S. Department of Commerce 1974:282-84). The population of the reservation consisted of about 4,600 Northern Cheyenne with 440 non-Indians residing on the reservation (Bureau of Indian Affairs 1973:4-8). Coal deposits on the reservation are part of the Paleocene Fort Union formation. Ap proximately twelve major coal beds are within the reservation boundaries and contain an estimated 50 billion tons of coal. The coal is sub-bituminous, and the coal seams in some areas are 65 feet thick (Heffern 1980:77). Between 1966 and 1973, under the super vision of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and a few Tribal Council members, over one half of the reservation was leased to a number of national and multi-national cor porations; the most important was Peabody Coal Company (Boggs 1982). The Cheyenne were to receive for their loss of resources $2,250,000.00 or approximately $9.00 per acre. All of the leases were drawn up at the Bureau of Indian Affairs District Office in Billings, Montana, without the knowledge of most Northern Cheyenne people (Toole 1976). When the Peabody test-core drilling rigs showed themselves on the reservation, it was to the complete surprise of many Northern Cheyenne. Most people were naturally angry and concerned; " . . . their very identity is bound up in their land, this move threatened their existence" (Hodge 1981:211). The concern was over the environmental damage caused by the test-core drilling operations. Considerable surface and property damage occurred and the drilling affected ground water levels (Toole 1976; Woessner et al. 1981). This environmental disturbance, for many Northern Cheyenne, meant the distor tion of the proper symbolic order of the "Universe," and the Sacred Hat was opened in an attempt to restore order. 382</page><page sequence="6">Another concern over energy develop ment was the growth in the number of non Indians on the reservation. In a household survey, 89% of Northern Cheyenne respon dents believed the increased presence of non-Indians was undesirable (Nordstrom et al. 1977). As one tribal member sharply stated: We've got our tribe's whole history and culture right here ... I think I would rather be poor in my own way of life than be rich in a torn-up land where I am outnumbered ten to one by strangers (Ashabranner 1982:93). Despite the fact that coal development offered the possibility for economic improve ment, many Northern Cheyenne vehemently opposed the coal companies' development plans. To halt the leasing practices, the Cheyenne organized the Northern Cheyenne Landowner's Association. The Association lobbied successfully for the Tribal Council to terminate all existing coal leases (Toole 1976:45). Combining sound legal advice with "tra ditionalist" principles, traditional Northern Cheyennes and the Tribal Council moved toward the dissolution of the leases. The legal efforts of the Northern Cheyenne moved them into a contradictory maze of federal regula tions. The Northern Cheyenne Allotment Act of 1928 stated that the mineral rights were reserved for the tribe for a fifty-year period subject to the approval of the Department of Interior. The legal situation was complicated further by the 1972 Northern Cheyenne vs. Hollowbreast decision (Supreme Court Re porter 1976), which held that individual Indian allotees had no vested interest in minerals and could not prohibit exploration, drilling, or development. While working amidst this legal maze, an Osage lawyer, George Crossland, discovered that the leases were in gross violation of federal law. The 1936 Northern Cheyenne Charter stated that the tribe could not enter into any leases that were detrimental to tribal grazing or natural resources. Also, the 1969 Code of Federal Regulations set guidelines stating that no leases could be implemented prior to the examination of the impact of sur face mining on cultural, recreational, scenic and historic resources (Toole 1976:56-7). On the advice of Crossland, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe hired the Seattle-based legal firm of Zionitz, Pirtle, Morrissett and Ernstoff to seek the dissolution of the coal leases and permits. While legal research continued, in 1971 a Northern Cheyenne delegation,on invitation of the Hopi, visited Peabody coal operations on Black Mesa in Arizona. The delegation witnessed firsthand the destruction of Hopi sacred land (Clemmer 1978). The visit rein forced their view that the threat of coal development went far beyond the concern of environmental destruction. In Montana, the Northern Cheyenne visited the gasification plants in operation at Colstrip, only 25 miles north of their reservation. After the visit, the former Arrow Keeper proclaimed: "I think that if many if these stood on our land, they would make the sun black. I do not think the Cheyenne could live under a black sun" (Ashabranner 1982:105). For the Northern Cheyenne, the destruction of their land in this manner would have serious consequences from the standpoint of sacred cosmology. Strip mining operations would transform Votostoom to Nsthoaman ? from living earth to dead earth ? through environmental disruption. Votostoom is inhabited by living things which are useful, where humankind derives its material and spiritual existence. In contrast, Nsthoaman characterized by spir itual inertness and biophysical sterility (Moore 1974:161-164). Thus, strip mining operations would have created a material and spiritual world which would have been uninhabitable from the Northern Cheyennes' cosmological perspective. The plans for the construction of gasifica tion plants on the reservation would have similar symbolic ramifications for the Northern Cheyennes. Ma?heo?o, primarily through the sun (Atovsz) and rain (Nemevota), causes Deep-Earth each spring to regenerate living plants and animals upon the earth's surface (Moore 1979:3). The sun is considered an anthropomorphic being which is associated with Hesenota, the spirit of the east. Atovsz is associated with new life, renewal, and bringing of blessings to humankind (Moore 1974:151-154). To block out or blacken the sun by pollution from the gasification plants would severely disrupt the Northern Chey ennes' cosmological cycle of renewal and ceremonies. In 1973, while on Bear Butte and 383</page><page sequence="7">before transferring the Sacred Hat Bundle (Issiwun) and its religious responsibilities to another Northern Cheyenne, the Keeper of the Bundle reflected upon the symbolic and cultural impact of coal development: There is much sickness, hardship and struggle, many untimely deaths and also dissension among our people. Worst of all, there is great danger of losing our homeland to the coal companies that want to strip-mine our coal deposits. This will maim and ruin the lands given to us by Ma?heo?o, and it will ruin the lives of our people. We need new leadership, a new sense of direction, and strong spiritual guidance to help us keep our identity and the best of our way of life. Most of all we need leadership to keep our land. We must not lose our land; for without it we will disappear one by one, until there is not one of us left (Powell 1981:1274). Clearly, the destruction of their landbase by energy development would permanently alter the religious and cultural relationship in the world for traditional Northern Cheyenne. In July of 1972, another leaseholder, Consolidation Coal Company, announced plans for the construction of four gasification plants on or near the reservation to be fed by 30 million tons of coal extracted from an additional 70,000 acres of reservation land. The announcement prompted quick, decisive action by the Northern Cheyenne people against all leases. All coal leases enacted up to 1972 were in violation of most provisions set forth in the 1936 Charter and 1969 Code of Federal Regulations. No social or environmental statements were ever compiled. In addition, the leases exceeded the 2,500 acre limit set forth in provision 25 of the Federal Code (Toole 1976:57-8). The illegality of the leases, as Josephy (1976:88) noted in the Black Mesa controversy, clearly demonstrates how: All the planning, testing, negotiations, and lease and contract signings associated with the different elements of the huge power complex were carried out so quietly that they provide a classroom example of how serious has become the lack of accountability by government agencies working hand-in-glove with industry in the United States today. On March 5, 1973, the efforts of the Northern Cheyenne who opposed the leases were rewarded. The Tribal Council voted 11 to 0 to direct the Bureau of Indian Affairs to terminate all of the coal leases and initiate a comprehensive study of the impact of energy development. The decision had come a year after the visit to Black Mesa (Clemmer 1978:33-4). The legal petition reached Secretary of Interior Rogers Morton who quickly and quietly hedged a statement of aquiescence. By 1974, the leases were regarded as illegal on the grounds of the acreage limitation provision (Fixico 1985). This decision left the Northern Cheyenne the option to sue the Federal Government or the coal companies for alleged violations. The Tribal Council opted to sue Peabody and other coal com panies- backed by Federal support. The companies " . . . couldn't believe that the land, the quality of the environment and Cheyenne culture meant more than a stack of dollars" (Ashabranner 1982:104). Pea body, to avoid the suit, attempted to renego tiate the illegal leases, only to be rejected. The Northern Cheyenne's position was aptly summarized by a council member who stated: An illegal contract is not negotiable. It cannot be bandaged up . . . The Cheyenne do not have the landbase for sustaining the population as it is. And we do not work toward the goal of eliminating our people and our reservation (Toole 1976:47). CONCLUSIONS Today the controversy of energy develop ment is far from over, but the Northern Cheyenne, through their concerted action, counted a decisive legal "coup." They set a legal precedent for other Native American nations facing similar dilemmas. Fighting for their cultural existence is nothing new for the Northern Cheyenne. The Cheyenne have resisted Anglo efforts at conquest and cultural annihilation throughout their history (Sandoz 1953; Grinnell 1977; Liberty 1965a; Powell 1969, 1981; Stands in Timber and Liberty 1967; Sootkis 1976; Weist T. 1977). Their mobilization behind the coal issue, although overt political action, was imbedded in symbolic religious principles. From this perspective, the coal issue was seen as a sacred cause to maintain the Cheyenne "Universe" and culture. The symbolic-sacred nature of the contro versy and its political implications was aptly put into perspective at Custer Battlefield, June 25, 1976. American Indian Movement 384</page><page sequence="8">spokesman Russell Means referred to an earlier mineral craze on the Northern Plains ? gold in the Black Hills. He said: Custer came into our country and invaded us for gold . . . Today we have a more sophisticated invasion by corporate giants. The issue is the same ? mineral wealth. This time it is coal (Liberty 1980:129). The focal point for Northern Cheyennes' political action was the symbols derived from their cosmology. Their political resistence maintained the most important ingredient of Cheyenne social identity. In the words of Ruby Sootkis, who testified at the Northern Cheyenne Air Quality Redesignation Hearing, January 17, 1977: You know we are being surrounded, not by Blue Coats or Custer now, but by the coal com panies ... I am here to speak from the cultural point, from the Cheyenne way of life ... We are sitting on top of the coal that people want. . . and I don't think the Cheyenne people are going to surrender that easy . . . We can survive as the Cheyenne people in holding onto what makes us Cheyenne . . . (Nordstrom et al. 1977:66-8). In sum, Northern Cheyenne social identity is seen as intimately bound to their symbolic relationship to their environment. This rela tionship is expressed in their "world view" and religious ceremonies. As the late John Woodenlegs (1979:57) expressed it ? "when we talk about the Cheyenne way, we are talking about a way of life, a way of being. Our way of life is a spiritual way." Thus, to the Northern Cheyenne, the issue was not wholly economic or political, but a "battlefield" filled with sacred meaning and consequences for ethnic survival. EPILOGUE: SWEET MEDICINE'S PROPHECY The prophecies of Sweet Medicine fore told the Cheyennes' potential cultural extinc tion. Sweet Medicine proclaimed: Strangers called Earth men will appear among you. Their skins are light colored and their ways are powerful. . . They will travel everywhere, looking for the stone which our Great Grandfather put in the earth in many places . . . They will try to change you from your way of living to theirs . . . They will tear up the earth, and at last you will do it with them. When you do, you will become crazy, and will forget all that I am teaching you . . . He's going to erase your tribal ways (Turpin 1975: 137-141). The contradictions among economic un derdevelopment, corporate colonialism, and cultural committment continue today. In August of 1980, the Northern Cheyenne tribe, by tribal referendum, voted for an agreement with the Atlantic Richfield corporation. On May 23, 1980, a gas and oil agreement was signed by the Northern Cheyenne Tribe with the Atlantic Richfield Corporation (ARCO). The contract gave ARCO exclusive rights to explore for and develop oil and gas reserves on the reservation for 33 years (Boggs 1984:206). The results of the referendum give evidence of a possible shift in Northern Cheyenne values and beliefs toward the envi ronment and their symbolic relationship to it (Sootkis and Straus 1981). The change from Northern Cheyenne traditional values was succintly addressed in a Declaration of Survival drafted by politically active Northern Cheyenne at the First Annual Gathering for the Survival of Our Northern Cheyenne Homelands, June 29-30, 1982: The Cheyenne, Arapahoe and Lakota Nations have come together again in this sacred land of the Cheyenne. The three allied nations came together for sacred ceremonies and to express our concern of our children and our mother, the earth ... We can not rely on the federal and tribal governments or courts to protect that which our ancestors died for. We must, once again, rely on our ancestor's ways and turn to each other. . . The Cheyenne Nation has forever sought to live in peace. Now we are being surrounded by massive strip-mining. We are in the way of the white man's progress once again, but this time, our own people are willing to exchange our land and tribal future for short-term benefits. Once again, a number of Northern Chey enne opposed the ARCO energy agreement, basing their argument on traditional religious principles. Charles White Dirt, a 75-year-old tribal elder, said after visiting an oil well in Wyoming: There are lights day and night and just bare land. No nature. The smell of oil and gas is bad and the water is damaged underneath. I look after the younger generation (Ackland 1981). The more culturally conservative faction of the Northern Cheyenne perceived the 1980 agreement as a religious and cultural threat 385</page><page sequence="9">(Parlow 1983). Despite these recent events, the Northern Cheyenne have so far escaped the sacred and cultural consequences of energy devel opment. The Atlantic Richfield Corporation in August of 1983, opted to phase out its ex ploratory drilling operations on the Northern Cheyenne reservation (Northern Cheyenne Tribal News 1984). Although the Northern Cheyenne have terminated their economic relationships with the energy corporations, their mineral resources, like those of many Native American nations, will be the targets for future development when it becomes economically beneficial (Churchill 1986:8-12; Snipp 1986a, 1986b). The Northern Chey enne will grapple once again with the conflict between the sacred relationship to their land and the economic benefits of energy devel opment.
