<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Jacob Allusions in John 1:51 JEROME H. NEYREY, S.J. Weston School of Theology Cambridge, MA 02138 With his characteristic insight into the history of gospel texts, R. Bultmann stated that John 1:51 stemmed from the evangelist's later redaction of the Gospel.1 In the light of recent studies by J. Louis Martyn and Raymond E. Brown on the history of the Johannine community,2 Bult- mann's suggestion deserves fresh attention. My hypothesis about John 1:51 is as follows: (a) 1:51 is a later addition to the Gospel, coming from the period of the community's history distinguished by its high christology; (b) the Jacob allusion in 1:51 designates the disciples as Jacob-like vision- aries who will see a theophany, as Jacob did; and (c) the title "Son of Man" is understood in this level of the community's history as referring to the divine Jesus. I. The Secondary Character of 1:51 Picking up on Bultmann's suggestion about the secondary character of 1 The Gospel of John (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1971) 105-6; see R. E.

If we ask when these promises of Jesus were fulfilled, we get diverse answers. The signs-source material and the Cana miracle in particular fulfill the promise to Nathanael that he would see "greater things than these" (1:50). The promised vision of 1:51 is never literally fulfilled in the gospel,4 yet the spiritual insight commensurate with the vision is reflected in confessions of Jesus as a divine figure (see 1:1-2; 20:28). 5 The climactic title "Son of Man," which is introduced by Jesus himself, is juxtaposed to the list of previously confessed titles ("Lamb of God," 1:36; "Messiah," 1:41; "Son of God, King of Israel," 1:49). Not only does the manner of presentation of the titles change in 1:36-50 and 51, but their basic content is different. Disciples who evangelize other disciples in 1:35-49 announce to one another the various titles which J. Louis Martyn has shown are distinguished as titles of a "low christology," i.e., an early confession which basically states that Jesus is but a man, albeit Messiah, Prophet, and King.6 But in 1:51 Jesus himself reveals the new title, "Son of Man," which as we shall see, reflects a high christology, the confession of Jesus as a divine figure. A pattern, moreover, is established in 1:35-40 which is broken by v. 51. In 1:35-50 a succession of spokesmen is presented preaching Jesus: They speak to disciples, relatives, and friends; they name Jesus by a title; and they invite the hearer to "come and see" for himself. Alternately, when they do come and see, Jesus confirms their interest either by inviting them to stay with him (v. 39), or by giving them a new name (v. 42), or by praising them (v. 47). 7 In contrast, 1:51 is a plural address, directed not to any individual follower but to all the followers. It is neither an invitation to come and see nor an evangelization of them; rather, it is a prediction of a future vision to be seen by them. It is formally prefaced by the "amen" formula.8 The earlier "come and see" pattern is transcended, for they have come and seen Jesus 3 For discussions of this evidence, see R. Bultmann, The Gospel of John , 105-7; R. E. Brown, The Gospel according to John , 88-89; and J. L. Martyn, "Glimpses," 151-57. 4 E.

Westcott {The Gospel according to St. John [London: John Murray,</page><page sequence="3">588 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 44, 1982 and there is still more to see (see oij/eaôe). Jesus himself takes the initiative in revealing a new title for himself - a title which surpasses all previous attempts to identify him. It is especially in the Jacob allusion that 1 :5 1 can be seen to be different from 1:35-50. Nathanael was praised as a "true Israelite . . . without guile" (1:47). As Bultmann has shown, this need not be anything more than a popular designation of praise.9 On the level of the story, Nathanael is an "Israelite," a term which contrasts him with Jesus' enemies, "the Jews."10 His guilelessness, moreover, is to be explained from the pattern of Nathanael's faith, which is contrasted with the rejection of unbelievers. (1) He knows the apostolic preaching about Jesus, especially the claim that Jesus fulfills the Scriptures (1:45); (2) he poses objections to the proclamation from Scripture (1:46), yet these objections do not prevent him from further inquiry; (3) he "comes and sees" for himself, despite difficulties (1:46b). In this he is sharply contrasted with "Jews" who likewise hear the proclamation but object to Jesus' messiahship from the Scriptures (see 7:27, 41-42, 52) and fail to come to him.11 Nathanael, then, typifies both the process of "searching the Scrip- tures" for Jesus (see 5:39, 46-47) and the overcoming of exegetical objections from the synagogue in applying OT texts to Jesus. He is like Jacob, not the devious character who grabbed his brother's heel at birth and stole his birthright and blessing, but the perfect Jacob, the man of wisdom.12 Like Jacob, Nathanael comes "second," after the founding apostles; he must labor for his reward; he is clever and enterprising (see Genesis 29-30). There is simply no evidence to suggest at this level of the story that Nathanael is like Jacob as "one who sees God." 1908] 48) remarked on the double "Amen": "The words by their emphasis generally presuppose some difficulty or misunderstanding to be overcome; and at that time mark the introduction of a new thought carrying the divine teaching further." 9 R.

Michaelis, "Joh. 1,51, Gen. 28, 12 und das Menschensohn-Problem," TLZ 85 (1960) 567. 10 The "Jews" are under considerable censure from the point of view of John's Gospel, and yet "Israel" is a favorable term (see 1:31; 3:10; 12:13). John seems to reflect the same favorable use of "Israel" as found in Rom 9:4; 11:1; 2 Cor 11:22; Gal 6:16 (see 1QS 9:6); see S. Pancaro, "The Relationship of the Church to Israel in the Gospel of St John," NTS 21 (1974-75) 396-405, esp. pp. 398-401; R. T.

Not just Nathanael, but all the disciples are promised a vision like Jacob's vision. Indeed, they are like Jacob, not in guilelessness or cunning, but in virtue of a gratuitous promise made by Jesus that they would see a com- parable heavenly vision, a theophany. They are the true "Israel" - they will "see God." Thus, in virtue of the juxtaposition of ovļ/rļ with oysoGe, the difference in the titles in 1:35-50 and 51, the broken pattern, and especially the Jacob allusions in 1:47 and 51, the last verse of the first chapter should be judged as a secondary addition to the passage. II. The Theophanies of the Divine Logos, Jesus It is commonly agreed that John 1:51 in some way alludes to Jacob's vision in Gen 28: 12. 13 The points of comparison and contrast deserve closer consideration. In Gen 28:12 three statements are made: (1) a ladder on earth reaches to heaven; (2) angels ascend and descend; and (3) the Lord stands on it and reveals himself. In John 1:51, however, (1) the heavens are opened, but there is no mention of a ladder linking heaven and earth; (2) angels ascend and descend, not on the ladder but on the Son of Man; and (3) he corresponds to the Lord of the theophany. This comparison allows us to sift out lasting suggestions from the welter of interpretations offered by com- mentators on the use of Gen 28:12 by John. Jesus is apparently not being compared with Jacob in John 1:51. He is not seeing a vision; he is offering one. Rather, the disciples are cast in the role of Jacob, for they will see a heavenly vision just as Jacob did. Commen- tators who take seriously the allusion to Gen 28: 12 suggest that the function of the vision in John is to be understood in terms of some sort of media- tion or communion between heaven and earth.14 But the ladder, which figures so prominently in Jacob's dream, is not mentioned in John 1:51. The disciples will look directly into heaven, so there is no need for a ladder to mediate between heaven and earth. Still other commentators suggest that, from traditions about Gen 28:12 found in targum and midrash, Jesus is 13 See C. F. Burney, The Aramaic Origin of the Fourth Gospel (Oxford: Clarendon, 1922) 115-16; H. Odeberg, The Fourth Gospel { Uppsala: Almqvist and Wiksells, 1929) 33-36; C. K.

According to proponents of these ideas, Jesus is the gate of heaven, the ladder, the mediator.</page><page sequence="5">590 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 44, 1982 depicted in 1:51 as the Shekinah made present,15 as Bethel,16 or as the glory of God.17 This is an important suggestion for it calls attention to the object of the vision, and suggests that the heavenly Jesus corresponds to the appear- ing Lord in Gen 28:12. Thus far the allusions to Gen 28:12 in John 1:51 suggest that the focus is on a vision of a heavenly figure; that the angels ascend/ descend toward this heavenly figure, not on a ladder; and that Jesus corresponds to the appearing Lord in Jacob's theophany. This implies, then, that Jesus will appear to his disciples in a theophany, just as the Lord appeared to Jacob. The last suggestion must be seen in the light of several other arguments in John. First, it is emphatically maintained that "no one has ever seen God" (1:18). 18 This absolute exclusion would seem to apply to Moses; for, as Wayne A. Meeks has argued, John 5:37 would seem to be undercutting even Moses' Sinai visions.19 Nor has anyone ever ascended to heaven to see God or receive heavenly revelations (3: 13). 20 But this negative insistence poses a question. If Moses, the patriarchs, and the prophets did not see God, how are we to read the Scriptures which tell of theophanies to them? John's answer to this is direct: They saw the heavenly Logos, Jesus; they received christophanies. Abraham, for example, "saw the day" of Jesus (8:56). As Nils A. Dahl has shown, this refers to an experience of Abraham during his life on earth, such as the covenant of the pieces (Gen 15).21 Although Abraham is credited with prophetic visions of the future (see Matt 13:17; Heb 11:13), John's text is not referring to a vision of Jesus-who-is-to-come- as-Messiah; for the text continues with the astounding statement that Jesus was not a mere future figure revealed to Abraham but rather a contemporary of Abraham, nay, a pre-existent figure: "Before Abraham was I AM" (8:58). 15 Both in the prologue (1:14) and later on (12:41), Jesus is described as the Shekinah made present; see R. E. Brown, The Gospel according to John , 486-87. 16 See I. Fritsch, "'Videbitis . . . angelos Dei ascendentes et descendentes super Filium hominis' (lo. 1, 51)," V D 37 (1959) 3-11; R. H.

A. Dahl, "The Johannine Church and History," 1 10.</page><page sequence="6">THE JACOB ALLUSIONS IN JOHN 1:51 591 The arguments in favor of reading "I AM" in 8:58 as the divine name22 are cogent. Now in designating himself as "I AM," Jesus is not making himself identical with Yahweh but identifying himself as the appearing God of OT theophanies. According to John's own argument, Abraham did not see God; nevertheless he saw "I AM," i.e., Jesus. Likewise, in John 12:41 it is stated that Isaiah "saw his glory." Although Isaiah prophesied about future events (see Sir 48:24-25), 23 it is commonly argued that John's text refers to a time in Isaiah's life when "he saw his glory," viz., the vision in the temple (Isaiah 6). 24 Since Isaiah, like Abraham and Moses, did not see God, what he saw must have been the heavenly Jesus. Thus an argument is established in John: (a) No one has ever seen God;25 therefore (b) patriarchs and prophets saw the heavenly Jesus in their theophanies. Returning to John 1:51, we are led to conclude that the text apparently sees the disciples of Jesus in the position of Jacob, promising them that they will see a vision just as Jacob did. The Gospel does not state explicitly that Jacob saw the heavenly Jesus, but that is a safe inference both from the examples of Abraham and Isaiah and from the argument in the text that no one (Jacob included) has ever seen God. The possibility of interpreting scriptural theophanies as appearances of Jesus is not unique to John, and it will be helpful to examine some parallel materials which establish the possibility and the currency of interpreting OT theophanies as appearances of a figure other than God-Yahweh. The testimony of Justin in the early second century is a powerful witness to such a reading of Scripture which I am claiming for John's Gospel. One of the main points of the Dialogue with Trypho is the argument that Jesus appeared to the patriarchs: Reverting to the Scriptures, I shall endeavor to persuade you, that he who is said to have appeared to Abraham, and to Jacob, and to Moses, and who is called God, is distinct from him who made all things (Dial. 56). 26 22 See H. Odeberg, The Fourth Gospel , 309-10; C. H. Dodd, The Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel (Cambridge: University Press, 1968) 94; and R. E. Brown, The Gospel according to John , 536-538. 23 R. Bultmann (The Gospel of John , 451) claims that Isaiah only saw the future glory of Jesus; on the visionary character of Isaiah in late Judaism, see F. W. Young, "A Study of the Relation of Isaiah to the Fourth Gospel," ZNW 46 ( 1 955) 215-21. 24 See N. A. Dahl, "The Johannine Church and History," 106-8; A. Loisy, Le quatrième évangile (Paris: Êmile Nourry, 1921) 378-79. 25 One might trace in Jewish sources the qualification of the OT texts which indicate that Moses saw God face to face; see M. R. D'Angelo, Moses in the Letter to the Hebrews , 97-123. 26 The translation is by A. Roberts and J. Donaldson in The Ante-Nicene Fathers (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1950), 1. 223; cf. PG 6. 600.</page><page sequence="7">592 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 44, 1982 Justin then systematically argues that: (1) Abraham's theophanies were appearances of Jesus {Dial. 56, 59); (2) Moses' visions as well (Dial. 56, 59, 60, 126; Apol. 1. 63); (3) likewise Jacob's visions (Dial. 58, 60, 86, 126). Therefore, at the end of his work, Justin is confident that he has proved: . . . neither Abraham, nor Isaac, nor Jacob, nor any other man, saw the Father and ineffable Lord of all and of Christ, but (saw) him who was according to his will his Son, being God, and the Angel because he ministered to his will (Dial. 127). Thus Justin's argument includes three items: (a) no one has seen God; (b) therefore the patriarchs saw Jesus, (c) who is rightly called God. For completely different reasons, Philo also explains that the theoph- anies in the Scriptures were not visions of God. For Philo accepts the state- ment in Exod 33:20-23 that no one can see God (De spec. leg. 1.8 §45; De post. Caini 48 §169). Therefore the theophanies were revelations of God's word or of a potency of God. In the case of Abraham, Gen 17:1 states that "the Lord was seen of Abraham," and Philo shows that the designation "Lord" in the text refers, not to God himself, but to one of the two powers in God (De mut. nom. 3 §15-17). In regard to Moses' famous request, "Show me thyself " (Exod 33:13, LXX),27 Philo repeatedly insists that Moses did not see God, but rather the "back of God" (see Exod 33:23; De post. Caini 48 §169; De mut. nom. 2 §8-9; De fuga 29 §164-65). When finally he explains what Moses saw when he was granted a vision of the "back of God," Philo states that Moses saw the glory of God, the "powers that keep guard around you" (De spec. leg. 1.8 §45-46), the same powers which Abraham saw.28 Finally, in regard to Jacob Philo gives us a fuller description of what the patriarch saw in his theophany. Although Philo admits that according to Exod 33:20-23 no one can see God,29 he likewise accepts the scriptural etymology of Jacob's special name, "Israel," as "the one who sees God" (Gen 32:28-30). 30 On the level of Philo's religious epistemology Jacob-Israel 27 The MT of Exod 33:13 reports that Moses asked, "Show me thy ways," which was changed in the LXX to èjicpáviaov jaoi aeauTÓv (Vg: ostende mihi faciem tuam). Philo inter- preted 33:13 LXX as a request to see God's essence; for discussion of this text, see M. R. D'Angelo, Moses in the Letter to the Hebrews , 179-80. 28 For a fuller treatment of Philo's doctrine on the "powers of God," see A. F. Segal, Two Powers in Heaven (SJLA 25; Leiden: Brill, 1977) 159-81; and A. F. Segal and N. A. Dahl, "Philo and the Rabbis on the Names of God," JSJ 9 (1978) 1-28. 29 De ebr. 1 1 §44-45; De migr.

And in explaining the theophanies to Jacob, Philo maintains that, while Jacob is truly called "Israel," he did not see God. Hence, in regard to Jacob's first famous vision (Gen 28:12), Jacob "saw 'the place'" (Gen 28:11). Although "the place" properly refers to God {De somn. 1.11 §63), Jacob saw the divine word, the second meaning of "place" {De somn. 1. 11 §61-62,68). When Jacob saw the ladder and "the Lord standing firmly upon it" (Gen 28:12), the "Lord" whom Jacob saw was not God, but one of the powers of God {De somn. 1.12 §70). In regard to Jacob's other famous dream (Genesis 31), when he wrestled with God and received the name Israel ("who sees God"), Philo reproduces the LXX of Gen 31:13 and proceeds to give an unusual and careful exegesis of this passage. The MT of 3 1 : 1 3 only reports God as saying: "I am the God (of) Bethel," but the LXX changed this to èyco eiļii ó 0eòç ó ô&lt;p08Íç aoi èv lórccp 0eoõ. Evidently èv lórccp Geou is translating Beth-el, "house (place) of God"; but there is no clear reason why the LXX introduced the phrase "who appeared to you." Surely the LXX intended to say no more than the MT, that the deity who confronted Jacob in chap. 31 was the same one who appeared to him at Bethel in chap. 28. But Philo reads the text quite differ- ently, for he interprets èv tótico öeou to mean that it was not God who appeared to Jacob (either in chaps. 28 or 31) but a heavenly being who appeared in place of God. This substitutionary interpretation of 31:13 then explains what Jacob saw in 28:12. Philo's substitutionary reading of èv tóttcú 0soõ creates a problem for him: "Are there two Gods, for we read 'I am the God that appeared to you,' not 'in my place' but 'in the place of God'?" {De somn. 1.39 § 228). The solution for Philo lies in the subtlety of the text which distinguishes "God" with the article (ó 0eóç) from the anarthous form (0eóç). Accordingly the holy word in the present instance has indicated him who is truly God by means of the article saying "I am the God," (Gen 31:13), while it omits the article when mentioning him who is improperly so called, saying "Who appeared to you in one place" not "of the God," but simply "of God" {De somn. 1.39 §229). 31 This means that Scripture "gives the title of 'God' to his chief Word" (ibid.). Thus the divine Word, "God" in an improper sense, appeared to Jacob in chaps. 28 and 31. And so, Jacob/ Israel saw only "the image," not God {De somn. 1.41 §241). 31 Philo repeats the same substitutionary interpretation of Gen 31:13 in De somn. 1.40 §237, apropos of justifying anthropomorphic language about God; see A. F. Segal, Two Powers in Heaven , 159-60.</page><page sequence="9">594 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 44, 1982 Philo and Justin are clear examples of the kind of exegesis of the OT theophanies which we seem to find also in John. The form of the argument in Philo and Justin is likewise important for it maintains that (a) no one can see God, (b) therefore the OT patriarchs saw a divine Logos (Philo) or Jesus (Justin), and (c) the appearing figure is "god" - according to Philo, the Logos who is given the title "god," and according to Justin, Jesus who is called God. This type of exegesis will become normative in later Christian writers, but Philo indicates that it already existed early in the first century. This part of the investigation of John 1:51 may be summarized: (a) the disciples are like Jacob and are promised a vision like Jacob's; (b) according to Gen 28:12, Jacob received a theophany, a vision of a revealing God; and since Jacob's vision in Genesis 28 is alluded to in John 1:51, John would seem to be promising a comparable theophany: the heavens opened and the Son of Man revealing himself; but (c) as Jacob and the other patriarchs did not see God-Yahweh but the Logos-god, so the disciples are promised a vision of the divine Jesus. III. The Son of Man The disciples are promised a vision of the Son of Man in John 1:51. Several questions arise apropos of the title in the context of this paper: (a) what is the meaning of the title in 1:51; (b) from what level of the Johan- nine community's history does it come; and (c) what relationship exists between the Son of Man, Jacob, and Gen 28:12? a. The Son of Man in John. Most studies of the Son of Man title concentrate on its occurrences in the Synoptic Gospels, and discussion of the Johannine Son of Man sayings is usually measured according to Synoptic categories. Synoptic classification is threefold: (a) the earthly Son of Man with authority; (b) the rejected and crucified Son of Man; and (c) the vindi- cated and returning Son of Man.32 But while capable of being viewed through these categories, John's understanding is quite different, for he lays considerable stress on the Son of Man as a heavenly being who came into the world.33 And the "vindication" of the Son of Man is, according to John, his 32 See R. Bultmann, The Theology of the New Testament (2 vols.; New York: Scribner's, 1951), 1.30. 33 See S. S. Smalley, "The Johannine Son of Man Sayings," NTS 15 (1968-69) 298; cf. E. M.

Some of the Son of Man sayings, moreover, reflect the development of the community's faith in that it is possible to identify certain traits of the Son of Man as belonging to the low christology of the early group (rejection, suffering) while other traits reflect its sophisticated high christology (pre-existence, return to former glory). For example, John 3:13-14 tells us two quite different facts about the Son of Man. The Son of Man is unique, for while no one else has ever ascended to heaven, he has.34 Indeed he has first descended from there. The Son of Man, then, is originally a heavenly figure, who alone sees God, and who ultimately returns to his former glory. This profile is equivalent to the statements about the divine Logos in the prologue,35 and it evidently reflects the high christology of the later Johannine community which confessed that Jesus is God. Juxtaposed to John 3: 13, however, is another Son of Man saying which gives us a different piece of information: ò'|/co0fj voti 5eî tòv oiòv xoö àvGpco- tīod (3:14). This reflects the same kind of tradition found in Mark 8:31, a statement about the rejected and suffering Son of Man.36 Form-critical judgments about 3:14 indicate that it reflects an early stage of the Son of Man tradition; but 3:14 has been metamorphosed in John's presentation to suggest that the lifting up of the Son of Man is really exaltation, indeed return to a pre-existent state of glory (see John 12:32-33; 17:5). John 3:13 and 14, then, contain two quite different understandings of the title in John. And they reflect a shift in Johannine christology from consideration of Jesus as a rejected and suffering man to the proclamation of him as a heavenly, even divine, figure. I suggest, moreover, that the two understandings of the title stem from different periods of the community's history. In John 5:27 it is stated that God gave Jesus authority to judge because he is the Son of Man. The passage reflects the kind of tradition found in the Synoptics about the future judgment of the Son of Man (see Mark 8:38 and 13:26), but that tradition has apparently been reinterpreted by John.37 First, 5:27 occurs in an apologetic passage where Jesus' divinity is being defended. 34 See W. A. Meeks, "The Man from Heaven," 52, esp. n. 32; see F. J. Moloney, The Johannine Son of Man , 51-59. 35 For an extended comparison of the divine logos in the prologue with the Son of Man in John 3, see my article, "John III: A Debate over Johannine Epistemology and Christology," NovT 23 (1981) 115-28; see O.

Lindars; Cambridge: University Press, 1973)</page><page sequence="11">596 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 44, 1982 The charge is made in 5:18 that Jesus "made himself equal to God"; the defense concedes that Jesus is, in fact, equal to God but it insists that Jesus does not "make himself" thus, for this is God's doing: (a) God shows him all that he does (5:20); (b) as the Father raises the dead and gives life, so does the Son (5:21); (c) the Father gave all judgment to the Son so that, as all honor the Father, they should likewise honor the Son (5:23); (d) as the Father has life in himself, so he gave the Son to have life in himself (5:26); and (e) God gave him his own authority for judgment (5:27). This Son of Man saying, therefore, functions apologetically in 5:19-29 in defense of Jesus' equality with God. Second, this authority to judge is not a future endowment of Jesus as it is in the Synoptics, for the bestowal has already happened (8s5cok sv, v. 22; sScdkev, v. 27). This authority is not to be confused with the authority of the earthly Son of Man to forgive sins (see Mark 2:10) because in 5:19-29 the Johannine Son of Man is primarily a pre-existent figure, a divine being who came into the world. The giving of authority - like other marks of Jesus' equality with God - was done while Jesus was in heaven, before his descent. It would appear, then, that a traditional statement about the Son of Man's judgment has been reinterpreted by John; the différences in meaning (the man Jesus vs. the divine Jesus) reflect the shift in John's community from low to high christology. Likewise, after the Bread of Life discourse, when Jesus is rejected both by the synagogue (6:60) and by some of his disciples (6:61), he confronts his scandalized followers and says: èàv oòv OscopfļTS xòv uiòv xov àvGpcimou avaßaivovta önov rjv to Tcpótepov (6:62). On one level, the saying reflects the tradition found in certain Synoptic sayings such as Mark 14:62, where the rejected one is vindicated at God's right hand. But here it is colored with typical Johannine elements: (a) the Son of Man first descends from heaven (see 3:13; 6:33, 41-42, 51, 58), inasmuch as (b) the Son of Man was originally (rcpÓT£pov) a heavenly figure. In 6:62, then, we find an older tradition about the Son of Man (rejected on earth/ vindicated in heaven) which is recast in Johannine terminology to indicate that the rejected one is first and foremost a heavenly figure who descends into the world.38 He is uniquely from God and uniquely sees God. 51-52; S.

Smalley, "The Johannine Son of Man Sayings," 294-95; in general, com- mentators on 6:62 tend to stress the aspects of Jesus1 ascension or pre-existence in this verse; yet</page><page sequence="12">THE JACOB ALLUSIONS IN JOHN 1 :5 1 597 Verse 62 reflects a reinterpretation of a traditional saying in terms of John's high christology. In the confrontation with the Jews in John 8, Jesus states "when you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will known that I AM" (8:28). This basically reflects the suffering Son of Man statements of the Synoptics (see 3:14 above),39 but again the saying is couched in Johannine terms: (a) the Jews reject Jesus and try to kill him because he makes himself equal to God (8:37, 40, 59; see 10:33); (b) the lifting up of the Son of Man symbolically refers to his glorification, which is his return to the former glory (see 12:23, 34; 13:31 );40 and (c) the "I AM" statement should be seen in the light of 8:58 where Jesus claims to have appeared to Abraham as the appearing deity, "I AM." Thus the tradition of the lifted/ rejected Son of Man is reinterpreted by John to refer to the divine Jesus. This examination of four major Son of Man passages in John suggests several conclusions: (a) There is embodied in John a stream of tradition about the human figure who is rejected and killed; this is judged to be a confession coherent with the low christology of the early Johannine com- munity. (b) This is juxtaposed to, or overlayed with, references to a heavenly figure who is a pre-existent, divine person and who descends from glory into the world and reascends to glory, (c) This appears to be a later development in Johannine christology. With this in mind, let us turn back to 1:51. According to 1:51 the disciples will see directly into heaven (tòv oopa- vòv àvEcpyóxa). When biblical passages speak of the "heavens opened," this language indicates that (1) the heavens open and some one/ thing descends to earth (Matt 3: 16; Isa 64: 1; 3 Macc 6:18; Acts 10: 1 1) or that (2) the heavens open and the visionary sees a heavenly figure in heaven (Acts 7:56; Rev 1 1:19; 15:5; 19:1 1; Ezek 1:1).41 The disciples see "the angels of God," who in this case are not messengers descending to earth for assigned tasks (see Acts 5:19; 8:26; 10:3; 12:7-1 1), but are angels ministering around the heav- enly throne.42 The angels, moreover, first ascend and then descend; they are already in heaven and ascend more intimately into heaven, even toward43 the see F.

Their ascent and descent in heaven designates them as belonging to the circle of heavenly figures around the throne of God (see Rev 4:4, 6-8; 5:1 1). The pattern of ascent/ descent, of course, resembles the precise direction of the angels' movement in Gen 28:12, and it seems that John intends the reader to take it quite seriously. The pattern is reversed in the case of the Son of Man in 3: 1 3, where the argument rests on the fact that the Son of Man first descends and then ascends, for he is originally a heav- enly figure (see Eph 4:9-10). In contrast, the angels of God in 1:51 first ascend44 and then descend; inasmuch as they are already in heaven (see "heavens opened"), they ascend toward the throne on which the Son of Man is seated. What are the angels doing? A midrash on Gen 28:12 gave specific tasks to these angels. For example, Tgs. Yer. I and II indicate that angels who accompanied Jacob on his journeys first ascended to tell angels still in heaven that the image of the one they guarded on earth is the same as the image which the heavenly angels see on the heavenly throne: And behold, angels that had accompanied him from the house of his father ascended to bear good tidings to the angels on high saying, "Come and see a just man whose image is engraved on the throne of glory, whom you desired to see." And behold angels from before the Lord were ascending and descending and observed him ( Tg . Neof. Gen 28: 1 2).45 Other midrashic texts speak of angels taking Jacob up (ascending) and bringing him down (descending),46 exalting him and debasing him.47 The angels in John 1:51 are not messengers, nor do they compare the throne image with the human likeness, nor do they lift up and lower the Son of Man. Their ascent and descent, I suggest, functions in two ways: (1) it points to the locus of the Son of Man figure, viz., seated on the throne of God in heaven,48 and (2) it suggests the status of the Son of Man, viz., a divine figure, even an appearing deity. picture we have then is of the heavens opened and angels from above and beneath converging on the Son of Man, the central figure." For another discussion of the throne-centrality of the passage, see G. Quispel, "Nathanael und der Menschensohn (Jn 1:51)," ZNW 47 (1956) 282-83. 44 Certain midrashic texts {Gen. Rab. 68:12 and 68:14) insist on the prior ascent of the angels. Inasmuch as there is no ladder mentioned in John 1:51, the angels are not starting from earth; nor are we ever told in John that angels ascend from earth. Unlike Gen 28:12, the starting-point of the vision in John 1:51 is not earth but heaven itself. 45 See Gen. Rab. 68:18. There are, of course, serious problems in using the targums and the midrash to explain NT texts because these works were composed so much later than the texts they are intended to enlighten; this problem will be dealt with in n. 65 below. 46 Gen.

Quispel, "Nathanael und der Menschensohn (Joh 1:51)," 282.</page><page sequence="14">THE JACOB ALLUSIONS IN JOHN 1:51 599 The focus of John 1:51, however, is not on the angels but on the figure of the Son of Man. As regards the tradition-history of this statement, it is probably based on an earlier Synoptic tradition about the enthroned Son of Man,49 but a tradition that has been completely reinterpreted by John. For example, in Mark 14:62 the enemies of Jesus who reject him as Christ are promised a vision: "You will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the throne and coming on the clouds of heaven." This vision will cause terror and fear in Jesus' enemies, for it functions as a prediction of his vindication by God, after the example of the vindication of the persecuted Son of Man in Daniel 7. 50 John's version differs from Mark 14:62 on every point: (1) the vision is not promised to enemies but to intimate friends; (2) it is not a threat but a blessing for their "coming and seeing"; (3) it is not intended to strike fear for rejecting Jesus but is offered as a reward for and the climax of their faith in him; (4) it does not tell of vindication after the example of Daniel 7 but is shaped as a theophany after Gen 28:12. Other versions of the enthroned Son of Man tradition speak of his coming to judge and of his sending out his angels to do this judgment (Matt 16:27; 24:30-31). But according to 1:51, Jesus is not coming, much less judging; he remains in heaven and gives a special vision of himself. Nor do angels fan out into the world, but according to 1:51 they stream toward the enthroned Son of Man. Although the Synoptic Son of Man was considered an exalted figure,51 there is no evidence in Mark or the other Gospels that Jesus was acclaimed as a pre-existent or a divine figure. This comparison of John 1:51 with the Synoptic tradition of the enthroned Son of Man serves several useful purposes. First, while 1:51 may ultimately be based on the kind of tradition found in Mark 14:62, it is thoroughly reinterpreted in terms of John's high christology. Second, since John's version relies more on Gen 28: 12 than on Daniel 7, there is no explicit mention in 1:51 of a "throne" or of the Son of Man "seated at the right hand of God," a lacuna supplied by the history of the tradition. That the Son of Man in John is seated on a heavenly throne is clear from the description of 49 R. E. Brown, The Gospel according to John , 89; H. Windisch, "Angelophanien um den Menschensohn auf Erden," 218 and "Joh. 1, 51 und die Auferstehung Jesu," ZNWl 1 (1932) 199-204; S. Schulz, Untersuchungen zur Menschensohn-Christologie , 122-23; C. K.

Third, the comparison reminds us that we should interpret the Son of Man figure in 1:51 in terms of Johannine characteristics. As we saw above, the Son of Man in John is primarily a heavenly figure52 who descended from glory and reascended to that same glory (3:13; 6:62; 8:28). Finally, inasmuch as the figure of the Son of Man in John 1:51 reflects not the low christology of the early Johannine community but the high christology of the later group, that verse would appear to be a later reinterpretation of an earlier Son of Man saying. The disciples are certainly not seeing the pre-descended Son of Man, nor are they seeing the Son of Man on earth (as in Mark 2: 10, 28) for they are looking into the "opened heavens"; nor are they evidently seeing the parousia return of Jesus, a tradition which is totally absent from John's gospel.53 The vision would seem, then, to be an appearance of the reas- cended Son of Man who was crucified and returned to glory. What is the function of this figure? In the Synoptic traditions the enthroned Son of Man functioned in many ways. To his persecutors Jesus promised a scene of heavenly vindication (Luke 22:68; Mark 14:62); to suf- fering Christians Jesus appeared in exaltation (Acts 7:56), presumably to comfort his followers in their trials.54 John's text reflects these traditions when the expelled blind man receives a mysterious appearance of the Son of Man and is strengthened in his excommunication from the synagogue (9:35- 38); likewise in 8:28 Jesus' enemies are promised a vision of vindication when the crucified one will truly be revealed as the heavenly Son of Man (see John 19:38 and Rev 1:7). But the promised vision in 1:51 functions not as a vindication in the face of enemies, nor is it evidently an exhortation to persecuted disciples. The fact that this Son of Man saying draws more from Gen 28:12 than from Daniel 7 suggests that 1:51 describes a the- ophany, a revelation of the heavenly locus and status of the Son of Man. It climaxes the coming to faith of the chief members of the Johannine church in 1:35-50 and points to the ultimate confession of Jesus in that Gospel as a divine figure. In this context, it may be that the phrase attributed to Nathanael, "a 52 The most important thing about Jesus is that he came from heaven; see E.

The Son of Man, Jacob, and Gen 28:12. In the Midrash Rabbah we find several instances of a reading of Gen 28: 1 2 which interpret the vision in an unusual way. The MT says that when the ladder was set up, the angels ascended and descended "on it" (n) which phrase was interpreted in the midrash to say that the angels ascended /descended "on him," Jacob.57 This midrash has often been cited apropos of John 1:51, for John says that the angels ascend /descend "on the Son of Man" rather than on a ladder.58 Following this hint, one would be led to say that Jesus is like Jacob: the angels will ascend and descend on him, just as they did on Jacob. This raises an important issue: Is there any relationship between the title Son of Man, Jacob, and Gen 28:12? Is Jacob ever called "Son of Man"? Is he ever consi- dered a heavenly figure? Returning to the midrash, we read that the angels discover a marvelous correspondence when they descend "on Jacob": His image on earth is the same as an image engraved on the Merkabah: Is it thou, (said the angels) whose features are engraved on high; they ascended on high and saw his features, and they descended below and found him sleeping (Gen. Rab . 68:12). 55 On the double character of key Johannine motifs and symbols, see O. Cullmann, "Der johanneische Gebrauch doppeldeutiger Ausdrücke als Schlüssel zum Verständnis des vierten Evangeliums," TZ 4 (1948) 360-72. 56 I suggested earlier that the christophany to Thomas in 20:24-29 might serve as the fulfillment of the promise made in 1:51; yet that very passage indicates that the typical member of John's community is expected to believe that Jesus is a divine figure through the preaching of the group and not by means of a direct revelation. For, "blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed" (20:29). On the close relationship of believing and seeing in John, see I. de la Potterie, "La notion de témoignage dans saint Jean," Sacra pagina: Miscellanea biblica congressus internationalis catholici de re biblica (BETL 12-13; Paris: Gabalda, 1959), 2. 192- 208; O.

Ezekiel's vision of the heavenly throne described four faces engraved thereon: first "a man," a lion, an ox, and an eagle (Ezek 1:10). 60 Somehow the midrash came to equate the image of the "man" in the throne vision with Jacob. Although the explanation for this is unclear, there are other bits of evidence which may shed some light on this. (1) Apropos of Gen 28:12, Gen. Rab. 68:13 interprets "the ladder" which was set up as "an image," inasmuch as "ladder" (sulām) is similar in Hebrew to "image" (semel),61 the midrash then goes on to identify two such images: (a) the "image" which Nebuchadnezzar set up as a rival to God (see Dan 3:1) and (b) the "image" of Jacob on the throne.62 (2) Jacob is occa- sionally called "man"; e.g., in interpreting Gen 28:13, the rabbis cited Prov 27:17 ("a man sharpens a man") and so called Jacob "man": "A MAN" alludes to Jacob: as soon as our father Jacob arose, "A man was together with the face of his friend," for the Shekinah attached itself particularly to him, as it says, AND, BEHOLD, THE LORD STOOD BY HIM (Gen 28: 13) (Gen. Rab. 69:2). (3) One midrash actually calls the patriarchs the "chariot of God"; interpret- ing cālāyw ("upon") in Gen 28:13, R. Simeon b. Lakish said: The patriarchs are the chariot (of God), as it says, "And God went up from upon Abraham" (Gen 17:22); and "God went up from upon him" Gen 35:13); AND, BEHOLD, THE LORD STOOD UPON HIM (Gen 28:13) (Gen. Rab. 69:3). Thus there is evidence that in some discussions of Gen 28:12-13, Jacob was called "man" in the sense that the image of Jacob was on God's throne; thus "Jacob-man" would be considered as a heavenly figure. But what kind of heavenly figure? Jacob might be considered a heavenly figure because he was a pré- existent being.63 There is a curious stream of evidence which boldly calls Jacob "god" (DEl). Much of this material is attached to Gen 33:20 which 59 On the relationship of John 1:51 and Merkabah mysticism, see G. Quispel, "Nathanael und der Menschensohn (Joh. 1.51)," 282. 60 See J.

In b. Meg. 18a the argument is set forth: How do we know that the Holy One, blessed be He, called Jacob Ell Because it says And the God of Israel called him (Jacob) El (Gen 33:20). For should you suppose that (what the text means is that) Jacob called the altar £7, then it should be written, "And Jacob called it." But (as it is not written so), we must translate "He called Jacob El." And who called him? The God of Israel. Needless to say, this interpretation was very disturbing and there are attempts in the midrash to moderate the scandal, which negatively attest to the curious Jacob = El identification. For example, commenting on Gen 33:20, R. Simeon b. Lakish remarked: He (Jacob) declared to him: "Thou art God in the celestial spheres, and I am god in the terrestrial spheres" (Gen. Rab. 79:8 and 80:4). This explanation is identical with Philo's treatment of the troublesome text in Exod 7: 1 where Moses is called "god" ("See I make you god to pharaoh"). Because of Moses' excellence he is made "god" only on earth : He appointed him as god, placing all the bodily region and the mind ... in subjection and slavery to him (Sac. 9).64 In connection with another text Jacob is acclaimed God. In one mid- rash, Gen 49: 1 is cited ("Jacob called his sons"); a second text is added from Ps 57:3 ("cry to God [DE1] Most High"), and then the parallel between the two texts is drawn out - Jacob can be called "god": Another interpretation: "I will cry out to God Most High" refers to Jacob. When his sons entered from their blessings, he began to confer distinctions upon them (Gen. Rab. 96, new version). Still a third bit of evidence occurs in a passage where Jacob commanded his body to be taken up from Egypt back to Israel lest the Egyptians worship it : BURY ME NOT, I PRAY, IN EGYPT (Gen 47:29) . . . another reason why Jacob did not wish to be buried in Egypt was they should not make him an object of idolatrous worship (Gen. Rab. 96:5). From this investigation, then, there are two main interpretations of John 1:51 available to us. I argued earlier that the disciples are like Jacob, 64 E. R. Goodenough ("The Political Philosophy of Hellenistic Kingship," Yale Classical Studies 1 [1928] 68, 76-77, 83-84) explains the use of a topos rcepì paaiXsíaç in Philo's descrip- tion of Moses as ideal king, especially in reference to Moses as a "god" on earth; for a further discussion of Philo's portrait of Moses as "god," see C. R. Holladay, Theios Aner in Hellenistic Judaism (SBLDS 40; Missoula, MT: Scholars, 1977) 109-29; fora Jewish usage of Exod 7:1, see Str-B. 2. 462-64.</page><page sequence="19">604 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 44, 1982 for they see what Jacob saw, the divine Jesus. Alternately, the midrash suggests the possibility that Jesus is Jacob (the angels descend on him as they do on Jacob), and that the disciples see the image of Jesus-Jacob on the Merkabah. But it is time to submit this last suggestion to a critique. The dating of the midrash presents a first set of problems. The composi- tion of these works is quite late, although many traditions contained in them may be dated much earlier, even to the first century.65 But in the case of the Jacob midrashic materials cited above, there is no evidence that any of those traditions existed in the first century. Hence we cannot use them reliably as interpretive background for John 1:51. Moreover, the Jacob materials we have examined represent two distinct streams: (a) via Gen 28:12, Jacob's image is in heaven, and (b) via Gen 33:20, Jacob is called DEl. It would be a mistake to merge these two traditions without further ado. It would be rash to say that Jacob's image in heaven was thought of as a divine figure. Even when Jacob is called DEl, he is never cited as acting like God, let alone revealing himself in theophanies. But John's understanding of the title Son of Man is that of a divine figure, even an appearing deity. Turning back to John's text, we should note the numerous elements there which also invite a negative judgment on the Jacob-Jesus identification from the side of the Gospel's imagery. John never mentions the ladder of Gen 28:12 or the dual image; and the vision is exclusively a view of a heav- enly figure in heaven. Hence there is nothing in John to indicate that the angels descend to earth and see an image which is likewise on the Merkabah. In John, the disciples will see the vision whereas in the midrash the angels see the image. Jesus is never equated with Jacob in the Gospel; the question is asked, "Are you greater than our father Jacob?" (4:12), but the answer boldly comes back that Jesus supplants Jacob and so is superior to him.66 Jesus, in fact, is never compared with any patriarch (see 8:53) but is pro- claimed as the one who appeared to them. Even if one admits the possibility that in the first century Jacob was called DEl, there is no evidence that Jacob-El functioned as Jesus functions in John, viz., by giving theophanies. And as attractive as it might be to link Jacob with the image of "man" on the Merkabah, there is no evidence that Jacob is called "Son of Man"67 or that this possible association would be intelligible in Johannine circles. And 65 Discussion of the date of composition of the midrashic works cited in this study may conveniently be found in the appropriate articles in the Encyclopedia Judaica (New York: Macmillan, 1971). But for a critical guide to the proper use of these works, especially in establishing the antiquity of traditions within the midrash, see R. Block. "Note méthodologique pour l'étude de la littérature rabbinique," RSR 43 (1955) 194-227. 66 See my article, "Jacob Traditions and the Interpretation of John 4: 10-26," 419-37. ö/ Yet H. Odeberg ( 77iť Fourth Gospel , 36) would link Gen 28: 12 with Isa 49:3 in terms of the glorified Son of Man; C. H.

The midrash on Gen 28:12 possibly illuminates the comment that the angels ascend /descend on the Son of Man , not the ladder, but otherwise it is foreign to John's picture, for it does not clarify the meaning of the title or the function of that figure. Summary 1. According to the literary evidence, John 1:51 is a later addition to 1:35-50. 2. In alluding to Gen 28:12, John 1:51 draws a parallel between the disciples and Jacob, indicating that they, like Jacob, will see a heavenly vision. As Jacob saw Jesus in his visions, so the disciples will also receive a theophany. 3. This should be understood in light of the pattern in John whereby it is maintained that Jesus, not God, appeared to the patriarchs and prophets of the OT. 4. The angels in 1:51 are heavenly courtiers who stream toward the throne of God. They are not traveling to and from earth, for there is no ladder mentioned in 1:51.5. The figure of the Son of Man in John undergoes a re-interpretation. There is one stream of traditional material in John which speaks of the rejected and vindicated Son of Man, which stream belongs to the low christology of the early Johannine community; but this is juxtaposed to and overlaid with another usage of the title which describes a pre-existent, divine figure who descends from glory and returns to that glory. This usage reflects the high christology of the later community. 6. As a later addition to 1:35-50, 1:51 speaks of a heavenly Son of Man who gives the- ophanies, and so reflects the high christology of the later group. 7. It would seem that the phrase "a true Israelite" would likewise be re-interpreted at this level to designate the disciples not as guileless but as "those who see God." 8. The promise of 1:51, although not literally fulfilled, is realized in the vision of faith of the Johannine community which confessed Jesus as the divine Son of Man, equal to God (5: 1 8) and as Lord and God (1:1-2; 20:28). up this idea. Midr. Ps. 8:4 calls Isaac "Son of Man"; only in Midr. Ps. 80:8 (on Ps 80: 1 8, "for the son of man whom thou hast chosen for thyself") is there any possible connection between Jacob and "son of man."</page></plain_text>
