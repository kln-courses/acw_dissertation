<plain_text><page sequence="1">Symposium of Unified Science EDITED BY THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR THE UNITY OF SCIENCE Encyclopaedism as a Pedagogical Aim: A Danish Approach BY OTTO NEURATH I NCYCLOPAEDISM" is the systematically pur- sued activity within the Unity of Science Movement, devoted to the collecting of scien- tific statements of the logic of science (synony- mous with "Philosophy of Science" for Carnap and other representatives of modern Logical Empiricism) logic, mathematics, physics, biology and other sciences, including all the "cross connections" between the given disciplines. (See: Otto Neurath, Unified Science as Encyclopedic Integration; in: International Encyclopedia of Unified Science, Vol. I, No. I.) Unified Science found on scientific statements removes all "isolated sentences", a term proposed by Reach for formulations which cannot be used for the sciences. Is such a pure scientific Encyclopaedism in a position to satisfy human yearnings and to create "oceanic feeling"-if we may use Freud's term in this case? This question will be answered by the Man of the Future. But we know some young people who like to rummage in all the 484</page><page sequence="2">O. Neurath 485 disciplines for stimulating revelations and to thumb over old and new books impelled by'an enigmatic desire to embrace the whole of human knowledge. But how rarely do scientific teachers stimulate and gratify this passion! Joergen Joergensen, the well-known author of "A Treatise of Formal Logic" (a general survey of the development of modern logic) and one of the organizers of the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science (Univ. of Chicago Press, Monographs I and 2, 1938) lectures to students of all departments at the University of Copenhagen, as an introduction to scientific argumentation in general. Since these lectures are "printed as manuscript" I am in a position to report briefly on this case of actual "Encyclo- paedism" within the sphere of a university. I only want to outline this educational work done by Joergensen so as to provide a picture of the methodological problems but it is not my task to analyse Joergensen's special empirical views. I add a few his- torical remarks which may help to characterize the intellectual en- vironment in Denmark which is, in certain sense, more similar to the intellectual environment in the United States, England, France, in the former Austria, or Poland than in Germany. It is necessary to collect material for a comprehensive history of Logical Empiricism which would be a stimulating educational aid to the preparation of general encyclopaedistic scientific courses. (For a few remarks touching on this problem, see "Le developpement du Cercle de Vienne et l'avenir de l'Empirisme Logique" par Otto Neurath. Paris: Hermann &amp; Cie., I935). The usual books dealing with history of philosophy do not reserve much space for the history of scientific empiricism. Such a history must be a special subject for books written by men of the Unity of Science movement. (See Actes Du Congres International De Philosophie Scientifique, Sorbonne, Paris, 1935, Paris: Hermann &amp; Cie., 1936, Pamphlet I: Charles W. Morris, Semiotic and Scientific Empiricism and Pamphlet VIII: Joergen Joergensen, The Development of Empiricism in Scandinavia). The name "University" is not only derived from the Latin "universitas literarum", but we find continental "Philosophische Fakultaten" which show the relics in our time of the traditional</page><page sequence="3">486 Encyclopaedism encyclopaedical ideal of the scholastic period. "Fakultat" in Europe does not mean the same as "faculty" in the United States; "philosophische Fakultit" is a gigantic department of departments, and a student can attend lectures of very different kinds within his own sphere, which is determined by the choice of the "Fakultat" only; such lectures may deal with pure philos- ophy, linguistics, literature, geography, history and social sci- ences, history of arts, theory of music, psychology, botany, zoology, astronomy, physics, chemistry, pharmacy, mathematics, logic, or other sciences. The flavor of comprehensiveness is a characteristic of such "Fakultaten" and it is not unusual that a student concerned with a special discipline frequents lectures by a professor of the same "Fakultat" who teaches a very different subject throughout his entire academic career. In the United States each single department offering graduate work is as a rule destined for a more or less specialized theoretical or practical aim; therefore if a logician gives lectures as a member of a department of philosophy he has in general a different con- tact with the students than if he were to give lectures in logic as a member of a department of mathematics. In a continental university of the old style it is assumed that lessons in logic are given for all students of the "Philosophischen Fakultit", that means for historians in the same way as for mathematicians or pure philosophers. It was an innovation in some continental universities when the "Philosophische Fakultat", overcrowded with disciplines, was bifurcated and a special "Fakultat" for Mathematics and Natural Sciences was founded, as in Copenhagen for instance. But the old tradition of "universitas literarum" remains in many cases, and we find attempts made by various universities to collect students of different disciplines for certain philosophical lectures mainly devoted to metaphysical instruction. II Every student of the University of Copenhagen is obliged to attend a special series of lectures in philosophy as part of his course of study, whatever may be the department in which he does his major</page><page sequence="4">0. Neurath 487 work. These courses are offered by different men having different points of view and emphasizing different things. Professor Joergensen has given such courses since I926-27. His main task is to lead students of all kinds to understand scientific thinking in general. He does not give a general introduction to the logic of science with certain applications, as do for instance Morris R. Cohen and Ernest Nagel in An Introduction to Logic and Scientific Method. Joergensen's students learn the "grammar of science" by seeing in what way the leading scientists found their fundamental ideas and why changes were unavoidable. The proportion of space occupied by the chapters in his syllabus is very significant: the main part of about 450 pages deals with mathematics and logic, physics, biology, psychology, history and social science,-including science of religion and linguistics. The second part of about Ioo pages explains problems of European philosophy, or more exactly formulated, problems of English, French, German, and Scandinavian philosophers. This division of the text has some very instructive consequences. Thus Leonardo Da Vinci and Galileo appear in the first part of the lectures as actual representatives of modern science who propa- gated the new ideal by their own scientific work; and while Francis Bacon, who only acted as a herald of empiricism but not as an investigator, appears in the second part. Joergensen considers thinking of primitive periods and shows the passage from anthropomorphism to modern science all through his lec- tures, especially in the sociological chapters. He explains in many cases in detail how to avoid scientific mistakes and diffi- culties bred by mysticism of various kinds. In the first lessons he comes quickly to scientific problems themselves. The short history of Greek philosophy for instance gives him an opportunity to explain in greater detail the most important mathematical discoveries of this age-this is as it were an introductory chapter on mathematics; in this connection you learn about the actual mathematical foundations and consequences of the Pythagorean doctrine of the harmony of spheres but not about the Pythag- orean eating no beans. Joergensen's pedagogical method is more or less in concordance</page><page sequence="5">488 Encyclopaedism with the historical evolution of sciences, and may be also influ- enced by Comte's theory of the stages of human thinking. Simi- larly he goes into the problems of modern physics, biology, psy- chology, and social sciences, always combining historical explana- tion and logical reasoning. We find throughout these lectures general remarks concerning details of the history of civilisation, for instance explanations about the "awe of the unknown", magical thinking, epilepsy as the basis of mystic activities, and stimulating excursions dealing with folklore and ethnography. Another kind of excursion deals with mathematical and logical demonstration. Joergensen comes from Diophantus step by step to Descartes and analytic geometry, and in this connection introduces the theory of functions. He discusses the trignometri- cal functions especially the sine curves which are well-known as an useful aid within the logical framework of the physical theories. It would be very interesting to test the results of these lectures. Joergensen's interest in modern logic gives him a very strong basis for all his argumentation. Each student of Copenhagen University who attends his lectures comes to know for instance what Leibniz performed in the field of general logic, before he learns about his monadism and theodicy. He has to hear a lot about modern logistics. Frege, Peano, Russell and Whitehead are for him more than mere names. Joergensen comes from logic to the problems of scientific deduction as an introduction to the evolution of modern physics and from the modern atomic theory and quantum theory to statistical problems in general. He discusses the formulation of natural laws, interpolation and, very cautiously, the problems of induction. Biology, psychology and sociology are deliberately explained in close connection with the different scientific publications with- out any special attempt to find a unification of the very different kinds of scientific expression in this field; this is significant of a more sceptical opinion that psychology and related disciplines are in a situation similar to that of physics before Galileo and chemistry before Lavoisier. Joergensen's students have to learn considerable biological and psychological details as a basis for criticizing the doctrines</page><page sequence="6">0. Neurath 489 dealing with teleology, vitalism, and similar metaphysical theories. We find the same attitude of empiricism in the chapter concerning historical method. It is certainly very useful for the students to learn the differ- ence between "science of religion" and "religion" itself. We know the similar difficulties which arise when people do not make a sharp discrimination between "morals" and the "analysis of morals" as a complex of formulations presented mainly in con- nection with transcendent metaphysics. The chapters dealing with science are more or less up to date. The second part of the lectures concerning philosophical prob- lems only outlines the most important tendencies in the history of philosophy. Joergensen's empiricism, which always empha- sizes the Unity of Science, developed from the English and French traditions. He is influenced by Spencer's scientific atmosphere and illustrates Criticism and Romanticism through German philosophers only, but Positivism through Comte, John Stuart Mill, Spencer and similar thinkers. Within this part of his lec- tures Joergensen discusses ethics, esthetics, and similar disciplines. I think this gives a picture of Joergensen's work. It seems to me an important problem how we can systematically redupli- cate such lectures in schools of various types and not only in universities. Such courses can be given by one teacher or by a group of teachers in co-operation. This is also a question of educational method if we define as method, all means whereby the average student can learn what previously was the result of special genius, of special personal history, and of special environ- ment. I think that many people who are interested in the Unity of Science movement and Logical Empiricism will also be interested in Encyclopaedism as the actual representation of the Unity of Science movement. An increasing number of scientists have sympathy for all these activities. A great many of them actively participate by various scientific investigations which support the bridges from science to science, by the unification of our scientific language and by the construction of Unified Science. Not a few representatives of the Unity of Science movement are multi-directionally interested in the vast mass of scientific</page><page sequence="7">490 Encyclopaedism activities in all the different fields, but only a small number of persons are well informed about certain disciplines and it is rare for one person to actively discuss problems of a great many sciences. III Joergensen's career, and a certain Danish tradition very different from the German tradition, created the basis for the unusual comprehensiveness of this empiricist. For a long time he was engaged in practical work connected with industrial organizations. One group of his publications deals with social problems of the present; another with logical investigations. More than once we found in the history of Danish thinkers an important versatility and even a certain adventurous spirit combined with cautiously sober judgment and strict intellectual discipline. All foreign intellectual influences have been very strongly modified in Denmark. What a "mutation" of German Schellingism grew up in Denmark! The famous physicist Hans Christian Oersted is a very characteristic phenomenon. This many-sided man, influenced by Schelling, carried off as a young student in one year the prize for an aesthetic problem and in the ensuing year the prize for a medical problem, the title of his doctoral dissertation was "Architectonic Structure of Meta- physics of Nature." He had great success in different fields of science, literature and politics. Since there is only one university in Denmark every energetic thinker has an opportunity to exert extensive influence, and I should think that a touch of this comprehensive romantic scientist resounds in Joergensen's anti- romantic comprehensive Scientism. Oersted's "Considerations on the History of Chemistry" are flesh of the flesh of modern Logical Empiricism. He explains for instance that certain elements which gave unity to scientific arguments are common to old fashioned mysticism and to modern science, and he demonstrates that Lavoisier's oxygen theory is not a rival to Stahl's phlogiston theory but its continuation, since both theories say that respiration is a kind of combustion, that we can put all bodies in a certain order according to their com-</page><page sequence="8">O. Neurath 491 bustibility, and that "reduction" is a chemical opposite to "combustion". Oersted admits that certain additions made to the "Symbol" X by the phlogiston people created trouble but that it is the logical structure of theories together with their empirical consequences which are most important. In this in- tellectual environment grew Joergensen's simple and hard protest against a great many persons, including leading scientists: "Hypostatization of theories may be a matter of thrilling physical novels-its value for understanding is nil". Another factor of Joergensen's intellectual environment is Harald Hoeffding. His well-known comprehensive culture and capacious work prepared modern scientific empiricism in more than one direction. His antimetaphysical psychology influenced not only Danish students and scholars. At a time in which Windelband did not even mention the name of Ernst Mach in his short presentation of modern philosophy (see his paper in the series "Kultur der Gegenwart" B. G. Teubner, Leipzig), Harald Hoeffding analysed carefully Ernst Mach's work. This in a certain sense is characteristic of Hoeffding as it is characteristic of Philipp Frank and Moritz Schlick that they very soon noticed and propagated the importance of Einstein's ideas for our think- ing in general while a great many philosophers and specialists discussed doubtfully or antagonistically the new theory of rela- tivity. This shows a special genius in knowing how to discrimi- nate significant personalities. Hoeffding quoted a statement of Ernst Mach which is well-known in the Unity of Science move- ment: 5That it would be of great importance to find a standpoint which has not to be changed if we go from physics to psychology, since all sciences together will in the future have to form a whole. It was a great pleasure for members of the "Viennese Circle" to find that Joergensen and other Danish people of our time are, like Hoeffding, very familiar with Ernst Mach's work. Joergen- sen's lectures are full of Mach's spirit, but he treats also his fundamental scientific analyses which caused Mach as prede- cessor of Einstein to help change the whole scientific thinking of our period. And last but not least, Joergensen is in a great many respects influenced directly by Niels Bohr, who is very</page><page sequence="9">492 Encyclopaedism intensely interested in the vivid growth of science as a whole and not only in the growth of physics. At the second International Congress for the Unity of Science held in Copenhagen, I936, he discussed the possibility of a more cautious language which reveal more open doors in the future of science than does our present language. He emphasized as Joergensen does the impor- tance of the Unity of Science. Bohr and his friends constitute an environment which continues an old Danish tradition of empiricism. (See: Niels Bohr, Analysis and Synthesis in Science; in: International Encyclopedia of Unified Science, Vol. I, No. I.) Joergensen is a robust empiricist, but he knows also very well the power of ratiocination within the logical framework of theo- retical constructions. We may call his attitude, according to Gregorius Itelson's terminology, "Empirical Rationalism" the counterpart to "Apriori Rationalism" which has been especially criticized by Louis Rougier. The term 'Empirical Rationalism' may be used synonymously with the term 'Logical Empiricism'. Joergensen emphasizes that all the complicated and most impor- tant scientific theorizing starts with the experience and language of our daily life, that we also have to test all the theoretical results of all the sciences by means of the same aids. Joergensen gives in his lectures not only a program of the Unity of Science but he also shows this Unity as an actuality. /The Hague, Holland.</page></plain_text>
