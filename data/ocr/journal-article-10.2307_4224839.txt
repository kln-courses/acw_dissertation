<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES J Vol. XIII No. 3 September 1979 The Limits to Growth: Is Ayres's Position Unwarranted? Baldwin Ranson Much discussion has been generated by the recent publication of Sci- ence and Ceremony: The Institutional Economics of C. E. Ayres. Its edi- tors, William Breit and William Culbertson, have successfully promoted "a rehabilitation of interest in Clarence Ayres."' Wishing to contribute to the same end, the following article critically examines one of the essays in their volume. Joseph J. Spengler's contribution to Science and Ceremony is entitled: "Limits to Growth: Biospheric or Institutional?" He addresses the vital is- sue of "whether in the long run the limits to growth lie outside man or within him, "2 whether growth must eventually cease because of absolute limits in the environment or whether it is simply retarded at times by man's institutions and limited know-how. Ayres took the second position, and Spengler finds it unwarranted. It seems that Spengler rejects Ayres's position because he finds it based on a number of scholarly failings. Spengler writes that Ayres failed to take "into account the limitedness and/or exhaustibility of natural resources" (p. 116); that he dismissed the problem posed by Thomas Malthus and did not consider the one posed by W. S. Jevons (p. 124); that he "under- estimated the significance of the changing structure of the natural resource base of the economy, of the growing importance of depletable resources whose diminution might not in the long run prove surmountable through the substitution of abundant for scarce elements and increasing economy The author is Professor of Economics, Western State College of Colorado, Gun- nison. He is indebted to Ken Powers for assistance in formulating the analysis. 655</page><page sequence="2">656 Baldwin Ranson of use of the latter" (p. 125); and that he "overlooked the degree to which the unequal distribution of critical natural resources over the face of the earth can give rise to international conflict" (p. 127). If Ayres was so wrong about the limits to growth, there would be little reason to rehabilitate interest in him. But if what Spengler implies are scholarly failings are actually parts of a coherent alternative analysis, then Spengler has failed to meet Ayres's ideas "head-on," despite the claim of Breit and Culbertson, and Ayres's alternative analysis is in need of identi- fication and examination. To establish that Ayres had such an alternative system of thought supporting his position on limits to growth is the pur- pose of this article. First, we will present the two major positions on limits to growth: Spengler's view (supported by Malthus, Jevons, and Nicholas Georgescu- Roegen) that the limits lie outside man, and Ayres's view (supported by H. C. Carey, E. W. Zimmermann, and E. S. Dunn) that the limits lie within him. These positions are illustrated by showing how each man would have answered this question: Do finite nonhuman resources limit growth? Second, we will present the two major positions on the human role in reaching limits: Spengler's view that human activity speeds our approach, and Ayres's view that human activity alone can prevent our arrival. Again, we show how each man would answer this question: Do man's activities reduce the availability of nonhuman resources? Third, we will point out the necessity of choosing between these alternative analy- ses before our society selects policies regarding population growth, en- ergy use, and economic development. Wishing to meet Spengler on his own terms, we agree to explore the long-run limits to growth, but we feel that the long run must be identified as some span relevant to current decision making. A period so distant that it has no bearing on current choices, such as the extinction of the sun, will not be considered germane to the discussion. We think it reasonable to say that the long run includes the next 500 years or less. Do Finite Nonhuman Resources Limit Growth? The question of whether finite nonhuman resources limit growth has two parts: Are resources finite, and if so, must they limit growth? In his contribution to Science and Ceremony, Spengler does not directly answer the first, although he does write of "the nonaugmentability of the stock of some biospheric elements."3 However, in other places he clearly states that resources are finite and that they limit growth. In 1974, he asserted</page><page sequence="3">The Limits to Growth 657 that the physical environment is finite and has a finite load-bearing ca- pacity,4 while earlier he claimed there are limitational factors, some of which are food, energy, raw materials, and water. "They become limita- tional factors because their ultimate sources of supply are fixed in quan- tity or subject to depletion."5 These ultimate sources of supply are prob- ably the same absolute barriers to growth about which Spengler has written. Thus, we do not doubt that Spengler would accept the proposition that finite nonhuman resources limit growth. Spengler seems to have three prime sources for his position. The first is Malthus, who "stressed the limitedness of the supply of accessible arable land."7 Malthus argued that since there is a finite amount of land available for food production, there must be a finite quantity of food that can be grown on it and, consequently, a limit to the growth of population. Spengler finds that analysis of 1798 persuasive today, although we note that he uses it to predict rather than to state a fact: "It is quite likely, how- ever, that limitation of food due to limitation of land will become the limitational factor in parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Elsewhere land in the sense of living space is likely to become the limitational factor. Thus Malthus will have been proven right in stressing the role of limita- tional factor, above all agricultural land."8 Second, Spengler refers favorably to Jevons, who "presented Western man with a more difficult problem than had Malthus: the need to find alternative sources of energy."9 Jevons felt that coal had replaced corn or land as the primary limitational factor, and he argued that there was almost no hope of replacing it as the major industrial energy source: "All things considered, it is not reasonable to suppose or expect that the power of coal will ever be superseded by anything better. It is the naturally best source of power, as air and water and gold and iron are, each for its own purposes, the most useful of substances and such as will never be super- seded."'0 Jevons's specific prediction was that coal would become an ab- solute limitational factor for Great Britain's industrial economy within a century of the time he wrote, but his general proposition may be stated as follows: Resources are finite; some resources are depleted with use; substitutes for key depleted resources are not likely to be found; conse- quently, industrial economies must cease growing. We think that Spengler would accept this proposition. Third, Spengler refers frequently to Georgescu-Roegen and the eco- nomic implications of the physical law of entropy. Georgescu-Roegen states explicitly that resources in the form of low entropy are finite and shrinking: "History proves . .. first, that in a finite space there can be only a finite amount of low entropy and, second, that low entropy con-</page><page sequence="4">658 Baldwin Ranson tinuously and irrevocably dwindles away."'" The sources of low entropy (available resources) are free energy from the sun (a flow), free energy stored in the earth (a stock), and ordered material structures stored in the earth (a stock). 2 Each of these is naturally approaching thermody- namic equilibrium by a progressive diffusion of its available heat, but the most immediate limit to human growth seems to be in the scarcity of terrestrial stored energy. "The general picture is now clear. The terrestrial energies on which we can rely effectively [fossil fuels] exist in very small amounts, whereas the use of those which exist in ampler amounts [nuclear fuels] is surrounded by great risks and formidable technical obstacles.'3 Georgescu-Roegen suggests that these fuel stocks could be depleted within a few decades, but apparently he does not see this as an absolute barrier to growth. His argument is more general: Since the law of entropy shows that we are bound to run out of available resources eventually, and since every use of resources reduces the available stock, we should immediately reduce production and consumption activities so as to delay the day of total chaos.'4 Although Spengler uses other sources and data, his theoretical position is apparently an amalgam of those of Malthus, Jevons, and Georgescu- Roegen. With Malthus he would agree that arable land is finite, as is the amount of food that can be grown on it and that the limit to land must limit population growth. With Jevons he would agree that mineral re- sources are finite and depleting, that substitutes are not likely to be found, and that the limit to resources must limit the production of industrial economies. With Georgescu-Roegen he would agree that low entropy is finite and dissipating, and thus human life must be finite in quantity and duration. The amalgam of these views might be stated thus: The physical existence of resources determines what is available to man, the finiteness of which limits man's potential growth. Is it reasonable to dissent from the proposition that man is limited by finite biospheric resources? Is there any warrant for denying these limits external to man and for finding others within the species? Spengler's assertion that Ayres ignored the finiteness of nonhuman re- sources is true only in the trivial sense that Ayres wrote little about it. Ayres's reason was not ignorance of the arguments for scarcity but rejec- tion of them. Spengler himself quotes Ayres's position on resources,'5 but apparently he saw no need to analyze or rebut it since he follows these quotations with his conclusion that Ayres simply did not know what was going on. Ayres's basic position is that resources are always and necessarily de-</page><page sequence="5">The Limits to Growth 659 termined by a society's stock of know-how. Any component of the non- human environment that a group learns to use becomes a resource as a result of that learning, not as a result of the component's physical prop- erties. As know-how increases, so do the components specified as re- sources. Thus nonhuman resources are not finite, and it is highly unlikely they will limit growth. Ayres did not invent this notion of resources growing without limit. An early proponent was Henry Charles Carey, who used the idea to refute the scarcity notions of Malthus and David Ricardo. In Principles of Po- litical Economy, published in 1837, Carey traced the increasing returns that man had experienced with technological advance, in contrast to the decreasing returns expected by classical economists. We possess no means of measuring the extent of the powers of the earth. It produces now vastly more than it did half a century since, and the close of the present century will see it rendered greatly more productive than at present. When we cast our eyes over the surface of the globe, and see how large is the portion that is yet totally unoccupied-how large a portion of that which appears to be occupied is really so, only to the extent that its powers can be reached with the worst machinery, . . . and that there is a great extension of production as science is brought to the aid of the agri- culturist, we cannot hesitate to admit that the productive power of land exists in measureless quantity.16 Carey saw the earth's potential as measureless because its exploitation (availability) depends on expanding know-how. In particular, he re- jected the idea that the finiteness of land area dictates that a finite quantity of food can be grown. Up to his time (and since), the opposite had been true. "With increased control over the natural forces, [man] is thus en- abled to obtain a constant increase of food from any given surface, with steady increase in the power to live in connection with his fellow man. Association grows, giving in its turn power to bring into activity other forces that thus far have remained dormant and waiting the help of man. "17 Carey asserted that Malthus was incorrect in finding limits to growth in the nonhuman environment. Surprisingly, Spengler makes almost the same point on the page quoted above where he predicts that Malthus will be proven correct. While claiming that the absolute limit to agricultural output-assumed to be the photosynthetic efficiency of plants-is being reached in some regions, Spengler maintains that the effective limits to growth lie in the limited know-how of people in other regions. Food</page><page sequence="6">660 Baldwin Ranson shortages are expected because of limits within man, which is precisely Ayres's position. "In sum, while it is possible to demonstrate that Malthus' expectation was not well founded, it will not be easy to do so. The road to affluence remains hard. Unless the wings of the stork are clipped in the short Indian summer that lies ahead, at least one of the four horsemen, Hunger, will ride within the lifetime of our children."18 We do not claim that increasing agricultural output will be easy, but we know of no evidence that it will reach some absolute limit within 500 years. We assert that if producing adequate amounts of food is technically possible without identifiable limit, then Malthus's thesis that finite land dictates finite food production falls to the ground. As Spengler says, Jevons presents a more difficult problem than does Malthus. Even if technological advance makes a resource more produc- tive, we will still be limited if its quantity diminishes with use. The response is that substitution of one resource for another has occurred historically and is likely to continue. One of the best arguments along this line is made by Erich Zimmermann. His basic premise is that resources do not exist as physical facts, but only as the result of human appraisal. Something is a resource only insofar as it can be related to human wants and abilities, only as man knows how to use it and wants to use it in productive pro- cesses. "To be considered for its resources, the environment must be brought into relationship to man. Hence, the resource concept is relative. This relativity is twofold, for the resource aspects of the environment vary not only according to human wants, but also according to the abilities of man to make use of his environment and to shape it to fit his designs."19 From Zimmermann's perspective, nonhuman resources are not finite. Although he might have granted Jevons's contention that the physical amount of coal is finite,20 he would not have leaped to the conclusion that the amount of energy available to man is finite and must limit industrial output. He recognized that coal could be superseded by better energy sources. "A civilization based on a fund of exhaustible resources cannot be permanent; it is necessarily a passing phenomenon in human history. A civilization based on a flow of renewable resources may be permanent. But fortunately inanimate energy can be derived not only from the fund of stored-up solar energy, but also from the flow of current solar energy."21 Again quoting Spengler, one may ask whether he is inconsistent, or is arbitrarily limiting the possibilities of technological advance and resource substitution to the "short run." "Continuation and augmentation of cur- rent use of depletable resources will exhaust current reserves of most of these in not many decades. It is quite possible, however, that fusion and</page><page sequence="7">The Limits to Growth 661 fission, assisted by breeder reactors, can provide inexhaustible energy sources, and that these in turn may make available substitutes for all or most scarce resources."22 We do not pretend to guarantee that a substitute will always be found for each particular vital resource, but we see no evidence whatsoever war- ranting acceptance of Jevons's proposition that we are guaranteed to fail. To base social policy on the assumption that resource substitution will not occur is to ignore the historical evidence. Georgescu-Roegen cannot be answered as easily as can Malthus and Jevons. He maintains that the applicability of the entropy law to the eco- nomic process is irrevocable, and that increasing efficiency of resource use or substitution of one resource for another does not touch this basic fact. "Whatever resources or arable land we may need at one time or an- other, they will consist of accessible low entropy and accessible land. And since all kinds together are in finite amount, no taxonomic switch can do away with that finiteness."23 This assertion is at the heart of the intellectual disagreement under analysis. Those of Spengler's persuasion assert that biospheric limits to growth-be they arable land, available energy, waste-absorption capacity, or the photosynthetic capacity of plants-are facts of life in the nonhuman environment; those of Ayres's persuasion assert that biospheric limits are a function of human know-how. At issue is not taxonomic switching, but the status of the categories "limit" and "resource." Do these terms refer to environmental conditions or to human thought? Georgescu-Roegen admits that the law of the inexorable dispersion of low entropy is patently anthropomorphic, but he also maintains that it fits the physical facts. Consequently, he appears to define "low entropy" in both a conceptual and a physical sense. He equates low entropy with use- ful energy as seen from the human perspective, but he also sees it as a finite stock of energy that is available in some absolute, physical sense.24 From Ayres's point of view, "limit," "resource," and "low entropy" would be concepts that serve as instruments of thought. The logic of this position was extensively developed by John Dewey,25 but not in terms of limited resources. For analysis we turn to Edgar Dunn and also suggest that readers consult Gerald Feinberg, Kenneth Boulding, Marshall Sahlins and others, and R. Buckminster Fuller.26 In 1971, Dunn published a profound study of the processes of social change and economic development. He examined the standard growth models and found them all to be closed machine systems. This label would appear to apply to the thermodynamic model, despite the fact that</page><page sequence="8">662 Baldwin Ranson Georgescu-Roegen asserts that it is dialectically open. Dunn finds such models to be inappropriately confining, and in their place he develops a learning system model in which limits are constantly redefined as learning proceeds. "Set over against this concept of the machine system is the con- cept of the learning system. A learning system contrasts with a machine system because it has the capacity (a) to be reprogrammed in its behavior, or (b) to reprogram itself through the action of internal sources of new behavioral ideas, transformation motives, and transformation be- havior."27 Rather than call this approach taxonomic switching, we would refer to it as the principle of emergence of novelty by combination. This is a label that Georgescu-Roegen gives to limitations on what can be known de- ductively,28 but we find it appropriate for the potential of Dunn's learn- ing system to increase resource availability without limit through repro- gramming. "As cybernetic-oriented investigation has evolved, the scholars concerned with these issues have refused to stop at this dividing line be- tween systems that can and those that cannot negotiate a paradigm shift. A few hardy souls are pushing beyond into the domain of systems open to both information and entropy transfer and capable of acting as true learning systems."29 Dunn explicitly relates his learning system model to the concept of re- sources, showing that resources only exist in relation to concrete be- havioral modes. So we see that evolution has progressively redefined the material, energy and, ultimately, idea resources that serve as available means for biological and cultural organisms as it has transformed their organization and modes of behavior. The resource concept is seen as a relative concept. Whether an attribute of nature is actively or potentially assimilated by living organ- isms or social systems depends upon the requirements of its evolved be- havioral mode. An attribute of nature that is relevant to behavioral system requirements, but beyond its effective behavioral range, is not a resource under this definition. Both changes in the ends to be served and changes in accessibility or availability bring about changes in the content of the re- source concept.30 From these excerpts, it should be evident that Dunn would join Ayres in rejecting the assertion that finite nonhuman resources limit growth. We believe we have established the existence of a coherent and substantial alternative to the position that limits to growth lie outside man. We lay no claim to having proven that human life will continue eternally, but we feel we have raised serious issues for anyone who would claim that some biospheric limit must end mankind's growth within the next 500 years.</page><page sequence="9">The Limits to Growth 663 We turn now to the related issue of how humans should use their resources in light of how those uses affect resource availability. Do Man's Activities Reduce Nonhuman Resources? Discussions of limits to growth have generally focused on whether or not scarcity in the supply of resources must constrain human growth. Rarely is the possibility of increasing the supply of resources through using them considered. Much of Spengler's professional life has been devoted to the study of population economics. In general, he seems to find that the more people living at any time, the fewer people will be able to live in the future because large populations reduce resource supplies more quickly than do small ones. We believe he would maintain that man's activities do reduce the availability of nonhuman resources. He sees life as a contest for decreas- ingly available matter and energy. "Man may be said to draw upon his environment for the matter and energy that sustain him, only to degrade both, some so completely as to render them forever useless to other men. Life may therefore be viewed as a contest for available matter and energy, a contest that tends to become more intense as increases in man's numbers and consuming power threaten to reduce their availability."'31 Despite his conclusion that resource availability is reduced by man's behavior, Spengler does recognize that some of that behavior can lead in the opposite direction. Man's activities affect the substance of E, his inorganic environment, in two ways. On the one hand, through changes in his technology and tastes he has been able to draw an increasing fraction of the potentials of his environment into use. Increase in U, the fraction of E at man's disposal, reflects increase in the importance of man's environment. At the same time man uses up potential in his environment by changing its composition from a useful to a useless form, as when he exhausts supplies of fossil fuels. Man's activities may then be said to produce economic entropy, which is change from a more to a less useful state.32 Ayres, we believe, would have said that man's activities need not re- duce nonhuman resources. Although he would have agreed with Spengler that some human activities might decrease resource availability while others increase it, he would have made the distinction differently. Ayres consistently applied the Veblenian dichotomy between instru- mental and ceremonial behavior, but not to behavior apart from conse-</page><page sequence="10">664 Baldwin Ranson quences. He referred to activities as instrumental if they expanded human life potential, as ceremonial if they constricted that potential. To determine in which category Ayres would place exhaustion of fossil fuel, for example, requires inquiry; it is not self-evident from his work. Let us examine a graphic statement by Georgescu-Roegen and con- sider how we might respond from Spengler's and Ayres's point of view. "The conclusion is straightforward. If we stampede over details, we can say that every baby born now means one human life less in the future. But also every Cadillac produced at any time means fewer lives in the future."33 We think Spengler would maintain that both a baby and a Cadillac con- sume resources which, once consumed, are generally not available for other uses. The production process has reduced the inventory of avail- able resources. Ayres would have agreed that a baby and a Cadillac con- sume resources, but these two uses can be expected to have very different consequences. If the Cadillac is an example of inefficient transportation, we may say that a large quantity of resources has been employed that re- duces current resource inventories while providing very little service- ability. On the other hand, consumption by the baby, while it also reduces current resource inventories, is the one use to which those resources can be put that has the potential of increasing future resource inventories. If the baby should grow up and add to the stock of human know-how, it may increase resource inventories many times over what they were at its birth. Consequently, Ayres would have denied that man's activities necessarily reduce the availability of nonhuman resources. If the use to which a re- source is put is instrumental rather than ceremonial, it will have the con- sequence of expanding human life potential by increasing human ability to do things. Thus we think Ayres might not have objected to our exhaust- ing supplies of fossil fuels if they are used instrumentally, because making one resource less available is necessary if we are to make other resources more available. Two similes may be used to summarize the different consequences of man's activities that Spengler and Ayres foresee. Spengler's view might be likened to eating popcorn; every mouthful we eat must leave one less mouthful in the future. By contrast, Ayres seems to feel that using re- sources may be like composing music. We may use any number of notes we wish in our composition without in the slightest reducing the avail- ability of notes to other composers. "The creation of new patterns does not mean that the old ones have been lost, but rather that a new dimension, which extends the possibilities of the old ones, has been added."34 Returning to Science and Ceremony, there Spengler correctly asserts that Ayres found the limits to growth within man, not only within his in-</page><page sequence="11">The Limits to Growth 665 stitutions-those prescribed patterns of correlated behavior that may pre- vent change-but also within his limited know-how. This is a coherent and substantially different alternative to an analysis which finds that the limits to growth lie in the biosphere, outside of man. Is this intellectual disagreement merely academic? Three Policy Issues Americans tend to assume that their social problems come to them al- ready defined by the physical facts. Such has been the case in identifying problems of population, energy, and development. In each case it has been assumed that the problem results from mankind trying to exceed the limits to growth imposed by the natural environment; humans have been found guilty of ignoring scarcity, which is the first chapter of wisdom in the book of economics. We are trying to expand population more quickly than food production can be expanded. We are consuming fuels more quickly than substitutes can be perfected. We are trying to make poor countries rich when there are not enough resources for all to be rich. Given these definitions of three problems, our policy choices appear clear. To deal with the population explosion, we should take vigorous action to achieve zero population growth. To resolve the energy crisis, we should reduce fuel consumption levels. As for the development prob- lem, we should forthrightly tell the poor that it is impossible for them to be as rich as we are. With such problem definitions and policy prescriptions, economics is once again proclaiming itself as the dismal science. But if we realize that problems and policies are human conceptualizations rather than state- ments of fact, there might be a way out. The alternative is found in the analysis of Clarence Ayres. From an Ayresian perspective, the population problem has not arisen because the physical carrying capacity of the earth has been exceeded, but because many humans are not given access to the physical and in- tellectual resources that exist. Policy choices might include steps to re- duce population growth, but equally important would be the removal of those institutional obstacles to production and distribution that prevent so many humans from developing their potential for expanding know-how. The energy crisis is not the result of using energy too rapidly, but of the wastefulness of many of the uses. Policy choices might include energy conservation, but more important would be educating people to the Veb- lenian distinction between wasteful and serviceable uses of energy. De- voting more energy to serviceable activities is the only way in which we</page><page sequence="12">666 Baldwin Ranson can increase the energy available to man. Finally, it is not the niggardliness of nature that makes some nations poor, but imperfect human institutions that interfere with the diffusion and application of the know-how that could make all people productive. Policy choices must include perfecting the theory of institutional adjust- ment and the theory of education for development. When all peoples possess this know-how, they will be able to solve their own development problems. Spengler and Ayres are strong expositors of two alternative systems of thought. The academic community has the responsibility for resolving this intellectual disagreement so that society may correctly define its prob- lems and devise wise policies to solve them. Science and Ceremony has raised the issue. We must pursue it by pushing back the limits to growth and understanding that lie within man's patterned behavior. Notes 1.
