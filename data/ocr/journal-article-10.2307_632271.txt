<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF BOOKS This concentration on theory also underlies G.'s decision to press the argument that his Greek models represent thinking about '(what we call) personality', and specifically that Greek accounts of what it is to be human can be compared to modem theories of person- hood. G. deals in detail with criticisms which could be made of this project, as well as with criticisms which have actually been made of his earlier work on the same topic, but I remain unconvinced that he has met the fundamental objection that there is no one concept of the person, but rather a range of conceptions founded on varying sets of criteria which are more or less arbitrary and, when translated into the real world, often repug- nant. (Are sufferers from Alzheimer's disease persons? Not on the typical criteria). Theories of personhood, moreover, often have a moral agenda. To be a person is to enjoy certain rights to be treated in certain ways and not in others; this is different from most ancient concep- tions of what it is to be a human being. Only the Stoics advance very far along the path of making the human being as such a locus of ethical value, while in popular contexts one's claims normally rest on participation in some definite relationship or particular community. The participant framework on which G. lays such emphasis, in fact, does not favour the development of an interest in concepts such as that of the 'person'. G.'s work constitutes a powerful argument in favour of a historically aware dialectic between modem and ancient ideas. It will be most rewarding to those pre- pared to work hard-to test its hypotheses, follow up references, pursue the controversies in which it engages, and use its insights in other applications. This is a book with which one can do a great deal, both in applying and in modifying its thesis. DOUGLAS L. CAIRNS University of Leeds SONNTAGBAUER (W.) Das Eigentlicher is unaussprech- bar. Der Kanon des Polyklet als 'mathematische' Form. (Europaische Hochschulschriften Reihe XV Bd. 69). Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang, 1995. Pp. 322. ?36/DM 89. 3631489250. The ancient report that the fifth century Argive sculptor, Polyclitus, wrote a book, the Canon, setting out a series of mathematical relationships which would define the perfect proportions for the human body and that this was incorporated in one of his bronzes, the Doryphorus, and the identification (since the middle of the nineteenth century) of this statue with one of a boy of which over fifty copies survive (the best-known being the one from Pompeii which is to be found in the Archaeological Museum at Naples) opens up the intrigu- ing possibility that careful measurement of these copies might reveal the principles of the system. The sub-title of Sonntagbauer's book suggests that it might be another of the regular attempts (none of which has yet been convincing) to do just that. So it is, in a sense, but its aims are actually much broader. S. conveniently lists for the reader no fewer than twenty propositions which he will aim to prove (25-7). Those specific to Polyclitus' statue are: that the mathematical system on which it is based is founded on contemporary mathematics and music theory; that the proportions are not static, but dynamic; that they involve concepts of time and space; that irrational numbers must in some sense be involved; that mathematical irrationality and proportion are linked. More general propositions are: that fifth century thought is essentially 'musical-mathematical' in nature; that musical theory, mathematics, and philosophy are all tied together; that this kind of musical-mathematical world- view is not physical as we would understand the term, but anthropomorphic; that fifth century thought is Pythagorean; that Heraclitus is involved in this as well; that most philosophical terms are also 'musical-mathe- matical' terms; that the question of incommensurability is central to fifth century thought; that tragedy also has its roots in these ideas. Even in the abbreviated and sim- plified (and no doubt over-simplified) form in which I have stated these objectives (and I have, in the interests of brevity, omitted several which could not be satisfac- torily summarised) this is a formidable programme, and it is hardly worth saying that S. fails to prove all of these points; this is a plan for a lifetime's scholarly work, rather than a single book. There are a number of issues which one would expect to see discussed in an argument based on Polyclitus' Canon. How far can one rely on the accuracy of a copy, for example? And can (e.g.) Galen's rhetorically vague flourishes ('the relation- ship of finger to finger, and of all of them to the palm and the wrist, and of them to the forearm, and of the forearm to the arm, and of everything to everything ...') be treated as if they were mathematically precise formulations of proportion. S. does not consider these questions. He makes big assumptions. It is taken for granted that 'mathematical' equals 'Pythagorean' (although, despite a lot of generalised talk about Pythagorean mathematics, ancient sources actually attribute an extraordinarily small number of real math- ematical advances to Pythagoreans). Though it is still legitimate to present the discovery of the irrationality of the square root of 2 as an important turning point in the history of mathematics, it would have been good to see some recognition of the doubts recently expressed that it was really the 'foundational crisis' we used to believe. The principal problem, however, is S.'s failure to demonstrate, in an argument which claims to find Pythagoreanism and mathematics behind an enormous variety of aspects of Greek culture, that in fifth century Greece philosophy and mathematics were of interest to any but a handful of eccentrics (and his attempt to turn virtually all contemporary philosophers into crypto- Pythagoreans is not convincing). The virtue of S.'s book is in the detail, and in the hard, precise argumentation. Had the thesis been less ambitious, it would have had more to say. Finally, there is an extensive bibliography including 218 items. Only ten of them are not in Ger- man (and of these ten, nine are in English). Although, I suppose, one could take a wry pleasure in noting that it is not only Anglophones who can be remorselessly monoglot, it is sad that this should be the case with a book which bears the symbol of the European Union prominently on its cover. More important, the result is that the base of scholarly activity on which the book rests is insufficiently broad to support a thesis so wide- ranging and potentially so important.
