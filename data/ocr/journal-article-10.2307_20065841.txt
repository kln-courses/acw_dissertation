<plain_text><page sequence="1">25. The dove chronicles: whistling wings. H. E. McClure. 1991. Boxwood Press, Pacific Grove, California. 99 pp. $9.95, softcover.?This book is a popular tale written somewhat in the genre of Thornton W. Burgess of "Adventures of Prickly Porky" and the "Old Mother West Wind" stories of a couple generations ago?but with a much more factual thread to the story. McClure follows the lives and adventures of "Zee" and "Naida," a pair of Mourning Doves (Zenaida macroura), and their friends (most with Indian names meaning "dove" or somesuch). Although extremely anthropomorphic, this book will appeal to some audiences and it does accurately portray the species' natural history and the travails that Mourning Doves must face: flimsy nests that are easily blown down, disease, and hunters. Ah yes, hunters. Militant hunters will no doubt take exception to this book?and no doubt militant anti-hunters will embrace it. The story is emotionally charged. One of the characters, "Stump Face," survived having his beak blown away. Perhaps the emotion is justified. I've never understood the rationale for southern dove hunts in early September at a time when many southern doves still have eggs or young in the nest. McClure questions "Is this wildlife management?" Although not a scientific treatise, this should be on the "must read" list of dove biologists and students in wildlife management or wildlife man agement ethics courses. It's provocative.?Jerome A.
