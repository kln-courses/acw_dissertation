<plain_text><page sequence="1">IX.-NEW BOOKS ll Pensiero di Bertrand Russell. By EMMANUELE RIVERSO. Istituto Editoriale del Mezzogiorno, 1958. Pp. 568. Lire 4000. DURING the Fascist era the only works of Lord Russell available in Italian were On Education and The Scientific Outlook. Since the war, however, The Principles of Mathematics, Introduction to MUathematical Philosophy, The Analysis of Mind and Human Knowledge have all been translated into Italian; as have several of Russell's political writings and his History of Western Philosophy. In 1953 an entire issue of the Rivista Critica di Storia della Filosofia was devoted to Russell. Now Sig. Riverso has produced a full length study in Italian of every aspect of his philosophy. The ample scope of this handsome volume is best indicated by an account of its structure. The first chapter, after an initial account of Russell's early work on the foundations of geometry and the philosophy of Leibniz, is mainly devoted to a synopsis of The Principles of Mathematics; but it introduces this with a short treatment of the work of Peano and Frege. The second chapter, 120 pages long, is entitled " The Logic of Principia Mathematica "; but in addition to a somewhat breathless summary of the system of Principia it contains sections on the polemic against Poincare in the 1900s, on Whitehead's " Universal Algebra ", on the development of the theory of descriptions, on the controversy with Bradley over relations, and on the discussions of implication and the theory of types which preceded 1910. It concludes with an account of later developments due to Sheffer, Wittgenstein and others, and a discussion of the new matter inserted in the second edition of Principia. The chapter on Russell's philosophy of mind places The Problems of Philosophy and The Analysis of Mind in their context with sections on post-Cartesian dualism, behaviour- ism, and James' " pluralistic universe "; it contains also an account of Russell's epistemology from Our Knowledge of the External World up to Human Knowledge, devoting a special section to the treatment of proba- bility in the latter work. The succeeding chapter, on the philosophy of nature, expounds Russell's views on causality and laws of nature, on space, time and events, and on the philosophy of science, interspersing lengthy discussions of Einstein, Whitehead and Bergson. Russell's relation to the Vienna Circle is- discussed in the chapter on " Problems of Language " which is based largely on An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth. The book concludes with chapters on Russell's humanism, on his political and socio- logical views, and on his personality and influence over others. There is hardly a chapter which Russell has written which does not find a place, briskly summarised, somewhere in the book. The documentation is conscientious throughout; even Russell's letters to The Times are laid under contribution. Sig. Riverso's industry has not confined itself to Russell's own writings; on almost every page detailed footnotes refer the reader to the subsequent literature on Russellian topics. The author displays an astonishingly wide acquaintance with every branch of twentieth-century Anglo-American philosophy. If he appears more at home with contemporary American trends than with current British interests or with Wittgenstein's laterwork, that is not, perhaps, inappropriate to his subject. Unfortunately, it may be questioned whether Sig. Riverso is always as accurate as he is thorough. lIe is aware of the importance of the theory of descriptions: he endorses Ramsey's eulogy of it as a paradigm of philo- sophy, and quotes with approval Alan Wood's remark that it is Russell's 270</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS 271 most important single contribution to the subject. It might have been expected, therefore, that he wouLd take particular pains to get it right. In fact his account of the theory (pp. 117-126) would seriously mislead anyone coming to it for the first time. The definition in Principia f{(l'x) (ox)} = :(3 c) : O _x . x = c : fc Df. is rendered into words as la frase "I 'x che soddisfa Ox, soddisfa fx" si definisce: "c'e un c tale che 'Ox' e sempre equivalente a x e un c' e inoltre vale fc ". In other words, ' x = c ' is read as 'x is a c ', thus making nonsense of the whole theory. No doubt this is just a particularly unfortunate misprint; but other mistakes cannot be so explained. A description, says Sig. Riverso, is a " denomination of an individual carried out with the aid of the definite article ". But it is a major part of Russell's theory that a descrip- tion such as 'the present King of France ' does not denote, or name, anything, neither an individual, nor a non-subsistent entity, nor the null class; while some descriptions which do denote, such as 'the revolution of the earth about the sun' do not denote any individual. Sig. Riverso says that the philosophical importance of the theory is that it shows that "the notion of an individual is composed of two elements: logical exist- ence plus self-identity ". Whatever this may mean, the theory of descrip- tions, in itself, says nothing about the notion of an individual. " It is not necessary" says Russell " for a description that it should describe an individual; it may describe a predicate or a relation or anything else." (Logic and Knowledge, p. 243.) Sig. Riverso devotes most of his account of On Denoting to a discussion of Russell's arguments against Frege's theory of denoting. These argu- ments are admittedly confused; but Sig. Riverso further confounds this confusion. In On Denoting Russell renders ' Sinn ' by ' meaning ' and 'Bedeutung' by 'denotation'. Riverso renders 'Sinn' by 'senso', but 'meaning' by 'significato'; he uses 'significato' for 'Bedeutung' while using ' denotazione ' for ' denotation '. It is not therefore surprising that his account does justice neither to Frege nor to Russell. For example, he does not make clear to his reader that when Russell denies that a denot- ing phrase has any meaning in itself, he is not asserting that it is unintel- ligible or nonsensical, but rather denying that it expresses a Fregean Sinn or denoting complex. (Logic and Knowledge, pp. 46, 48-51.) Perhaps he does not realise this himself, for he remarks that the denial of meaning to individual expressions is " a high price to pay " for the clarity gained by Russell's theory. Finally, Sig. Riverso alleges that the difference between the theory given in On Denoting and that presented in Principia is that in the earlier work proper names are regarded as abbreviated descriptions, whereas in the later one they are regarded as having a designation even in isolation. In fact there is no suggestion in On Denoting that proper names, other than fictional ones, are abbreviated descriptions. Russell did indeed change his mind about names such as 'Socrates', but the change of mind was in the opposite direction. In 1903 he was happy to call Socrates an individual and ' Socrates ' a proper name; in 1918 he says that ' Socrates ' is an abbreviated description, and what it describes is not a particular but a system of classes. (The Principles of Mathematics, 19; Logic and Knowledge, 201.) These remarks show that Sig. Riverso is not always to be trusted as an exponent of Russell's views. As a critic of them he is sometimes acute and sometimes exasperating. For instance, on pages 231-233 he has some sound</page><page sequence="3">272 NEW BOOKS remarks about the difficulties which attend alike Russell's notion of acquain- tance, and the post-Cartesian notion of consciousness. But in the very same chapter he says that Russell is entirely right in thinking that epis- temology must begin with the introspective observation of one's own knowledge (p. 263). Clearly, he is himself a victim of the erroneous picture which the notions he criticises embody. The verbose and abstract style of the text contrasts quaintly with the concrete concision of the writings which it concerns. We constantly meet sentences such as the following: "In opposition to the monistic confusion defended by absolute idealism, [Russell] set up the organic unity of multi- plicity, loyally recognizing both the plurality of terms in their undeniable authenticity, and the linking-up of these terms by a system of real relations of objective metaphysical import " (p. 132). An English reader of this book cannot fail to be fascinated by the surprising appearance presented by familiar philosophical ideas rendered into alien idiom. Nor, I fear, can he fail to be disquieted by a lingering suspicion that some of them have been distorted in the process. ANTHONY KENNY F. H. Bradley. By RICHARD WOLLHEIM. London: Penguin Books (Pelican Philosophy Series), 1959. Pp. 288. 5s. THE student of philosophy in this country today rarely studies the nine- teenth-century idealists for their own sake. They are commonly presented as philosophers with very odd views indeed whose chief role in the history of the subject was to provoke Moore and Russell into those reactions from which we date the real history of modern philosophy. We may guess that Bradley at least deserves more attention than he has been given of late, for it is scarcely plausible that a man who wrote so well should be philo- sophically altogether negligible. A splendid essay on Bradley by Mr. Wollheim in The Revolution in Philosophy encouraged us to hope for a more extended study; and this he has now produced. Wollheim has chosen to approach Bradley not as the great systematizer but as the author of the Principles of Logic who (as Wollheim points out), at exactly the same time as Frege, destroyed psychologism in logic and thus made it certain that a revived empiricism would attempt to construct a logical rather than a psychological foundation for its doctrines. In the first chapter he discusses in detail Bradley's criticism of empiricism; in the next two chapters he discusses at great length Bradley's arguments against Pluralism; then follows a chapter on ' Thought and Truth ', in which Bradley's characteristic doctrines on Immediate Experience, the Self, Negation, Contradiction and Contrariety, Inference, Identity and Truth are examined with care. He concludes with two relatively short chapters on Appearance and Reality, and Morality and God; and a brief Epilogue. hI the epilogue he suggests that there is an analogy, and perhaps more than an analogy, between ' the metaphysical attachment to the idea of an undivided Reality and the desire to establish " whole objects " which is of such crucial importance in infantile development'. This excursion into the psychoanalytical exegesis of philosophical doctrines seems a little dis- cordant with the rigorously philosophical tone of the rest of the book and</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS 273 ought perhaps either to have been omitted or to have been developed at greater length. As it stands it is merely smart and not very illuminating. Taken as a whole, the book is a brilliant performance. It is a measure of Wollheim's achievement that one can think of no other contemporary philosopher who could have produced quite so unfaltering a performance on this subject. It is very well written, flawed only by a touch of the precious here and there (this tendency towards the precious betrays him at times into expressions that are scarcely correct, as, for instance, when he writes: ' here he parts companyfrom common sense ' (p. 48), or : ' The exact connection between this conclusion and the discussion that precedes it, is, it must be admitted, far from lucid' (p. 63)-reviewer's italics in both cases). It is a great merit of Wollheim's critical discussion of Bradley's character- istic doctrines that trumps are rarely led at the beginning of the game. It would have been easy, and entertaining, to have dealt with Bradley in the manner of the early Moore or the later Wittgenstein, showing that on, for instance, relations or the concept of appearance what Bradley had to say swings between the outrageously obscure and the patently senseless. Wollheim's approach is quite different. He takes Bradley's arguments as they stand and without forcing a premature quarrel with his principles and characteristic ways of setting out problems is able to expose the dif- ficulties and obscurities of the arguments by an appeal to principles and by the use of modes of argument that Bradley himself would have recognized as having force. Wollheim is able to do this because he does in general recognize the sharpness of Bradley's logical insights and sees him, not as the exponent of a constructive metaphysics, but as the first-rate critical mind who restored logic, unobscured by psychologism, to its proper role in philosophy. This is fame enough for any philosopher. That Bradley should have been notable in his time and even later for his dark metaphysi- cal views is to be explained by his historical situation. It was generally supposed that it was the business of philosophy to fill the empty place left by the decline, among the educated classes, of orthodox religion. There is indeed no reason to suppose that Bradley himself altogether dissented from this view, though when he came across Matthew Arnold's home-made belief in 'the Eternal, not ourselves, that makes for righteousness ', itself a low-grade metaphysical belief not too far removed from Bradley's own sentiments in the matter, his rage could not be restrained and he gave us those memorable pages of Ethical Studies that can be compared, in terms of savage power, only with the Swift of A Modest Proposal or the Newman who dissected Kingsley. Wollheim early makes a rough division between those metaphysicians who conceive their task as being to correct the concepts and modes of thought we have and those who wish to clarify rather than correct. 'To the first category belong Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, and Russell: to the second, Aristotle, Berkeley, Kant, and the later Wittgenstein ' (p. 67). When in the end he tries to place Bradley in relation to this division he finds that in a way he belongs to both, and to neither. At one level he does indeed think that our ordinary beliefs, and those systematic disciplines such as history and the natural sciences founded on them, are all right as they are. Indeed, it is precisely this that, set against the doctrine that all relations are internal, that no judgments are unambiguously true and that there is appearance and reality, Moore found intensely puzzling. At another level, he sees all our thought, including that kind of thinking which tries to correct our thought, as so radically infected with error that what is</page><page sequence="5">274 NEW BOOKS wrong cannot be stated, for tte same error infects our corrections of the error. It lo.lov s tLen (Wolill eim argues) that Brad ey is reduced to trying to induce a vision of the world, for the attempt to give a critical and corrective account of our ordinary concepts in the light of surerior concepts is seif-defeating. This vision can be communicated only indirectly and is to be understood by analogy with that kind of aesthetic experience which is ineffable and only to be described with the use of such almost vacuous conceFts as 'significant form'. This would be a melancholy conclusion if tLe real greatness of Bradley was thLought to lie here; but we have seen reason to think that his philosophically important achievement is quite otLer than this. A brief account Wollieim gives of the history of logic (pp. 71, 72) is seriously misleading, in that it fails to take into account what is now known about Stoic and medieval logic and unduly simplifies the position of Aris- totle. It is true, this is the account of the history of logic Bradley presupposes, but it is undesirable now to give currency to this historical fiction. Woliheim refers to the pattern of argument to be found in Aristotle's argument in the Physics for a First Cause, in Aquinas's Second Way and in the Thesis of the third of Kant's antinomies of Pure Reason and adds that 'in traditional hands the argument is used in a fideist interest ' (p. 96-reviewer's italics). This is a wrong use of ' fideist '. Indeed, it would on the contrary be correct to say that in traditional hands the argument is used against fideism. It is confusing rather than illumi- nating to write: 'From the time of Athens onwards, philosophers have been much occupied with the problem of Substance or Matter, a very general notion arrived at by one or other of various processes of abstrac- tion from the ordinary idea of an object or thing ' (p. 193). Historically -whatever may be true of the modern vernacular-' substance ' and ' matter' are by no means the same concept; and 'processes of abstrac- tion', while it may make sense in connection with Locke, scarcely does justice to Aristotle. For 'somewhat' (line 25, p. 152) we should, I take it, read 'sometimes'. J. M. CAMERON Truth and Denotation: A St'udy in Semantical Theory. By R. M. MARTIN. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1958. Pp. xii + 304. 42s. PROFESSOR MARTIN surveys most of the modern work on syntax and semantics in the logical sense, and adds some interesting devices of his own. For a variety of first order object-languages, semantical metalanguages of different kinds are set up in great detail, and theorems in them pains- takingly deduced. The philosophical standpoint advocated is what Martin calls 'first-order constructivism '; what this is, is best understood by contrast with extreme nominalism in the Quine-Goodman sense, which Martin characterises by three doctrines: (1) the language used must be first-order (quantification only over ' individuals '); (2) an explicit infinity is not assumed in the domain; (3) the entities of the domain are in some sense ' concrete '. First-order constructivism requires (1), but does not insist on (2) or (3). Nonetheless, Martin is obviously attracted by extreme nominalism: two chapters are devotedto 'inscriptional semanties', where the variables range over sign-events (ink-marks, etc., thus satisfying</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS 275 (3)) and the spatio-temporal framework in which they are found is not assumed to be infinite (thus satisfying (2)). There are three main approaches to logical semantics, which Martin distinguishes carefully (pp. 172 ff.). (a) The metalanguage contains no semantical primitive terms; all such terms, including 'truth', are intro- duced by definitions. This was Tarski's original method, and it is only possible if the metalanguage is of higher order than the object-language, as Tarski's work shows. This approach, for this reason, has little appeal for Martin, and there is not much about it in the book. (b) The metalanguage contains semantical primitives, in terms of which other semantical concepts are definable; here the metalanguage remains itself a first-order language, if the object-language is first-order. Many choices of a primitive term are possible, including the truth-predicate itself. Martin illustrates this approach in detail by a study of the primitive 'a den x ', with the meaning 'the predicate a denotes (in M?ill's sense) the individual x'. (c) A non- translational approach: it is common to (a) and (b) that the object- language, including its non-logical axioms, reappears as a part of the metalanguage (without this feature it would be impossible in fact to prove in the latter that all theorems of the former were true). Martin succeeds, in several chapters, in setting up a new kind of semantics, in which this requirement is dropped: a primitive 'a comprh b' is adopted, to mean 'the predicate a denotes everything which b denotes'; semantical con- cepts are thus defined in a language which has as its domain expressions of the object-language, but which does not contain the language itself. Martin attaches some importance to approach (c), though it has certain drawbacks, in particular that it is no longer provable that all theorems are true without added hypotheses and that the Tarski adequacy criteria for the truth-definition (' S is true if and only if p ') are no longer even statable in the metalanguage. Like Tarski and Carnap, Martin claims that certain philosophical puzzles are solved by the creation of semantical metalanguages: in particular, concerning truth he writes: 'the age-old problem as to the meaning of the truth-predicate has been wholly clarified, where one restricts attention to formalised language-systems of a certain kind' (p. 125). This reviewer doubts whether the truth-definitions given by Martin are a satisfactory explication of the truth-concept even for formal systems. In the first place, approach (b) above, however formally interesting, seems unlikely to solve philosophical puzzles, since the primitives adopted are in general as mysterious as the concept of truth itself-if someone understands the denoting relation then of course he knows what truth is: this only moves the puzzle one stage back. From this point of view, Tarski's approach (a), neglected by Martin for ' constructivist ' reasons, is far more illuminating. In the second place, however, even approach (a) has its limitations: if the object-language possesses axioms which are externally false then in the corresponding metalanguage they will turn out trivially to be true by the truth-definition, just because the metalanguage incorporates the axioms of the object-language. No proper account is given of what we understand ordinarily by the truth of the non-logical axioms, say of a formalised theory of physics. Approach (c), therefore, which lacks this question-begging defect, seems superficially very attractive, but its merits are only those of silence. The metalanguage here just does not pronounce on the truth of the axioms, we cannot prove that the theorems are plain true (or false), and, although we can see intuitively that ' It is snowing ' will be true if and only if it is snowing, the metalanguage does not tell us this. Formal semantics 18</page><page sequence="7">276 NEW BOOKS may indeed help to clarify the philosophical problems that cluster round the truth-concept, as does much formal work, but has not so far fully explicated the concept itself. E. J. LEMMON Ethics. By CHARLES A. BAYLIs. Henry Holt and Company, 1958. Pp. x + 373. $4.50. THis is a textbook for college students that takes the form of a connected treatise on the whole field of ethical theory from the author's viewpoint. Books of this type seem to spring from the desire of lecturers to find a wider audience for the fruits of their teaching experience (even if they have notLing very new to offer), fostered by a demand on the part of incompetent, lazy or merely over-worked teachers for a textbook that will do most of their work for them, even to the provision of questions for discussion. But of its kind Professor Baylis' book is a very good example. It is lucid in language, neither over-technical nor chatty; it is clear in its main outlines witl out sacrifice of careful detailed argument; it is at once fair-minded and positive; and it is sufficiently inclusive in the number and variety of recognised theories discussed without being cluttered with side-issues and curiosities. TLe tLeory put forward in the book is a version of hedonistic utilitarian- ism carefully framed to avoid MIill's ambiguities and to meet subsequent criticisms. In a sense Baylis thus does AMill, and us, a service, for criticism of Mill has too often fastened upon incidental obscurities and on fallacies more apparent than real. For example, whereas Mill gives some excuse (not much) for the accusation that he commits the so-called naturalistic fallacy, Baylis specifically avoids it by taking the normative term 'prefer- able ' as primitive (though not inherently indefinable) and defining 'right ', 'duty' and 'good ' in terms of it. Incidentally, this procedure suggests a confusion bet-een definition in a formal system and definition as a process of conceptual analysis; the symbolic paraphernalia of '". . . " = df. " . . . " ' which is the normal badge of formal stipulation is out of place here. The choice of primitive terms in a formal system is arbitrary in a way that the decision whether to define, say, 'good 'in terms of ' right ' or 'right' in terms of 'good' is not; and the only terms which might reasonably be called ' primitive 'are those which are indefinable in Moore's sense, if there are any; and in fact we are given a definition of' preferable' as 'worthy of preference'. Fay is replaces Mfill's celebrated but misleading argument about the "desired " and the " desirable " not by an appeal to intuition but by a theory which seems to me to say almost exactly what Mill was trying to say: namely that we discover what is intrinsically good (i.e. worthy of preference, desirable) by " finding things which are the objects of a large col erent set of controlled preferences " (p. 261). The argument to the effect tLat pleasure is the " conferring characteristic of intrinsic goodness " (or ground of goodness) also, as in Mill, purports to be empirical (see pp. 263-270, and 287-288); we discover on enquiry that those other things such as knowledge, beauty and virtue which are alleged to be intrinsic goods are in fact preferred either for their consequences or because the exj erience of them is pleasant. But one scents another misconception of metlod here; it is a queer sort of empiricism which bases its knowledge of people's controlled preferences not on asking (even thoughtful) people</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS 277 what they prefer but on subjecting claims which contradict the author's thesis to philosophical analysis! Indeed, the misconception is fundamental, for even if Baylis succeeded in showing that all pleasant experiences and nothing else were regarded as preferable by all men, one could hardly show that pleasure was the ground of goodness by empirical means; and Baylis seems to have missed the one argument fatal to hedonism-that pleasure, when not confused with ancillary pleasurable sensations, is not a distinct psychological state which is produced by an experience as a by-product, but a state which has that experience as its internal object-a delighting-in-the-experience. We must not say, as Baylis does, that the sadist (a) tortures, which is bad because it produces unpleasant consequences, and (b) gets pleasure, which is good; what the sadist does is to enjoy torturing, and the enjoyment of the bad is bad; in fact, the pleasure makes it worse-an unwilling torturer is less depraved. Perhaps Baylis has in mind the fact that the resulting sexual sensations are not bad in themselves (if he is thinking of sadism in the original sense); but if so he is confusing pleasure with ancillary pleasurable sensations. This is not the place for an extended re-examination of hedonistic utilitarianism. Those who share the writer's dissatisfaction with it will find exactly the troubles they expect to find in a competent exposition of a theory which at best vacillates between a reduction of morality to self- interest (affection, e.g. is inherently good because " it warms us inwardly when we genuinely care about others "-p. 308) and a recognition of obligation to others for which no satisfactory explanation is ever found. It is of no use to say that the experience of happiness is " intrinsically good no matter who has it " and that therefore your happiness is a good for me; this only replaces Mill's fallacy of comyosition by a fallacy of ambiguity. The bald fact is that I must be ab!e to relate my duty to my nature in some wav or other (every good is a good for some being), and the hedonist escapes egoism only by a sophistry. If, for tPe sake of argument, Baylis were to accept pleasure as (ceteris paribus) an identifving characteristic of the good and self-realisation as the conferringf characteristic, instead of the other way about, and if self-realisation were to be found in self-less love, then to confine the agent's duty to seeking the good-for-him would not lead to egoism at all. One's enthusiasm for the many good things in this book will depend on how far one is content to travel splendidly and arrive in the wrong place. I have discussed the merits of the presentation and the defect3 of the argument as though only the first were re evant to the pedagogic value of a textbook. How far this is so I leave it to the reader to decide. N. J. BROWN Religion and the Scientific Outlook. By T. R. MILES. George Allen and Unwin, London, 1959. Pp. 223. 21s. IN a book intended perhaps more for the lay-reader than the professional philosopher Mr. Miles has concerned himself with " a single set of problems, those raised by the claims of religion in an age which has been largely dominated by the growth of science ". The set is a large one and, some readers will regret the thinness of a blanket stretched so widely. Part I contains an account of the recent revolution in philosophy. Having outlined the tenets of logical positivism (paying particular</page><page sequence="9">278 NEW BOOKS attention to the jettisoning of religion) Mr. Miles discusses the development from positivism of contemporary philosophy (which is more kindly dis- posed towards the religious and the theological). At this point IXr. Miles's treatment is distinctive. Other writers tend to emphasize the abandonment of the verification principle. Mr. Miles hangs on to a " reformulation " of it. Contemporary philosophy for him is part of the scientific outlook and it is adult positivism. Its tool is a mild verifica- tion principle; its war-cry, 'Down with the "Absolute-existence" fallacy'. Crudely, this fallacy consists in forgetting that "the only assertions which refer to what really exists are empirical ones ". In Part II Mr. Miles discusses Materialism, Behaviourism, Determinism, Psychical Research and Psycho-analysis. His aim is to discover whether " (1) Science has disproved the existence of God, (2) There is a conflict between science and religion, and (3) It is reasonable for a person living in the twentieth century to accept some form of Christian orthodoxy ". Mr. Miles answers " no " to (1) and (2), and " yes " to (3). His answers spring from the general argument that there cannot (logically) be any conflict between any empirical facts and the central claims of religion. Nor can 'favourable ' facts (e.g. those revealed by physical research) strengthen the case for religion. The contrary belief rests on committing the absolute-existence fallacy. Mr. Miles's view is similar to that held by other recent writers. The distinctive thing is, again, his application of one logical principle. Part III is an account of Mr. Miles's own very interesting theory. The way for religion is " the way of silence qualified by suitable parables ". One is reminded of Professor Braithwaite. Mr. Miles has thought of him too and has quickly dissociated himself from such a " harsh presenta- tion " of the theory. But surely it is not merely a " superficial resemb- lance ". The key problems may be more obvious in Professor Braith- waite's excited exposition than they are in Mr. Miles's more cautious alliance of faith with scepticism, but they are the same key problems. The theory will indeed " leave many Christians dissatisfied ". There is scope here for detailed criticism. Instead, one general point: Mr. Miles insists that a man's choice of parable must not be a haphazard irresponsible choice. But the burden of Parts I and II is to persuade us in general and in detail that no facts, if they are genuine facts, are relevant to a criticism of the Christian parable. What is relevant ? If the tradi- tional use of reason is misguided then we require working instructions for a new legitimate use. Seen as a criticism of the worst abuses of literalist picture language in religion Mr. Miles's thesis is illuminating and important. Pushed to the extreme as an account of the nature of every utterance in the complex world of religion it is disappointing. G. E. DE GRAAFF Philosophy in the lllid-Century, A Survey. Vol. I: Logic and Philosophy of Science; Vol. II: Metaphysics and Analysis; Vol. III: Values, History and Religion. Edited by RAYMOND KLIBANSKY. Firenze, La Nuova Italia Editrice, 1958. Pp. xi + 336, 218 and viii + 232. THIS is the first of the new series of five yearly Surveys to be issued under the auspices of the International Institute of Philosophy and it is, as its Editor claims, notably more comprehensive in scope than its predecessors.</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS 279 The period under survey runs from 1949 to the enid of 1955, though in general these dates serve as a focus rather than as strict limits. Only three of the four volumes which male up the set have in fact been received for review-No. IV on the H.istory of Philosophy alnd on contemporary work in Eastern Europe and Asia is missing-but as far as can be told from these three, there can hardly be any main topic of current philoso- phical interest, from the Foundations of Mathematics to Existentialism, from A.esthetics in Italy to Logic in Poland, that is not treated in one way and/or another. Nearlv all the articles are accompanied by more or less extensive bibliographies of books and articles; and all are either in Engflish or in French. It is inevitable that the nature and quality of the contributions to sucih a work should be very variable. While Dingle, for exam-ple, strings together no less than forty-four laconic abstracts in his three condensed pages on PhyTsics and Philosophy in Great Britaini, Gonseth on the other hand develops a ' vue d'ensemble' of the Philosophy of Science over no less than seventy-two pages, ending with a bibliography half the length. of Dingle's ; an-d Niels Bohr for his part contributes a statenment on Quantum Physics anid Philosophy which has no concern with bibliographies at all. There are other sorts of variations. Volume I opens with two characteris- tically vigorous pages by Quine wlhichl include the remark that n-ominalism 'is incompatible with most of mathematics anid much else that is best in science'; which are followed by a survey of developments in logic in which Feys refers i.n passing, to ' Quine's nominalism '. rlere are also, and most properly, wide differences of outlook between the various con- tributors; but these nmay sometimes lead to certain oddities of selection and classification. Popper, for instance, receives the prominent and res- pectful mention that one mioht expect in Watkins' account of the Philo- sophy of History, but none at all under the heading of Social and Political Thought; while L. Goldmann appears under neither of these heads, but does under that of Etlhics. In natural compensation, as it mere, there are a considerable number of overlaps : Wittgenstein, for example, receives at least three shiorter expositions as wel.t as an article to himself. Suclh. discrepancies and repetitions are, of course, the price to be paid for the liberty that has been left to each contributor to fashion his contribution in the way that he thinks best, and are riot seriously to be gruimbled at; though some readers may well wish that the Editor had gone in for very much more explanatory cross-referencing anid so left them slightly less to the insecurity of their own devices. It would be wrong, however, to end oni a note of complainit. lThe itten- tion of the work was after all modest enough: 'to provide a kind of general map for those who wish to look beyond familiar territory and want to find their bearings in a bewildering landscape--a rough map, indeed, in which some parts are in clear focus, some appear a little blurred, while yet others remain uncharted.' This intention has been very reasonably fulfilled, an-d as a work of initial reference tho Survev will prove useful indeed. To wbich it should be added that manv of the articles are first rate in their own right, and that some of them may very well serve, as does Quin.ton's presentation of Linguistic Analysis for example, as works of general introduction as well as of reference. W, hile if anyone should wish to learn how to set about writing a survey, he could certainly do no better than turn to Frankena's review of Ethics, comprehensive in every sense of the word, for an outstanding example of all that a survey should be. ALAN MOONTEFIORE</page><page sequence="11">280 NEW BOOKS Philosophical Papers. By G. E. MOORE. Allen and Unwin. 30s. THIS collection contains eleven papers, including famous ones like "Is Existence a Predicate? ", " A Defence of Common Sense " and " Proof of an External World ". Two of the papers have not been published before. They are lectures which Moore gave in America. One is called " Four Forms of Scepticism " (given in 1940) and the other is called " Certainty " (1941). In these two papers Moore raises and discusses many questions about knowledge, certainty and possibility. For example, in " Certainty" he raises and discusses the questions: if someone says that p is certain, does his assertion imply that he himself knows for certain that p, or does it merely imply that someone or other knows for certain that p, or neither? And again: if p is contingent does it follow from that' that no-one knows for certain that p? Or that it is possible that p is false? Or that it is logically possible that p is false? Or that it is logically possible that not-p is true? Or that p is not certain? The examples he takes of contingent propositions are ones which imply the existence of " a world external to the mind of the person making the assertion ", and are test cases for decid- ing between " the only real alternatives ", namely, between the view that " none of us ever knows for certain of the existence of anything external to his own mind " and the view that " millions of us constantly do ". The " Four Forms of Scepticism " are illustrated with reference to Russell's Outline of Philosophy and his Analysis of Mind. The four forms concern memory: whether it can be known that one has pereeptions: whether it can be known that there are some other minds: and whether it can be known that there are some physical objects. Moore argues that sceptical arguments rest on assumptions which are either false (for instance the assumption, whieh Moore disputes in more than one place, that from the assertion " it is possible that p might have been, or may be, false," one can justifiably infer that it is possible that p is false), or else are less certain than the truth of the propositions whose uncertainty sceptical arguments are designed to prove.

This is a sustained attempt to get rid of or make plainer the Philosophically Troublesome. Its arguments are often not without appeal. Of certain words it is argued that they have implications in informative sentences and lack them in the troublesome. In every case the trouble- some is considered in the light of how its words behave in informative sentences. " Property " won't do as a predicate (p. 11) and sense data are spoken of at least in part because an expression is used out of place (p. 24) oven if they might be a discovery (p. 26). Determinism is either an absurdity-we cannot imply we have reasons to admit universal propositions of which we also want to say we know nothing-or it is an imprecise statement. synthetic, of which one has to ask whether the facts justify it (pp. 46-47). Concerning Free Will we are told that we don't envisage causes of voluntary actions and quite a few other things besides, e.g. that sentences of the form " At the moment at which 0 finished doing B, he could do other than finish doing B ", will not be used by us, unless we think that 0 had a reason or motive for not doing B (p. 55). P. MmIUS-BENE8</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS 281 The Concept of Morality. By PRATIMA BOWES. George Allen and Unwin Ltd., 1959. Pp. 215. 21s. MRs. BOWES, as her title implies, has undertaken a much-needed inquiry: what is it we are discussing in discussing morality? what are the distin- guishing characteristics of moral as distinct from other forms of criticism, principle, code and so on? It is refreshing to read a book on ethics that talks, and not merely in passing, of such things as justice. Unfortunately, however, Mrs. Bowes undertakes too much. She puts forward a modified intuitionist theory, and feels called upon to show, in turn, how the anti- intuitionist arguments of Messrs. Stevenson, Strawson, Hare, Nowell- Smith and others are not decisive. The form of argument tends to be: " X objects to theoretical ethics because it is neither deductive nor induc- tive; but Geometrical Optics is neither. The moral approach to ex- perience is a characteristic approach like the approach of Geometrical Optics " (p. 53), and then the hint is not developed. Long passages of such defensive argument, without any clear idea of what is defended make hard reading. It is made harder by the fact that it is not easy from the whole to discover quite what Mxs. Bowes' view is: quite what value facts or a value point of view are. Thus page 94: " Arnd such understanding (of why everyone would agree that a certain kind of act ought not to be done) can only come from the realisation that the principle involved in the undertaking of such acts rather than its opposite expresses some facts which a rational being, looking at human conduct from a value point of view, cannot but take cognizance of." Yet from page 98 this rationality is connected with emotions, and in chapter V with desire for happiness, and at page 92 with treating others as ends. The interrelations are not explained. There are many suggestive remarks, for instance about self-evidence, and about the distinction between 'particular moral codes ' and 'general moral principles of an abstract nature', but these positive elements are never sufficiently developed and tied together. Yet it would have been interesting to have more of them; whereas the last chapter, in which various forms of determinism are briefly discussed and dismissed, could well have been dispensed with. For determinism is interpreted as under- mining the possibility of moral criticism; it is not in any way a view of what is the characteristic form of such criticism; it is thus an entirely new topic; and her desire to be defended on all fronts leads Mrs. Bowes to be less than adequate on the subject. J. GosLING Vom Ursprung und Ende der Metaphysik. By ERNST TorITscn. Vienna, Springer Verlag, 1958. Pp. 320. ti2/4/6. THE author's aim is ambitious: by means of a ' genetic historical analysis' he attempts to explain the origin, development, and dissolution of meta- physics. He acknowledges Emile Durkheim, Vilfredo Pareto, Hans Kelsen and Heinrich Gomperz as predecessors in this field; in his subtitle he revives the term 'WVeltanschauungskritik'. According to Professor Topitsch, the rise of mythological thought and later of metaphysics follows a simple scheme. Man interprets what is unknown and alien to him in terms of models taken from his immediate</page><page sequence="13">282 NEW BOOKS environment. He uses ' biomorphic models', such as birth and growth, and 'intentional models', which draw upon the arts and, crafts and other social activities; the author subdivides these latter models, in turn, into those that are ' sociomorphic ' and those that are ' technomorphic '. Thus man has interpreted the cosmos ' technomorphically ' as a work of art, and 'sociomorphically', as a political institution, on the assumption that the cosmos is planned in the way in which human actions may be thought to be planned. This 'projection' procedure, wherein human actions or intentions are imputed to the cosmos, is usually followed by a 'reflection' procedure: man then takes this anthropomorphic cosmos as a prototype for his own activities. The laws of the 'cosmic city ', for instance, become norms for human society (pp. 78, 126, 198, 288 f.). Drawing upon a vast amount of material, Topitsch makes use of this scheme in dealing with the forms of thought that are basic to myth (pp. 5- 32), with the rise and fall of ' Hochmythologie ', and, in the principal and most suggestive part of his book, with the 'cosmos in philosophy' (pp. 95- 221). In its late and fading stages mythology is refined into metaphysics. Topitsch traces the development of metaphysics up to the time of late Hellenism in considerable detail; medieval philosophy, the Renaissance, and the Enlightenment are treated much more briefly. In the chapter ' Tradition, Ideology, and Science ' (pp. 222-280), he investigates the decay and final disappearance of the 'intentional' world view. The Enlighten- ment and Marxism are Janus-like: their basic concepts were taken over from metaphysics; their primary aim, however, was scientific and they contributed to the end of metaphysics and the ' victory ' of modern science over the intentional world view. Other factors contributing to the end of metaphysics, were the change of social institutions, the industrial revolu- tion, and the resulting change in man's basic attitudes towards the world (pp. 264 ff.). In a book covering so much material, certain limitations are almost inevitable. Thus the author's own conceptual scheme is not as precise as it might be. Such terms as 'model', 'illustration', 'sample' and ' analogy' are used throughout the book, but they are not formally defined and they are not always clearly distinguished. The fact that we find similar concepts at different times and in different contexts does not in itself justify us- in speaking of the same concepts or models. But the author's approach to the concept of 'WTeltanschauung ' is useful and rewarding. And although some may find it difficult to follow Topitsch's identification of the intentional world-view with metaphysics, and others may take exception to the ' sociomorphic ' treatment of Kant (pp. 237 f.), the historical discussion is sound and suggestive throughout. RUDOLF HALLER The Hollow UTniverse. By CHARLES DE KONINCK. Oxford University Press, 1960. Pp. xii + 127. 12s. 6d. THERE iS certainly much to commend the treatment of present-day mathe- matics, epistemology and biology together as sharing certain characteristics. The progress made in all these fields is due largely to the adoption of an ' operational' or 'functionalist' point of view, in contrast with the earlier essentialist one. Professor De Koninck is careful not to deny any of the</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS 283 results achieved through this way of looking at things, yet his whole book is devoted to showing that the philosophy underlying this approach is faulty. Probably the most revealing thing is his treatment of mathematics. He seems to be worried about the fact that mathematicians treat '1 ? 1 ' and ' 2 'as the same, i.e. they do not think that ' 2 ' is anything above and beyond ' 1 ? 1'. Now, there is some justification for a certain uneasiness here, in so far as it is true that the axiomatic conception of mathematics does not exhaust our ordinary intuitions about numbers. If I say that an orange costs fivepence but for a shilling one can get three of them, then what I mean here is not exhaustible by translating it into a statement made in terms of the various successors of ' 1'. This problem is well- known to mathematicians, yet none of them has attempted to cure this defect through the acception of an essentialist metaphysics as De Koninck seems to do. Indeed, the universe is hollow for the author because it has been emptied of essences (in the case just discussed, of ' twoness '), and we are no longer concerned 'witn definable natures, nor with the properties demonstrable from the definition of " what they are " absolutely, taken as middle term (p. 13). All this is based on a theory of meaning which has been nicknamed by Professor Ryle as the '"Fido "-Fido theory'. Unfortunately, this theory is held in all seriousness by De Koninck. '. . . we cannot help noticing that our words, unless forced into the role of mere symbols, are not the indifferent, objective counters that our symbols are. The reason is that, by the very fact that they are words, they must bear one or several meanings, which suppose a knower and relate them to a knower. What words stand for is something which we have got to know before we can use them as words' (p. 31). It is not at all clear to me, what the expression ' what words stand for ' stands for. Is it the meaning of the word or is it the object the word is a name of, or (and I am inclined to think that this is the view of the author) is the object the meaning of the word? It has become a commonplace that not all words are names or function as names. Books, like the one under discussion, can serve as a useful reminder that this commonplace is no mean achievement and what consequences follow from disregarding it. There is hardly an argument which is not affected by this odd theory of meaning. (Cf. about 'names' on p. 9, discussion of Socrates' identity on p. 33; the treatment of ' good' as an ' analogical term ' on p. 108, etc.) There are various asides in this book contra the 'analytical philosophers'. It is a pitv that what is probably the only doctrine unanimously rejected by them should have been assumed by the author without argument. GERSHON WEMLER Reality, Reason and Religion. By ARTHUR ANTON VOGEL. London, Longmans, Green and Co., 1959. Pp. 208. Price 30s. THE author's avowed intention in this book is to " examine, explicate, and criticize the type of explanation called metaphysical, which had its defini- tive origin in the thought of Aristotle " (p. viii), but he has two other subsidiary aims as well. He wants, firstly, to bring out the contrast</page><page sequence="15">284 NEW BOOKS between positivist and metaphysical approaches to the question of explana- tion, and secondly, to discuss some of the implications for the philosophy of religion of metaphysical explanation as expounded by him. Dr. Vogel who stands in the Neo-Thomist tradition, introduces the reader to the task in hand, and to the technical vocabulary required for coping with it, by giving a brief outline of the Aristotelian metaphysical position. Meta- physical explanation, according to Dr. Vogel's interpretation of the Aris- totelian tradition, is a matter of relating finite things to being qua being, and as they are so related through their causes the task is to explicate fur- ther the nature of being and the doctrine of causation. This the author does by considering first the positivist position and its criticism of meta- physics. He throws into sharp relief the emphasis upon phenomeno'ogy, methodology and epistemological construction which he finds evident in the arguments of certain historical and contemporary positivists (e.g. Comte, Mill, Ayer), and complains that they have reduced reality to sen- sations, ideas, and constructs of these, and that they have abandoned causal relations in favour of predictive techniques. Having depicted positivism in this light, the author sets against it the Aristotelian doctrine of the intentional nature of thought according to which being is prior to sensation, concept and judgement, and the causal nexus prior to logical necessity. Being-itself and the causal nexus, which any philosophy worthy of the name must investigate since they are basic for the understanding of reality, are not observable items nor are they amenable to the experimental method. Positivism, it is held, goes wrong in prescribing the observable realm as the only legitimate field of enquiry and ruling out metaphysical terminology as nonsensical. Vogel proceeds to give an analysis of being in terms of existence and essence, act and potency, form and matter, substance and accident, along the usual Aristotelian-Thomist lines. This is followed by an exposition of the meta- physical notion of cause, and its intelligible grounding is shown by relating it to the principles of (a) sufficient reason and (b) contradiction. Vogel deals ably with the complicated theme of these central sections of his book, but those who have initial doubts about the significance of his terminology will find the argument tortuous. Given his metaphysical position Vogel is able to go on to make a strong plea for a rational, as opposed to the rather popular present-day mystical and irrational, approach to religious questions. He can also turn a critical eye on other metaphysical arguments within, and without, the Thomist tradition. He criticizes the Thomist doctrine of physical premotion which was intended to solve the problem of God's relations to human free-will, and in his last chapter he attacks the existentialist theism of Paul Tillich. Vogel realizes that one always stands to gain by playing against an extreme position, and he does score off the positivists to some extent in that their rejection of metaphysics becomes quasi-metaphysical itself at times (see p. 68, 2nd par.). Vogel's own view, however, is ambiguous at cardinal points, for he seems to regard as metaphysical certain claims which on the face of it appear to have no sense other than a trivial logical one. In his discussion of being-a notion which is fundamental for his thesis-he says that " everything manifests " it, and that " there is nothing which does not " (p. 70), and he insists that this claim is not verifiable by experiment. One might concede that the claim still has some significance if it is construed as purely logical, but Vogel ignores such an interpretation and proceeds as though the claim must be a profoundly metaphysical one. One further suspects that he is assuming metaphysical significance on the</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS 285 basis of what is purely logical when, after pointing out that being cannot be defined but only characterized (p. 81), he says that being is primarily characterized by the principle of non-contradiction (pp. 92 f:). Perhaps those who can stomach the doctrine of intentionality expounded in the book will not be troubled by the point I have raised, but many will find that doctrine itself indigestible. 0. R. JONES Hobbes. By RICHARD PETERS. Penguin Books, 1956. 3s. 6d. HOBBES'S political philosophy has always been well-known in England. Onlv experts usually know anything of his general philosophical svstem, of which his political philosophv was a part. Mr. Peters's book is a serious attempt to remedy this situation. In the compass of 250 paoes or so it deals with the whole range of Hobbes's philosophical speculations. These include his views about scientifio method, about body, motion, space, time, or what would be called his philosophy of nature, about sensation, imagination, memory, thought, or his philosophy of mind, about language and his theory of names and of universals, about the emotions and their connections with such moral notions as duty and free- will, about the state, law, political obligation, and the relations between Church and State. This is a formidable list of topics. To cope with it at all it was necessary, inevitably, to simplify the discussion and to treat most topics in a fairly summary manner. The result is nevertheless a work of scholarship as well as an introduction to Hobbes for the general reader. Hobbes's main purpose, accordirng to Peters, is to apply a method, properly called the resoluto-compositive method. The essentials of this method were to take a typical example of a certain phenomenon (e.g. that of a falling body), think away thoc3e characteristics which were presumed irrelevant to the question in hand (e.g. the colour of the body), resolve the others (e.g. weight, height of fall, etc.), into components which could be quantified, and then elicit if possible a mathematical formula which would represent some of these components as functions of the others. Hobbes's originality was not that he used this method, which had previously been used by Galileo and others, but that he tried to apply it to man, society, and nature all at once. He hoped in this way to explain the behaviour of men in society as a special case of the motion of bodies having sense organs and animal spirits, and his accounts of the state of nature and of the original contract are the direct outcome of the application of this method. Peters shows without any difficulty that this method can provide constructive results only if the hypotheses to which it leads have further consequances which can be tested by observations. It was this, more than tne use of the method, which accounted for the successes of Galileo. Yet this was the point which Hobbes signally failed to see. He failed to see the decisive role of sensory observation in deciding between hypotheses. His greatest achievement therefore was that he should have been wrong in the same way as the natural scientists were in their beliefs about the use of the method. The objective attitude towards the study of man and society which made such a mistake possible was an advance in the European intellectual tiadition.</page><page sequence="17">286 NEW BOOKS As to the detailed development of his systemn, Hobbes is shown to have been fairly uniformly unsuccessful, despite some original and valuable insights. His overriding weakness was a failure to distinguish philoso- phical from scientific questions. While he tries to reduce conceptual problems into factual or scientific ones, his discussion of genuinely scientific questions is usually speculative and heavily tinged with metaphysics, In fact, as one reads on, one comes to feel more and more that Hobbes was essentially a provocative genius with a second-rate mind, a master of the flippant remark and a man of wide knowledge, but a thinker more than necessarily confused by the overlapping of science and philosophy which was characteristic of the age. If only for this reason alone, the reader may well find this a disappointing book. But he should consider well to what extent his disappointment is disappointment with Hobbes rather than with the author. Having read the book more than once, and further re-read many parts of it, my own respect for it has steadily grown. It is a well-documented work. Peters has drawn upon the whole corpus of Hobbes's extensive writings and, in admirably unobtrusive footnotes, has indicated in detail the sources on which he relies for the development of his exposition. He observes a judicious balance between exposition and comment, and while exposition is clear and careful, comment is always sensible and proceeds from generally accepted and uncontroversial premisses. The work does not contain any profoundly new insights about Hobbes, but it is a patient, constructive and fair-minded commentary. It is, in short, the best treatment of Hobbes's general philosophy now available to English readers. I noticed one elementary mistake. This is the statement that Galileo discovered the planet Neptune (p. 15). Galileo is famous, of course, for the discovery of the satellites of Jupiter. W. J. REES Plaidoyer d'un Socratique contre le Phedre de Platon: XXVIe Discours de Themistius. Introduction, texte 6tabli et traduit par IHUBERT KESTERS. Nauwelaerts, Louvain (Paris: Beatrice-Nauwelaerts), 1959. Pp. xv + 296. 290 FB. MR. KESTERS wishes to date the 26th Discourse hitherto ascribed to the (A.D.) fourth-century orator Themistius contemporaneously with the Soc- ratic Apologies of Plato, Xenophon and Lysias. He regards it as being in its original state a work by some disciple of Socrates other than, and some- times opposed to, Plato; and as one which Plato must have known. Further, he tries to show that the Discourse is later than Republic I-IV, but precedes V-VII; that it deals directlywiththe firstpartofthe Phaedrus, the concluding section of which dialogue on the other hand is written in reply to some of the Discourse; and that the Clitophon is intended to treat the same subject as a whole. Lastly, Mr. Kesters wants to identify the Discourse as a work of Antisthenes, though Themistius is supposed to have made alterations to it. This thesis Kesters first presented in Dutch in 1931 (Philologische Studien, Louvain), and then in French in 1935. It was criticized in great detail by E. de Strycker in Archives de Philosophie (not Anne'e Philoso- phique, as stated in Kesters' bibliography), xii (1936), 181-206. To that elaborate critique, very little of which K. succeeds in meeting in this 1959</page><page sequence="18">NEW BOOKS 287 presentation of his thesis, it is unnecessary to add. De Strycker felt com- pelled to maintain, in my opinion correctly, that K.'s thesis was not merely unproven, but wrong. For not only is direct evidence in favour completely lacking, but if the Antisthenic hypothesis were true we should require an explanation for peculiarities which in Themistius are unsurpris- ing, but which would be remarkable in Antisthenes: quite apart from the late character of the language employed, and the constant borrowings from other prose-writers of Plato's time, the outlook expressed in the Discourse is vague and platitudinous, not what one would have expected from Antisthenes. These features are not adequately explained by the supposition that the Antisthenic original was doctored by Themistius to make it appear his own work. Moreover, there seem to be borrowings from works of Plato later than the supposed date of the Discourse, and K. has either to explain these as Plato borrowing from Antisthenes, even after many years, or deny that they are borrowings from Plato at all. For example, 331a 'Opqs ,rov-roi rO-v 'HAtov, o-v rpciyovov 'roD 'AT7ro'covog, (o)si rcayao6v acva&amp;\oyov av'ro be glosses over (pp. 83-84) as deriving from a non-extant passage of Prodicus, without referring to Republic VI 508b (pointed out by de Strycker) where the sun is said to be roti acyaOov EKYOVOV, of' Tacya0ov EyEvv?7aaE avdAoyov Eavwcr, ... (The Themistius passage must mean that the sun is the progenitor of Apollo, just as the Good is of the sun, but K. translates the last phrase ' comme le Bien lui ressemble ! '). Over half the book consists of the attempt to make out the Antisthenic hypothesis, but there is some discussion of the text, which appears with a sizeable apparatus and with a French translation en regard, and there are bibliographies and indexes to the book as a whole. The 26th Discourse has been previously printed, among the others, the 1st edition being that of Petau in 1613; but the last was that of Dindorf in 1832, so a new text and translation should be welcome. The text (with or without translation) can also be obtained separately. ROLAND HALL Received also L. Aqvist, The MIoral Philosophy of Richard Price, Lund, C. W. K. Gleerup, 1960, pp. 213, 20 Sw.kr.
