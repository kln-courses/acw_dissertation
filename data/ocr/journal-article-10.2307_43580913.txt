<plain_text><page sequence="1">BONDAGE, ACQUIESCENCE, AND BLESSEDNESS: SPINOZA'S THREE KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE AND SCENES OF CLERICAL LIFE by ANDREW B.LYNN University of Glasgow Early in 1860, George Eliot, who had gained almost overnight fame owing to the reception of Adam Bede , wrote to her publisher in connection with the issue of a "cheaper edition" of the Scenes : I am very anxious that the "Scenes of Clerical Life" should have every chance of impressing the public with its exis- tence: first, because I think it of importance to the esti- mate of me as a writer that 'Adam Bede' should not be counted as my only book; and secondly, because there are ideas presented in these stories about which I care a great deal, and am not sure I can ever embody again.1 It has been suggested that these "ideas" are related to George Eliot's "doctrine of sympathy."2 Other critics, while recognizing that the Scenes emphasize the need for sympathy, attribute its dominant philosophical tone to the influence of Feuerbach.3 George Eliot's translation of The Essence of Christianity appeared in 1854, but she also translated part of Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico- Politicus and all of the Ethics ,4 completing the latter only six months before she started to write "Amos Barton."5 The effect of this translation work on the development of George Eliot has re- ceived very little critical attention in respect of Spinoza,6 who represents a far more fundamental source of inspiration for the Scenes than Feuerbach's anthropological approach to religion.7 The "ideas" referred to in George Eliot's letter, I would sug- gest, are connected with Spinoza's philosophical, religious and po- litical program as outlined in the Tractatus and the Ethics. Spinoza promulgates a purified religion, based on certain nuclear concepts of human solidarity, and which seeks to use constructively - for social cohesion and political order - the hold that religious doctrine has on the multitude.8 It is a universal religion, a true religion di- vorced from anthropomorphism, but one that retains anthropomor- phic terms as part of a rhetorical strategy, while also seeking to 32</page><page sequence="2">evoke the mystical, esoteric and semi-religious overtones which are related to a Spinozistic ideal of a secular salvation.9 At the heart of the Tractatus is the problem of how to live with the multi- tude, the majority of which will not be able to move up the episte- mologica! scale and will live in the irrational and confused domain of the imag inato, which is the lowest grade of Spinoza's tripartite di- vision of kinds of knowledge.10 Spinoza illustrates all three kinds by way of a famous example of finding a fourth proportional: Let there be given three numbers in order to obtain a fourth, which shall be to the third what the second is to the first. Merchants are in no doubt as to the necessity of multiplying the second by the third and dividing the product by the first, because they have not yet forgotten what they have heard from their tutor without any demonstration or because they have often tried the same process with the simplest numbers, or on the ground of the demonstration of prop. 19, Book 7 of Euclid, that is to say, on the ground of a common property of proportionals. But in the simplest numbers there is no need of this demonstration. For exam- ple, given the numbers 1, 2, 3, no one fails to see, that the fourth proportional number is 6, and this kind of cognition is much clearer than the others, because from the ratio that we intuitively see the first to have to the second, we conclude the fourth.11 The first kind of knowledge is the domain of the masses - the ig- norant multitude who live in the realm of the imagination (imaginato). It is confused knowledge, or "cognition from vague experience" such as "things presented to the intellect in a muti- lated, confused, unorderly manner," as well as gossip and calumny. It can have as its basis subservience to authority: the tradesman in the example accepts his schoolmaster's general rule, and proceeds to make an inference in the particular case. The multitude have for the most part little access to the realm of "clear and distinct" or "adequate" ideas which constitute the second and third kinds of knowledge. The second kind is reason (ratio), and consists of "ade- quate common notions and ideas which we possess of the properties of things," and is illustrated in the example by the tradesman knowing the truths of geometry. He still uses the same rule as the 33</page><page sequence="3">tradesman who accepts the authority of the schoolmaster, but he can appreciate that the truth of the rule can be deduced logically from certain basic Euclidean axioms.12 Yet another tradesman has an "intuitive" grasp of the self evident nature of the rule as applied in a particular instance. This rather obscure doctrine of the third kind of knowledge is contrasted with the second kind in that we now no longer infer from the general to the particular, but we have an intuitive grasp of particulars without the need to infer from gen- eralities. This elevated and sublime kind of knowledge is what has been seen as the semi-mystical aspect of Spinoza's system; indeed, it is nothing less than salvation itself, for Spinoza a true salvation, a secular equivalent of what the mystics had always sought but failed to attain.13 This program for a universal religion will need to reinterpret the role of the clergy, and I should like to offer a reading which places the principal clerical characters in the Scenes, respectively, broadly within the realms of the three kinds of knowledge which inform Spinoza's schema.14 The series starts with the story of Amos Barton, who is representative of the domain of the multitude and its bondage to the inadequate and confused ideas of the first kind of knowledge. We then proceed to Mr. Gilfil, who, through a painful process of tragic suffering and loss, comes to the acquies- cent state of the second kind of knowledge, which relies on clear and distinct ideas, and who represents - in Spinozistic terms - the ideal type of clergyman, whose flock by his encouragement act in an imitation of the dictates of reason, even though they are inspired by the dubious grounding of the first kind of knowledge. The series is finished by the portrait of the Reverend Edgar Tryan, one of the rare individuals who reaches the "blessed" state of the third kind of knowledge, an intuitive knowledge of the relations of cause and ef- fect, which opens up the possibility of a truly secular salvation. He is one of the chosen few who achieves a Spinozistic transmutation of the soul, an equipoise which is a oneness with Substance, or God. "The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton" opens with the image of Shepperton church, which "was a very different- looking building five-and-twenty years ago."15 The narrator "re- call[s] with a fond sadness Shepperton Church as it was in the old days" (42), where "the innovation of hymn-books was as yet un- 34</page><page sequence="4">dreamed of," and "even the New Version was regarded with a melancholy tolerance. . . ." (43). Mr. Amos is immediately con- trasted unfavorably with "Mr. Gilfil, an excellent old gentleman, who smoked very long pipes and preached very short sermons." Mr. Gilfil is, of course, the subject of the next Scene, but his mer- its are immediately juxtaposed against Barton's demerits. Barton is "quite another sort of clergyman" (43), who breaks with tradi- tion and custom by his plan to rebuild Shepperton Church, by his disruption of the arrangements for the music at the services, and his doctrinal and exegetical excursions. Barton's preoccupation with doctrine and exegesis is totally out of harmony with the needs of the community. He is the wrong type of clergyman to guide the multitude constructively into an imitation of reason which will make for social cohesion and help avoid disintegration. The community is rife with gossip and calumny, which are two of the insidious and debilitating elements of the first kind of knowl- edge, and which characterize the level of apprehension of the multi- tude. Indeed, Amos Barton is no different from his parishioners in this respect: for all his university education, he is just as much in- fluenced by the vicissitudes of public opinion, as the scandal with the Countess demonstrates. Barton goes beyond the fundamental concepts of justice, mutual help and solidarity, and invokes tran- scendent and supernatural images (not to mention faulty syllo- gisms) which are not conducive to a reshaping of the collective imagination of the multitude, and reveals himself as materially and spiritually impoverished as his parishioners, as in this rebuke of Master Fodge in the workhouse scene: "Do you like being beaten?" "No-a." "Then what a silly boy you are to be naughty. If you were not naughty, you wouldn't be beaten. But if you are naughty, God will be angry, as well as Mr. Spratt; and God can burn you for ever. That will be worse than being beaten." Master Fodge's countenance was neither affirmative nor negative of this proposition. "But," continued Mr. Barton, "if you will be a good boy, God will love you, and you will grow up to be a good man." (65) 35</page><page sequence="5">Barton, for all his "having gone through the Eleusinian myster- ies of a university education" (59), is firmly part of the climate of inadequate ideas which characterizes the multitude in its reliance on the first kind of knowledge. He is not qualified for the second kind of knowledge - reason - which relies on clear and distinct ideas; he is seen to be even more confused than his parishioners. He sim- ply adds to the inconstancy and confusion with his incoherent doc- trines, part Tractarian, part Low Church,16 which George Eliot seeks to satirize and demythologise.17 Barton's sermons deal with unnecessary abstractions, and his theological hermeneutics have a negative instead of a constructive effect, tending merely to dis- abuse the multitude from the beliefs that they have previously held on the basis of authority: The sermon in question, by the by, was an extremely ar- gumentative one on the Incarnation; which, as it was preached to a congregation not one of whom had any doubt of that doctrine, and to whom the Socinians therein con- futed were as unknown as the Arimaspians, was exceed- ingly well adapted to trouble and confuse the Sheppertonian mind. (73) Barton's theology is religion perverted; but while George Eliot seeks to criticize its transcendent aspect, she, following Spinoza, is aware of its powerful influence on minds capable of vacillation. Barton's is one such mind: "He would march very determinedly along the road he thought best; but then it was wonderfully easy to convince him which was the right road" (67). In contrast to the egoistic and anthropomorphic Mr. Barton, the eponymous hero of "Mr. Gilfil's Love Story" speaks the language of the multitude, "for it was his habit to approximate his accent and mode of speech to theirs" (125). In terms of Spinoza's political and religious program, Mr. Gilfil represents the ideal clergyman, one who by promulgating basic doctrines of human solidarity, encour- ages the multitude to act in an imitation of the dictates of reason, which in turn helps to avoid the breakdown of society. Spinoza's universal religion will be divorced of its historical antecedents and theological baggage; it will be a true religion, with one brand of piety for the multitude, and another for those who use as their common currency the adequate ideas which characterize the realms 36</page><page sequence="6">of the second and third kinds of knowledge. Thus the rhetorical and metaphorical aspects take on great importance, and in the case of sermons, it is form, as much as content, which is significant. Even young Master Stokes, "a flippant town youth" (126), was able to write a sermon "so astonishingly like a sermon, having a text, three divisions, and a concluding exhortation beginning 'And now, my brethren'" (127). The multitude is in bondage to the inadequate ideas of the first kind of knowledge, and have metaphysical and theological notions which realistically cannot be expunged from their collective imagination. However, according to Spinoza's pro- gram, while the multitude acts in an imitation of the behavior of those, like Mr. Gilfil, who rely on reason, this will be used con- structively, and they will not be disabused of their inadequate ideas. While it is to be hoped that some of these purified ideas will filter down to the realm of the invaginato, and enable some members to live according to the dictates of reason, it is enough for the multitude (which by definition will always exist) to live in an ap- proximation of these dictates, even though the dubious ground of their apprehensions is the first kind of knowledge. After this introductory chapter, we proceed back in time to the Cheveral Manor of 1788, presided over by the pre-Romantic figure of Sir Christopher Cheveral. Here we also have an hermeneutic as- pect. Sir Christopher and Captain Wybrow cannot read and under- stand people: they simply look for externals, and are as sterile as the "picture" of the manor itself. Sir Christopher's "strong will" (213) and Wybrow's self-serving conception of "duty" (164), both of which conflict with George Eliot's intersubjective humanism, are contrasted to Caterina's inability to master her feelings, which is- sue forth in "ungovernable impulses" (198). She is one of those "emotional natures whose thoughts are no more than the fleeting shadows cast by feeling" (185). The only times when she ceases to be in bondage to this "conflict of emotions" (169) is when she sings, which is when she is able to enter "one of those moods of self-possession and indifference which comes at the ebb-tide be- tween the struggles of passion" (168). When she sings, she breaks free of the constraints of external modes, and becomes "active" in the Spinozistic sense; that is, she has a glimpse of the freedom that 37</page><page sequence="7">comes with self-determination, and recovers some sort of equilib- rium in the face of life's vicissitudes. In the middle of this dichotomy of will and feeling, and some- what open to attack from both sides, stands Mr. Gilfil, himself in love with Caterina. His intersubjective sensibility is in direct op- position to Sir Christopher's autonomy, Captain Wybrow's lack of genuine emotion, and to the egoism displayed by Mr. Barton in the previous story. He can read and understand people, and "did not deceive himself in his interpretation of Caterina's feelings" (162). When he comes to tell Caterina that the situation between her and Captain Wybrow "may lead to very bad consequences" (190), he shows that he understands the relations of cause and effect that constitute the web from which their lives are spun. He appears to understand that for the sake of the community of the manor he must encourage Caterina to follow the dictates of reason, even though her inspiration to follow these dictates might be grounded in the first kind of knowledge, her sense of wrong, for example, being "rather instinctive than reflective" (198). Gilfil's prescriptions are grounded in his understanding and reason, and on the "adequate" ideas of the second kind of knowledge; and even at his darkest hour, when he fears for Caterina's life, he still thinks "of the sad conse- quences for others as well as himself" (223). Gilfil's "human" ministrations, and "unspoken sympathy" help to humanize Sir Christopher as he tries to cope with the tragedy: "The first tears he had shed since boyhood were for Anthony" (224). We may note that while both men in this interview are using religious discourse, Sir Christopher's use is theological, while Gilfil's is rhetorical and metaphorical - they may speak in the same way, but Gilfil uses the language of transcendence to stress the immanence of our ethical realm: At last the Baronet mastered himself enough to say, "I'm very weak, Maynard - God help me! I didn't think anything would unman me in this way; but I'd built every- thing on this lad. Perhaps I've been wrong in not forgiving my sister. She lost one of her sons a little while ago. I've been too proud and obstinate." "We can hardly learn humility and tenderness enough except by suffering," said Maynard; "and God sees we are 38</page><page sequence="8">in need of suffering, for it is falling more and more heavily on us." (224) Again, Mr. Gilfil uses religious language rhetorically and metaphorically, as he attempts to persuade Tina that in ascribing blame to herself over her putative intention to kill Wybrow, she is judging events from a very limited perspective: "Tina, my loved one, you would never have done it. God saw your whole heart; He knows you would never harm a living thing. He watches over His children, and will not let them do things they would pray with their whole hearts not to do. It was the angry thought of a moment, and he for- gives you." (234) Gilfil's implicit position is close to Spinoza's: that God, or Nature, is the only free cause, and everything that happens is an emanation from his divine nature, and could not have happened in any other way.18 We are free in so far as we are self-determined, "active" individuals who are able to master the passions, and tap the source of genuine emotion.19 Tina herself locates the cause of her misery: she "was so full of bad passions" (234). Gilfil is not in bondage to these inadequate ideas: "They do not master me so." Gilfil's language has a religious aura, but is firmly rooted in imma- nence: "We are always doing each other injustice, and thinking better or worse of each other than we deserve, because we only hear and see separate words and actions. We don't see each other's whole nature. But God sees that you couldn't have committed that crime." (235) Gilfil's ministrations and Caterina's confessions cement their love and make for "a new consecration" (236), but it is music, significantly, which transforms Caterina from a passive to an "ac- tive" agent, allowing the shackles of finitude to be loosened: The vibration rushed through Caterina like an electric shock: it seemed as if that instant a new soul were entering into her, and filling her with a deeper, more significant life. . . . Maynard thanked God. An active power was reawak- ened, and must make a new epoch in Caterina's recovery. (240) 39</page><page sequence="9">U. C. Knoepflmacher argues that "Gilfil" has a more negative ending than "Amos,"20 but from a Spinozistic perspective this view cannot be sustained. Amos Barton remained in thrall to the ap- petites and passions of the first kind of knowledge, and is effec- tively banished from his community after Milly's death. Mr. Gilfil achieves the fairly rare state of the second kind of knowledge, which relies on clear and distinct ideas, and is "rewarded" at least by being able to taste "a few months of perfect happiness" (243) with Tina, who however must die for the ethical and philosophical impulse of the story to be fulfilled. In a letter to her publisher, George Eliot explains the real theme of "Janet's Repentance": The collision in the drama is not at all between "bigotted churchmanship" and evangelicalism, but between /Vreligion and religion. Religion in this case just happens to be repre- sented by evangelicalism. ... I thought I made it apparent in my sketch of Milby feelings on the advent of Mr. Tryan that the conflict lay between immorality and morality - irreligion and religion.21 Thus the town divides itself "into two zealous parties, the Tyranites and the anti-Tyranites," the former wishing "to establish a Sunday evening lecture on the grounds that old Mr. Crewe did not preach the Gospel," and the latter, led by the lawyer Dempster, now being "convinced . . . that Mr. Crewe was the model of a parish priest, and his sermons the soundest and most edifying that ever remained unheard by a church population." The uneducated towns- people are very responsive to Dempster's demagoguery, since they are in thrall to the first kind of knowledge. Despite his alcoholism, they are confident of his hermeneutic skills: "He's a long-headed feller, Dempster; why, it shows yer what a headpiece Dempster has, as he can drink a bottle o' brandy at a sittin', an' yit see further through a stone wall when he's done, than other folks 'li see through a glass winder." (257) Dempster himself is in almost complete bondage to the passions of the first kind of knowledge: he is "callous in worldliness, fevered by sensuality, enslaved by chance impulses." Even he is not altogether beyond redemption, however; the "deep-down fibrous 40</page><page sequence="10">roots of human love and goodness" surface in his relationship with his mother, and provide an experience of "close brotherhood with us through some of our most sacred feelings" (299). It is these "sacred" feelings of brotherhood and personal com- munion that are the basis of Mr. Jerome's attraction to Mr. Tryan and his ministry. Mr. Jerome "had not a theoretic basis for Dissent," it recommending itself to him simply "as piety and good- ness," and Mr. Tryan "as a good man and a powerful preacher, who was stirring the hearts of people" (305). The main redeeming feature of Evangelicalism, for all its faults, is palpably that of "duty, that recognition of something to be lived for beyond the mere satisfaction of self." The "divine work" which presents itself to Mr. Tryan's followers as a duty, however, is firmly other-directed, and though they seem to recognize a "higher" law, and hold transcendent notions, the practical effect of their conduct results in behavior which conforms to those basic concepts of justice, solidarity and compassion that are at the heart of George Eliot's reformulated Christianity, a religion rooted in immanence. Janet's suffering culminates in her ejection, at the hands of Dempster, from the family home, where she finds herself "on the confines of the unknown" (343), without even her restoring faith. Mrs. Pettifer - a Tryanite - takes her in, but Janet is still very much in thrall to the inadequate ideas of the first kind of knowledge, and completely determined by the actions of external modes, which is the antithesis of the free individual, who is free insofar as he or she is se/f-determined:22 "her thoughts, instead of springing from the action of her own mind, were external existences, that thrust themselves imperiously on her like haunting visions" (348). The one "untried spring" (350) amidst this desolation might be the in- fluence of Mr. Tryan, whose secrets of faith seem to offer some hope for her renovation. Their first meeting after the crisis is like a church service: "it was dusk, and the candles were lighted," and it is soon confirmed that Janet "had not deceived herself" (355) in her instinctive turning to Mr. Tryan, who has an intuitive grasp of the causes of her condition. Mr. Tryan's heartfelt confession shows that he once was in bondage to the passions, and his story redefines the tradi- 41</page><page sequence="11">tional formulations of theology. For Tryan, "sin" is bondage to the passions; and "strength" is the becoming of an "active" individual, reveling in the freedom of self-determination, and removing the shackles of finitude: "But a dear friend to whom I opened my mind showed me it was just such as I - the helpless who feel themselves help- less - that God especially invites to come to Him, and offers all the riches of His salvation: not forgiveness only; for- giveness would be worth little if it left us under the power of our evil passions; but strength - that strength which en- ables us to conquer sin." (357-58) And just like Janet, in his darkest hour Mr. Tryan found tra- ditional religion wanting: "I was convinced that if I ever got health and comfort, it must be from religion. I went to hear celebrated preach- ers, and I read religious books. But I found nothing that fitted my own need. The faith that puts the sinner in pos- session of salvation seemed, as I understood it, to be quite out of my reach. I had no faith; I only felt utterly wretched, under the power of habits and dispositions which had wrought hideous evil." (my italics, 360) It is clear that for Mr. Tryan, knowledge is understanding of the real meaning of faith and salvation, and he describes how through his reformulated religion, a true universal religion, he is able to breathe the "pure free air" of immanence: "As long as we live in rebellion against God, desiring to have our own will, seeking to have happiness in the things of this world, it is as if we shut ourselves up in a crowded stifling room, where we breathe only poisonous air; but we have only to walk out under the infinite heavens, and we breathe the pure free air that gives us health, and strength, and gladness. It is just so with God's spirit: as soon as we submit ourselves to his will, as soon as we desire to be united to him, and made pure and holy, it is as if the walls had fallen down that shut us out from God, and we are fed with his spirit, which gives us new strength." (361) For Tryan, "submit ourselves to his will" means realize the determined nature of our existence; and the "walls" which "shut us 42</page><page sequence="12">out from God," are external modes to which we are in bondage, and must be resisted to gain a sort of freedom which comes with the recognition and understanding of the determined nature of our im- manent realm. Indeed, the very idea of resignation and submission to an immanent reality, so crucial to an understanding of George Eliot's ethics, is seen to be "active" in the philosophical sense, at once resolving the seeming paradox between determinism and re- sponsibility: "We cannot foretell the working of the smallest event in our own lot; how can we presume to judge of things that are much too high for us? There is nothing that becomes us but entire submission, perfect resignation. As long as we set up our own will and our own wisdom against God's, we make that wall between us and his love which I have spoken of just now. But as soon as we lay ourselves entirely at his feet, we have enough light given us to guide our own steps; as the foot soldier who hears nothing of the councils that determine the course of the great battle he is in, hears plainly enough the word of command which he must obey." (362) Janet is now feeling a "new freedom," and has sensed a "blessed opening" (371) in the shape of Mr. Tryan, who can "di- vine" the difficulties that Janet will have to face along the road to redemption, and who will use his intuitive knowledge to summon up the shadowy reserves of semi-religious experience: "such unseen elements Mr. Tryan called the Divine will, and filled up the margin of ignorance which surrounds all our knowledge with the feelings of trust and resignation. Perhaps the profoundest philosophy could hardly fill it up better" (374). The reference to "the margin of ignorance" is an acceptance that our knowledge of the chain of cause and effect is necessary limited and partial; only God has complete knowledge and thus com- plete freedom in Spinoza's special sense of the term. But, as Spinoza says, if we "bear with equanimity" those things which seem to be "in opposition to our interest," and understand "that we are part of Nature, whose order we obey," we can gain a sort of freedom that comes with this understanding of our place within "the common order of universal nature."23 What Mr. Tryan chooses to 43</page><page sequence="13">call the "Divine Will," is not a transcendent notion: the "unseen el- ements" which constitute it are simply "feelings of trust and resig- nation," feelings not dissimilar to a Spinozistic "equanimity." In Spinoza's semantic and philosophical revolution, there truly is a "Divine Will," but one, of course, far removed from its original ac- ceptation. Janet and Tryan ever more closely commune; Tryan having a "new yearning for. . . pure human joys" which Janet can provide, and Tryan representing for Janet "repose from that conflict of emotion, with trust in the unchangeable, with an influx of a power to subdue self." The "heaven-sent" Tryan had "loosed her bonds" of subservience to the passions, and helped her achieve an equa- nimity that is characteristic of a person moved by the adequate ideas of the second and third kinds of knowledge. It is natural that Janet should be tending to Mr. Tryan in his last illness: God's will, which is simply the "train of events" (409) leading up to his ill- ness, dictates that Janet should have this honor. And as Mr. Tryan lies "calmly conscious of the reality" of death, he tells Janet that now that she has "a sure trust in God," he can be released from his temporal existence. They then share "a sacred kiss of promise" (410), which is not intended to suggest that they will physically meet again in some transcendent realm, but that insofar as Mr. Tryan has achieved the "blessed" state of the third kind of knowl- edge, and gained an intellectual love of God,24 he will be "saved" in a sense which has resonances beyond the metaphorical and rhetori- cal use of the term. Mr. Tryan's state of "blessedness" is nothing less than the Spinozistic ideal of secular salvation, one related to the third kind of knowledge, where one sees the world under the aspect of eter- nity, achieving a limited emancipation from the bondage of finitude. This Spinozistic "eternity," while far removed from theistic no- tions of "immortality" and the everlasting soul, nonetheless re- veals a metaphysical dimension to Spinoza's thought. Spinoza de- scribes this semi-religious and esoteric doctrine in Part V of the Ethics , where he explains: that death is less hurtful in proportion as the mind pos- sesses clear and distinct knowledge, and consequently in proportion as it loves God. Further, since (by prop. 27, 44</page><page sequence="14">Part V) from the third kind of cognition arises the highest possible repose of mind, it follows that the human mind can be of such a nature that that portion of which we have shown to perish with the body (see prop. 21, Part V) is of no moment compared with what remains of it.25 NOTES 1 The George Eliot Letters , ed.

Thomas Deegan points out that the full extent of the intellectual partnership between Lewes and Eliot has been underestimated.

God is free in the sense that he is "self- 46</page><page sequence="16">creating," and entirely unaffected by external forces; whatever happens is simply an unfolding of God's essence. God is not "free" in the sense of His choosing one action over another: "Thus all things are determined by the necessity of the divine nature, not only to exist, but also to exist and act in a certain manner, and there is nothing contingent; q.e.d." ( Ethics , Pt. I, Prop. XXIX). 19Spinoza insists that to be free is not to be undetermined, be- cause that concept involves a contradiction. Rather, to be free is to be se/f-determined ( Ethics , Pt. I, Def. 7). In a sense, only God can be completely free, but a limited form of freedom is made pos- sible for some human beings through Spinoza's concept of the cona - tus, which he uses to explain purposive activity. The conatus is any given individual's endeavor to persist in his own being; that is, to resist, as far as possible, external causes to which we are all to some extent in bondage. A human being can be "free" insofar as his conatus manifests itself and masters the "passions," which is the name Spinoza gives these external forces or modes ( Ethics , Pt. IV, Appendix §32). This freedom is only relative - only God is com- pletely self-determined - but freedom worthy of the name is possi- ble, and even a form of alternative salvation, made possible to those rare few who can enter the esoteric realm of the third kind of knowledge. 20Knoepflmacher, George Eliot's Eariy Novels , 72. 2lLetters, II, 347. nEthics, Pt.
