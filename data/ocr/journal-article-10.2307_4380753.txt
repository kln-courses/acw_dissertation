<plain_text><page sequence="1">1 cu5 0L Gunnar Asplund's upper promenade for Stockholm's Skandia Theater The Architecture of Gunnar Asplund June 30-September 10, Goodwin Galleries, 2nd floor Erik Gunnar Asplund (1885- 1940) was Sweden's leading architect in the years between the two world wars. Though his work has had an important influence on a small group of today's lead- ing architects and theorists, As- plund has remained largely un- known to a wider postwar gener- ation of architects. The exhibition, which will employ a combination of photo and text panels, is guest directed by Stuart Wrede, an American-educated Finnish archi- tect. In the accompanying text to the exhibition and in a book to be published next winter by MIT Press, Mr. Wrede provides an im- portant and long overdue analysis and reassessment of Asplund's remarkable oeuvre. By the early 1920s, Asplund had emerged as the most innova- tive practitioner of "new clas- sicism," a Scandinavian-wide movement. His conversion to the International Style led to his much-admired buildings for the Stockholm Exhibition of 1930. However, having embraced func- tionalism, Asplund was one of the first architects to react against it. As early as 1935 he began to re- integrate modern architecture with classical, vernacular, and archaic sources, and it is this combination of interests that makes Asplund's work so fas- cinating today. Asplund was a deeply psycho- logical architect, conjuring up memories, moods, and emotions through the use of highly evoca- tive forms, among them the time- less solemnity of his Woodland Crematorium and the transient gaiety of much of the Stockholm Exhibition. In addition to their formal rigor, most of Asplund's major buildings also function on a symbolic level, continuing the 19th-century concern with signifi- cance often via subtly articulated anthropomorphic metaphors. There is a clear continuity of motifs and themes that initially grew out of the medieval-classical duality, but gradually evolved toward a more cosmic duality of man and nature, male and female, and finally, life and death. In his In Memorium for As- plund, published in 1940, Alvar Aalto wrote: "Sweden, but above all architecture, has suffered a great loss-the first among archi- tects, who has been both a pioneer and pathfinder for his own era's living architecture, has left us." Aalto concluded his comments with this perceptive appraisal: "Another architecture has ar- rived which builds for man and essentially regards people as a social group phenomenon, at the same time as science and research are employed as the point of de- parture. But beyond that a newer architecture has made its appear- ance which continues to utilize the tools of the social sciences, but also includes the study of psycho- logical problems-'the unknown human' in his totality. The latter has proved that the art of archi- tecture continues to have inex- haustible resources and means which pour directly out of nature and the inexplicable reactions of human emotions. Within this lat- ter architecture, Asplund has his given position." 0</page></plain_text>
