<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> version as an object of interest on its own terms. In doing so, Peebles offers  fascinating insights about the production process entailed in the making of  various McCarthy films. In the case of All the Pretty Horses, for instance,  she explains what could not be fully translated, both in terms of John  Grady’s desires for a different world and in terms of how Billy Bob  Thornton envisioned bringing his version of the story to the screen. The  Coen brothers faced fewer problems with adaptation, largely because of the  text they were given. Peebles recounts a story the directors have shared  concerning how they wrote their script: “[One of them held the book open  while the other typed into the computer” (qtd. in Peebles 167). Ultimately  Peebles’ essay is less a tale about what is lost in the process of  transforming novels into films and more about the specific and always  unique constraints facing any scriptwriter or filmmaker who is engaged in  adapting a particular piece of literature for the screen.  Finally, John Dudley’s piece addresses the problems of masculinity  and heroism in McCarthy’s writings. His essay builds on previous critics  who note how Julia Krivesta’s theories of abjection help explains  McCarthy’s writings. Dudley extends these observations in making sense  of the texts’ gender dynamics, particularly how a feminine threat often  operates in McCarthy’s Western novels. In doing so, Dudley examines  scholarship that reads the popular Western as a larger tale about gender  struggle and the feminizing powers of a hyper-modernizing America, a  problem that continually confounds McCarthy’s male characters who  typically seek escape in dangerous and rugged landscapes.   Ultimately, Frye’s collection brings together a wide-ranging group of  essays that offer diverse critical perspectives on McCarthy’s vast body of  writing. The contributors write out of various theoretical traditions, relying  on elements of language theory and western philosophy, developing  insights from gender studies and environmental criticism, and employing  genre theory and film studies. A well-balanced collection, Frye’s edition  offers good coverage of the author’s writings and adds important new  insights into the many literary, cultural, and cinematic achievements of  Cormac McCarthy.     ********  Estes, Andrew Keller. Cormac McCarthy and the Writing of  American Spaces. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2013. 239 pp.  Paperback. $70. ISBN 9789042036291.  Review by O. Alan Noble    An drew Keller Estes’ new book reveals the usefulness of environmental criticism for reading Cormac McCarthy’s novels. His central argument is that McCarthy’s later works  present a dialectic vision of nature as either utopian or dystopian without  privileging either vision. A synthesis of these perspectives comes out  99  Cormac McCarthy Journal 2014  </page> <page sequence="2"> occasionally: “some of McCarthy’s texts hint at a new way forward, an  escape from traditional ways of conceiving space and a better approach to  environment” (16). Estes describes this as a “biocentric” map: “an  egalitarian view of nature in which all members of the ecosphere have  intrinsic rights” (41). As an introduction to trends in environmental  criticism and their applications to contemporary literature, Estes’ book is  insightful. His application of this criticism to McCarthy’s novels varies in  effectiveness. Interpreting the voices in the novels within the framework of  environmental criticism generally is helpful for situating McCarthy in the  larger movement of modernity and its relationship to environments. The  most daring claim of the book, that McCarthy offers a “new way forward,”  is regrettably less persuasive than it could be. Despite this deficiency, Estes  has contributed a notable addition to McCarthy scholarship. His book will  be an essential text for any scholars who wish to consider McCarthy and  environmental criticism.   Estes begins by presenting providing some theoretical context for  environmental criticism and the American tradition of writing about nature,  and then presents a survey of McCarthy scholarship. For readers who are  new to this movement, the chapter on environmental criticism chapter will  be particularly helpful. Estes lays out a brief survey of the important  literature surrounding the major binaries that define environmental  criticism (space/place, nature/culture, wilderness/civilization, etc.) and then  connects that terminology to McCarthy’s later works. In his second  chapter, Estes gives a rich survey of the tradition in American literature of  writing nature either in strongly positive or strongly negative terms. Estes  traces each of these trends through American history, from the Edenic  vision of Columbus and the demonic vision of Vespucci through the the  utopian perspectives of Crévecoeur, Jefferson, and Emerson. Finally, Estes  surveys McCarthy scholarship in general and choses three articles to focus  on that pertain more closely to his thesis. Much of this survey feels  extraneous to his argument. Of note is his treatment of John Cant’s article  on The Road included in Bloom’s Modern Critical Views: Cormac  McCarthy. Disappointingly, Estes chides Cant’s reading of the “roadmap”  as a metaphor for McCarthy’s “literary past” (96). Estes objects because  Cant “fails to point out that it is an oil company roadmap, something which  implies a very specific view of nature” (96). It is unclear why Estes expects  Cant to perform the same ecocritical reading of McCarthy as himself.  Overall the theoretical half of Cormac McCarthy and the Writing of  American Spaces is insightful, although the reader may wish he had opted  to devote more space to his close readings.  Estes starts his close reading with Blood Meridian, asserting that the  novel interrogates and unsettles several binaries. An example of this is the  collapse of the wilderness/civilization distinction in the scalp hunters (114).  Estes reads the environments as largely reflecting the negative view of  nature in American literature. Seemingly in line with this evil world, Estes  interprets the judge as a caricature of the enlightenment belief that the earth  100  Cormac McCarthy Journal 2014  </page> <page sequence="3"> is a wilderness that we must subdue and enslave. The judge’s view of  nature is challenged by the consequences of western expansion and the  slaughter of the American buffalo. By showing the destructive, logical  conclusion to “mastering nature” Blood Meridian encourages readers to  rethink their relationship with nature, according to Estes. In the famous  “optical democracy” passage of Blood Meridian, Estes finds the first  example of a “biocentric” “new way forward.” McCarthy describes a  setting in which humans cease to be the focal point of existence and all  being is equally significant, and Estes calls this passage a “way out” of the  utopian and dystopian perspectives on nature: “McCarthy thus suggests a  rethinking of our relationship with the natural world” (131-132). However,  it is not clear why readers should interpret this passage as a “rethinking” or  a “way out,” which implies some kind of progress. It is true that this  passage is unique in the novel, but in what sense is it privileged by the  text? Without explaining why this passage should be seen as prominent,  Estes gives the impression that it is the “new way forward” because it fits  nicely with his concept of biocentrism.  The chapter on All the Pretty Horses is refreshingly insightful. The  basic structure of the chapter is obvious: John Grady and Lacey move from  an idealistic view of pure nature (Mexico) to a pessimistic view as a part of  their maturing. What makes the chapter so interesting is the way Estes uses  his close reading to draw this theme together. One example of this is his  observation that John Grady’s view of the wilderness as symbolized in  horses is reflected in two images of horses in the novel: an idyllic picture  of horses hanging on his grandfather’s wall in Texas and a realistic image  on a tapestry in Mexico on the wall of his lover’s aunt.   In his chapter on The Crossing, Estes discusses how McCarthy’s  characters deal with the close of the American West by imagining Mexico  as “an ersatz frontier” for them to explore (159). His environmental  reading of the wolf, the Trinity Test, and the modernizing world of the  novel are all compelling. The efforts to trap the wolf represent negative and  abusive views of nature as raw material for humans to enslave, an idea that  finds its ultimate symbol in the Trinity Test, the harnessing of the raw  materials of nature in order to destroy nature. The weakness of the chapter  is his discussion of the “new way forward,” which he finds not in The  Crossing so much as in Cities of the Plain. In the final text of the Border  Trilogy, Billy allows a woman to look at his old hands, and she sees in  them “map enough for men to read. There’s God’s plenty of signs and  wonders to make a landscape. To make a world” (291). From this passage,  Estes draws the conclusion that it is a biocentric way of viewing the world,  one that promotes equality, dynamism, and our interconnectedness (172). It  is never clear how he gets from the description of Billy’s hand to these  biocentric virtues. Where is equality in this scene, or the dynamism, or  interconnectedness?   In his seventh chapter, Estes argues that No Country for Old Men  involves a failure to live ethically in a “country.” Estes defines “country”  101  Cormac McCarthy Journal 2014  </page> <page sequence="4"> as a set of ethical obligations humans have with each other and the  environment, and understood this way, it is not hard to see how No Country  for Old Men is about the loss of such contracts and the chaos it produces.  This conception of country as an ethos seems like a potentially helpful  reading of the novel and it warrants further research.  In The Road, Estes finds utopic and dystopic nature and a rich  example of a biocentric map. In a brief section, Estes considers the broader  context of apocalypse in American literature and environmental criticism.  Estes also notes the way the novel uses natural/manmade and good/evil as  important binaries that the text ultimately deconstructs. When Estes claims  that “at first” the good/evil binary is a “tidy and self-sufficient categor[y],”  he seems to be reading the father’s words through the son. From the  beginning of the novel it is very clear that the good guys/bad guys binary is  either completely arbitrary or uncertain. Consider the early scene of the  father wandering in the darkness, seeking moral rectitude and asking  himself “Upright to what?” (15) At first, the novel questions the possibility  of moral uprightness in a destroyed world; however, by the novel’s  conclusion goodness is not merely a hypothetical abstraction which has  gone out with the rest of culture. The father proclaims that “Goodness will  find the little boy. It always has. It will again,” and shockingly, it does, in  the form of the parka-man (281). If anything, The Road charts a movement  from moral uncertainty to faith in a certain moral good. Despite these  objections, I found this chapter to be valuable, particularly because of the  final few sections, where Estes gives readers the historical context of the  novel’s reference to Rock City and interprets the final paragraph as a  “biocentric map.” Estes explains the history of Rock City as a natural space  that became famous for appearing like a human creation. This  anthropomorphism is part of the “inability to see [our] intertwinedness with  nature” which The Road criticizes (212). The most convincing part of this  chapter’s close reading is his interpretation of the “brook trout” paragraph,  which is certainly the clearest articulation of a “biocentric map” in  McCarthy’s oeuvre.   As this field of criticism grows, I hope we will have scholars building  on the foundation laid in Cormac McCarthy and the Writing of American  Spaces. Estes’ historicist work on McCarthy’s use of oil company maps  and Rock City will make this work important for scholars and readers. At  times the book suffers from its origins as a dissertation—over-explaining  the organization, repetitions, and strained connections—but on the whole,  Estes’ use of environmental criticism to read McCarthy is a valuable  contribution.      102  Cormac McCarthy Journal 2014  </page> </plain_text>
