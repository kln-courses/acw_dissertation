<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUMANIST ANTIFORMALISM AS A THEOPOLITICS OF RACE: E H. JACOBI ON FRIEND AND ENEMY Jeffrey S. Librett there arose in his soul the plan for a work which...would display...humanity as it is.1 INTRODUCTION In the following, I retrace the close connections among humanism, antiformalism, and stereotypical representations of religiocultural and racial identity in the German Counterenlightenment thinker, F. H. Jacobi. The critical reconstruc- tion of this moment in the history of "humanity" is of some importance, because in a number of recent contributions to the historiography of modern German philosophy, an always laudable attitude of suspicion with respect to the claims of Enlightenment reason has given rise to an inadequate-because excessively credulous-reading of Counterenlightenment faith, and especially of Jacobi. This sympathetic reading has been insufficiently attentive to the metaphysical and cultural-political difficulties that I examine here, and which remain inseparable from the eighteenth-century German irrationalist vision of a community of friends rooted in a spiritual humanity beyond all restrictive, material forms.2 Jacobi's problematic contribution to the polemics around the definition of the human between the Enlightenment and Romanticism can best be JEFFREY S.

The German Enlighteners make a concerted effort to characterize the essence of the human in terms of rational freedom. Since the most prominent Enlighteners, especially Lessing, Kant, and Mendelssohn, see clearly that rationality places certain formal limits on total freedom (in the sense of anarchic disorder) and that conversely freedom in its purest state would necessarily burst the bounds of rea- son, one can assume that they are well aware of the significant internal tension inher- ent in the notion of free rationality or law-governed freedom. Nonetheless, from their perspective this tension cannot be renounced because anarchy appears not as freedom but as heteronomy (as enslavement to the laws of contingent nature), while reason without freedom is irrationality itself, insofar as domination makes self-determined transparency impossible. For the Enlighteners, in one way or another, the internal self-harmonization of free rationality is the infinite project of a humanity in the pro- cess of becoming. The German Counterenlightenment-of which Jacobi is perhaps the most extreme representative-vigorously contests this conception of humanity, rejecting the notion that rationality is necessary for, and ultimately in harmony with, radical freedom. Instead, the opponents of Enlightenment insist that irrationality-as faith, cultural particularity, and/or imaginative-affective excess-is the very touch- stone of the freedom of the will, which for them becomes the distinguishing trait of the human essence.3 Jacobi's entire project, as I retrace it here, attempts to present a version of this position. Although Jacobi argues for irrational freedom as the essence of the human, he by no means sees himself as participating in a merely intellectual or theo- retical discussion. Rather, he is trying to wage discursive warfare. Jacobi explicitly attempts, in making this argument, to distinguish between the absolute friend and the absolute enemy of mankind (as of God), the absolute friend and the absolute enemy as such. In Jacobi's discourse, if humanity consists in irrational freedom, then only the friend of such freedom is the friend as such; the enemy of this freedom, the enemy of humanity, is the enemy tout court.4 But the absolute enemy does not merely set limits to freedom. Be- yond this, he situates himself on the limit between the establishment of such limits and their suspension or denial. For the open enemy of freedom is, from Jacobi's point of view, relatively unthreatening and easy to contest: this enemy cannot secretly infil- trate the space of the friends of humanity. Similarly, the merely nonhuman, insofar as it keeps its distance, is a potentially friendly opponent, since it gives definition to "the human." In contrast, the most treacherous, most inimical enemy is the "human" be- ing who both-apparently-affirms freedom and tacitly denies it by subjecting it to rational constraints. This truly absolute and indeed satanically monstrous enemy of humanity is the one who occupies and undermines the border between humanity and nonhumanity, turning each into the other just where they are supposed to part ways. Jacobi's defense against the confusion of human freedom with its limits takes two principal forms, each of which we will consider below. He begins, as an opponent of the Enlightenment, by attacking indiscriminately reason (Vernunft) 234</page><page sequence="3">LIBRETT / Humanist Antiformalism and understanding (Verstand) as a single counterhuman force, while defending faith in revelation as fundamentally human because radically free. He ends, apparently at the opposite extreme, by defending reason against what he takes to be the mere-and less than human-understanding, which is operative not only in Enlightenment but also in Romanticism and Idealism. Yet reason, in Jacobi's last writings, is the faculty of human faith. Moreover, in his late work, as in his earlier critique of Enlightenment, the defense of faith subserves a defense of spiritual content-the free human essence- against material form. Wherever, as with Jacobi, all content is regarded as spiritual, and spirituality is in turn identified with substantiality and personality, material form, which encompasses the world of appearances and everything in the domain of "thought," must function as something like a countersubstance and antipersonal force.s It appears to annihilate content if the latter is understood in terms of spirit, for it makes content dependent on something else, something "inert," and thus cancels ab- solute independence, without which there could be no "real" substantiality or person- ality. Material form, which in general terms is identical with "the letter," is form as an (anti)absolute, form that tendentially absorbs all content or subject "matter" into its own insubstantial and intentionless opacity. Because material form functions in this way, Jacobi strenuously opposes it everywhere, which means that he opposes every- thing that would be identifiable as something in particular. However, Jacobi's project will always be harassed by its own im- possibility, which one can formalize (displeasing though this would have been to Jacobi) as follows. If the essence, or ideal content, of humanity is absolute freedom, then-by an apparent paradox-humanity has no essence because it refuses to be limited in any way. But if humanity has no essence, no ideal or spiritual content, then it consists in nothing but the play of material forms. Since material forms, moreover, comprise mere negations or limitations, absolute human freedom entails or implies absolute human bondage, necessity, or nonhumanity. In turn, however, if humanity reduces to the play of material forms, then it has no essence whatsoever, no self to repress, no limitation: humanity appears, once again, to be absolutely free, and so the cycle be- gins anew. Jacobi's oeuvre "essentially" consists in the attempt to interrupt this aporetic identity between human freedom and its intimate enemy, material form.6 DEHUMANIZING REASON: MATERIAL FORM IN RHETORICAL, THEOPOLITICAL, AND RACIAL TERMS Jacobi's polemic against the Enlightenment is concentrated in the documents of the debate he provokes in the 1780s with the aged and ailing Moses Mendelssohn. In these documents, Jacobi attempts to illustrate his view that Enlight- enment necessarily culminates in atheism and fatalism through the example of Lessing who, as Jacobi alleges and boasts, has confessed the secret of his lifelong Spinozism (i.e., for Jacobi, atheistic fatalism in its purest distillation) to his good "friend" Jacobi shortly before dying in 1781.7 Throughout the debate, Jacobi struggles with the ten- sion between free will and rationality, or humanity and material form, by attempting to represent reason and free will as two completely distinct entities which are not in any way mutually (de)constitutive. Indeed, Jacobi wants to represent reason as abso- lutely other than-but also a secondary and negative version of, or a guilty lapse 235</page><page sequence="4">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 / 2 from-the will, which plays the role of limitless, positive, ideal content. The reverse, of course, is not to be the case: the will is not to be in any sense derived from reason. Thus, for Jacobi, the will, which comes to man from God, must choose God in order to return to itself. Properly exercised, will is faith. If the will chooses reason rather than God, limitation to specific forms rather than the ideal content of the unlimited, then it chooses-faithlessly-against itself and falls into alienation, into the incapac- ity to know and be what it truly is.8 Jacobi manages to render reason secondary, negative, and other with respect to the freedom of the will by identifying reason, strangely enough, with sensu- ality, and he can do this because he draws on an age-old hierarchical polarity: the understanding is to will, or reason is to faith, as rhetoric is to philosophy. The under- standing or intellect provides a mere figural, improper expression for the literal, proper, and immediate certainty of faith. The former is a mere similitude of the latter result- ing from an act of comparison: How can we strive for certainty [Gewifheit] unless we are already acquainted with certainty in advance, and how can we be acquainted with it except through something that we already discern with cer- tainty? This leads to the concept of an immediate certainty [unmittelbaren Gewifheit], which not only needs no proof, but ex- cludes all proofs absolutely, and is...the representation itself agreeing with the thing being represented [die mit dem vorgestellten Dinge iiber einstimmende Vorstellung selbst]. Conviction by proofs is cer- tainty at second hand. Proofs are only indications of similarity [Ahnlichkeit] to a thing of which we are certain. The conviction [Ueberzeugung] that they generate originates in comparison [Vergleichung], and can never be quite secure and perfect. But if ev- ery assent to truth [Fiirwahrhalten] not derived from rational grounds is faith [Glaube], then conviction based on rational grounds must itself derive from faith, and must receive its force from faith alone. (230) If reason is rhetoric as figure of comparison, or imperfect and belated metaphor, then faith, which, despite Jacobi, one might call the rhetorical dimension of persuasion or performative power, is evidently more like reason or philosophy than philosophical reason itself. Through this figure of chiasmic reversal, Jacobi attempts to reinstall religion on the throne of spirit. But within the chiasmus itself, there must be something that makes Jacobi pass beyond the delegitimation of reason-the notion that reason is merely based on unreasonable faith-to the rehabilitation of faith as more reasonable, hence more securely grounded, than reason itself. What element makes it possible for mere opinion to appear as true faith? What guarantees the true immediacy of the appar- ently immediate? The answer is twofold. First, Jacobi's guarantee is simply faith itself, or more specifically, faith in the Lutheran version of revelation: faith in faith alone as the will to the will. Second, Lutheran faith is supported in Jacobi's discourse by cer- tain religiocultural and racist stereotypes that register anxiety about non-Protestant and even non-European "others" with whom the Enlightenment version of rational 236</page><page sequence="5">LIBRETT / Humanist Antiformalism humanism threatens to bring into the vicinity of Europe. The ethnic-racial foreignness of what is metonymically adjacent to Protestant Europe here functions as an overdetermining analogy for the otherness of form with respect to essential content or meaning, the intimate foreignness of the limit to what it delimits. Faith and its object come to seem all the more positive, the more the negativity of rational form is associ- ated with the negative characteristics of certain socially excluded populations, the "enemies" of (white, Lutheran) "humanity." In Jacobi's humanism, these ethnic- racial "enemies" are principally Jews, Catholics, and blacks. To begin with the Jews: for Lutheran Protestantism, everything that is not the living faith is mere works, the dead letter of the formalist law and the works it prescribes-Judaism. Taking this literally, Jacobi suggests that all discourse that does not conform to "my" faithful will is Judaic. It follows that Enlightenment reason is Jewish. Thus, for Jacobi, the rationalist anthropology of the Enlightenment cuts off all access to the freedom of humanity not because of the inherently aporetic character of the affirmation of the human essence as freedom-which remains unavowable- but because reason, as distinct from faith, speaks the language of the Jews. First of all, there are at least two major elements of Jacobi's strategy that bluntly link Enlighten- ment to Judaism. Spinoza functions, despite and even because of his excommunica- tion by the Jewish community of Amsterdam in 1656, as the figure of the faithless Jew. And it is, of course, by no means a matter of chance that Jacobi chooses precisely Moses Mendelssohn's friendship with Lessing as the point of his attack on the faith- lessness of Enlightenment. Furthermore, Jacobi himself draws these connections ex- plicitly within the texts of the Spinoza-debate in numerous passages of which it will suffice to cite the following: A specter of [Spinoza's system] has been making the rounds in Ger- many for quite some time under all sorts of shapes, and it is treated by both the superstitious and the infidel with equal reverence.... Perhaps we shall live to see a battle over the corpse of Spinoza, just like the one between the Archangel and Satan over the corpse of Moses. (232-33) Here, Jacobi conflates the corpus of Spinoza, the bad Jew whose thought epitomizes Enlightenment, with the corpse of Moses, the law as rotting carcass, and he does this while addressing himself in polemic to Moses himself-Moses Mendelssohn. He thereby says to Mendelssohn: reason is the letter, the Jew as the dead body of language.9 You, reason, are the Jew as death itself.'0 But rational discourse is not only separated from faith by being connected with the name of Spinoza and understood as an instance of the direct re- turn of the repressed dead letter of the Jews. Furthermore, it appears on a number of occasions as Catholic, that is, from a Lutheran perspective, as an indirect return of the Jewish letter (as "Church") within its Christian repression.1' Jacobi writes, for ex- ample, that his enemies will reveal themselves through their excessive writing to be spinning the plot or web of "hyper-crypto-Jesuitism and philosophical Popism" (349).12 The cryptic character of these Jesuits links them, of course, to the crypto-Judaism of the Marranos. For Jacobi to put the Enlighteners in the position of the Marranos is 237</page><page sequence="6">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 / 2 unfortunately for him to put himself in the position of the Spanish Inquisition, a place in which he would much prefer not to be. The fact that he finds himself there-as an effect of the aporia sketched at the outset-makes it all the more necessary for him to distinguish his discourse definitively from that of his opponent. Toward the conclu- sion of his last direct contribution to the Spinoza-debate with Mendelssohn, Against Mendelssohn's Accusations in his Letter to the Friends of Lessing, Jacobi has to go further than he has ever gone and associate the Enlighteners with black Africans as figures for the unquestionably alien. The darkness that Enlightenment, for Jacobi, imposes-the dark- ness of the letter of Judaeo-Catholic provenience, the darkness of the body of lan- guage, always marked by time and death-now takes on racially "black" and at the same time theologically pagan connotations. If the Enlightener is a Jewish Catholic, this is evidently because he is a pagan black man: Let us suppose the following case: an anatomist [Zergliederer, also "dismemberer"] investigated the negro [Neger], in accordance with Sommering, and gave a report of what he had found that was, to be sure, utterly crooked and empty [queer und leer], but so constructed that the result was this: the negro is not unlike [nicht ungleich] the European, indeed, on the whole, even above him. And now let us further suppose that the administrators of the divine reason of man came along and praised the wisdom, the piety, and the philosophical and moral achievement of this operation, looking with sidelong glances at Sommering's evil character and his reckless enthusiasm for his art, and how one ought for the sake of one's good conscience to dispar- age him, and by a higher right ought to claim that he is wrong: would we not all laugh and become angry? And yet we neither laugh nor become angry when the very same thing happens with respect to other important matters of human knowledge, indeed to the most impor- tant. We look on calmly, yea with approval, as facts, history, and the most binding inferences and most obvious results are trodden under foot, in accordance with a certain mad obsession with the useful, and by means of a more than Popish infallibility, whose despotism and pious enthusiasm raises itself to the level of a Grand Inquisitor's care of the soul. (360-61)13 Jacobi here prophecies, so to speak, the late-nineteenth-century programmatic racism for which he is helping to lay the groundwork.14 Because "we" all "know" that "we" would "laugh and become angry" if "we" were ever confused with "negroes," Jacobi compares the Enlighteners with-Inquisitorial-"anatomists" or "dismemberers" who would compare the body of the "negro" with the body of the "European" and find no difference, or even place the black "above" the white. The Enlighteners-quasi-Judaeo- Catholic defenders of mechanical thinking-are like pagan blacks-the ultimate en- emy, or nature as difference and death-because they choose to think they are like blacks and because they would have "us" believe that "we" are no different from, or even a little bit below, blacks. Reason is a Judaeo-Catholic, Afro-pagan product. God is not dead, it seems, as long as "we" still believe in race. The Geschlecht (race, spe- cies, sex) of the Enlighteners-a Geschlecht of "fanatics" and "fantasts," according to Jacobi, when they are called by their "proper names" (359)-turns out to be a 238</page><page sequence="7">LIBRETT / Humanist Antiformalism "race," and not merely a "family," but not a properly European race. Indeed, this "race" is not part of the human "race" at all: One who does not...have an awareness of his faculty to will...is some- thing other than a human being, and it is impossible to decide any- thing about his essence [wer sein Vermogen zu wollen nicht empfindet...ist etwas anders als ein Mensch, und man kann iiber sein Wesen nichts entscheiden]. (209-10) Jacobi casts the one who acknowledges reason (and the doubts it casts on freedom) beyond the limits of humanity, branding him or her as the absolute enemy. But even worse than those who would flatly deny freedom and thereby openly exile themselves from humanity, such as avowed atheists, the current followers of the Enlightenment's rational theology, after the fashion of Spinoza, deny freedom for the sake of reason, and yet they continue to speak in the name of free- dom. On the border between the human and the inhuman, these people are the worst of all-the most inhuman-because they blur the border without the clarity of which all (humanity) is lost. Thus, for example, in Against Mendelssohn's Accusations, Jacobi complains that all around him, in the period immediately following Mendelssohn's death, the enemies are rendering indistinct the border between themselves and Jacobi's friends. The potential friends, who are fast turning into real enemies, characterize the ultra-inhuman (because half-human) enemy, embodied in this case by Mendelssohn, as a friend, indeed as the friend of man:15 Even those who attacked Mendelssohnfs philosophy from all sides, including its wrong-minded Spinozism, praised nonetheless this very wrong-mindedness as an act of decency, a sign that Mendelssohn was a very friend of man [lobten dennoch dieses Misstun selbst, das Anstindige und Menschenfreundliche der Handlung]. (331-32) As a result of this painful misidentification of the enemy of man as a friend of man, the misguided ones miscast the friend-Jacobi himself-as an enemy: "At the same time, all of the ceremonies of his Socratization and divinization were imitatively re- peated" (332).16 As the one of whom it was alleged at the time (by Karl Philip Moritz, among others) that he had killed the aged Mendelssohn when he provoked him to a discursive duel over the question of Lessing's Spinozism, Jacobi is placed by these "ceremonies" in the position of the evil Greek State that has put the good Socrates to death. Furthermore, Jacobi finds the (Christ-killing) Jew in the position he himself wishes to occupy-as Christian Socrates or Socratic Christ-while he himself occu- pies the position of the Christ-killing Jew. And finally, when the Enlightenment enemy calls the enemy a friend of the friend, this is tantamount to calling Satan the "friend" of God, and so worse even than siding with Satan against God. The Enlighteners debase "the spirit...to excrement": as long as they only want to decorate the darkness with the light and, instead of exterminating Satan, only want to persuade him to estab- lish an amicable accord with-or move him to become friends with [ihn befreunden wollen]-the divinity, I hate them more than I hate the atheist himself. (344) 239</page><page sequence="8">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 / 2 Those who want to assimilate inhuman reason to human will are the ultimate enemy, insofar as they undermine the categories of friend and enemy entirely. And not only in theory, but in fact. In this last direct contribution to the Spinoza-debate with Mendelssohn, Jacobi twice lapses into a surprising identifi- cation with Spinoza himself, who everywhere else in Jacobi's text is the exemplary figure of the enemy, the one responsible for the effacement of the distinction between enemy and friend. First, when introducing a quotation from the work of his friend, Hemsterhuis, Jacobi writes that he would be happy to be subject to "excommunica- tion" (das Verbannungsurtheil) (353) from the official philosophical discourse, as long as he could depart hand in hand with his friend. Second, he makes this identifica- tion a bit more explicit when referring to another friend (Hamann, this time) as a man "in whose society I would be happy to be banned from every philosophical syna- gogue" (355-56). Of course, insofar as Jacobi sees the Enlightenment as quasi-Jewish, it makes sense for him to see himself as being expelled, like Benedict Spinoza qua Christ-figure, from its discourse. But given that the quasi-Jewish character of Enlight- enment is best demonstrated according to Jacobi by its reducibility to the thought of Baruch Spinoza, Jacobi's identification here is self-contradictory or capitulatory. It constitutes an identification with the enemy as the one who makes it necessary to identify oneself with the enemy. Jacobi's incapacity to separate his discourse of irra- tional freedom from the discourse of his rational enemies-to separate human free- dom from rational form-will gradually prompt him to alter the strategy of his antiformalist defense of the "human" so as to claim to speak in the name of "reason" itself. HUMANS, ANIMALS, AND THE SATANIC MONSTERS IN BETWEEN: JACOBI'S LATE DEFENSE OF "REASON" At the outset of the "Preface and also Introduction to the Author's Collected Philosophical Works," which precedes the 1815 republication of David Hume on Faith, or Idealism and Realism, a Dialogue (originally published in 1787 as the first major text after Against Mendelssohn's Accusations), Jacobi attempts to cor- rect his earlier philosophical position by introducing a new distinction between rea- son and the faculty of understanding, a distinction of which he claims he has only gradually and slowly become aware. Reason is now the (good) substantial faculty of faith, while the understanding is the (bad) formalist faculty of Enlightenment-and, perhaps surprisingly, Romantic-raisonnement. In terms of the politics of discourse in Jacobi's context, the main rhetorical function of this distinction is to adapt his discourse to its current situation: in 1815, Jacobi's enemy is no longer the Enlightenment but, rather, the currently domi- nant generation of the Romantics, such as Friedrich Schlegel, and the Idealist philoso- phers, above all Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, whose works continue to appear from the early 1790s. In the face of the current generation, the Sturm und Drang rhetoric of radical antirationality would no longer be particularly effective or meaningful. The generation of 1815 has absorbed such large doses of historicity and incorporated them into its conception of reason that Jacobi is forced to adopt a new strategy. By 240</page><page sequence="9">LIBRETT / Humanist Antiformalism arguing for faith under the slogan of reason, and so arguing for the unity of reason and faith, he hopes to ingratiate himself with the members of the Romantic-Idealist generation and to lead them away from what appear to him as their mechanically cerebral formalist, on the one hand, and their flirtations with the godless chaos of nature, on the other.17 More important than Jacobi's essentially cosmetic shift in the direction of reason along with its locally strategic motivations, however, is the unbro- ken continuity, across his career, of his attempt to combat the materiality of form in the name of free humanity, and indeed the increasing prominence of the humanist motif. In the late work, Jacobi tries to improve and solidify his earlier determination of the "human" by means of the distinction between reason and understanding as one between the human and animal essences. Predictably, Jacobi defines the distinction between human and animal, which comes down to the distinction between reason and mere understanding, in terms of the difference between supersensuous and sensu- ous: "The animal lacks the organ for the awareness of the supersensible, and because of this lack the concept of a merely animal reason is an impossible one. Man possesses the organ, and it is only with it and through it that he is a rational being" (540). Furthermore, reason is not a faculty of mere "reflection resting on sense experience alone" (540) but, rather, a "truly revelatory" function, exactly what "the author" previously "expounded under the title 'power of faith'" (541). Reason is a higher "faculty of perception" (Wahrnehmungsvermogen) of the supersensuous, a faculty of "rational intuitions" (Vernunftsanschauungen) (563), not a mere "faculty of reflexion" (Reflexionsvermagen) (541). It is a "faculty of feelings" (564), and these feelings are as supersensuous as the intuitions of sense are objectively sensuous. Reason, finally, is a matter of the "essence" (Wesen) rather than the "word" (Wort) (541). In contrast, the faculty of understanding is not only bound to materiality or sensuality but also, not surprisingly, to mere form, while reason is linked to the supersensuous as content: Like any other system of cognitions, philosophy too obtains its form from the understanding alone, as the faculty of concepts in general....The content of philosophy, what belongs just to it, is given to it by reason alone which is "the faculty of cognition independent of sensibility, beyond its reach." Reason...simply reveals. (562) The dehumanization of the understanding here occurs in the service of the exclusion from humanity of both matter and form-and thus every "informed" matter, every- thing that is identifiable and recognizable as an object or a thought. The exclusion from humanity of material form in 1815 seems-but only seems-to be separate from, and to take precedence over, the exclusion from humanity of non-white, non-Protestant races and cultures that we saw at work in Jacobi's texts of the 1780s: man is elevated above what is animal simply and solely by the prop- erty of reason. If we abstract from this property (which distinguishes the genus "man" essentially from the genus "animal," and pertains absolutely and exclusively to man), then what is so often claimed would be perfectly correct, namely that the difference between an orangutan and a native of California or of Tierra del Fuego is much less than that between the Californian or Patagonian and a Plato, 241</page><page sequence="10">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 / 2 Leibniz, or Newton.... Taken as one degree of being versus another degree of being, the difference between the more perfect animal, the elephant for instance or the beaver, and the more imperfect one, the oyster or the polyp, is strikingly greater than the difference between the humans we call uncivilized and the so-called higher animals. (548) In other words, if it were not for the qualitative difference between humans and animals, humanity would lose its contours, disappearing into animality. This loss of contours occurs insofar as one views creation purely in terms of quantita- tively, hierarchically ordered levels of being, and from this perspective racism and cultural chauvinism remain for Jacobi in any case presupposed. But the loss of the distinctness of humanity is prevented insofar as one posits reason/faith as the essence of the human. Jacobi is now willing, it seems, to suspend his ethnic, religiocultural, and racial prejudices, at least if this means that he can thereby safeguard his own humanity. But this appearance is deceptive: the presence of the human essence in all apparently human beings is not quite assured. It is perfectly possible for what appears to be human to be inhuman, indeed to be infinitely worse than inhuman, because the presence of reason or faith depends on both the disposition of the will and the cul- tural-historical situation of the individual human being, a situation for which Jacobi holds each individual implicitly responsible. The border between the inhuman and the human-by means of which, I am suggesting, all humanity communicates with its own inhumanity-is thus here still being sacrificially displaced onto those humans who either do not yet possess or already consciously reject the "true" faith. Despite appearances, the inhumanity of humanity is here-in pre-Enlightenment style-the inhumanity of those humans who actively reject their humanness, even if this rejec- tion consists only in being born in the wrong place at the wrong time (and therefore unable to accept divine revelation).18 Jacobi states the voluntary basis of the human essence-one must will the will-in both conceptual and affective terms. In conceptual terms, this pre- supposition is quite explicit: This faith dwells in every man just as certainly as, in virtue of his rationality, every man necessarily presupposes a truth in itself, and a goodness and beauty that is no mere non-nothing. And he only be- comes man with this presupposition, and through it. (545) Whoever does not have such faith, whoever does not "presuppose" on the level of rational feelings a divine "truth in itself, and a goodness and beauty," is not human. Much worse than the animal, who is firmly on the far side of the distinction between animal and human, the person who fails to presuppose truth, goodness, and beauty as divine objects of faith is antihuman, because-on and as the (undoing of the) limit between animal and human-such a person renounces his or her humanity. In affec- tive terms, Jacobi is even more explicit: When we say of a man that he is without all feelings, we do not simply equate him to an animal but cast him way below, even lower than the animal, for we must assume that, as a man, he was endowed with feelings by nature, and that he could only have divested himself 242</page><page sequence="11">LIBRETT / Humanist Antiformalism of them freely. Hence, even though animals are totally incapable of the knowledge of the good, the true and the beautiful, we can still love them, and enter into a sort of friendly relationship with them. But we look upon the man who is not incapable of that knowledge but has estranged himself from it unnaturally [widernatiirlich], either in horror, as a disgusting monster, or with fright and loathing, as a satanic being [entweder als eine ekelhafte Mifgeburt, nur mit Grauen, oder als ein satanisches Wesen, nur mit Entsetzen und Abscheu]. (564) If the "satanic monsters" who appeared during Jacobi's long career as a philosopher and polemicist-especially the Enlighteners and the early Romantics and Idealists-were ever intimidated by the antiformalist rhetoric of this humanism to the point of feeling compelled to respond publicly to Jacobi's texts, it is no doubt because they, metaphysicians all, shared (and they knew their reading public shared) his anxiety about the materiality of forms and the formality of matter. Many of Jacobi's opponents were, however, significantly more patient than he in that they tended to posit an infinite temporal horizon for progress toward the ultimate telos of humanity. Jacobi, by contrast, demanded the achievement of this end right now, through faith. Out of infinite impatience, Jacobi called for the immediate and total anthropo- morphization of the human-divine sphere.19 If he usefully exacerbated his contempo- raries' already painful awareness of the infinite dissonance-between faith and knowl- edge, humanity and its forms-that their ideas concerning infinite progress would have to endure, he also set a precedent for the denegation of the necessity of this dissonance. The transcendence of formalism that he proposed could be achieved only through the (sacrificial) identification of certain restricted forms with particular popu- lations, all of which would have to be kept out of the human community: neither friends nor siblings but only the bearers of that indistinction between human and nonhuman that makes both of these terms indistinct, "enemies" all.

For Jacobi, friendship presupposes humanity, whereas for Lessing, according to Hannah Arendt (in "On Humanity in Dark Times: Thoughts About Lessing," trans. Clara and Richard Winston, in Men in Dark Times [New York: Harcourt, Brace, and World], 3-32), humanity presupposes friendship. Further- more, if for Lessing, according to Arendt, there is no humanity without discourse, for Jacobi, humanity takes place only where discourse, understood as rhetoric and representation, ceases. 5. Material form is to be starkly contrasted with substantial form, a scholastic notion which, accord- ing to Jacobi, Leibniz treats in a way that crucially differentiates him from Spinoza; see Jacobi, David Hume iiber den Glauben; oder Idealismus und Realismus (Breslau: Lowe, 1785); F. H. Jacobi, Main Philosophical Writings, 312-19, 322-23. 6. According to Martin Heidegger, humanism is an attempt to provide humanity with an essence (see Uber den Humanismus [Frankfurt am Main: Vittorio Klostermann, 1949]), whereas Luc Ferry and Alain Renaut (see Heidegger et les modernes [Paris: Grasset and Fasquelle, 1988]) present humanism as the denial of any essence to the human (the distinguishing feature of man being the capacity to get free of any attribution of essence); what we learn from Jacobi's oeuvre is that these two aspects of humanism- essentialization and de-essentialization or emancipation-are inseparable. The analysis undertaken here thus tends to confirm Jacques Derrida's argument on the necessary intertwinement of humanism with antihumanism in "Les fins de l'homme," Marges de la philosophie (Paris: Minuit, 1972), 129-64; cf. E. Levinas, "Humanisme et an-archie," Humanisme de l'autre homme (Paris: Fata Morgana, 1972), 71-92. 7. The main texts of Jacobi to which I refer in this section are Uber die Lehre des Spinoza in Briefen an den Herrn Moses Mendelssohn (Breslau: Lowe, 1785) and Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi wider Mendelssohns Beschuldigungen betreffend die Briefe iiber die Lehre des Spinoza (Leipzig: Goeschen, 1786). Citations of the former (hereafter, The Doctrine of Spinoza) are given in the text and refer to F. H. Jacobi, Main Philosophical Works: citations of the latter in my own translation are to Die Hauptschriften zum Pantheismusstreit zwischen Jacobi und Mendelssohn, ed. Heinrich Scholz (Berlin: Reuther and Reichard, 1916). On the Spinoza-debates in Germany, see David Bell, Spinoza in Germany from 1670 to the Age of Goethe (London: Institute of Germanic Studies, 1984); and Sylvain Zac, Spinoza en Allemagne: Mendelssohn, Lessing et Jacobi (Paris: Meridiens Klincksieck, 1989). 8. F. H. Jacobi, The Doctrine of Spinoza, 248-50 and passim. 9. The closely entangled textual relationship between Jacobi and the academic leader of the Burschenschaften, Jakob Friedrich Fries, who incited the anti-Semitic Hep-Hep riots of 1818, still needs to be studied from this point of view. Jacobi cites Fries repeatedly in the "Preface and also Introduction to the Author's Collected Philosophical Works," which I discuss below, while Fries writes a text supporting Jacobi's attack on Schelling, and he also includes a character of Jacobi's, Woldemar, in his Julius und Evagoras (Heidelberg: C. E Winter, 1822). On Fries, see Leon Poliakov, The History of Anti-Semitism, trans. Miriam Kochan (New York: Vanguard Press, 1975), 3: 300-305. 10. See Gershom Scholem, "Die Wachtersche Kontroverse uiber den Spinozismus und ihre Folgen," in Spinoza in der Friihzeit seiner religiosen Wirkung, ed. Karlfried Grunder and Wilhelm Schmidt-Biggemann (Heidelberg: Lambert Schneider, 1984), 24-25. 11. Cf. Heiko A. Oberman, Wurzeln des Antisemitismus (Berlin: Severin und Seidler, 1981); and Sander L. Gilman, Jewish Self-Hatred: Anti-Semitism and the Hidden Language of the Jews (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1986), 57-68, esp. 607-9. 12. On the crypto-Catholicism controversy, including Enlightenment anti-Catholicism, see Di Giovanni's discussion in E H. Jacobi, Main Philosophical Writings, 20, 40, 89, 607-9. 13. In Uber die Empfindugen (Berlin: Voss, 1755), Mendelssohn had already anticipated the Counterenlightenment accusation that Enlightenment rationality was incompatible with friendship; see Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften: Jubiliiumsausgabe, ed. Fritz Bamberger (Berlin and Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt: Frommann, 1929-84), 1: 46. 14. In light of Jacobi's extensive translation of excerpts from Bruno-defender of Egyptian Hermeti- cism-as an example of pantheistic godlessness in the second edition of The Doctrine of Spinoza, see Martin Bernal on increasing hostility to the idea of an Egyptian origin to Greek philosophy (Black Athena: the Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization, vol. 1, The Fabrication of Ancient Greece, 1785-1985 [New Brunswick: Rutgers Univ. Press, 1987]).</page><page sequence="13">LIBRETT / Humanist Antiformalism 15. Kant presents friendship as a combination of love and respect. For Jacobi, this would amount to a conflation of friendship (spiritual content as homogeneity) and enmity (material form as heterogeneity). The "friend of man" (Menschenfreund) in Kant gives the distance of respect-the distance of differences in formal-material limitation-that Jacobi urges one not to give; see Kant, Die Metaphysik der Sitten, in Werkausgabe, ed. Wilhelm Weischedel (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1968), 8: 608-13. On the radicality and limits of Kant's new departure, see Jacques Derrida, Politiques de l'amitie, suivi de L'oreille de Heidegger (Paris: Galilke, 1994), 285-94. 16. The first "Socratization" of Mendelssohn occurred when he published his Leibnizian translation of Plato's Phaedo and was hailed as the "German Socrates." See Mendelssohn, Phddon oder uber die Unsterblichkeit der Seele (Berlin: Nicolai, 1767). 17. See "Jacobi an Fichte" and the main attack on Schelling, "Von den gottlichen Dingen und ihrer Offenbarung," both in Werke, vol. 3. 18. For Jacobi, science, itself less than human, is more human than "superstition" (Aberglaube), which is "perverted faith" (Afterglaube), and of which irrational animals are incapable (562). But since supersti- tion is the lack of faith in the true God (562), and since the true faith itself is "older than all the systems invented by man" (561), superstition is an active rejection of faith. 19. On Spinoza's refusal of the human-divine anthropomorphic couple, see Karl L6with, Gott, Mensch und Welt in der Metaphysik von Descartes bis zu Nietzsche (Gdttingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, 1967), 197-251. 245</page></plain_text>
