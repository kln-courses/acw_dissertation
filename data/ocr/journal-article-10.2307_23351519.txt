<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHETYPES, MODEL EMULATION, AND THE CONFUCIAN GENTLEMAN WILLIAM E. SAVAGE A topic raised throughout the early years of Chinese philosophy concerns definitions of human excellence and how it creates social order. Many early Chinese philosophers present their programs for the organization of the state and society by describing ideal personality types that exemplify the successful application of their programs. They portray a model of human excellence, his connection to and under standing of a cosmic basis, and how his personal excellence brings all under Heaven to their "proper order." This theme of human excellence also appears in sources predating the emergence of Chinese moral phi losophy. It is found in the pronouncements of Western Chou royalty and nobility. The Western Chou aristocracy expressed their singularity and legitimized their status through a political theology, a definition of the state and political authority that connected the ruling elite to the divine.1 Many elements of this political theology came to denote fun damental concepts in the Chinese philosophical tradition. In this article, I will trace part of that process, relying primarily on inscriptions on bronze ritual vessels, but also drawing on other sources on the Western Chou including the Shih-ching or The Book of Songs, and the Shu-ching or The Book of Documents.2 1. The term "political theology" is borrowed from Ernst H. Kantorowicz, The King's Two Bodies: A Study in Medieval Political Theology (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1957). 2. The "Chou-sung" fSj and "Ta-ya" A 91 sections of the Shih-ching are the main stays of our literary sources. The "Chou-sung" contains the earliest odes, probably originating sometime between the turn of the twelfth and middle of the eleventh centuries B.C.; see Fu Ssu-nien "(#S"Shih-ching chiang-yi kao" in Fu Meng-chen hsien-sheng chi (Taipei: n.p., 1951), vol. 2, part b, 18-33 and 46-51; also see C.H.

Model emulation and presentation played important roles establishing and supporting the legitimacy of the Western Chou hereditary elite. This topic has received some attention; but more can be said on what a model is and what is gained through model emulation. In this discussion, the image of Wen Wang will be seen to dominate royal model emulation and presentation. His personal excellence provides the object of model emulation and the content of model presentation. From that perspective, I will then examine how emulation of an archetype based on the image of Wen Wang helped define and support the status of the Western Chou nobility. Finally, 1 will conclude this discussion with an examination of descriptions of the chun-tzu in the Analects, showing the extension of this royal example into the Confucian ideal of the gentleman. Ch'u Wan-li IB M £, Shih-ching shih-i nflSS (Taipei: I lua-kang, 1974), 261. How ever, the "Chou-sung" and the remainder of the Shih-ching underwent continual mod ification as they were transmitted. There was no fixed text until the Shih-ching took its final form sometime between the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. C.H. Wang, The Bell and the Drum (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1974), 95-96, speaks of a "for mative age" of the Shih-ching that extended from the dawn of the empire through the time of Confucius. Originating in the early Western Chou, these odes certainly pre serve ideas representative of their source. However, since they were not fixed in their present form until the seventh to sixth centuries B.C., I limit their application to the latter half of the Western Chou. An equally problematic source is the Shu-ching HrH, a collection of announcements or proclamations reportedly documenting important events of the early Western Chou. I take the "Ta-kao" ;*C?S, "K'ang-kao" iSf£, "Chiu-kao" HIS, "Lo-kao" i#f£, "To-shih" # ±, "Chiin-shih" g1^, "To-fang" # , "Shao-kao" -0 IS, "Ku-ming" H and "Wen-hou chih ming" np chapters of the Shu-ching as Western Chou sources. H.H. Dubs, "The Archaic Royal Chou Religion," T'oung Pao 46.5 (1958), 224, reduces his sources to the first seven. H.G. Creel, The Origins of Statecraft in China (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970), 447-463, would add the "Tzu-ts'ai" # and "Pi-shih" H ff chapters. The "Tzu-ts'ai" chapter seems to be fragments in the style of a later Western Chou bronze inscription garbled through Eastern Chou moralism. Ch'u Wan-li, Shang-shu shih-i fnf !r#ii (Taipei: Hua-kang, 1956), 134, has shown that the "Pi-shih" is a product of the Eastern Chou. Like the early strata of the Shih-ching, these chapters originated in the early years of the Western Chou and contain an important core of early Western Chou elements. But a number of other themes also suggest a late Western Chou hand. In particular, the idealization of the king's loyal servant is a clear indication of their lateness. As I will show below, this idealization originated in the mid-Western Chou. Consequently, I have employed these chapters of the Shu-ching as representative of thought current during the latter half of the Western Chou.</page><page sequence="3">WILLIAM E. SAVAGE Western Chou Political Theology The kings of the Western Chou dynasty, 11227-771 B.C., formulated their legitimacy by linking the throne to a higher authority; they con stantly aspired to the divine. Their claims to authority were supported by the doctrine that the founder of the Chou enjoyed contact with divinity. The inscription on the Shih Ch'iang p'an begins: It is said, in ages past Wen Wang was first to achieve concordance in government. Shang Ti bestowed a peerless virtue upon him and he was greatly protected. Throughout the land he rendered assistance to high and low; bringing them together, he received the myriad states.3 According to Western Chou sources, the first Chou king received a Mandate from Heaven, T'ien-ming ^ nfr, a divine decree giving the Chou kings the right to rule and legitimizing their replacement of the preceding dynasty. In the Shih-ching, "Huang-i" M ^ (Mao 241), we find: August is Ti on High, Majestically drawing close to those below, Inspecting and regarding the four corners of the world, Seeking tranquility for the people. In these two states, Their governments had not prevailed. Those four kingdoms, Were plumbed and measured. Ti on High brought it to a settlement, And hated their extravagance. Looking about he turned his gaze westward; There he made an abode. Ti shifted his bright virtue; Bringing together the tribes, fixing their course. Heaven established its counterpart; The receipt of the Mandate was secure. 3.

In particular, stories of receipt of the Mandate customarily refer to Wen Wang's virtue or te Virtue set the founder of the Chou apart from other men. He merited divine approval through this attribute of his personal excellence. In another ode from the Shih ching, "Wei T'ien chih ming" (Mao 267), we read: Now the Mandate of Heaven, Solemn and never ending. Indeed, it was greatly glorious, The singularity of Wen Wang's virtue. Another feature of Western Chou political theology is the centrality of ruling personalities. This centrality is not strictly geographic, but rather is ideological. The king appears at the center of the social order to perform those acts which most affect society. As the inscription on the Ho tsun J?# bronze from the reign of Ch'eng Wang shows, China was the Central Kingdom and the king ruled from its center. In the fourth month, on the day ping-hsii, the king announced to the young nobles of the royal line. He said: Of old, your ancestor of this ducal clan ably supported Wen Wang; then Wen Wang received this Great Command. And when Wu Wang had overcome the great city Shang, he then in the court announced to Heaven saying, "I shall reside in these central lands and from here rule the people."4 This same notion appears in the "Shao Kao" chapter of the Shu-ching. May the king come and continue the work of Ti on High and him self serve in the center of the lands . . . may he make this great city and from here be a counterpart to Heaven. He will carefully make his sacrifices to above and below and from this center shall govern.5 4. See T'ang Lan, "Ho-tsun ming-wen chieh-shih" Wen-wu 1976.1, 60-63.

Similar patterns of centrality occur in the ancient Near East; see John M. Lundquist, "Studies</page><page sequence="5">WILLIAM E. SAVAGE One more trait of Western Chou political theology concerns access to the past, a connection to history. Like other traditional societies, the Western Chou looked upon the past as a time of origins, a time of begin nings that had a paradigmatic value for the present. The most signifi cant event in history was the founding of the dynasty. This was when the arrangements of human life were established, when the hierarchy of social positions took form and their relations prescribed. In other words, the beginning of the dynasty represents the creation of order.6 The founder of the dynasty appears as the creator or at the very least re creator of pattern and order in human life. Hence, it was the duty of his descendents to continue what he had begun. This notion, too, is found in both bronze inscriptions and in the Shu-ching. The Ta Yii ting M states: The king spoke thus: Greatly illustrious was Wen Wang; he received Heaven's Great Command. Then it rested with Wu Wang to continue the state made by Wen. He opened new territories and extensively possessed the four corners of the world . . 7 Similarly, the "Ta Kao" "XWi (Shu-ching: 1.192-193) states: Now, you men have been with us a long time ... You know how Wen Wang labored. Now, when Heaven has belabored us to com plete this task, I dare not but fully prosecute and complete the planned work of Wen Wang . . . This impulse to continue the past also involves an emphasis on the universality of the order created by Wen Wang. Chou supremacy was for all times and all places.8 on the Temple in the Ancient Near East" (Ph.D. dissertation: University of Michigan, 1983), 84-147. 6. The ancient Near Eastern tradition provides many parallels: for example, see John A. Wilson, The Culture of Ancient Egypt (Chicago: Phoenix Books, 1951), 48; Henri Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1948), 231-238, and Frank Moore Ross, "The Priestly Tabernacle in the Light of Recent Research," in Temples and High Places in Biblical Times, ed., Avraham Biran (Jerusalem: The Nelson Glueck School of Biblical Archaeology, 1981), 174. 7.

The Chiin-shih 5^ chapter of the Shu-ching (1.249) emphasizes this univer sality. Together, we shall complete the work of Wen Wang without falling into idle ness. It shall grandly cover to the corners of the sea and to where the sun rises. There shall be none who do not follow and obey.</page><page sequence="6">THE CONFUCIAN GENTLEMAN These characteristics of Western Chou political theology show that politico-religious relations of dominance often were translated into relations of heritage. An important part of Western Chou legitimacy rested on the possession of family history, ancestral glory, and inherited status. In other words, access to the past, to history, represented a basic assumption about relations of dominance and subordination between men.9 It anchored existing conditions of dominance in the past and legitimized them through an account of the personalities and events that set royalty apart from those below them. Thus, a final element of Western Chou political theology, the kings' copying the examples of royal ancestors, was a powerful expression of their status. It demon strated the Chou kings' connection to history, possession of ancestral glory and their status in an already established hierarchy. In the constellation of values accepted by both the royalty and nobili ty of early China, an obvious but little studied component is the clear emphasis placed on model emulation and presentation.10 It was a fairly common device in Western Chou bronze inscriptions to raise ancestral figures as exemplifying the archetypes upon which the present should be modeled and the standards against which it should be judged. Indi vidual kings and nobles come and go in the histories of the throne and the clan. What remained were the master images of kingship and nobil ity they took as their templates and through which they defined their exceptional status.11 Western Chou literature, in contrast to the inscrip 9. Similar conceptions are found in other so-called "primitive" societies. For the Luapula people in Africa, only the king possesses a complete recorded genealogy. The genealogies of status groups beneath him are compressed into a few generations preserved in the memories of the living. See Ian Cunnison, "History and Genealogies in a Conquest State," American Anthropologist 59.1 (1957), 20-31. This characterization of the Western Chou emphasis on the past is derived from a similar view of archaic civilizations found in Mircea Eliade, The Sacred and the Profane, trans. Willard R. Trask (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World Inc., 1959), 85. For a similar view of ancient Egypt, Babylonia and Mesopotamia, see Milton Covensky, The Ancient Near Eastern Tradition (New York: Harper and Row, 1966). 10. Kuo Mo-jo took notice of the importance of model emulation in the bronze inscriptions, but never went beyond mentioning it; see Kuo Mo-jo, Chin-wen ts'ung k'ao jfeXSS# (Peking: Jen-min ch'u-pan-she, 1954), 11-14. The extension of Western Chou model emulation into the philosophical thought of the Eastern Chou has received extensive treatment in Donald J. Munro, The Concept of Man in Early China, (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1969), 96-116. 11. These aspirations of the Chou aristocracy are similar to themes present in Clifford Geertz's analysis of the nineteenth century Balinese state, where the court and capital are portrayed as the microscopic image of the cosmic order and the model for the political order existing within the state. Behind the ruling elite's self perception, which Geertz calls the "doctrine of the exemplary center," lies the central</page><page sequence="7">WILLIAM E. SAVAGE tions, contains more instances of model presentation, the correlate of model emulation. Presenting a model of human excellence required compliance by those below and established order. 1 will begin with a discussion of royal model emulation and presentation and will then proceed to discuss model presentation and emulation within the nobility. Royal Model Emulation and Presentation It is most appropriate and perhaps not a historical accident that the founder of the Chou dynasty and the pattern for succeeding kings was called Wen. There is an abundance of evidence that a sense of "pattern" dominated the early meaning of the term.12 Western Chou sources political idea that "... by the mere act of providing a model, a paragon, a faultless image of civilized existence — the court shapes the world around it to at least a rough approximation of its own excellence"; Clifford Geertz, Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980), 13. Also see Robert Heine-Geldern, "Conceptions of State and Kingship in Southeast Asia," Far Eastern Quarterly 2 (1942), 15-30. 12. The Shuo-wen defines wen as "drawn lines, design or pattern" comprised of intersecting lines: Xfa Stk; Hsu Shen fftX Shuo-wen chieh-tzu (Taipei: Yi-wen, 1976 ed.), 429. The same idea of pattern or lines occurs in the "Ku-ming" HI np section of the Shu-ching where wen is used in the compound wen-pei XM, "striped cowries"; Shu-ching (1.278). And in the Shih-ching, "Liu yueh" 7\ M (Mao 177), wen appears in a compound referring to woven patterns in battle flags. This emphasis on pattern and design is also present in another early dictionary. The Shih-ming glosses wen as a combination of variegated colors to make ornamented silk; Shih-ming f? 45 (Ts'ung-shu chi-ch'eng ed.), 4.51. Bernhard Karlgren explains wen as "drawn lines, design, ornaments or ornamented"; Grammata Serica Recensa, Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities 29 (1957), #475 a-g. Hence, the early dictionaries and later scholars provide a group of words: pattern, design, drawn lines or stripes as the most substantive or concrete definition of wen. It is interesting that Kato Joken Jjp H§ S St interprets wen as a picture of braided rope used to make patterns or designs on pot tery; Bu no kanji bun no kanji (Tokyo: Kakukawa shoten, 1978), 141. In spite of the inherent weaknesses of pictographic interpretation, this view of the root meaning of the graph is preferable to the traditional interpretation and a recent "metaphysical" interpretation. The traditional explanation of the graph is that it depicts a full frontal view of a man with a tattoo on his chest and designated the shih P, the impersonator of the dead. The extended meaning of the term was "deceased" and referred to the ancestors; see Wu Ch'i-ch'ang MKS, Yin-hsu shu-ch'i chieh-ku 15 Wen-che chi-k'an 3-6 (1934-1937); (rpt., Taipei: Yi-wen, 1964), 226-227; also see Chu Fang-p'u Tfcjf EH, Yin Chou wen-tzu shih-ts'ung | (Peking: Chung-hua, 1962), 66-68. However, support for this theory only appears in late texts like the Li-chi i® IB ("Wang-chih" ZE ®J [Shih-san-ching chu-shu ed.], 5.247), where tattooing is described as a barbarian custom. Chow Tse-tsung, "Ancient Chinese Views on Literature, the Tao, and Their Relationship," Chinese Literature:</page><page sequence="8">THE CONFUCIAN GENTLEMAN depict Wen Wang as an exemplary figure whose name symbolized his personal excellence, his career on the throne, and what he bequeathed to his successors. His virtue gained the attention of the deity, T'ien ^ or Ti and merited the Mandate of Heaven. Through his personal excellence, he brought about peaceful integration and established order among men. The imitation of Wen Wang exhibits two important themes. Wen Wang constantly appears as the paradigm of the order-creating ruler. Having established the dynasty, his image is habitually recalled to con firm the order of the Chou state and the king's ascendancy in it. Second, Wen Wang never encounters opposition. His example meets with an ease, accommodation, and concurrence. Through the force of his per sonal excellence, this prototype of the order-creating ruler compelled others to take their proper places. Hence, royal pronouncements in the inscriptions occasionally raise his example in their opening statements to establish royal authority.13 As early as the third generation Chou king, the monarch claimed to exercise his authority through emulation of Wen Wang and his virtue. The inscription on the Ta Yii ting (Ta-hsi, 3.33), generally dated to the reign of K'ang Wang, quotes the king: The king spoke thus: . . . Now as I have copied the model stored in Wen Wang's correct virtue, and am like Wen Wang commanding his various functionaries, I now order you . . . At other times, royal references to exemplary standards do not mention a specific personality. Instead, they recall the "former king" or "kings." One reference appears in the mid-Western Chou inscription on the Shih Hu kuei ® ^ S (Ta-hsi, 3.73) recording a noble's succession to a hereditary post. The reigning king prefaces his orders by recalling how his predecessor had commissioned the noble's legator to fill the same position. The king then describes himself as following the example of the former king's commands as he issues his own decrees of succes sion. In two later inscriptions, those of the Mu kuei % 31 (Ta-hsi, 3.75) and Mao-kung ting (Ta-hsi, 3.134), the king charges his nobles with the injunction to follow the bright examples of the former king or kings as they carry out their duties. In these sources, the imitation of Essays, Articles, Reviews 1.1 (1979), 5-12, argues that the graph for wen pictographically represents the joining of Heaven and Earth. However, his argument fails to take into account that the pairing of Heaven and Earth as metaphysical polarities does not appear in our sources until the Eastern Chou. 13. The "Shao-kao" chapter of the Shu-ching presents another good example of model presentation. I follow the reading of Ch'ii Wan-li, Shang-shu shih-i, 94.</page><page sequence="9">WILLIAM E. SAVAGE royal example remains within the ruling elite and generally appears in command situations. In the transmitted literature, model presentation appears more often. An excellent picture of model presentation is found in the Shih-ching poems "Ssu ch'i" (Mao 240) and "Hsia wu" T(Mao 243). He was obedient to the deceased clan lords; No spirit begrudged him, No spirit found fault in him. He became a model to his consort. It extended to his brothers; And so he governed his family and state. Having achieved the trust of the king, He is a pattern to the earth below. Forever filial and thoughtful, Filial and thoughtful, he is the norm. The first ode describes Wen Wang; the second portrays one of his suc cessors. In these descriptions of examples that flowed from the throne, the recipients of model presentation are not restricted to the members of the ruling elite. As the poem "I" #P (Mao 256) shows, the exercise of authority through the presentation of examples extended beyond those who governed to become an aspect of governing the state and people. None can contend with this man; The states of the four corners of the world take their lessons from him. Straight is his virtuous conduct; All the states comply with him. With grand patterns he has settled the Mandate, With far reaching plans he makes his timely announcements. Respectful and careful in his demeanor, He is a pattern for the people. Make lawful your practice of virtue, Cause it to be good and fine. Be doubly careful in your demeanor, do not fail in your deportment, And few will not make you their model. Coercive power is conspicuously absent in these formulations of polit ical authority. In its place, the king's personal presentation of a model</page><page sequence="10">10 THE CONFUCIAN GENTLEMAN appears as an order-creating activity in its own right. A royal model is normative; it exemplifies standards of order to which all must conform. His example demonstrates his exalted position in the hierarchy of human organization because the models he imitates in the present are derived from the examples of the past. This is illustrated by two other poems, first "Lieh Wen" (Mao 269), and second, "Wen Wang" (Mao 235). Without opposition is this man, The four corners of the world obey him. Very illustrious is his virtue, All the rulers take him as a model. It is true! The former kings have not been forgotten! The Mandate is not easy; Do not let it end in yourselves . . . The workings of Heaven on High Are beyond our perception, One should take Wen Wang as his pattern; The myriad states will ally themselves with him. Here we can extend an earlier observation on how possession of history anchored an exalted status in the past and clothed it with the aura of divinity. In ancient China, possession of ancestors and access to the past distinguished the aristocracy from the remainder of society. This bears directly on the Western Chou king for, in some respects, he possessed history and participated in history more than any other member of Chou society. His access to the past is evident in our sources. Western Chou bronze inscriptions and literature are customarily dated according to the reigning king's accession dates. The past was measured according to the successive reigns of his ancestors, the present existed as an extension of his reign, and the future belonged to his descendents. This was a commonplace, a simple fact of existence, in Western Chou China. But, it is precisely those simple facts of life that carry the greatest weight. Thus, when emulating examples from the past, particularly Wen Wang, the king claimed for himself the personal excellence asso ciated with the ancestors. His presentation of a model then became an expression of his own excellence. It indicated his status and the status of those below him. The absence of coercive power does not lessen the effectiveness of model presentation as an instrument of authority. The display of royal excellence confirmed an already established hierarchy.</page><page sequence="11">WILLIAM E. SAVAGE 11 Model Emulation within the Nobility Representation of noble ancestors as exemplary figures can be traced to the mid-Western Chou. Occasionally, the king would order a noble to follow the example of his ancestor when he succeeded to his legator's position.14 There are several inscriptions from the later Western Chou where nobles raise ancestral examples in their own declarations. Two mid-Western Chou inscriptions are noteworthy for they contain re presentations of the nobility that combine model emulation and presen tation into a single image of aristocratic excellence. Both inscriptions follow conventional style and form by recording awards from superiors and praise for ancestral merit. They differ from other inscriptions in their final dedicatory statements. The Lu-po Tung kuei {£ Si (Ta hsi, 3.62), dated to the reign of Mu Wang, ends on a note of continua tion: "May my innumerable descendents emulate the example of receiving this grace." The Shen-tzu kuei (Ta-hsi, 3.46), dated to the reign of Chao Wang, contains similar sentiments: "May I, T'a, there by comfort the many generations below me; may my descendents be able to preserve this exemplary instruction." The distinguishing trait of these inscriptions is their emphasis on the continuation of the past through the models of the living. The nobles who commissioned these vessels and their inscriptions are living examples or "apprentice ancestors," exemplary figures who par ticipate in history by carrying on family merit for the benefit of later generations.15 Their forebears had already distinguished the family name. Their own accomplishments contribute an even greater glory and this is what they pass on to their successors. These inscriptions show that the values surrounding exemplary behavior were well developed and appreciated by the time of the mid-Western Chou. They also indi cate that the nobility employed emulation of exemplary family figures for the exaltation and transmission of family status. This participation in history is a pronounced characteristic of later Western Chou inscrip tions from the ranks of the nobility. 14. The Shih Tsai ting SfifftJ#, dated to the reign of Kung Wang, states: Avail yourself of the model of your wise ancestor who was brilliant and faithful as he served the previous king; serve me the one man! The inscription is reproduced in "Shan-hsi-sheng Fu-feng-hsien Ch'iang-chia-ts'un ch'u-t'u ti Hsi-Chou t'ung-ch'i" Wen-wu 1975.8,57-62. 15. The role of "apprentice ancestors" in reserving a part of history for the clan is analyzed in Gillian Feeley-Harnik, "Divine Kingship and the Meaning of History among the Sakalava of Madagascar," Man 13.3 (1978), 407.</page><page sequence="12">12 THE CONFUCIAN GENTLEMAN Royal pronouncements recorded in Western Chou sources generally begin by recounting the receipt of the Mandate of Heaven. The epic of Wen Wang grounds political discourse and royal authority in the past. The Western Chou nobility also raised images of their ancestors to define and legitimate their status. This is most apparent in an important group of long declarations from around the reign of Li Wang, the tenth Chou king. These inscriptions share a substantial similarity of style and terminology. Almost all open with the declaration of the noble who commissioned the vessel. He identifies himself and the ancestor he is celebrating. This is followed by a formulaic description of ancestral excellence in service to the throne. The final step is an expression of his resolve to emulate ancestral example as he serves the reigning king. The Fan Sheng kuei (Ta-hsi, 3.133) is but one example.16 Greatly illustrious is my august elder. Stately in solemnity, he was able to make wise his virtue. Majestic on high, he broadly began for his descendents here below our accomplishments in the great ser vice. 1, Fan Sheng, dare not but emulate the example of my august ancestor's great original virtue and thereby expand the Great Command and protect the king's position. One of the honorifics used in the exaltation of noble ancestors is the term wen. Wen appears in most early sources in reference to the dead.17 Wen-fu jC 5£, wen-tsu ~$C IS, and wen-k'ao ~$C. % are common honorifics for both royal and noble ancestors. Since the Western Chou emphasized maintaining continuity with the past and recreating the past through model emulation, addressing the ancestors with this honorific clearly expresses an essential element of their excellence. The ancestors had cast the patterns for life. Much the same can be said about the founder of the Chou. The Chou kings raised the example of Wen Wang and his virtue to establish the singularity of the royal house. He was portrayed 16. For similar late Western Chou inscriptions see: Shih Wang ting Ta-hsi, 3.80; Shu Hsiang-fu kuei ® |r] 31, ibid., 3.132; Tan-po chung W- 18, ibid., 3.118; Kuo-shu Lii chung MMMM, ibid., 3.127; Ching-jen X chung # A5S, ibid., 3.150; Liang-ch'i chung ^ ^®, in Shang Chou chin-wen lu-i ® ^HIS, ed. Yii Hsing wu T il' Fi~ (Peking: K'o-hsiieh ch'u-pan-she, 1957), 3. 17. The term wen is rarely applied to the living. When it is, it carries a sense of confirming and celebrating the order among men. For example, the inscription on the Ling kuei ^ H (Ta-hsi, 3.3) records the queen's gift of cowries, servants or managers, and slaves to a noble, presumably as an indication that he was being awarded additional rank or official recognition of his service. A member of the queen's court carried out the bestowal of these gifts. When he received these gifts, the recipient cast a vessel extolling the queen's grace and the "elegant(?) favors," wen-pao ~$C of the noble who transported them.</page><page sequence="13">WILLIAM E. SAVAGE 13 as the originator of traditional institutions and values that kept the social order together and his descendents in that order's most honored positions. Consequently, the paradigm of Wen Wang was the dominant image of order and authority each succeeding king sought to claim for himself. Late Western Chou bronze inscriptions show a clear tendency toward symmetry in their representation of royal and noble status. From the mid-Western Chou on, the nobles also raised their ancestors as examples of their own distinction and addressed them using another honorific containing the potent word wen. The honorific ch'ien-wen-jen A, the "former exemplars," appears to extend the specific example of Wen Wang to a general image of ancestral excellence that was available to the entire nobility. I, Po Tung, having succeeded to my position, made a precious vessel for the western temple.

Longer inscriptions from the reign of the last two or three Western Chou kings describe the exemplary qualities of these patterns from the past in great detail. In the inscription on the Ching-jen X chung # (Ta-hsi, 3.150), a noble proclaims: Illustrious and fine was my exemplary ancestor, my august elder ... I dare not but emulate his example and employ my exemplary ancestor's stately and solemn hold on virtue. I look to the example of his wisdom and to his founding position in the chamber of the ancestral hall. I have thereby made for Father Ho this great cherished bell. I shall use it to pursue my filial duty and to rejoice my former exemplar. Majestic on high is my former exemplar. In copious abundance, you have conferred upon me a substantial bounty of blessings without end. May I for a myriad years with my descendents forever treasure and use this to celebrate you.19 18.

Wen Wang represented the origin and glory of the royal house. He established family honor with his receipt of the Mandate and transmitted it to his successors. The honorific ch'ien-iven-jen made available to the nobility the same histor ical status. Those noble ancestors demonstrated the nobility's connec tion to something higher just as the image of Wen Wang served the king. The former exemplars appear in these inscriptions as personalities who created and sustained the clan and its dignity. They represent the clan's station in life and provide the image of divinity upon which clan status is founded. Through ritual accounts of their virtue and majesty, they became counterparts to the image of the founder of the Chou. Addressing their ancestors with this honorific, the nobility's claims to excellence and human worth became mirror images of royal declara tions; both were anchored in the past in figures who bore the name wen. Another area of a developing symmetry between representations of royal and noble status involves the possession of virtue, te. Earlier, we saw the legitimacy of the king's commands expressed through his emulation of Wen Wang's "correct virtue."20 The term translated as "correct," cheng IE, functions elsewhere as an adjective or verb, "ordered" or "put in order," and sometimes as cheng "to govern." All these ideas form important parts of the Western Chou conception of their right to rule and how they should conduct government. Wen Wang's possession of virtue was a sign of personal correctness. His relationships with the dead and the living were conducted in a manner that satisfied the deity Tien or Ti. This led to receipt of the Mandate, the founding of the dynasty, and establishment of proper order among men. He was met with compliance or acquiescence by all who en countered him. This view of Wen Wang and his virtue appears in the opening statement of the Shih Ch'iang p'an inscription from the reign of the sixth Chou king, Kung Wang, translated above (p. 3). Another inscription, that of the Mao Kung ting (Ta-hsi, 3.134), probably containing the pronouncements of Hsuan Wang, continues this theme with an account of the first two Chou kings. The king spoke thus: Elder Yin, greatly illustrious were kings Wen and Wu. August Heaven was profoundly satisfied with their virtue kuei" Wen-wu 1979.4, 89-91. This vessel was commissioned by Li Wang and contains the king's own references to the former exemplars. 20. See the quotation of the Ta Yii ting inscription above, p. 5.</page><page sequence="15">WILLIAM E. SAVAGE 15 and made as its counterpart our Chou state. Rightly they received the Great Command and embraced all territories so that there were none who were not bounded by the glory of Wen and Wu. Western Chou narratives illustrating royal virtue customarily present Wen Wang as the paradigm of the man who possesses virtue. When later kings are described, the royal virtue they exercise is tied to the founder of the dynasty in its expression and the role it performs is the same unification he began. For example, in the Shih-ching poem "Chiang Han" tCSS (Mao 262), verse 6, we find: Bright upon bright is the Son of Heaven, His good fame never-ending. He spreads his wen-te and brings together these states of the four corners of the world.21 The customary association of virtue and Wen Wang or the term wen indicates the role of royal virtue in Western Chou political theology. Stories of the beginning of the dynasty are told and retold through the story of Wen Wang and his virtue. The founding of the dynasty re presented a time of origins when the order and arrangements of human life appeared in the world. Virtue provides a narrative framework that connects those significant events of the past. Wen Wang's virtue gained the attention of Heaven, provided for the receipt of the Mandate, and brought the outlying territories together into the proper order of a united empire. In other words, virtue "explains" the origins of the dynasty.22 Hence, in the early Western Chou bronze inscriptions, virtue 21. Here we can add H.G. Creel's observations on the traditional preference for Wen Wang. References to Wen Wang in the Shih-ching surpass those to Wu Wang by a margin of three to one. In the Shu-ching, the ratio is about two to one. See Creel, Statecraft, 64-65. 22. Shih-ching, "Huang i" (Mao 241), verse 4, is another example of how Wen Wang's virtue explains receipt of the Mandate. Now, this Wen Wang, Ti measured his resolve, Widespread was word of his virtue, He was capable of making clear-sighted his virtue, Capable of being clear-sighted, of distinguishing kinds, Capable of leading, of being lord. He became king of this great state, He achieved accommodation and concordance. (Ti) concorded with Wen Wang, His virtue caused no regret. And having received the blessings of Ti, He handed them down to his descendents. For other functions of the narrative of origins, see Percy S. Cohen, "Theories of Myth,"</page><page sequence="16">16 THE CONFUCIAN GENTLEMAN only appears in reference to the former kings or the reigning king. However, two inscriptions cited above in the discussion of the "former exemplars," ch'ien-wen-jen, indicate that by the reign of Mu Wang a diffusion of virtue to the nobility was underway. One of these, that of the Shan ting H jfff, (Ta-hsi, 3.65), records a noble's succession to a hereditary office. I, Shan, salute and bow my head. I dare to extol the magnificent grace of the Son of Heaven. I have thereby made this precious honored vessel for the ancestral chambers. May it be used to secure blessings from my former exemplars who hold firm to virtue respectfully and sincerely . . . These are noble ancestors, not former kings, who possess virtue. Though this much has changed, one constant relation remains. The possessors of virtue still have wen as part of their names. There was still a strong connection between virtue and the normative or exemplary standards expressed by the word wen and symbolized by the founder of the dynasty. By the late Western Chou, the diffusion of virtue had gone beyond noble ancestors to include their living descendents. Inscriptions from the reign of Li Wang contain the most complete expression of this diffusion. Living nobles claimed virtue for themselves through the emulation of ancestral example. The inscription on the Liang-ch'i chung SSS is one example.23 I, Liang-ch'i, proclaim: Greatly illustrious is my august elder. In stately solemnity and measured reverence, he was able to make wise his virtue; perpetually serving the former kings, he enjoyed complete good fortune without causing grief. May I, Liang-ch'i, begin to emulate the example of my august elder holding firm to bright virtue . . . The style and content of these inscriptions is quite similar to royal pronouncements. The king generally opens his declarations with references to Wen Wang and receipt of the Mandate. The history of the dynasty and the connection between its origins and his ancestors provide legitimacy to his utterances. The noble declarations in this group of inscriptions generally open with the proclamation of the noble who commissioned the vessel. He identifies himself and the ancestor he is celebrating. This is followed by formulaic descriptions of ancestral example, his virtue, service to the former kings or the Mandate and the Man 4.3 (1969), 337-353. 23. For this inscription, see Yii Hsing-wu, Shang Chou chin-wen lu-yi, 3.</page><page sequence="17">WILLIAM E. SAVAGE 17 noble's own expression of desire to emulate ancestral virtue. Again, an ancestral connection to dynastic history legitimizes his utterances. The over-all uniformity of the style and content in royal pronouncements is to be expected; it was in the interests of the royal house to promote a single version of history. However, these noble pronouncements show a remarkable consistency of their own. These accounts of ancestral excellence are presented through a rigo rous use of ritual language and a fixed narrative sequence. The compo sition of these pronouncements is so similar it sometimes seems as if only the names of ancestors and their descendents have been changed. Mircea Eliade has suggested that the structure of myth directs it toward functions other than simply telling a story. Myth recalls categories in place of events and mythic models instead of individuals. The historical figure is assimilated into a "mythical model" while the event becomes a "category of mythical action."24 When viewed in light of their similari ties, the narratives of these late Western Chou inscriptions seem to pres ent an image of a ministerial ideal that functions as a mythic character. The same vocabulary and narrative sequence appear again and again to describe a single master image projected onto the past, a paradigm of the king's loyal servant that represents the nobility's role and status in dynastic history. This idealized participant in the past made his own contribution to the unfolding of history as he served the throne. In this significant historical event, the master image of the king's loyal servant is a counterpart to the image of Wen Wang. He plays his own role in this divine mission and exercises his own virtue. Emulation of this master image made the virtue of the past available to the living. It became possible for living nobles to portray themselves as possessing virtue and participating in the prosecution of the Mandate. This elevated the excellence of the nobility one step closer to royalty. Parity between royalty and nobility occurred later in the Eastern Chou when noble lords began to claim the Mandate of Heaven for themselves. In the inscription on the Chin kung tsun If (Ta-hsi, 3.231), the Lord of Chin asserts that he is modeling himself on the virtue of the former kings and lays claim to an ancestral connection to the "Great Command," an alternative expression for the Mandate of Heaven. The Duke of Chin proclaims: It was my august ancestor, Duke T'ang, who received the Great Command. He assisted Wu 24. Mircea Eliade, Cosmos and History: The Myth of the Eternal Return, trans. Willard R. Trask (New York: Harper and Row, 1954), 35.</page><page sequence="18">18 THE CONFUCIAN GENTLEMAN Wang . . . The Duke proclaims: Now I, Wu, am but a small child; I dare not but emulate the example of the former kings holding firm to virtue . . . In the inscription on the Ch'in kung chung (Ta-hsi, 3.250), the assertions of the Lord of Ch'in concerning the Mandate are much more explicit. The Duke of Ch'in proclaims: Greatly illustrious is my august ancestor. Having received Heaven's Command, he ably assisted the states below ... I further proclaim: Though I am but a small child, in stately solemnity I hold firm to bright virtue, I astutely apply his bright example, reverent and respectful in my sacrifices, to receive a multitude of blessings. A more extensive idealization of the king's loyal minister is found in Western Chou literary sources. For example, it appears in the "Chiin shih" section of the Shu-ching where the ministers serving Wen Wang help him to adhere to his virtue. Without them and their instructions, he would have had no virtue to display to those below (Shu-ching, 1.247). At times, the ministerial ideal replaces the king and appropriates royal virtue to extend the Mandate and preserve the dynasty by himself. The paradigm of the king's loyal servant, the Duke of Chou, proclaims, "My conduct is an extension of Wen Wang's virtue. Heaven does not, therefore, end the Mandate received by Wen Wang" (Shu-ching, 1.245). The Shih P'ei kuei 8® IfJ II (Ta-hsi, 3.139), which may contain the words of Hsuan Wang, provides a fitting summary of the epic drama of Wen Wang and the virtue that sustained the Western Chou. The waning authority of the royal house and the rise of its vassals had transformed the story of Wen Wang's virtue into a tragedy. . . . How sorrowful it is that Heaven has unshackled its severity and brought calamity down upon us. Original virtue can no longer act as the rule and no one carries on for the former kings. Under pressure from barbarian invasions, the dynasty collapsed. The capital was moved to the east, opening a new era in the history of the dynasty and the history of ideas. The Confucian Analects The turmoil of the Spring and Autumn period followed the fall of the Western Chou. Struggles for power between and within Spring and Autumn states eventually weakened noble authority so that state rulers</page><page sequence="19">WILLIAM E. SAVAGE 19 often found themselves powerless at the hands of ministers or their underlings who exercised effective control over their states.25 Toward the end of the period, the Chou king and many of his lords were reduced to ineffectual figureheads, driftwood floating on the tumult of the times. The political theology supporting Spring and Autumn royalty and nobility also came open to question. Their legitimacy was chal lenged on a number of fronts. The social and political roles of the ministerial classes were reinterpreted to emphasize their achieved status and effective authority over the ascribed status of the hereditary elite.26 Ministerial families began to portray themselves as vital parts of the ruling apparatus, not appendages. The Tso-chuan Ix. M contains the following observations of the Historiographer Mo jfell: Kings have their dukes and the lords have their ministers; in both cases they are paired. Heaven gave rise to the Chi clan to act as the double for the lord of Lu. It has been such for a long time now and the people have submitted to it; is it not right? For generations now, the lords of Lu have continued their decline while for gener ations the Chi clan has improved in their diligence. The people have forgotten that there was a lord; so, though he has died abroad, who is there to pity him?27 Another tactic in the assault on hereditary privilege was to compare the roles and achievements of the ministerial class with the founders of the dynasty. On closer examination, some of the more detailed Spring and Autumn accounts of the founding of the Chou are not simple narratives of events. These accounts were intended to equate the first Chou kings with those who had taken over effective control of Spring and Autumn states.28 These trends reiterated the efforts of the Western Chou nobility 25. The constant struggle of the Spring and Autumn period is well described in Richard L. Walker, 77le Multi-State System of Ancient China, (Hamden, Conn: The Shoestring Press, 1953). For the changing social structure of the period, see Hsu Cho yun, Ancient China in Transition: An Analysis of Social Mobility 722-222 B.C.

This diffusion of Western Chou political theology provides an in structive background for study of the Confucian Analects. It reveals that many ideas expressed in the text reaffirm principles of legitimacy bor rowed from the past. At the same time, the text continues the Spring and Autumn debate concerning achieved and ascribed status. It explores the superiority of achieved excellence and presents this view of human worth as a new standard that could rectify the disorder of the times. Any man could acquire this excellence through education. Thus, a major theme of the Analects is that education is more than instruction in the polite arts. Education is part of a process of self cultivation through which a better person might make a better world. The goal of education was to become a chiin-tzu Wi "? or gentleman. The term chiin-tzu appears over one hundred times in eighty-six differ ent passages of the text. Moreover, in sixteen different passages, the figure of the gentleman stands in opposition to his inferior, the small man or lesser man. The purpose of these passages is definitional. An attempt was being made to define an ideal through placing it in contrast to its opposite. For example: The Master said, "The gentleman acquaints himself with what is right; the lesser man acquaints himself with what pays." (Analects 4/16) To become a gentleman a man must set himself on a course of learning. He must study the practices of the past to guide his behavior. These practices are contained in the Way or Tao, a self evident body of truths that provides him with standards of what is right and correct.29 Edu cation makes him personally correct and fit to correct others. In other own officers. He also gave a parcel of land to his son. Asking his advisor if this act would be seen as being partial, he received the following advice. Formerly, when Wu Wang subdued the Shang, he broadly possessed the empire. Fifteen of his brothers received states, while forty men of the royal surname also had states. All who were raised up were their kin. Now, there were no distinc tions for those who were raised up; only goodness was taken into account. Nearness and distance of relations were the same . . . What my lord has raised up approaches that of Wen Wang's virtue. What you have attained is far reach ing indeed. See Tso-chuan, Chao 28 (Legge, 725/727). In two other places in the Tso-chuan (Hsi 24 [Legge, 189/192] and Ting 4 [Legge, 750/754]), it is the Duke of Chou, not kings Wen or Wu, who enfeoffs the first lords of the Chou states to begin the Chou empire. 29. See, for example, Analects 1/14,4/8, and 6/17.</page><page sequence="21">WILLIAM E. SAVAGE 21 words, education makes a characteristic of the hereditary aristocracy available to the student. It entitles him to take the reigns of government. The Master said, "If a man makes himself correct, what difficulties would he encounter in pursuing governing. If unable to correct himself, how could he correct others?" (Analects 13/13) With this view of education, what had been an aristocratic inheri tance became part of the process of education and a subject of study. The right to rule was not the only aristocratic quality opened by educa tion. Learning also resulted in an opportunity to draw near to divinity. In one section of the Analects (14/35), Confucius describes learning as an activity that reaches on high so that he is known by Heaven. And in Confucius' description of his years of learning (Analects 2/4), education also allowed him to make his own connection to what Heaven had commanded, T'ien-ming. The acquisition of personal correctness, the right to rule, a connection to the divine, and an understanding of its commands are, in the Analects, all results of education. This democrati zation of aristocratic prerogative through education also appears in the goal of education. Several familiar components of Western Chou political theology are important attributes of the ideal of the gentleman. Wen is employed in a range of senses in the Analects. It retains its early sense of patterns and order found in an exemplary personality; but it also refers to a more general sense of refinement and accomplishment that approaches the idea of culture. More of this second sense will be seen later. For now, we should note that when wen appears in a definition of the gentleman, it sometimes carries the sense of pattern. The Master said, "When the raw material of a man measures more than the patterns (wen) he draws upon, then you have the brash ness of the barbarian. When the patterns (wen) a man draws upon measure more than the raw material that makes him, you have the preciseness of the pedant. But after pattern (wen) and raw material are brought into balance, you have a gentleman." (Analects 6/18) To be a gentleman requires a balance between what a man is born with, the raw matter or substance of the person, and the acquisition of patterns to give it form. The necessity to acquire patterns to counter balance a man's endowment at birth recalls the Spring and Autumn debate concerning achieved and ascribed status. This controversy is reflected in another section of the Analects that records a comment by a student of Confucius. Chi Tzu-ch'eng said, "A gentleman is so by virtue of the raw</page><page sequence="22">22 THE CONFUCIAN GENTLEMAN material that makes him; there is no more to the matter. What has patterns (wen) to do with making him?" Tzu-kung said, "An unfortunate choice of words, sir. Now that you have spoken of the gentleman a team of four horses could not overtake your tongue. In fact, pattern (wen) is comparable to that raw material and that raw material is comparable to pattern (wen), for the bare hide of a tiger or leopard is comparable to the bare hide of a dog or a goat." (Analects 12/8) Tzu-kung argues that without the distinctive markings of their stripes and spots, the hide of a leopard or tiger is no different from that of a dog or goat. Their basic stuff is the same; it is their distinctive markings (wen) that set them apart. The world of men is no different from the world of nature. There is no innately noble figure who stands apart from others by virtue of birth alone. From the early Confucian perspective, personal excellence is a matter of acquiring proper patterns or forms designated by the word wen. And when we look into the instruction Confucius of fered, we find wen is also a prominent part of the Confucian curriculum. It appears in definitions of the gentleman as culture. It is expressed in patterns of correct behavior the gentleman acquires through learning. The Master said, "A gentleman broadly learned in culture (wen) who restrains himself with ritual could not overstep proper bounds, I should think." (Analects 6/27) The Master took four subjects for instruction: culture (wen) and conduct, loyalty and sincerity. (Analects 7/25) Clearly, human worth was no longer measured according to the values of the hereditary aristocracy. It had become a matter of achieve ment, resting on an understanding of the standards governing conduct, on acquiring the correct patterns of behavior. However, culture indi cates more than proper individual behavior; it also exhibits a universal and historical sense. The culture that Confucius studied and used to instruct his students enjoys divine protection and is synonymous with the founder of the Chou, Wen Wang. The sign referring to the practices of the past and the symbol of the order-creating ruler dissolve into one and the same word. When the Master was endangered in K'uang, he said, "Wen Wang has already passed on; but does not his culture (wen) reside in me? If Heaven were about to let this culture (wen) perish, a latter day mortal such as myself would have been unable to draw near to it. If Heaven has yet to allow this culture (wen) to perish, what have the</page><page sequence="23">WILLIAM E. SAVAGE 23 men of K'uang to do with me?" (Analects 9/5) Culture also carries a historical significance applied to dynasties to indicate their refinement and their position in the succession of ruling houses. The Master said, "It is the Chou that looks over the two preceding dynasties. How complete is their culture (wen). I follow the Chou." (Analects 3/14) It is widely held that these passages express Confucius' admiration of Chou culture and his reliance on it for examples of excellence as he educated his students. This interpretation is correct; however, it fails to recognize the historical significance and universalization of the concept. In these passages, wen is something historical brought into the present. This view of culture in the Analects is a clear extension of the idealiza tion of Wen Wang discussed earlier. From the beginning of the Western Chou, the founder of the Chou exemplified the legitimacy of the Chou ruling house. During the latter half of the Western Chou, this ideal of individual excellence was abstracted into a general notion of the former exemplars, a composite of noble ancestors whose examples and powers re-created Wen Wang in a single image of noble excellence. Wen in the Analects shows a further abstraction away from an anthropomorphic image of human excellence into a set of patterns, refinements or accom plishments. Here, wen appears as culture, a body of refined practices persisting through history. The Western Chou kings participated in the past through emulating the example of Wen Wang. The Western Chou nobility increased their own historical significance through emulation of the former exemplars. As it appears in the Analects, wen is still an essential element of participation in the past. However, anyone who devoted himself to learning could come into contact with these patterns, reenact them, and re-create them in the present.30 Access to the past and the ability to re-create the patterns of the past were no longer distinctive traits of the hereditary aristocracy. Through education, it had become possible for anyone to achieve this measure of human worth. Virtue is another image of the gentleman's excellence. When atten tion is given to the context in which virtue appears, its most prominent feature is its association with governing and its expression of the excel lence of the man who governs. Virtue is, above all else, the personal 30. Peter Bol's excellent study of wen in Sung China reiterates many themes dis cussed here. See Peter Bol, "Culture and the Way in Eleventh Century China" (Ph.D. dissertation: Princeton University, 1982), especially 12-73 and 104-109.</page><page sequence="24">24 THE CONFUCIAN GENTLEMAN trait of a man who creates order among men. As did the virtue of the Western Chou kings, it places a man at the center of the social order and indicates his ability to conduct a central social function. The Master said, "To practice governing through virtue can be compared to the Pole Star. It remains in its place yet the multitude of stars revolve around it as they pay homage to it." (Analects 2/1) Virtue also attracts people to it in the same way that the virtue of Wen Wang drew people and states to him. The exercise of virtue by the ruler compels people to respond in the proper manner and to take their proper places. The Master said, "Guide them with edicts, keep them in order with punishments, and the people will avoid you and be without shame. Guide them with virtue, keep order among them with ritual, and the people will have a sense of shame and draw near to you." (.Analects 2/3) The gentleman's transforming qualities appear throughout the Analects. He pursues the Way through study and learning of the pat terns of the past and corrects himself through his studies. Conducting himself along the Way, he possesses the standards and personal qualities to govern and bring a troubled world back to its proper course. In short, the gentleman exemplifies the ideal ruler; he is a re-creation of Wen Wang. Chi K'ang-tzu asked Confucius about governing saying, "What do you think if I killed those without the Way to complete those with the Way?" Confucius replied saying, "If you practice governing, why employ killing? When you desire what is good, the people will desire what is good. The virtue of the gentleman is like the wind, while the virtue of lesser men is like the grass. And when the wind blows over the grass, it cannot but bend." (Analects 12/19) This passage probably belongs to a later stratum of the text. Still, it faithfully encapsulates the gentleman's role. When Chi K'ang-tzu asks about governing, the answer he receives is that if a man governs correctly, his personal correctness will lead the people to the same condition. When the gentleman governs, he creates order among the people like the model from which he was fashioned. He evinces a virtue in his actions that is irresistible to those below him. His display of per sonal excellence, his proper behavior and attitude, strike a responsive chord in them. They respond to his presentation of a model by confor</page><page sequence="25">WILLIAM E. SAVAGE 25 ming to his example. This idea of governing through transforming the people, bringing them to their proper places through the presentation of an effective and potent model, is a large part of the gentleman's role. It was thought that this ideal would be effective among the barbarian tribes bordering the Chou states to the East and North. Their simple recognition of a ruler was enough to make them a proper object of his transforming influences.31 From our present perspective, a comparison of the formulations of human worth supporting the Western Chou hereditary elite and the goal of the Confucian program of education reveals their essential similarity. Both present a nobility whose status and personal excellence distinguish them from the remainder of society. They both represent the claims of a nobility that participates in history, enjoys contact with the divine, and performs a central role in the social order. Because of their personal worth, they are suited for the most important of all social func tions; they are capable of preserving social order through governing. Their excellence is often expressed through images of archetypes derived from the past and through a personal correctness that requires submission. The only difference between them is that the hereditary elite inherits these qualities. The Confucian gentleman acquires them through his own efforts as he learns about the past. 31. Analects, 9/14 states, The Master wished to dwell among the nine Eastern barbarian tribes. Someone said, "They are unrefined. How would you deal with that?" The Master said, "If a gentleman dwelled among them, there would be no question of their being unrefined."</page></plain_text>
