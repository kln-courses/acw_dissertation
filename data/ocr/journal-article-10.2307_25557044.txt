<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW WORKS BY ROGER ACKLING, HAMISH FULTON, DAVID TREMLETT AND THOMAS J. COOPER. Orchard Gallery, Derry. 10 January-1 February. Glancing at the 'catalogue' for this exhibition one might be forgiven for presuming that the organisational imperative for the show was the artists age as all four are within a couple of years either side of forty. However upon viewing the actual works more subtle and profound areas of commonalty became discernible. All four artists could be said to inhabit the same, by now 'traditional', conceptual territory, in the main characterised by understate ment, reservedness, and minimal means. All four are involved with intimate personal perceptions to do with the actual experience of place (usually rural) and time. There are two aspects in particular of Hamish Fulton's work that I find questionable. Firstly, I have nowhere yet seen him credit the craftspeople who make and print the frames and texts: craftspeople whose skill is unquestionably an integral part of the art. Secondly, his predilection for grandiose 'statements' embodied in the unduly large scale of the frames. These give the work a false authority and mystique that the otherwise fairly straightforward (though usually exotic) imagery cannot sustain. In this exhibition he showed three photographic works and one piece consisting of text only. This last work, Seven Days Walking And Seven Nights Camping In A Wood Scotland March 1985, reads like a kind of slow chant whose rhythm might echo the activity of walking. From a distance this text, 'Seven Winds, Seven Twigs, Seven Paths,' in widely spaced letters of red, seems to dissolve into its 'environment' in a way reflecting the nature of Fulton's walking art. The text is the record of the invisible pattern of his experience. Meeting Place Of Rivers Crossing Point Of Walks is a 'Richard Long' work without the attendant sculpture present in the image. The cross form, latent in the landscape of the photograph, echoes the crossing walks of the title. In Dranga Jokull a circular photograph perhaps relates to the full-moon referred to in the accompanying text. The circular form of this image is in turn bisected by the (paradoxically) flat summit of the mountain (Dranga Jokull), thereby suggesting the ascent and descent of the mountain. The photograph used in this piece has an almost other worldly feel about it suggesting the moon or the sea rather than a mountain. With this in mind the circular format suddenly becomes a porthole or window and the work's conceptual frame of reference dissolves in ambiguity. With An Eleven Day Road Walk From The North Coast lb The South Coast Of Ireland luly 1985, Fulton exhibited his liking for hanging works at unusual levels to induce empathy with the actual physical position of the object in the photograph. So, the image of an old milestone in an overgrown field was hung close to floor level. With this piece, Fulton, perhaps unwittingly, reinforces the romantic idea of Ireland as a rural idyll of lush meadows and old world charms, untouched by nasty modernity. It seems to me that an image 'representing' such a walk must of necessity avoid such cliches. If these works are anything to go by Fulton needs to somewhat loosen the ideological blinkers framing his world. Thomas J. Cooper is another artist who relies on a strict discipline to hone his work to conceptual precision. However, unlike Fulton his pieces are realised with a delicate subtlety, rich in metaphor and allusion. Also, unlike Fulton, he is deeply anthropomorphic in his perception of landscape. In a work such as The Guardian Cycle ? A Quality of Dancing this anthropomor phism seems straightforward ? forms of plants echo the forms of dancers. However, in another work, Divided, A Premonitional Work Malin Head, Co. Donegal, Ireland 1985 'North Of Derry Is The South", the anthropomorphism involves the subtler realms of memory and perception. The inlets and bays in the three photographs that constitute the</page><page sequence="2">CIRCA 41 piece suggest, through their X form, a conflict of opposites. Rocks rear towards each other while at the centre a small 'island' rock suggests a self threatened by larger forces. Interestingly, the bays and inlets also bring to mind the form of a figure whose head would correspond to the viewer's position vis-a-vis the images. The landscape becomes the viewer's 'body'... the conflict is internal the divisions are of the self. Other works shown relied on a particular mood or feeling latent in the image. With these pieces Cooper relies more completely on the image rather than on the relationship of text and image, and in so doing locates himself more deeply in the genre of 'traditional' landscape photography. The photographs, on their own, become mannered: the work is reduced to effect and as such sacrifices the intelligence of the earlier described pieces, at the altar of aesthetics. In David Tremlett's installation, text also played an important role, that of relating the imagery to the immediate environment, in this case of Derry. I had only ever seen the artist's work reproduced in catalogues and so forth where it appeared to be carefully articulated with particular attention given to the details of the process of mark making and 'finish'. I was not then prepared for the crudity and lack of sensitivity evidenced by the work executed for the small side gallery at the Orchard. The walls, 'painted' light grey, were covered in gestural abstract marks, hesitantly, in places, applied in a fairly random fashion. Five large, door like, black painted rectangles further divided up the space. The whole was then surrounded by a border of brick red colour which, in the area just underneath the ceiling, included the handwritten text, "THOSE ? LITTLE PLACES ? A CORNER ? THE CLARENCE ? TIME ? OF A LIFETIME ? INNER SILENCE ? TIN CAN ? TAKE AWAY ? CATS ? AND DOGS ? CRACK ? A LINE ? BOARDED' ? and back to the start again. This text did not appear to have any kind of relationship to the imagery: they seemed brought together from different worlds in a manner that remained unresolved and unthought through. Somewhere at the heart of this piece was A Good Idea that for some reason or another, was impoverished by a lack of the necessary and appropriate disciplines and skills of image making. The real pleasure and interest in Roger Ackling's work lies 'hidden' until you are told the manner of the art's making. Initially one sees five small pieces of driftwood, each one apparently having been branded with a number of small parallel lines, attached to the wall about eye level. There are no titles, dates, or any other information as to their origin. All one is informed is that "Roger Ackling: born 1947: lives and teaches in London". Out of curiosity I asked how the work had been made and was David Tremlett, installational work at the Orchard Gallery, Derry, 1985. amazed to find that the truth of the matter was in fact very different from my initial perception of it. The 'brands' had been made by using a hand lens to magnify and concentrate sunlight. Each work is the measure of the time and intensity of sunlight on a particular day in a particular place. Each work is evidence of a meditation involving energy, mind and matter. The works shift from being perceived as minor exercises in aesthetics to being understood as a kind of visual Haiku, a subtle poetry directing the mind to consider elemental matters of mind and nature. Anyone visiting the exhibition would most likely not even have begun to 'see' these aspects of the work because it was simply not evident enough from them how they had been created. Providing a subtle insight into the process underlying the pieces would have enhanced the work for everyone and would not at all have compromised its integrity. Finally, it is worth noting that although these artists are concerned with personal perceptions to do with the actual experience of place (usually rural) not once does the human figure appear in the work. Also, for art that purports to be about familiar, ordinary places or events, quiet reflection, and the richness of the natural world it seemed to me that much of the work in this show evidenced inhibition just when such a quality of mind would seem to be least appropriate. Academicism is an everpresent danger in contemporary art, and a little more ideological iconoclasm would not, I feel,' be misplaced in this increasingly conservative period of contemporary art practice.
