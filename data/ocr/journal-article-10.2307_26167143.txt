<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Art + Ecology:  Land Reclamation Works of Artists Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, and Helen Mayer Harrison and Newton Harrison Leslie Ryan Department of Landscape Architecture, University of Oregon; Eugene, OR 97403-5234, leslie@uoregon.edu Post-industrial landscapes present a challenge to traditional means of aesthetic evaluation. This article examines the work of four artists and their contributions to an aesthetic vocabulary that can support art prac- tices that engage places and systems rather than objects. Art presumes a manipulation of materials and places, a significant point for landscape reclamation which also requires a re-making of a site. The land reclama- tion projects and proposals of Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, and Helen Mayer Harrison and Newton Harrison are guides to an aesthetics that expands to include ethical relationships and responsibility for the well- being of the environment and others. The problems of mining are a bit like Humpty Dumpty. In other words, Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall, all the king’s horses and all the king’s men couldn’t put Humpty together again. The idea in mining is that a lot of people would like to put the landscape back together again the way it was, back in the nineteenth century. And of course that won’t happen. But you will be able to perhaps confer a different kind of value through a different kind of cultivation. I think it is possible to cultivate waste, spoil banks, or the cuts in strip-mining areas. It’s a matter of developing a different value structure, and also to have some kind of relationship between the industrial processes and the ecological controls. –Robert Smithson1 In the late Sixties, the environment became subject matter for artists as well as a method of working. Dubbed “Earth Art” or “Land Art,” artists created works that were inseparable from the environment in which they were made: a mile long 1.

The Amer- ican Southwest exerted a particularly strong pull on Earth artists; in the desert, artists found “a place that swallows up boundaries,”3 a vast, silent, intimidating and bewitching canvas for interventions and gestural mark-making on a scale that couldn’t be contained in the context of a gallery or museum space.  Earth art emerged simultaneously with worldwide environmental concerns. Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring (1962) brought the invisible dangers of pesticides to light, and the Apollo 8’s view of earth from space in December 1968 provided an icon for the fragility of the planet. President Nixon formally signed the National Environmental Protection Act in late 1969 in response to public demand for resolutions to sprawling environmental problems. Communities were strug- gling with the legacy of industrialization, as mining operations had polluted waterways with acid mine drainage, whole ecosystems vanished in pit mines or as hillsides eroded, and fertile soil was buried under moonscapes of iron slag and mine tailings. The local effects were most keenly felt when industry and jobs left and what has remained behind were contaminated landscapes, fragmented eco- systems, and social upheaval. When the Earth artists moved out of the studio and into the field, traditional models of defining the aesthetic impulse lost traction. Now the art work might be a coal mine or debris field, the materials be earth or seeds, and the method of working might emerge from entropy or feedback loops. A new aesthetic needed to co-evolve with the change in materials and methods. This essay looks at artists Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, and Helen Mayer Harrison and Newton Harri- son, who, along with critics such as Jack Burnham, laid the initial groundwork for a critical vocabulary that could support an art that engaged places and sys- tems rather than objects. As an ensemble, they have made significant contribu- tions to framing the aesthetic and ethical discourse around landscape reclamation works. Robert Smithson and Robert Morris wrote prolifically about their work and theories, redirecting the aesthetic expectations of the art world in the late 60s and early 70s. Smithson published many essays on what he termed the “dialectics” between place, process, and materials. Since his 1973 death (his airplane crashed during an aerial survey of a potential project site), his work has been the subject of numerous retrospective exhibits, monographs and articles. He is most well known for the iconic Spiral Jetty, set in the briny red water of Utah’s Great Salt 2.  The works are Mile Long Drawing (1968) by Walter De Maria, Double Negative  (1969–70) by Michael Heizer, and Spiral Jetty (1970) by Robert Smithson. 3.

He maintained a long interest in peripheral environments; other art works focused on derelict suburban landscapes, studies of rock and gravel quarries, and proposals for using art to reclaim mining sites. Morris has written a number of essays that highlight significant moments in aesthetic thinking: “Anti Form” (1968) declared the increasing irrelevance of art that depended on preconceived forms; his keynote address for Earthworks: Land Reclamation as Sculpture (1979) outlined the issues of art as it became “public” art and gained function and utility; and “Notes on Art as/and Land Reclamation,” a 1980 rewriting of his key- note address, joined art-making to a contemporary cultural dialogue on politics, post-industrial landscapes, and the ethics of sustainability. In 1979, he built the first landscape reclamation project by an artist in the United States.  Helen Mayer Harrison and Newton Harrison began working with ecosystems and environmental issues in 1970–71 when Newton exhibited Notations on the Ecosystem of the Western Salt Works (with the inclusion of brine shrimp) at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Helen tried, unsuccessfully, to make brine shrimp taste good. This piece (also known as Survival Piece #2), marked the beginning of their decades-long collaboration and their decision to work exclusively with projects that advantaged the life web. Using maps, text, photo- graphs, and performance, the Harrisons have presented their “eco-cultural” visions to public and private agencies and exhibited in galleries and museums worldwide. Their land reclamation proposals have included the Devil’s Gate Debris Basin in Pasadena (1985–90), The Mulde Watershed (1994) and A Brown Coal Park (1995–96), both in eastern Germany. Art presumes a re-forming or manipulation of materials and place, a signifi- cant point for landscape reclamation which also requires a re-making of a site. The artist is expected to resolve aesthetic issues in inventive ways that open up the world, or site, to a new view. The landscape reclamation projects and propos- als of Smithson, Morris, and the Harrisons are examples of how the aesthetic impulses of the art world have expanded beyond form, sensory input, and land- scape appreciation to include ethical relationships and responsibilities for the well-being of the Earth and its inhabitants. Earth Works EARTH WORKS opened in October 1968 in Virginia Dwan’s New York gallery. Ten artists were invited to participate in what would be the first art exhibit to take up earth as subject matter, as material, and as site.4 The engagement with earth was literal, direct, and center stage.  In the middle of the gallery floor was Robert Morris’s Earthwork, a 12-feet diameter haphazard-looking pile of dirt and bricks scavenged from a construction site and combined with industrial grease, felt remnants, and scraps of metal and 4.  Invited artists included Carl Andre, Herbert Bayer, Walter DeMaria, Michael Heizer,  Stephen Kaltenbach, Sol Le Witt, Robert Morris, Claes Oldenburg, Dennis Oppenheim,  and Robert Smithson. </page> <page sequence="4"> 98 LESLIE RYAN  pipe. A few months earlier, in “Anti Form,” an essay published in Artforum, Morris had asked how materials might precede form, rather than follow or sup- port a predetermined form. The configuration of a piece then would result from unplanned juxtapositions or from responses to outside pressure, such as the angle of repose of the soil and grease in Morris’s installation. Morris’s “sympathy for matter” was based on the physicality of the material and its relationship to the subsequent form of a thing. “Disengagement with preconceived enduring forms and orders for things is a positive assertion,” Morris concluded. “It is part of the work’s refusal to continue estheticizing the form by dealing with it as a pre- scribed end.”5 In other words, form in art could be relational and specific to the interactions between a material and its environment.  Robert Smithson, who curated the exhibition with Dwan, installed a recent work, A Nonsite, Franklin, New Jersey (1968). Nonsite consisted of an array of five trapezoidal-shaped painted wood bins filled with large, rough chunks of gray ore that Smithson had gathered from the Franklin Furnace zinc mines in northern New Jersey. Above the bins were five trapezoidal sections of topographical maps of Franklin, along with twenty Instamatic photographs and a descriptive para- graph offering artist-led tours of the site. The retreating sizes of maps recalled diagrams of one point perspective images, but rather than an prescribed view, the information organized a view of what was not seen. Smithson’s series of “Site/Nonsites” grounded a dialectic relationship between the gallery interior and the physical ground outside.6 The sites he selected were post-industrial and transitional, such as mines, quarries, and evapo- rating lake beds. For each nonsite installation in the gallery, Smithson would individually “subtract” up to a ton of rocks from scattered spots on a site, and ship them to his New York studio where he reorganized them into an “abstract reality” of his experience of the site. A dialectic was embedded in the link between site and gallery, here and there, back and forth, seen and not seen.  A nonsite demonstrated what falls out, or between, in the traditional represen- tation of a site through painting, photography, or mapping, recalling the observa- tion made by mathematician and philosopher Alfred Korzybski that “The map is not the territory.” The site was conspicuously absent in the nonsite, which in turn was about what wasn’t there. The work remained open-ended because the quali- ties or apprehension of one inferred the continuing presence of the other. Site/ nonsite works existed in the reverberation between the boundedness of the gal- lery and the site’s resistance to containment. While the site was expansive and approaching boundaries (that it could not possess), the nonsite was a contraction and containment of the site. It “pointed back” to a place, even as it can never be re-placed. “The dialectic can be thought of...as a bipolar rhythm between mind 5.

It’s both. Everything is two things that con- verge.”7 An established conception of “site” shifted dramatically within Smithson’s discourse. It was no longer merely background or support for a discrete art work, in the manner of most sculpture gardens where a wall of green was a ready sub- stitution for the white walls of the museum. Site was also more than an excep- tional canvas for contemporary art interventions. While Smithson was known as an “Earth artist,” these early site/nonsite works differed substantially from the monumental landscapes constructed by contemporaries such as Michael Heizer, who removed 240,000 tons of a desert plateau with dynamite and bulldozers to make Double Negative (1969–70). In Smithson’s aesthetic of site/nonsite, land was a place and an art object as insistent as the bins of rocks that were exhibited in the gallery. Earthworks was also the name of a 1966 science fiction book by British author Brian Aldiss. The story opens with Knowle Noland on his ship, the Trieste Star, transporting his cargo of sand from Africa’s Skeleton Coast to soil manu- facturers in Europe. Technologies and cultural practices had virtually erased the feedback processes of self-organizing systems that naturally regenerate the earth: Trees had been cut down to get rid of the birds, which were currently being destroyed because of their ability to spread crop disease. Now we were building tree-substitutes; they would act as wind-breaks, as the trees had done, and stop the wind from blowing away the soil and exposing more subsoil.8 The effects of fragmenting the systems that made and maintained soil were far- reaching. Soil has become a rare and invaluable commodity in Noland’s world. Food is scarce and strictly controlled, the air is filled with poisonous dust used to control plagues of pests, and everyday life is consumed with often futile attempts to fulfill basic needs. Survival depends on the presence of, and interactions with, others in an environment, and in the absence of mediating bio-systems, natural processes like wind and gravity and the free movement of species function to the detriment of human survival, rather than to advantage.  7.

On the ride from the Port Authority bus terminal, Smithson read a newspaper review of Samuel F.B. Morse’s Allegorical Land- scape (1835–36), an idealized landscape painting with faded “’Gothic’ build- ings” and a sky of “subtle newsprint grey.” Although the newspaper caption truncates the name of the painting, the full title was Allegorical Landscape of New York University. In the painting, Morse relocated New York University’s University building from its Washington Square address in Manhattan to a pasto- ral setting that recalled Claude Lorrain’s classical landscapes. Morse used the idealistic lens of an imagined, Arcadian past to lend a historical continuity to the contemporary cultural monuments of the early nineteenth-century United States; Smithson noted the critic’s proclamation that the painting could “stand confi- dently” as a representative of the “high ideals that universities foster.”10 Figure 1 Bridge over the Passaic River (photograph Kenneth Helphand, 1995). 9.

His odyssey skirted around the edges of town, along the river, past construc- tion sites, and across the forlorn wastelands that inhabited the fringe areas of town. With Morse’s allegorical landscape at hand, Smithson remapped Passaic as the “new Rome,” a “kind of self-destroying postcard world of failed immortality and oppressive grandeur.”11 Passaic’s contemporary and post-industrial monu- ments—outfall pipes spewing effluent into the Passaic river, a steel swing span bridge rotating to allow passage of barges carrying “unknown cargo,” a pumping derrick located mid-river—replaced the public fountains, arched bridges, and aqueducts of ancient Rome. Smithson’s travelogue introduced a shift in the aes- thetic view from the road and walk. The change originated with seeing the world as it is, rather than looking for the one that was promised. Smithson’s work was concurrent with a growing environmental awareness in the United States. His personal library included several books on environmental topics, such as Ecology in Design; Design, Nature, and Revolution: Toward a Critical Ecology; and The Environmental Crisis.12 He would have been aware of Rachel Carson’s book; it had been published first as a series in the weekly New Yorker magazine, and as New York art critic Grace Glueck affirmed, “Of course I read Silent Spring—everyone did.”13 Smithson, however, was no environmen- talist interested in “getting back to nature.” “A good deal of ecology strikes me as nostalgia,” he would write, “for a view of the landscape that at one time existed. It’s like a yearning for the unspoiled paradise garden, the Eden.”14 An example of Smithson’s non-nostalgia for Nature as paradise was Asphalt Rundown which he executed on the outskirts of Rome a year after the EARTH WORKS exhibition. A truckload of hot asphalt was dumped down the slope of a flint quarry, fanning out and flowing along crevices and channels. His objective was to “root it to the contour of the land, so that it’s permanently there and subject to the weathering,” adding, “I’m sort of curious to see what will happen to this.”15 Smithson found aesthetic value in barren wastelands and dynamited hillsides which showed the marks of time and use. The inevitability of entropic change, often over vast, geological time scales, fascinated him. “The earth is built on sed- imentation and disruption,” he wrote in 1968. “By refusing ‘technological mira- 11.

It was independent of a specific history or idealization that attempted to conservatively bind place and time. “Scenic ideals,” he declared, “are carriers of a nostalgia for heavenly bliss and eternal calmness.”17 The post- card view muted the dialectic between human action and a continually-made nature, and ignored the real ground of a place, its immediate history and unique character. According to Smithson, the longing for an ideal picture of the world was a roadblock to landscape reclamation. “Because of the great tendency toward idealism,” he would later write, we are “confused as to what to do with such places” as “slag heaps, strip mines, and polluted rivers” that don’t, or won’t, con- form to an expected aesthetic.18 A 1972 exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art provided Smith- son with a model and means to expand an aesthetic vocabulary that could face the landscapes of everyday life, the wastelands, ruins, and marginal places. “Fre- derick Law Olmsted’s New York” was held during the Centennial celebration for the national parks system. Included in the exhibition were early photographs of Central Park before Olmsted and Calvert Vaux’s Greensward Plan for Central Park was implemented. The images showed goats roaming over garbage heaps and rocky outcroppings delimited by muddy depressions; as Smithson noted, the site was “treeless and barren, it evokes the observations of ‘the valley of ashes’ in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby (1925), ‘where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens.’”19 In Olmsted’s transformation of the site from deforested wasteland to sylvan park, Smithson saw an example of an “earth sculpture” that emerged from a dia- lectic between ecological and social processes. Olmsted was greatly influenced by English landscape theorists Uvedale Price and William Gilpin, calling them “professional touchstones” and insisting that all new “pupils” arriving at his doorstep study their writings.20 Following Olmsted’s injunction, Smithson dis- covered an aesthetic relationship between Price’s early nineteenth-century description of the picturesque and his own explanation of an entropic landscape that is restructured over time: The side of a smooth green hill, torn by floods, may at first very properly be called deformed, and on the same principle, though not with the same impression, as a 16.

When a rawness of such a gash in the ground is softened, and in part concealed and ornamented by the effects of time, and the progress of vegetation, deformity, by this usual process, is converted into picturesqueness; and this is the case with quarries, gravel pits, etc., which at first are deformities, and which in their most picturesque state, are often considered as such by a leveling improver.21 Olmsted had used the potential of the picturesque to dialectically join the con- tradictions of natural processes and transform “deformities” into socially relevant places. The picturesque was synonymous with time: the time it takes for a tree to grow or a rock to weather, the time it takes to heal a wound, and the time it takes for a walk around the lake. “The picturesque, far from being an inner movement of the mind, is based on real land,” Smithson claimed.22 And the picturesque qualities of Olmsted’s park sprang from such “real” particulars—from outsized boulders of glacial-scoured schist and an undulating topography of stone and earth, to the need to direct vehicular traffic and fulfill an agenda for social reform —as well as from the physical experience of a continuously unfolding view. The landscapes of everyday life, a contemporaneousness that didn’t attempt to erase or deny a past (or a future), and an inquiry into process and place that “related to chance and change in the material order of nature” formed the basis of Smith- son’s aesthetic of the entropic landscape.23 Much as Morris had argued for a “sympathy with matter,” Smithson was proposing a sympathy with the land- scapes that shadowed everyday contemporary life. Systems Aesthetics In the eyes of our critics the ozone hole above our heads, the moral law in our hearts, the autonomous text, may each be of interest, but only separately. That a delicate shuttle should have woven together the heavens, industry, texts, souls and moral law – this remains uncanny, unthinkable, unseemly. –Bruno Latour24 During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the critical edge for many artists was in fields of technologies and science. Art practices were framed by new comprehen- sions of human/nature interactions and perceptions, and artists expanded their inquiries into fields of biology, geology and ecology, as well as cognitive science and information theories. A primary theorist in this regard was Jack Burnham, an artist, art critic, and professor of art at Northwestern University. In his essay, 21.  Ibid., 159. A “leveling improver” was someone who “improved” a landscape by  changing the topography of a site. 22.  Ibid., 160. 23.  Ibid., 159. 24.  Bruno Latour, We Have Never Been Modern, trans.

Systems aesthetics evaluated art works on their engagement with process, interaction, attention to feedback and information networks, and capacity to cir- cumvent the formal autonomy of the object. The specific function of these new art practices, Burnham declared, was to “show that art does not reside in mate- rial entities, but in relations between people and between people and the compo- nents of their environment.” The introduction of systems into the aesthetic discourse opened up space for networks and the interdependency of ecosystems to inform art practices. Using the perspective of systems, a framework for a “crit- ical vocabulary” was established around contemporary art practices that were “unobjects”: things without spatial or temporal boundaries, such as environ- ments, ephemeral and recursive events and elements. “We are now in transition from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture,” wrote Burnham. “Here change emanates, not from things, but from the way things are done.”25 Burn- ham’s aesthetic was a form of inquiry into what wasn’t present, into the condi- tions that led to an emergent event, and into the information required in order to negotiate a situation. Burnham illustrated his theory with examples of art that reacts to its environ- ment, such as Rain Tree by Hans Haacke; the artist documented the patterns of water dripping from the edges of a tree canopy, and so mapped information, the “invisible components of systems.”26 Burnham commented on several Robert Morris sculptural pieces. One was Untitled (L-Beams) (1966) which consisted of three right-angled forms that were constructed from instructions that the artist had mailed to the construction crew at the museum. “Information” could be said to have made the art work, rather than the artist’s hand. Another was Earth Project, a proposal for the sculptural manipulation of a landfill in Evanston, Illi- nois which required the artist to work closely with information from others out- side the art world, such as surveyors, engineers, and geologists.27 The image of the artists working alone with only the work at hand disintegrated when the infor- mation of systems thinking became an operative metaphor for the aesthetic guidelines used to both conceptualize or actualize an art work.  Burnham spent the following academic year (1968–69) as a fellow at Gyorgy Kepes’s Center for the Advancement of Visual Studies at MIT. The exposure to the computing systems at MIT accentuated Burnham’s interest in information technologies and artificial intelligence, although Burnham would give up further pursuit of the theory soon after a mixed reception for his 1970 exhibition Soft- 25.

Technologies and systems dis- plays did not work properly; the gerbils that inhabited Nicholas Negroponte’s Seek, a “computer-controlled robotic environment,” created a rodent’s version of Survivor, and the museum trustees censored the exhibition catalog, among other problems.28 It may have been that the contemporary political climate hampered acceptance of Burnham’s propositions. While systems thinking describes ecolo- gies of the environment, the social, and the mind, the most frequent application during this period was made by engineers and strategists who worked either directly or indirectly for the military. The essay had arrived on newsstands in September 1968 as furor over environmental degradation fomented and escalat- ing protests against the war in Vietnam were on the nightly news. New technolo- gies and techniques using systems thinking or systems analysis were typically developed in think tanks like the RAND Corporation, a research and develop- ment institution that provided the military with technological expertise on mis- siles, spacecraft, and nuclear technology throughout the Vietnam and Cold War years. Smithson, for one, wasn’t optimistic about technology’s value to art. In a 1969 letter to Kepes, Smithson explained the withdrawal of his work from the 1969 São Paulo Biennale. “Some Brazilians see the ‘advances’ of technology as a military byproduct,” he wrote, concluding with the suggestion that “If technol- ogy is to have any chance at all it must become more self-critical...A panel called ‘What’s Wrong with Technological Art’ might help.”29 In 1969, Smithson, Morris and Newton Harrison were invited to participate in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s “Art and Technology” program. Museum curator Maurice Tuchman set up the program with the intention of pair- ing artists with corporations and research institutions. The institutions were to provide work space and access to scientific expertise to artists who wanted to work with advanced technologies. Among Tuchman’s corporate contacts were the RAND Corporation, Lockheed, IBM, General Electric, and Teledyne; thirty- seven corporations participated in the four year long project. Smithson and Mor- ris made proposals, but neither were able to develop a mutually satisfactory rela- tionship with the scientists and researchers. Smithson presented two proposals, one to Kaiser Steel to make a sculpture consisting of an undulating sheet of tin (“as long as possible”) laid over heaps of iron slag, and another to American Concrete that called for a “dearchitectured project” that would construct, then demolish and display a concrete building.30 Morris wanted to study environmen- tal controls; his proposal to Lear Siegler Inc. was to install industrial-capacity air 28.

Lear backed out as potential costs expanded.31 Harrison was able to establish a beneficial working relationship with the engi- neers at Pasadena’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He began with a question that needed scientific input in order to find an answer: how can light be used for field painting, and more specifically, how can fields of light float and freely occupy space? He engaged the researchers in a serious exchange on glow discharge dis- plays, formed by ionized gas, or plasma, which emits light when under pressure and exposed to the potential difference between two electrodes. His Encapsu- lated Aurora (1970), shown at the 1970 Expo in Osaka, Japan, and in Tuchman’s 1971 “Art and Technology” exhibit in Los Angeles, was programmed to admit pre-determined amounts of gases into plexiglass tubes, creating luminous, living fields of color and light that responded to the presence of viewers.32 Scientific and artistic inquiries found common ground in the conversational process that developed between Harrison and the engineers in the laboratory. The art work changed to fit the information provided by the scientists rather than fishing for the science that could support a preconceived form; correspondingly, the plasma physicists, intrigued by Harrison’s “stretching” of plasma and imagining its application to space travel, commenced their own experiments into how plasma worked at larger scales. Making Earth After the technology-intensive plasma works, Harrison entered what he calls a “counter-argument with myself,” and his succeeding works were decidedly low- tech. Coincidentally taking up the premise of Earthworks, the “eco-disaster” sci- ence fiction book that Smithson carried on his walk through Passaic, Harrison made earth, in his own backyard and with his wife Helen Mayer Harrison. While other Earth artists were moving mountains, the Harrisons began to pay attention to the systems that created the mountain. “We did not consider it either interesting or valuable to use earth to make forms on unusual sites,” Helen com- mented, referring to the massive projects by Earth artists who worked with earth as if it were an inert substance.33 Making Earth (1970) emerged as the Harrisons were thinking of survival as the subject matter of art, and decided to begin the exploration with their immediate environment. Kitchen waste was layered with sand, sewage sludge, manure, sawdust and clay, and turned each day for one half hour. “In an alchemical fashion we mix sterile and separately hostile elements, where the mixture combines with time and our touch, becoming literally a living element, a medium for growth,” they wrote in a 1972 letter to Jack Burnham.34 31.

The learning process embedded in the combining and turning that made earth informed an ensemble of Survival Pieces that the Harrisons created during the 1970s. The series, which included portable orchards, worm farms, and catfish tanks, focused on farming and food production, actions that clearly depend on living soil and clean water. Making Earth was also a critique of the literal death of the earth as an eroded, contaminated, leached of nutrients and increasingly stressed organism. As cul- tural concerns rose for “maintaining the biological livability of the earth” and “establishing priorities for the usage and conservation of natural resources,” Burnham had predicted that the interest in formal art objects would give way to art with an aesthetic base in systems thinking.35 Art as a product or object cer- tainly had become increasingly irrelevant to the Harrisons. Earth wasn’t the medium for another message, but was the thing-in-itself. The action of making earth deepened the Harrisons’ comprehension of living systems and grounded their future work with land reclamation projects. The Harrisons continued their questioning into how bad earth is made good in a later work at Artpark in Lewiston, New York. With their son Joshua, they pro- posed to regenerate the earth in a forty-acre site on the Artpark grounds. Spoils Pile Reclamation Project (1977–78) was anticipated as a three-year work to reclaim land and establish a healthy environment. It began with the dumping of three thousand truck loads of soil and organic matter on the sterile ground; over the coming years, the land would be reclaimed, using natural processes of decay, decomposition and growth. Planting began with a few native trees and seeds col- lected by local Girl and Boy Scouts, however, work on the project was stopped after the second year, when Artpark enforced a rule against permanent construc- tions at the park site. The Harrisons’ focus was the earth’s potential to self-gener- ate and support ecological systems without large investments in technological infrastructure. They were constructing the foundation for a succession ecology to take hold, understanding that in its early stages, the landscape would look “ratty” as Newton Harrison has put it. The question was how an unkempt and weedy- looking landscape could be reframed as an aesthetic choice.  The Harrisons’ method of reclamation at Artpark recognized the dictionary meaning of “reclamation” as a “calling or bringing back from wrong-doing.”36 They reframed land reclamation as a caring for or tending to, but, most signifi- cantly, as a response to misdeeds of the past. Reclamation projects frequently cover up an exploitative history with a layer of clay or HDPE plastic. An exam- ple, also from Artpark, is Alan Sonfist’s Pool of Virgin Earth (1975). Sonfist 34.

New ecologies may have sprouted, but the growth would have been confined to a thin dressing that skimmed the surface and offered a temporary, visual solution to a deeper, more complex problem. A site that was “embedded...with twentieth century debris” may have “had esthetic potential,” as the 1977 brief for Artpark phrased it, but it was also bio- logically diminished earth.37 It was an ethical act to aid in the repair of earth that had been used as a quarry, a railroad bed and a dump site for construction debris. Ethics in art, suggests critic Charles Green, is “a way of making others present.”38 The Harrisons had decided early in their collaboration that they would “do no work that did not address and take responsibility for the bio- sphere.”39 Attending to “others” in their work would start with advantaging that which had been disadvantaged, and speaking up for what is by nature silent. Holding their work responsible for improving and maintaining the welfare of the biosphere expanded the concept of “other” to include trees, rocks, soil, and water. In the Harrisons’ work, aesthetics would be present in the resultant well-being of the environment and its inhabitants. Disused Land Pay attention to the cost of belief. –Helen Mayer Harrison and Newton Harrison40 Robert Morris’s Untitled, Johnson Pit #30 (1979) is a large-scale reclamation of an abandoned gravel pit in southern King County, Washington. Morris re-formed the amorphous pit into concentric terraces that descended from a sloping surface down into the earth, resembling a topographical model and following the angle of repose of soil and rock. Trees that hadn’t been removed during the years of gravel operations were either cut back or taken out. As seen in the starkness of early black and white photographs, the work could have handily illustrated Dante’s Inferno—fifteen tar-covered stumps limning the newly scraped gravel and earth terraces, bulldozer tracks still visible in the foreground, the distant view disappearing in thick fog—but then, pastoral beauty or ecological well-being 37.

Noting that there were over one hundred publicly-owned mining sites located within the county and “many more” privately-owned “scars that dot the landscape,”42 the Arts Commission negotiated a partnership of sorts between the National Endowment for the Arts, the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the Bureau of Mines to underwrite Morris’s art work.43 The energy crisis of the early 1970s in combination with public support for reclaiming brownfield sites had helped push the passage of bills like the Federal Surface Mining Control and 41.

The King County Earthworks project was one of the first agen- cies in the U.S. to receive public funding for a land reclamation project by an art- ist.  One early precedent for the King County art and land reclamation projects was the post-mining proposals of Robert Smithson. In the years before his death in 1973, Smithson focused on proposals for “recycling disused land masses,” most specifically mining sites, as art projects.44 He sent specific proposals to the Hanna Coal Company (Lake Edge Crescents, Egypt Valley, Ohio, 1972); Ken- nebeck Copper Corporation (Bingham Copper Mining Pit, Utah, Reclamation Project, Bingham, Utah, 1973); Minerals Engineering Company (Tailing Pond, First Stage, Creede, Colorado, 1973); and visited or contacted dozens of other potential reclamation sites.45 In a proposal to the Hanna Coal Company, Smith- son argued for artists, scientists and industrialists to openly collaborate on projects and so link aesthetic values with the fulfillment of socio-economic needs and the mending of fragmented landscapes.46 He imagined art as a mediator between the science of ecology and the economy of industry, and that miners and ecologists could approach their work in a way similar to Olmsted’s, that is, by inventing ways to simultaneously create an aesthetically worthwhile place while still using the land to support human needs.47 “The world needs coal and high- ways,” Smithson said, we just “do not need the results of strip mining or highway trusts.”48 A mining ethics based on a purposeful aesthetic would pay attention to the forms of the process as they were generated, rather than wait for the artist to bestow aesthetic value after the fact. He suggested a potentially symbiotic rela- tionship between ethics and aesthetics; the aesthetic power of a place could be linked to an ethical practice through mindful engagement and acceptance of the site for what it was at each phase of its unmaking or restoration. Broken Circle/Spiral Hill (1971) is Smithson’s only land reclamation pro- posal to be realized. Broken Circle is a 140-foot diameter circle of alternating flat planes and narrow spits of water and white sand, each half a mirrored or doubled 44.

It is located in a sand quarry a short distance from the town of Emmen in the Netherlands. The companion to Broken Circle is Spiral Hill, a spiraling “spoils mound” of excavated material that provides access to views across the quarry landscape. Broken Circle/Spiral Hill was commissioned for Sonsbeek ’71, an international arts festival, but its popularity with the public and proximity to town encouraged the city to maintain it as a permanent part of a local park. “The best sites for ‘earth art’ are sites that have been disrupted by industry, reckless urbanization or nature’s own devastation,” Smithson wrote, adding that other peripheral landscapes like the Dutch quarry could be “culti- vated or recycled as art.”49 Morris gave the keynote address to the 1979 symposium for Earthworks: Land Reclamation as Sculpture in King County. His discussion wove through the motives and aesthetics of earthworks, especially when seen as public art. He was skeptical about use and function becoming part of the definition of successful art in the public realm. His recently completed work for the Arts Commission was a permanent, publicly owned, publicly accessible, and publicly used art work. However, he noted, public art is often “entertainment rated G” art—sweet, whim- sical, and characterized by “middle-brow policies of bringing the mediocre to the many.”50 His address attempted to set out the aesthetic terms for earthworks that may be public, but are not mediocre. Morris traced two critical aesthetic elements of earthworks: the formal ele- ments, such as space, scale, and the time as needed to apprehend a work; and “transformal” elements that included weather and other phenomena, viewing the work from inside the work, time as experience and narrative, and other site fac- tors that could not be “whited out” by the gallery walls. Adding to Smithson’s proposal for a mining ethic based on aesthetics, Morris says there are “moral questions” as well as aesthetic issues that emerge from how these formal and transformal elements are used. What does it mean if the artist removes or covers up the industrial scars and wounds of the earth? Is art then wiping away “techno- logical guilt” and thereby “socially redeeming those who wasted the landscape in the first place”? Will artists become the apologists for industrial waste cleanup? What happens if degraded or contaminated landscapes are re-considered to be “more like long awaited aesthetic possibilities”?51 These questions that Morris raised weren’t rhetorical. In the foreword to the symposium catalog, Yankee Johnson, then executive director of the Arts Commission, laid out two successes expected for the project: “On the one hand the commission would enlist artists to prepare proposals for earthworks that would introduce the work of contemporary artists to the Northwest. On the other hand earthworks would be employed as a 49.  Smithson, “Frederick Law Olmsted and the Dialectical Landscape (1973),” in Robert  Smithson: The Collected Writings, 165. 50.

Art is immanently political, either confirming the status quo by covering up or ignoring a situation, or exposing the belief system that supports socially and ecologically destructive actions. The hellish image of blackened tree stumps and raw contours that Morris made in Untitled is appropriate when viewed as a “protest against the escalating use of nonrenewable minerals and energy sources,” as he would write the following year.54 But potential landscape recla- mation projects are seldom the sites of such protests. The Kennebeck Copper Mine, the world’s largest copper mine and site of one of Smithson’s proposals, was declared a National Historic Monument in 1978. This was a boon to mining industrialists who estimated that to restore the mine to an approximation of its original condition would take 66 years of moving 400,000 tons of soil and rock per day (presumably from another mountain) and would cost $7 billion, but a puzzling monument from other points of view.55 “What earthwork should even be compared to it?” as Morris asked. “It should stand unregenerate as a powerful monument to a one-day nonexistent resource.”56 Works like Morris’s Untitled (1979) or Smithson’s Broken Circle were recla- mation projects that didn’t repair the land or restore a landscape as a functioning ecosystem, but reclaimed it, or renamed it, in the name of art. “Our ecological awareness indicates that industrial production can no longer remain blind to the visual landscape,” said Smithson.57 Both artists were interested in how art could re-value “disused land masses” through interventions that significantly empha- sized the visual and the re-entry of devastated landscapes back into an everyday environment. In contrast, the Harrisons’ work in post-mining landscapes, while not blind to the visual composition of a site or the power of an image, has focused on taking up ecological well-being as subject matter for art. Their aesthetic con- cerns have more in common with “the survival of natural systems than with the survival of art.”58 Since the early 1990s, the Harrisons have received a number of invitations to investigate the ecological and cultural problems that have resulted from mining 52.

One proposal for the reclama- tion of a mining site was for the Tagebau Witznitz, a ten square kilometer brown coal open-pit mine located outside the small town of Borna, south of Leipzig in the former East Germany. At Witznitz, both the human and non-human inhabit- ants were displaced by coal extraction—Witznitz was the name of the original village that was demolished to make room for coal extraction—and finding means to reinvent a lost network of communities was elemental to the artistic process. The artists’ first proposal suggested relatively modest changes to the engineer’s plans: leave half of the mine as previously designed, but on the other half, “fold” the topography to maximize edge conditions and so increase proba- bility for bio-diversity of plant and animal life. A variety of soils would be added to specific areas so that an array of succession ecologies could develop; the site would thus become a laboratory that could guide reclamation schemes for future mining sites. The artists imagined educational and scientific advantages, as dif- ferences in topography and soils would create conditions for “varied comparative biotope studies on the same site.”59 Figure 3 Tagebau Witznitz (photograph author, 1995). The area around the Tagebau Witznitz is dotted with mining pits; building on what they knew of this landscape through their previous work on the Mulde watershed and the Bitterfeld coal mines in Germany, the Harrisons saw that each local mine was an point of entry into a larger field that lay outside (or under- neath) vision. This observation became the concept for an expanded proposal to their clients. Taking the extent of the earth that had been turned, or would be 59.

The park would follow “the shape of brown coal” and contain a three hundred square kilometer landscape that had a vaguely anthropomorphic outline with Leipzig at the head and Witznitz at the left hip. The park would incorporate farms, towns, industry, and the inevitable lakes that form as pit mines gradually fill with groundwater and runoff. A 140-kilometer long route would outline the subterranean coal fields and cross the political bor- ders that fragment ecological boundaries. In walking or driving, it would be pos- sible to physically experience the field of coal and simultaneously see it as a system with its own rules of engagement.

Ecological boundaries rarely coincide with political borders or economic structures. The Harrisons speak of “scanning” the environment for salient information. They learned from systems studies that information can come from any direction, and that the first step in knowing a place is looking for boundaries and recognizing patterns. Paying attention to the edges that contain the ecological coherence of a place, and listen- ing to the voices of local inhabitants, both human and non-human, is at the core of their process. Future Landscapes ...the frightening problems are the ones that really need investigation. –Robert Smithson60 Since 1996 when A Brown Coal Park was published, the Harrisons’ work has steadily turned to focus on global climate change. Their first work on the green- house effect, San Diego at the Center of the World, was completed in 1974, but until recently there has been little outside interest and few invitations to take up the subject matter. Current research, films like An Inconvenient Truth, and publi- cations such as the Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have shifted the balance, however, and the Harrisons are presently occupied with a series of “Greenhouse” works. In Britain they have received a large grant to pursue Greenhouse Britain – an array of lectures and exhibitions that redraw the map of England as ice caps melt and ocean waters rise. An island country like Great Britain is acutely vulnerable to changes in water levels, as entire towns will be displaced and infrastructures disrupted when coastal and low-lying land is submerged. With the assistance of local scientists, academics, environmental designers and planners, the Harrisons are imagining new settlements built with conviviality and affection, in a “graceful” withdrawal to high ground as water advances.61 Environmentalist Bill McKibben recently wrote a short essay titled “Imagine That: What the Warming World Needs Now is Art, Sweet Art.”62 In it he pro- poses that art is the register that allows a thing to be embodied and to seep into the structure of culture. Art mirrors how we feel about a thing or place. “Art,” he writes, “is one of the ways we digest what is happening to us, make the sense out of it that proceeds into action.” Art turns the conceptual into material phenomena 60.

It enables us to actually see or comprehend the things that are otherwise too big to grasp, like the systems of the greenhouse effect (or the ubiquity of post-industrial landscapes) that are “happening everywhere at once...(threatening) to become backdrop, context, instead of event.”63 The meta- phors and poetic turns of art have the potential to help us shift existing paradigms that are working to the disadvantage of the life web. The work of artists like Smithson, Morris, and the Harrisons, while individu- ally very different in terms of style and process, has considerations in common that bear on the aesthetic discourse around landscape reclamation. Aesthetics are both intentional and emergent; Smithson and Morris argue for the importance of intentionality and the artist’s conception, while the Harrisons’ view of a “long now” prefigures their expectation of an emergent aesthetics that arises from a network of influences. An environmental aesthetics acknowledges systems and connections that extend far beyond the picture plane. Smithson’s “mining eth- ics,” Morris’s protest against resource extinction, and the Harrisons’ eco-cultural approach are each concerned with the aesthetic, ethical, and ecological losses that occur when roles and objectives are fragmented, specialized, or isolated. “An aesthetic exists always in interaction with, and in commentary on, a larger social context,” Helen Harrison said in a 1982 interview. “Since everything depends on everything else, you cannot separate aesthetic values from a larger context.”64 The reframing of environmental aesthetics to include everyday, peripheral landscapes, rather than aspiring solely to the inherited ideal of paradise, permits the weediness of succession ecologies as well as the necessity of mines, quarries, and logged landscapes. Honest appraisals of the landscape-at-hand can lead to reclamations that openly recognize our communal responsibility for the use of the environment. The landscapes we make today are the landscapes inherited by future generations. The caring built into aesthetics can help nurture an empathy for those inhabitants who will live with the reclamation projects of today. While Smithson, Morris, and the Harrisons all take aesthetics to be linked to caring about the environment we inhabit, the Harrisons’ work takes this responsibility even further, declaring that simply pointing out the problem, as Morris did with the gravel pit in Washington, is insufficient to the problem. The next crucial step is to work towards resolving the conditions—and rethinking the belief system— that created such landscapes.  63.   Ibid. 64.  Auping, Common Ground, 99. </page> </plain_text>
