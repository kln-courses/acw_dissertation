Indiana University, 1972 ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of employing a typology for categorization of statements about aesthetic response, and to relate these categories to amount of art training and the psychological meaning of art objects and their components. The typology was developed from the early work of Edward Bullough and consisted offive categories: Objective, Physiological, Character, Associative, and Extrinsic. Ninety seven college students were tested, of these, 33 were elementary education majors, 31 were undergraduate art education majors, and 33 were graduate students working toward advanced degrees in art education. All subjects were given a questionnaire to determine the number of hours of college art training that each had taken. A battery of three tests was then administered. The tests consisted of a color response test, in which a like-dislike decision was made for each of ten single colors and reasons for each preference were given, an art object response test, which elicited similar information about two paintings and components of those paintings, and a seven point bipolar test for responding to the paintings. Data were analyzed using content analysis, Pearson Product Moment Correlation, t tests, and analysis of variance. The results are as follows: 1. The typology is a feasible instrument for categorizing aesthetic response statements. A total of 96.4 per cent of the statements fell into the proposed categories. 2. Statements made in response to single colors correlated significantly with those made in response to art objects and components of art objects. 3. Graduate art education majors produced a significantly greater number of Physiological statements in response to single colors than did elementary education majors. 4. The tendency to make Physio logical statements in response to single colors correlated positively with art training. 5. Elementary education majors produced a significantly greater number of Character statements in response to art objects than did art education graduate students. 6. There was a negative correlation between the tendency to make Character statements in response to art objects and art training. 7. There was little or no significant difference 71 RRVEE</page><page sequence="2">between categories in the use of semantic space along three dimensions: Activity, Potency and Evaluative. On the basis of these findings, it was concluded that: 1. It appears that similar responses can be elicited by both art objects and single colors. Should this finding be verified by subsequent research, the implication for research technique in the area of aesthetic response statements is important, in that such research would be greatly simplified by the use of single colors rather than actual art objects or reproductions. 2. Traditional college art programs do not increase the students tendency to discuss either single colors or art objects in an objective manner. 3. College art training appears to decrease the tendency to attribute anthropomorphic qualities to art objects. 4. College art training appears to increase the tendency to respond to colors in a physical sense, particularly in respect to hot and cold sensations. 5. Individuals displaying strong tendencies toward responding to visual stimuli in any one of the five categories do not appear to differ to any large extent in their response to the psychological meaning to art objects, as measured by the semantic differential. An expanded and refined typology also resulted from the study. REVIEW Marilyn Zurmuehlen University of Iowa Statement of the problem. Arnold clearly indicates his interest in utilizing Bullough's four perceptive types as categories for classifying aesthetic response statements. It should be noted that later he adds a fifth category, Extrinsic, to include those statements which he could not designate as Objective, Physiological, Associative, or Character. He postulates a break down in communication between teachers and students in regard to aesthetic responses, stating: 4It should be apparent that difficulties in communication concerning aesthetic matters exist between those indivi duals who have had training in art and those who have not' (p. 7). If verbalization concerning aesthetic matters includes talk about students' artistic expressions or productions, then it would be appropriate to consider BeittePs^'^ participant-observer dialogues with students untrained 72 RRVEE</page><page sequence="3">in art. These seem to be models of considerable communication between student and teacher. The reader should note that the publication date of one of Beittel's references is later than the date of Arnold's dissertation. However, Beittel's work is mentioned not as a critical omission, but rather to support the reviewer's position that perhaps 'breakdown in communi cation' (p. 6) is a rather strong conclusion to derive from the cited studies which reveal that art training tended to increase formal responses to aesthetic stimuli and that individuals trained and untrained in art frequently have different aesthetic preferences. The lack of evidence available to substantiate this particular claim cer tainly does not detract from the value of verifying such a category system for aesthetic responses. It could be useful in clarifying relationships with other variables or as Arnold employs it, to explore a possible association with amount of art training. To the reviewer it seems that, in attempting to establish the significance of this aspect of the study, the writer may have arrived at a confusion of cause and effect. He asserts: 'Should a relationship between type of verbalization and degree of art training be found, a basis for developing programs to change verbalization and to increase sophistication of response could be structured' (p. 10). It may be he is not advocating that changing verbalization will effect the same change in persons as does training in art, but if he is not, then he appears to be suggesting that one of the goals of art education should be to develop the semblance of art training in those not schooled in art. Surely, Child's^ experience with training children to exhibit agreement with the aesthetic preferences of experts and then discovering that the children's reasons for their decisions often were quite different than those of the experts, indicates the need for caution in making inferences about the internalization of values. Perhaps this is not his meaning, but rather his intent may be to develop programs to change aesthetic responses and to use the category system to measure such changes as they are manifested in writing. One can only deal with the statement as it appears, however. This issue is much deeper than semantic quibbling. Programs to change aesthetic responses not only should be very different from programs to change writing styles, but the two approaches are rooted in quite disparate value systems. A program to change aesthetic responses also raises ethical and educational questions. For one, it assumes some sort of hierarchy among the categories of responses. Although Bullough^ asserted that the aesthetic evaluation of the four perceptive types presented 73 RRVEE</page><page sequence="4">no difficulty and proceeded to demonstrate his statement by ranking them from the lowest, the position in which he placed the Physiological, to the Associative, followed by the Objective, and culminating in the Character as the highest, it is uncertain that his values would evoke substantial agreement among present researchers. Indeed, one might infer that Arnold operates from a different ranking premise when he states, '...it seems very strange indeed that individuals who are highly trained in art respond in a manner that is similar in objectivity to those with almost no training' (p. 95). He also indicates that he would disagree with Bullough's evaluation of the Character type when he observes: 'Such a statement indicates that an anthropomorphic quality has been attributed to the object. This type of response appears to be rather naive,' and further, \..it is doubtful that those individuals with art training would tend to make such responses, since they have probably learned that such responses are considered naive, if not childlike' (p. 96). Bullough's hierarchy may be judged as deductive or as arbitrary, probably as a function of one's agree ment or disagreement with it. In either case its validity has not been established. This problem might be remedied by using agreement with experts as the basis for the ranking of categories. However, both proce dures are open to charges of elitism. Thus, the reviewer would be much more sympathetic to a case for significance to the field of art education which is based on providing teachers with a tool which might give them insights into the aesthetic response systems within which each of their students functions. Arnold's choice of a semantic differential as a means of eliciting data for comparison with the perceptive types, not only presents the opportunity for exploring another relationship, it may have an additional value. Because of the semantic differential's widespread use with visual stimuli an association established with it could contribute credence to the Bullough category system. This would seem a sufficient reason for including the comparison in the research problem; however, the writer maintains that should such a relationship be discovered, '...art educators would have a basis for directing students toward desired behaviors in this area' (p. 10). Perhaps. Or they might have a basis for talking with students about art objects in ways that are most meaningful to the students. Since Bullough's perceptive types were based on tests he conducted with colors, sometimes single and on other occasions in combinations, one is 74 RRVEE</page><page sequence="5">tempted to infer that this is the reason for Arnold's interest in testing responses to single colors, although he does not state it. His decision to compare responses to colors and to art objects from the same subjects seems a logical extension from his concern with Bullough's work and from the controversy which he notes about the validity of aesthetic responses evoked by simple stimuli. Related research. The division of the review of literature into sections dealing with The Development of Aesthetic Behaviors, The Effect of Art Training on Aesthetic Behaviors, and Categorization of Aesthetic Response Statements is most helpful in developing continuity among the large number of studies discussed. This chapter is thorough and competent; however, the inclusion of thirty-two pages on The Development of Aesthetic Behaviors is a little puzzling since the Bulley &amp; Burt (p. 36) study is the only one cited in it which attempted to consider special training in art. The remainder investigate the effects of age on aesthetic judgments. Since age was not a variable to be studied in the dissertation one supposes that the review was done in preparation for some future research. (Indeed, under Suggestions for Further Study one discovers that this is the case.) It may be useful to readers, but it is not essential for identifying any theoretical basis in the study. A section Defining the Art Object also seems curious since the emphasis in the dissertation is placed on investigating types of verbal responses, rather than on eliciting information about art objects. Research objectives and methodology. The research objectives and hypo theses are clearly set forth. The only question which arises is why the decision was made not to use a statistical method for testing the hypothesis that data from the color preference test and the object evaluation test can be grouped in five categories (Objective, Physiological, Associative, Character, Extrinsic). Since using several judges to categorize the statements and reporting the extent of their agreement is such an obvious procedure it must have been considered and rejected. It would be interesting to know the reason. Since the objective states the intent to measure the number of statements in each of the five categories the non-statistical procedure is logically consistent. A statistical method would have added power to the conclusion about the usefulness of the category system; however, the results are quite accurately reported as feasible. 75 RRVEE</page><page sequence="6">The application of statistical procedures to analyze the data is impressively competent and thorough. For example, analysis of variance revealed slight differences between the levels of training as manifested in the responses to the colors and to the paintings from individuals classified in each of the five categories. However, these differences were not consistent so he employed a Pearson Product Moment Correlation analysis between number of responses in each category and number of credit hours. This procedure disclosed a significant positive correlation between art training and the tendency to make response statements in the Physiological category in response to colors; and a significant negative correlation between art training and the tendency to give Character responses to non-objective art objects. In considering the testing methods it seems curious that three judges were used to ascertain that the two paintings employed in the study were art objects, but that The basis for selection was not the relative merits of the paintings...' (p. 55). The stated criteria of non-objectivity, portability, and artists unknown to the subjects would not seem to have precluded a consideration of merit. Also no reason is advanced for presenting the colors one at a time for the subjects' responses, yet showing the two paintings simultaneously to them. Since it is not reported who classified the statements into categories it must be assumed that the investigator did so. In this case, credence in the cate gory system might have been enhanced and the study considerably enriched by reporting samples of the response statements. Another addition of possible help to readers would be the inclusion of Bullough's directions in the Appendix. The writer is to be commended for pointing out possible weaknesses in the painting stimuli which might be responsible for the similar responses to single colors and to paintings. These are their lack of literal content and their relatively simple surfaces. Results and discussion. The significant correlation between verbalizations generated by single colors and by paintings as manifested in the investi gator's ability to classify them in one of five categories needs to be examined not only for what it indicates about verbal responses, but also for what it reveals about this category system as an instrument and about 76 RRVEE</page><page sequence="7">the researcher's categorization. Without access to the original statements it is impossible to determine what, if any, crucial differences exist to which the category system is not sensitive. The emergence of learned styles or patterns for describing responses does seem justified by the data. This possibility appears to hold considerable potential for additional study. The statement that the typology is a useful device 'for analysis of the writings of professional art critics' (p. 98) cannot be attributed to any data reported in the dissertation. As a speculation it properly belongs under Suggestions for Further Study where it reoccurs. An expanded system of ten categories, Evaluative, Preferential, Intentional, Historical, Objective, Physiological, Associative, Character, Extrinsic, and Functional, is included in the Conclusions section. The author reports that these refinements were suggested by the response data. They appear to allow finer discriminations which should enrich future research involving aesthetic response statements. Reviewers commentary. A primary purpose of this study was to compare responses to both colors and art objects by the same subjects. Arnold states that the results of this comparison may indicate whether subjects respond in a similar manner to both simple and complex stimuli, and that they may establish guidelines for choosing stimuli for research on aesthetic response. Another way of putting this objective might be to say that he was searching for an instrument which does not discriminate between responses to single colors and to art objects. For what purpose? Because, as he notes, the use of single colors as stimuli would simplify research on aesthetic response statements. No one would quarrel with the position that the physical management of sheets of colored cardboard is easier than handling art objects: the cardboard sheets require little storage space, the monetary investment in them is relatively slight, and should they be lost or damaged they can be replaced with assurance. This much is obvious; an additional advantage accruing to the single colors as stimuli is that they do not confront the researcher with the problems of controlling for such awkwardly complex factors as variations in subject matter, in media, in scale, in style, and in the subjects' previous learning in art. When these factors are compounded further by considerations of 77 RRVEE</page><page sequence="8">the interactions among them, one can understand the appeal of single factors as stimuli; indeed, researchers in the field of psychology have utilized single colors, sounds, and smells as stimuli for responses which they have termed 'aesthetic'-a procedure which Arnold is aware has evoked controversy. In fact, he relates some of the history of this dispute to establish the need for this aspect of his study. Unfortunately, one searches in vain for a concern expressed that such an instrument might simplify the aesthetic responses as well as the research procedures. What are the research applications for a system of categories which does not distinguish between responses to colored sheets of cardboard and to art objects? Clearly, it will not generate much information about works of art. Its most fruitful implication seems to be for investigating styles of verbal responses. As Arnold states: '...there seems to be a certain consistency in the way that people describe their responses to aesthetic stimuli. This would seem to imply that individuals learn a style or pattern for describing responses, and that this style remains consistent as the type of stimulus changes' (p. 94). Such a tendency might be supported by categorizing verbal responses to a variety of stimuli, such as music, writing, dance, and people. If significant agreement across stimuli did verify such styles they might be useful for exploring relation ships with other variables. The findings in this dissertation suggest that there is little relation between categories of response and art training. There is a possibility that a comparison with age might give support to a developmental foundation, for these categories, but the nearly equal numbers of subjects classified in each of the four Bullough categories in this study does not seem to encourage such an approach. Finally, the author presents in the Discussion some sensitive qualifications which do not appear in the objectives, hypotheses, or results. For example, after expressing surprise that individuals who are highly trained in art respond in a manner that is similar in objectivity to those with almost no training, he adds: 'Perhaps attempting to train students to be totally objective in response to aesthetic stimuli is an exercise in futility, in that, regardless of the amount of art training people receive, aesthetic experience is enriched by subjective responses. It appears to be a natural state of affairs for individuals to attend not only to the surface counters of an art object but also to the feelings that that object is generating within them. It may be that people can be taught to be increasingly aware of the 78 RRVEE</page><page sequence="9">surface qualities of an art object, while at the same time retaining their subjective involvement with the object' (pp. 95-96). To the reviewer this kind of concern enriched the dissertation as well. FOOTNOTES 1. Kenneth R. Beittel, Mind and Context in the Art of Drawing (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1972). 2.
