Data: Developments in Art, Theory and Aesthetics. Ed. Anthony Hill. Faber &amp; Faber, London, 1968. 302 pp., illus. ?5 5s. and New York Graphic Society, Greenwich, Connecticut, 1969. $15.00. Reviewed by: Kenneth Frampton* Appropriately compared by Hill to the publication Circle, edited for the same house in 1937 by J. L. Martin, N. Gabo and B. Nicholson, this anthology, under the name of Data, is a compilation of some twenty-eight essays on art and its relation to the cosmos, nature, aesthetics and society. Circle, in its day, was parenthetically entitled an 'Inter- national Survey of Constructive Art'. Data is an abbreviation for 'Developments in Art, Theory and Aesthetics'. These titular differences are sym- bolic. Circle, its name a Platonic icon, appeared in the provincial English climate of the late 'thirties as a pioneer presentation of so-called international style architecture and structural art. Its synthetic platform extended to briefly embrace typography and even choreography. Despite incipient European fascism, its editorial stance was to celebrate the imminent machine-age civilization and the coming of the new man. Paradoxically, it was also infused with ricochets of early Stalinism and with the shades of an approaching war, and with the vibrance of European refugee talent en route to America. No parallel momentous historical turning attends the appearance of Data-or does it ? Fourteen years ago Alloway's modest and per- ceptive collection of essays entitled Nine Abstract Artists witnessed the emergence of a group of 'structural' artists in England. This orientation, in which a number of the contributors to this volume played a prominent part, namely, Stephen Gilbert, *Department of Architecture, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., U.S.A. Kenneth and Mary Martin, Victor Pasmore, Gillian Wise and the editor, at once distinguished itself from the post-war St. Ives school of 'expressive abstraction', an influence whose roots were em- bedded in Circle. As a collection, the Data essays are difficult to place. There is something here of course of the late 'sixties but also a great deal that savours not only of 30 years ago but also of the turn of the century. The oldest contributor, L. E. J. Brouwer was 19 at the beginning of the century; while the youngest, Lev Nusberg, was born in Moscow in the same year as the publication of Circle. The texts thus represent a wide range in generations; in and out of the labyrinth of which it is difficult to find one's way. With the inclusion of five guest editors who are not artists, a mathematician, a physicist, an engineer, a sociologist and an architect, the mixture becomes extremely rich and the implications of much of the content are too extensive to be easily digested. This is a book for meditation and discourse. By com- parison, the euphoric avant-garde style of Circle was in general easier to apprehend. One may best gauge the anthology as a whole by reference to the editor's own essay, entitled 'Pro- gramme, Paragram and Structure', which is so rigo- rous in its initial approach as to afford a reasonable datum to which other contributions may be com- pared. Hill's central concern is the issue of mathe- matical thematic. The discourse parallels his essay on 'Art and Mathesis' which appeared in Leonardo 1, 233 (1968). Hill postulates an inherent relation between the structural 'thematic' of an art work and its structural 'programme'. By 'paragram', Hill intends a visual expository aid such as a diagram, table or graph. It is obvious that a structural the- matic may be derived from such a device. However, with the 'gestalt' hypothesis implicitly rejected by the author as an indeterminate quantum, it is 235</page><page sequence="2">Books-Livres somewhat less easy to envisage the means by which a 'structured' program or an artistic intention is to be derived from an 'axiomatic' methodical evalua- tion of human perception. Hill discusses two op- posing theses for deriving such values. The first is the mathematician Birkhoff's aesthetic measure, in which the measure is expressed as a ratio of the number of order elements (i.e. vertical and rotational symmetry, etc.) over the number of complexity elements. The second is the biologist Rashevsky's concern for the degree of organization in a structure, topologically considered as a measure of the information it contains. The information in a Mondrian, for example, would be, according to the latter principle, determined as the number of nodal points (i.e. 3 lines meeting at a point) occurring in the identity infrastructure of the painting in question. As Hill demonstrated in 'Art and Mathesis', the translation of such infrastructures into graph theory networks often results in visually apparent asym- metries producing conditions of topological sym- metry. In all this, the intention is to move towards a general phenomenology of structure but, as Hill asks rather inconclusively, how is one to measure the degree of asymmetry in an asymmetric graph? One might add, what would be the consequence for such a relative value, if its apparent structure was initially symmetrical ? Some of these essays may be seen as being vaguely related according to certain affiliations. Thus, the Swiss artists Richard Lohse, Karl Gerstner and Max Bill are, besides their common 'concrete' art attitude, possessed of a certain 'artisan' reservation, which serves to contain the extent of their specula- tions. Lohse's essay is without doubt the most discursive, yet even he clearly divides his contribu- tion into three distinct parts: a modest introduction; a slightly gratuitous, but nonetheless interesting, comparative survey of the parallel developments of Neo-plasticism and Suprematism; and, finally, an account of the principles and progressions governing a sequence of four of his serial modular compositions. Similarly, Gerstner gives a direct account of the conceptual development of a series of so-called 'tension' pictures, in which designed, semi-trans- parent plastic surfaces are subjected to induced internal stresses. These stresses are then revealed by polarized light and the spectrum image varied by manipulating the stresses. Of this in 1966 he wrote: 'As a picture it is not new, but cribbed from the physicists (they would say, a toy). As an idea it is not original but inspired by Duchamp (which pleases him). As art it is questionable anyway (it is not true: that its having been in the Museum of Modern Art does not prove anything?). Wherein lies my authorization, my qualification as an artist ? What does my work consist of? (Perhaps in that I have designed it as an object ?)' Bill, whose intentions are diametrically opposed, takes up this issue in his essay 'Art as Non-change- able Fact' and demands, as Brouwer and Bohm do elsewhere that: 'We can ask that every means which is appropriate to originate a work of art be actually used. But that does not dispense with a thorough investigation of where the meaning and the possi- bilities of art lie.' Bill continues, 'if we start from the principle that art is aesthetic information, we have to ask: information for whom ? by whom ? by means of what? information on what: on an aesthetic fact ?... Presuming that art could be described in this way, one should also know what purpose this aesthetic information serves. I say: it serves as an unchangeable message from today to today [sic] and into the future.... The purpose of art is to give an aesthetic measure. ... Its basis is the durability of its newness as aesthetic information. The kinetic artists belong to the domain of jugglers, . . . We find pleasure in their friendly and funny ways .... But one should not see more than there really is: entertainment. This, however, has never been the idea of art and (unfortunately) never will be.' Biederman, Bornstein and Baljeu may also be considered as related despite their 'internal' diver- gences. In all three, there is a preoccupation with nature as the ultimate model informing all creation. In Biederman's case, this constitutes the basis for a circular, opaque and repetitious thesis set out in dialogue form, while for Bornstein it is the occasion for an exposition of the 'structurist' process of creation from nature, as first theoretically formul- ated by Biederman. Bornstein writes of this process as follows: 'When we look at a tree or flower or a blade of grass, for example, ideas relevant to art are suggested. Nature here can suggest structural potential in terms of utilization of form, space, color and light relationships .... The process in realizing a specific work . .. does not feed on mathe- matics, science or technology, even though such relationships may be observed afterwards'. Nothing could be further from the 'mathesis' position of Hill or from, say, that of Vasarely's 'industrialism'. It is close, however, to that of Baljeu, whose architec- tonic conception of 'synthesist plastic expression' is based on the belief that in the future all the arts will merge into one. This is surely the nineteenth- century ideal of a Gesamtkunstwerk in which plastic expression, according to Baljeu, will produce an architecture that is not only functional but plastic and polychromatic at the same time'. Are we not here close to transcendental idealism? In contrast, the members of the now extinct Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel present a con- stellation of thought that is terse, lucid and delibe- rately restricted. Francois Morellet envisages the future of art as being concerned with: (1) a reduction in the arbitrary, (2) impersonal realization and (3) with the transcending of stasis through actual move- ment or through spectator manipulation. The latter being related to his idea of art as a form of visual play. A similar stance is adopted by Jean Pierre Yvaral, who writes of the group's aims as follows: 'We would like to replace those works in which creation makes itself out to be magic, for works whose essence relies on the exercise of visual per- ception and the awareness of vision that the plastic artist as well as the spectator can have .... For some 236</page><page sequence="3">Books-Livres of us, the work constitutes the substance of a game which abides by its own rules. The spectator is drawn into an active participation, whether he has to shift his position or manipulate the work'. (cf. Gerstner's 'tension' picture.) Victor Vasarely, Yvaral's father, holds of course to this Lissitzkian view, wherein, above all else, the spectator must be actively engaged by the art object. In somewhat orthodox 'l'art mobile' style, Vasarely, like Malina, would use mechanical devices and cinematic projection to this end. While soundly extolling permutation and the universal binary principle as the essential bases for all structural art, his more socio-cultural considerations border, like those of Nicholas Schoffer, on the frontiers of science fiction. Vasarely postulates the existence of an as yet undetermined, standard plastic element, which he refers to as a 'form-color unit'. This he states will constitute 'the basis of a new plastic language, new also in its adaptability to industrial technique'. There is a hint here of totalitarianism, which is apprehensively referred to elsewhere in the essays of Nusberg and Wise. Vasarely, who has probably done more than any other living artist to serialize and mass market his product, comes close in his technocratic-cybernetic view to Hill and Molnar, with their semiotic preoccupations on the one hand, and to Nieuwenhuys and Baljeu, with their distinct but nonetheless common concerns for a l'crt total and an industrialized environment on the other. Both Vasarely and Schoffer tend to levitate comfortably in somewhat dated realms of scientistic speculation. Unconstrained by either Baljeu's idealism or Nieuwenhuys' anarchy, they proffer to the future masses not bread but circuses (cf. Bill). They both postulate infinitely permutable Luna Parks of automated aesthetic satisfaction. Once again Gesamtkunstwerken! Little separates, surely, Vasarely's neocapitalistic city of perpetual youth from Schoffer's Proustian preoccupations with microtime (?) and his vague concept of the art object as an 'energic temporal mass' (?), to be deistically regarded 'as the breath of universal life'). 'If all time is eternally present, all time is redeemable' so goes Eliot's aphoristic thought. So then Schoffer's thesis of the eternal return, the modern trinity of art, science and religion may be restored to their ancient unity. Are we to take this postulation as an intellectual parallel to the vague implications of Stanley Kubrick's film '2001'? Buoyed up as both Vasarely and Schoffer are by Utopian euphoria and the illusion of universal industrial affluence, one cannot but question both the cogency of their thought and the theoretical relevance of their theory. Vantongerloo, like Schoffer, is a man preoccupied with time but in a manner ostensibly more logical. In 1957 he wrote: 'Light reveals itself by the surface on which it falls and, in the same way, it reveals the surface. The speed (energy) of the illuminated object, in accordance with the speed of our vision, reveals time to us. On either side of the speed of these illuminated bodies, our vision is unable to perceive the bodies or the light. Nor can it experience the duration of time. If this state changes its speed, it re-enters the infinite. For a blind person objects and space reveal themselves through the tactile sense and duration through the sense of hearing'. Almost all of the last twenty years of Vantonger- loo's work depended upon this conceptual relation between, 'time, light and speed'. His work could now only be apprehended, as it were, through the sense extension of the camera. It depended upon shutter speed and emulsion for its realization. This was a subtle relation between an apparat and a work of art, not I believe anticipated in Walter Benjamin's famous essay, 'The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction'. No longer is the art object produced in the conventional sense but rather becomes the occasion for the infinite 'exposure' of space creation. Its 'scale-lessness', as a metaphor of incommensurable cosmic space activity, derives almost exclusively from its photograph. It demands for its appreciation an oscillation between object and image, in addition to an innate sense for space, free from any familiar conception as to its phenomenal appearance. Thus, Vantongerloo's late work depended for its appreciation upon a rare cultural fusion of scientific knowledge and spatial sensibility; an attention which it rarely, if ever, received. Gillian Wise, whose essay reveals a parallel interest in scalar transposition from micro to macro space, touches very delicately upon this problem of communication. 'Anyone investigating how: it is this medium can communicate ideas and sensations', she writes, 'has to take into account simultaneously (1) the artist who in some way manages to transform an experience or an idea into, (2) a tangible object and (3) the spectator to whom this experience may or may not be transmitted. In other words, the artist may be in possession of an idea or a set of ideas which until he has found some way of pro- jecting effectively to others might just as well never have existed.' This seems to refer quite directly to the dilemma of Vantongerloo. The five 'guest' contributors to this volume present 'lay' views on this predicament, which obliquely cut across cultural issues raised by the artists. The elegiac 'voice' of the Dutch mathematician Brouwer condemns the emphasis placed in the twentieth century upon causality and the rational. He argues that science is eminently a system of causal thinking and that this manifested as technique is inherently based on mathematics. He states: 'The significance of mathematics with regard to scientific thinking mainly consists in this, that a group of observed causal sequences can often be manipulated more easily by extending its of-quality-divested substratum to a hypothesis, i.e. a more comprehen- sive and surveyable mathematical system. Casual sequences represented in abstraction in the hypo- thesis, but so far neither observed nor found observable, often find their realization later'. This 237</page><page sequence="4">Books-Livres view that causal thought, abstracted as mathematics, leads via induction on occasion to prediction, technique and form finds its corollary in the con- tribution of the engineer Le Ricolais, wherein we find the following: 'As we have seen, the mathe- matical language and its symbols have been and will always be an enormous reservoir of unexploited forms. It is a rule that abstract concepts devised purely for the support of thought, have later found their due place in the vocabulary of applied science by virtue of the power of abstraction and the non- anthropomorphic attitude of the mind before the unknown'. However, Brouwer is far from content to leave the issue, as Le Ricolais does, with the complacent prospect of an infinite abstract generation of both form and technique. For Brouwer, as for the physicist Bohm, the essential question remains where in all this is 'beauty, mutual understanding, wisdom and truth'. The answer for Brouwer, at least, lies not in 'the expansion of human domination over nature' but rather in 'constructional beauty . .. evoking sensations of power, balance, harmony' and in the introspective play of acausal mathematics. As for mutual understanding, Brouwer regards all sc-called exchanges of thought as mere 'will trans- missions' through the wire netting of human linguistic systems towards never ending acts of co- operative instrumentalization. The ultimate end of this voracious extension Brouwer foresees as 'a sceptical prognosis that mankind, possessed by the delusion of causality, will slide away in a deteriora- tive process of overpopulation, industrialization, serfdom and devastation of nature, and that, when hereby first its spiritual and then its physiological conditions of life will have been destroyed, it will come to its end like a colony of bacteria in the Earth's crust having fulfilled its task'. The recogni- tion of this fate for Brouwer does not imply bondage but simply that art and philosophy should seek dis- engagement as conative activity from the trivial, cooperative 'final aims of mass comfort and mass security'. Brouwer does not deal with the issue that structural beauty, as architecture, must depend on co-operation. This elitest and anarchic view lies in paradoxical opposition to Nieuwenbuy's egalitarian city of affluent anarchic-socialist order; his New Babylon, within the 'wallessness' of which all will be bene- volently encouraged to attain their 'level of creative power'. This 'model' city of the homo ludens can hardly be said to exist as a coherent proposition. It is this that largely serves to distinguish it from the equally indeterminate elevated urban infrastructure of the architect Yona Friedman's 'ville spatiale'. Otherwise, both 'models' vaguely imply anarchic, 'leisure'-conditioned, hedonistic societies; industri- alized, according to a more equable distribution of the world's resources and restrained only by laws designed to maintain the homeostasis of the population. These models are surely designed to accommodate the population of Abraham Moles' first city of the 'happily administered', 'who have voluntarily re- linquished all pretensions to self government, since they are so comfortably organized by others, who themselves accept the burden of this responsibility and power'. For Moles, the sociologist, these others 'constitute the second city, that of the technocrats, who have absorbed the politicians in the name of "specialists in political science". This city is in size no more than one per cent of the preceding one and lies on its border, from where it sends emissaries into the whole social body. Its scale of values rests on efficiency, optimalization, smooth functioning, the absence of conflict.' Moles' third city is that of 'the intellectuals who, . . . having the same intel- lectual quotient as the technocrats, are actively anarchic' and 'are more interested in innovation than routine, in revolution than administration, in the idea than its realization, in creation than in execution'. Moles brings us, then, to the portals of that which Jean Duvignauv has called the intellectual ghetto, within which both the texts and the illustrations of this volume were produced. No wonder that the models presented herein of art in relation to society are largely anarchic. But are they? The synthesist- industrialized environment, even granted a New Babylon, is surely incompatible with anarchy; witness the daily domination of present technique over everyday life. Cybernetization does not guarantee freedom; quite the contrary. So that even if one accepts as reasonable the axiomatics of Friedman's 'ville spatiale', one remains unconvinced that such an infrastructure, either as a simulation model or as an actuality, would be inherently inured, as its author has maintained, against the dictates of totalitarian control. Nor is the charming lucidity of Moles' essay quite as reassuring as it might first appear to be. Moles states that, 'a new social contract will be drawn up based on a tacit, mutual and permanent incompre- hension; the intellectuals appearing to believe that the technocrats give them money to tear at the fabric of ideas and to give themselves up to delightful games of mental ingenuity ... (and) . .. the techno- crats believing that the intellectuals are trying to improve man's lot by creating new values'. A minimal quotient of societal tolerance is necessary for this contract to be maintained and this, as is apparent, is not always forthcoming. If, as Moles states, 'the value fundamental to the intellectual society is subversion: in order to create, one must be against; subversion carefully maintained by the amount of adrenalin in the blood, through indigna- tion', then it must also be conceded that there exist today large societies in which such subversion is strictly prescribed; in which it is patently forbidden 'to tear at the fabric of ideas'. One should note that these societies do not appear, as yet, to seriously falter from the point of view of technocratic management, although, whether those administered are to be deemed happy is another issue. Furthermore, in so-called 'open societies', technocratic manipulations and average human 238</page><page sequence="5">Books-Livres limitations will jointly conspire to limit the culture zone of the happily administered to a vulgarized mean, in which an opiate of popular entertainment and information will continue to prevail. It is unlikely that this will effect the apparent quantum of 'happiness' but it does mean that highly idealistic cultural goals for mass societies will have to be, once and for all, relinquished by those who, up to now, have remained faithful in essence to the equalitarian Gesamtkunstwerk ideal; an ideal adhered to, in different forms, throughout twentieth-century cul- ture by Utopian Socialists, Theosophists and Neue Sachlichkeit Marxists alike. Moles' thesis means that the city of the happily administered and the intellectual ghetto will remain forever separate, despite a certain passage of trade, via technocracy, between them. The technocratic alternative under extreme totalitarianism is the liquidation of the ghetto. This will bring little comfort to those perennial revolutionaries, who still dream of a golden age in which the intellectual (the exceptional) and the great mass (the normal) of mankind will be happily united in mutual understanding. A refusal to accept this prime existential limitation may have engendered many of the varied and paradoxical reactions of recent date. From the generation of Pop art to acultural activity; from method-idolatory to gratuitous (i.e. anti-ideological) student guerrilla revolt. Neither the ever-increasing world population nor the technical infrastructure now essential to its maintenance are, in any significant sense, immedi- ately reversible. Hence, the administered will still require to be administered as happily as possible and the technocrat will remain indispensable. There remain, however, very real, crucial, yet unglamorous battles to be waged against both the 'ideology of waste' (consumption) and the 'waste of ideology' (suppression). Thus, the new social contract envisaged by Moles demands for the former the committed technocrat, forever bound to causality; while for the latter, it demands the committed intellectual, whose role, within the interstices of an otherwise homogenous society, is to engender human spirituality and thought through the tactics of creative refusal. This is a very far cry from the naive utopianism of Circle and one is provoked to ask-is it to this end that Data has been brought into being, whatever the original intention? If so, then it is this end that must be acknowledged and applauded; for the intellectual city must in the last analysis create and, to an extent, independently maintain the substance of its culture. Creation picturale et ordre cerebral. Marcelle Wahl. Preface par Andre Lwoff. Editions Ditis, 1964. 257 pp., illus. Compte-rendu par: Fran$ois Molnar* Sur le bord du Danube, j'ecris ces quelques lignes. Installe dans le confort esthetique que la civilisation *54 rue Halle, 75-Paris 14, France. 17 capitaliste assure a ces lieux, je me rappelle les discussions esthetiques que j'ai eues pendant six semaines dans un pays socialiste voisin. Nous n'avons parle que de peinture, de peinture occiden- tale sous sa forme la plus moderne. Mais pouvais-je vraiment defendre comme ceuvres d'art, des taches de peinture projetees contre une toile dans une fureur sacree (ou mondaine) ou a l'autre extreme, des cubes en matiere plastique, aux couleurs criardes ? Mes interlocuteurs pouvaient-ils serieusement com- parer leur peinture post-impressionniste, post- expressionniste ou semi-abstraite aux oeuvres d'un Cezanne ou d'un Mondrian? Certes, les arguments ne manquaient ni d'un cote ni de l'autre. Moi, je pouvais me servir de tout le vocabulaire de la critique internationale en faveur d'un art 'autre', de 'morale', de 'participation' ou 'd'anti-art' (anart). Je pouvais le faire d'autant mieux que les mots constituant ce vocabulaire n'ont que rarement un sens precis. Ce sont des mots, ce ne sont que des mots que des mots, comme disait Hamlet. Mes amis, eux, pouvaient utiliser, sans s'y referer explicitement, des arguments de feu Jdanov, enterre meme aux yeux de ses partisans les plus conserva- teurs. Ils parlaient de comprehension, d'education, de culture socialiste. Je leur opposais: intuition, liberte de creation, spontaneite. Puis je change d'interlocuteur. Les citations implicites de Jdanov se trouvent remplacees par celles de Hegel, de Marx. Je puise alors dans un autre arsenal, le structuralisme: je parle de Levi-Strauss, de Foucault, de Barthes. On peut en discuter des semaines, des mois, s'il le faut. La philosophie devient rhetorique, la verite victime des mots. Serions-nous plus avances? Pourrions-nous reellement juger une ceuvre? A cette question, d'ailleurs, tous les estheticiens nous rieraient au nez. La science, notre science, disent- ils, ne porte pas de jugements de valeur, elle est descriptive. Cette affirmation ne manque pas d'une certaine hypocrisie: en choisissant l'objet a examiner parmi d'autres, on porte un jugement de valeur. Certains estheticiens etudient l'objet deja repute comme ceuvre d'art. Le jugement de valeur a ete, dans ce cas, effectue par d'autres. La philosophie, chez ses meilleurs representants, se preoccupe seulement des essences. 'On ne peut pas 'deriver' la plus mince verite portant sur les faits en partant de l'essence' dit Husserl. Or, un peintre devant sa toile a faire, ou devant celle d'un autre a juger, a besoin de faits. On a tendance a desesperer. On ne peut ni juger, ni prevoir. Doit-on alors se resigner et attendre passivement que l'art tombe definitivement aux mains de petits plaisantins ou de grands marchands ? Le seul espoir nous vient des sciences. II faut examiner le fait d'art a l'aide de methodes scientifi- ques rigoureuses qui s'averent si fructueuses dans d'autres domaines. L'esthetique doit devenir 'fact finding' dans le sens que donne a cette notion Hume, et passer ainsi necessairement par l'experimentation. Cette idee n'est pas neuve. Fechner, des 1870, a pose les grands principes de cette methode. Toutes les tentatives faites dans cette direction se sont 239</page></plain_text>
