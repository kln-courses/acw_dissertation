<plain_text><page sequence="1">FACING DEATH AT 80: Memory and the Holy F. David Martin I. Final Exits 'A^e found the nursing home. We asked for our old friend. "She is no longer with us." We asked again. "She is no longer with us." "Where is she?" "She is no longer with us." "Is she dead?" "She is no longer with us." I was very close to my grandfather. Suddenly he was no longer around. He had gone to heaven to be with angels and all kinds of good things. I was not allowed to see him in the coffin or go to the church service or the cemetery. I would be with him again some day. I kept asking: "Where is Heaven?" "Up in the sky some- where!" Yet I knew his body was in the ground somewhere out there in the cemetery. I began to be very frightened by death. We don't die. We "pass away" or "go to a better place" or "give up the ghost." Death - the inevitable destiny of us all, the Big Event, the possibility of personal annihilation - is universally horrify- ing. It is hard to accept that there will come a time when we won't be part of the cosmic party. But as we age the whispering of the Angel of Death becomes louder: "Thou wilt cease to be." We take every available path to escape such warnings. We keep busy, avoid loneliness, avoid philosophers and poets, imagine death far in the future, make death thoughts humorous - "Well folks," the cheery conductor yells, as the train slowly stops in a cold dark tunnel, "Here we are at Good Old Oblivion. Everybody out!" (James Thurber) - or think ironically, as in Emily Dickinson: Because I could not stop for Death - He kindly stopped for me - F.

David Martin The carriage held but just ourselves - And immortality. The easiest escape, of course, and the most popular by far, is simply believing with total faith in an afterlife, and entertaining no questions. It is bad enough to die without talking about it. Wipe death from your vocabulary. Bury it. Recently I was asked to lecture on the subject of my choosing. I submitted "Facing Death." The hosts were shocked. I compromised: "Immortality: Pros and Cons." Typically when the day of doom is very near, doctors gobbledy- gook; nurses go into a whispering mode; good-willed acquaint- ances, looking like healthy undertakers, advise: "Come on, you look great." Tears are out. Euphemisms are in. The "final exit" rarely comes at home. With the elderly, in the United States, at least three out of four die in hospitals or nurs- ing homes. Then out the back door to the morgue. Die by noon and gone by evening. The mortician embalms the cadaver. Then with fastidious grooming and dainty tints, for rigor mortis is an ugly portrait painter, a resurrection occurs: an "almost living" in beautiful sleep, dressed in clothes perhaps never worn before. The funeral parlor, despite the expensive flowers, is perfumed; the over-priced casket is uncomfortably voyeured; the resurrec- tion is praised; the funeral director (the "doctor of grief) has everything under courteous control; the family is kept busy with decisions and papers and greetings; the service is "performed" in the funeral chapel; the procession to the cemetery, starting of course from the funeral "home," is a parade of limousines, wor- thy of Donald Trump, to a tent beside a pit banked by earth hid- den by something that looks like astroturf; the clergyman proclaims death is not death; and the "loved one" is "laid to rest." The solid-copper casket (suggesting penury, "coffin" is out), guaranteed for ever-lasting protection, sometimes equipped with foam rubber and inner-spring mattress, is dropped only after the mourners are safely out of sight. Finally the flowers are dumped, and the earth shoveled in. In the entertainment media, violent scenes of death make death appear functional. In the news media, the images of the slaughtered in their mass graves make death so incongruous as to be unbelievable. Death is reduced to images and statistics. Death is dying.</page><page sequence="3">Facing Death at 80 303 Because we do not face death - do not think about it straight and hard - we allow death to get the better of us. We turn away from what we are. We ignore what our future deaths mean in our lives now. We think of ourselves only as "the living," ignoring that we are also "the dying," which is precisely what defines "being alive." We forget to be thankful for being alive if we forget our deaths. The Jesuitical verse applies to the non-religious as well as the religious. To be blessed in death, one must learn to live. To be blessed in life, one must learn to die. We become confused about everything concerning death. How do we help the dying? How do we handle our grief? Should we oppose suicide? Assisted suicide? What about capital punish- ment? Should the life of human vegetables be prolonged? When, if ever, is it right to pull the plug? What about the costly trans- plant that keeps the elderly alive versus the young who may also need the operation? No normal person, except in very abnormal situations, wants to die. For most of us, furthermore, direct or personal exper- iences of death are infrequent. A family in the United States may go twenty years without suffering any death. When death does occur, the prevailing attitude is to treat it impersonally and as an aberration. The taboos dominating virtually all aspects of death help pre- vent us from learning how to cope with our own inevitable end. Despite the mass-deaths of the twentieth century and the possible world wipe-out from nuclear explosions, we live in a society, un- like most societies before us, in which every effort is made to con- ceal death. For the elderly, the last remaining social obligation is to disappear quietly. The old Christian cemetery, usually owned by the church, was centered in the village or town. The modern city of the dead, as was the custom in ancient Greece and Rome, is located in the outskirts of the city of the living. The few visitors are not ex- pected to notice who lies beneath the stone. No one is expected to cry. The cemetery is probably owned by a profit association. For me, a teacher of philosophy dedicated to the systematic examination of mankind's fundamental beliefs, death was always an ongoing topic. No topic was more challenging. Furthermore, the prospect of death, as Dr. Johnson said, "wonderfully concen-</page><page sequence="4">304 SOUNDINGS F. David Martin trates the mind." Yet my examination was basically abstract. Now that I am in my early eighties, old but not quite "old old," it is no longer so. Before, the actuality of my Big Event was miles away well down the road somewhere. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't quite believe it. Now that I am "an elderly," the some- where is anytime and soon. Death is always close for the elderly, internalized. Many may not face it, but most are well aware of it. As with the young, the time of death is uncertain, but the elderly are more likely to real- ize that we may die in the very next instant. The longing for im- mortality usually deepens with aging, provoking a deepening fear of death. Even for the experienced escapists, a "mood of death" shadows their paths. Growing old is like being increasingly pun- ished for a crime we did not commit. People are dying all around us. Our loss of friends accelerates. Who next will disappear? The body resonates with dire signals. Even in the most joyful mo- ments, a dread of death usually permeates. Or so it has been with me. Try as I may, and despite my profoundest desire, I cannot be- lieve in a personal afterlife. The evidence seems to me over- whelming. Our bodies locate our consciousness in time and space. What would a consciousness be like that is nowhere or everywhere? Is it then possible to die with dignity? I hope that I can here articulate a way of facing death that clarifies the issues for me and is helpful to others, a way that transforms to some extent the "mood of death," lessens its anxiety without illusion and pro- motes serenity. I will have to speak from personal experience. I shall try to shed half a century of the professional philosopher's academic style and jargon. I shall not try to persuade. II. Mortimer Adler and Beyond Temperament, upbringing, fortune, and age inevitably deter- mine, often decisively, the way we face or escape from death. We are, according to William James, either "tender-minded" or "tough-minded." There are those whom we find indulging to their heart's content in the prospect of immortality; and there are others who experience the greatest difficulty in making such a notion seem real. These latter persons are tied to their senses, restricted to their natural experience; and many of them, moreo-</page><page sequence="5">Facing Death at 80 305 ver, feel an intellectual loyalty to what they call "hard facts." They are shocked by the excursions of the "tender-minded" into the unseen. I belong, with some qualifications, with the "tough minded." My "tender-hearted" friend might interpret Goethe's last words - "more light" - as his glimpse of heaven. I think it is more likely that Goethe wanted the blinds opened. My friend might interpret death as a window opening to eternity. I inter- pret death as a permanently locked door with a mirror on its back reflecting the past. Nothing is more personal than death, and all of us have an absolute right to deal with it in our own way. I shall try to follow the common creed of common sense. This creed rejects supersti- tion. Common sense cannot accept beliefs, such as that the world was created in six days, that contradict scientific evidence. For common sense Tertullian's claim is nonsense: "The Son of God died; this is believable because it does not make sense. And after he was buried, he rose again; this is quite certain, because it is impossible." Common sense, however, can accept beliefs based on "soft facts," experiential verification as distinct from experi- mental verification. Rational beings can distinguish reality from fantasy, even when the scientific method is not applicable. Thus our beliefs about death are verified in so far as they "ring true" to our observations. Experience can teach us how well-founded or ill-founded our beliefs are. A belief that the dead return as ghosts defies the experience of almost everyone. On the other hand, the belief that telling the truth to the terminally ill is better than lies generally proves its validity, as hospice practitioners have learned, because it spares both the dying and their kin the pain- ful effort of false pretense. Of course, what is common sense to me may not be common sense to you. There are three basic perspectives that channel to a degree our thinking about death: theism, atheism, and pantheism. The agnostics keep circling those perspectives without resolution. Theists believe the sacred or holy transcends the secular. Atheists believe there is only the secular. Pantheists believe the sacred and the secular are inextricably interlinked. Theists believe in God (or Gods); atheists do not believe in God; and for pantheists there is no God as an all-transcendent entity, but they do believe in the sacred. Theists for the most part believe in an afterlife. Atheists do not believe in an afterlife. Pantheists for the most</page><page sequence="6">306 SOUNDINGS F. David Martin part do not believe in an afterlife. Without endless qualifications, these generalizations will make theologians and philosophers squirm. So be it. Some of us elderly want to get to the core of these matters, and time is limited. For many theists, not having to face death is easy. If there is simple faith, straight and hard thinking about death is unneces- sary. Death does not annihilate us. Death is a transition from this world to a better one. In our time, this flight from here to eter- nity is made easier by the disappearance of hell. Mark Twain: "I cannot see how eternal punishment hereafter could accomplish any good end, and therefore I am not able to believe it. To chasten a man in order to perfect him might be reasonable enough; to annihilate him when he shall prove himself incapable of reaching perfection might be reasonable enough; but to roast him forever for the mere satisfaction of seeing him roast would not be reasonable - even for the atrocious God of the Old Testament." My father helped his father die, an act that must have taken great courage. Yet as a Calvinistic Presbyterian, he worried that for this act God might on Judgment Day send him to hell. Hebrews, x, 30-31: "Vengeance belongs to me; I will recompense, said the Lord. And again, the Lord shall judge his people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God." He had read Dante. The more contemporary theists are likely to be free from that fear. Thus death is not so traumatic as it was for my father. For many of them, facing death is unnecessary, even mas- ochistic. Faith is enough. Theism without hell is a most comfort- ing doctrine, enabling the believers to survive the tragic and the horror of death. Sonya in Checkov's Uncle Vanya cries: There is nothing for it. We must go on living! We shall go on liv- ing, Uncle Vanya. We shall live through a long, long chain of days and weary evenings; we shall bear the trials which fate sends us; we shall work for others, both now and in our old age, and have no rest, and when our time comes we shall die without a murmur, and there beyond the grave we shall say that we have suffered, that we have wept, that life has been bitter to us, and God will have pity on us, and you and I, Uncle Vanya, dear Uncle, shall see a life that is bright, lovely, beautiful. We shall rejoice and look back on these troubles of ours with tenderness, with a smile - we shall rest. We shall hear angels, we shall see all earthly evil, all our sufferings, drowned in mercy which will fill the whole world, and our life will be peaceful, gentle and sweet as a caress. I have faith, I have faith.</page><page sequence="7">Facing Death at 80 307 Poor Uncle Vanya, you are crying. You have no joy in your life, but wait Uncle Vanya, wait. We shall rest. It seems presumptuous, even cruel, to question faith like that. Blind faith in dogmas - unquestionable authoritative decrees by "prophets" and religious institutions - shelters and consoles. Be- lief in life after death, according to Jung, is good for our health. For many or most, life is bad enough without shaking the foun- dations of their fundamental beliefs. Recent polls in the United States confirm that a majority believe in God, and a majority of that majority believe in a hereafter. Miguel de Unamuno, the twentieth-century Spanish philosopher: "If there is no immortal- ity, what use is God"? Most Christians seemingly believe that the death of the body is the beginning of a new life in God. Without Jesus death is dreadful, but with Him all is well forever. For those completely content with their faith in God and their immortal souls and their religious beliefs: Read no further! For those not so certain, including Christians whose faith is steeped in persis- tent doubt, remember Socrates's claim: "The unexamined life is not worth living." My first shaking of faith was physical. My Presbyterian father, a long-time Bible teacher, taught me predestination. God is per- fect, omnipotent; therefore He knows every detail of the future; therefore I cannot change what is going to happen. Thus in my naivete I interpreted my father's faith. There were few cars in that wonderful age, and I walked across the streets without cau- tion. What will be, will be. A car smacked Calvinism completely out of me. I remained, however, a tottering theist. At the University of Chicago, I studied the Great Books for two years with Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler. No matter where you started, Adler could always prove the existence of God. For example: If a finite being exists, then an infinite being exists. A finite being exists. Therefore an infinite being exists. Surely I am finite, no question about that. My theism was reinforced. But then I studied some of the Pre-Socratics, especially Protagoras: No species remains constant: the great renovator of matter, Na- ture, endlessly fashions new forms from old; there is nothing in the whole universe that perishes, believe me; rather energy simply renews and varies its forms. What we describe as birth is not more than a change from a prior state, while dying is merely to quit it.</page><page sequence="8">308 SOUNDINGS F. David Martin Though the parts may be transported hither and thither, the sum of all matter is constant. And there is nothing else. This argument is consistent with the Second Law of Thermody- namics, one of the few laws of physics I thought I understood: energy can neither be created nor destroyed. The always persistent Adler trotted out his "Order proof: na- ture has a design so spectacular that there must be a designer. My study of Darwin convinced me that the theory of the Survival of the Fittest completely undermined the Order proof. Adler's last resort, for the stupid and the stubborn, was Pascal's famous wager - and we must wager, according to Pascal. If we wager that God exists, then we achieve infinite gain [heaven] ; if God does not exist, there is no loss. Conversely, if we wager against the existence of God and God does not exist, there is no loss or gain; however, if God does exist, there is infinite loss [damnation]. Hence by wagering for God's existence we have everything to gain and nothing to lose; by wagering against God's existence we have everything to lose and nothing to gain. For me this argument fell flat. The mystery of God's existence was reduced to a problem of logic. Moreover, I could not con- ceive a respectable God condoning such a wager. Surely it is bet- ter to have beliefs about death forged in the fortunes and misfortunes of life, even if such beliefs deny God and afterlife. Paul Tillich kindly helped me with my book on Art and the Re- ligious Experience. For Tillich, if I understood him correctly, all ideas about God are symbolic, except for the literal statement that God exists ("the God above God" in Tillich's terminology). This made sense to me. If I had a student who believed literally that Santa Claus climbed down the chimney, I might have sug- gested a psychiatrist. On the other hand, failing to see the Santa Claus story as symbolic of the care and love of parents seemed blind. Except for the literal claim that God exists, why not believe that all our ideas about God are symbolic? Special revelation made little sense to me. Suppose, as is highly probable, there are millions of planets with self-conscious beings, like or somewhat like us. Special revelation for them also? Poor Christ! And how many Bibles? The following remarks of Steven Weinberg, a Nobel Prize winner, deserve thoughtful consideration:</page><page sequence="9">Facing Death at 80 309 Suppose that calculations showed that the chance of any single planet having surface gravity, temperature, and chemical composi- tion favorable for the appearance of life, and of life actually arising on this planet, and of this life becoming intelligent through natu- ral selection, is no greater than one part in, say a million million. Then with only one planet in the universe it would be difficult without supposing divine intervention to understand our great good fortune in having come to being. Of course, now we know that a good fraction of stars have planets, and that there are at least a hundred billion stars in the universe (perhaps an infinite number), so we need not be surprised that chance events gov- erned by impersonal natural laws have produced intelligent life on at least one of these planets. With these odds, it would be surpris- ing if intelligent life had not appeared. The more I thought about these questions the more aware I became of the mystery of the universe - the unimaginable mag- nitude of space and time, the bewildering interactions of invisi- ble bits of energy, the mind-stupefying phenomena of black holes, etc. It seemed arrogant if not childish to believe that we can know by means of special revelation anything literally about a God who presumably is the cause and controller of our universe (and all possible others). The majestic mystery of the world, except for its existence, is beyond literal meaning; but it is not, so I came to believe, beyond symbolic meaning. Moreover, and most im- portantly, the literal claim that the majestic mystery exists anchors symbols of the majestic mystery to reality. Problems are soluble, at least in theory. The mystery of the universe is not a problem. As answers to problems about the uni- verse multiply, the more the mystery deepens and expands, mag- nificent in its unconquerable indefiniteness. The more we know about the events of our world (as understood by the sciences, the humanities, the arts, and common sense) the more, as Einstein maintained, we know we don't know. Any description or explana- tion of a God that is literal - except for the existence claim - anthropomorphizes God. Darwin loosened God's heavenly grip; Marx pushed God out; and Freud hid God in the unconscious. Nietzsche declared God dead. So I came to believe, also, and moved into agnosticism and then atheism. Within the atheistic boundaries I encountered four main paths: Stoicism (of the pes- simistic species), Epicureanism, Existentialism (of the rebellious species), and Marxism. Except for the last, I wandered around all of them. Although I studied Marx and Engels and found their</page><page sequence="10">310 SOUNDINGS R David Martin theories provocative and occasionally powerful, the conse- quences of Stalinism, especially as revealed in works such as Koestler's Darkness at Noon, blocked my going there. Stoicism accepts our fate as inevitably tragic, commending pas- sivity and resignation. The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius are meditations almost entirely on death. "Everything that belongs to the body is a stream and what belongs to the soul is a dream and vapor, and life is a warfare and a stranger's sojourn, and after fame is oblivion." For Seneca, the wise man accepts the inevita- ble: "Life has been given to us only under the condition of death. It moves toward death. Therefore, it is folly to be afraid of it." When ordered to commit suicide by Nero, Seneca made no ef- fort to escape. He slashed his wrists with equanimity. Death is the physician of all human pain. Death is the ultimate and welcome relief. "Tell me your secret," pleads the protagonist in Bergman's Seventh Seal, who made a pact with Death. "I have no secrets," replies Death, "I am nothing." In Stoicism there is a strong undercurrent of what Freud named the "death instinct" - "the task of which is to lead or- ganic matter back into the inorganic state." There is a craving for death. Thomas Hardy: Religion is an opium for the people. To those suffering pain, hu- miliation, illness, and serfdom, it promised an award in afterlife. And now we are witnessing a transformation. A true opium for the people is a belief in nothingness after death - the huge solace of thinking that for our betrayals, greed, cowardice, murders, we are not to be judged. Edmund Wilson: When you realize that it won't be long before you fade out of life, the activities of so short-lived human beings begin to seem rather futile and the beings themselves flimsy. Does it really matter that much? And all that energy and worry expended on merely getting themselves reproduced. But life grew better for me as I aged, much more "up" than "down." I became more of an Epicurean than a Stoic. Epicurus: "Death, the most dreadful of evils, is nothing to us; for while we are here, death is not, and when death is here, we are not. So death mat- ters neither to the living nor the dead." Have a good time while you have time, and stay young as long as you possibly can. Inten- sity of experience, exhilarating enjoyment of every possible mo-</page><page sequence="11">Facing Death at 80 311 ment, has been my practice for a long time. Extraordinarily fortunate with family, friends, health, and career, I have had a rewarding life. Rousseau: "Life consists less in length than in the keen sense of living. A man may be buried at one hundred and never have lived at all. Intensity of experience is what we are looking for." However, as old age advances, that intensity weakens. As Epicureans age, their life style almost necessarily changes. Epicureans are likely to become Stoics towards the end. Stephen Crane: However much may remain that is greatly worth seeing and hear- ing, one gradually slips into a state of grateful certainty that one has seen and heard enough. And when you come to the hedge that we all must go over, it isn't so bad. You feel sleepy and you don't care. Just a little drowsy anxiety, which world you are really in - that's all. Seneca: "There is, believe me, great happiness in the very neces- sity of dying." Not a bad move - the Epicurean turning to Stoi- cism. It is a little like the dedicated sinner who confesses all at the end, and all is well. Cop-out? Epicureanism is inherently self-cen- tered, mingled, as Tolstoy noted in My Confession, with considera- ble moral obtuseness, particularly sins of omission. Rebellious Existentialism is a more recent path of atheism. Al- bert Camus's hero Sisyphus (Everyman) defies the horrors of human existence, and thus is condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder up a mountain, follow it down, and continue the process. If Sisyphus gives in, he no longer would have grounds for complaining about an irrational, hostile world, completely out-of-whack with human needs. He would then accept that human hopes can never be achieved, that we never can get into harmony with the world. It is an absurd relationship. We either defy or submit. With courageous defiance we at least maintain dignity and even, with heroes like Sisyphus, nobility. The Doctor in Camus's The Plague continues his utterly hope- less ministrations. Unlike the Stoic, he refuses to give in to death. No one has expressed this defiance more powerfully than Dylan Thomas: Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rage at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</page><page sequence="12">312 SOUNDINGS F. David Martin Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words have forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night. And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. The unsuccessful Epicurean may consistently embrace defi- ance in old age. But such a turn for a successful Epicurean ap- pears intolerably ungrateful for the gift of life, even though - painful thought - it may be that in facing death the most unfor- tunate sort of misfortune is to have been happy. The path of Exis- tentialism throughout life is principled; a shift from successful Epicureanism into the path of Existentialism in old age is to ac- cept one's past as fraudulent. In any case, the Existentialist sees only or mainly the dark side of human existence. That narrow- ness of vision, although justifiably focusing on such horrors as the Holocaust, seemed to me blind to a more complete picture. None of the paths of atheism beckon me now. Nor do the paths of theism. As I grew older these passages, especially the theistic ones, struck me as both narrow and without outlets. I wanted a wider, more open path. In one species of pantheism, I have found a way that seems authentic, sad but not dreadful, comforting without the illusions and arrogance of dogma. Per- haps it is a way that can be helpful to others. The path is twisting, and I'm not certain I can describe it clearly, but it is not crowded. It could be named: "To the Holy without the Ghost." III. Memory Voluntary and Involuntary A little wave, bobbling along in the ocean, is having a grand old time. He's enjoying the wind and the fresh air - until he notices the other waves in front of him, crashing against the shore. "My God, this is terrible," the wave says. "Look what's going to happen to me!" Then along comes another wave. It sees the first wave, looking grim, and says to him, "Why do you look so sad?" The first wave says, 'You don't understand! We're all going to crash! All of us waves are going to be nothing. Isn't it terrible?" The second wave says, "No you don't understand. You're not a wave, you're part of the ocean." (Mitch Albon, Tuesdays with Morrie)</page><page sequence="13">Facing Death at 80 313 By definition, voluntary memory occurs through an act of will. I summon up the name of a student whom I haven't seen in years. Involuntary memory occurs when a memory emerges un- willed. I remember without effort that student's brilliance in class. The basic differences between voluntary and involuntary memories, and their often highly complex interactions, are cru- cial to an understanding of the path to the holy. Recently I was in the National Museum of Art in Budapest. Af- ter "doing" the main floor, I wanted to check out an exhibition of Hungarian art on the basement floor. Bad knees requested an elevator. I found one in a remote area with very thick doors, pushed the lowest button, and descended. I could not get the doors open. Nothing moved. There was no alarm signal that I could read. There was no red button. I tried every number, then every possible combination, again and again. I screamed and pounded. (Later I was told that I was in a service lift that might go unnoticed for days.) Somewhat claustrophobic to begin with, I panicked. Having given up with the buttons, and resigned to periodic yelling and pounding, an entombed death, however bizarre, appeared re- motely possible. Strangely, after hours that seemed days, a calm came, miracles of memory, especially involuntary, saturated my mind and lessened my terror: my father's fear of being buried alive; a scene from Bergman's Wild Strawberries of an old man dreaming of himself laid out in a tilting coffin; the time when I was a very amateur scuba diver and one of my tank lines got caught on a beam of an old shipwreck forty feet below the sur- face of the ocean; the time when as a child I got separated from my parents in New York City; recent MRI's in torpedo-like tubes with their crashing blasts; and on and on and on. My will had little to do with the flow of memories. They just happened. The futility of doing anything about those gates of hell walled off the future, yet opened the gates of the past. At the end of my longest day, a janitor came. Being aware of death as imminent, especially if one faces death squarely, draws and organizes memories, like a powerful magnet that draws metal filings into a single file. Or to put it another way, facing death is a little like the one-point perspective of fif- teenth-and sixteenth-century Renaissance painting. In Leo- nardo's Last Supper, the lines of floor, walls, and ceiling move</page><page sequence="14">314 SOUNDINGS F. David Martin toward a point - called nicely the "vanishing point" - in the misty landscape framed by a window behind the head of Christ. Everything in the painting, except the "stuff on the table, is re- lated in more or less geometric fashion to those converging lines. If extended, those lines (orthogonals) would meet somewhere in the far distance. Even though the memories that filled my con- sciousness in that hellish lift were for the most part unwilled - involuntary - they were not unorganized. They lined up not only because most of them were associated with claustrophobia, but, more importantly, all of them were related to a common endpoint: death. Eliminating that prospect probably would have kept some of those memories hidden - especially the non-claus- trophobic ones such as losing my parents in New York - and certainly would have eliminated a "one-point" orientation. All kinds of association were at play, no doubt, but death was the ultimate association that like a compass guided them all. More or less unorganized memories, especially the involun- tary, may flood our minds, as when we are in a contemplative or day-dreaming mood. Often there is little rhyme or reason for their surfacing and compounding, except that one image tends to provoke another because of some likeness. When death on the horizon is faced, that ultimate and mental gravitational pull draws the past, like a story taking shape, into a more meaningful structure. Aging brings the horizon continually closer, strength- ening the shaping narrative. Before my Budapest trauma, I had ignored or suppressed most of my memories of claustrophobia, and when they did surface there was no pattern. During my trauma, those flashbacks were bound together. Afterwards I had something of a grip on them, purged to some extent of their frightfulness. Something Like a Poem I had learned, in that dark coffin of a lift, something valuable about death, although perhaps understandable only to the old and to those like Keats who know they will die young. When death is focused on a near horizon, the reliving of the past in an ordered way becomes more possible. Rather than having the past experienced randomly or simply used in the present to serve the future, the "past-filling-present" reveals something of ourselves to ourselves. Like an axe, involuntary memory under the power and</page><page sequence="15">Facing Death at 80 315 direction of death breaks the frozen sea in us. Awareness of death helps bring memories to the surface, and facing death - hard , straight thinking about it - may produce an intelligible totality, something like a poem. The movements of memories then are like self-developing Polaroids in which disparate images gradually assemble themselves, sometimes resolving into an epiphany, a flash of insight, a revelation of something, something about who we are. We need insights about ourselves, and facing death is one of the most important opportunities. Locking one- self into a rarely-used lift is certainly not to be recommended, but the analysis of that kind of experience may help us understand the supreme importance of facing death. Not all memories, even within the context of thinking about death, lend themselves to self-revelation. Many memories are triv- ial. And tightly associated memories, even the involuntary and the non-trivial, can become boring or annoying. On a moonlit night in St. Mark's Square in Venice many years ago, I chanced on a dance rehearsal using excerpts from the music of Mahler. Venice invariably recalls Mahler, and vice versa. The Venice-to- Mahler memory has become boring because of its repetitiveness. When listening to great music, I find that I prefer the aural with- out the visual. Memories also can be painful, as with my memories of the Bu- dapest lift. But there is an aura of nostalgia that eases the pain; and involuntary memories, except for the trivial and the habitual ones, carry the charm of spontaneity. However dull we may be, our memories are our own, often astonishing, surprising, and fresh. Moreover, our involuntary memories, because they escape the sieve of practicality, are more complete usually than the vol- untary, giving more of ourselves. Voluntary memories tend to be wide, like the never-ending Internet. Involuntary memories tend to be narrower, deeper, more intrinsically interesting. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why so many elders disdain computers. Every memory misses something or changes something. The past is never captured "pure." With the voluntary, we usually be- come conscious of only that part of the past that serves our prac- tical purposes. I bring up the name and address of that Budapest janitor in order to communicate my gratitude. I don't need any- thing more because I don't expect to be in Budapest again. As Proust suggests, much of our past, while open to involuntary</page><page sequence="16">316 SOUNDINGS E David Martin memory, is shut to the voluntary or what he called "intellectual memory." Voluntary memory can only bring to consciousness what is assumed to be present in our unconscious. Moreover, be- ing consciously selective, voluntary memories are much more re- stricted than the involuntary. On the other hand, the involuntary are much more compromised than the voluntary when there is a narration. And, of course, involuntary memories become volun- tary in the "telling." Most of us like to hear or read good stories, and many of us like to tell stories. To heighten the narrative effect, we may change, often unconsciously, the memories. For example, about twenty years ago I wrote a poem about an incident that occurred over seventy years ago, one that had haunted me for a long time. Bringing my guilt to light relieved some of my burden. MY LAST FIGHT Fall of nineteen twenty-nine and I was nine. Neighbor Jack was ten, taller but thin. His father, very kind to me, was suffering market misery. Jack and I argued about a pen. Boys circled in. Flailing for honor's sake, my fist felt a break. Blood gushed especially red. Like a matador, preening, yet sensing dread That night Jack's father shot himself dead. A few years after writing that poem, I met Jack at a high school reunion. I knew he was coming, and anxiously showed him what I had written, hoping he would understand my feelings. He was gracious. He did understand, but he noted: his father's suicide occurred a week after the fight. I had unknowingly distorted my memory to make a more interesting poem. My memories of that fight as I composed the poem were voluntary for the most part. I knew that they were there, for I had occasionally thought of them over the years, and I was fairly certain of their accuracy. However, the "willing" also had triggered involuntary memories, such as the when and how of the suicide. The voluntary memo-</page><page sequence="17">Facing Death at 80 31 7 ries had created a context in which the involuntary were given a chance to come forth. These involuntary memories were essen- tial to the story, although not as accurate as the voluntary, and this seems to be the case generally. Like snapshots, voluntary memories have an "age-thickness" about them, layered closely by tight associations. Involuntary memories are more like the mov- ing images of film, lighter, shifting, energizing our imaginations more, and thus more subject to distortion. Nevertheless, when facing death, our composing of even involuntary memories tends to be guided by the need to get to the truth. Memory Boxes Memories cluster around something of interest. An object that rivets our attention, perhaps a work of art we love, stimulates and structures our memories. For most of the non-elderly there is no further structuring. But for most of the elderly, their awareness of death is the underbeating rhythm of their lives - a drumming that links the clusters of memory into more meaningful harmo- nies. Even the elderly who avoid thinking about death are still very aware of death. And this awareness gives some centralizing power to their memories. My guess is that although the organiza- tion of their memories is much weaker generally than that of their contemporaries who face death, the organization is much stronger than for the non-elderly. In any case, short-term mem- ory usually weakens with aging: "I've already told you that three times." Conversely, long-term memory usually strengthens. Before old age we live forward, needing especially our immediate past to solve immediate problems. In old age we are more likely to live backward, savoring and evaluating especially our long-ago pasts. Moreover long-time memory, especially the involuntary, may move into areas rarely if ever explored before, a process that can be exciting and rewarding. Watch the elderly, even the es- capists: the wonder and excitement as they open old letters or memory boxes or family albums or go back to reunions or the cemetery or just talk about the old days. Guided by a feeling of finality memories can be transparent, one memory leading to an- other and on and on, sometimes remembering something never remembered before. Don't be so sure that glazed eyes are a sign of senility. Whereas the young usually and rapidly become bored</page><page sequence="18">318 SOUNDINGS F. David Martin with such agitations of the past, the old, especially when they are together, often are hard to stop. Shared memories bond us with others, especially family and friends. My wife and I met in high school, our "here and now" always and increasingly enriched by our communions of mem- ory. We rarely have missed our high-school reunions. "And who is that?" The story telling is rampant, the plots revised, memories buzzing like summer insects. "That is what happened." "No, that's not the way it was." The rebirth with others of what hap- pened (or something like it) can be intoxicating as we age. It is a recapturing of something about who we were (and are), helped by those who were there. Those pilgrimages across the past strengthen both a personal and social identity. The memories shared in a social context seem to be overwhelmingly voluntary, becoming amplified and exalted while leaping from mind to mind. Involuntary memories are more likely to require recollec- tion in tranquility. Yet, as Shakespeare sings, voluntary memories may also need silence: "When to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up remembrances of things past. ..." Hector at Mogadishu Shared memories can drift back beyond "living memories," even back to the beginnings of civilization. In the "collective un- conscious," as postulated by Jung, the more or less recurrent and extraordinary events of history leave memory traces in the brain. If Jung is correct, then we have direct access to and thus some information about the events and the accompanying hopes and fears of those who lived them. Jung's speculation may be false. Nevertheless, memories of great historical events are preserved in legends and myths, and in epics such as The Iliad, The Odyssey, and The Aeneid. Because of its vast temporal depth, such remem- bering can be extremely poignant, especially when mythical memories resonate closely with current events. Remember, for example, those sickening scenes on television of the body of a U.S. Ranger being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. In The Iliad, Achilles binds the body of Hector behind his war char- iot, "lashed his horses to speed, and they both flew on. And dust rose around him that was dragged, and his dark hair flowed loose on either side, and in the dust lay all his once fair head." Such</page><page sequence="19">Facing Death at 80 319 events generate a sense of the oneness of humanity even in its cruelty. Involuntary memories, much more than the voluntary, stimu- late others, particularly when death is near. Quentin Compson in Faulkner's The Sound and The Fury has planned his suicide with precision. There is no uncertainty about his resolution. As he goes to his destiny, there is absolutely no future. His suicide within a few hours is even closely timed, its image functioning like a mirror, reflecting and connecting a wide range of sorrow- ful involuntary memories. On the other hand, his brother Jason, a business man, is obsessed with money. Future-dominated, Jason has no time for involuntary memories. Most of us are somewhere between those extremes. As we age, involuntary memories be- come increasingly prevalent, among other reasons because we have more time to meditate. Our interior landscape broadens and, if we face death, becomes more orderly. Maybe as an old man even Jason would have succumbed. If not, his tombstone might be inscribed: "Big Waste of Time." Usually some event - such as Proust's tasting the madeleine cake dipped in tea - triggers involuntary memory by association, by some kind of likeness. Sometimes, however, involuntary mem- ories spring from unconscious depths that we cannot fathom, as often with dreams. Sometimes apparitions float up that pretend to be memories. For example, I had heard many times when I was very young the family story that while pushing my buggy on our high porch my sister slipped and I plunged down twenty steps or so landing in a deep snow bank miraculously unhurt. I came to believe for years, without giving it any thought, that I remembered images of my dramatic descent, but surely I was mis- taken - I was only two or less. Apparitions and especially dreams, however false to facts, have taken on a more narrative character as I have aged. I rarely remember my dreams, but inva- riably when I do there is a script. If awareness of death is present, and especially if faced, invol- untary memories, whatever their sources, tend to form distinct groupings. I have involuntary memory lines of all kinds: family, friends, the arts, the comic, the tragic, the "sins" of commission, the "sins" of omission, sickness, embarrassment, joy, triumph, failure, travel, tennis, golf, swimming, etc., etc., the entire pano- rama of my life. While voluntary memories may contribute, they</page><page sequence="20">320 SOUNDINGS F. David Martin seem to be completely dominated by the involuntary. In any case, death as faced is the mirror in which the meaning of my life is reflected. Memories vary in intensity. Even when otherwise very dissimi- lar, their similar intensity levels may lead to grouping. There was the time in tenth-grade geometry when a sexy girl was exposed a little bit and I was called to the blackboard in a state of unseemly excitement, and the time I was daydreaming at a faculty meeting and on being called upon by the President made no comment even slightly relevant to the issue. Invariably if I remember the one, I remember the other. Although daydreaming and public exposure were involved in both, similar intensity also seems to be part of the explanation. Occasionally my memory lines cross, like veins, unlike Leo- nardo's orthogonals. During World War II I was almost court- martialed for disobeying a stupid and brutal order by my com- manding officer. Those tragic-line memories sometimes connect with my friend-line memories. Because of that situation, I met the man who became my closest friend. Only in recent years have I experienced with any consistency what for me are marvelous lines of recall, especially of the invol- untary kind. Facing death more often and more leisure time to contemplate have made such rich moments more possible. Some lines, such as my embarrassment line, are fun to remember, even to write about. Other lines, such as my tragic line, are purged of their sufferings to some extent. Others penetrate almost eighty years, to the deepest depths of my being. Because so rare, they are the most priceless. Sometimes some of these lines bind to- gether, their knotting compounding their interest and ex- panding my self-understanding. Pearl Harbor and Comiske Park Involuntary memories can evoke the voluntary. As I was writing about my escape from a court martial, my memories were based on the involuntary. Now I am trying to remember the name of my commanding officer, although I really do not know why, un- less it may be to test my weakening mental capacities. Conversely, voluntary memories can evoke the involuntary. When I call to mind being caught in a typhoon in the Pacific during World War II, the uncalled-for memory of nearly being drowned in a rip-tide</page><page sequence="21">Facing Death at 80 321 off Bali often comes along. The evocative power of involuntary memories seems to be considerably greater than that of the vol- untary ones. Time is usually more pressing with the voluntary, cutting off chain reactions. Involuntary memories are more the foundation and the structure of one's past. Voluntary memories are more the furnishings. Nevertheless, for the most part there is a mixing: the magic lantern of memory projects kaleidoscopic beams of the involuntary and the voluntary, as in the composing of "My Last Fight." Or, to relate another example, I often have recalled voluntarily - for it was an interesting tale I liked to tell - the cold dark day of December 7, 1941. I was in Comiske Park in Chicago watching a professional football game. Near the end of the game there was an astonishing announcement that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I remember rushing back to the University for confirmation and the excited conversations with my fraternity brothers about our options. The game be- tween the Chicago Cardinals and the Detroit Lions was com- pletely blacked out. Many years later I happened to read that Byron White was retiring from the Supreme Court. Suddenly the dense fog cleared: the Whizzer had played for the Lions that af- ternoon, as I involuntarily recalled. The reservoirs of memory are enormous, constantly being filled, yet little drained, most of the contents forgotten. Involuntary memory is the main pipeline back into the reservoir. I suspect that most of us have repressed memories that rarely, if ever, get tapped. When they do occur, they are almost invaria- bly involuntary. For example, when I was five or six I watched my mother, an accomplished actress, playing Lady Macbeth. I had no memory of that performance until a few years ago when I accidentally cut my hands. Suddenly it came back - the terrible sight of my mother rubbing her reddened hands, and my terror. I am certain that I have other "mummified memories" hidden away, but I have no way of getting to them except to wait for an unforeseen access. Although obviously such memories are un- pleasant, they are invaluable. They help fill out my story. Memories associate sometimes because of a common space, what might be called "place memories." My memory of Comiske Park and Pearl Harbor triggered the memory of Joe Dimaggio and his fifty-six game hitting streak. By July (I think), 1941, he had hit in forty or so consecutive games. Comiske Park was</page><page sequence="22">322 SOUNDINGS F. David Martin jammed, and I remember that he had made outs his first two at bats. The drama was rising, and I can still see his line double between the left fielder and the center fielder. I have no other memory of that day except that, as with my Pearl Harbor mem- ory, I remember exactly where I was sitting. Memories also associate sometimes because of a common time, what might be called "epochal memories." Thus many of my high-school reunion memories link with those of my classmates because we belonged to the same era. Epochal memories with their wide temporal dimensions (four years in my example) are usually much more conducive to group sharing than the nar- rower place memories. Many of us shared our four-year high school. Only a couple of friends were with me in Comiske Park on those two occasions. Epochal memories can spread almost the length of a lifetime. Practically everyone of my generation recalls precisely the mo- ments of Pearl Harbor, D-Day, Roosevelt's death, the end of WW II, JFK's, Bobby's, and King's assassinations. The sharing of those events, which only my generation possesses in an unqualified way, binds us together. "Thnking At" and "Thinking From" We can either "think at" or "think from" something. Many years ago a fellow Fulbright scholar and I received permission to visit for a couple of hours the Acton collection in a handsome villa outside Florence. He was studying the changes in size of the haloes in Italian Renaissance painting, and I was studying Renais- sance portraiture. On leaving, I enthusiastically referred to the extraordinary beauty of the blue in the background of one of Botticelli's portraits. I was so taken by this work that it had ab- sorbed all my attention for a considerable time. Nothing had come into my consciousness that had not been initiated and con- trolled by the portrait. For a while I was united with the Botticelli, my consciousness was so saturated, especially with the blue, that I had no room for thoughts about myself as distinct from the painting. My ego went to the backseat. I was absorbed in "think- ing from." I had "participated" with the Botticelli. My colleague, on the other hand, had measured Botticelli's haloes with great care. He had missed the blueness of that blue. His "thinking at,"</page><page sequence="23">Facing Death at 80 323 however useful for his book, had blinded him except for the de- tails he was analyzing. His book was published. I "think at" voluntary memories, try to bring them to con- sciousness. They appear opposite to me, separate, depersonal- ized to some extent, "force-fired." I am much more likely to "think from" involuntary memories. They come on their own, bubbling up like water from hidden springs. If they flood, steer- ing everything or almost everything in my mind, the memories think in me. I then do not dominate the past; the past dominates me. I surrender to my past. I am my memory, just as I am the music when its flowing completely captures me. I can "think from" all kind of events, of course. What I have called the "participative experience" - the undivided and sus- tained attention to an object or event that makes us lose our sense of separation from that object or event - is one of the most satisfying of experiences. Love, poem, mountain, forest, brook, goldenrod, even a blade of grass can also capture us that way. Yet in old age perhaps nothing invites participation as much as the deep treasures of involuntary memories that surface and jell. Involuntary memories are us in a way nothing else is. As they come from the invisible, they help outline and fill in our self- image. Instead of the Cartesian "I think therefore I am," I re- member therefore I am. Despite catastrophes, "sins" of commis- sion and omission, guilt, shame, and sorrow, it can be an invaluable satisfaction to bring our past together meaningfully, abstracting the fundamentally important. If we are prepared - quiet, attentive - a pin can implode the inner mind. Speak, memory! And if we continue to "think from" our memories, ac- cept them with creative hospitality, we are at one with ourselves. No other experiences can begin to bring this sense of identity. We are at home in our homeland. A Library Burns Down Facing death cuts out trivialities, helps bring order out of chaos (even if only to recognize the chaos), and creates some sense of continuity in our lives. Tame time! Form the past - still, cool, clean, a "soul-making," our true heritage! We owe it to our- selves, especially the elderly, to recover our story. Story-making heals. It closes as well as discloses. Everyone has an interesting story. There is an African proverb: "When an old man dies, a</page><page sequence="24">324 SOUNDINGS F. David Martin library burns down." Of course it is easy to remember in bad faith - sugarcoating or twisting the facts or detouring around the hid- den. Our stories then at best become sentimental journeys, fairy tales. Much worse, we may falsify, edit our stories into self-decep- tions and self-justifications. The inclusion of the "might-have- beens," on the other hand, the bright-false starts, the roads we did not take, the "unrealized possibilities," is certainly justified. Recollection of the actual versus the possible is always enriching, provided the "might-have-beens" do not become the "has beens," for then our imaginings become our lies. However, death on the near horizon beckons us toward authenticity. The closeness makes possible our last chance to get things straight, our "final arrangements" of even our most unforgivable failings, our Last Judgment. IV. Earth, Sky, Mortals, Gods Tagore: "Oh, dip my emptied life into the ocean, plunge it into the deepest fullness. Let me for once feel that lost sweet touch in the allness of the universe." The resonating sense of identity for me - because of my broadening, deepening, and organizing memories - is not, par- adoxically, a narcissistic closing of the world within. Rather there is a widening feel of connection with other things - flowing into me like a tide. And that communion, in turn, has greatly intensi- fied my awareness of being a part of the universe, the majestic mystery, the sacred, the holy - the "I Thou," as Buber puts it, rather than the "I it." The cosmos is charged with grandeur. The great wave to the tiny wave, 'You're part of the ocean." My grave will be everywhere. Inside and outside interpenetrate - the ebb and flow are one. Time without inwardness loses the outwardness. The majestic mystery is not just the apparent infinite spread of apparent infi- nite things, it is also their unity, the likeness of things unlike. Despite the splendid singularity of things, they create some kind of totality beyond our comprehension. Alfred North Whitehead's philosophy, for me, comes closest to a systematic explanation of this "oneness." Martin Heidegger's philosophy comes closest to a more intuitive explanation. The four members of the Heidegger- ian world - earth, sky, mortals, and gods - depend on each other, yet each is what it is only in relation to the other three.</page><page sequence="25">Facing Death at 80 325 Thus as mortals we could not live without earth and sky; without awareness of our mortality we would be like animals without any sense of the gods. I used to come closest to awareness of the majestic mystery while swimming in the ocean, especially at the edge of safety. Im- mersion in churning waves, spicy spray, burning sun and cool- blue sky, a wheeling gull or two whistling their thin screams, and the slight danger made me feel dependent on and part of an incomprehensible power - the sacred. Now I stay within safer boundaries, in sight of my footprints in the sand being effaced by little waves with soft white hands. Now there is a serener sense of cosmic communion. Long before I understood what was going on, I sometimes ex- perienced the majestic mystery (what I then called a mystical ex- perience) of certain masterpieces of art. In Art and the Religious Expérience, I tried to to describe the inexhaustibility of great art. I have listened to Bach's Mass in B Minor many times. Start me any place and I can pick up immediately where we are and what fol- lows. Surely this should be boring after many listenings. Not so. The music continually suggests tones that are not played. Almost all music suggests tones that follow what has sounded, just as the words: "I am going to the United . . . ." implies that "States" will follow. Music that is less than a masterpiece "realizes" (plays out) its possibilities, more or less. Most possibilities are sounded or realized. Such music, no matter how lovely, tends to become bor- ing after repeated hearings. We know its structure and its pos- sibilities. There are no more surprises. Great music, on the other hand, goes further by throwing up possibilities that not only are not sounded but continually evoke further possibilities. Bach's Mass continually brings something new, not to the outer ear but to the inner ear. The aura of inexhaustible unrealized possibili- ties that surrounds any masterpiece of art (that is why it is a mas- terpiece) symbolizes the inexhaustibility of the majestic mystery. And when we "think from" that work of art we are in the direct presence of the majestic mystery. This is the basis - the root revelation - for the literal claim that the majestic mystery or sacred exists. When we "think at" the majestic mystery, as I have been doing in this essay, I am outside, observing. When I "think from" the majestic mystery, I am within, participating.</page><page sequence="26">326 SOUNDINGS F. David Martin In old age I can feel the majestic mystery almost everywhere, both in nature and in created works. I have more time now to calm down, to meditate, to savor what I have been missing. Deep- down silence especially, like that of John Cage, makes possible a favorable environment in which the rhythm of things can be felt - the hearing loss that comes with age has that exceptional com- pensation. The majestic mystery can be sensed in "natural sym- bols," particularly those that suggest the sublime, such as the Milky Way, the hurricane, and the Grand Canyon. In created things, such as artistic masterpieces, "created symbols" also can open the door to the majestic mystery. But to get through the door, we must always "think from" the symbols, whether natural or created. If we get through to the "presencing" of the majestic mystery, we inevitably react with ecstatic wonder, celebration. We have received a gift of grace. We know that we have been at home in the holy for awhile. We know it because we directly ex- perienced it - felt it. Intense bodily sensations usually accom- pany the epiphany. Chills sometimes run up and down my spine when the soprano breaks out in the high passages in Verdi's Re- quiem; Picasso's Guernica wrenches my gut; and Shakespeare's Sonnet LXXIII brings tears. The dazzling scenes of nature make almost everyone throb with excitement. The powerful moments of life, such as sex, birth, and death, make us shake. Even partici- pation with little things, such as a shell on a beach, can pull the sense of our bodies beyond the surface of our skins, making us aware of being-in-the-world, "decentering" us from our usual mode of "I it." Still, it is the big epiphanies that bring us most securely into the sacred. Only we - tiny as we are among the great giants of nature - possess the miraculous power of awe-ful awareness. In a passage from "Inside the River," James Dickey has beauti- fully expressed what I have been trying to say: Let the flowing create A new inner being: As the source in the mountain Gives water in pulses, These can be felt at The heart of the current And here it is only One wandering step Forth, to the sea.</page><page sequence="27">Facing Death at 80 327 Your freed hair floating Out of your brain. "Let the flowing create" symbolizes the power of the sacred. No dowser branch is needed. "A new inner being" refers to our sense of being-in-the-world, our participation with that power. The "water in pulses, these can be felt" refers to the rhythmic charac- ter of one's surrender to the sacred. The rhythm of the participa- tive experience is controlled by what we are "thinking from," rather than being imposed as in "thinking at." The pulsations of participation tend to be compressed and intense, because their beginnings and endings, unlike most non-participatory exper- iences, are usually clearly bracketed. "The heart of the current" suggests the big epiphany, making possible the implied little rev- elations occurring in the eddies (such as the shell on the beach) of the pulsing main stream. "Forth, to the sea" is the recognition that participation is the pathway to the sacred. Our awareness of the big epiphany is so somatically ecstatic that "freed hair" seems "floating out of your brain." Minute as we are, and in death no longer conscious, we are never annihilated. We do not die completely. There is not a total severance from the world. We are part of the sacred. We are in our progeny. We are in the memories of others. Self-conscious- ness can bring with it a degree of separation from everything, especially and unfortunately from the sacred. Marvelous thinkers that we are, we may deny the sacred by turning it into some kind of anthropomorphic version of ourselves. Michelangelo's God giving life to Adam on the center of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel - as a symbolic depiction of the sacred it is sublime; as a literal depiction of the sacred it is a lie, however well-meaning, beautiful, and wondrous. The abolition of consciousness in death abolishes completely and finally our presumed separation from the sacred - the unimaginable sublimity of things and their totality. Walt Whit- man: "As he sees the farthest he has most faith. His thoughts are praise of things. Did you suppose there could be only one Su- preme Being? We affirm that there can be unnumbered Suprêmes, that one does not countervail the other." To know that what is impenetrable to us really exists, that in death we re- main a part of that majestic mystery - that helps bring comfort with final acceptance. Participation with the sacred is, for me, the</page><page sequence="28">328 SOUNDINGS E David Martin religious experience. And that exaltation is the source of my faith that - no matter the circumstances - I can be at peace with death. Will I be able to practice what I "preach" - at the end? I am not certain. I pray that my oneness with the sacred will give me courage, as well as the wisdom that old age is supposed to bring. I don't want to die, but I don't want to agonize about not dying. To die quickly from a heart attack would not be so bad. But I would prefer to die slowly, consciously, in character, and as pain- lessly as possible. I dream, in a corny way, that my Big Event will be just me: without hallucinations, home in my own bed with billowing pillows, wearing an elegant dressing gown with my fa- vorite, hideous golf cap on top, free of "grief therapists," fragrant flowers around, able to see from my bedroom the Susquehanna River and my sacred Montour mountain, the Requiem of Mozart in the background, Proust's Remembrance of Things Past at hand, my good copy of Vermeer's View of Delft on the wall, pretending to be the "Wise Old Man," imagining the reactions to my humor- ous (I trust) last tape made for my funeral, dictating my Epitaph for my Noguchi-like stone under the oak, dispensing like Polo- nius advice to family and friends, donating organs (if any are use- ful), ordering cremation, suggesting a very private funeral and a celebratory wake, sweet good-byes, hugs, and finally darkness, and silence, a softly encompassing sleep, rhythmic like the ocean, a letting go into the sacred. Neither bang nor whimper. But per- haps, I fear, it may be dashing red lights and blasting sirens, blur- ring painful consciousness, the hospital room with empty chairs around my bed, the bell and nurse out of reach. I suspect that most of us, particularly the elderly, fear the dying much more than the death. Dr. Johnson observed that we con- found "annihilation which is nothing, with the apprehension of it, which is dreadful. It is in the apprehension of it that the hor- ror of annihilation consists." The pitiless pain - tubes, tanks, drugs, injections, nausea, and loss of seeing, hearing, and tasting, the choking, shortness of breath, smell of hospital, fitful sleep, objective doctors, starched nurses, loss of rationality, depression, black doubt, and above all the wrenching death throes are dread- ful to contemplate. If faced with such horror, and there is no hope, surely suicide or assisted suicide is justified. For those in the last chords of the coda, with dissonance grating and grind-</page><page sequence="29">Facing Death at 80 329 ing, it should not even be a question. Auden: "To wish you long, long years would be heartless (may you leave when you want to, no earlier)." In any case, it should be our decision, certainly not that of dogmatists or politicians. Facing death if life is reasonably happy should energize the satisfactions of the present. The ending of the future makes the time we have left all the more precious. Dying is the most per- sonal event of our lives; no one can accomplish it for us. Al- though we can witness our dying, we cannot witness our death. Paradoxically, however, we die alone with others, for we know that everyone has died or will die. Death is totally communal. That sharing of the living with the dead and the universe is the ultimate love relationship. That sharing even bonds some believ- ers. Thus, the distinguished philosopher Nicholas Rescher in Phi- losophers Who Believe. It was not dogmas that drew me to Catholicism but an inner need of a sort that is difficult to describe. It was not a need for relief from a sense of sin, nor a need for relief from the intimations of mortality. Rather, it was a need for relief from a sense of isolation - the desire to feel oneself part of a wider community of spirits who are in some degree kindred, who share with oneself a sense of values and priorities geared to the spiritual dimension of our spe- cies and to a sense of human insignificance in the awesome face of the mysteries of our existence. No one can be sure, except the Quentin Compsons, when death will happen. Thus John Calvin advises, humorously for once: "We should have one foot in the air, so to speak." Nor can we be sure how it is going to go. But we can be aware of our union with the sacred, the power that permeates the universe, for nothing abets "thinking from" more than living the final end. Participation with the sacred, the most comforting of all religious experiences, generates love, compassion, and courage. We are part of a universal drama, both as actors and spectators. We alone of all creatures on this earth can contemplate the cosmos and recognize our fragile but certain and active inclusion. De- spite our sense of insignificance in the face of the mysteries of our existence - we belong! Dying should be and with luck can be done with dignity. Pre- paring for that luck requires facing death some time, at best a long time, before the Big Event. E.M. Forster: "Death destroys a man; the idea of Death saves him." We can be "Janus-like," for in</page><page sequence="30">330 SOUNDINGS E David Martin facing death we also are looking back. We achieve some sense of completion. The more complete, the less the fear of death. That is why the old - other things being equal - find death less fear- some than the young. The old possess this great advantage: we have a longer memory and a more organized range of memory, making possible a more meaningful and fulfilling history. Of course, no personal completion will ever be wholly intelligible and harmonious; reality is far too messy for that, but that very recognition makes possible a realistic approach to the ideal. The old know better than the young what is important. We are more ourselves than ever before. Old age can be like the coda of a sonata-form, a final recapitu- lation. Paradise for the elderly is not so much what is happening but, as with Proust, remembering what happened. And when death comes, we don't have to do anything - a reassuring thought - for death will be done for us. We elderly are in winter. "Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang." There may be no song of spring. But we have our music too - melodies of memory bringing us home into the Holy.</page></plain_text>
