<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETER WINCH I. UNDERSTANDING AND EXPLAINING IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES B ERTAIN KINDS of explanation of human behaviour made in non- { scientific contexts involve the use by the explainer of concepts which are also possessed by the persons whose behaviour is being explained. For instance, I say of someone: " His reason for cancelling next week's lecture is that he intends going to London for a conference." The intelligibility of this explanation is conditional on the fact that the concepts used in it-canceUing, next week, givixg lectures, going to Londoare in general understood by the person who is cancelling his lectures; though he need not of course necessarily have consciously employed them on this particular occasion. Explanations of the behaviour of natural objects obviously cannot share this characteristic, since it is only of human beings that we can intelligibly say that they are in possession of concepts. FurtherJ there are many kinds of explanation of human behaviour which do not share this characteristic: an example would be a biological principle such as " human beings eat in order to maintain their metabolism". People eat even if they do not under- stand what " metabolism" means, and this in no way affects the validity of the above explanation. Now explanations in the more developed social sciences are obviously not on the same level as are common-sense explanations such as my first example. The social occurrences explained will not have been intended by the members of the society whose actions led up to them, neither will the concepts used in the explanations be immediately intelligible to those agents. Nevertheless, they are not for that reason closely analogous to those natural scientific examples to which I havve already referred. For they will inrrolve a reference to social activities, and it is part of what is meant by the expression, { social activity", that the concepts used to describe such an activity must also be possessed by those who perform it since to say of someone that he is performing such an activity entails saying of him that he is in possession of such concepts. This is not to confuse the performance of an activity with talking and thinking about its performance, but to draw attention to two important facts. Social Science</page><page sequence="2">PETER Wl N CH I9 (I) A person can be said to be perfortning a specific social activity on a given occasion only if he belongs to a society in which the performance of at least the general kind of activity, e.g. playing games, religious worship, the use of money, is an established institution, and if his behaviour shows that he understands what is involved in doing that kind of thing. To show that one understands what is involved in game-playing is to show that one possesses the concept game. In one society a set of actions performed by a group of people might constitute a game of hide-and-seek; in another society a superficially identical set of actions might constitute a religious rite; and in a society where it did not fall under any concept recogiized in that society it would be completely aimless behaviour. (2) The use of the word " concept " in this connection suggests, what is true, that linguistic behanour enters into the more refined forms of social actinty. You cannot play bridge without understanding and being able to use werds such as " revoke " and " trump "; you cannot pay bills urithout understanding the use of arith- metical syrnbols; you cannot make future arrangements and reminisce without understanding the use of the future and past tenses of verbs; you cannot be a Christian without understandirlg the use of such words as " God ", " sin ", " salvation" and so one might go on. This is what I mean when I say that bills are paid in terms of arithmetical concepts, that religious worship is carried on in terms of the concept of God, and so on. Liquidity preference is a technical concept of economics; it is not a con- cept generally used, for exanqple, by business men in their conduct of economic affairs. The economist uses it to explain how business men's behaviour in relation to money brings about changes in the value of money which they had not envisaged in behaving in that way. But the concept of liquidity preference is logically tied to concepts which are understood by business men in that its use by the economist presupposes his understanding of what it is to conduct a business, and in that this involves understanding such business concepts as money, profits, cost and risk. Again, a psychoanalyst may explain a patient's neurotic behaviour in terms of factors unknown to the patient and in terrns of concepts which would not be intelligible to him. The explanation may refer to events in the patient's early childhood; the description of those events will presuppose an under- standing of the concepts in tetms of which family life, for example, is carried on in our society and in terms of which the patient as an infant viewed, however rudimentarily, the members of his family. The concept of a father is different in our society from the corresponding concept amongst the Trobriand Islanders, and this difference would have to be understood by anyone who unshed to give an account of the differences in the respective aetiologies of the neuroses here and there. The difficulties involved in rejecting this view of the social scientist's relation to his subject-matter are well illustrated by Pareto's theory in The Mind and Socicty. According to Pareto, human behaviour can be classified into (I) Logical Conduct, which is conduct directed towards the achievement</page><page sequence="3">20 SOCIAL SCIENCE of a definite purpose, and making use of means the efficacy of which has been established by " logico-experimental reasoning " (i.e. roughly, the methods of natural science); and (2) Non-Logical Conduct, comprising all behaviour svhich in one way or another does not measure up to the specifications of Logical Conduct. Pareto's methodological recommendations for the study of social life are based on a distinction between what he calls " residues " and " derivations ". Residues are forms of activity which can be seen to occur fairly constantly in human societies at the most diverse places and times. Denvations on the other hand are unstable; they constitute a sort of theo- retical window-dressing for residues, purporting to explain why the actions in question are performed, but in fact being a mainly invalid rationalization concocted to provide a pseudo-justification for activities which are not really performed for any reason at all but which are the result of certain fundamental " sentiments " of which men are largely unconscious. 1 Pareto maintains that derivations are relatively unimportant and can safely be ignored by the social scientist who wishes to understand the residues. He says indeed that serious concern with derivations is more likely than not to stand in the way of any scientific understanding of social behaviour, since one of their distinguishing features is that they represent themselves as some- thing which they are not, and will tend to divert the sociologist's attention from the real nature and causes of the behaviour which he is studying. He cites religious practices as one important example of the kind of thing he has in mind; here ritual acts constitute the residues, and theological doctrines the corresponding derivations provide pseudo-justifications for their per- formance. But in terms of exactly what concepts are the residues which are being studied to be described and thought of ? The concepts applied to them in the society in which they are performed should be barred to the sociologist since these presuppose the validity of the derivations. Pareto often talks as if he holds a sort of Hobbesian atlew. In Sections I2C) and those immediately following of The Mind and SocieGy he tries to take ourer the terminology of mechanics for the description of social events, using expres- sions such as " force ", " equilibrium ", " tie 2', " real and virtual movement "; and although he warns occasionally that these terms do not necessarily carry quite the same sense as they do in ulechanics, he does not give any precise account of the ways in which they are supposed to differ. It is apparent that throughout the book he is hankering after a purely physical description of social actions. When he is discussing actual cases, however, he does not even begin to carry out this programme. The actions described are, for example, " sacrifices to the gods", or " self-sacrifice for one's country". But it is sufficiently obvious that these modes of clescription of the actions in question get their sense entirely from the systems of concepts in terms of which they 1 The above account at least represents one important strand in Pareto's thought. It must be said, however, that Pareto's account of the functioning of sentiments in social life is more than usually obscure and ambiguous, and it would be possible to extract from The Alind and Society a quite different theory. Cf., in particular, Section I696, which suggests that sentiments are logical constructions out of residues.</page><page sequence="4">P E T E R W I N C H  2I are performed, i.e. from what Pareto calls their " deristations". Clearly, too, no account of actions, as opposed to mere physical movements, could be given except in terms such as these; and no attempt to describe actions in physical, or even biological, terms could result in anything remotely resembling a description of a human society. Curiously enough, the defects in Pareto's conceptual apparatus seem to result pretty directly from his failure to see all the implications of the fact that science is itself a form of social activity. Despite the heavy irony which he is constantly directing against worshippers of " the Goddess Science ", he treats the criteria of scientific thinking as if they were something absolute and in a completely special position vis-d-vis the concepts used in other forms of social activity. But the " logico-experimental" criteria used in scientific thinking do not stand on their own feet; they cannot be understood except as involved in science as a form of human activity. In fact the relation between the concepts and theories of science on the one hand and the actierities of scientisttheir experimentation, etc. on the other hand is in this respect exactly parallel to that between Pareto's examples of derivations and residues. Scientific concepts are evolved by scientists in the course of their investigations and can only be understood in the context of those investigations. The investigations of scientists on the other hand can only be understood in terms of the concepts of science. Those concepts are, as it were, tailor-made to fit into the pattern of " logico-experimental reasoning". It is logically absurd to expect the concepts involrred in activities of quite a different type to fit into that pattern. These concepts iIl their turn can only be grasped in terms cf the activities in the context of which they are applied, and those activities similarly can only be understood in terms of the concepts appropriate to them. There is a related confusion in the whole idea of " logical action " as used by Pareto. It is an idea which really makes sense only within the framework of logico-experimental ideas. That is to say, within this frame- work we can speak of one action being logical, another illogical it is symp- tomatic that Pareto observes no clear and consistent distinction between " non-logical " and " illogical ", although this distinction is vital for his whole thesis. For him any action wllich is not logical is non-logical, and this term is applied to a very heterogeneous collection of activities. It is a confusion to say, as Pareto does, that scientific activity as such is a species of logical conduct. It is just as non-logical as is the practice of religion, though neither is illogical; and illogical actions can occur within the framework of both science and religion. To grasp this point is to go a long way towards under- standing the relation between concepts and behaviour in social life. II. WAYS OF DOING THINGS, HABITS AND RULES A series of articles by Professor Michael Oakeshott in The Cambridge Journal 1 does much to bring out the connection between the idea of reasonable 1 See in particular " The Tower of Babel ", Nov. I948, and " Rational Conduct ", OCt. I950.</page><page sequence="5">22 SOCIAL SCIENCE conduct and modes of social life. But Oakeshott obscures the nature of the latter by drawing an oversharp distinction between conduct which is a self- conscious application of verbally formulated lules and conduct which he calls tt habitual"* He argues, rightly, that there are fundamental confusions in what he calls the " rationalistic &gt;' conception of rationality, according to which standards of reasonable behaviour exist absolutely and are brought in, as it were, from the outside to regulate our conduct. But in his reaction from this brand of rationalism he stresses too mllch the notion of habit, and both misconceives and underestimates the importance for this subject of rxle- following in human affairs. To say that somebody's behaviour is governed by rules is not necessanly, as Oakeshott often seems to imply, to say that it exempliSes a self-conscious application of explicitly formulated pciples. A man's observance of rules may show itself itl his behaviour without requinng, for its recognition by othersy any verbal acknowledgement or formulation by him By { habitual behaviour" Oakeshott seems to mean behaviour which has not been taught- by precept but which has been acqulred in the course of practice. Examples he gives are cooking, speaking a language, behaving morally, taking part in scientific enquiry. He is quite nght in saying that sllch actinties as these are based very largely on the unreflective acquisition of skills in practice; but he does not seem to have noticed that conduct which is habitual in this sense is nevertheless often correctly descnbed as an instance of rule-followmg It is not on the same level as the conditioned reflex, nor even as what I will call " blind habit ". An example of the latter would be the llabit someone might acquire of always putting on his left shoe before his right. The distinction between blind habit and rule-governed habit is not a sharp one. The habit of always putting on the left shoe before the right may start as a blind habit and develop by imperceptible stages into the observance of a mle, or uice versa. Recognition of such a change in the character of a person's behaviour does not depend on any explicit avowal by him that he is malsing it a rule to act in this way; it ls sufficient if, for instanceJ he becomes annoyed with himself or performs a propitiatory rite if on some occasion he should put on his shoes the other way round. In short, he must show that he recopzes harring done somethlng wro?sg. In this trinal example the distinction is no doubt not very important; but it becomes very much so in connection mth such fundamental human activities as Oakeshott mentions as examples of what he calls " habitual behanour". A dog can be taught tricks (e.g. to balance a lump of sugar on its nose), and we can use words like " correct " and (' incoITect " in our assessments of his performance of the trick. This, however, is an anthropomorphic way of speaking, unobjectionable in its context but misleadmg if appealed to in support of any strong analogy between human and animal behanour. The very idea of performing a tnck, and the standards of correct behasriour which go along with that, cannot be fully elucidated simply by a descnption, how- ever detailed) of what dogs can be observed to do, but require a reference to</page><page sequence="6">PETER WINCH 23 charactenstic human forms of activity, to norms taken from a context of human social life and applied analogically to animal life. The dog, we can say, acquires a habit of doing certain things on certain occasions balancing the sugar when a word of cornmand is uttered; the behaviourist's causal terminology of " stimulus and response" descnbes the situation fairly ade- quately. If on some occasion the dog does not respond in the way we regard as appropnate, we may look for an explanatory cause perhaps a sttmulus operating in the contrary direction. We cannot say that the dog has done anything wrong, unless we look on his behaviour from the point of view of our own purposes and critena in teaching him the trick. Such expressions as this, however, are indispensable for the description of a rery large area of human behaviour; that, namely, which exemplifies rule-following rather than blirld habit. The dog's behaviour is stereotyped in that his habit consists in his always doing the same thing in response to the same stimulus. Now although to say of a man that he is following a rule in what he does also entails sapng of him that he always acts in the same way in a particular sort of situation, nevertheless the word " same " cames here a sense which differs importantly from that which it calTied in its previous use. In particular, it does not mean that the man's behaviour is stereotyped as is the dog's. For instance, somebody says that he makes it a rule always to be in good time for his appointments. This entails a lrery definite regularity in what he does on that kind of occasion. But the speci- fication of what constitutes the same kitd of occasion is very much more elastic than it is in the case where we are dealing with animal habits. He will leave himself plenty of time no luatter whom he is meeting and no matter whereJ and there may be borderline cases in whtch he has to decide whether the situation he is in constitutes having an appoirltment to keep or not. It must be possible to ask whether he is behaving consistently, and if, on some occasion) he fails to try to be in good time for an appointment he cannot rebut a charge of inconsistency simply by saying that it is after all a different person he is meeting on this occasion and in a different place} from what has been the case on previous occasions. One cannot charge a dog with inconsistency because a dog's behaviour does not exhibit the features in connection with which alone such a charge =makes sense. It must be possible in principle to make someone realxze that he has behaved inconsistently if it is to make sense to charge him with inconsistency, and this is possible only with someone who is himself capable of applying criteria for distinguishing similar from different situations in the regulation of his conduct. Animals cannot do this though we may apply our own criteria of sameness in describing what they do. The application of such criteria in the regulation of behaviour occurs characteristicallr where that behaviour exhibits regularity of a stery complex sort, extending olrer situations which in many respects differ markedly the one from the other. A bliIld habit on the other hand is a tendency to perform a fairly stereotyped action on a fairly stereotyped sort of occasiont where the charactenstics of the action or situation can be definitely speciSed in concrete</page><page sequence="7">4 SOCIAL SCIENCE terms. A person whose behaviour is rule-governed will, when laced with a situation markedly different from any he has previously had to deal with) have to decide how he is to interpret his rule in this new situation; but some- body who is merely acting Irom blind habit will be faced with no such problemn He may be at a loss what to do, but his problern will not take the same form as that of the person who is following a rule; in particular, no question of consistency can arise here. It is noteworthy that Oakeshott's approach leads him to say that dilemmas of the form " What ought I to do here ? ", in situations such as I am now envisaging, are likely to arise only for somebody who is self-consciously trying to follow explicitly formulated rulesJ not for somebody whose behaviour exhibits the kind of implicit rule-following of which I have been speaking, that is, whose conduct is what Oakeshott calls " habitual ". Now it may be true that the necessity for such heart-searchings is likely to be more frequent, and perhaps more pressing, for a person who is trying to follow an explicit rule without a foundation of esTeryday experi- ence in its application; but still questions of interpretation and consistency are bound to arise for anybody whose conduct is rule-goverrsed in the way I have described, i.e. for all of us, in dealing with a situation foreign to his previous experience. In a rapidly changirlg social environment such problems will arise frequently, not just as a result of the breakdown of traditional customary modes of behaviour, but as a result of the novelty of the situations in which that behaviour has to be carried on. To make this distinction is not to deny that a rapidly changing environment may lead to a breakdown in traditions of behaviour. It is possible to argue that in some spheres the position is the opposite of what Oakeshott's rriew would lead one to expect. A rule is open and makes possible the reflective application of past experi- eilce to new kinds of situation; a blind habit is confined to one particular nar4 ow type of situation and is likely to engender nothing but bewildersent where the conditions in which a person has to act are very novel. FurtherJ it hab been pointed out 1 that in the United States the existence of a verbally formulated Constitution sometimes makes for greater flexibility in the adminis- tration cvf the law than is possible in a country where there is no abstract principle to be appealed to above that embodied in the decisions of precedent cases. WThere a series of precedents leads to an inability to cope adequately with a novel social situation, the Suprerne Court, by appealing back to the original terms of the Constitution, has sometimes been able to break the deadlock. Not all the behaviour which is studied in the social sciences can be brought directly under the concept of rul-following. It is said, for instance, tnat Japanese men are attracted by the backs of woInen's necks rather than by their faces. Such facts as these abound in works of sociolegy and social anthropologSr, and they can be established by simple observation subject to controls very similar to those found in the natural sciences. Again, a political 1 By E. H. Levi in An Introduction to Legal Reasoning (published bU,&gt; the Law School of the University o f Chicago) .</page><page sequence="8">PETER WINCH 25 scientist might establish that the voting behaviour of a certain section of the electorate was completely random and subject to no rule at all. That would be established in the same sort of way and might perhaps be formulated statistically. In itself it would not require any understanding by the investi- gator of rules followed by the objects of his investigation. To such activities of the social scientist as these the considerations put forward in this paper have no direct relevance. My argument is, however, that the conception of a human society in general cannot be grasped except in terms of the concept of rule-following and that rule-governed behaviour constitutes one of the most interesting fields for investigation by the social sciences. Moreover, even in cases such as those just mentioned one is never very far away from rule-governed behaviour. Even if a man's actual voting behaviour is random, to grasp what he is doing as an instance of voting is impossible unless one has some understanding of the organization of political affairs in his society. Even if he casts his vote in a random way, his behaviour is not completely random and arbitrary if what he is doing is voting. He is participating in a form of social life and his behaviour is guided, y)erhaps unreflectively, by considera- tions of what is and what is not appropriate in that form of activity. The political scientist can be assumed to be familiar with those considerations and most of the time he has no need to bring them into the open. But the results of his scientiSc and statistical methods of investigation are relevant and im- portant only in virtue of his and his readers' understanding of the way of life in the context of which they are applied. Otherwise one has merely a rag-bag of facts without significance or cohesion. III. SCIENTIFIC THEORIZING AND UNDERSTANDING A WAY OF LIFE In the light of the above considerations I want now to ask in what sense the behaviour of men in society may be said to exhibit regularities such as may be studied by the social scientist and made the basis of scientific theories. Mill's view, in Book VI of the System of Logic, is that these regularities are on precisely the same logical footing as those which may be observed in the realm of nature, the difference being one of complexity only, and this view is still tacitly assumed in many contemporary pronouncements on the nature and methods of social science. I wish to argue, on the contrary, that the whole sense of the word " regularity " is different in this context, and that con- sequently the investigation of society is on quite a different logical footing from the investigation of nature. To say that there are regularities to be observed in a certain realm of events is to say that in specifiable circumstances the same specifiable event always, or nearly always, happens. Obviously, this presupposes that we have criteria of sameness; we must have some method of deciding when an occur- rence in one situation counts as the same qualitatively as an occurrence in another situation. So the appropriate method of determining the type of regularity with which we have to deal in a given field will be to investigate</page><page sequence="9">26 SOCIAL SCIENCE the kind of criteria according to which we decide in that field when the same thing has happened in more than one situation. When we are dealing with a physical science these criteria must be looked for in the context of the methods and procedures of investigators working in that science, for the application of those criteria is unintelligible in abstraction from those pro- cedures. Consider an investigation like Galileo's into the mechanics of falling bodies, involving experiments with balls on inclined planes, and suppose that the investigator performs two experiments with two differently inclined planes. He will say that the conditions of these two experiments are different in that the planes are differently inclined; he has of course methods for determining when two planes are diflerently inclined, and what " differently snclined" means cannot be understood by someone who does not understand at least something of those methods. The fact that the two planes are made from the same sort of wood is not taken into account here; neither is the colour of the wood, nor the name of the carpenter who constructed the planes. Why these factors are not taken into consideration can be understood only on the basis of knowing something about the nature of the investigation which the physicist is corlducting. For somebody else, conducting a different sort of investigation, e.g. into the durability of different types of wood, the adequacy of a given carpenter's xvork, the aesthetic effects of differently coloured struc- tures, these factors wollld of course be relevant. That is to say, he would decide whether two situations were the " same" or not according to different criteria from those used by the physicist conducting the kind of investigation now under discussion. One's criteria for (leciding when two situations are to be regarded as being of the same kind are relative tc the kind of activity in the context of which the question arises. I wish to consider this relation more closely, in connection with the form of social actilrity we call stientific investigation. A scientist's methods of investigation exemplify conduct carrsed out according to rules. It must always make sense to ask whether he has carried out his procedures correctly or incorrectly, and this is only possible where there exist standards of correctness which can be applied to them. Standards of correct- ness presuppose the possibility of one person's mistake being corrected by other persons, a possibility involving interaction between people in a social context. It is in fact a constitutive part of the notion of scientific investiga- tionX as of any other social activity, that its practice by any one person shall be in principle subject to check and correction by other persons; for where this possibility does not exist, there is no possibility of doing something wrong, therefore no possibility of doing anything nght either.l Tn charactenzing the relation between an individual scientist and his {ellow-participants in the traditzon of activity which makes his actions on a given occasion an example of scientific inquiry, one cannot be content with a set of precepts or rules ol be}waviour the following of which constitutes t Cf. Wittgenstein, Philosophical IetUestt;ations, I, 2f6 ff.; also Rush Rhees: " Can there be a Private Language ? ", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volume XXVIII.</page><page sequence="10">PETER WINCH 27 engaging in scientific inquiry. For what is in question is: what is it precisely about the behanour of scientists which makes us say of them that they are following these precepts, assuming that the latter could be satisfactorily formulated ? Oakeshott, in his article on " Rational Conduct ", notes that such an activity goes beyond anything that could be formulated in a set of precepts, at least in respect of the fact that those pr2cepts have to be applied in practice by scientists. One could add that any attempt to formulate the way the rules are applied in terms of another higher-order set of rules wollld start one off on the slope of an infinite regress precisely parallel to that pointed out by Lewis Carroll in " What the Tortoise said to Achilles". The point here is that the notion of following a rule is presupposed by the specification of any particular set of rules; such a specification says nothing at all about the kind of behaviour in the context of which alone the idea of following a rule makes sense. This notion could not be understood by someone who was not already familiar with that sort of behaviour. In Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations we have a characterization of the sort required.l I will here quote from Section I43 in extenso. Let us . . . examine the following kind of language-game: When A gives an order B has to write down series of signs according to a certain formation-rule. The first of these series is meant to be that of the natural numbers in decimal notation.-How does he get to understand this notation ? First of all series of numbers will be tten dolvn for him and he will be required to copy them.... And here already there is a normal, and an abnollllal hearer's reaction. At first perhaps we guide his hand in writing out the series o to g; but then the possibility Of getting him to understand will depend on his going on to te it down independ- ently.-And here we can imagiIle, e.g. that he does copy the figures independently, but not in the right order: he writes sometimes one sometimes another at random. And then communication stops at that point.-OI agaln he makes " mistakes " in the order.-The difference between this and the first case will of course be one of frequency. - Or he makes a systematic mistake; for example he copies every other number, or he copies the series o, I, 2, ^, 4, 5} ................................... hke this: I, O, 3, 2, 5, 4, Here we shall almost be tempted to say he has understood wrong. Notice, however, that there is no sharp distinction between a random riistake and a systematic one. That is, between what you are inclined to call " random " and what " systematic". I said that Wittgenstein characterized some general features of conduct which is subject to rules. In fact, however, as he himself points out in the next section, what he has done here is to describe what might happen in the situation envlsaged but in fact does not commonly happen, the purpose of this procedure being as follows: I wanted to put that picture before him (sc. the person to whom Wittgenstein has imagined himself to be speakiIlg), and his acceptance of the picture consists in his now being inclined to regard a given case differently: that is, to compare it with this rather than that set of pictures. I have changed his way of looking at things. One might express the way of looking at things induced by Wittgenstein's remarks by saying: one is now inclined to notice and even to feel slightly 1 Cf. especially I, I43 ., and I, I85 ff.</page><page sequence="11">28 SOCIAL SCIENCE surprised about a fact that is so obvious that one would normally overlook it altogether; the fact, namely, that when somebody is taught to do something he will normally go on independently in the activity which he has been taught in the same way as the teacher himself would go on. One sees further that unless the behaviour of most people agreed in this sort of way the notion of rule-guided behaviour would be completely inapplicable. The " normal " reaction, in the sense of the reaction which most people will in fact exhibit, is elevated into a standard of correct behaviour from the point of view of the particular rule in question, and any behaviour which deviates from it will be said to constitute a mistake. I am not saying that people observe that most of them act in the same way in certain situations and then agree to take that common way of behaving as their norm for deciding what actions are right and what wrong. This may of course happen in individual cases: for instance, suppose that in the early days of motor transport no particular rule was observed concerning the cosTect side of the road to drive along; suppose further that with the increase in traffic it became necessary to institute some such rule; in deciding what rule to institute it might be observed that people already had a natural tendency to drive on the left-hand side rather than the right; and then it might be decided that that mode of behaviour should in future count as the norme But the " agreement " to which I am refetTing here is more primitive than that, and a very large measure of it would already be presupposed in the situation just described. For no sense can be given to such notions as noticing that so and so is the case unless men already have a mode of comrnunication a language of some sort in the use of which rules are already being ob- served. For one cannot notice anything without being able to identify definite characteristics; which means that one must have some concept of definite characteristics; and that involves the rule-governed use of some symbol to refer to those characteristics.l The development of rules rests on a primitive, urlselfconscious consensus of reactions. One cannot say that this consensus of reactions comes first and is followed by the observance of rules; for the relation between the notion of a rule and the notion of a consensus of reactions of this tvpe is a logical one, not a relation of cause and effect. The kind of conDensus which is here in question is describable only in terms of the notion of a rule; and the notion of a rule is indescrlbable apart from the concept Of that sert of consensus. Further) I am not saying that it must always be right to do what the majority of people do, and that deviation must, from a sort of logical necessity, be wrong. One mllst reInember that a deviation from commonly accepted standards, however radical it may be, is never a complete rejection of all cornmonly accepted standards. However xriolent a disagreement may be, it cannot but occur against a vast bacliground of common presumptions. With- out such a background the very notion of a disagreement would be impossible. A particular scierltist, for example, may disagree profoundly with all his 1 Cf. Rush Rhees, " Can there be a Private l,anguage 2 '; passim.</page><page sequence="12">PETER WINCH 29 colleagues concerning some important point of doctrine or method, as Einstein disagreed with his fellow physicists over quantum mechanics. But if Einstein had not shared a vast area of common ground, in the shape of a scientific tradition comprising both theory and techniques of investigation, he could not even have begun to formulate not even to himself- those points over which he disagreed with his colleagues. That is tantamount to saying that it would make no sense in such circumstances to speak of a disagreement between him and them. A disagreement must be abo?wt something, and where it is in principle impossible to formulate the points of disagreement, the idea of there being a disagreement is logically absurd. In the language-game described in Section I43 of the Philosophical Investi- gations no question arises of what following the rule involves in circumstances different from those in connection with which it was taught. One might say that the behaviour of somebody who has satisfactonly learnt this rule is stereotyped like the dog's performance of a trick. Of course it differs from the latter in that a person following a rule must himself understand when the rule has been correctly, and when incorrectly, followed, if he is to be said to have grasped the rule rather than merely to have acquired a blind habit; whereas the dog can hardly be intelligibly said to understand this, although we may say of the dog that he has acted correctly or incorrectly.l A parrot might, nevertheless, be trained to repeat the numerals from o to 9 in their correct order as well as a man. But the rules which are most important in human life are used to guide people's actions in circumstances rnarkedly different from those in connection with which they were first learnt or acquired; and therein precisely lies much of their importance. To illustrate what " different circumstances" means here I will again quote from Wittgenstein this time Section I85 of the Philosophical Investigations. Now - judged by the usual c:riteria-the pupil has mastered the series of natural numbers. Next we teach him to write down other series of cardinal numbers and get him to the point of writing down series of the form, o, n, 2n, 3n, etc. at an order of the forrn " + n "; so at the order " + T " he writes down the series of natural numbers. Let us suppose we have done exercises and given him tests up to TOOO. Now we get the pupil to continue a senes (say + 2) beyond IOOO and he writes IOOO, I004, I008, TOI2. We say to him: " Look, what you've done." He doesn't understand. We say: " You were meant to add two: look how you began the series." He answers: " Yes, isn't it right ? I thought that was how I was meant to do it." Or suppose he pointed to the senes and said: " But I went on in the sare.e way."-It would now be no use to say: " But can't you see . . . ? " and repeat the old examples and explanations. In such a case we might say, perhaps; " It comes natural to this person to understand our order with our explanations as we should understand the order: ' Add 2 Up to IOOO, 4 up to 2000, 6 up to 3000 and so on.'" In this example following a rule involves performing actions different from those onginally demonstrated in the teaching of the rule; and the 1 See Section II above. C</page><page sequence="13">3o SOCIAL SCIENCE criterion for deciding whether somebody has understood the rule is precisely that he should be able to go on in this way. What he has to do is in one sense different from what he originally did under supervision, but nevertheless counts, in relation to that rgle, as going on in the same way. Again, as in the first example, the possibility of the existence of the rule depends on agreement amongst the majority of people concerning what particular actions shall cognt as the same. Neither criteria of sameness nor, what is fundamentally the same thing, rules could exist if the behaviour of everybody were eccentric like the man's in Wittgenstein's example, and according to no fairly simple pattern. The above considerations relate to the notion of a rule as such, not simply to mathematical rules or to any particular kind of rule. Of course, many important human activities are characterized by rules which differ markedly from those governing the pursuit of mathematics. For instance, in morality politics, the law and aesthetics there is much disagreement about what, in concrete terms, gottg or tn the same way demands} and very many of the most important disputes within those fields can be regarded as attempts to resolve such disagreements and to find commonly acceptable interpretations of whatever rule is in question. I will return to this aspect of the matter before concluding; but at present I wish to concentrate on the fact of agree- ment over large areas rather than on the fact of disagreement over other large areas, and to insist once again that the latter could not exist without the former. People could not disagree about anything at all unless they also agreed about a great deal: if about nothing else, at least about the application of the rules governing the use of the language in which they talk about their disagreements. This discussion of the nature of rule-governed behaviour arose out of an attempt to understand the nature of the criteria according to mrhich we judge, in a natural science, when there are regularities in the phenomena which are the subject-matter of that science. This was necessary because the notion of applying criteria makes sense only in the context of rule-governed behaviour and cannot be understood without some understanding of what is involved in the latter. I have tried to show that the detection and study of physical regularities rests on the existence of regularities of a different sort in human behaviour. Now according to the Mill tradition the idea of a social science is the idea of a body of theory based on the detection and formulation al regularities in human behaviour in society: that is, according to the present analysis, regularities of the sort involved in rule-governed beharriour. The question now to be considered then is this: taking into aceouIlt the peculiari- ties of this kind of regularity, can its detection and formulation rest on the same kind of procedure as does the detection and formulation of physical regularities ? The criteria by which a phvsicist judges that a regularity exists in a certain field of phenomena have been evolved in the practice of scientific investigation. The individual scientist stands in relation both to the phe-</page><page sequence="14">PETER WINCH 3I nomena which he is studying and also to his fellow scientists. Both these relations are essential for it to make sense to say of him that he is detecting regularities. But they are relations of a very different sort. The phenomena present themselves to the scientist as an object of study; his fellow scientists, on the other hand, are related to him as fellow participants in the activity of study; without this relation the word " study" could not intelligibly be applied to the actions he is performing. The concepts used by the scientist are formulated and modified according to the way the phenomena are observed to behave. But the role of the scientist's fellow workers is different from this; he does not evolve his concepts on the basis of his observation of the way they behave, but rather he is able to evolve them in virtue of the fact that he is doing the same kind of thing as they are, namely investigating in a certain way. The very concept of observation in the sense in which it is relevant as a description of part of the scientist's activities, is possible only in virtue of this relation between him and his fellow workers, so that this relation clearly cannot be that between observer and observed. To maintain that it is the same is to tie oneself up in a logical circle. This relation is necessary if the scientist is to understand the concepts employed in scientiSc research. One of the chief tasks of.the social scientist who wishes to understand a particular form of human activity in a given society will be, as I argued earlier, to understand the concepts involved in that activity. It would appear then that he cannot acquire such an under- standing by standing in the same relation to the participants in that form of activity as does the natural scientist to the phenomena which he is studying. His relation to them must rather be that between the natural scientist and his fellow natural scientists; i.e. that of a fellow participant. It is of course possible to observe regularities in human behaviour and to express them in the form of generalizations. But my point is that it is not possible to under- stand the principles according to which such behaviour is carried on purely by this method. For understanding those principles involves understandlng the concepts involved in that behaviour, and these are mastered not by observing and theorizing, but by actually taking part in that activity together urith the other people involved in it. This point is reinforced by such common-sense considerations as the following. A historian of religion must himself have some religious feeling if he is to " get inside " the religious movement which he is studying; a historian of art must have some aesthetic sense and some understanding of the kind of problem which confronts artists; a history of philosophy is best written by a philosopher; and so on. The argument of this paper also provides some justification for the pro- found historical scepticism and relativism of an Idealist philosopher of history such as Collingwood. Its practical implications become pressing when the social scientific investigator is dealing with behaviour in a society which is very remote from the ways of doing things with which membership of his own society has made him familiar. He cannot participate in that kind of</page><page sequence="15">32 SOCIAL SCIENCE behaviour since it is no longer carried on; all he can do is to look at those activities for which he has historical evidence from the outside. This accounts for the weight attached to concepts like " empathy " and " historical imagina- tion" by the Idealists. However much metaphysical confusion their use of those concepts carried with it, they did at least emphasize in a salutary fashion how different are the criteria by which we judge the value of an historical account from those by which we judge the value of a scientific theory. In conclusion I wish to make some remarks about the logical basis for predictions of social events and about the application of deterministic ideas to the realm of human society. To understand what is going on in a particular area of a given society one must understand the rules according to which the various activities being performed there are carried on. If one knows the rule which somebody is following one can, in a large number of cases, predict what he will do on a giveri occasion. For instance, if one knows that a man is following the rule: " Start with o and add 2 till you reach IOOO", one can predict that, having written down " I04 ", he will next write down " I06 ". Thus far, the position might appear to be closely analogous to the use of one's knowledge of a natural law in order to predict a future physical event-say an eclipse of the sun. But sometimes and this is the sort of case which is important in the development of a human society even if one knows with certainty the rule which a man is following, one canno! predict with any confidence what he will do on a given occasion. This occurs when the occasion in question involves circumstances markedly different from any to which the rule has hitherto been applied, for here the question may very well arise: what is involved in following the rule in circumstances like these ? There may then be deliberation, argument, the canvassing of rival interpretations, followed perhaps by the adoption of some agreed compromise interpretation or by the coming into existence of nval schools. Processes like this can be seen in the development of any historical tradition: consider for example the development of the notion of empiricism in philosophy, of the notion of realism in literature; consider the relation between the music of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms; or in politics consider the rival schools of political thought which all claim, with some show of reason, to be based on the Marxist tradition. The process is seen in a conveniently simplified form in legal procedures, the cantrassing of rival interpretations of a rule of law by opposing counsel, followed by a judicial decision on what the rule is to be taken to mean in circumstances like this. The important point to notice is that in all cases where a rzle is applied in cases like this something in the nature of a decision is bound to take place, even where the clear-cut decision procedure of the law-courts does not exist: bound as a matter of logical necessity, since the conditions of the situation in question include the proposition that it has not yet been settled what the rule is to imply in these circumstances. A shrewd obserxrer may have a hunch which way the decision will go, but the rule as thus far developed does not entail one decision rather than another. Consider the difference between the</page><page sequence="16">PETER WINCH 33 predictions of a shrewd lawyer on the outcome of a trial, or of a shrewd chan- cellor of the exchequer on the outcome of a particular economic policy, on the one hand, and on the other hand the predictions of an engineer on what will happen to the behaxiour of a particular piece of machinery if a certain modification is made to it. Both the engineer and the chancellor or lawyer may be either right or wrong of course; but the latter may be right or wrong for reasons which it would be nonsensical to apply to the success or failure of the engineer's predictions. A human society cannot be adequately described without use being made of the notion of a developing tradxtion. This notion is inapplicable to the behaviour of objects such as are studied by the natural sciences-either of inanimate objects or of non-human animals; here the behaviour being studied does not exemplify the application of rules. The behaviour of the natural scientific investigator does of course exemplify this, and the scientific laws which he formulates do dexelop in accordance with the scientific tradition of which they form a part. But the investigation of the scientist's behaviour and of the development of a scientific tradition, belongs to the social, not the natural, sciences.
