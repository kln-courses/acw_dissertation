D. Adrian, F.R.S., whose address was reported in last week's Journal (p. 587). There were, as usual, a number of contributions which directly or otherwise were related to medicine. Control of Cell Division A new approach to the control of cell division in living organisms was described in the Section of Zoology by"Pro fessor M. M. Swann (Edinburgh University), the factors con cerned in the general problem being taken to include the availability of energy, the stage of growth of the cell, effects loosely described as " contact " with other cells, differentia tion, and carcinogens. He had selected the energy factor as the one best suited to an initial investigation by simple experiments. The eggs of sea urchins were exposed to carbon monoxide (as a means of temporarily shutting off energy) during different periods of time, and a delay in division resulted which was equal to the duration of exposure. Divi sion, if already begun, was completed, and the next division was then delayed by the same amount. It seemed probable that the energy-storing substance was a complex phosphate ; and the equality between exposure time and delay (in which ever division) suggested that the substance concerned served no other function in cellular metabolism. A search for such a phosphate, of which the quantity present varied according to whether cell division was approaching or had lately been initiated, was carried out recently at the Millport Station of the Scottish Marine Biological Association, using paper chromatographic separation, but the results were not avail able in time for the meeting. Obesity A discussion on obesity was held by the Section of Physio logy. Dr. J. M. Tanner (St. Thomas's Hospital Medical School) argued that it was necessary to distinguish not merely between " overweight " and " overfat " but also between the overall quantity of fat in an individual and fat content per fat cell. He suggested the term lipo plethory, following Lawrence,1 to designate the relative fullness of cells with fat. The view could then be taken that a person of any build might become, a priori, lipo plethoric, but that only those relatively high in endomorphy (Sheldon) could produce a sufficiently high percentage of body fat to be called obese. Serum cholesterol concentra tion, which was related but not very closely to body fat, might be more closely related to lipoplethory. Although the percentage of weight carried as fat was what mattered in therapeutic medicine, a guide to the number of fat cells possessed by an individual might well be valuable in preven tive medicine. In well-nourished countries, persons with many fat cells were the ones who needed to diet. Dr. A. P. Meiklejohn (Edinburgh University) pointed out that there was much more to be learnt about the reactions of the body to overfeeding and their relation, direct or indirect, to arterial degeneration. Pending the results of fundamental research, he commended a look at the patient or the weighing balance as the best guides. But he criticized the use in Great Britain of American tables which still seemed to be based on the average heights and weights of Americans seeking life assurance in 1885-90?though with recent theoretical adjustments (1942-3). He suggested that the British Association, which organized and carried out the first thorough anthropomorphic survey in Great Britain (published in 1883), might undertake a further survey, and that this could be usefully integrated with a study of the complications of obesity. Here was a fine field for research workers in gerontology, possibly assisted by the new College of General Practitioners, and advised by the Committee on Growth and Form of the Medical Research Council. Pro fessor Jean Mayer (Harvard University) described an experi ment in which a " waltzing " mouse was mated with a genetically obese mouse, the result being a waltzing obese mouse, which, however, put on only one-sixth of the weight of one that was merely obese. In another experiment, an obese mouse, given an hour's work a day on a treadmill, was found to halve his weight gain, whereas more work, resulting in greater appetite, led to an increase in weight. He concluded that, for weight reduction, one should take exercise, but not too much. Genetics and Medicine During an all-day session on genetics, held jointly by the Sections of Zoology and Botany, Professor L. S. Pen rose, F.R.S. (University College, London), questioned the soundness of eugenic arguments to the effect that, behind a fa?ade of improvement due to hygienic and nutritional conditions, the population was deteriorating physically and mentally because of the preservation of hereditary weak lings. Genes that were unfavourable in one context were often favourable in another ; for example, the sickle-cell gene protected its possessor from malaria, and control of malaria reduced its incidence. In other cases, disease re sulted from an exceptional concatenation of abnormal genes. It was thus unsound to try to get rid of particular genes, unless the harm done by them was known to outweigh the good, and genetic variety was, on general principles, an advantage. Knowledge of inherited biochemical constitu tion, based on genetics, would, however, help directly in the attack on disease, and knowledge of the genetics of pathogenic parasites was indirectly useful. The latter aspect was taken up by Dr. G. Pontecorvo and Dr. J. A. Roper (Glasgow University), who described the analysis of novel (parasexual) systems of recombination in micro-organisms, and discussed the significance of such findings for host pathogen relationships. " Healthy " Hallucinations In the Section of Psychology Mr. J. C. Raven (The Crichton Royal, Dumfries) quoted examples of hallucina tions which, unless rejected as carefully planned mis representations, made it impossible in his view to go on dismissing hallucinatory experiences as merely " morbid imaginations " or " distortions of fact." If recorded hallu cinations were arranged in order from those most obvi ously morbid to those most obviously healthy, charac teristic similarities and differences were found between them. Hallucinations, in general, arose during tension or when a personal problem required solution ; but, whereas in mental illness they tended to take the form of fixed, fragmented, or encapsuled ideas beyond the patient's control or under standing and often seemed detrimental, those experienced during times of well-being tended to be mobile and appro priate. They appeared to be intimately related to past and present events and to increase awareness of their signi ficance, and were also related to the conduct of other people. They expressed a sympathetic responsiveness, and the percipient was usually aware of the part that they played in apprehending and interpreting what was experienced. Only as recognition was given to the subjective nature of experience and to personality as something essentially ex perienced in human relationships was it likely that the context of hallucinations would be understood, or any satisfactory concept of mind be formed. Tropical Medicine Recent investigations of the natural history of loaiasis, a disease which results from infection with a filarial parasite (Loa loa) and causes much suffering among the indigenous and European populations in certain parts of Africa, were described by Professor R. M. Gordon and Dr. W. E. Ker shaw (Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine). The work had been based on the Kumba laboratory in the British Cameroons. Prior to the establishment of the laboratory, it was known that loaiasis was transmitted from man to man by certain biting flies of the genus Chrysops, and that these flies were most numerous in the cleared areas surrounding small villages situated in the tropical rain-forest. The flies British Medical Journal, 1951, 1, 373.</page><page sequence="2">642 Sept. 11, 1954 BRITISH ASSOCIATION ? British ' Medical Journal had now been found to extend far beyond the cleared areas, and by the use of observation platforms, built to a height of 80 to 120 ft. above the forest canopy, informa tion had been collected which suggested that loaiasis was not not confined to the human population but occurred also in the monkey population living in the forest, which thus formed a reservoir of infection.</page></plain_text>
