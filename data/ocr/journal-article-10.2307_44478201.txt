King Department of Anthropology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA Abstract The structure and meaning of Mixtee codical symbolism is examined, based on data drawn from language, ethnography, and ethnohistory. The article is divided into three parts: (a) a discussion of Mixtee ideology and myth, with respect to codex symbolism; (b) a description of Mixtee poetics and symbolic correlates; and (c) an interpretive commentary of a brief mythological passage from the Vienna codex as a practical illustration of the first two parts of the article. Traditionally, Mixtee codex analysis has focused on toponymie identification, genealogical reconstruction, and chronological correlation in an effort to elucidate the historical significance of the codices (Caso 1977; Smith 1973). But this represents only one portion of the information recorded in these manuscripts. By this I mean that our attention to history has encouraged us to neglect the rich symbolic dimension permeating every aspect of the codices. My research into the structure and logic of Mixtee ideology on the eve of Spanish contact (King 1988) has uncovered a num- ber of patterned correlations between Mixtee linguistic structure and the symbolic structure of Precolumbian Mixtee codices. In addition to providing an analytical means to interpret codical symbolism, these relationships have been instrumental in the discovery of a syllabic writing system. This system is used to communicate brief messages that descriptively support the his- torical events and individuals portrayed in the codices. These short captions are written and read using the pictographic signs for the ritual calendar and its related special terminology. With these interpretive breakthroughs, portions of codical text can be reconstructed, guided by the captions and the poetic correlates of contextually associated symbols. To illustrate these findings, I have analyzed a brief passage from the obverse of the Vienna codex. As this analysis reveals, the codices are literally filled with direct references and symbolic allusions to important Mixtee myths and the ideological rela- tions they embody. Strictly speaking, to understand the mean- ing of codical symbolism, one must first understand Mixtee religion and how religious concepts and symbols are used in the social, political, and economic support of the elite class. Even within the brief passage presented here, certain mythic themes and metaphors are of paramount importance to a comprehen- sion of meaning. While it is not reasonable to support a brief commentary with a lengthy model of Mixtee ideology, some explanation is essential; those seeking a more complete and detailed discussion on the structure and meaning of Mixtee ide- ology and symbolism are referred elsewhere (King 1982:35-109, 1988:134-417). Given these considerations, I have divided the article into three sections, beginning with a brief discussion of the ideological concepts represented in the scene being analyzed, followed by a description of poetics and captioning, and con- cluding with the commentary and interpretation of the scene's meaning. MYTH AND MIXTEC SYMBOLISM Surely, myths are one of the most precious resources for scho- lars of ancient Mesoamerica. Myths embody key conceptual structures within a sociocultural system, and provide a map of the logical relations that exist between concepts. In this sense, we see myth reflected in a variety of ways throughout Meso- america: in art and symbolism, architecture, poetry, and in the policies and actions of political regimes (e.g., Bricker 1981; Broda 1987; Burkhart 1989; Carrasco 1982, 1987; Conrad and Demarest 1984; Gossen 1974; Hunt 1977; Matos Moctezuma 1987). In a sense, Mixtee studies have suffered from a lack of myth. Mixtee colonial resources only preserve tantalizing portions of origin myths (Burgoa 1934; García 1981; Herrera 1947; Reyes 1976), and, until recently, Mixtee ethnography has yielded few myths (Dyk 1959; Ibach 1980). This is ironic because the Mix- tec genealogical codices are filled with pictorial accounts of mythic origins. Early Mixtee rulers are shown emerging from trees, rivers, and from the earth itself; often these individuals interact with spiritual entities (ñuhu), in a way that suggests pic- torially the kinds of human/god encounters described in the Il- iad of Homer. Not all myths are of equal importance to an understanding of ideology. For example, the Aztec myths which recount the origins of the world and its sacrificial maintenance are critical to an understanding of Aztec history (Carrasco 1982, 1987; Conrad and Demarest 1984). This is not surprising; every cul- ture has what may be termed "key symbols" (Ortner 1973), "root paradigms" (Turner 1974), or "ultimate sacred postulates" (Rappaport 1979). Such concepts lie at the heart of important myths and rituals, often supporting both the structure and logic of social, political, and economic relations (e.g. Sahlins 1972, 1981). The structure of Mixtee symbolism is similarly supported by two dominant mythological concepts: sacrifice and Rain. 141</page><page sequence="2">1 42 King The Covenant of Sacrifice In his recent ethnography, Monaghan (1987) showed how the concept of sacrifice plays a key role in the social organization in the Mixtee town of Nuyoo. He traces the concept to the myth of the great covenant with the Earth: In the beginning, when the world was newly revealed, the first people became hungry, whereupon they cleared fields and planted them with seed. But they did not realize their actions caused great pain and suffer- ing to the Earth; and the Earth undid their work during the night in response to this offense. The people returned the next morning only to find they again needed to clear fields for plant- ing, only to suffer the same consequences that night. Eventu- ally, the people asked the Earth why they were not being allowed to feed themselves, and the Earth told the people of its grievances. In compromise, a covenant was made whereby the people agreed they would go nowhere else but to the Earth when they died, giving their own bodies as food for the Earth in ex- change for the food they take from the body of the Earth. Thus, the related proverb states: "We eat the Earth, and the Earth eats us" (Monaghan 1987). In this myth, the spiritually stronger, superior Earth gives the gift of food to the people who, in return, will give lesser, sacrificial counter-gifts of food until such time as they die and satisfy their role in the Covenant. These token ritual sacrifices mostly take the form of liquor, candles, flowers, and food. The same logic also defines gift-exchange relations between house- holds. In this social corollary to the myth, a household that bears the economic burden of festival sponsorship gives a gift to the community, which is supported by the smaller counter- gifts of food brought by the households attending the festival, symbolically expressing their indebtedness to the sponsor. Over time, any single household develops a complex relationship with other households through the accumulated debts owed, and the outstanding debts to be repaid (Monaghan 1987). In this way the mythic significance of sacrifice is instrumental in processes of social integration. Rain The Mixtee conceive of the universe as divided into two com- plementary halves: the (feminine) Earth and the (masculine) Sky (Monaghan 1987). 1 Rain is a sexual metaphor for the periodic relations that occur between the spirits of the Earth and those of the Sky. But to understand the mythic importance of Rain (capitalized to distinguish the mythic concept from the meteo- rological phenomenon), we must go back to the origins of the universe. According to one colonial source, creation began in the primordial darkness, before time, when the world only con- sisted of mud and slime (Garcia 1981). At this stage of creation, the Earth and the Sky are united. The Vienna codex corroborates this myth; the codex itself re- lates a long origin myth, beginning with an array of sacred sym- bols that exists before time, and before there are places on the face of the earth (page 52a). On the sixth page of the Vienna codex (page 47b), the culture-hero, Lord 9-Wind, changes this state by literally lifting the waters of the Sky from the face of the Earth; this scene is followed by nine pages of place-glyphs *The basic distinction between Earth and Sky is also found among the Zapotee (Marcus 1989) and the Cuicatec (Hunt 1977) and may, in fact, be a Proto-Otomanguean ideological feature (Marcus et al. 1983). that have been revealed by Lord 9-Wind. This action also "un- covers" the first instance of Rain symbolism (i.e., face sym- bolism that is cognate with Tlaloc) in the Vienna codex, appearing beneath the feet of 9-Wind as he raises the Sky. This scene tells us that Rain is a mythological invocation of the pri- mal state of the universe. Logically speaking, Rain cannot ex- ist until the Sky is separated from the Earth. Thus, the action of 9-Wind transforms the universe from a state of timeless unity to one of periodic union; Rain is the expression of cosmologi- cal reunion (King 1988). Traditional curing practices reflect this mythic sense of Rain in the medicinal mixing of earth with pul- que or saliva (Mak 1959; Monaghan 1987), symbolically recreating a primordial substance. Rain, Sacrifice, and Mixtee Ideology The symbolic vocabulary employed in the codices is strictly or- ganized according to the concepts embedded within the myths of Rain and sacrifice. By this I mean that each symbol is de- fined in terms of its relationship to both myths. The mythic structure of Rain distinguishes symbolic elements with respect to the Earth, the Sky, or the Center. The Center is a metaphor for the 'household' or the 'bed' of Rain, where the Earth and Sky bring forth new life. In this sense, the concept of Rain rep- resents the basic cosmic structure of the Mixtee universe. In contrast, the mythic meaning of sacrifice represents the basic principle of social and economic relations. In this model, there is (a) the giver or source of gifts; (b) the ones who ac- knowledge gifts with sacrificial tokens; and (c) the gifts and offerings that are exchanged. Thus, every symbol is defined according to its place in the universe, and its social role or func- tion. The conceptual overlapping of the two mythic classifica- tions defines the logic of Mixtee ideology. Life is perpetuated by exchange. Sexual exchange produces life; its domain is the Center. Other forms of exchange sustain and perpetuate life. Covenants and sacrifice between man and spiritual beings per- tain to the realm of the Earth; exchange relations within the community pertain to the realm of the Sky. In this way the lay- ers of the natural universe - Earth, Center, and Sky - meta- phorically correspond to the layers of Mixtee society, that is, the individual, the household, and the community. Similarly, the sexual difference defining exchange at the Center metaphori- cally overlaps with the superior and inferior roles in sacrificial exchange (e.g., male = superior, King 1988:147-340).2 IDEOLOGY, SYMBOLISM, AND POETICS The Mixtee myths of sacrifice and Rain together represent the conceptual parameters of ideology, structuring the universe into three sacrificial contexts. The resulting paradigm also provides the analytical key to understanding symbolic meaning in the codices.3 However, the symbolism of the codices and the con- 2The merging of the mythic concepts of sacrifice and Rain is also seen in the ideological significance of community festivals, as described by Monaghan (1987). The simultaneous exchange of so many gifts and counter-sacrifices in the context of a festival is conceptualized in terms of 'communal Rain'. The sponsoring household functions as the channel through which the vitality of the Earth is brought to the community (Sky); the related proverb thus states 'it always rains on a festival'. JI use "paradigm here in the grammatical sense, e.g., as witn a verb paradigm that is constructed through the intersection of tense and person features, yielding a two-dimensional matrix of forms.</page><page sequence="3">Poetics and metaphor 1 43 ceptual metaphors of ideology are coordinated through a sys- tem of ritual poetics. To explain fully, the structural linguistic features of this poetic system is beyond the scope of this arti- cle (see King 1988:300-334), but the properties of the system can be summarized through example. The Poetics of Lightning The mythic model of sacrifice was characterized as having three conceptual elements: (a) the giver of the gift; (b) the recipient who returns sacrificial tokens; and (c) the gifts/tokens them- selves. Given three cosmic contexts, this yields nine discrete cat- egories. Each category is characterized by what may be called a poetic identity. For example, the three categories of 'gifts and tokens' each relate to a 'natural forces' metaphor, each with as- sociated poetic features. For the Center, 'Rain' is the metaphor for what passes between male and female. For the Sky, 'Wind' is the metaphor for the paths created by the movement of gifts and tokens between households. For the Earth, 'Lightning' is the metaphor for the 'food' that is exchanged between people and the spirits of the Earth in their mythic covenant. Each of these natural force metaphors has an associated poetic or mnemonic syllable (King 1988). The concept of Lightning is closely associated with the spiritual or vital force of an individual. Lightning is a 'heat' which is most concentrated in the heart of a person (King 1988:188-201). The modern word for this 'heated vitality' is yU (Monaghan 1987:487-568). Lightning is closely associated with the flesh (/?«), blood (nini), and bone ( yiqui ) of humans. By the same token, the vital 'heat' of spiritual beings that humans 'eat' is expressed through the same syllabic association, e.g., new ears of corn are termed 'nini9 and bean shoots are 'yiyi.9 Psy- chotropic mushrooms are another form of the Earth's flesh; two terms for these fungi are siyi and yi'i. The spiritual foods of humans and spirits are identically expressed in the poetics of Lightning. Many other words with poetic ties can be found for the dif- ferent conceptual senses of Lightning, including sets of terms relating to storm phenomena (lightning, hail, thunder), earth- quakes, ritual steam baths, and various senses of twisting, turn- ing, and revolving inward, associated with curly-hair symbolism, but also suggesting states of ritual intoxication.4 Even with the limitations of the sixteenth-century language sources, more than forty different words carry connotative meanings relating the poetics of Lightning to its mythic meanings (King 1988:194- 195). From these data it becomes clear that Lightning is poeti- cally associated with the syllables 'yi' and 'w.'5 This kind of poetic relationship is not without precedent; 4The modern concept of yU does not explicitly encompass the me- terological phenomenon of lightning, nor is this explicit in the colonial sources. But the structural articulations between yü and the concepts of Rain and Wind combined with the prominence of Lightning in Zapotee and Cuicatec ideology (Hunt 1977; Marcus 1989), make the identifica- tion of yU with Lightning inescapable. 5 In the paradigm of ideology and symbolism, all three categories pertaining to sacrifice in the context of the Earth are related through a poetic association with the two palatal consonants 'y' and 'n'. Simi- larly, all three categories of 'exchange substances', that is, Lightning, Rain, and Wind, are poetically associated with the vowels 'i' and 'i'. Each of the six parameters of the paradigm, that is, the three logical ele- ments of sacrifice and Rain, bears a poetic association; consonants are correlated with Earth, Center, and Sky, and vowels with the logic of sac- rifice (see King 1988:334-340). Barbara Tedlock observed a markedly similar poetic device in Quiche Maya ritual language: In practice, modern Quiche calendrical experts interpret a given day name by means of phrases that frequently include the sounds of its name but not the name as such; that is to say, the names are "read" not as words in themselves, but as a kind of oral rebus for quite other words . . . tz'i* means 'dog' in modern Quiche, but Momostecan calendricists reject any attempt to interpret Tz'i' days in terms of literal, méto- nymie, or metaphoric dogs. Instead, they apply one or more of the following mnemonics: tz'ilonic 'to be dirty, soiled, stained, impure', tz'iyalaj tzii 'jealous words', or catz'iyaric 'it is uncertain.' Each of these contains the syllable tz'i and thus involves a rhyme or poetic sound play on the day name Tz'i'. . . . In Momostenango it is interpretive phrases or mnemonics of the kind given here . . . rather than glosses of the day names, that are taught the novice during hours of preinitiation practice divinations. And it is these mnemonics, consisting of both single words and phrases, that are con- nected either directly (literally) or indirectly (figuratively, by means of metonymy, synedoche, and metaphor) with the client's problem. (Tedlock 1982:270) The symbolism of the Mixtee codices operates in much the same way, but encompasses the whole symbolic system, not just the ritual calendar. The symbolic composition of any particu- lar scene is organized in such a way as to either reinforce a poetic association or to highlight important ideological con- trasts. This can be seen in Figure 2; three pairs of nearly iden- tical figures are shown in the right column: two stone men, two tree men, and two black men holding bags. The conceptual and poetic values for 'stone' and 'tree' are related to the Earth and Sky, respectively, a contrast that is repeated in the left column as two other stone men descend toward a white tree (King 1988). 6 The caption names of the third pair, tell us they sym- bolize the Center and Rain, as we shall see later. Ritual Metaphors and Calendar Symbolism The syllabic patterning associated with 'Lightning' and other ideological categories give a mnemonic or poetic quality to co- dex symbolism. Like poetry, this relationship is an intentionally creative correlation of the 'music' of language with ideological or mythic meaning (Friedrich 1986:39). The scribes of the Mix- tec codices used symbols to guide the poetic character of the story; this implies the codices also function as a guide for oral recitation (see Monaghan 1990:133-140; also King 1982:43-84, 1988:277-313). The Mixtee 260-day ritual calendar comprises a special sub- set within the larger system of poetics and symbolism. Special in the sense that the relationship between words, concepts, and symbols is more systematic and more complex. Throughout Mesoamerica, the ritual calendar operates in various divinatory capacities, as seen earlier in Tedlock's description of modern Maya day-keeping. The ancient Mixtee ritual calendar surely possessed similar divinatory functions (Marcus 1983), but we also know of certain other special characteristics. Most striking 6The contrast of stone and tree appeals to the contrast between the 'source of the gift' in contexts of Earth and Sky. In the poetic and sym- bolic correlates of the paradigm, the 'source for the Sky' is chiefly as- sociated with the 'tree' of elite lineage, symbolized by the white tree in Figure 2; the 'source for the Earth' is primarily associated with Earth spirits, ñuhu , and, by extension, with 'stone', yuu.</page><page sequence="4">1 44 King is the use of special terms for the day names and numbers, a fact that has long been recognized (Caso 1977:1:163-164; Smith 1973:22-27), although the terms have never been systematically analyzed.7 These terms are quite curious in their formal char- acteristics. Each of the thirteen number terms has only one syllable, yet all Mixtee words have two syllables. The twenty day names are similarly curious: they can be expressed as either a complete two-syllable word, or as a single-syllable abbre- viation: 8 1 ca Earth Monster quivui, qui 2 cua Wind chi 3 co House cuayu, cua 4 cui Lizard cuyi, cu 5 cu Serpent y oco, yo 6 ño Death maa, ma 7 sa Deer cuaha, cua 8 na Rabbit sayu, sa 9 qui Water nduta, ta 10 si Dog huaa, hua 11 si Monkey ñuu, ñu 12 cua Grass cuayi, yi 13 si Reed huiyu, yu Jaguar huidzu, dzu Eagle saya, sa Vulture cuii, cui Movement quihi, qui Knife cusi, si Rain savui, vui Flower huaco, co The use of this system to record dates is also problematic, from the analyst's point of view. Unlike the orderly Aztec chro- nologies, sequences of Mixtee dates have been difficult to un- derstand completely. There are always years and days recorded that do not fit into the genealogical records, forcing rather tor- tuous explanations for how a date relates to the history.9 Some dates reappear in similar contexts, most often in contexts of mythological origins. Fürst (1978a, 1978b) argued that these mythic dates are not chronological in nature; instead, they con- vey metaphoric meaning associated with their context. This was the first realization that calendar signs might have nonchrono- logical meanings. As I will show, the meanings are actually en- coded in the day signs themselves, and are based on the syllabic values of the special calendar vocabulary. In this discussion, calendar signs not conveying temporal information are termed captions. However, the special vocabulary for the ritual calendar is more than an arbitrary system of syllables. Each day name is a metaphor that pertains to the day sign and its associated ideo- logical and divinatory values. Many of these metaphors are dif- ficult to interpret. At first, certain terms seem so obscure in 7 It must be admitted the data are fragmentary and difficult to em- ploy for several day-names and numbers, but a comparative analysis of the data presented in Caso (1977) resolves some problems; the poetic correlates of ideology resolve others. 8Whichever of the two syllables is used in the shortened form is al- ways employed in single-syllable usages, never the other syllable. 9An infamous instance is that of the caption 10(5+5)-Knife, in front of Lord 2-Rain, seated in the center of page 8 of the Nuttall co- dex. The chronological insolubility of this date has resulted in creative explanations including theories of astronomical significance as well as several that propose a special supernatural context, since, according to the chronology of the story, 2-Rain is dead by this date. In fact, it is a simple caption that reads 4 si-cusi , cusi' meaning 'take arms, we go to battle'; according to Byland and Pohl (personal communication, 1988), they go to war with neighbors only days later. meaning as to be unintelligible. A few yield some insight, like the name for the day sign depicting a jaguar's head, huidzu , roughly meaning 'the authoritative words or edict of an elite'. This day name and several others have narrowly focused mean- ings, and in fact appear to be metonymically related to their day signs, that is, a "one part for the whole" relationship. Thus, an elite edict is one important feature functioning to support elite class status. In English, we use 'throne' and 'crown' in the same way. But there are additional considerations. The day name for 'Reed' is huiyu meaning ' milpa '. Not only is this the only mean- ing for huiyu in the colonial sources, it is an unusual word; itu is the conventional term. Clearly there is some reason why 'Reed' is related to 'field' and why an unusual word is used to denote the meaning 'field'. A more detailed inspection is re- quired to illustrate the semantic organization of day names and signs. The Wind and the Knife In the codices, there is a strong symbolic relationship between sacrificial knives and the mythic concept of the Wind. The wind-mask is a principal attribute of the culture-hero, Lord 9- Wind; in his capacities as social and ritual teacher, he embod- ies the concept of Wind as the paths and ties of social exchange (King 1988:250-411). In the Vienna codex, Lord 9-Wind is plainly shown as the literal offspring of a great sacrificial knife (page 49d), implicitly linking Wind with knife symbols. In conventional speech, this relationship is also evident; the terms for knife ( yuchi ), wind ( tachi ), and path ( ichi ) all share a 'chi' syllable. Furthermore, the poetic "syllable" for Wind is chi (analogous to yi, for Lightning), and the day name for Wind is chi.10 But the day name for Knife is cusi, meaning 'throw (a weapon) with the arm', among other things. While this avoids poetic ambiguities between day names, the idea of Knife as a 'thrown weapon' is inadequate as a conceptual value for the day sign. In the sixteenth century sources, only one set of meanings exist for cusi, which is actually one of a pair of verb stems ( cusi/sasi ). Mixtee verbs often display this type of syllabic al- ternation, distinguishing between the future and present tenses of the verb.11 This feature of Mixtee verbs plays a major role in codical poetics. The principle is simple. Whereas nouns and adjectives tend to be poetically related through syllables, as seen in the poetics of Lightning, different verbs tend to show poetic relationships if they share one stem form. To illustrate this, I return to the day name cusi. The verb cusi/sasi means 'to throw with the arm', and is used in expressions for 'pummel', 'besiege', 'ambush', 'spear- thrower', and, in a colonial extension, 'arquebus'. But it also means 'to plant', 'to sow', and 'to plow'. I take this to be a mythic allusion to the covenant with the Earth. The planting of crops, using a coa (digging stick) is an attack on the body of the Earth. But the action is also one that induces plant growth and ultimately produces food, and so is both life generating and life sustaining. These mythic senses are supported in poetics, sym- bolism, and ethnography. Poetically, cusi/sasi is related to 10The day name for Wind, chi, is the only name for which there is no evidence of a 'fulF two syllable version. 11 Properly speaking, the verb pairs express the potentiative and continuative aspects of the verb; the past is formed by prefixing ni- to the potentiative ('k'-initial form) form.</page><page sequence="5">Poetics and metaphor 1 45 casi/sasi (through the shared form, sasi), meaning 'to eať, 'to bite', and 'to consume*; also closely related is cadzi/sadzi, meaning 'to suckle/nurse*, and 'to eať. In Nuyoo, the planting and care of corn plants has definite sexual overtones. The digging stick is a metaphor for an erect penis, and the verb for sowing seed can be used to describe in- tercourse. At harvest, the farmer is seen as the 'father* of the ears of corn; indeed he is figuratively married to the corn plant, who is the 'daughter of the Rain*. The farmer may offer pulque to the Earth-spirits of the corn field so that they may help make the crop grow well, but the symbolism of the offering is one of semen (male white blood), helping to fertilize the corn (Mona- ghan 1987:510-511). The mythic allusion can also be traced in the symbolism of the codices. In the Vienna codex, the mythological image of corn is that of a young maiden; this image is still quite vital to- day in Nuyoo. Twice, the corn maiden is explicitly associated with the caption, Year 5-Knife, Day 5-Knife (Vienna codex 47b, 12b). In the latter context, she is shown with a near-twin female named 7-Knife. The single-syllable day name for Knife is si. The number 'five* is cu , and the number 'seven* is sa ; the caption 5- Knife is thus cusi , and 7-Knife is sasi. The mythological notions of the covenant with the Earth and the role of corn in that covenant is inextricably entwined with the senses of the pain, sacrifice, and nurturing implicit in the myth. The sacrificial knife, equally a symbol of life and death, epitomizes the life sustaining pain of self sacrifice. Fur- thermore, the symbolism of the knife, both as day sign and in other contexts, carries a meaning approximating 'agent/instru- ment of spiritual nourishment*. Like a digging stick, a knife pierces the body introducing (or releasing) necessary sustenance. The Poetics and Interpretation of Captioning The examination of the concepts related to the day 'Knife* in word and symbol partially illustrates the complex interplay of language and symbolism that is inherent in the ritual calendar. I also offered a simple example of a caption. By associating corn with the caption cusi (/sasi), several logical relationships are emphasized. Most importantly, the caption/subject pairing focuses which values of the verb cusi are to be stressed in ref- erence to corn.12 This is an important function of captioning: to provide the poetic parameters for associated symbolic con- structions. Captions provide another set of syllabic cues for the singer or narrator, like miniature, compressed, sacred poems - stripped of every detail except essential ideological sentiment and rhymes. The cusi caption for corn is not the verbal text for the corn maiden; it is, rather, a map of the conceptual and poetic logic to be incorporated into the text. For us, they also serve as a guide to symbolic meaning, and the means through which we can understand Precolumbian Mixtee ideology. Captions present a set of options to the reader. In some in- stances, the reading is almost obligatory, presenting few alter- natives. In other instances, especially in complete Year-Day captions, interpretive options are more complex. The rules and operations for reading captions are as follows: First, every cap- tion is composed of two or three syllables: the number term (one syllable), and the day name (one or two syllables). These 12For example, cusi could communicate information regarding warfare, as in the example given in note 9. syllables are then used to construct an appropriate word or phrase. The first option given to the reader is a choice of the two- syllable or one-syllable form of the day name. Depending on the option taken, there are five possible ways to write a caption; to illustrate the mechanics, I will use nonsense Mixtee syllables and words. Thus, for a sequence of three syllables, yi ti(mu) (where ti is the 'short' day name), possible constructions include: (1) yi- timu, (2) yiti-mu, (3) y iti, (4) y ii tii, and (5) tiyi, which reverses the syllable order. By far, the majority of captions in the Vienna codex appear to be of types (1) and (3), but important excep- tions exist.13 For example, an important ñuhu, or Earth-spirit, in the Vienna codex is Lady 1 -Eagle. She is the spiritual per- sonification of rivers and sweatbaths (Fürst 1978a). The only logical way to interpret her name as a caption (1 -Eagle = ca sa(ya)) is a reflection of the verb 'to take a sweatbath,' or 'to be purified': caa/saa. Captions can also be written as a compound. In the Vienna codex, the dots used for caption number-elements are often painted in such a way as to express the number as a sum of two or more smaller values.14 For example, the seven dots of '7- Serpent' can be broken into '4' and '3'; this means that three captions should be considered in analysis: 7-Serpent, 4-Serpent, and 3-Serpent. To indicate the nature of compound captions in reference, I use the following style: 7(4+3)-Serpent. In theory, there would seem to be too many possible alter- natives in a caption to be useful; but in practice, potential con- structions often produce nonsense. Bear in mind there are only 28 distinct syllables (counting numbers and short day names), far short of the minimum number of forms required for a fully developed syllabic writing system. But captions are a formal ex- tension of the divinatory system; literacy, in the conventional sense, is not an issue. To develop the captioning system into a full syllabary would almost certainly distort or transform the ritual calendar and its related, divinatory functions. As it is, the limited captioning syllabary actually duplicates syllabic values; the number terms for two and twelve ( cua ), and ten, eleven, and thirteen (si) are the same, and the terms for three (co) and five (cu) effectively function as the same syllable, as well.15 1 believe these redundant features of the number system reflect important divinatory associations. 13This might not be exactly the same case in other codices, which is to say that different painters have different styles of caption composi- tion, but the range of types would remain essentially the same. Please note also regarding patterns (1) and (4): syllables that are 'promoted' to word status take one of two potential forms: ca &gt; caa or caha. 14The conventions used to designate sub-groups of numbers varies from codex to codex. In the Vienna, where the concentration of cap- tions (vs. real dates) is highest, color differentiation is used. If no sub- groupings are intended, then the sequence of dots is randomly colored or of a single color. Three examples of compound captions are included in the analysis of Figures 2 and 3. 15Although there are few instances of caption consonants having poetically motivated shifts (as with 'y' and 'n' for Lightning), vowels can be 'altered' according to historically important 'strong/weak' pairs (Jos- serand 1983:269-270): a/e, i/i, and o/u (see note 5). For example, the caption '3-Knife' pairs co with si, but there is no word 'cos/' in the six- teenth century sources; this gives two options: coo-cusi or, by chang- ing the vowel to its 'strong' version, cusi. In the story of Lady 3-Knife and her daughter 3-Knife, on pages 14-22 of the Nuttall, both possibil- ities are emphasized: (1) both women are symbolically playing the mythic role of the corn maiden, Lady 5-Knife, in the story, and their '3-Knife' name-captions emphasize this association. (2) Throughout the story, the green feathered serpent is associated with the two women named 3-Knife: that is, a 'a/s/'-serpent (coo-cusi).</page><page sequence="6">1 46 King The divinatory aspect of the ritual calendar also helps us to understand why there seems to be a smaller number of identi- fiable, that is, interpretable, captions in the genealogical codices. In all likelihood, a trained codex scribe could poetically gloss any name or date, using the same set of syllabic and poetic conventions used for "mythic" captions. Such speculation sug- gests that Mixtee calendar specialists were not unlike Aztec and Maya specialists, as well as modern astrologers, who can derive multiple meanings for the luck associated with a single birth- date. Interpretive flexibility is important to the system. Thus, in an historical narrative, where names and dates are important to the political value of the codex, captions are chiefly used to communicate the significance of mythic and ritual contexts and the functions of named ritual attendants. As a rule, compound numbers are rarely used to record actual dates or the names of rulers, a fact that gives some guidance in the distinction between names, dates, and captions. But rather than dwell on the limitations and redundancies of the captioning syllabary, we should seek to understand its in- herent capabilities. Most striking in this respect is the fact that all the number values (except six and eight) begin with 'k', 'kw', and 's'; this reflects the most dominant alternation patterns in stem-changing verbs (like cusi/sasi , caa/saa , and casi/sasi ex- amples already seen). Thus, much of the word-play in captions is structured around verbs and their stem-changing features. In a highly symbolic context like the codices, this makes sense. Subjects are easily rendered pictographically, and they can be modified through symbolic elaboration. Verbs are another mat- ter and present special difficulties in the format of the codices. Captions solve this compositional problem elegantly and efficiently. Armed with this brief description of captioning, we turn to an example to be used in the following commentary. Year 1-Reed, Day 1 -Earth-Monster was first recognized by Fürst (1978b) to be a nonchronological metaphor for origins. The caption is widely found in the genealogical manuscripts, most often at the beginning of mythic preambles. It probably repre- sents an traditional oral formula, not unlike those of Homer. Consequently, the semantic loading is more densely metaphoric than for many captions. In the following analysis, each viable option for construction is used and listed separately. After both halves have been unfolded in this way, a translation is pro- posed. This same analytical format will be used in the follow- ing commentary. (A) 1-Reed ( ca -(hui)yu) to go out to the corn field ( ca-huiyu ) to count, to read in order ( cahui-yu ) to consume with heat ( cay u ) (B) 1 -Earth-Monster ( ca-qui ( vui )) to extend time/days/names (ca-quivui) to anoint/sow with seed (caqui) Thus begins the counting of the days; thus begins the reading of names. Thus the fields are consumed and sown anew; thus the fields are anointed with Rain. The first couplet emphasizes the more literal function of the caption as a symbol for a narrative and mythic beginnings; the second couplet expresses the same idea in the form of a meta- phor for the sacred beginning of a new agricultural cycle. Figure 1 . Vienna Codex, p. 50b-50c. THE SPIRITUAL UNION AT THE WHITE TREE The Vienna codex is a record of the origins of the Mixtee uni- verse and the principles of its ritual maintenance. These mat- ters are presented and embedded within a discourse of sacred ritual gifts and counter-sacrifices, as defined earlier. The Vienna codex at first appears to consist of a series of loosely related descriptions of offerings, births, and ritual formulae. When ideological concepts are taken into consideration, the narrative structure becomes more clear. The codex presents the story of Mixtee origins as a logical progression, beginning with a sym- bolic inventory in the primordial chaos, in the darkness, before time and before places, when land, water, and sky were one. The Vienna codex tells many stories; at one level, it is a story of the culture hero, Lord 9-Wind, beginning with the sacrifices required for his birth, going to his separation of the Earth from the waters of the Sky, and ending with his ritual guidance and instruction in all primary ritual matters. At another level, this is a story of social development from an era of solitary, pre- social, Earthly entities (Monaghan 1987:540-543), to the forma- tion of the first household, through the establishment of inter-household social rituals at the community level (i.e., Earth to Center to Sky as a social transformation). At still other lev- els, this myth represents a socioeconomic charter of gift- sacrifice hierarchies and political realities from the perspective of the Mixtee elite class. The Mythic Context of the Union at the Tree The scene from the Vienna codex being analyzed is reproduced in Figures 1 through 3. Analysis begins with the last character on page 50b, and continues through the fourth element on page 49a. This scene at the white tree is only the second event in the narrative, following the listing of the offspring of Lord and Lady 1-Deer who live in the timeless darkness together with other ancient couples. The offspring of this Earth couple are a collection of spiritually ťhoť males (page 51a), and a number of serpent-males, stone-men, tree-men, and a few other curious individuals (page 51b-50b). These represent the presocial race of beings still preserved in modern Mixtee myth. In many ver- sions, these solitary beings were turned to stone at the first ris- ing of the Sun (Dyk 1959). But a number of special, living stones are specifically created following the scene at the white tree (page 49a-49d); the last of these stones is the knife that gives birth to Lord 9-Wind. The scene at the white tree is iconographically represented as a gathering of Earth-spirits, or ñuhu , at the location of a</page><page sequence="7">Poetics and metaphor 1 47 Figure 2. Vienna Codex, p. 50c-50d. Figure 3. Vienna Codex, p. 50d-51a. white tree. Two stone ñuhu descend onto the tree with the same incense-burning ladle offering used by the couple 1 -Deer/ 1 -Deer to produce their offspring. This scene is therefore a symbolic representation of a life-generating interaction between differ- ent kinds of solitary spiritual entities, in this case between stone men and a tree-female. The symbolism of this union, and of the attending pairs of males, is one of Earth and Sky, as discussed earlier. The opposition is not an empty one, for the poetics of the scene, as we shall see, are filled with allusions to Rain, the state of union between Earth and Sky. The tree is literally impregnated, and ritual preparations for the emergence of the offspring are begun by 9-Wind immedi- ately (page 38c) following his separation of the Sky from the Earth. The four pairs of figures directly involved in the union (Figure 2) are present at the birth (page 37a), where the same two blackened males named 7-Rain and 7-Eagle physically split open the tree with tools (page 38b). Emerging from the tree are seven sets of ritual assistants who conduct the first seven main- tenance rituals (pages 22-11) following the first appearance of the sun (page 23b). The one common central focus in each of these maintenance rituals is the use of the fire-drill, which is an- other extension of the metaphor for union between Earth and Sky. Other offspring of the tree are the participants of the first marriage, including the bridegroom, and the mother and father of the bride; the marriage preparations immediately follow the tree-birth scene. So, in one sense, the purpose of the union at the tree is to generate (a) the personnel needed to establish the first household, and (b) the specialists needed to maintain the ritual orderliness required to perpetuate social existence, just as the "purpose" of the ancient couple 1 -Deer/ 1 -Deer is to produce the offspring required to bring about the union at the tree. Symbolic Oppositions and Poetic Inverses The scene is introduced by two warrior figures followed by a large jeweled year-sign and the date, Year 5-Knife, Day 5-Knife (Figure 1). Fürst interprets this as the beginning of time, partly based on the fact that this is the first use of the year sign in the codex (Fürst 1978:67-71). I believe this interpretation to be cor- rect. It is the beginning of ritual time, the ritual 260-day count of the days. The first date, 5-Knife, 5-Knife, is apt; the mean- ing is cusi, which is the name of the day 'Knife', as well as the caption for 5-Knife (cm + si), as discussed earlier. Recall that cusi/sasi means 'to throw (a weapon) with the arm' and 'to pummel' as well as 'to plant' and 'to plow'. This was interpreted as an allusion to the covenant with the Earth, given the exten- sive symbolic connections of Knife, the digging stick, and corn with the poetics of eating and nourishment. The use of this date, together with two warrior figures with arms raised to throw weapons (cusi), indicates that concepts of ritual time relate to the extended ideological senses of 'Knife'. Furthermore, the beginning of time coincides with the impreg- nation of the 'tree of social life'. The metaphor relating 'plant- ing' with an 'attack on the body' is extended such that the origins of ritual time are related to the act of planting. The people at the scene define the nature of this first plant- ing in the symbolic opposition of tree and stone, that is, Sky and Earth, as discussed earlier. Both entities are symbolically represented as 'stone', yuu , indicated by the paired 'bumps' on the outlines of their bodies. Although the first appearance of the face of Rain is beneath the feet of 9-Wind as he lifts the Sky three pages later, the symbolic opposition of tree and stone in this scene poetically emphasizes Rain, for Rain implies the union of Earth and Sky literally and figuratively. The two stone men who descend onto the tree have teeth that are symbolic attributes of Rain. They are, poetically, 'yu' (stone) + 'wi' (Rain). The tree is named 9-Reed; elsewhere in the codex, she is depicted in human form (Fürst 1977). The day 'Reed' is huiyu. As with other day names, the denotative mean- ing is quite narrow. The only meaning aside from 'Reed' is milpa. But the word huiyu is the syllabic inverse of the poetics of the Stone/Rain men; rendered as a word, the men axeyuvui, meaning petate ('wi-yu' vs. 'yu-wi'). This is no coincidence. The meanings of the two terms have much the same ideological significance. Both terms, milpa and petate , allude to the 'bed' upon which Earth and Sky unite. But</page><page sequence="8">1 48 King the poetics go much deeper. The symbolic representation of the milpa in this scene is a green and white feather mat. We know from toponymie research that such a feather mat is a tonal pun on the word for 'large feather' yodzo , which is homonymie, ex- cepting tone, with the word for 'plain' (Smith 1973:38-41). The verb yodzo/ codzo means 'to mount', or 'to get on top', adding a sexual connotation to the petate metaphor. As was illustrated earlier with cusi/sasi , the verb yodzo /codzo relates to another verb through codzo : the verb codzo /sadzo means 'baptize', 'to anoint', 'to nourish', 'to irrigate', and 'to wash nixtamaV , the lime-soaked, pre-ground, form of corn, or, expressed meta- phorically, 'to bless with nourishing liquid'. In the symbolic organization of the scene at the tree, the poetic device of syllable inversion or reversal plays a prominent role. The 'yuvui '-males and Lady 9-Reed form one pair of in- verses. Although there is no poetic inverse for yodzo , the syl- labic inverses of codzo and sadzo do extend the poetic and symbolic relationships in the scene. The inverse of codzo is dzoco meaning 'sacrifice' and ' nixtamal water'. The connota- tions from the inverse of sadzo ('bless with liquid') are partic- ularly interesting: dzusa is the 'essence' of a body in the senses of 'sap/resins/incense', 'saliva', and 'obsidian'. With the excep- tion of obsidian, these substances, together with ash ( yaa ), are all symbolically depicted using the same general 'speckled' motif which can be seen in the two flaming disks that lie on the milpa's feather mat in this scene. Conceptually, substances that are watery, sticky, or clinging, that can be held or manipulated in the hand, are poetically and symbolically related. They are like male 'white blood' or semen, and female 'white blood' or milk, and have special nourishing properties, as does red blood in the covenant with the Earth. The poetics related to the 'sleeping mat' symbolism of Earth/Sky opposition consistently describes the union at the white tree in terms of 'the place of Rain (male white blood)', and the physical nature of Rain (nourishing, softening, making a sticky mass), in a variety of senses, including a conspicuous set of meanings pertaining to the preparation of corn. The 'sub- stance' of Rain is symbolically conspicuous in this scene, too. The descending ' yuvuť have one such substance in their hand; the other hand holds a smoking incense ladle, which consumes these resins. The two black-bodied attendants carry possible in- cense bags that appear to be related to rituals of fertility in other contexts and in other codices. The burning disks on the milpa , also carry this connotation, as does the final symbol in the scene (Figure 3), the vessel filled with a dark gray mass. Recall, also, that curing rituals emphasize the making of mud from dirt mixed with pulque or saliva, creating a Rain-like substance with healing powers (Mak 1959). Thus, even if we cannot positively identify the different speckled substances in Figures 2 and 3, we can understand how the symbolic motif relates to more general ideological metaphors. The Captions The captions pertaining to the Union at the white tree, sup- port the poetics of the symbolism and clarify the 'text' for this scene, beginning with the caption for the Year/Day 5-Knife 'cw-(cw)s/': (I) 5-Knife (cu-(cu)si) to throw (a weapon) with the arm to pummel, attack, ambush to plant, to plow The the pair who carry the white bags carry the next set of captions: 7(4+3)-Eagle and 7(3+2+2)-Rain.16 The first set of captions reads: (IIa) 7-Rain (sa-(dza)vui) rain, make rain (lib) 3-Rain (co-(dza)vui) he who accompanies ( cuvui ) the rain-serpent ( coo-dzavui ) (lie) 2-Rain ( cua-(dza)vui ) the rain will come the approach of rain the time/place of rain (Ilia) 7-Eagle (sa-sa(ya)) make an exchange relationship (sa-saha) (Illb) 4-Eagle (cui-sa(ya)) the relationship is eternal ( cuisa ) (IIIc) 3-Eagle ( co-sa(ya )) he who was called to attend ( cusa/sisa ) The two individuals carrying the bags, and who later cut into the tree to release the fruit of the union, bear captions em- phasizing the convocation of the personnel and the union to occur. The two dates on either side of the tree are the next captions. The first date is associated with Lady 9-Reed, the white tree in this scene. (IV) 13(5+5+3)-Rabbit: (a) 13-Rabbit ( si-sayu ) male genitals are introduced/ingested (b) 5-Rabbit ( cu-sayu ) male genitals descend (c) 3-Rabbit ( co-sayu ) male genitals are seated in place (V) 9-Reed (qui-hui(yu)) the body of the milpa the sown milpa the milpa that will ripen (VI) 3-House ( co-cua(yu )) it will be sown ( co-cuayu ) it will crack/split open ( co-cuañu ) (VII) 7-Rain (sa -(dza)vui) make rain Below the milpa , are two other attendants, who carry feather- offerings. Their name-captions read: (VIII) 9(5+4)-Lizard: (a) 9-Lizard ( qui-cu ) it was pinned in place, it was sewn/stitched (quku) (b) 5-Lizard ( cu-cu ) it caught fire (coco) it will thicken and swell ( cucu ) (c) 4-Lizard (cui-cu) it will take root (cuico) (IX) 7-Rain (sa-(dza)vui) make rain Now come the last two captions, to the left of these two at- tendants. The first caption, appropriately, is the 'origins' date, Year 1-Reed, Day 1 -Earth-Monster, discussed earlier, followed by another caption, Year 5-House, Day 7(4+3)-Serpent. This is the first instance of the origins date in the Vienna. The lat- ter caption is related to the serpent-basin symbol above it; the symbol-caption pairing occurs four more times in the codex. (X) l-Reed (see caption analysis, (A), above) (XI) 1 -Earth-Monster (see caption analysis, (B), above) (XII) 5-House (cu-cua(yu)) it will be reseeded (co-cuayu) it will crack/split open (co-cuañu) 16The 3-2-2 compound is associated with 7-Rain, pictured here in Figure 2 with no coumpound number, when he is first shown on 50a with his 'partner' 7-Eagle and the other three pairs in Figure 2. 1 have therefore incorporated this 'alternate' captioning into the analysis of 7-Rain's name-caption.</page><page sequence="9">Poetics and metaphor 1 49 (XIII) 7(4+3)-Serpent: (a) 7-Serpent (sa-yo{ co)) male genitals (sayu) (b) 4-Serpent ( cui-yo(co )) balled-up, twisted, tightened (cuiyo/siyo) to change from one state to another ( siyo ) (c) 3-Serpent (co-yo(co)) it dissolves, it softens ( coyo ) A Reading of the Captions and Their Interpretation Based on the preceding caption analyses, the following is a rough translation of the caption 'text' of Figures 1 through 3: (I) The darts were thrown down; the shafts were planted in place. (II, III) To make Rain, to come with the Rain, they are called, and they will accompany, to the place of Rain, to the place of exchange. (IV, V) Thus the sacred body of the milpa was fertilized; the Heat of male blood was seated in her house; (VI, VII) They will split (her); it will crack open. It will be seeded and reseeded, there where they make Rain. (VIII, IX) Their darts pierced the milpa , and the milpa caught fire; Rain will cause it to take root, and Rain will make it thicken and swell. (X, XI) Thus begins the counting of (her) days; Thus begins the reading of (her offspring's) names. Thus the milpa is sown with Heat; Thus the milpa is anointed with Rain. (XII, XIII) The milpa will crack open; they will split her open. The male blood will twist-up, it will tighten her belly; it will soften (her), it will form anew. The final symbolic elements of the two vessels (Figure 3) roughly correspond to the two halves of the last caption. The first symbol is a U-shaped serpent, with a head on both ends, and a dart embedded in the bottom. The second is a similar stone vessel filled with a gray, malleable mass. The caption, 5- House, describes the action of the dart 'splitting' the vessel, and later these Earth-spirits reassemble to split open the tree, releas- ing its offspring. In Nuyoo, serpents are explicitly identified with female genitals (Monaghan 1987:448). This fact, combined with the 'attacking' sense of 'planting' defines the significance of the first vessel. The second vessel is described in the caption, 7(4+3)-Serpent, as a 'transforming, hardening, mass'. Consider Nuyooteco beliefs on conception and pregnancy: The fetus is produced by male 'white liquid'. [This] is male blood which flows from all over his body when he becomes 'hot' during the sexual act. When [it] enters a woman in suf- ficient quantities, it slowly clots, and begins to grow. The sex- ual act must be repeated up to ten times for a woman to receive enough ... to allow her to become pregnant. As this theory of birth suggests, the woman is seen as a receptacle in which the fetus grows, and she does not contribute in any sig- nificant way to the physical make-up of her child. . . . This [same] process is compared to one where rain, which is likened to male blood, falls in sufficient quantity over an extended period of time to engender its children, the plants, in the womb of the earth. As one Nuyooteco put it: 'Corn without water is like a woman who does not have sexual re- lations . . . since neither will bear fruit'. In this way the in- teraction of earth and sky ... is understood in terms which parallel Nuyooteco understanding of the sexual relations of human male and female. (Monaghan 1987:156, 453) This is the essence of the meaning symbolized in spiritual union at the white tree. The context of the scene within the myth, the poetics and symbolism, and the captions each give a slightly dif- ferent, but complementary description of Rain as a metaphor for sexual union. The notion of the female as a 'safe-keeping' container also agrees with the symbolism of the white tree, es- pecially in the way that the offspring are later literally chopped out by 7-Rain and 7-Eagle. The 'building up' of male blood is poetically carried in this scene through the ' cusV metaphor re- lating the throwing of darts in war, the use of the digging stick in sowing, and the use of sayu (penis) in sexual relations; in each case the 'weapon' needs to be used repeatedly to achieve the desired results. But this is the logic, not the tenor, of the scene on page 50. The descending yuvui are not shown as warriors, but as males who embody Heat and Movement (in the sense of the Day-sign Movement/Earthquake that adorns the body of the upper male, and the flames on the body of the other); they are the 'heated' virility of the Earth, bearing offerings with symbolic and poetic relationships to male blood. But neither does the scene even show the feminine component as remotely anthropomorphic. She is merely a container, and the yuvui fill it with the offer- ings they bring. In the final captions and symbols, she is fur- ther reduced in visual significance to simple profiles of vessels, like a pot of corn, soaking in lime water. In the end, the mythic context of the scene reminds us this is the first making of Rain: a social action between morpholog- ically different, inherently solitary, Earth-spirits. But this ac- tion, which engages the 260-day 'clock' of social and ritual life, establishes a nurturing relationship between the Earth and Sky that will be perpetuated and maintained by the social offspring to emerge from the union. This is the significance of the Vienna codex myth, in general, and of Rain, in particular. SUMMARY The pioneering work of Caso and Jiménez Moreno laid the modern foundations for Mixtee codex analysis, and it is on these supports that we continue to build our understanding of these fascinating manuscripts. But over the years we have tended to forget the rich symbolic dimension of the codices. With an ever increasing mastery of the chronology and topo- nymie data (Byland and Pohl 1990; Pohl and Byland 1990) an understanding of codex symboli$m becomes more urgent and exciting. By putting sociocultural meaning back into our anal- yses, the Mixtee codices become virtual archives of Precolum- bian Mixtee ideology. Patient, systematic use of these 'archives' yields a vast wealth of sociopolitical and ideological information. The analysis of symbolic systems in a prehistoric context re- quires attention to many different types of data, but analytical comparison between types must eventually go beyond compar- ison of elements to the comparison of analogous structures and, ultimately, to a comparison of logical relations between the</page><page sequence="10">1 50 King structures. Of course, without the Vienna codex this enterprise would be even more difficult. We are indeed blessed to have this Song of the Rain, for it approximates the importance of the Rosetta Stone, gradually unfolding the symbolic system from a primordial structure of sacred concepts into intricate, paral- lel networks of sacred sociopolitical symbols. We could not ask for a better guide to understanding the politically motivated symbolism of the genealogical codices. SUMARIO En muchos estudios de los códices mixtecas, la historia ha atraído más atención que el rico simbolismo que impregna los manuscritos. Este ar- tículo revela diversas correlaciones entre la estructura linguistica mix- teca y la estructura simbólica de los códices mixtecas precolombinos. También propone la existencia de un sistema de escritura silábica que describe o encabeza los acontecimientos históricos o mitológicos y los individuos retratados en los códices. Tales códices aluden a los con- ceptos básicos de la creencia mixteca, incluyendo el pacto entre la Tierra y los seres humanos, la función de la lluvia como metáfora sexual para las relaciones periódicas que tienen lugar entre los espíritos de la Tierra y del Cielo, y otras diversas metáforas para la fuerza espiritual o vital del individuo. Al examinar los encabezamientos de una sección del Códice de Vienna, se hace posible elucidar varias escenas enigmáticas, particularmente las que tienen que ver con la unión de la Tierra y del Cielo en el "Arbol blanco," y, en términos más profundos, con el es- tablecimiento de una relación afectiva que será perpetuada y manten- ida por la prole de la Unión. El Códice de Vienna se ha mostrado como la fuente principal para la comprensión del simbolismo políticamente motivado de los códices genealógicos.
