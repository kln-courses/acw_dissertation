The well-known tradition- al Dreamtime concept encapsulated a dogmatically defined awareness that purposely ignored the passing of time and its causative consequences in favour of a rigid dichotomy of the all-important myth period and the inconsequential, temporal and ephemeral present. In post-contact times this view has gradually given way to a more processually orientated view which recognises the causal importance of ongoing history and shows interesting ideological ramifications. [Australian Aborigines, myth, history, religion, cosmology] Erich Kolig, Dr. phil. (Wien); Senior Lecturer in Anthropology at Univ. of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; - fieldwork in Australia, Afghanistan, India, Indonesia, and Vanuatu; - publi- cations: three books and numerous articles, mainly concerned with the society and culture of Australian Aborigines (see a. o. References Cited). Australian Aboriginal society, as is well under- stood now, traditionally was sublimely disinterest- ed in history and cultivated instead what may be called a staunch a-processual view of the world, so much so that in the anthropological discourse it was taken at times as an "ahistorical" society par excellence (not in the sense of a society without history, but one characterised by a complete ab- sence of a sense of history). This may be somewhat exaggerated, but it is quite true that prior to the onslaught of Western civilisation in various forms, it seemed to adhere to a view which ignored the causal fecundity of social and political process and the seminality of contemporary and future events, relying in their place on a notion of predetermined universal patterns which were supposed to work themselves out in all eternity and forever unchang- ing. Thus, aetiologically, causes and reasons for existing conditions were provided without recourse to historical process, satisfying nonetheless what is probably a universal human intellectual need: namely to explain the present in terms of the past. However, one has to be careful not to im- pute concepts and intellectual preconditions whose universality one may reasonably presuppose, but which on closer inspection may be found to be absent in some societies. In this vein it may turn out to be an exaggeration and an inappropriate superimposition to attribute to this society a notion of eternity, when it was clearly more preoccu- pied with the present than the long-term future. In a rather foreshortened vision of time Aborig- inal society juxtaposed the so-called Dreamtime or Dreaming, a dimension which paradoxically is timeless as well as lying in the past, but is neither of these entirely, with contemporariness, which is a rather shallow time-span centred on the present. Enshrined in the traditional concept of the Dream- time was the notion of "eternal" world immutabili- ty which rendered any, even the remotest interest in or recognition of history utterly obsolete. But more of that later. Not surprisingly this traditional condition of an obvious lack of history, sparked off in anthropol- ogy a lively interest in finding out to what extent a sense of history may in fact be contained in this seemingly ahistorical, timeless mythical percep- tion of the world, making myth a cryptic vessel of history as some events do become enshrined in it (see Hiatt 1975: 3ff., Maddock 1988: 20ff., Sutton 1988). Another pertinent interest, relevant to my theme, has been the question of this ahistoricity's relationship with politics, i.e., the steering of daily events in accord with a concern with the social status quo. To some extent this will be explored here as well as the complex relationship: how does an absence of a sense of history shape politics and vice versa, how do political events influence that sense; and once a sense of history has become established how is political thought shaped by it? My interest in the matter dates back to the 1970s and early 1980s, when I carried out field- work in the southern part of the Kimberley region of Western Australia, mainly in and around the town of Fitzroy Crossing, i.e., the area along both sides of the Fitzroy River, from its entry into the Indian Ocean nearly into the Central Kimberley plateau. While the overwhelming majority of Ab-</page><page sequence="2">50 Erich Kolig original people with whom I had contacts were speakers of Wolmadjeri (Walmatjarri), a language which at the time was widely spoken and in- deed served as lingua franca among many diverse groups, there were also others speaking different languages. As a somewhat rough generalisation it may be said that the Aboriginal population of the region fell into two (mainly linguistically based) sections: a minority descended from groups indige- nous to the Fitzroy River basin and a majority who were descended from "immigrants" from farther south, or had come themselves from there some decades ago. The former were speakers of Bunaba, Nyigina, and Gunian, the latter Wolmadjeri and Yulbaridja (a generic label referring to speakers of Wonggadjunga and other Western Desert lan- guages). In reality this division was not as clear-cut as this, insofar as many, whose "first" language had not been Wolmadjeri had adopted it as a major means of communication and this was especial- ly true for the younger generations. And not all Wolmadjeri speakers were migrants as some be- longed to groups who were originally indigenous to the southern parts of the Fitzroy basin and as a consequence had suffered the same fate as the Bunaba, Gunian, and Nyigina, namely becoming a minority in their own "country." These indigenous groups had suffered considerably from the early onslaught of colonisation, shrinking them in num- bers, and later, in this century, becoming overlayed by southern migrants, who had over a period of several decades come in successive waves from the fringes and the interior of the Western Des- ert. Since then there has been a considerable de- gree of intermarriage and intermixture between the two sides, producing hybrid cultural and linguistic conditions. But short of launching into a detailed historical consideration, this rough description of what in reality is a rather more complex situation must suffice. There is also another difference between these two sections, pertinent to our purpose. In the case of the "indigenes" the historical awareness of contact with Western civilisation and of its often traumatic consequences goes back about a hundred years, engendering a sense of history and denting the "mythical consciousness" (see below) much sooner than affecting more southern groups, especially those who had been shielded by the relative isolation of the Western Desert. Clearly the awareness of social and cultural change was much deeper and longer with these indigenous groups than with later arrivals. There was also another division splitting Ab- original society at the time of my fieldwork. This division was generation- and age-based or, more directly relevant to our theme, was profoundly influenced by educational factors. Generally, the younger generations have been educated in state and mission schools and this exposure to a Western type curriculum, which was missing in the case of older generations (especially the "migrants" from the south), has had a profound effect. The notion of historicity, which is an integral part of school education, is well entrenched with younger genera- tions. As a history consciousness has been instilled in them, subsequently it is not so much a matter for them to revise their myth consciousness - a task faced by the older generations -, but much rather a matter of synthesising and cognitively harmo- nising school-inspired views with the traditional worldview conveyed to them through religious and initiatory tuition by their elders. Religious initia- tion during the time over which I carried out my fieldwork was still a major learning experience for young Aboriginal males (especially for the off- spring of southern migrants), and to a lesser extent for females and the offspring of some indigenous groups. In this paper I wish to explore, firstly, how in Aboriginal society in the Kimberleys the myth- ically inspired view of the world and the static conception of the universe it entailed, have in post-contact times gradually metamorphosed in- to history consciousness, i.e., into a perspective which attributes significance to social and histori- cal process. Here I am speaking of a process of de- formation of the Dreamtime concept and a process of internal revision, while in the case of younger, school educated generations the problem is one of avoiding intellectual dissonance by establishing harmony between Western induced views and tra- ditional type learning. And secondly, I am going to explore to some extent how the newfound sense of history influences today's self-definition in a po- litical sense. That is to say, how political thinking has been enriched by historicity, opening up new dimensions and ways of articulating aspirations. Before I begin to look at the conditions through which a "sense of history" has emerged from an ahistorical matrix of awareness, and at the oral traditions which indicate the change, it is helpful to clarify the analytical premise on which this argument is founded. Mannheim (1952: 84ff.) stressed the dominant role which historicism plays in modern Western thinking: it determines our worldview by the way we approach phenomena ranging from politics to individual persons, organise social and cultural sci- ences, order our experience, and, indeed, perceive Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="3">A Sense of History and the Reconstitution of Cosmology in Australian Aboriginal Society 5 1 the whole world. We place everything, seeing it in terms of flux, within a framework of historical roots, origins, growth, trends, transformations, and future possibilities which may differ distinctly and fundamentally from present conditions. We do not see the social world ordered in terms of immutable, eternistic patterns, laid down once and for all, and in which events occur for ever repetitively. Rather we look at it as composed of individual events and situations which in themselves have import and causally shape future events. Such an historical type of Weltanschauung contrasts with the ahistorical, mythically based perception of the world in which things are seen to be unalterably given and where there is little concern with origins and processes. There are two qualifications which have to be made at this stage. In order to avoid endless- ly repeating the cumbersome label "ahistorical" I shall call the relevant mode of consciousness "mythical," even though strictly speaking mythical is not the logical opposite of historical. There is some justification for doing so in the fact that the ahistorical perspective I am discussing is squarely rooted in a mythical cosmology. I shall refer to this mythical attitude in the present tense, even though it is waning, because at the present time it would be premature to confine its existence totally to the past. The situation is in flux as to my knowledge modern historicist notions coexist with the traditional mythical perception. In Western society historicism is not very old. It came into being, Mannheim (1952: 85) asserts, after the religiously determined medieval picture of the world had disintegrated and when the subse- quent Enlightenment, with its dominant idea of su- pra-temporal Reason, had destroyed itself. Mann- heim apparently was somewhat ethnocentrically preoccupied with modern Western society, for he failed to see the situation in broader, universal terms. If, as Mannheim (1952: 85) says, it was "the historic process through which we lived (that) has turned us into historicists," similar processes in other societies might be expected to have en- gendered similar results, thus first teaching us to see ourselves as less unique and second, facilitat- ing the elicitation of general causative factors in the rise of this type of worldview. Indeed histor- icist inclinations, in various degrees of intensity can be found in many traditional societies. What Mannheim apparently saw as uniquely Western, is obviously just one extreme manifestation of a basic form of which other manifestations exist elsewhere; and what he conceived in terms of a quasi ideal type which contrasts sharply with an ahistorical view, in fact can be found in various shades of admixture and mutual interpénétration. The question of myth versus history and their relation to each other, is a complex problem.1 The assumption of a categorical perspective, for instance, easily leads to proposing that the mental processes respectively involved, are not akin, but are two completely different modes of knowing the world, separated by an unbridgeable epistemo- logical chasm. They may become identified with two dichotomous modes by which the world can be comprehended: reason and unreason. This is an intellectual heritage which has been with us since the Socratian School, taking a stance against Soph- ism, began pedantically to distinguish Logos from Mythos, the one being seen as a reasoned way of reflecting on the world, the other as irrational fabu- lating and irresponsible fabricating.2 What may in statu nascendi have been the defence mechanism of a fledgling rationalist world perception, later became firmly solidified in the view that myth and history constitute two irreconcilable catego- ries. Thus the argument may easily be carried into the field of epistemology : myth as it were becomes the outcome of irrational mental processes, while history is the reasonable and rational enterprise of illuminating the past, ancient and recent, as it really happened, in recognition of its significance to present social, cultural, and political conditions. In a sense, the logically opposite view to this 1 This results in a plethora of views and theories of which not all are internally consistent. Indeed some stress a certain degree of ambiguity. Lévi-Strauss is a case in point. He contends that historiography is just a kind of myth-making, as only a selection of past events are committed to recorded history, namely those subjectively seen as somehow signif- icant and usable as symbol carriers (cf. Lévi-Strauss 1963: 209f.). However, his position in this respect is far from unambiguous. While on the one hand often insisting on the respective autonomy of myth and history, on the other he has frequently and deliberately obscured the division. He calls history-recording a form of myth-making and myth-making a form of history (Lévi-Strauss 1978: 34-43). Myth, in his view, provides a kind of history as it refers to the beginnings of social institutions, cosmogony, and the like and thus myth and history serve the same function. He seems to share this position with R. Barthes (1973) who likewise tends to see myth as a perception of history and history as a mythical perception of the past. - An added difficulty in the debate is a semantic confusion which arises from the ambiguities of the term history which is used to denote the past as it exists independently of the subjectivities of knowing subjects, or the flow of time and the vicissitudes it brings, as well as the study, knowledge, and perception of the past. 2 Plato, for instance, wanted to banish Homer - metaphorical- ly for mythical, unbridled fantasy - from his Utopian state and replace the undisciplined vigour of traditional poetry with scientifically examined stories. Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="4">52 Erich Kolig epistemologically a-prioristic one, holds with a certain transitivity between the two categories myth and history. And this often has evolution- ary undertones. Myth is interpreted as a petrified, distorted, preliterate form of historiography, prim- itive man's attempt as it were at preserving, if often accidentally so, the past in accord with his observations and his belief of what is important in the flux of actual events. In other words, myth as a collective memory - and hazy record - of the past. In various form, this view can be found to underly evolutionary perspectives as diverse as the Marxist one and the theories of Tylor (1964: 62ff., 176), Freud, and Roheim. In the course of human mental and intellectual evolution, in time, this stage is overcome by a proper history consciousness cou- pled with a more scientific appraisal of the world. Related to this view, but without its evolution- ary trappings, is the one which simply sees myth as the receptacle of actual historical events. This view holds that bits and pieces of actual events, historical experience, and observations of the cul- tural and natural milieu always enter the process of mythopoesis and as they do they become pre- served in myth - like insects may accidentally have become entrapped in amber and thus have been preserved over millennia. Thus myth comes to form a fabric whose threads are historically true. Consequently, if the material, garbled and symbolically cocooned in myth, is properly deci- phered, secrets of the past can be unlocked. This view, as I shall mention later in more detail, is not uncommon in Aboriginal studies, and is also - to be taken less seriously - linked with the names of von Daeniken, Velikowsky, and other writers who argue that myths enshrine pieces of significant experiences from the past (be that experience with extraterrestrial visitors, comets, and other incisive happenings). In this paper I avoid expressly employing any of these perspectives. Rather I will confine myself to a more "pragmatic" understanding of the problem as it relates to a notion of social causality. A myth- ical awareness in relation to social life attributes no value to individual persons, to their achieve- ments, and to individual events. It tends to view the flux of life as surface manifestations of under- lying, eternal, mythically defined patterns, while history-consciousness is characterised by a certain causal open-endedness, i.e., events are not seen to be predetermined by divine or supernatural will, but as depending on antecedent events.3 1 attempt 3 History, however, may also be construed in terms of eter- nistic, quasi mythical configurations (Munz 1977: 113ff.). to show how an history-consciousness may arise gradually and continually from a mythical matrix of thought - without the latter having to disappear as a consequence. History does not supercede myth so as to preclude it, as the coexistence of mythic and religious paradigms on the one hand and a fervent interest in history on the other in Western society testifies. This is perhaps comparable to the evolutionary emergence of a new species, in which the phylogenetically older species which has served as genitor, is not doomed to disap- pear, but lives on. However, despite such cryptic evolutionary implications, I purposely eschew the question whether or not the transmutation repre- sents an increase in verisimilitude. The problem remains untackled, whether history consciousness is superior in terms of its closer approximation to the truth, based as such an assertion would have to be on the probably unprovable assumption that social causality as assumed in history conscious- ness (i.e., causal chains operating from the past into the present) is truer than a priori causality. Doing so, would implicitly have to be done by discrediting quite respectable a-prioristically based theorems such as genetic determinism and struc- turalism, and others assuming a mainly contextual social causality such as functionalism. 1. Aboriginal Cosmology and History There could be no better and more striking contrast to Western historicism than the Aboriginal view of the world as it traditionally existed. As Stan- ner (1966: 148, 139) has observed, Aboriginal mentality was profoundly ahistorical in outlook. Phrasing it somewhat hyperbolically, he called it "a painful wrench for a European mind to have to deal with so shallow a perspective on time, and with mentalities that are ahistorical in outlook while asserting the contrary" (1966: 148). This is of course somewhat of a sweeping generalisation, as there may have been exceptions in some Ab- Popper (1957), for instance, has addressed a powerful argu- ment to historicism. What he calls historicism has strongly negative connotations as he identifies it mainly in terms of the endeavour to deduce from the study of social processes and history sweeping laws with which to predict the distant future. This is social prophecy which then has a tenden- cy to be self-fulfilling - a course which Popper believes historicism intrinsically means to pursue. Historicism in this sense comes close to a mythical conception which also assumes the existence of a predetermined course of events. The difference is of course that in the first instance the course is perceived as linear, at least usually so, and in the second cyclical or repetitive. Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="5">A Sense of History and the Reconstitution of Cosmology in Australian Aboriginal Society 53 original groups, in which a nascent sense of histor- ical process may have been awakened prior to the advent of Europeans. Worsley (1955: 860) calls Arnhem Land's Wanindiljaugwa (Anindilyakwa) "people with a history." They divide the past into the pre-Macassan Dreamtime, a Macassan period, and the present. It seems that it was the presence of these aliens, rather than their intellectual coach- ing, which has stimulated this Aboriginal group to revise the rigid conceptual views which prevail elsewhere in this society and introduce a third time dimension. However, it needs to be stressed again: this and perhaps a few other cases were rather the exception to the rule. In Aboriginal society, traditionally, the world was seen as unalterably determined in its major patterns and, quite logically, historical process and knowledge of it paled into total insignificance. The past was within the present and the future (Elkin 1969: 93). There was no room for variation, for development, for change - hence there was no need for history. This is not to say that nothing objectively ever changed. And some changes, as Stanner (1966: 148) has indicated, were indeed reflected in the medium of myth - as opposed to the constancy of ritual. But these changes, as much as their reflection in the oral tradition, were not recognised as what they were; and even if so, their significance would have had to be denied in the face of the overriding dogma of immutability. The content of the Dreamtime, objectively, was far from stable and unchanging, being constantly subject to revision through the incorporation of new experiences - as long as these could be ab- sorbed without causing a rupture of the traditional doctrines. Thus the constant redefinition of the Dreamtime in the past over probably thousands of years has woven a very complex mythical fab- ric, whose ingredients not surprisingly are not just ramified but also mutually contradictory and in- consistent. (The latest massive process of inclusion of new elements in myth, ritual, and totemism, at least in parts of Arnhem Land, was triggered by the experience with Macassans and their culture.) Thus the Dreamtime encompasses the accretions of millennia, conceptually telescoped into a compact time period and continuously added to. It seems fairly certain that it was not as immutable a body of oral traditions as the Aboriginal view of it was. Nor was it, as Partington (1985: 36) seems to think of it, a time-slice of an age of 40,000 years onto which after its completion only a very few select memories of impressive events, which had happened since, have become grafted. I follow anthropological convention in calling this dimension "Dreamtime." In my fieldwork ar- ea it is known as ngarranggani (ngarrangkarni), sometimes also as djugurrani or djugurrba: the time of divine exemplars sojourning on earth be- fore removing themselves above and below the surface of the world. In recent decades some events and conditions of the traditional or "human" past, which seem to lie back some time (ancient habitation sites or cave paintings) and which to us are history, have also become part of the di- mension of ngarranggani. In fact, even events of the first ethnic contact and even from early this century may have entered the Dreamtime dimen- sion, although because of mythical distortion one cannot be certain. In my experience, however, by and large the European past and the vast major- ity of post-contact changes, so far as Aborigines know them as changes, are usually emphatically excluded from the Dreamtime concept (see Kolig 1979a), as will be discussed later. One of the most salient criteria, in which myth differs from history, is the dimension of time. Con- ventionally, scholars distinguish between myth's sacred and reversible time, and history's profane and irreversible one (Eliade 1968: 23ff., Evans- Pritchard 1940: 108, Lévi-Strauss 1963: 209 and 1968: 270ff.). Sacred time, says Eliade, pertains to the timelessness of myth. Following Cassi- rer's argument, he maintains, that mythical thought arises from human awareness of their mortality and ephemerality, the inescapability of death. As humanity tries to counterbalance this harsh fact, it posits an eternal, sacred, unchanging dimension of time which may give human existence durability beyond individual fate. This contrasts with history and its sequence of singular, non-repetetive events. "Events in a story which have happened at a giv- en moment in its time-sequence are irretrievably located in the past. This is the nonreversible time to which students of history are accustomed. But there exists also another mode of thought about time, common to most religious conceptions. This is the time of eternal meanings; in this kind of time in Christian thought, for example, Christ can be in the world today. This is reversible time" (ten Raa 1971: 315). Although Cassirer's view implies that sacred time is a deliberate deception, a merciful self-de- lusion, it is irrelevant here which of the two time dimensions is fictitious and illusory, and which is not. The point is, they involve, at least implicitly, two fundamentally different kinds of concepts of social causality and attribute quite different value to actual events. Mythical thought perceives actual events and situations as significant only insofar as Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="6">54 Erich Kolig they enshrine cryptic, metaphysical meaning, or meaning may be gleaned through them. Events are predetermined and repetitive, hence the location of events in time is irrelevant. The phenomena of this world, insignificant in themselves, espouse aspects of an eternally fixed, firmly circumscribed reser- voir of divine, or transcendental, reasons. (His- torical events therefore can be arbitrarily selected for incorporation in myth, depending solely on what kind of meaning is believed that they reveal.) Historical thought, disinterested in events as pos- sible vessels of a priori existing meaning, ascribes significance to events themselves as they are seen to build on one another and to be determined, or influenced, by others either temporally antecedent or contextually simultaneous. Events as they are not reflective of eternal, immutable principles and meanings, thus are attributed with creativity, i.e., they bear within themselves the causes of future events. While in this view causality is open-ended, mythic thought draws on a closed, temporally highly flattened dimension of social causes. The reasons for social phenomena to come into exis- tence at any one time, have been unalterably laid down at one stage, in the beginning of time as it were. Ever since events unfold throughout history as merely eternal replica in accord with the a priori principles, laws, and reasons defined long ago. And it is because of this that events are reduced to trivial importance: they are but derivative and of interest only insofar as one might glimpse in them a shred of eternity or some divine will embodied in them. The Dreamtime, the traditional plane of Ab- original mythology, belongs to the past in the sense that it is believed to have really and truly happened at one stage. But while it is passé, it is not fini. Even though it consists of a series of singular happenings at some unspecified epoch in the past, its relevance lives on eternally: it is the Eternal Dreamtime, as some anthropologists have befittingly called it. While this above all refers to the dimension of time - a sacred dimension that extends from the past to the present and coexists with it - less mystically seen, it refers to social and cultural causality. What is happening now does not happen because of the whimsies of coincidence or the import of history; it happens because the Dreamtime has made it so and in the eyes of the believer it reflects the eternal workings of this powerful causal source. The Dreamtime does not span everything that belongs to the past. One might say, the Dream- time is the ancient past, or what is seen as such by the believer. The other aspect of the past, the accumulation of singular, unique events that have occurred and are occurring, is of no im- portance. What might happen today will be past tomorrow, but that does not make it important. It is ignored, prone to be forgotten soon, lost be- yond the contemporary horizon. The shallowness of this time perspective and the abruptness of its boundaries are borne out well by Australian kin- ship systems. They recognise terminologically two ascending and two descending generation levels, apart from the ego generation - beyond which lies only total nonexistence, as G. Barden (1969) has argued. The Aboriginal kinship systems, by and large, recognise only those generations that a person will actually know in his or her lifetime. Beyond that there is no interest in either posterity or descent; and genealogy means but a mythical link with a totemic ancestor who often is addressed as father's father, thus demonstrating how sharply, and unmitigatedly, the myth dimension borders contemporary life. The deceased person normally does not survive in memory for much beyond his death (there seem to be exceptions however), in a short time becoming totally and abruptly severed from the realm of the living. His belongings are burnt to remove all mementoes and his name is dropped from the vocabulary. If his name is con- tained in a myth verse, that word will be omitted or replaced by another one, or the whole verse will be eliminated from the myth cycle. What is being done in this way, is successively cutting out the recent past and restricting the time horizon to the relatively immediate present by shifting its focus continuously, so that, in Gellner's words (1964: 2), "the pattern of an eternal present and of its temporal horizon remains ever the same." Whatever is remembered as the past and of the past, has to be part of the Dreamtime. Historical events survive only if they happen to become in- corporated into the vision of the Dreamtime. This, as Sahlins (1985) has argued, is not an arbitrary process but is shaped by a "structure of signifi- cance" conveyed by a culture. And as they do, they may change this vision and alter the substance of the Dreamtime. Presumably, myth has always changed in accordance with the flow of history, without the latter ever losing its pretensions of smooth, immutable continuance reaching back in time to the Dreamtime. Thus history was defeated by being explained away, cheated out of its rightful impact by being absorbed into the myth body. As Pouwer (1975: 84) put it: "myth 'solves,' or rather circumvents the problem of history, by the very act of assimilating and incorporating it" and "myth seems to execute history by swallowing it." Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="7">A Sense of History and the Reconstitution of Cosmology in Australian Aboriginal Society 55 Actual events, observations, pieces of experi- ence have in the past always become part of myth, absorbed into its fabric and in the process losing its historical character and becoming the amorphous stuff from which true myth is made. Environmen- tal conditions, observations with flora and fauna, and the like may enter myth,4 memories of indi- vidual persons,5 tribal events of land exploration (Hoffman 1981), and the like. Not surprisingly, taking this into account, some anthropologists have tended, with justification, to stress Aboriginal myth as a kind of historical record.6 Whatever does not find entry into the body of myth or widely accepted narratives (legends), tends to be forgotten sooner or later. Both Sharp (1952: 70f.) and Stanner (1966: 139f.), for in- stance, remark on the fact that incisive historical 4 This view is propounded by Campbell (1967), but his argu- ment does not sound wholly convincing. It is unlikely that such processual events as rises in sea level (a view already expressed by Fison and Howitt 1967: 269), environmental and climatic changes become incorporated in myth, as he argues. They occur too slowly to be conscious to individual people without means of accurately recording conditions over long periods, and hence changes themselves cannot become conscious. Even indirectly the information about past conditions to be gleaned from myths is of dubious value. Even if a myth in a certain area, for instance, speaks quite unambiguously of a volcanic eruption, it does not follow that it records something that has actually happened in this area. The myth may have been diffused from a distant place and thus have little to say about past conditions in the place in which it is known. The same goes, of course, for mythical records of the existence of lakes in the interior of Australia or of the (shifting) shore lines of the ocean. They may refer to a totally different, distant area and very little can be inferred from them about the past of the area in which the myths are cultivated. 5 Bell (1983: 92ff.) shows how actually existing persons and their fate may come to enter the mythical repertory. In my fieldwork area I found that the reputation of one or two outstanding persons (such as famous maban, magicians and healers) had survived their deaths. They have entered local "folklore." Although their names are not used, their identi- ties, their deeds, and their burial sites (in one case a hollow tree) are well remembered and openly mentioned. Whether this has always been like this or is a recent phenomenon, an expression of the progressive historification discussed in this paper, is difficult to decide. If this phenomenon in essence is pre-European, it is quite conceivable that over time such memory - in the pre-European period - could have congealed into a myth. Whether this will still happen todav appears doubtful. 6 Among those Australianists who explicitly regard myths as records, if distorted ones, of the past is, above all, T. G. H. Strehlow (1971: 705f. and 1947: 6); but also J. Mathew (1899), A. Van Gennep (1906), A.W. Howitt (1904:482), and B. Spencer and F. Gillen (1899: 421f.) expressed sim- ilar ideas. On this issue see also Hiatt (1975: 3ff.) and Maddock (1988: 20f.). For a discussion of this type of view in a Polynesianist perspective see A. Howard (1985: 39ff.). events, or what appear to us as such, in the lives of Aborigines had not entered their oral traditions or been preserved in any way. Fateful encounters with Whites were totally forgotten a short time afterwards, shrugged from memory as insignifi- cant. Similarly, the redistribution of space among Aboriginal groups, for the people concerned must have been incisive events, well worth committing to memory one would think. But this was obvi- ously not so. The Gunwinggu, for instance, were relative latecomers to the area of residence when the Berndts were there. They had happily forged Dreamtime links with the new land apparently quite without reference to the fact of their hav- ing arrived lately (see Berndt and Berndt 1970). Likewise territorial shifts in the southern Kimber- leys, which had taken place only a few decades ago, I found to be totally unremembered (Kolig 1978: 56).7 That territorial reshuffle should leave no trace in memory only a few decades later, is not surprising as it went against Dreamtime dogma of territorial immutability and memory of it had to be ideologically suppressed to preserve the sanctity of dogma. But why ignore the encounter with strangers? The recognition of this occurrence could hardly have been seen to violate the dogma. Or could it have been seen as too insignificant to warrant preserving a memory of it in some form? Some groups did preserve recollections of encounters with Whites or Macassans, even though they may not accurately portray what actually happened.8 Melville Islanders, for instance, seem to have re- tained memories about earlier encounters with Por- tuguese slavers (cited by Partington 1985: 34). To put this into proper perspective: Aborigines are certainly not the only people with whom an actual event, which one would expect to have some 7 In this case, however, it may be that the event entered myth, though in such a veiled form as to make it impossible to be certain (see Kolig 1987: 64ff., 151). The conflict between two mythical beings, Marala-Marala and Danggaba, one advancing from the east, the other from the west, lends itself to the interpretation that it would refer to the historical struggle between two "tribal" groups, the Bunaba and the Nyigina, over land. But it equally well is amenable to other interpretations. 8 In this context a paper by R. Keesing (1986) deserves to be mentioned: it describes how, in 1963, he found among the Kwaio of the Solomon islands, memories as well as stylised epicised accounts (now chanted) of an historical event (the attack by Kwaio warriors on a schooner) which had happened in 1886 and entailed loss of life on both sides. - Distortions of historical events may occur unwittingly and randomly over time, but as often may occur as deliberate reinterpretations of the past so as to adjust collective mem- ory to ideological preconceptions (see Morphy 1984). Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="8">56 Erich Kolig considerable import, failed to make the anticipated impression. When Captain Cook in 1769 landed at Murderer's Bay in New Zealand, he found that the local Maori population had no trace of a memory of their tumultuous encounter with the crew of Dutch explorer Abel Janzoon Tasman some 130 years before. At that time four Dutchmen lost their lives in a skirmish, which prompted Tasman to name the place Moordenaer's Bay. One should think that this encounter, for the local Maori their first with Europeans, and strange and frighten- ing for both sides as it must have been, should have been sufficiently impressive to condense into some form of oral tradition. Apparently, however, nothing of the sort happened. It seems obvious that Western historiographie standards of what is important and what is not are hardly a universal benchmark. One cannot justifiably deduce from that that Aborigines traditionally lived in and for the mo- ment only. Rather what I mean is that there was a tendency to see personal experiences and indi- vidual events as of little importance, hardly worth preserving. Such events may be of import to an individual, but not to society. Characteristically, I have never heard elderly, extremely traditionally orientated Aborigines draw much on somebody else's experience. A person might rely during his lifetime on his own accumulated stock of expe- rience and store it deliberately in his mind as a source of pragmatic wisdom. But socially this is of no concern. Within the framework of Aboriginal episte- mology there is no need for individually accrued memory; wisdom is not seen as individually uni- que. Indeed significant improvement of knowledge through individual experience is held to be impos- sible, for human knowledge exists a priori, inde- pendently of individuals (Kolig 1973/74: 270ff.). All cognitive possibilities are predetermined by the Dreamtime which has left no condition, or phenomenon, physical or metaphysical, real or transcendental, in principle unknown to man. In any event, refinement of knowledge would be su- perfluous as the blueprint of human existence is unalterably pre-given. The total immutability of the world obviates very effectively the need for adaptive cognitive improvement to deal with real- ity successfully. The mythical thinker has a rigid perspective of himself and his abilities. He is the vessel of prede- termined meaning, not a "creator" himself. There is a parallel to an argument Mannheim put forward with regard to two different types of person. Mann- heim (1952: 25 If.) argued that the unambitious person, enwrapped in monotonous drudgery, ex- periences time as "discontinuous," i.e., the flow of time is seen by him as incoherent and spasmodic. It is unstructured by goals and personal achievement, or by phases of meaningful personal growth and the like. Taking a cue from Leach (1961: 132ff.) and Durkheimian sociology, this can be applied metonymically to the mythical thinker to whom his personal existence must appear amorphous, un- punctuated by highlights and dwarfed into cosmo- logical insignificance as it is. In need of ordering time somehow, he uses activity relating to the sa- cred dimension (ritual) to arrive at a time structure and meaningfulness of his existence. The historical thinker whose existence is not overshadowed by a mythic preeminence, is in a different position. His experience is segmented by the fact that events occur in his life which in themselves are seen as important and meaningful and therefore help him to demarcate intervals. Traditional Aboriginal cosmology is Platonic par excellence inasmuch as the implied social cau- sality is projected completely into the concept of the primordial Dreamtime where it becomes one with natural causality. Society and culture in their traditional form are as much the products of the intervention of Dreamtime powers as the shapes of the land, nature, and natural features. Through the Dreamtime a dimension of social causality is posited that is temporally extremely flattened despite hints of an inner chronological structure. This internal chronology is a highly relative one and consists in placing - occasionally only and not as a matter of rule - wanderings of some cul- ture heroes in temporal relation to those of others, without however insisting on detailed exactness. The vague placement of some Dreamtime events as "before" and "after" in relation to one another, does not detract from the fact that chronology is unimportant: it does not really matter which myth being had visited a certain location earlier than another one. It does also not detract from the fact that the Dreamtime concept provides one compact parcel of social causality that contrasts with the "ever-after." Everything after the Dreamtime is causally derivative: human existence unfolds in strict accordance with the laws and principles laid down by the Dreamtime, regardless of how much time since the conclusion of creation has gone by and how many generations have passed. I have mentioned several times social causality as contained, or more precisely implied, in myth. The intended emphasis lies on implied. Aetiology in myth I hold to be an accidental feature. It is not the primary intent, or function, of myths to provide Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="9">A Sense of History and the Reconstitution of Cosmology in Australian Aboriginal Society 57 reasons why phenomena of the real world exist. Myths are not explanatory statements on origins and reasons of social patterns or institutions - quasi "precritical" theories that seek to explain the real world and things that exist in it (cf. Popper 1972: 347). Most myths are only incidental to the question of origin and none treats it in a systematic fashion - as again Stanner (1966: 14) in his usual perceptiveness has noted. The reason for myths to draw on social constellations and conditions is because these are somehow seen to be apo- dictical evidence for transcendental assumptions and to be revelatory of divine intent. In selecting their evidence as it were, myths proceed highly eclectically, i.e., they are not referring to all so- cial conditions, but select some and ignore others. (Naturally, there is a tendency to include those that are seen to be more important than others.) Mythical eclecticism would be curious and unin- telligible if the myths' purpose were to provide reasoned aetiological explanations. Aboriginal mythology bears out the point quite well that mythical thought is unconcerned with true beginnings in a causative sense. On the most fundamental level the lack of aetiological interest is clearly expressed by the striking absence of a belief in a creatio ex nihilo. The speculation on how the world basically had come into existence is obviously considered totally irrelevant. More- over, the myths in referring to cultural and social phenomena, inventions of techniques, and special skills never relate how they were developed, dis- covered, or accumulated. Speculations on the true reasons for the appearance of these phenomena are circumvented, as they always appear ready-made being introduced from somewhere outside the eth- nocentre. The problem writ large in myth is the induction of these phenomena into the ethnocentre, but not how they causally came about. 2. Social Causation Revised In Aboriginal society the rapidity and profundity of social and cultural change following the devastat- ing advent of Whites opened up huge discrepancies between social reality and the traditional ideology centred around stability and immutability. A crisis in "the world-taken-for-granted" (Schutz 1964 and 1967: 231), a shock to the customary interpretation of reality ensued, entailing the need for a revision of traditional assumptions. It was perhaps less the appearance of Whites themselves which shattered the traditional worldview - this could always be interpreted within the traditional framework of as- sumptions (see Kolig 1972) or could be ignored as the absence of mythical records of many first encounters show. It was the obvious cataclysm that befell Aboriginal society itself which enforced a rethinking of traditional (i.e., pre-European) as- sumptions. Of course this harks back to a very fundamental question: to what extent does an external reality have a direct influence on man's apprehension and conception of it? As Aborigines have shown, a vastly changed social reality can for some con- siderable time be comprehended and acted upon in a relatively meaningful way, with a traditional, i.e., largely unchanged, cognitive instrumentary. Or more relevant to our theme, the question sure- ly must be: as people get increasingly uncertain whether social constellations are still in accord with traditional meaning and whether divine pur- pose is still revealed in the way they live - ex- actly when do they reach the breaking point, the irrefutible crisis, when their traditional convictions become so critically weakened that they begin to look for reasons of their existence outside tradi- tional cosmological assumptions? Borsboom in his study of the Maradjiri ritual complex (1978) argues that even when the Western impact entails significant changes in myth and ritu- al, they manage to preserve the facade of unbroken continuity with the past. In other words, changes become absorbed and defused without altering or significantly deforming, let alone destroying, tradi- tional assumptions. This may work for some time. However, one suspects that such cases as the Ma- radjiri remain as ideologically deliberate enclaves, preserves maintained by Aborigines knowingly as a consciously kept link with the past. But by and large, especially when the impact of history is sustained to a high degree of intensity, myth and rite do have to change too along with the world- view in which they are embedded. Real changes cannot for ever be explained away behind a smooth facade of mythic immutability. Adjustments will have to be made. This is I believe what happened in Aboriginal society in the Kimberleys, as can be shown reflected in oral traditions. In the mythical view the world is taken for granted and not in need of causal explanations. I think it is one of the major defining criteria sepa- rating myth from history that in the former causal reasons are only implicit whereas the latter is ex- plicitly and specifically concerned with them. The aspect of causality, present in myth but cryptically and implicitly, and lacking in explanatory intent, has been developed and ultimately hypostatised in history consciousness. The interest in social causes Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="10">58 Erich Kolig that informs the latter develops in a situation of insecurity - insecurity about whether the existing shapes, modes of existence and phenomena of the world do or do not reveal divine intent and pur- pose. This is the beginning of a critical, probing, eternally sceptical form of awareness. As Aboriginal man in the crisis of social cata- clysm turns to his myths to provide him with a set of causal reasons and reassurance, he may realise that they fail him in two respects - and this is the first step towards breaking the myths' para- mount dominance and their becoming transcended by history consciousness: one is that the myths do not relate at all to the circumstances of a social reality which has changed so much as to make their shortcoming glaringly obvious; and the other is the fundamental absence of causal intent in them which only then, as man searchingly probes his myths for reasons, becomes fully obvious to him. Aborigines, traditionally, have created two sharply contrasting dimensions relating to time and existential qualities: the sacred past, the dimension of eternal, immutable meaning; and a non-sacred present which has its roots in the sacred past but as such has neither duration nor import beyond the moment and beyond individual concern. The two realms border each other uncushioned, harshly, yet never merge. There is no intermediary dimension such as the Nuer have: a historical span, brief as it may be, that stands in between the mythical past and the present (Evans-Pritchard 1940: 108). Even though it is only about a hundred years old, filled by tradition and beyond which "lies the horizon of pure myth which is always seen in the same time perspective" (ibid.), this provides a mediatory dimension. It recognises, albeit to a very limited extent, the causal relevance of history. Similar provisions were once made by an earlier Christian tenet which assumed the post-creation world to be about six millennia old. Brief as this historical period following God's creation may be, it sufficed as an explanation why the world obviously no longer conformed to divine order and had strayed from the right path. In other words, a dimension had been introduced which could accommodate reasons why humanity no longer lived in accord with mythical, paradisical precedent. Aborigines traditionally have nothing of this kind: a dimension through which might be ex- plained what is relevant and obvious now, yet which does not belong to the sacred Dreamtime and cannot be rationalised through it.9 The binary character of traditional Aboriginal cosmology - a condition which Gellner (1971: 160) has termed "discontinuous" - must lead to unsurmountable logical difficulties when it comes to grasping ex- tensive social and cultural change. As much as one can surmise innovations, which Aboriginal society inevitably must have faced be- fore the advent of Whites, fell into two cate- gories: those acceptable were incorporated into the Dreamtime dimension, while others, consid- ered unacceptable were ignored, suppressed, and quickly forgotten. Post-hoc incorporation into the Dreamtime was not, of course, a conscious delib- erate manoeuvre - if so Aborigines would hard- ly have been better than charlatans and religious opportunists fooling themselves all along. Adapta- tions were not made by spontaneous amendments to the sacred Dreamtime as the need arose, but by a gradual reinterpretation, a perhaps often pained search for exegetical points of reference in that body of wisdom thought to have come to man unchanged from the Dreamtime. Acceptable in- novations did in actual fact not appear as such, but when they arose seemed already to be part of the Dreamtime. Thus the ideology of immutabili- ty, which held that everything of importance that happens is part of the Dreamtime concept, could remain undisturbed. Aborigines along the northern coasts had in the past been exposed to various external cultural influences, prior to the appearance of Whites. In their encounters with such peoples as Macassans, Indonesian sea-farers and fishermen, and perhaps Melanesians, these Aborigines had ostensibly re- tained the upper hand, remaining completely in control of the contact situation, successfully stem- ming any massive cultural intrusion. Whatever was allowed to trickle through to their aware- ness, seems to have been perceived by Aborigines as of little consequence and was quickly struck from their world perception. Other foreign ele- ments, as the mythology, ritual, and some so- cial patterns of northern coastal Aborigines show, have been selectively accepted and incorporated into the Dreamtime design. The problem, howev- er, became acute with the arrival of Whites and the wide-ranging cataclysmic changes that ensued. The results of this contact determine the exis- tence of Aborigines today, as they are well aware. Traditionally, sociocultural patterns of the present should be linked to the Dreamtime, but doing so 9 As mentioned before, Worsley's Wanindiljaugwa may have been an exception (Worsley 1955: 860). Probably impressed by the cultural presence of the Macassans which could not easily be accommodated in the concept of the Dreamtime, they appear to have developed an intermediary category. Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="11">A Sense of History and the Reconstitution of Cosmology in Australian Aboriginal Society 59 and rationalising changed conditions now in terms of sacred precedents would mean giving religious blessing and cosmological approval to White en- croachment. Doing so would mean granting the status of sacrality to the social and cultural domi- nance of Whites and this would be tantamount to surrendering to them not only whatever may be left of Aboriginal lore, law, and belief, but the very essence of the sacred Dreamtime which Whites seem bent on destroying. A few Western elements though have found their way into the Dreamtime concept and are accepted today by Aborigines as an integral part of a traditional life style. Holding most rituals nowadays during the monsoon season, for instance, is seen by Aborigines as essentially traditional, although objectively this is a conces- sion to the employment pattern introduced by the pastoral industry. (Pastoral work all but ceases dur- ing the rain season allowing Aborigines extended periods in which to concentrate on ritual duties; see Kolig 1981: 51ff.) The other option that Aborig- ines in previous ethnic encounters may have had - to ignore the capacity of aliens to induce profound changes in Aboriginal society - is hardly feasible under present circumstances. It is impossible to turn a blind eye to the incursion of Western civ- ilisation and the numerous fundamental changes that have affected Aboriginal life over the past decades. Nor can these changes be accommodated in an updated vision of the Dreamtime, stretched to its limits of flexibility as it may be. Characteristically during my fieldwork I ob- served a process taking place among Aborigines by which they moved away from a purely myth- ic, a-prioristic conception of social reality to an awareness of historical causality which was seen to work itself out in ever new combinations of events whose meaning, essence, and causes are neither predetermined nor wholly predictable. Causes for events and phenomena turning up in the relative recent past and the present were increasingly lo- cated outside the Dreamtime. 3. New and Revised Oral Traditions One major feature I observed in the transition of worldviews, was the historification of existing mythology. The myths were now often said to be authentic history insofar as they were held to relate to the wanderings of primordial Aboriginal tribes across the continent, their search for hunting grounds, encounter with other groups, and the like. The myths in other words, in this perspective, were the records of the exploits of Aboriginal pioneers, claiming and occupying the then virgin land and instituting customs and patterns of sur- vival through trial and error. The animal compo- nent of those culture heroes, the myths' totemic ingredient, was deliberately played down and the supposed anthropomorphism of these mythic be- ings emphasised instead. Some mythic traditions, in which the animal character of the protagonists was still prevalent, were often termed "legends" now, presumably to stress their fictitiousness and to distinguish them from true history. Some Aboriginal "philosophers" offered new interpretations which structured the Dreamtime now in a primordial, basic creative epoch in which animal-like creatures such as the sacred Rainbow Serpent had roamed the earth, and a later, historical era of man. (This is consistent with observations made by Petri in La Grange; Petri 1965.) I think it would be too simplistic to understand this reinterpretation of traditional mythology as in- tellectual tokenism: a concession to Western ideol- ogy, an attempt to appease Western scepticism and to avoid ridicule. The process is more serious than that. By humanising myth, the new interpretation places Aboriginal man in the cultural focus and attributes to him creativity - something he did not possess in the traditional cosmology. Now histor- ical men, not divine powers, are being credited with feats of cultural and social achievements of causal relevance. To make the "apotheosis" of man complete, human creation becomes in principle repeatable. Social action, human activity now as in the past is creative, not just imitative and endlessly repetitive. This unmistakably adds a new fluidity and open-endedness to social existence. Another important factor was the creation of new myths in the past few decades; myths which follow the structure of traditional mythology, and were accompanied by ritual, but impart quite a new message. These new myths, and mythemes, are not designed to convey Dreamtime meaning and update it by including surreptitiously features of modernity - which would extend and corrobo- rate the claim of the Dreamtime for everlasting, undiminished relevance. They are not to gloss over the inability of the Dreamtime to account for and explain new conditions, experiences, and relevances. On the contrary, they demonstrate that this very claim has been superceded. Such myths do not add to the "transmission redundancy" of traditional material, but proffer new insights which deviate distinctly from the traditional truths con- tained in the Dreamtime concept. Thus a new set of meaning, this time of post-contact provenance, is introduced and propagated. Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="12">60 Erich Kolig Kurrangarra, in vogue in the North- Western Kimberleys in the 1930s, was such an attempt to bring new realities within a revised religious scheme of the world (see Lommel 1950 and 1952, Pétri 1950û, 1950ft, 1954, among others). Another such modern myth of the same genre, which in the 1970s had come to enjoy enormous popularity in the Southern Kimberleys, and which I have recorded (Kolig 1979ft and 1989: 85ff., 122f.), belongs to the cult of Djulurru. It draws on an array of post-contact phenomena and experiences: guns, bombs, time, aeroplanes, cars and camels, ships and ship wrecks, it even includes the names "German" and "Hitler."10 Sometimes traditional myths are placed in an updated ideological framework which validates pre-contact myth now in terms of new ideologies. This happened with Worgaia in the Eighty Mile Beach area: a traditional cult which presented itself in the 1960s associated with Christian eschatology, chiliasm, and Marxist class-struggle - to name only the most salient ideological ingredients (see Petri and Petri-Odermann 1964, 1968, and 1970). Another recent myth creation centres around Captain Cook who features as a negative cul- ture hero. His mythical presence falls outside the Dreamtime, yet it is conceded that it has decisively shaped the present existence of Aborigines (see Kolig 1979a). Without doubt the purpose of this myth is to place reasons for the contemporary conditions outside the Dreamtime.11 The myths of Cook, Djulurru, Worgaia, and Kurrangarra clearly contain, or contained, actual events of post-contact history, thus acknowledging nontraditional phenomena, things, and experiences as highly relevant to contemporary Aboriginal existence. Despite their being still unmistakably myths in character and style, these episodes con- stitute a significant innovation: they do not only place reasons for current phenomena outside the Dreamtime, but totally contradict the traditional concept by pointing up social conditions which are in utter disaccord with mythical precedent. One might say, these myths represent Aboriginal man's endeavour to check his current existence whether it still conforms somehow with the mythic precepts 10 B. Glowczewski (1983) has described Djulurru from a Central Australian perspective and not surprisingly there are major differences between her and my portrayal of the cult. Several more anthropologists have observed the cult in Central Australia, though the published record remains thin. 11 D. Rose (1984), in a recent paper, has discussed the image of Captain Cook in the East Kimberleys and K. Maddock (1988) has done so in Australia-wide terms. of the Dreamtime, spurred as he is by the sus- picion that it does not. Apart from their being an expression of scepticism and actively undermining the dominance of the Dreamtime idea, the new myths have another effect. The past, although still seen with a somewhat mythical flavour, stretched and extended to assume perceptibly greater depth. By interposing a new dimension the shallow, con- temporary momentarity no longer faces an equally shallow and harshly delineated sacred past. Thus the present and the past are capable of being per- ceived more in terms of an unbroken - and at least potentially ongoing - continuum, both time-wise and as to their causal qualities. A much wider time span is credited with social causality and it tends to merge now with the present. The new myths also demonstrate another point. The relative temporal position of events, related in the myths, is apparently of greater significance than before. Traditional myth is unconcerned about chronology: myth events may happen before or after other similar ones. Either way it will not make any difference to the cosmological unfolding of the Dreamtime. Modification of land features by myth beings and cultural achievements, say, the introduction of circumcision are coterminous. The latter does not depend on the former having been completed earlier. If there is a connection between them it is purely coincidental, not logic or causal. This is quite unlike more recent interpretations of the Dreamtime in which a basic creation ordering nature antedates the epoch of human exploits; and is even more strongly expressed in new myths. I am not saying the new myths show now a distinct inner chronology. In fact they do not. In particular the Djulurru myth offers a potpourri of historical impressions which are chronologically completely unordered: bombs of World War 2 are juxtaposed with a ship sinking in 1910, etc. The kaleidoscopic vision offered comes about through the essentially still mythic character of the story that relies on an eclectic selection of events and phenomena which serve as vehicles of meaning. Bits are arbitrarily selected, broken up and rearranged, prized from their original historic context and reassembled in a mythic fabric whose threads may be historical, but whose composite texture is not. What is important in the new myths is a larger scale chronology that stresses the temporal relationship of Dreamtime events and extra-Dreamtime events. Especially the Cook myth is quite explicit about it. The thrust of the myth relies entirely on the events to be seen in their proper sequence. It draws on a meaning- ful progression from the Dreamtime to traditional Aboriginal life as it was in the pre-contact era Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="13">A Sense of History and the Reconstitution of Cosmology in Australian Aboriginal Society 61 until Cook's appearance, which at the same time is the White equivalent of the Dreamtime, and then on to the contemporary era. An obscuration, or worse, a reversal, of the sequence would ut- terly destroy the myth's message which stresses the relative position to each other of Aboriginal and White Dreamtime attributing greater age and hence importance to the Aboriginal one. I take this to indicate a growing recognition of the causal faculty of chronology. In other words, the reason for placing events strictly chronologically and not string them together arbitrarily, must spring from an at least dimly perceived sense of the causal interconnectedness between discrete events. All these phenomena I have discussed are char- acteristic of a transformation from a static view of the social universe toward a processual, dynamic one in which the creative sacred past is no longer insurmountably divided from an endlessly repeti- tive, causally insignificant present (and mundane, recent past of course). The a-prioristic, causative period is gradually being shaped into an open- ended, continuing process in which human expe- rience is accorded the possibility, if not necessity, to make a contribution. There are of course other, perhaps even more impressive indicators of the transformation - indicators which seem to demon- strate how far advanced the process is. Numerous oral traditions other than formalised song-cycle myths have appeared, beginning to take note of many recent historical events: there is now a pleth- ora of stories about the rebel Pigeon, who had terrorised the people of the area in the last years of the^ previous century, the first encounters with Afghans and Whites, stories about massacres in the early days of colonisation, and the like. (See Kolig 1987: 18ff.; Muecke, Rumsey, and Wirrunmarra 1985.) These stories do not strive towards total historical accuracy, as this is not their purpose. Nonetheless, they are significant as indicators of a rising history consciousness. Such myths or stories may often turn out to be quite at variance with a reasonable probability of what has actually happened or with recorded data. The Ngalakan too have distorted their perceptions of the past for reasons which may lie in past or present social relationships (see Morphy 1984). In their case they wished to harmonise their relation- ship with Whites. Oral traditions in the Kimber- leys, in my experience, are shaped by the opposite desire: to express antagonism to White society. Cook is presented as a land-grabbing archvillain, while the "rebel" Pigeon, who had threatened the authority of the Whites, is made a hero. There are also, surprisingly, faint pro-German notions inso- far as Germans were sometimes said to have pre- ceded Anglo- Australians in the areas and to have treated Aborigines well. These sentiments are only explicable, for lack of an apparent foundation in historical truth, as an expression of anti- Australian, i.e., Anglo-Saxon, feelings.12 Again, any such generalisation is riddled with exceptions. Whites may in stories be singled out as kind, fair, or supportive of Aborigines. Curiously, sometimes affection of this kind is even shown for Whites who are otherwise portrayed in these stories as hard and brutal. However, these are more or less individual perceptions tinged with personal nostalgia and referring to individual Whites, while the image of White society per se was predom- inantly negative. Selective and distorted percep- tions of what has gone before, as glaringly obvious attempts to reinterpret one's past so as to make it more palatable, are a universal phenomenon, intruding even on modern historiography, espe- cially in times of political crisis and wars. In my fieldwork in Afghanistan, in 1968, 1 encountered a blatant case of reinterpreting the past so as to make it acceptable to the present - a present dominated by Islam. The Pashai in the foothills of the Hindu- kush, as good Muslims rejecting alcoholic drinks, are not too happy about the huge vats which hewn from grown rock dot the area and which had been used by the local population for wine-making before they had been converted to Islam in the 19th century. They now simply ascribed them to another population with whom they felt they had nothing in common. Burial chambers also carved from the rock and which remain from pre-Islamic burial customs were attributed to "giants" who were said to have scratched them from the rock, when it was still soft, with their finger nails. As the Ngalakan wished to underline their good rapport with Whites by adding some gross misconceptions to their oral traditions, so the Pashai had to deny certain aspects of their past in order to stress their being devout - and teetotalling - Muslims. A distinction has to be made between indi- vidual memory, oral tradition (collective memory relating to past events as well as "myth-like" but unstructured stories such as children's legends), and proper myth (which in the Aboriginal cultural context is a fixed text in verse form which is sung). The relationship between the three may in many 12 It is of course possible that in some cases such sentiments, when expressed, may have been meant as complimentary to the author of whom it was widely known that his first language is German and this may have led to the erroneous belief that he were in fact German. Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="14">62 Erich Kolig cases have assumed the form of a developmental sequence: individual memory becomes forged into collective and formalised stories, their prose then eventually becoming shaped into myths in verse form. Traditionally, while individual memory may not have had to conform with the Dreamtime dogma, certainly collective memory, if it was to be widely acknowledged as valid, had to do so; and most certainly myth was bound to be in accord with the Dreamtime dogma. In the past there was little need for a wealth of such informal, memory-based stories, as the important things were supposed to be contained in the "official" mythology of the Dreamtime. Now- adays, there is not only a proliferation of such stories both individual and collective memories, but also they no longer have to be tuned to the Dreamtime dogma - in fact, they thrive on go- ing beyond the Dreamtime and acknowledge the relevances of the recent past and the upheavals it brought. The traditional memory culture is beginning to rely more and more, and with increasing fre- quency and regularity, on individual memory, the experience the old generation and the generation before that have made - both of which fall into the period of the initial culture contact in many parts of the Kimberleys. A body of recollections of police atrocities, clashes with early settlers, the traumatic change from bush life to a life in settlements, is being formulated and handed on as part of an oral tradition (though not actually couched in the tradi- tional form of myth). But this is more than just a collection of intriguing memories. Over and above its serving as a static basis of comparison between the present and the past - to assess changes, mea- sure possible improvement or lack of it - this body of observational data forms a vital link in causal chains that are seen, now increasingly clearly, to extend from the past into the present. Before I proceed to discuss the political con- sequences of the new historical perception, I will outline very briefly what I consider the solutions were for those, mostly younger generations who had imbibed a history-consciousness through their schooling and were faced with the challenge to synchronise it with the religious view imparted to them by religious initiation. For various reasons, the doctrines of the Dreamtime (whether in ortho- dox or already adjusted form) could not be brushed aside as irrelevant. In fact, they do have become invigorated and form now an integral and essen- tial ingredient of Aboriginality (see Kolig 1994). On the other hand, for equally plausible reasons school-learning could not be simply set aside, even though many youngsters were unwilling recipients of it. But Western "indoctrination" and its effects could not be denied. While I made no systematic attempt by way of questionnaire or through structured interview, to elicit relevant views, I constantly came across three basic themes which in themselves revealed an attempt to achieve some form of synchronisa- tion and harmonisation of the two paradigmatic views. Characteristically this was done by way of reinterpreting the Dreamtime tenet in line with ed- ucationally mediated views rather than vice versa, thus demonstrating the latter' s relative power and dominance. One theme was - and this seemed to me to be the predominant one - to revise myths by hu- manising their character and downplaying the "to- temic" (i.e., animal and plant) component. Those myths in which the totemic aspect was still strong were often labelled legends and obviously taken less seriously. Their veracity was seen somehow impaired, fit for children only. (This is the kind of revision mentioned earlier.) The second theme was an obviously missionary-Christian inspired in- terpretation viewing Dreamtime characters as spir- itual entities, agents of partial creation, associated with and acting under the directives by God. And the third, finally, was perhaps least consistent and inspired, though rather flamboyant. It was what I might call the "dinosaur option." It provided an explanatory linkage between Dreamtime charac- ters and the school information about dinosaurs as ancient, enormously big and powerful creatures which once upon a time had roamed the earth. The notion of the dawn of time (or an early phase of the earth's past) as well as the lumbering, huge proportions of these animals, their incredible powers when compared with any living creature, made them evidently suitable explanatory models for the Dreamtime and the beings by which it was inhabited. By implication veracity was conceded to the Dreamtime - as quasi an ancient record or recollection or prescientific reconstruction of what had once existed according to scientific wisdom. The Dreamtime was vindicated through scientific proof; it had turned out to be truthful and correct, its dignity and veracity upheld and confirmed. But the very constellation between the traditional Ab- original view of the past and science / a European sense of the past showed again the ideological dominance of the latter over the former.

The Politics of History Myths of course have always had political im- plications, in Aboriginal society as much as in any other - this needs no belabouring. Writing on this question recently, Sutton (1988) for instance holds that myth has relevance only insofar and so long as it bears on the present, tenuous as the link may be, and on the interests of living people. Here this political nexus is clearly addressed. Such interests may be the distribution and acquisition of land or rights of usage, religious supremacy and prestige, legitimation of the status quo or its overthrow, and the like. On a more intellectual plane, such interest may be to arrive at a con- ceptual model of relationships with other people and to take this understanding as a take-off point for change. Maddock's analysis of the myth of Captain Cook (1988) clearly brings out this point. By adapting this historical figure to a mythical horizon, he argues, Aborigines express their views about the kind of relationships they think they have with Europeans. The myths, Maddock says, reflect the Aborigines' sense of a lack of reciprocity and balance of relationship with White society, but as a political system of thought they also envisage an alternative to the perceived current state of affairs. Historification bears a distinct resemblance with myth in this respect. Given that not all that has happened in the past becomes history, but rather a selection only, recognised history has always a measure of relevance to the present. That is why it has been selected and becomes recognised as such. And a good deal of that has discernible political implications. Not surprisingly, the Aboriginal ap- preciation of history (or in some cases historicised mythopoesis) too nowadays has political functions and intentions. I shall attempt to give a summary description here. Of course, the development of a totally Aborig- inal history, completely unfettered by European historiography, is hampered to some considerable extent. One of the problems lies already in lan- guage. Aboriginal attempts to preserve their own languages and to assimilate standard English go only some way. Aborigines must of necessity now use this (foreign) language not only to enter a discourse with the wider society &gt; and extract in- formation, but also to develop a discourse among themselves of a kind that is mutually intelligible to them. These linguistic tools by way of metaphors, similes, and concepts, etc., are themselves trans- formative, altering the objects of description. Ad- ditionally, Aboriginal researchers in constructing an Aboriginal viewpoint of history have to con- sult a European-compiled and -controlled archival body of information to extend and supplement the range of oral traditions. Thus the autonomy of the Aboriginal historical perspective is seriously hampered.13 However, the outcome still deviates markedly in some respects from entrenched West- ern views, which is not unpredictable, when for instance the "outcast" Pigeon, long castigated as villain in Australian history books, is portrayed as a hero and freedom fighter. Colin Johnson's "Long Live Sandawara" (1979) (see Shoemaker 1989) is a long shot from Ion Idriess' "Outlaw of the Leopolds" (1952).14 The decisive factor in such transformatory exer- cises is ideology - or myth which can be equated in function. As Roland Barthes (1973: 143) ar- gued, myth allows history to be seen in quite dif- ferent ways and perspectives. What Barthes calls myth (but equally justifiably may be called ideolo- gy) subtly changes the perspective and transforms "history into nature" by giving experiences of, and information about, the past obvious, unalterable connotations, giving them a clarity and eternal justification which makes them into "facts," thus enabling "the informed" to detect "the truth" in history by having made its processes transparent. 13 Beckett (1993) analyses a particularly interesting case of an Aboriginal man's endeavour to construct what turns out to be a rather idiosyncratic "history of the world" or at least "of Australia." This narrative apparently recorded by Beckett in New South Wales in the 1950s (?), shows several features discussed in this article: the synthetisation of Ab- original myth with Christianity and post-contact historical perspectives, the development of an inner chronology of myth events (which was apparently unique at the time and quite characteristic for this person while others resisted this idea), the construction of a specific, albeit embryonic, "Aboriginal history," and the chronologisation of myth and history. But perhaps this attempt by one thoughtful man was ahead of his time, since, as it is said in the article, it was "abortive" (675); in the sense that it was not accepted by other Aborigines (i.e., it failed to be widely seen as enshrining the truth). 14 It remains to be seen if Australia will experience the cre- ation of an "Aboriginal science," as is the case in New Zealand where there are moves afoot to place "Maori sci- ence" alongside "Western science" in the school curriculum, giving pupils and parents a choice. This means conceding to "Maori science" the same respectability as "Western science" enjoys. In fact "Maori science" is "matauranga," a traditional (i.e., pre-European with some modern adapta- tions) body of knowledge and information about the world, which is received, hallowed by tradition and contains myth- ical and religious ingredients. As is in the nature of such forms of knowledge they are doctrinal and axiomatic and thus contradict the spirit of "science" in the sense of lacking openness, flux, and the possibility of ongoing criticism - features which are constitutive of "science." Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="16">64 Erich Kolig First and foremost, the historification of social causality, as discussed before, entails major po- litical consequences. Nowadays, political thought pivots on that more often than it does on an or- thodox notion of the Dreamtime dogma, and is articulated in terms of the historicity of relation- ships between Aborigines and the wider society. Aboriginal ambitions and aspirations are relating to historical events and conditions, either directly or in general terms. Be they economic or legal improvements, the measure is derived from histor- ical events which have brought about the current unsatisfactory or denigrating conditions. Perhaps the most conspicuous application lies in the no- tion of primacy of occupation of Australia and the rights flowing from original, almost primal, ownership. Aborigines clearly and unambiguously see themselves as original owners/occupants not just in a legalistic sense, but in a sense of historical relationship with Europeans. This clearly draws, first and foremost, on a (relative) chronology and a notion of historical depth of ownership and occu- pation. Even beyond relative chronology, it draws on a historicist notion of the time spans involved: viz., the enormous time span of Aboriginal occupa- tion vis-à-vis the puny depth of European presence and the relative rights and privileges which are flowing, or rather should be flowing, from this dif- ference in accordance with a perception of "natural justice." The recomposition of the self in terms of orig- inal owners and occupants of the land harks back to the same theme. Europeans and others are per- ceived by Aborigines as "late-comers," who can hardly lay claim to any depth of their presence, while Aborigines are able to muster a dimension of thousands of years to derive from it, and fortify, their identity. The dignity which Aborigines seek and is now hesitantly granted by the wider society, is not just history-based insofar as it rests on the perceived duration of occupation, but relies also on a perception of the length of survival in a difficult environment and above all, the age of Aboriginal culture. The latter point, regrettably, often involves a misconception about its total immutability. (Im- mutability is of course the best guarantor for con- tinuity and historical identity, While recognition of change would bring awkward difficulties in deter- mining the "true" age of the present culture and delineating it against previous, different ones. The recognition of fundamental cultural differences be- tween Aboriginal culture as it was when Europeans arrived and as it was many thousands of years ago, could conceivably lead to a lack of credibility for some of the claims being made - especially if post-contact changes would be taken into account and perceived in terms of a "natural" process of transformation in a culture of continuing vitality.) Aborigines accepting in a sense the epithet "stone age people," metamorphose it into an honorific title even though it reflects outdated evolution- ary notions and unflattering connotations. Such unfashionable and outdated evolutionary notions, which held that time across the whole breadth of Australian phenomena and for the whole continent has stood still preserving eveything in an ancient condition and thus relegating Aborigines to living relics, are summed up well in these words by Sir James Frazer: "many a quaint old-fashioned crea- ture, many an antediluvian oddity, which would long ago have been rudely elbowed and hustled out of existence in more progressive countries, has been suffered to jog quietly along in this preserve of Nature's own, this peaceful garden, where the hand on the dial of time seems to move more slowly than in the noisy bustling world outside" (1965). Although such sentiments once contained rather uncomplementary implications, they change subtly but perceptibly now. The concept of Aboriginal "ancestry" too is often enunciated now in a political context, draw- ing on the notion of cultural continuity stretching back in time to the beginning 50 millennia or so ago. Traditionally (i.e., in the sense of pre- contact knowledge), there was as little interest in human descent or kinship with generations past, as there was in human remains after they had been ritually disposed of. The only interest was in Dreamtime ancestry. And this relatedness was conceived as bordering sharply on contemporary kinship. Intervening generations had no relevance and commanded no interest, in fact conceptually did not exist. Now the concept of human ancestry encompasses the newly detected time dimensions kindling, among other things, a fervent interest in human remains recovered meanwhile by archaeo- logical science, some of these remains being many thousands of years old. (The Kow Swamp remains are about 15,000 years old, the Lake Mungo re- mains even older.) In their case it would be very difficult to argue reasonably and convincingly in terms of anyone's specific "ancestry." Yet exactly these claims have been made by Aboriginal groups and have led to the repatriation and handing over of skeletal remains to Aboriginal communities for reburial and destruction, as politicians and sci- entists alike wish to buy peace with such token concessions. The remains of the (cremated) female skeleton found at Lake Mungo (with an estimated age of around 30,000 years) have become affec- Anthropos 90.1995</page><page sequence="17">A Sense of History and the Reconstitution of Cosmology in Australian Aboriginal Society 65 tionally known as the "Mungo Lady" who is per- ceived by contemporary Aborigines in this area as a matriarchical ancestor figure. The mystical overtones of this conception are heightened by ex- pressions of feelings of affinity and kinship (both physical and cultural) with her. Ideologically of great relevance in the recon- stitution of Aboriginal identity - and politically important in terms of giving some leverage - is a sense of a history of victimisation. A politi- cal concept of injustice and the need for redress would not make sense and lose its relevance if it were devoid of an historical perspective which rationalises such issues as suffering loss of land and sovereignty, genocide, loss of culture and dig- nity, marginalisation, and so on, all of which is measurable only against the benchmark of history. Interestingly, as Jordan (1988: 120) points out, she found some resentment among older Aborigines of the constructions of the past in negative terms of humiliation, degradation - which reflects the selection made by well-meaning academics. Older Aborigines speak with greater tolerance of past injustice. "Certainly, many Aboriginal people be- lieve that, if Australian history is to be rewritten, it should dwell not only upon the facts of the oppression of Aboriginal people, but also on the strengths the people showed under oppression, and on the positive contributions made by Aboriginal people in Australia's history" (Jordan 1988: 121). In other words, the construction of Aboriginal history in terms of mindless, passive victimisation by an oppressive alien society - regardless of its truth value - lacks not only the desired overtones of creativity and activeness (which obviously ap- pear preferable to Aborigines), but lacks also in dignity and is therefore considered objectionable. By necessity the construction of an Aboriginal identity for urbanised and "detribalised" Aborig- ines must use an historical perspective, a retro- spect of their culture as it was at the time of the advent of the first Europeans (see Jordan 1988). For many Aboriginal people recovering that lost culture means reaching back into "history" to re- claim what has been forcibly taken from them. The Aboriginal artist Rikki Shields is reported to have expressed this amalgam notion of victimi- sation and recovering Aboriginality from history with the following words: "Some of us have been torn away from our language and culture. For us to get respect from the traditional people, who are our leaders, we have to bring our history back. If we fail, we'll be a lost generation forever with no past and no future" (The Bulletin 1991: 37). The past is of course overwhelmingly a White construct (mediated mainly by Anthropology with regard to the culture of the Aborigines), but at- tempts are well under way to "Aboriginalise" this perspective, as mentioned above. While there is a certain readiness to accept the time dimension and perception of depth of the past, there is also a tendency to exclude the notion of social change which in the Western perspective goes hand in hand. Instead cultural continuity and identity with the past are emphasised, very nearly insisting on a view of total immutability which reminds one of the Dreamtime concept. The difference is that in the latter case immutability was doctrinal, while now it is implicit and the result of an absence of a decisive vision of change. One has to bear in mind, that the relevant views are far from uniform among those people identi- fying as Aborigines nowadays. Those of the urban middle-class, of the educated elite and spokesper- sons on a national level - the ideology-brokers (among whom there is a fair percentage of Europe- ans) - are not exactly the same as of those Aborig- ines who live mainly in northern outback areas and who can still claim an unbroken continuity with pre-contact or early-contact cultural traditions. The views of the former are increasingly well public- ised now through a wide range of books, articles, and art forms. (For an incisive review of some of them see Maddock 1989.) The language of radical- ism belongs more to them (though some are sur- prisingly conciliatory) than the latter and it is their political views, as much as those of the former, which show a tendency to develop into mythical shapes, or, in other words, retreat from processual history to a level of time-less, undifferentiated, and clearly patterned myth: a view which juxtaposes the time of subjugation and humilation by Whites, the period from which all evil stems, with the golden age of pre-White Aboriginal society and with a glowing, utopian-like future of Aboriginal liberation.
