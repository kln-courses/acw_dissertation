<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERACLES AND HIS SUCCESSORS A STUDY OF A HEROIC IDEAL AND THE RECURRENCE OF A HEROIC TYPE BY ANDREW RUNNI ANDERSON T HE religion of the Greeks from the time that it dawns upon us in their earliest literature presents itself in its permanent char- acteristics as an anthropomorphic polytheism. The divinities are im- mortal, but not omnipotent; they are rather to be regarded as super- men and superwomen. It was therefore thoroughly logical that the ranks of these should from time to time receive accessions from super- men and superwomen as they arose. Heracles, Dionysus, Castor and Pollux, and occasionally Asclepius are to be regarded as such additions, human beings deified because of conspicuous services to mankind.? It 1 These with the addition from the Roman side of Romulus constitute what A. Elter, Donarem Pateras (Bonn, 1907), p. 40, calls "ein bestimmter Kanon von Halbg6ttern." The principal passages bearing on the matter are as follows: Cicero, de Nat. Deor. 2, 24, 62: Suscepit autem vita hominum consuetudoque communis, ut beneficiis excellentis viros in caelum fama ac voluntate tollerent. Hinc Hercu- les, hinc Castor et Pollux, hinc Aesculapius, hinc Liber etiam ... hinc etiam Romu- lus, quem quidem eundem esse Quirinum putant; quorum cum remanerent animi atque aeternitate fruerentur, rite di sunt habiti, cum et optimi essent et aeterni. Cf. de Legg. 2, 8, 19. Horace, C. 3, 3, 9 ff.; Epp. 2, I, 5 ff., to be quoted later. Tusc. Disp. I, 12, 27-28; Mortem non interitum esse omnia tollentem atque delentem, sed quandam quasi migrationem commutationemque vitae, quae in claris viris et feminis dux in caelum soleret esse, in ceteris humi retineretur et permaneret tamen. Ex hoc et nostrorum opinione 'Romulus in caelo cum dis agit aevum' ut famae ad- sentiens dixit Ennius, et apud Graecos indeque perlapsus ad nos et usque ad Oce- anum Hercules tantus et tam praesens habetur deus; hinc Liber Semela natus eademque famae celebritate Tyndaridae fratres, qui non modo adiutores in proe- liis victoriae populi Romani, sed etiam nuntii fuisse perhibentur. These and other passages from Ennius, Cicero, Silius Italicus, together with Lactantius's discussion of the pagan views of deification from the Christian point of view in the first book of his Divine Institutes, esp. I, 9-I, 18, are presented by Elter, op. cit. 40, 3-40, 19. His exceedingly valuable discussion of the deification of Romulus and of Scipio Africanus will be taken up later in this paper.</page><page sequence="2">8 Andrew Runni Anderson is a trite saying that the Greeks made no hard and fast demarcation between the human and the divine. As far as these divinities are con- cerned the theory of Euhemerism is gratuitous. Zeus is the father of both gods and men; but since the divinity of blood is likely to be diluted through remoteness of descent, it becomes essential that there be a reinfusion of divine blood in the case of those who are to be raised to divine status. One parent, therefore, generally the father, would have to step aside in favor of a god, thus paying the penalty for having begotten an immortal.' Thus Amphitryon as the father of Heracles, and Tyndareus as the father of Castor and Pollux and Helen, were thrust aside in favor of Zeus. But polytheism was destined to give way to monotheism. Had it not been for this develop- ment, Greek mythology would have undergone still further growth, there would have been further deifications, and we should be studying Alexander and Caesar and Augustus not primarily as historical char- acters, but as hero-gods added to the Greek or to the Greco-Roman pantheon. In fact this is the view of them that the pagan world took, and it is only the rise of Christianity that prevents us from taking the same view. They are par excellence the successors of Heracles. HERACLES The type of Heracles rather than that of any of the others has been chosen because he is sufficiently early to be an original for what may be regarded our western civilization, and because his contacts and applications are more numerous and generally more intimate for man- kind than are those of the others constituting the canon of demigods. The result is that an extraordinarily large number of great men have aspired to him as their ideal of achievement or been compared to him by their admirers. Furthermore, the moral value of his myth is ex- ceedingly high, as shown for instance in the Choice of Heracles by Pro- dicus preserved for us by Xenophon,2 which represents him as having the choice between the easy way of living in comfort and pleasure for himself or that of devoting himself altruistically to the service of hu- manity in what would be a life of toil and suffering, but which would bring culture and civilization to humankind. It was for him i?yepi oat 1 Cf. Plato, Apol. 27D; Arrian, Anab. 4, i, 1-3 ft. 2 Memorabilia 4, 6; Philostratus, Vit.

Superficially his end on the pyre on Mt. Oeta might be regarded as retribution for certain infidelities, but symbolically it represents the burning away of his mortal parts and his ascent to heaven in glory.3 For convenience the r6les played by Heracles might be regarded as two-fold - world-ruler (KOOUOKporTWp) and protector of man-kind (oaw'rp), the latter approaching that of saviour or even messiah. Zeus's purpose in begetting him may be inferred from the words of Agamemnon in the Iliad, 19, 103-5: ao7pepov vpa cboa6e ioyo-r6Kos eXelOveLC EKqavet, 6's, 7d vTeovtTrTL ptEPLKrt6VOEOtV lEL, TrV &amp;v5pw~P "' YEvE%?o, O'0' a)Ci'LAa  LtE) C ito, a conception of him that grew and expanded until we find Dio Chrysos- tom, Or.

The last two lines (sometimes without real reason suspected of being interpolated) seem to foretell that Heracles will inaugurate an era of idyllic peace - a kind of golden age. Thus Heracles became the symbol of service, an outstanding awcrrp in Greek religion, and to the subsequent pagan world he became the type of hero who chose to do the right irrespective of rewards or consequences. The fourth century before Christ had in much of its philosophic thought a strong tendency toward monarchy. This was particularly true of the Academy and of the Cynics, by whom it was passed on to the Stoa. As Kampers 2 says: "In der Unzufriedenheit mit den politischen Verh~ltnissen der Gegenwart erinnerte man sich des Riesengestalts des Heracles, den man zum Muster eines KSnigs und zum Vorbild fUir den Welteroberer und Weltbeherrscher machte." Heracles grew with the geographical horizon. Tacitus, Germ. 34: Ipsum quin etiam Oceanum illa temptavimus: et superesse Herculis 1 This passage is quoted by Kukula, RKmische Sdkularpoesie, p. 64, n. 2, in connection with Vergil's Fourth Eclogue, and also by Norden, Die Geburt des Kindes, p. 52, n. I. Norden quotes also Aristophanes, Peace 1075 ff., thus carrying back still further the conception of the Tierfriede among the Greeks: ou ydp 7"rw 70TU7' O e(Tr I iXov IpaKapeooL GOEoclwv, qvX6'rtos X?at, 7rpiv KEy XibKos oyv b VLEvatoL. 2 F. Kampers, Alexander d. Grosse und die Idee des Weltimperiumns in Prophetie u. Sage, Freiburg (1901), p. 20. Kampers holds that Heracles had attained to this position in Cynic philosophic thought before Alexander and independently of him, a view now apparently concurred in by Kaerst, Gesch. d. Hell.

I; 310o, 379-</page><page sequence="5">Heracles and his Successors II columnas fame vulgavit sive adiit Hercules, seu quicquid ubique mag- nificum est, in claritatem eius referre consensimus, etc. Tacitus was not in a position to know that Hercules had set up his columns even on the Columbia River Highway. The pervasive power of Heracles's example may be shown by a few illustrations. When Socrates set out to find a man wiser than himself and thus to confute the oracle, he used language which no one could fail to understand as a reminiscence of the labors of Heracles, though he mentioned no name, Plato, Apol. 22a: E3? 7)V4 /uIP- rT7v E'y y rTXyurV7 aro68ELaL i O-rEp 7rbVovs TLVUS 7LO1WTOs tia o/L KaC oYEXVYKST 7'7 IoavT7Ela tyeoLro. Likewise, when Lysander was plotting to put himself at the head of affairs in Sparta, we are told by Plutarch' that he planned to take the power away from the two royal families and to give it to all the Hera- cleidae in common; or, as some say, not to the Heracleidae alone, but to all Spartans, that the reward might not belong to the posterity of Heracles, but to those who were like Heracles if judged by that personal merit which raised him to godhead, and he hoped that when the king- dom was thus to be competed for, no Spartan would be preferred to himself.2 Aristotle, because of his ode to Arete 3 in which he names his friend and former patron Hermeias of Atarneus as a successor of Heracles, Castor and Pollux, of Achilles and Ajax, was by his enemies charged with impiety as having written a paean in honor of a mortal. At this time we may brush technicalities aside, recognize that heroiza- tion was in the air, and classify the poem as in essence a paean. Time was pregnant with other candidates for deification to whom paeans would actually be addressed. Before proceeding further with my study I desire to make a twofold observation: I. That in form deification was a religious act, adding a divinity to those already recognized by the state. In a polytheistic religion it 1 Plut., Lys. 24. 2 I may add that Nicostratus the Argive, cured by Menecrates, was made to assume the r6le of Heracles (Athenaeus, 289b), and that Themison, favorite of Antiochus II, received worship in the r61e of Heracles (Athenaeus, 289 f.-29o).

Taken by itself it might be just as innocuous as the canonization of a saint or the con- ferring of a high honorary degree. Such deification however, did not regularly come until after death 1- immortalitatem ipsa morte quaer- ebat, Cic., Tusc. 2, 20; emit morte immortalitatem, Quintilian 9, 3, 71; post ingentia facta (which means after death) Hor., Epp. 2, 1.6; or as Callisthenes, as quoted by Q. Curtius 8, 5, 16, says: hominem con- sequitur aliquando, numquam comitatur divinitas. Most important of all are the words of Callisthenes quoted by Arrian, Anab. 4, 11i, 7: OVKOVV OV_ aVTW TW HpaKXEZ 3TL ETL OEtCTOICtL 7rcLp UEXX?1vOW E VOVTO, AXX' oV ob TEXEVTb' 77oTL o rpoaoEv 7 7rp's - To1NEOv TO1) EJJ AEX 4)0 IS EOECT~rLar07- vat cos NE&amp;V TLav r6v 'HpaKXEta. II. The tendency of Greek philosophic thought toward monarchy gave deification a new phase; it is that when a man's abilities so surpass the combined abilities of his fellows, for him the change of magistrates and subjection to the law can not hold; rather is he as a god among men, against whom the law can not stand, inasmuch as he is himself the law.2 This conception was destined to have momentous consequences for the successors of Heracles and for their worshippers and subjects. It made the Greek lovers of the olden liberty sick at heart. The successors of Heracles might henceforth not find virtue its own or its only reward; they might not have to wait until after death to receive the guerdon of deification; it would not be post ingentia facta, but propter ingentia facta, and divinity instead of following a man might be his concomitant. ALEXANDER3 Alexander was descended from Zeus - on his mother's side by way of Achilles and Aeacus, and on that of his father through Heracles 1 Such was indeed the previous practice of the Macedonian royal house, Baege, de Macedonum sacris, Halle (1913), p. 208. Philip's assassination at the wedding of his daughter left it easily to be inferred that he considered himself the thirteenth god, and is significant as well as sinister. 2 Arist., Pol. 3, 13 end, and 3, 17 end. 3 On the matter of Heracles and his successors the two following works are very illuminating: Seneca, Ludus de Morte Claudii (Apocolocyntosis) and Julian,</page><page sequence="7">Heracles and his Successors 13 and Perseus - a most remarkable genealogy. Think of such material coming to such a teacher as Aristotle to be inspired by him with true appreciation for the Greek heroic past and the heroes of the Trojan war, especially Achilles, and to learn from him political wisdom, perhaps the very thought referred to above! Such an initial equipment supplemented by his inheritance from Philip of the kingdom of Macedon with its finely organized army and by his own achievement in conquering the East was bound to bring to maturity thoughts that were both new and great. Stimulated by his love of Homer, Alexander began his Asiatic con- quests as the representative of the Hellene against the barbarian. His Caesares (Symposium). In the former of these Hercules, a burlesque character, speaks for, and Augustus in propria persona speaks against, the proposed admission of Claudius as divus to Olympus. In the latter work Romulus gives a banquet in heaven; for we are told that after Heracles Quirinus also ascended thither, 307B. Heracles asks Quirinus why he did not invite Alexander. Quirinus admits that his descendants have been great admirers of Alexander, 316 B-D, and sends for him. Then speeches are delivered in the following order: Caesar, Alexander, Octavian, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, Constantine, each stating his claim to be awarded the decision of having proved himself the greatest. The decision being awarded to Marcus Aurelius, each is told to choose his guardian and guide (335D ff.), whereat Alexander hastened to Heracles, Octavian to Apollo, Marcus to Zeus and Kronos, while Caesar was lost until Ares and Aphrodite took pity on him and summoned him to themselves. Trajan hastened to Alexander and sat down by him, and Con- stantine chose Pleasure and Incontinence and - Jesus. While to Julian himself is given the hope by Hermes that when he departs the mortal life, he will obtain the knowledge of his father Mithra, whom with good hopes he adopts as his guardian guide. (The idea of the succession or of the recurrence of heroes in Greco-Roman religion or mythology may be paralleled from sacred history. In the transfiguration (Matthew XVII, 2; Mark IX, 2-5; Luke IX, 29-32) Christ was seen to be present with Moses and Elijah. The recently discovered Russian version of Josephus says: "At that time also a man came forward, if one may call a man one whom his dis- ciples called the son of God .... His name was Jesus, and he was surnamed the Messiah. By the gentiles he was believed to be a soothsayer, but some of our own people said of him that he was our first law-giver (Moses), and had risen from the dead and was showing forth many cures and acts. Others, however, said that he was the envoy of God." See the articles in the Rev. de l'Histoire des Religions, XCIII (1926) esp. pp. 15, 27, and 47, by Eisler, Goguel, and Couchoud. See also vol. III of the edition of Josephus in the Loeb Classical Library by Thackeray (1928), pp. 648-9.)</page><page sequence="8">14 Andrew Runni Anderson hero seems at this time to have been Achilles.' This is shown by his ceremonies on the site of Troy and his oft quoted exclamation in which he esteemed Achilles happy for having found Homer as the herald of his prowess. But it was in the temple of Heracles at Troy that Alex- ander saw the shield of Achilles. As time went on, however, and his conception of himself as representative of the Hellenes was merged in cosmopolitanism with himself as cosmocrator, the sphere of Achilles seems to have impressed him as too localized to serve as his own model, with the result that he inclined more and more to the other side of his ancestry, that is, to Heracles. For instance, when he had a son by Barsine, Memnon's widow, he called his name not Achilles, but Heracles.2 As Alexander went on with his conquests his sacrifices to the gods always included Heracles, often Dionysus. At the siege of Tyre Heracles appeared to him in his sleep to encourage him, and at the capture of Tyre the worshippers of Heracles received preferential treatment. Very illuminating is the statement that Julian, Caesares 324-325, puts in the mouth of Alexander, who thus addressed Caesar: E7T -EIOTOX/.'CLS CLCI7176LoTrV, OS EK ' arLkapov a7rpan7'yv pya P"rpcarpa T7)XLKaV^ra, r ra, TE fT7O JV7/U?7V, KC2rLEp OUK C'LCOS i~rb% Tr.

This is seen in the story of Batis the valiant defender of Gaza, who like a second Hector was trailed from Alexander's chariot. See Perrin, TAPA, XXVI (1895), pp. 56 ff.; see the further literature on Batis cited by Berve, Das Alexanderreich II, p. 105 s.v. Batis. The parallel between Patroclus and Hephaestion is a striking one, Perrin, op. cit., p. 59, who quotes Arrian, Anab. 7, 14, 4: Ka-rd [Xov rv 'AXtXXws rpos 6vrtva ~K 7ratsos tXornl, d Iv ai~r43. 2 Tarn, Heracles, Son of Barsine, in JHS. XLI (1921), pp. i ff., has tried to show that this Heracles was a mere fiction. Berve, op. cit., II, p. 168 (no. 353) does not accept Tarn's view. Although the chronological difficulties are great, the name Heracles is not one which would readily have been invented. The name Alexander Helios which Antony gave to his son by Cleopatra can hardly be anything else than a reflection from Alexander's giving the name Heracles to his son by Barsine, though of course it might just as well be the reflection of an established legend as of reality.</page><page sequence="9">Heracles and his Successors 15 f3W7LXLLos, 0' OEPW7COV E'_Y KC'0 Kl7XcoAT ~'yeV6PV, 'AXLXXEZ AL&amp;V eLILXXC4L.EVOS r3 wpo'Y6vY, 'HpaKX'a 3 OavAt'COwv Kat 'w.''vos, cTrE 3 Ka-r' 'iXp Oeov^ avOpworos. Statius describes a bronze statuette of Heracles Epitrapezius by Lysippus, which had presumably been made for Alexander by him and which was treated by Alexander as his guardian god. The perti- nent part for our purpose is Silvae 4, 6, 59 ff.: Pellaeus habebat regnator laetis numen venerabile mensis et comitem occasus secum portabat et ortus praestabatque libens modo quae diademata dextra abstulerat dederatque et magnas verterat urbes.

In order to become the legitimate successor of the pharaohs Alexander must secure acknowledgment of his sonship to Ammon. Scholars have frequently pointed out that the obvious place to obtain such acknowl- edgment was Thebes. In Egypt such acknowledgment was equiva- lent to deification, not however elsewhere. There must accordingly have been an additional motive to take Alexander so far out of his way as to the Ammoneum on the Oasis of Siwah to have his sonship to Zeus-Ammon confirmed there. Eduard Meyer2 has suggested that con- firmation at the Ammoneum was intended to impress upon the Greeks of the homeland the fact that the oracle of Ammon had now passed into sympathetic attitude toward Alexander, even as that of Apollo at Delphi had previously done. To this should be added the other reasons adduced by Arrian,3 the fact that Alexander undertook the 1 Silvae 4, 6, 59; Martial 9, 43 and 44 informs us that the statuette in his day was in the house of Novius Vindex, and that in the meantime it had been in the possession of Hannibal and Sulla. 2 Cf. Eduard Meyer, Kleine Schriften, p. 303; Maspero, Comment Alexandre devint dieu en Agypte, republished in Etudes de Mythologie et d'ArchIzologie egyptiennes, VI (1912). 3 Arrian, Anab. 3, 3, 1-2.</page><page sequence="10">16 Andrew Runni Anderson journey emulously following in the steps of his ancestors Perseus and Heracles, both of whom had visited it in days of yore. The full sig- nificance of this statement, however, has not been brought out until there is cited in support of it the statement of Callisthenes in his speech, quoted by Arrian,' that it was the Delphic oracle that issued the decree that men should honor Heracles as a god. The oracle of Ammon in confirming the sonship of Alexander to Ammon was ad- vancing Alexander toward the same goal as the successor of Heracles. A significant passage is that of Arrian,2 which describes the facts leading up to the murder of Clitus: aXX' "iv yE 7&amp; vwbrm TOrE brip roV ALO KoVpol, XYovS ylyeviEoOaL, dtWS b S e ~ Ana rhusxO andCroa 7t yVeL, c4aLpeEdona TvvGpdapl .

Callisthenes countered by saying that not even to Heracles himself were divine honors paid during his lifetime by the Greeks, and that even after his death they were withheld until a decree had been pub- lished by the god at Delphi that men should honor him as a god.4 According to Quintus Curtius the opponents of Callisthenes were Agis the Argive and Cleo the Sicilian and not Anaxarchus. He reports the speech of Cleo in indirect discourse p: Persas quidem non pie solum, sed etiam prudenter reges suos inter deos colere: maiestatem enim imperii salutis esse tutelam.

Debere idem facere ceteros et imprimis sapientia praeditos: ab illis enim cultus in regem exemplum esse prodendum. The response of Callisthenes includes the following: 1 Intervallo enim opus est, ut credatur deus, semperque hanc gratiam magnis viris posteri reddunt. Ego autem seram immortalitatem precor regi, ut et vita diuturna sit et aeterna maiestas. Hominem consequitur aliquando, numquam comitatur divinitas.

Di propitii sine invidia, quae Cleo dixit, audierint eodemque cursu, quo fluxere adhuc res, ire patiantur. When the Greeks reached India they thought that they discovered traces of Heracles and Dionysus. Curtius 2 actually says: Igitur Alexandro finis Indiae ingresso gentium finitimarum reguli occurrerunt imperata facturi, illum tertium Iove genitum ad ipsos pervenisse memo- rantes: Patrem Liberum, atque Herculem fama cognitos esse, ipsum coram adesse cernique.

The process of thought by which the identification was made has been stated in several places, Dionysus being identified with the Indian god, giva, and Heracles with Krishna.4 In conformity with this identi- fication, when the Greeks reached the rocks of Aornos, they found that 1 Curtius, 8, 5, 15 ff. 2 Curtius, 8, Io, I ff.; cf.

Graef, de Bacchi expeditione</page><page sequence="12">18 Andrew Runni Anderson it had proved impregnable even to Heracles, whereat Alexander was fired with the ambition to take it and thus to surpass his ancestor.1 Arrian thinks that Heracles was introduced here merely to serve Alexander in his vainglory. This is grossly unfair. The Greeks natur- ally believed their religion, that is, their mythology and its divinities to be ecumenical and universal (hence their identifications), and as their geographical horizon was extended, so likewise the sphere through which their gods exerted their power was enlarged. We must here recognize what the Germans very felicitously call Ankniipfung an den Mythus.2 When on the Hyphasis Alexander's soldiers refused to follow him further, he made a speech in which he set forth his plans." These were to conquer India to the end (he did not know of Indo-China and Indica, Berlin (1886), pp. i ff.; B. I. Wheeler, Alexander the Great,2 New York (1925), pp. 427-28. The passages in which Alexander is associated with the Indian expeditions of Heracles and Dionysus are most of them to be found in the fragments of Megas- thenes, FHG. II, 397 ff. Inasmuch as my chief interest is with Heracles, I note that the name of Dionysus has been interpolated in Pseudo-Callisthenes in the Ms A in 3, 4, 9 (p. 103, io Kroll).

HERACLES-ALEXANDER IN THE ALEXANDER ROMANCE There can be no thoroughgoing distinction between the purely his- torical and the romantic in the career of Alexander. In this study there- fore the division must be somewhat arbitrary. For the legend of Alexander began so conspicuously even during his lifetime, that what people thought of him, and the impression he made upon them are elements that for my purpose are quite as vital as what he in sober history actually was. However unhistorical the Alexander Romance may be, it is in large measure made up of elements that can be traced back to a historical source, and in most ways these deviate less from the reality than the stories of Romulus current in the time of Augustus or Plutarch deviated from the real Romulus. The story that Philip was not really his father owes its origin chiefly to the strained relations existing between Philip and Olympias. The form that the story of his conception took is probably based on some such story as that told by Plutarch,2 to the effect that Olympias as part of the cult to which she had been initiated became used to the pp. 451-2 claims that the speech is a rhetorical composition of the early Christian era. Tarn, Alexander and the Ganges, JHS. XLIII (1923), 93 ff., refers it back to Cleitarchus. Its authenticity has been doubted also by Niese, Hist. Zeitschr. XLIII, 41 ff. Berve, op. cit., I, p. 325 and n. i, seems to favor its authenticity. 1 Curtius, 9, II, 29. 2 Plutarch, Alex. 2; also mentioned by Lucian Dial. Mort. 13. The process of growth of the legend of Alexander's birth is given by Carraroli, La leggenda di Alessandro Magno, Mondovi (1892), pp. 36, 56.</page><page sequence="14">20 Andrew Runni Anderson handling of large tame serpents, and that Philip's love for her cooled after he found a serpent in bed with her. Plutarch also tells of an oracle foretelling to Philip that he would lose the sight of the eye with which through the keyhole he saw Olympias in the embrace of a god. The author of the Alexander Romance, although he did not pre- clude the comparison of Alexander with other divinities, as e.g., with Dionysus, represented him predominantly as a second Heracles. In doing this he was as a rule not practising invention, but following tradition. And the story of Alexander as he composed it runs parallel to that of Heracles in a number of outstanding features, e.g., his conception, his birth, some of his achievements such as his taming of Bucephalas, his visit to Delphi, his meeting with the Amazons, and even his death, as the following selections will show. Conception. Nectanebos, exiled king of Egypt, flees to Pella in Macedonia where he establishes himself as an astrologer and magician. Conceiving a passion for Olympias he succeeds in being summoned by her to give her advice, inasmuch as Philip had threatened to divorce her because of her barrenness. He promises that to the god Ammon she will bear a son who will be her avenger. The Syrian version 1, 6 (Nectanebos speaking) says: "For this god when he comes to thee will be in the form of a serpent and will creep and crawl on the ground sending forth loud hisses. Then he will return, and his horns will be in the form of those of a ram; thus will he be. Then he will return again, and will appear in the form of the hero Heracles; and he will return a third time, and appear in the form of Dionysus, decorated and ornamented with ringlets, and he will return yet again, coming back and appearing in my own form." ... I, 7 ... "And when Nectanebos had said these words, he went to his own chamber; and afterwards at this time he slept with her in the form of Ammon and Heracles and Dionysus." 1 1 BLBy agree with Sy here. The passage in By is 283 ff.; cf. 345 ff. In trying to explain the combination Ammon-Heracles-Dionysus Weinreich, Der Trug des Nektanebos, pp. 12-13 with nn. 1-5 inclusive, has placed the emphasis wrongly. "Ich kann darin nichts anderes erblicken als ein Zugestiindnis an jene mythische Genealogie, die das makedonische Herrscherhaus von Herakles und Dionysus abstammen liess, eine Fiktion, von der sowohl Alexander wie auch die Ptolemiier starken Gebrauch machten."

(I, io L). In the Syrian version 1 Ammon appears to Alexander in a dream and explains to him his symbolic conception from Ammon-Heracles- Dionysus, thus confirming what Olympias had told him of his father: "Thou art of my race, and thou hast in thee parts of the characteristics of four gods; and if thou dost not believe that it is possible for a mortal and corruptible man to be born of the race of an immortal and incor- ruptible god, I tell thee that they are able as men to be of the race of the gods, not in respect of the nature of the body, but in respect of wisdom, intelligence and fore-knowledge. Therefore, by the union of the race of the gods with men, they are able both to know and to do everything that is marvellous and difficult in the world. Now thou hast in thee somewhat of the race of the serpent, and of Heracles, and of Dionysus, and of Ammon. Through the serpent thou wilt encircle the whole earth like a dragon; through Heracles thou wilt be strong like Heracles, and thou wilt show forth in thy person the finding of power and might; through Dionysus thou wilt continually be in pleasure, and merriment, and joy; and through Ammon who is like myself, thou wilt hold rich sceptre, and thou wilt be lord of the world in royalty and wealth. As regards these words then have no doubt." Only in the Syrian version is this wealth of mythological symbolism given. The Romance tells of the birth of Alexander in much the same way that Plautus tells of the birth of Heracles in the Amphitruo, amid thunder, lightning, earthquakes. Plautus however lacks the astro- logical elements, and these as found in the Romance, I, 12 (especially in A and Sy) have been used by Boll and Norden as parallels for the phenomena attending the birth of the child in Vergil's Fourth Eclogue.2 the Alexander Romance featured Dionysus as a ?rpo~r&amp;4wp of Alexander. The truer explanation is offered by the Syrian version in the supplement next quoted, namely, that Ammon, Heracles, Dionysus are symbolically Alexander's fathers. 1 Budge, The History of Alexander the Great, Cambridge, 1889, I, 30, p. 37. We must indeed acknowledge that this passage was not a part of the recensio vetusta, but the invention of the Syrian redactor is true to character. 2 Norden, Die Geburt des Kindes, p. 21, n. i.

Philip therefore expected the birth of a new Heracles. Alexander qualified by riding the horse and his father acclaimed him KoOLOKp&amp;roWp.1 At the feast celebrating the marriage of Philip with Cleopatra, Alexander in some of the manuscripts (By) is described as resenting the charge of illegitimacy there bandied; then, resembling a new Heracles at the feast of the Centaurs and Lapiths, or a new Odysseus slaying the suitors he drove out the whole company.2 Then Alexander went to the temple of Apollo and asked the priestess to give him a response about his future; when she, however, professed that she could not give responses, inasmuch as the god was not inspiring her, Alexander grew angry and said: Ka' E -EXOWPv Els d T70 o'AwrbXXoMvo t'p ' ifl?toU rT7P cotSl@XlXOY V o a7 r avrcEc'TaEcJaOL T?- sE XE-yObe?7s Ci XPfl7o- 0TETeL aU"'r 7T6 TO'a rTELoY ' OpyOLOEls ' 'AXEcwav6pos elrEv.

Sober historians like Ptolemy and Aristobulus make no mention whatever of the meeting of Alexander with the Amazons, thus showing that the theme is not in any sense historical.4 The theme, however, was one that offered irresistible temptation to writers with romantic imagi- nations like Onesicritus and Clitarchus, and it is from them that the story including the version as given in the Alexander Romance, I Alex.

Thus did they align Alexander with Theseus and Heracles.- In his return march from the far East, as he approached Babylon, if not before, Alexander was met by certain disquieting utterances and prophecies, and even after he reached Babylon they persisted. The one most pertinent to my present purpose is that narrated in the Romance 3, 30, which represents a woman as having given birth to a monstrosity the upper part of which was human and died, but the lower parts consisted of a number of animal heads that lived. The Chaldean soothsayers interpreted the death of the human part as re- ferring to the approaching death of Alexander. "And when Alexander heard all these things, he was in grief and trouble and, sighing, he said, 'O Zeus, it would have been right that I should have finished all my plans and then died; but since it has appeared good unto thee thus, command that they receive me as the third dead.' This speech he said for this reason: Dionysus was a man, and because of the name and fame and power he made for himself he was reckoned when dead among the number of the gods; and in like manner Heracles; therefore Alexander spoke of himself as 'the third dead' because these had not gained such name and fame and power as Alexander." 2 It is generally held that in the Greco-Roman world it was Alexander who began the practice of impersonating divinities - a practice that was destined to reach its height in the Roman empire. It may, however, be debated whether Alexander himself actually did this; for there is the possibility that it was only under his successors that the practice came into existence, and that from them it was retroactively carried back to him. The locus classicus on this subject is from Ephippus of Olynthus, a somewhat younger contemporary of Alexander, sometimes suspected of fictional tendencies, as quoted by Athenaeus 537E, where it is stated that at banquets Alexander impersonated Ammon, Artemis, Hermes, and Heracles. Curiously enough Dionysus and Apollo-Helius are not mentioned. The r61le of Heracles has been chosen 1 Arrian, Anab. 7, 13, 5. See also Ausfeld, op. cit. in his Historische Kommentar to III, 25 on pp. 192-3 where the following passages are cited in addition: Arrian, Anab. 4, 15, 4 ff.; 7, 13, 2 ff.; Diod. 17, 77, I ff.; Curtius 6, 5, 24 ff.; Justin 12, 3, 5 Ef.; Strabo, 505. 2 Syrian version, p. 135, Budge, 3, 19 (i.e., 30).</page><page sequence="18">24 Andrew Runni Anderson for study inasmuch as it seems to be the most typical, the most signi- ficant, and the most lasting. A study of the cults will show that Hera- cles and Dionysus are the gods most intimately connected with the daily life of the Macedonians,' and that the same historical character may be identified with more than one divinity,2 the r6les being com- plementary rather than competitive. For example Alexander, Mark Antony, and Augustus each com- bined in his own person the r61es of a new Heracles and a new Dionysus. Too frequently, however, Alexander-Dionysus had been stressed at the expense of Alexander-Heracles. And yet in spite of the importance to which Dionysus attained under the later Lagids, Heracles came to the ascendant in a number of characters like Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Romulus; in the east where Alexander was equated with Gilgamesh or with Artagnes; and in the Roman emperors who succeeded Augus- tus, not to mention the Alexander Romance and even down into the middle ages in Lambert li Tors. In fact there are at least two places in the Greek Alexander Romance where the r61le of Dionysus can be proved to be an interpolated one: Dionysus before Aornus, 3, 4, 9A; Dionysus at Tyre, i, 35 A, Ar, B, C, L, (see Ausfeld, op. cit., Histor. Kommentar to I, 35). The extreme development is seen in the Syrian version. Half a century after Alexander's death Theocritus 3 represented Ptolemy and Alexander as deified in heaven and there serving as the paladins of Heracles, to whom they both trace back their lineage, both now ageless, the one escorting him as he carries his bow for him and the other his club. The absence of Dionysus from this scene is significant. It is only under the subsequent Lagids,4 when Dionysus 1 Baege, de Macedonum sacris, pp. 77 ff.; 184 ff. 2 An extreme instance of this may be cited in the case of Caligula who, according to Dio Cassius, 59, 26, 5 ff., and Philo, de Leg. 1i ff., appeared impersonating the r6les not only of a large number of gods, but also of goddesses! Cf. Alexander's impersonation of Artemis, charged to him by Ephippus as stated above. The pas- sages for Caligula are cited by Riewald, de imnperatorum Romanorum cum certis dis et comparatione et aequatione, Halle (1912), pp. 281-3. 3 Theocritus, 17, 13-33, a passage too long for quotation. 4 Kornemann, Zur Gesc4ichte der antiken Herrscherkulte, in Klio, I (1902), pp. 51 ff., has brought this out on p. 67, n. 5, namely that the descent of the Lagids from Heracles was emphasized only by the earlier Ptolemies, and was then later pressed into the background by the later ones. The effect of this was made retro-</page><page sequence="19">Heracles and his Successors 25 had become identified with Osiris, that Dionysus comes into promi- nence both as KOUoOKpTCroop and as fbepyirn7s and the divinity with whom the male ruler of Egypt was identified. active, and on p. 70 he says: "Bemerkenswert ist noch, dass jetzt Dionysus als der Stammvater der aegyptischen Dynastie und als derjenige 'dem Alexander sich wesensverwandt gefiihlt hatte' (Prott, p. 462) tiber dem ganzen thront." Overemphasis on the extent to which Alexander appeared as Dionysus in cult and legend is found in Kern's article on Dionysus in Pauly-Wissowa, V, 1039 ff. and above all in the article of Miss Lily Ross Taylor on 7rpotKbVraLr in JHS. XLVII (1927), pp. 53 ff. She says on p. 61: "Significantly enough it was as Dionysus, the god with whom the good Salpwv honored at banquets was identified, the deity of unmixed wine, that the Athenians vouched for his godhead (Diog. Laert. 6, 2, 63), and it is as Dionysus too that the king lived in story in the East." The success of this symbolical 7rpoaKrvflOG (p. 62) "prepared the way for the identification of Alex- ander with Dionysus in cult and legend, and it persisted in the honor offered at banquets to the guardian spirits of Hellenistic kings and Roman emperors." Miss Taylor's argument that the use of wine in the symbolic IrpoaCKVflrLS of Alexander identified him with Dionysus is far from cogent. She gives the impres- sion of forbidding other identification, particularly with Heracles. That Dionysus deserves no such exclusiveness ought to be perfectly clear from the evidence sub- mitted in this paper. The close relation existing between Alexander and Heracles is established by such passages as Theocritus, 17, 13 ff., and Statius Silvae 4, 6, 59 ff- Augustus's identification with Mercury or with Romulus-Quirinus or with Apollo- Helius did not preclude his being compared with Dionysus or with Heracles. (See p. 24 with n. 2.) Most striking of all, however, is the passage in Horace refer- ring to the worship of Augustus and addressed to Augustus, C. 4, 5, 31 ff.: (Note that Horace cites Castor and Hercules as parallel in Greek usage to the numen of Augustus) Hinc ad vina redit laetus et alteris Te mensis adhibet deum; Te multa prece, te prosequitur mero Defuso pateris et Laribus tuum Miscet numen, uti Graecia Castoris Et magni memor Herculis. See also Riewald op. cit., p. 318, who cites no evidence of a Lagid identified with Dionysus before Ptolemy IV, Philopator, 222-205/4 B.C. With reference to Dionysus-Alexander there may be quoted besides Diog. Laert. 6, 2, 63, the painting by Protogenes of Dionysus-Alexander and Pan; see Berve, Alexanderreich, II, no. 666. Meineke's proposal, however, that the Dionys- alexandros of Cratinus was by a younger Cratinus and that it alluded 'ad Alexandri Magni expeditionem, Dionysiacae pompae adsimulatam' has been proved to be wrong by Kock, Fragmenta Att.

This study considers Alexander in the r61e of KOOT/.oKpa7wp from the Greek view as a successor of Heracles. The r6le of KOOTOoKpr7Wp in succession to Dionysus was hardly in accordance with the Greek tradition, but it was made possible by Egyptian influence and by syncretism. Tarn I has expressed doubt as to whether we have any authentic record of Alexander's plan of world kingdom, and he holds that the two passages in Diodorus, 17, 93, 4 (which goes back to 17, 51, 2) and 18, 4, 4, are derived from Egyptian ritual and theologumena. His latter contention is valid, and there should be quoted in connection with it an earlier passage from Diodorus, 3, 73, i, which speaks of Dionysus as having conquered the world.2 It should be pointed out that among the Egyptians Sesostris was the traditional world con- queror. Furthermore, Alexander's name was early brought into con- nection with other alleged world conquerors, e.g., Tearcon, Nebuchad- nezzar, Idanthyrsus, Semiramis, and Cyrus.3 It is worth mentioning also that the Alexander Romance does not make Alexander in his capacity of world conqueror a successor of either Heracles or Dionysus, but of Sesonchosis.4 Alexander's coming was early associated with the appearance of a star. This is implied by the words of Cicero: I Qua nocte templum Ephesiae Dianae deflagravit, eadem constat ex Olympiade natum esse Alexandrum, atque ubi lucere coepisset, clamitasse magos pestem atque perniciem Asiae proxuma nocte natam.6 A star appears in the so-called Ptolemy Cameo of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg.'

And when Alexander had said this, straightway a dense mist formed and darkness came on, and the fiery shape of a serpent de- scended from heaven to the sea, and therewith a great eagle, and the image of Zeus in Babylon was shaken. And the serpent ascended again to heaven and the eagle followed it carrying a bright star. And when the star was lost in the heavens, Alexander closed his eyes." The tradition persisted, however, that Alexander was not really dead but merely slumbering or translated, and that he would return as the king in glory. One such reappearance is told by Dio Cassius, 79, 18. Centuries afterward, when Christianity was grappling with Islam in the near East, probably under the emperor Leo VI (886-911), there arose the hope and the prophecy that he would return at the sign of a bright star, "ein Heroldruf wird erschallen, zwei Engel in Eunuchengestalt finden den K6nig und flihren ihn herbei. Unter Wundern vollzieht sich seine Kr6nung. Der leuchtende Stern fillt hernieder. Mit himmlischem Licht wird der K6nig gesalbt. Er wird den Islam besiegen und dann nach Zion hinaufziehen." ' The same star that marked his passing was destined to reappear as the comet that typified the soul of Caesar, the heir of Alexander's political ideals, and the form and ceremonial of deification of the Ro- man emperor was a combination of the pyre of Heracles and Hephaes- 1 Furtwitngler, op. cit.

The identification of Alexander with Heracles had certain far- reaching results. It was not merely a case of the syncretism of the two; but it involved in some particulars the supplanting of Heracles by Alexander. Thus Alexander's horns are at times found transferred to Heracles,l and as a result of Alexander's conquests Heracles was in the course of time provided with pillars in the far east bearing his name.2 Furthermore, there came to be associated with Alexander certain features of astrological symbolism, for which Heracles fur- nishes no parallel, and in tracing the Heraclean succession in the large it becomes necessary to include these. We may believe that even during the lifetime of Alexander his coins with the head of Heracles seem to assume the Macedonian's features," and on the silver coins of his successors the head of Heracles was re- placed by that of Alexander.4 Pictures and medallions show him with the spoils of a lion artistically fashioned to cover his head,5 and Athe- naeus 6 quotes Ephippus as saying that Alexander frequently appeared wearing a lion's skin and carrying the club of Heracles. Lampridius I in the Augustan History speaks of Alexander Severus as holding an "agon Herculeus in honorem Alexandri Magni," and Trebellius Pollio,8 Augustan History, describes a banquet given by Cornelius Macer in the temple of Heracles in honor of Alexander the Great.

Plainly in a re- ligion of this sort that lacked every trace of anthropomorphism, it was neither practicable nor desirable to be deified; there could be no suc- cessors of Heracles on Roman soil until there had been a decided advance into anthropomorphism. This development, which is a per- fectly normal one in religion, would naturally have come about of itself in the course of time; but, as it was, it was accelerated by the spread of Greek religious concepts and of Greek mythology to Italy, especially the extension of the Trojan cycle to explain and to include Roman origins. In establishing this in the Roman consciousness the influence of Ennius was profound, and his euhemerism has a particu- larly close bearing on the deification of Romulus and Scipio. In the course of time also there came in from the East such influences as Babylonian astrology and oriental prophecies of world empire, and these influences, when Rome's world dominion was an accomplished fact or all but an accomplished fact, would explain this empire as something fated from the very beginning. ROMULUS The first successor to Heracles on Roman soil was Romulus, and here the words of Cicero 1 may be taken as the point of departure: Romulus in caelo cum dis agit aevum, ut famae adsentiens dixit Ennius, et apud Graecos indeque perlapsus ad nos et usque ad Oceanum Hercules tantus et tam praesens habetur deus, etc. a ses puins k'il ot gros, les ocist erraument, puis conquist-il le tiere desi en Orient; *iluec mit-il ses bones, voiant tote la gent; tout ensi le voit-on e 1' tref apertement. en le fin de l'estore i est com faitement le ciel tient sor sen col, par son encantement. Alixandres li rois i esgarde souvent, et quant l'a remir6, si fait sen serement que tout ensi fera, si il vit lonjement. 1 Tusc. Disp. I, 12, 28; the passage is quoted in full above, p. 7, n. I.</page><page sequence="24">30 Andrew Runni Anderson In the interpretation of this passage the following facts are to be noticed: i. That the influences that brought about the deification of Romu- lus came from the Greeks, and that consequently neither Romulus nor his contemporaries had anything to do with it. 2. That his fame and deification followed in the steps of Heracles, his dux in caelum, if we may use this expression with a somewhat changed meaning.' 3. That Ennius did not originate his deification, but famae adsen- tiens, consummated it and established it in literature. That the fame of Romulus followed after that of Heracles, and that the stage for his deification was already set before the time when Ennius wrote his Annals may be seen from a Roman-Campanian coin of about the year 300 B.c., pictured in Roscher.2 The obverse of this coin has the head of Hercules, while on the reverse is shown the she-wolf suckling Romu- lus and Remus. Pertinent also is the statement of Julian 3 where Romulus gives a banquet in heaven; "for we are told that after Hera- cles Quirinus also ascended thither." Livy, I, 7, IO, is most important in this connection: Ubi nomen patremque ac patriam accepit (sc. Evander) "Iove nate, Hercules, salve," inquit, "te mihi mater, veridica interpres deorum, aucturum caelestium numerum cecinit tibique aram hic dicatum iri, quam opu- lentissima olim in terris gens maximam vocet tuoque ritu colat." The 1 Cf. Elter, op. cit., p. 40, 33: Also das Beispiel des in Rom verehrten, nun aber wieder hellenisierten Hercules hat den R6mern dazu verholfen, den Griander ihrer Stadt als Sohn eines Gottes zum Gotte zu erheben; und nicht einmal durch blosse Uebertragung der griechischen Auffassung des Hercules ist Romulus Gott geworden, sondern mit ausdrticklicher Anlehnung an die Person des Hercules.... Wie die fast stehende Verbindung des verg6tterten Romulus mit Hercules beweist, hat man auch Romulus von Anfang an als Gott sich nicht anders vorzu- stellen vermocht als mit Hercules zusammen, d.h. so, dass ihm wieder Hercules dux in caelum war, und wenn er dann weiter so ausser mit Hercules auch mit den Castores und Liber verbunden wird, so heisst dass wiederum nichts anderes, als dass er in ihre Gesellschaft aufgenommen wird, ein Gott wird oder vielmehr ein Halbgott wie sie es waren, nicht sowohl nach altr6mischer als vielmehr nach grie- chischer Auffassung. 2 Roscher's Lexikon, IV, 202, where other references also are given. 3 Caesares 307B.</page><page sequence="25">Heracles and his Successors 31 worship of Hercules graeco ritu established by Evander was continued by Romulus, and the forecasting of Hercules's deification is made the basis of Romulus's own immortality in section 15: Haec tum sacra Romulus una ex omnibus peregrina suscepit, iam turn immortalitatis virtute partae, ad quam eum sua fata ducebant, fautor. The identification of Romulus as a successor of Hercules was further helped by the fact that each was the mightier twin; and even as Her- acles had received Hebe, Romulus in becoming Quirinus carried Hersilia with him to a higher plane as Hora: Quirine pater veneror Horamque Quirini.1 Her deification is related by Ovid: 2 Hanc manibus notis Romanae conditor urbis Excipit, et priscum pariter cum corpore nomen 850 Mutat, Horamque vocat, quae nunc dea iuncta Quirino est. Thus post ingentia facta, beginning with the founding of the city, the city destined to become caput orbis terrarum,3 Romulus was deified and supplied with the requisite divine ancestry going back to Aphro- dite; but inasmuch as he was fourteen generations removed from Troy, the reinfusion of divine blood was supplied by Mars, god of war, as his father. It did not disturb the myth-makers that at the time of Romulus Mars was still a vegetation spirit. Thus his legend, starting with the fact that he was the founder of Rome, was expanded by agencies similar to those we have seen at work on Alexander, and astrologers constituted it in the form in which we find it in Plutarch, Rom. 12, 2 ff. SCIPIo AFRICANUS From the present writer's point of view the most valuable part of Elter's program, Donarem pateras, is that in which he considers the deification of Scipio. Wissowa has indeed accepted his general con- clusion so far as the deification is concerned, but the historians of literature have not been properly impressed with his conclusion as 1 Ennius, Ann. 117. 2 Ovid, Met. 14, 829 ft.; 849-51 are quoted above. Elter, however, did not estab- lish his position that it was Ennius who carried through the identification of Romu- lus with Quirinus; see Wissowa, Religion u. Kultus der Rimer (1912), p. 155, n. 5. 3 Livy, I, 16, 7-</page><page sequence="26">32 Andrew Runni Anderson affecting Ennius's Scipio.' Taking a suggestion from Horace2 in combination with evidence supplied by such writers as Cicero, Lac- tantius, and Silius Italicus he comes to the following conclusions: i. That Ennius, even as he had consummated the deification of Romulus, made an attempt to deify Scipio Africanus. 2. That the attempt to deify Scipio was made after he had been successful in deifying Romulus. 3. That the work in which the deification of Scipio was attempted was the Scipio and not the Annals. 4. The probability that the canon of demigods was established for later Roman writers by Ennius - Hercules, Dionysus, the Dioscuri, Romulus - without Asclepius and Alexander - and that Horace and Vergil, when they bring Augustus into this company, were following in the steps of Ennius. The attempt to deify Scipio was abortive, but such traces of it as are still extant show that those who constituted the legend considered him now as a new Hercules, now as a new Alexander. For example, his brilliant conduct in the Spanish campaigns includ- ing the capture of Carthago Nova and the spoils that these brought may have suggested comparison with Hercules. When this was sup- plemented by his victories over Hannibal and Antiochus, he very naturally became for this period the Roman representative to set over against Alexander. His scrupulous care to find out the will of the gods and his observance of all the formalities in ascertaining it, his frequent visits to the temple of Capitoline Jupiter at the end of night before daybreak - all this had the effect of making people think that he was in close communion with Jupiter.3 Furthermore, it might also suggest by way of comparison Alexander's high regard for the oracular utter- ances of Ammon and Alexander's alleged sonship to Ammon - a story that might easily react on the Roman popular belief so as to make Scipio actually the son of Jupiter. His mother's death in giving him 1 Teuffel, vol. 16 (I916) does not mention Elter's view at all. Schanz, I, ia (1907), came too early to consider Elter's conclusions. 2 Horace, C. IV, 8, I5 if. I Livy, 26, 19; Dio Cassius, 16, 39. Polybius, 10o, 2, 9, and Valerius Maximus, 1,2, I hold that Scipio in his close adherence to such religious forms was utterly insincere.</page><page sequence="27">Heracles and his Successors 33 birth also was given due interpretation in the construction of the legend. When after the peace with Antiochus both he and his brother were charged with malfeasance in office - a charge that may well have been due to private enmity and party politics - his name went under a cloud, and he retired from the people's gaze to Liternum. The public mind was ultimately left in uncertainty both as to the time and the place of his death - perhaps doubting whether he actually did die - and in confusion as to where he was really buried, if indeed he actually was buried anywhere.' Such are the speculations that grew up about his death, and as in the case of Alexander they provided the stuff out of which legends of deification are made. The chief passages dealing with his conception, birth, and his re- ligious practices are as follows: Gellius 6, I, I: Quod de Olympiade, Philippi regis uxore, Alexandri matre, in historia Graeca scriptum est, id de P. quoque Scipionis matre, qui prior Africanus appellatus est, memoriae datum est. nam et C. Oppius et Iulius Hyginus aliique, qui de vita et rebus Africani scripserunt, matrem eius diu sterilem existimatam tradunt, P. quoque Scipionem, cum quo nupta erat, liberos desperavisse. postea in cubiculo atque in lecto mulieris, cum absente marito cubans sola condormisset, visum repente esse iuxta eam cubare ingentem anguem eumque his qui viderant territis et claman- tibus elapsum inveniri non quisse. id ipsum P. Scipionem ad haruspices rettulisse, eos sacrificio facto respondisse fore ut liberi gignerentur, neque multis diebus, postquam ille anguis in lecto visus est, mulierem coepisse concepti fetus signa atque sensum pati. exinde mense decimo peperisse natumque esse hunc P. Africanum, qui Hannibalem et Carthaginienses in Africa bello Poenico secundo vicit. sed et eum inpendio magis ex rebus gestis, quam ex illo ostento virum esse virtutis divinae creditum est. 1 Livy, 38, 53,8: Silentium deinde de Africano fuit. vitam Literni egit sine deside- rio urbis: morientem rure eo ipso loco sepeliri se iussisse ferunt monumentumque ibi aedificari, ne funus sibi in ingrata patria fieret. Ibid., 38, 56, I ff.: Multa alia in Scipionis exitu maxime vitae dieque dicta, morte funere sepulcro, in diversum trahunt, ut, cui famae, quibus scriptis adsentiar, non habeam. non de accusatore convenit: alii M.

Livy 26, 19, 3 ff. Fuit enim Scipio non veris tantum virtutibus mirabilis, sed arte quoque quadam ab iuventa in ostentationem earum compositus, pleraque apud multitudinem aut per nocturnas visas aut species velut divinitus mente monita agens, sive et ipse capti quadam superstitione animi, sive ut imperia consiliaque velut sorte oraculi missa sine cunctatione exsequerentur. ad hoc iam inde ab initio praeparans animos, ex quo togam virilem sumpsit, nullo die prius ullam publicam privatamve rem egit, quam in Capitolium iret, ingressusque aedem consideret et plerumque solus in secreto ibi tempus tereret. hic mos, quem per omnem vitam ser- vabat, seu consulto seu temere vulgatae opinioni fidem apud quosdam fecit, ut stirpis eum divinae virum essfe crederent, rettulitque famam in Alexandro magno prius vulgatam, et vanitate et fabula parem, anguis immanis concubitu conceptum, et in cubiculo matris eius visam persaepe prodigii eius speciem interventuque hominum evolutam repente atque ex oculis elapsam. his miraculis numquam ab ipso elusa fides est, quin potius aucta arte quadam nec abnuendi tale quicquam nec palam adfir- mandi. multa alia eiusdem generis, alia vera, alia adsimulata, admirationis humanae in eo iuvene excesserant modum; quibus freta tunc civitas aetati haudquaquam maturae tantam rerum molem tantumque imperium permisit. Appian (Hisp. 23) adds the very interesting fact that even in his day in public processions they brought the image of Scipio alone out of the Capitol, all the others being taken from the Forum: Kal vtV eT T ?7P ELKvoa TP -r .itoKL7rWvo E'  7 -azisrot.LraZ~ o t pvOUv r fPOVLP EK 70pO KarLTrwXMov, TCOP 8' LXXwv P O ayopa W rpo4opovraLt. The treatment of Scipio in Lactantius, which goes back principally to Ennius and Cicero, is that of a successor of Hercules. Most striking is his statement in Div. Inst. ,9g: Hercules qui ob virtutem clarissimus et quasi Africanus inter deos habetur. In I, 18 the following statement is made: ille autem qui infinita milia hominum trucidarit ... non modo in templum sed etiam in caelum admittitur. apud Ennium sic loquitur Africanus: si fas endo plagas caelestum ascendere cuiquam est, mi soli caeli maxima porta patet,</page><page sequence="29">Heracles and his Successors 35 scilicet quia magnam partem generis humani extinxit ac perdidit. o in quantis tenebris, Africane, versatus es, vel potius o poeta qui per caedes et sanguinem patere hominibus ascensum in caelum puta- veris! cui vanitati etiam Cicero adsensit.' est vero, inquit, Africane, nam et Herculi eadem ista porta patuit, tamquam ipse plane cum id fieret ianitor fuerit in caelo. In his treatment of the legend of Scipio, Silius Italicus considers him mainly as a successor of Hercules. There are, it is true, some elements in it which the student of the legend must derive from the legend of Alexander, notably those relating to his conception.2 Silius, however, does not compare Pomponia to Olympias but brings her into fellowship with Alcmena and Leda, 13, 632-3. It is Mars who informs Scipio that Jupiter was his father, 4, 475-6: Macte, o macte indole sacra, Vera lovis proles. In 7, 487 (cf. 13, 625) his origin and future greatness are thus set forth: Hinc ille, e furto genitus, patruique piabit Idem ultor patrisque necem. Jupiter's passion was aroused by Venus, that thereby a champion of Rome might be born, who would defeat Juno's plan for a triumphant Carthage, 13, 615-620. Pomponia's conception is strikingly told, 13, 628 ff.: Excipit his mater: "Nullos, o nate, labores Mors habuit nostra: aethereo dum pondere partum Exsolvor, miti dextra Cyllenia proles 630 Imperio lovis Elysias deduxit in oras; Adtribuitque pares sedes, ubi magna moratur Alcidae genitrix, ubi sacro munere Leda.

Sed mihi post partum non ultra ducere vitam Concessum: heu, quantum gemui, quod spiritus ante, Haec tibi quam noscenda darem, discessit in auras." The Herculean succession, however, is most clearly brought out in what we may call Scipio in Bivio, when Voluptas and Virtus appear before him and he has to make his choice between them. Most signi- ficant are the words of Virtus, answering Voluptas, 15, 69 ff.: "Quasnam iuvenem florentibus, inquit, Pellicis in fraudes annis, vitaeque tenebras, Cui ratio, et magnae caelestia semina mentis Munere sunt concessa deum? Mortalibus alti Quantum caelicolae, tantundem animalibus isti Praecellunt cunctis, tribuit namque ipsa minores Hos terris natura deo: sed foedere certo 75 Degeneres tenebris animas damnavit Avernis.

It is only in the late republic that we find the basis of deification and immortality expressed by Cicero: 1 Neque enim est ulla res in qua propius ad deorum numen virtus accedat humana, quam civi- tates aut condere novas aut conservare conditas. Also:2 omnibus qui patriam conservarint, adiuverint, auxerint, certum esse in caelo definitum locum, ubi beati aevo sempiterno fruantur; nihil est enim illi I De Rep. 1, 7, 12. 2 Ibid., 6, 13.</page><page sequence="31">Heracles and his Successors 37 principi deo, qui omnem mundum regit, quod quidem in terris fiat, ac- ceptius quam concilia coetusque hominum iure sociata, quae civitates appellantur; harum rectores et conservatores hinc profecti huc rever- tuntur. This, says Cumont, is the republican paraphrase of the divin- ity of kings. In a noble passage Cicero I actually cites Hercules's con- duct as the prototype of virtus made immortal: cogitemus denique corpus virorum fortium magnorum hominum esse mortale, animi vero motus et virtutis gloriam sempiternam; neque hanc opinionem si in illo sanctissimo Hercule consecratam videmus, cuius corpore ambusto vitam eius et virtutem immortalitas excepisse dicatur, minus existime- mus eos qui hanc tantam rem publicam suis consiliis aut laboribus aut auxerint aut defenderint aut servarint esse immortalem gloriam consecutos. Beginning with the last century of the republic, however, the suc- cessors of Hercules are likely to be more and more composite. The civil disturbances that began with the Gracchi reared a set of giants or monsters, the quelling of which called for a new Jupiter or a new Hercules or both. The age called for a Hercules to bring peace to a warworn world; to discover or to invent an institution that would put an end to both the usurpations of the senate, exercised mostly in the passing of the senatus consultum ultimum, and the excesses of the populace, and this device we know now was legalized absolutism. POMPEY It was during the Roman conquests in the East, beginning with the Mithradatic wars, that her great generals began to visualize them- selves, or to be visualized by their constituency, as followers of Her- cules or of Alexander or of both. Such was Lucullus, but the earliest striking instance is Pompey the Great, as the following quotation from Pliny, N. H. 7, 95-99, shows: Verum ad decus imperii Romani, non solum ad viri unius pertinet, victoriarum Pompei Magni titulos omnes triumphosque hoc in loco nuncupari aequato non solum Alex- andri Magni rerum fulgore, sed etiam Herculis prope ac Liberi Patris. (Then follows a number of valuable details.) 99. summa summarum in illa gloria fuit, ut ipse in contione dixit, cum de rebus suis dissereret, 1 Pro Sestio, 143.</page><page sequence="32">38 Andrew Runni Anderson Asiam ultimam provinciarum accepisse eandemque mediam patriae reddidisse. His remarkable record of triumphs obtained for achievements in Africa, Europe, and Asia made the comparison with Hercules obvious.' Indeed the lex Gabinia 2 supplemented by the lex Manilia gave him control of the world. Appian 3 tells us how he was interested in the lands made memorable by the Argonauts, the Dioscuri, and Hercules. He was pleased to find in this general region warriors that could be classified as Amazons,4 thus following in the footsteps of Hercules, and of Alexander. Alexander's meeting with the Amazons rests on rather questionable authority.5 Plutarch opens his biography of Pompey with a rather labored comparison to the effect that what Hercules was to Prometheus, Pompey 6 was to the Roman people - both were saviours. It is interesting to note that at Pharsalus 7 the watchword of the Pompeians was Hercules invictus over against Venus victrix of the Caesarians. The Romans seem to have been much given to likening Pompey to Alexander. To both they gave the surname Magnus.

In his triumph, which he celebrated as he turned his forty-fifth year, he wore the cloak reputed to be that of Alexander the Great.3 As early as the time of the agitation of the Gabinian law, the parallel was invoked that such concentration of power meant the creation of a new Romulus, and Plutarch4 tells us the following: KaL 7TC IvPV virc- TOV &amp;Tepos diroV Arp I IV, eTt 'P Xoplo -p o ? 05 Erat Ta'-rb TW aTEPOS EtrCoW wpos avrov, oTL , PwyThXOv WX V o1V EOEPatrcrz KE 'XLV TiXOS, KLV~iVEU(EV uir6O7rT 70o rrXouo 8LaOap~Va. CAESAR The next to essay the r61le of the new Heracles was Julius Caesar. There is not even a story of his birth that sets aside his human father, and makes him the immediate son of a god, as there was in the case of Hercules, Alexander, Romulus, and Scipio. He knew full well that he could become the new Heracles in the form of the king-god, only through the performance of conspicuous service to his fellowmen. Let me by anticipation recall that among other distinctions he caused a statue of himself to be set up with the inscription INVICTO DEO in the temple of Quirinus,5 a situation that drew from Cicero 6 the bitter remark that he preferred to have him placed in the temple of Quirinus rather than in that of Salus, implying the hope that like Romulus he might be torn limb from limb by the senators rather than 1 Plut., Pomp. 38. 2 Plut., Pomp. 46. 3 Appian, Mithr.

But the composite picture compels us to consider him also as the successor of Heracles-Alexander. As a lad he wrote the Laudes Her- culis, which Suetonius 1 tells us was one of his minor works, the publi- cation of which Augustus forbade in a frank letter to the organizer of his libraries, Pompeius Macer. Suetonius 2 tells us further that while quaestor in Further Spain ubi... Gadis... venisset, animadversa apud Herculis templum Magni Alexandri imagine ingemuit et quasi pertaesus ignaviam suam, quod nihil dum a se memorabile actum esset in aetate, qua iam Alexander orbem terrarum subegisset, mis- sionem continuo efflagitavit ad captandas quam primum rerum occa- siones in urbe.3 It must be admitted that he made heroic progress. Strabo 4 tells us that he was LXaXkc'av3pos and that he went through the same ceremonies that Alexander had performed at Troy. The Alexander Romance 5 tells of a Delphic oracle prophesying world dominion to whomsoever could ride the wild horse, Bucephalas, and that Alexander succeeded in riding him. Suetonius 6 tells of a similar prophecy involving Caesar: cum haruspices imperium orbis terrae significare domino pronuntiassent, magna cura aluit, nec patien- tem sessoris alterius primus ascendit; cuius etiam instar pro aede Veneris Genetricis postea dedicavit. Of this Statius 7 gives another version, Cedat equus, Latiae qui contra templa Diones Caesarei stat sede fori - quem traderis ausus Pellaeo, Lysippe, duci, mox Caesaris ora Mirata cervice tulit - 1 Suetonius, Julius 56, 7. 2 Suetonius, Julius 7. This incident seems to have been in Julian's mind when he wrote Caesares, 322C. 3 Caesar as aorrop has been treated by Wendland, op. cit., pp. 342 ff. Strabo, 13, I, 27. In Julian, Caesares, 322B Alexander claims Caesar as an imitator of himself; he also remarks testily, 322C, that Caesar had come to such a pitch of shamelessness as actually to ridicule the model of his own exploits, and that at most the Romans had made only scant progress beyond the Tigris, 324C. 5 Alex.

This would indeed make Caesar a successor of Alexander! Finally the whole Roman world lay at his feet. Technically the defeat of Crassus at Carrhae needed to be avenged. Really Caesar sought to be named rex,1 and to proceed against the Parthians was to follow the steps of Alexander. After the conquest of the Far East Caesar's plan seems to have been what Plutarch 2 has related in his life of him: T 'l / d7re oS ~ o3&amp;v v ErrEpov ' iXos a broi3 KaOl6rep XXov K1at tXOVCK1CL rLs VlrEp TCW /LEXXvrWV 7Wrpo -r 7r Erpw-pyiva, 7rCpaCGKEV'?7 ?E KatL YV w/l crparTEL v ' '' A7rL IdtpOoVS, Ka7rarpE?ayIIVq 3 TotoS KCl L' 'aTpKavlas rapd 7rTv Karlav OdatXaoav Kal rvY Ka1'oKGaOV K7rEPLEXOO6VT rTv IIbVrov Es TV 2; KVOLK?'7V t'-aXE^TV KL ra ElrApXOpa 1FEpIavoZ Kal IFEpyavlcav ibr)v ElrLpayLvrtL L&amp;t KEXTrjv E'7ravEXOEV Et'vP lTCXaV KaL tivv'?atTWV r KVKXOV TOTOVy T7q ?sf yEovtas~ C 7 ravraXOaEV 'KEac WEptoptoLO6ELcJ. Had this plan been carried out, he would have been not only the son of Mars and Venus and the reincarnation of Romulus and the heir of the world empire prophesied to his descendants, but he would have equalled the remotest travels of Heracles and realized the wildest dreams of Alexander, and on the completion of these designs his deifi- cation would have followed as a matter of course. But the Ides of March ended these aspirations. However, the failure of his enemies to secure the passage of a decree of damnatio memoriae against his name and record prepared the way for the confirmation of all his acts, which with his successors became synonymous with consecration. Instead of the funeral pyre erected in the Campus Martius near the tomb of Julia, fate intervened and improvised a pyre in the Forum on which his mortal parts were consumed, the immortal part of him presumably ascending to heaven - a true successor of Heracles and Hephaestion. And further, Suetonius 3 tells us that Siquidem ludis, quos primos consecrato ei heres Augustus edebat, stella crinita per 1 Plutarch, Lysander, 26, tells of a somewhat similar device resorted to by Ly- sander to seize power. 2 Plutarch, Caesar 58. 3 Suet., Jul. 88.</page><page sequence="36">42 Andrew Runni Anderson septem continuos dies fulsit exoriens circa undecimam horam, credi- tumque est animam esse Caesaris in caelum recepti; et hac de causa simulacro eius in vertice additur stella. The star in the death scene of Alexander in the Alexander Romance 1 will be remembered in this connection, and also the star in the St. Petersburg cameo,2 and so symbolically as well Caesar is the successor of Alexander. ANTONY Among the followers of Julius Caesar Mark Antony should be men- tioned as one who essayed to play the r6le of successor to Heracles and Alexander. I say "essayed," because his succession to these two characters was limited to imitating them superficially; of their deep and fundamental significance he seems to have had no real grasp. He was also a successor of Dionysus as stated below. In the first place he claimed descent from Anton, a son of Heracles; " it doubtless flattered him that the people thought that his features bore a resemblance to those of Heracles in his statues and paintings, and in the passage cited, Plutarch informs us that he tried to dress in keeping with the r6le. He pointed with pride to the example of Heracles, by whom his own ancestor was begotten, as one who did not confine his succession to a single womb, but gave free course to nature, thereby leaving,behind him the beginnings and foundations of many families.4 This was said by him in justification of the legitimization of Alexander and Cleopatra, his children by Cleopatra.' We are told 6 that it was Fulvia who tamed Mark Antony to endure a woman's sway, and that to her Cleopatra should have been properly grateful for having trained him so thoroughly to subservience. Indeed we are told 7 that "Antony, like Heracles in paintings where Omphale is seen taking away his club, and stripping off his lion's skin, was often dis- armed by Cleopatra, subdued by her spells, etc." But the blunt energy and rugged honesty of Heracles were wanting. 1 3, 34; Ovid, Met. 15, 843 ff. 2 Furtwdingler, Antike Gemmen, vol.

I Plut., Comp. of Dem. and Ant. 3.</page><page sequence="37">Heracles and his Successors 43 His succession to Alexander, however, is less remote and more sig- nificant, although in imitating Heracles he was to a certain extent imitating Alexander. For example, even as Alexander had named his son by Barsine Heracles, so Antony named his son by Cleopatra Alex- ander. Of the two r6les of succession played by Alexander - Heracles and Dionysus - the former has already been treated. The other r61e played by Alexander, that of Dionysus, was really more congenial to Antony.' Significant too are the portents that occurred before the defeat at Actium.2 "In Patras, while Antony was staying there, the Heracleium was struck by lightning; and at Athens the Dionysus in the Battle of the Giants was dislodged by the winds and carried down into the theatre. Now, Antony associated himself with Heracles in his lineage, and with Dionysus in the mode of life which he adopted, as I have said,3 and he was called the new Dionysus." That he regarded himself as the successor of Alexander, quartered in Alexandria, but ruling actually or potentially over the whole of what had been Alexan- der's empire is indicated by the symbolic ceremonies described by Plutarch,4 a chapter full of significance: EzrX o-as yp 6XXov r6 Y'U 4- Towv KaL OEpelos rti pl3jlaros apyvpo 8bvo Op6vovu Xpvwo0sv, 76v .EP Eavrw ir6v 3U KXeoird~7pa, KaL roFS IraLtlv rEpovs TaTretYoTrpovs, irpWTov pLy ar-qVPe KXEoircirpav actiX wav Alybrrov Kai Ka i Krpov Kal AtOVis Kal KoLAnXl ZvpLas, o3vy0aCo-LXEbo7-ro ab,,-j KaLCaplwpos, 6S 'K Kaloapos E&amp;6KEL 70i -rpo-r.pov /yeyovp'catL KXEor07Tpav EYKVO Karao rb'?ro s-6Ebrepop U roVis '4 ab'ro0 Ki KXEorrpus vuois facLXE^s pafrct'wv avayopEvaas, 'AXE?Wvipcp ypy 'ApyEia laie'VEL/.

Here doubtless it would be gathered to that of Alexander and his Suc- cessors. AUGUSTUS The succession of Augustus to Heracles and to the other demigods who are sometimes grouped together in a canon is made clear by the following quotations from Horace: C. 3, 14,I if.: Herculis ritu modo dictus, 0 Plebs, Morte venalem petiisse laurum, Caesar Hispana repetit Penates Victor ab ora. C. 3, 3, 9 ff.: Hac arte Pollux et vagus Hercules Enisus arcis attigit igneas Quos inter Augustus recumbens Purpureo bibit (or bibet) ore nectar. Hac te merentem, Bacche pater, tuae Vexere tigres, indocili iugum Collo trahentes; hac Quirinus 2 Martis equis Acheronta fugit. Epp. 2, I, 5 ff.: Romulus et Liber pater et cum Castore Pollux Post ingentia facta deorum in templa recepti, Ploravere suis non respondere favorem 9 Speratum meritis. Diram qui contudit hydram Notaque fatali portenta labore subegit, Comperit invidiam supremo fine domari. that the concept Alexander-Helius is a new one. This is of course by no means the case. See Schreiber, Studien iiber das Bildnis Alexanders d. Grossen, pp. 124 f. We could wish that the information concerning Alexander-Helius were fuller. 1 Plut., Ant. 58. 2 Augustus as a successor of Romulus has been fully treated by Kenneth Scott, The Identification of Augustus with Romulus-Quirinus, in Trans. Am. Phil. Assn., LVI (1925), pp. 82 ff.</page><page sequence="39">Heracles and his Successors 45 C. 4, 5, 31 ff.: (addressed to Augustus): Hinc ad vina redit laetus et alteris Te mensis adhibet deum; Te multa prece, te prosequitur mero Defuso pateris et Laribus tuum Miscet numen, uti Graecia Castoris Et magni memor Herculis.1 No argument is needed to interpret the pertinent features of these passages: the traditional ov-crpes together with their conspicuous services to humanity are given, and to their number Augustus is added, as being really more blessed than any one of them in not having to wait until after death for the guerdon of deification. The absence of the name of Alexander is significant, and will be considered later in connection with similar passages to be cited. CIL. XIV. 3665, 3681, 3679, 3679a show that at Tibur the cult of Augustus was joined directly to that of Hercules; likewise at Gru- mentum, CIL. X, 320.2 Oceanus and the Cosmic Serpent. Inasmuch as this paper includes the study of its several heroes in their capacity as KoO-poKp Aropes, the symbolism of Oceanus and the cosmic serpent is herewith presented in its main phases. In Homer's description of the shield of Achilles the River Oceanus encircles the outermost rim of the shield, thus including all the activities pictured within it, and symbolically inclosing the orbis terrarum, Iliad I8, 607-8: v 3S' "ieL' -'rorcaoo ,u"ya oe6vos 'MKeavo'to vvrycya rap' rv~Id77v AKEOs 7rbKtKa o7troto. Oceanus is found in a similar position and with the same symbolical significance in Hesiod's description of the shield of Heracles, Aspis 314-5: 1 Here should be added Tacitus, Ann. 4, 38, 5, where the senate views with disfavor Tiberius's refusal to be deified: Optimos quippe mortalium altissima cupere: sic Herculem et Liberum apud Graecos, Quirinum apud nos deum numero additos, melius Augustum, qui speravit. In Horace, C. i, 12, the demigods are not so clearly distinguished. 2 For the Roman emperors after Augustus who were identified with Hercules see Peter in Roscher's Lexicon, I, 2987 ff.</page><page sequence="40">46 Andrew Runni Anderson iTVf' tE I ?QKEcLZ'O WXap O77 L EOLKWl C . waP 6~Eo'VZ tXE oLKOS W3OX4Clvat&amp;aXOp. Oceanus resembling a serpent was thus easily merged with the oriental conception of the cosmic serpent. When the world was represented as flat, the serpent would like Oceanus encircle the outer edge; when the world came to be represented and symbolized by a sphere, the serpent would be represented as encircling the terrestrial globe or the cosmic sphere. In either representation, however, the cosmic serpent symbolized world dominion. I cite therefore the Alex. Rom. I, ii: pPs 0ETpo0C Eo P0Td SrotS KbXTOUS acLroV (sc. ftXrrov) 'XXoAY ?74 - KEy &amp;O6Z, 0 KaCaKLToLKVXL(O E 7F S T Y7 S y0K ppc-y-7. o4 01 E7W7s7ysT7o /yLtKpqV 8paKO'TtLOZ' KVKX^capY 6 6T -6'y, 66WE' E0XGE, Kcll 7EXOEJ f6ovX6ob'Eoz', rpil /a3XEVY OU 7ryT KEcaX7 ETE77ET?~E7V. . . .

To this should be added the passage from the Syrian version, I, 30, quoted on p. 21. Similarly, when Alexander makes his celestial voyage, he sees the Ocean like a serpent serving as the outer boundary of the world; 2, 41 in L and C; Leo Neap. III, 27 II, 5 Pfister. If we pass to our Roman heroes, Pompey sought to bring his vic- torious career of conquest in touch with the Ocean (Plut. Pomp. 38, quoted on p. 39), and Plutarch credits a similar goal to Caesar (Caes. 58, quoted on p. 41). Herewith should be compared Verg. Aen. i, 286-7:1 Nascetur pulcra Troianus origine Caesar, Imperium Oceano, famam qui terminet astris. On the patera of Boutae, in the centre of which is found the portrait of Augustus, the cosmic serpent passes around close to the edge, in- closing all the details represented.2 1 Recent editors refer this to Augustus rather than to Julius. See however Gun- dolf, Caesar, Berlin, 1924, P. 26. 2 Deonna, Le Tresor des Fins d'Annecy in Rev. Arch. IX(1920), pp. 126, i3off. Deonna calls attention to the serpent encircling the sphere in the deification of Antoninus and Faustina, and to the article 'Sterne' in Roscher. I have added these instances from the Alexander Romance and from Pompey and Caesar.</page><page sequence="41">Heracles and his Successors 47 The child of Vergil's Fourth Eclogue is one of the successors of Heracles. In the light of Norden's brilliant book, Die Geburt des Kindes, which has treated the many-sided significance of that inspired work, I hope that I may not be regarded as utterly presumptuous in bringing forward my own opinions concerning its setting and inter- pretation, some of which had occurred to me before reading his book, while again others have been suggested by it. I still feel with Skutsch and many other scholars that it is preferable to regard Horace's Six- teenth Epode as having stimulated Vergil to the writing of the Eclogue, and that it was Vergil's optimism that supplied the hope amid the gloom. Horace had counselled withdrawal to the far off isles of the western ocean, where presumably the Golden Age was thought still to persist without degeneration; Vergil found it expedient to foretell a restoration of it to the land of Saturn. But the Eclogue was more remotely an answer also to Catullus 1 in whom he had read: Currite ducentes subtegmina, currite fusi. a line of which the author of the Ciris,2 whether Vergil or some one else, had already shown reminiscence: Concordes stabili firmarunt numine Parcae, etc., and which is reflected also in Ecl. 4, 46-7: "Talia saecla" suis dixerunt "currite" fusis Concordes stabili fatorum numine Parcae. In fact the Eclogue rings like a solemn correction or even rebuke to the thought found at the end of Catullus's poem, especially the con- cluding lines, 404 f .: Omnia fanda nefanda malo permixta furore lustificam nobis mentem avertere deorum, Quare nec talis dignantur visere coetus, Nec se contingi patiuntur lumine claro. But Vergil, instead of granting that the gods had permanently with- drawn from participation in the human affairs of this crime-ridden world, was strong in his hope for a return of the virgin Astraea and of the Golden Age. The closing line of the Eclogue: 1 Catullus, 64, 327. 2 Ciris, 125.</page><page sequence="42">48 Andrew Runni Anderson qui non risere parenti, Nec deus hunc mensa, dea nec dignata cubili est, is more obviously to be interpreted as a reminiscence of Homer, Od. II, 6oi f.:' r6v b etr' Ei6eo77a /3077bv 'HpaKX77?'1t77V, -rprrECt 'v OaCXhq3 Kacl EXEL KCaXXocQvpOV "Hf3p'. and prepares us to think of the coming saviour in terms of a new Heracles. But after all Vergil's closest contacts were with Theocritus. The picture of Alexander and Ptolemy Soter exalted to heaven as paladins of Heracles in 17, 13-33, could not fail to have impressed him, when he penned such lines as 15 ff.: Ille deum vitam accipiet, divisque videbit Permixtos heroas et ipse videbitur illis, Pacatumque reget patriis virtutibus orbem. But even closer to the Fourth Eclogue than the Seventeenth Idyll is the Twenty-fourth Idyll entitled "Heracliscus." In this, after the ten months' babe, Heracles, has strangled the serpents, Tiresias utters the prophecy (79 ff., already quoted on p. io above) foretelling the age of idyllic peace - almost a Golden Age - that the Hero was to bring to pass on earth. The motif of the Tierfriede sounded by Theocritus in 90o-9 Vergil utilized as early as Ecl. 5, 6o0: Nec lupus insidiae pecori nec retia cervis Ulla dolum meditantur, a passage that probably antedates Horace, Epode, 16, 31-34 (cf. also Ecd. 8, 27). But in the Fourth Eclogue Vergil essayed paulo maiora. Instead of foretelling the training, achievements, and deification of the babe Heracles ex eventu, as Theocritus did, he made a prophecy of one (presumably) not yet born, one who by the way has never been satis- factorily identified, for the reason that no babe born near to that time 1 Norden, op. cit., p. 68, cites three similar passages from Pindar.: N. I, 69; I, 3 (4), 58; I., 5 (6), 24. 2 The same view was put forth by Kukula, Rim. Sdkularpoesie. Reinach in the Rev. de l'histoire des Religions, XLII, p. 365 ff. explained the puer as the son of Jupiter appearing as the new Dionysus.</page><page sequence="43">Heracles and his Successors 49 brought Vergil's prophecy to fulfillment. He who restored Astraea and the Golden Age proved to be none other than Augustus himself, and Augustus trod in the steps of Heracles, of Alexander, not to mention Romulus and Caesar; and the empire that Augustus founded was one conceived along messianic lines and it was the realization of the ideal of Alexander. The signs attending the birth of the child would be in keeping with his high destiny, lines 50 ff.: Aspice convexo nutantem pondere mundum Terrasque tractusque maris caelumque profundum, Aspice venturo ut laetentur omnia saeclo. What have the scenes at the birth of Heracles and Alexander to com- pare with this? At the birth of Heracles described at the end of Plau- tus, Amphitruo, which clearly took place at night, we find the maid Bromia thus describing what happened, 1055 ff.: ita mihi videntur omnia, mare terra caelum consequi, lo63 strepitus, crepitus, sonitus, tonitrus; ut subito, ut propere ut valide tonuit! 1o87 ardere censui aedes; ita tum confulgebant; and the latter thought is repeated at 1094 ff.: tum ibi continuo contonat sonitu maximo, aedis primo ruere rebamur tuas. aedes totae confulgebant tuae, quasi essent aureae. When Jupiter in line 1123 has announced that it is his son who has killed the serpents,-- whereat Amphitruo sets out to consult Tiresias, Jupiter actually makes his epiphany and says, 139 ff.: Eorum alter, nostro quist susceptust semine, suis factis te immortali adficiet gloria. Note that Jupiter modestly passes on the glory of the achieving such a son to Amphitruo. Such a scene as this supplied the groundwork for the description of the birth of Alexander in the Alexander Romance, and in this con- nection let me recall what has been set forth above, namely, that the author of the Alexander Romance portrayed his hero in the main as</page><page sequence="44">50 Andrew Runni Anderson a second Heracles. First, let me quote the Latin version of Julius Valerius, I, xii (6), Nectanebus: Ac tum demum acrius intuens cursus astrorum motusque elementorum cognoscit iam omnem mundum vim suam in summo culmine conversionis lene librasse solemque ipsum mediam caeli plagam et convexi celsiora percurrere. Tunc ergo ad mulierem sic ait: "En tempus est," inquit, "voce nunc fortiore opus est et obfirmatiore conatu, quippe quod nunc erit editum, mundi totius dominio celebrabitur." His femina incitata mugitu omni vehe- mentius ingemiscens exegit puerum, qui ubi ad humum lapsus est, motus protinus terrae insequitur et tonitruum crepor ventorumque conflictus, tum etiam fulgorum coruscatio; prorsus ut viseres omni mundo curam cum illa partitudine elaboratam.1 Finally there is the pivotal line of the whole poem, 49: Cara deum suboles, magnum Iovis incrementum, with which should be closely compared Ciris, 398: Cara Iovis suboles, magnum Iovis incrementum, here referring to the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux. In each line the first part is perfectly clear; for in the passage from the Ciris the Dioscuri are clearly the sons of Jupiter, whereas in the Eclogue the poet is non-committal by his use of deum. Before proceeding to the discussion of the second part of the line let me observe that in the pagan world of Greece and Rome the highest goal that could be hoped for was that one's achievement would be so great that by common consent the performer would be spoken of as the offspring of a god, and that in recognition of this he would be added as a new deity to the ranks of the Olympians. It is unfortunate that the phrase, magnum lovis incrementum, has often been translated "great seed of a Jupiter to be." This is the interpretation of the great scholar, Munro, who arrived at it through what cannot now be regarded as anything else than the forcing of the parallel, Ovid Met. 3, 102: Vipereos dentes, populi incrementa futuri, 1 I have not been able to see, except in reviews and summaries, Boll's discussion of these astrological elements found in his Sulla quarta ecloga di Virgilio, in Mem. Acad. Bologna, 1923. The B Manuscript represents Alexander as born by night. In the others the sun is at its zenith jecovpavw3p. In the Armenian, the birth takes place under Kp6vos; in A and Syrian the signs are Aquarius and Pisces under which Zeus, Ammon, Bel, and Dionysus also were born.</page><page sequence="45">Heracles and his Successors 51 an expression used of the dragon's teeth, and Curtius 5, 6, 42; magno- rum praefectorum et ducum haec sunt incrementa et rudimenta, an ex- pression used of the sons of the Macedonian chieftains.- To interpret the Dioscuri of the Ciris or the babe of the Fourth Eclogue as embryo Jupiters would entail an over-production of Jupiters, and create a situation utterly abhorrent to any proper conception of Jupiter, as for example given by Horace, C. I, 12, 17 ff.: Unde nil maius generatur ipso, Nec viget quicquam simile aut secundum. Norden 2 has given a good discussion of the semantics of incrementum; Anwuchs, Zuwachs, Wachstum, Nachwachs, and he correctly cites augmentum as synonymous with incrementum. Augmentum may be an increase produced by generation, i.e., offspring, scion, and it may equally well be an addition made to any thing or quality; and herewith I cite several passages from Julius Valerius, p. io, 22 Kuebl.- sed enim Antiphon ad incrementum peritiae suae; 45, 21 non ut opibus suis indidem incrementi aliquid pareretur; 53, o10 quin ergo errata corrige nec addas facinoribus huiusmodi incrementum; 62, 14, quippe (Darius) illum incrementis bellicae rei audiebat quotidie sublimari; 86, 22, tot victoriis doctus nil aliud nisi de incremento vestrae gloriae cogitaverim. In view of such usages as these, I may well raise the question whether in CIL. X, I, pp. 58o-8i: ex quorum reditu quotannis daretur pueris, curiae incrementis, should be translated as Mayor 3 suggests "boys who would hereafter constitute (or compose) the town council," or "boys who are the offspring of decurions" (Frank),4 but rather "boys who would hereafter be added to the town council." My own conclusion is in harmony with the last suggestion, and is identical with that of Skutsch,5 who interprets incrementum lovis as an accession to Jupiter, or, more concretely, one who supports him in his work, and is therefore destined to be added to the ranks of the dwellers on Olympus by deification, and this whether he might be the son of Jupiter, as 1 See the edition of Mtitzell and his note ad loc. 2 Norden, op. cit., p. 129 f. 3 Mayor, Virgil's Messianic Eclogue, p. 139. 4 Frank, Class. Phil. XI (1916), 334 f. 6 Skutsch, Gallus u. Vergil, p. 82.</page><page sequence="46">52 Andrew Runni Anderson were Heracles, Dionysus, the Dioscuri, or the son of Apollo, as was Augustus. And in view of such considerations we should not (with Robinson Ellis) cite as parallel Aen. 9, 642: dis genite et geniture deos, but rather Aen. 8, 301 (words addressed by Evander to Hercules): Salve vera lovis proles, decus addite divis. And the same idea, that is, of an addition made to the divine ranks, perhaps a reminiscence of the last passage just quoted from Vergil and of line 49 of the Eclogue, is to be found in Livy, i, 7, io, which also are Evander's words to Hercules: love nate Hercules, inquit, te mihi mater veridica interpres deum, aucturum caelestium numerum cecinit. With reference therefore to the puer this study accepts the view of Kukula 1 that he was conceived after the fashion of Heracles and Alex- ander, and that incrementum means augmentum or accession, as first suggested by Skutsch. For nearly a decade after the Peace of Brundisium and the Fourth Eclogue the Roman world waited in vain for its saviour and world- ruler, but with the issue of Actium it found both in Octavian, soon to be named Augustus. The consummation of these great events finds its expression in Vergil's triumphant lines, Aen. 6, 791 ff.: Hic vir, hic est, tibi quem promitti saepius audis, Augustus Caesar, Divi genus, aurea condet Saecula qui rursus Latio regnata per arva Saturno quondam; super et Garamantas et Indos Proferet imperium; iacet extra sidera tellus, Extra anni solisque vias, ubi caelifer Atlas Axem umero torquet stellis ardentibus aptum.

Silius Italicus seems to have had this Vergilian passage in mind when he introduced Alexander, 13, 762 ff.: Hic ille est, tellure vagus qui victor in omni Cursu signa tulit, cui pervia Bactra Dahaeque, Qui Gangen bibit et Pellaeo ponte Niphaten Adstrinxit, cui stant sacro sua moenia Nilo. Even in the rhetorical field there are a few points on which Norden's argument can be supplemented. It was a rhetorical necessity that a writer of a oTiyKplas: should make out his hero to be superior to the heroes of former times to whom he compared him. Thus Lucretius at the beginning of the Fifth Book represents Epicurus 2 as having con- 1 E. Norden in Rhein. Mus. LIV (1899), p. 468 ff. Norden's view has been ac- cepted by Kampers, op. cit., p. 42-2; W. Hoffmann, Literarische Portrat, p. 33-5; H. Christensen, Alexander der grosse bei den rdmischen Dichtern, in Neue Jahrbaicher f.d. klassische Altertum, XXIII (1909) pp. 107 ff.; Kukula in his Rimische Sakular- poesie; it has been rejected by Elter, op. cit., p. 40, 42 and 40, 52. In pure formal- ism - which was based on Roman native pride and the fiction of their descent, especially that of the Julii from Romulus, Mars, Aeneas and Venus - Elter is of course right, but in historical reality he is wrong. Augustus was the successor of both Romulus and Alexander. Gundolf, Caesar, p. 26, says "Man gehorchte dem Augustus, man trdiumte von Alexander ... man opferte dem Divus Julius." Augustus's appreciation of Alexander was most genuine. With Vergil's omission of the name Alexander and the substitution of Augustus therefor may be compared the act of Claudius in having the head of Augustus substituted for that of Alexander in the two paintings mentioned by Pliny, N.H. 35, 92-94: (Apelles) pinxit Alexan- drum magnum fulmen tenentem in Templo Ephesiae Dianae . . . digiti eminere videntur et fulmen extra tabulam esse ... mirantur eius ... Romae Castorem et Pollucem cum Victoria et Alexandro Magno, item Belli imaginem restrictis a tergo manibus, Alexandro in curru triumphante, quas utrasque tabulas divus Augustus in fori sui celeberrimis partibus dicaverat simplicitate moderata divus Claudius pluris existimavit utrique excisa Alexandri facie divi Augusti imagines addere. 2 On Epicurus as the recipient of divine honors both during his lifetime and after, see Wendland, op. cit., p. 346 if., especially notes 3 and 4; Deneken in Roscher I, 2, col. 2534 f.</page><page sequence="48">54 Andrew Runni Anderson tributed greater benefits on the human race than Hercules, and in our passage under discussion Vergil represents Augustus as having traversed a greater area of the earth than did either Hercules or Diony- sus. Quite innocently these authors were preparing the way for avyKpiOEtS to be made a century later in which Martial compares Domitian with Hercules to the great disadvantage of the latter, in fact our hero becomes Alcides minor, and the statue of him set up in his temple by Domitian was made in representation of the emperor's features.' In like manner Statius, Silvae, 4, 3, 153 ff.: luravit tibi iam nivalis Arctus, Nunc magnos Oriens dabit triumphos, Ibis qua vagus Hercules et Euhan Ultra sidera flammeumque solem Et Nili caput et nives Atlantis, etc. Where Augustus is represented as having gone extra sidera, extra anni solisque vias (795-6), Q. Curtius represents the soldiers of Alexander as refusing trahi extra sidera et solem cogique adire, quae mortalium oculis natura subduxerit, etc. (9, 4, 18).2 In the funeral oration in honor of Augustus which Dio Cassius puts in the mouth of Tiberius is found the following interesting aibyKpt0w: ETrEf5 6' rt,~LpovXev0PTOs ac9TO (sc.

It has become recognized within the past generation that the Roman empire was in essence the realization of the ideal of Alexander. The Romans knew well that they were his political and cultural heirs, even though they did not specifically say so. In fact they realized it so fully that they spoke of themselves as though they were his geo- graphical heirs as well. This is the reason that in imperial literature we find such terms as Medi, Persi, Indi, Seres used. In our editions of the classical authors the notes tell us that these are general terms for eastern or oriental; they do not however tell us that these terms would hardly have been used then had it not been for Alexander and his cult - the aspiration of the Roman emperors to grow up to his stature. The extreme instance of this hyperbole is to be found in Servius, ad Aen. I, 292: nam cum de Gangaridum victoria diceret (sc. Vergilius) qui iuxta Gangen sunt et ab Augusto victi sunt.2 Strangely enough Augustus, who arose as the new Heracles, and as the champion of Italy in the form of the deified Romulus, was also the successor of Alexander and a votary of the new Alexander cult. He spared Alexandria, and visited reverently the tomb of Alexander, placing upon it a golden crown and flowers. The Ptolemies he did not wake from their slumbers, suffering them to rest on in peace, saying that he desired to see a king, not corpses.3 He caused two paintings of Alexander by Apelles to be placed conspicuously in the Forum, on both of which Claudius later caused the head of Alexander to be re- placed by that of Augustus.4 At one period he employed the image of Alexander on his seal;5 and even as Alexander received embassies from the peoples of the West on his return from the far East to Babylon, just so Augustus prided himself on receiving embassies from the 1 Dio Cassius, 56, 36, 2 ff. 2 Perhaps Vergil himself prepared the way for this exaggeration by his words in Georg. 3, 26-27: In foribus pugnam ex auro solidoque elephanto Gangaridum faciam victorisque arma Quirini. 3 Suetonius, Aug. 18. 4 Pliny, N.H. 35, 92-94, see note I, p. 53. 5 Suetonius, Aug. 50; Pliny, N.H. 37, io.</page><page sequence="50">56 Andrew Runni Anderson peoples of the East.' By a curious coincidence we are informed by Strabo that the name of one of these kings was Porus.2 Kampers 3 says that the first who consciously utilized the tradition of Alexander to political ends, was, as far as we know, Vergil. From the picture of the great Macedonian he borrowed the coloring for his description of the messianic empire of Augustus. He goes on to say that the report of a messianic return of Alexander would not be hushed, and that Vergil therefore sought to remove the foundation for it by transferring it to Augustus whose glories he sang. A pertinent passage is Aen. 8, 678 ff., dealing with the battle of Actium and its significance: Hinc Augustus agens Italos in proelia Caesar cum patribus populoque, penatibus et magnis dis, stans celsa in puppi; geminas cui tempora flammas laeta vomunt, patriumque aperitur vertice sidus. The scene is one of striking solemnity and significance. Speaking ex eventu, Vergil could take victory as assured and recognize that civil wars and waste were over and that Greco-Roman civilization was now safe. "Patriumque aperitur vertice sidus" marks him as the heir and successor of Julius, a sign which I have 4 given reason to believe really goes back to Alexander himself and was adopted from him by the Ptolemies. What about geminas cui tempora flammas laeta vomunt? Servius explained them as referring to the brightness of Augustus's eyes. Modern commentators, as for example Heyne, see here a remi- 1 Res Gestae, 31; cf. Arrian, Anab. 7, 19; Diod. 17, 113. 2 Strabo, 15, I, 4 (text doubtful); 15, I, 73. 3 Kampers, op. cit., p. 41; cf. H. Christensen, in the introduction to his article, Alexander der grosse bei den rdmischen Dichtern, in Neue Jahrbiicher f.d. klassische Altertum, XXIII (1909), pp. 107 ff.: "Die Feststellung seiner Monarchie und die Form, in die er seine Herrscherstel- lung gekleidet hatte, war es, die den r6mischen Kaisern seit Casar und Augustus das Vorbild lieferte und sie veranlasste, sich mit ihm in Vergleich zu stellen und seine Gotthihnlichkeit ihm nachzumachen. Ja schliesslich verkirperte sich in ihm in Verbindung mit den r6mischen Reichsgedanken die Hoffnung auf einen Messias, der die Welt von allen Leiden und N6ten wieder erl6sen sollte." 4 See above pp. 26-28.</page><page sequence="51">Heracles and his Successors 57 niscence of passages in the Iliad in which a hero I had the favor of Athena who made their helmets shine with the brightness of the metal. Henry, however, has shown that in all probability Augustus was bare- headed, and therefore without a metal helm to shine. Deonna 2 explains the phenomenon by identifying Augustus with Apollo-Helius, whose sign was a corona radiata - a sign which also characterized the Seleucids. This seems to be correct, as far as it goes, but does not explain geminas. May not the situation show that just as Augustus inherited the Caesaris astrum, so Vergil meant that he should inherit also the horns of Alexander made luminous? 3 In the course of time there grew up around Augustus's name stories that seem to align him with Alexander. Most of these are told by Sue- tonius, and his legend has been studied in detail by Deonna.4 The most striking element of similarity is that of his conception: to his mother as she was undergoing incubation in the temple of Apollo, the god appeared in the form of a serpent,5 as the marks on her body seemed 1 Diomede, 5, 4 ff.; Achilles, 18, 206-14, 225-227; 22, 26-29, 134-35. 2 Le Tresor des Fins d'Annecy. in Rev. Arch. XI (1920), p. 186. 3 The case of Moses descending from Mt. Sinai (Exodus, XXIV, 29, 30, 35) is interesting, by way of comparison. The Hebrew word which describes the face of Moses is susceptible of two meanings, radiant and horned. The Septuagint gives 6EA6O'aGcat, which translates the former; Jerome in the Vulgate gives cornutam, which translates the latter. Jerome hardly intended that his rendering should be taken literally, and did not specify the number of horns, but left it easily to be inferred that there were two. Such was the interpretation given the passage by Michelangelo in his Statue of Moses in San Pietro in Vincoli. The horns in being translated into marble lost their luminosity. If my interpretation of the Vergilian passage be correct, Vergil reversed the process by making luminous the two horns of Alexander. * Suet., Augustus, 94. Deonna, La Legende d'Octave-Auguste, in Rev. de l'histoire des religions, LXXXIII and LXXXIV (1921). 6 Cf. Dio Cassius, 45, I, 2, which is undoubtedly based on the passage in Sue- tonius. Apollinaris Sidonius actually brings Alexander and Augustus together in the manner of their conception, 2, 121 ff.: Magnus Alexander nec non Augustus habentur Concepti serpente deo, Phoebumque Iovemque Divisere sibi; namque horum quaesiit unus Cinyfia sub Syrte patrem, maculis genetricis Alter Phoebigenum sese gaudebat haberi, Paeonii iactans Epidauria signa dracontis.</page><page sequence="52">58 Andrew Runni Anderson to indicate. Octavius was leading an army through Thrace, and in the grove of Liber he inquired about the destiny of his son. In the sacrifice a pillar of fire sprang forth from the wine and mounted even to the sky, a phenomenon that had occurred to no one else, so the priests said, since Alexander himself made sacrifices at the same altar. Augustus was also credited with imitating Alexander in the knitting of his brow, and in the inclination of his head toward the left shoulder, this in imitation of the Diadochi. The eagle that perched on the first letter of his name was interpreted as giving notice that Jupiter would claim him back.</page></plain_text>
