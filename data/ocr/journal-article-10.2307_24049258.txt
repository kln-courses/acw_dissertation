On the other hand, cups nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9, with shapes varying from the hemispherical to the conical and their annular, curved foot, decidedly belong to the twelfth century;10 their green or pale blue glaze on slip is characteristic of the pre-Mongol period.11 The enamelled ware forms a special group, the production of which was elaborated in Samarkand during the twelfth-thirteenth centu ries.12 These are covered with a pale blue, trans parent glaze.13 This group includes a small jug (no. 11) and also a lamp (no. 7) which is typical of the Samarkand production in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.14 The pottery collected in layers IV-III is on the whole of a domestic character,- in all prob ability it comes from refuse brought from neighbouring dwellings,15 as well as from the Friday mosque; the latter source is clear for fragments of architectural decoration (nos. 18, 19), similar to those which adorned the mihrab wall of the mosque in the second half of the twelfth century.16 layer ii: this layer, containing many baked bricks (some almost complete), was formed as a result of the destruction of neighbouring build ings after the siege of 1220, or perhaps a little earlier, during the last large-scale reconstruc tion of the mosque.17 Apart from bricks, this layer, obviously of heterogeneous formation, contained ceramics from both the tenth and the thirteenth centuries and a few sherds from a Chinese bowl (fig. 5-b), whose fragments were mainly recovered from layers III—IV. layer i: this layer consists of spoils from pre vious excavations. In conclusion, all of the available data indi cates that layers IV-III, where fragments of Chinese ceramic ware first appear, belong to a specific period during the time in which the basin was filled with deposits of refuse, most probably the second half of the twelfth century.

Houses of a modest standing have been identified in 1990 to the south, opposite a moat.

This ware was famous in the Islamic 95</page><page sequence="10">soKOLovsKAiA and rougeulle: Chinese Porcelains from Samarkand world in the ninth-tenth centuries and has been brought to light on sixteen coastal and in land sites. Generally speaking, Chinese ceram ics from this period, if not abundant, were widespread and reached the Maghreb to the west and Nishapur to the east.19 It is therefore possible that the piece from Samarkand trav elled by sea to one of the Persian Gulf harbours, particularly Basra or Siraf; and then by track via Baghdad, Rayy, and Nishapur, through the Khorassan road; or via Shiraz, Istakhr, and Nishapur, through the desert road. That ware was also produced in northern China, however, and could equally well have reached Samar kand overland by way of the Silk Road. Chinese ceramics from the twelfth century onwards that are known at Afrasiab consist of two ding bowls, two qingbai bowls, and a dozen Longquan sherds. It is very interesting to note that, if qingbai and Longquan imported wares are well represented in Islam, ding porcelain, on the contrary, is very rare,- only two other bowls with moulded designs were found in the Middle East, at Fostat and Qalcat al-Bahrain.20 It is thus very probable that this typical north ern ware was imported to Samarkand through the Silk Road, and this is the earliest trace yet attested of such a trade. The qingbai and Longquan pieces, produced in southern kilns, could have travelled through the maritime net work, but no contemporary examples of these wares have been found east of Gorgan, in east ern Iran. Altogether, less than twenty pieces of Chi nese ceramics from the eighth-fourteenth cen turies are known from Central Asia, and, except for Samarkand, it appears that none of the great trade cities on the Silk Road have yielded such material. It is only logical that this heavy, yet fragile, merchandise essentially was exported through the maritime network of the Indian Ocean during this period.21 The recent discov eries from the basin nevertheless indicate that some samples of ding ware, at least, were im ported to Samarkand by land via the Silk Road as early as the twelfth century. This network was to be used on a much larger scale from the end of the fourteenth century on, as shown by the presence of late Longquan and blue and white porcelain pieces at several sites in Cen tral Asia,21 including the new Samarkand re founded by Tamerlane to the south of Afrasiab. Notes **CNRS, Paris. 1. See, for example, a bowl from the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, Stockholm, with phoenixes among cloud-like scrolls quite similar to the design of the Samarkand piece, Gray 1984, pi. 54. 2. Floral scrolls seem quite unusual but can be seen on a bowl from the British Museum, Medley 1976, fig. 77. 3. This type of design is often associated, in qingbai ware, with the motif of playing boys,- see Wirgin 1979, pl. 20-b: a bowl dated from the twelfth century. 4. See, for example, a bowl from the Seattle Art Museum, Gray 1984, pi. 124. 5. Details about the body, glaze, and dimensions of this piece are not specified. 6. Identical pieces, with the same decoration and rim, have been found on the floors and in the fill of the surface level at Harba, Iraq, a city abandoned in the thirteenth-fourteenth centuries (personal docu mentation) and also at Julfar, United Arab Emirates, a site dating back to the fourteenth century (Hans man 1985, fig. 7-a). Very few of the 3,404 pieces of Longquan celadon found in the Sinan shipwreck (ca. 1320) have foliated rims (Mc Elney 1979), and some scholars think that such rims were not in extensive use before 1330 (Medley 1975). 7. Same remarks as in n. 5, above. 8. A Longquan piece decorated with this motif has been found at the bottom of the ditch associated with the fortress of Qalcat al-Bahrain, a building abandoned at the end of the thirteenth century (per sonal documentation). Other pieces with similar decoration were found at some Islamic coastal sites from the fourteenth century, in the Gulf area and in Eastern Africa, and also in the Sinan shipwreck (Valenstein 1979, figs. 10-11; Anonymous 1977). 9. [Although the Afrasiab plateau was in the main left uninhabited after the siege of 1220 because of the destruction of its artificial water system, it was still frequented by people in search for building material, and, in addition, it has remained the stage of open-air festivals up to this century. Such circum stances explain why post-thirteenth century sherds are picked up here and there on the surface, but they would hardly account for the presence of costly Chi nese vases. One is led, therefore, to question whether a date prior to 1220 should be ruled out completely for these two Longquan pieces (F. Grenet).] 10. See Sokolovskaia, n. 15, above. 11. Rougeulle 1991a. 12.

In the ninth-eleventh centuries, Chinese imports represent 0.9% of the ceramics excavated in the residential area and bazaar of Siraf, the most important harbour and entrepôt for the maritime trade of the Islamic world at that period (Tampoe 1989; Rougeulle 1991b). Later on, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, this material represents about 0.6% of the ceramics excavated at Qalcat al-Bahrain (personal documentation) and Fos tat (Scanlon 1971). 14.

At Fostat, only 7 sherds over a total of more than 4,000 Chinese sherds stud ied by B. Gyllensvärd are described by the author as ding pieces (Gyllensvärd 1973, p. 117). 21. Reduced as it is, the corpus of Chinese ceram ics from Samarkand is also interesting for the com plete lack of stoneware jars. These pieces were exported to the Middle East as containers for perish able stuff and have been found in quantity on most of the Islamic coastal sites: they represent 60% of the Chinese ceramics excavated in the residential area and bazaar of Siraf (Tampoe 1989). Except for a few isolated sherds found on some inland sites, on the main tracks from the coast and the large cities of Iraq and Iran, these large jars do not seem to have been used for land transportation in Islam. Perish able merchandise imported from China in these jars was certainly transferred into local containers, probably smaller, for their redistribution from the main harbours to the inland market (Rougeulle 1991a, p. 531). The absence of the jars in Central Asia could indicate that they were not used for transportation on the Silk Road either. 22. On that question, see Vakturskaya 1957 and Rogers 1970.
