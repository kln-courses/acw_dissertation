<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMFORT COMES FROM THE EAST P.K. Joy's new anthology Forced Smiles (Indian Writers Press, India, 1988) is a collection of biting poems meant to induce "forced smiles on melancholic faces,55 because a hearty laugh is a luxury that the pariahs and all those in distress, in other words the majority of humankind, cannot afford. The poet is called to undertake the classic promethean task of transforming our tragic reality through an imaginative use of language. He at the same time takes on the role of social critic. But this very enterprise of poetic creation and social reform itself is derided. Hence another reason for the strained smile when we witness the strange fate of the poet, tragi-comic figure enmeshed in the follies of mortals. 84 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. VI NO. 3 JULY-SEPT 1989</page><page sequence="2">MISCELLANY The poet casts a critical eye in the manner of Balzac on the "comedie humaine55 and mocks with undisguised zest a broad spectrum of the social order, from nagging women and unscrupulous businessmen to ambitious politicians and spiritual charlatans. P.K. Joy is not overdy autobiographical although he claims to speak from personal experience. By making of the poet a central character in the imaginary world he evokes, he leads us to ask the question: who is the "I55 of Forced Smiles) The poet-character that speaks to us is and is not always P.K. Joy. There is thus a kind of "dedoublement,55 the detachment that allows for both identification with and detachment from the voice addressing us. The poet can thus be both judge and victim. He can portray the paradox surrounding our identity by simultaneously adopting and debunking the position of a victim, but not so innocent victim, of the carriage of justice. You have chopped off my hand with your reaping hook Exactly a decade back with the same hand I had gagged your father and raped your mother. (When I Became a Poet) Occasionally, he roams the back alleys of society as an outcast, "a small time55 poet on whom the politician "spat as a wreath,55 shunned as a "grief-monger55 by college girls. He stumbles upon the humdrum and the coarse mundane business of human life. He discovers, for example, in the guise of T.S. Eliot, the sordid reality of money transactions with a mercenary publisher that denies the poet the dignity accorded to a creator of beauty. (PoetJs Plight). With righteous indignation in the face of social injustice, the poet rails against the abuses of the high and mighty: ...with your money and your muscle power you were playing with my parents5 self-respect, my brothers dignity and my sisters5 chastity, disregarding their implorations. Stop criminals, your atrocities against the weak! (Flee from This Holy Land!) INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. VI NO. 3 JULY-SEPT 1989 85</page><page sequence="3">MISCELLANY The poet exposes the abuses of religion, the exploitation of human credulity, the credulity of a humanity groaning in travail, seeking relief from its soul-destroying maladies ("all conceivable human problems like barren ness, diseases of incurable nature, match-making for ugly girls, evil spirits and idiocy55) through the purchase of "solutions...magical powers endued in talismans, powders and holy water.55 (A God Under Arrest). It is the fate of satirical poets, generally, to make enemies and draw, like lightning rods, the fire and the wrath of vengeful fools. So the poet sometimes gets killed but, as is the case in both ancient mythology and the traditional Indian worldview, the poet is immortal; "a poet does not die.55 (My Claim to Greatness) He joins the ranks of the privileged few on whom the supreme God "has bestowed (his) own creative ability.55 He is metamorphosed into a demigod, anointed and ordained from above with power to "make anything.55 The sociability of the poet with the gods is to be seen within the Greek anthropomorphic tradition as well as within the tradition of Indian familiarity with avatars, metempsychosis, and reincar nation. The law of Karma also is seen in operation in the world P.K. Joy creates, affirming an inexorable moral and retributive law governing the affairs of men. In all these instances the poetry of P.K. Joy thrives on the disruption that prevails in our world, whether it be vertically in our relationship with the gods and the spirit world or in our horizontal social relationships. One observes, like in Sartre, the portrayal of human relations in existentialist terms. My identity is determined by the "other55 who, however, through constant criticism and fault-finding, threatens the integrity of my personality, if not my very existence. After repeatedly failing to demonstrate "proper55 behavior to the other, the poet asks, in desperation almost, I beg you to tell me what should be my nature to be a normal man in your eyes. (To Be a Normal Man) This breakdown in human relations, due mostly to the absence of charity, leads to double standards, inauthentic living, false dedication in order to impress the masses, to prejudices that lock persecutor and persecuted in a deadly embrace. (Cf. Leave Me Alone) A decadent society of violence, 86 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. VI NO. 3 JULY-SEPT 1989</page><page sequence="4">MISCELLANY indulges in "the beating in the night when neighbors are asleep.55 Such a state of affairs drives despondent individuals to the edge of despair: I had planned and still keep planning to end my life by suicide. (Forced Smiles) This is indeed a very dark picture of a very bleak world. The gloom is tempered, however, by the moral righteousness, the sense of mission of the ever returning poet who often speaks from the other side of life, from the world of the departed, backed in his world-transforming mandate by the formidable support of a host of similarly injured spirits. {New War) The strict demarcation between the supernatural world and the natural world is erased. The loss of the physical body, often through painful death, is transformed into a sacrificial offering, a kind of redemptive act (in imitation of Christ?). The voice that rises from the grave, though different in thrust and tone from that of the Chateaubriand of "Memoires d5 Outretombe,55 speaks of another life, where poetry is a spiritual exercise for both catharsis and elevation. This voice proclaims a new order where services rendered are repaid not just in cash but in love. Work is drudgery no more; it too is transformed to become meaningful service. (Remunera tion) Virtue becomes its own reward, the principle of love is universalized, the restored practice of charity consolidates the moral covenant among men while giving pride of place to Transcendence. (Cf. Ultimate Reward and Forgive Them) The pessimism that would otherwise dominate the tragic of the human condition is thus subdy diluted through the detachment irony allows. The sarcasm of P.K. Joy^ social criticism, blatant as in this account of the poet's burial: ...a coffin bought after a bargain, some flower petals a quickly read-out prayer, minimum wage to the grave-diggers, and lasdy a hidden sigh of relief while leaving the grave-yard. (The Ultimate Reward) INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. VI NO. 3 JULY-SEPT 1989 87</page><page sequence="5">MISCELLANY is toned down by a touch of the ludicrous and the burlesque as when the dead poet is made to carry his dead body while reciting his own elegy: People in general had no time to hear me, some fled at my sight, crying "ghost, ghost, in the bright day light,55 some slammed their front doors; some others ignored me saying: "another case of schizophrenia55 one or two even let loose their dogs and Fd to run with the load on my shoulder. (My claim to greatness) P.K. Joy wins the reader5s sympathy for his hapless poet by the con geniality of his conversational style, by drawing us into a kind of private dialogue which accords a privileged vantage point from which to look at life. His intellectual posture is reminiscent of the wit and the satirical vein of Pope. His tantric allusions when I was Narayana you called me a 'pervert5 for my lady always straddling on my navel bring to mind the directness and lewdness of some medieval morality plays. Or is it rather the Chaucer of the Canterbury Tales, plus the conceit of the English metaphysical poets? Do we have echoes of the John Donne of The Sun Rising ("Busy old fool...55) or the deceptive simplicity of style and the verve of Wordsworth in, say, Expostulation and Reply} (Let us recall, for example, Wordsworth5s "Up! up! and drink the spirit breathed/From dead men to their kind55). Perhaps these are mighty names of the Pantheon to invoke, whose works possess refined elegance, hallowed dignity and the consecration added by the passage of time. P.K. Joy certainly aspires to join the ranks of these departed gods. He should in due course gain the mature confidence that qualifies him for such good company. His poetry 88 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. VI NO. 3 JULY-SEPT 1989</page><page sequence="6">MISCELLANY will speak for itself, stand on its own merit. Growing naturally in stature, the author will not have to try to impress and predispose the reader to the greatness of his work by quoting in frontispiece "Excerpts From Eminent Scholars5 Opinions of P.K. Joy^ Poetry.55 Meanwhile, as we proceed through the slim volume of blank verse that P.K. Joy coyly slips into our hands, the disturbing realism of the human condition, so graphically rendered in disarming cadence and engaging rhythm, certainly tantalizes us to "Forced Smiles.55 Lewis CA.
