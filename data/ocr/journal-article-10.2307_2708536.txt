<plain_text><page sequence="1">TUZET: COSMOS AND IMAGINATION BY GEORGE BOAS The title of this book accurately indicates its contents. Mile Tuzet is not interested merely in scientific theories about cosmology, but also in their interrelations with the poetic imagination, religious doctrines, and mythology. Above all she recognizes her debt to Lovejoy's comments on "metaphysical pathos," and indeed is one of the few French historians of ideas who have read the works of their American colleagues. But she is also widely read in English poetry as well as French and Italian, the first in all probability through Miss Nicolson's studies to which she pays tribute. She has also profited from the works of Gaston Bachelard, too little known in the United States, from Koestler and from Koyr6. There seems to be little in the field of either scientific or philosophic cosmology that she has not read and analyzed. And since her reading is supplemented by a knowl- edge of what I can only call metaphysical fiction, the whole subject is pretty thoroughly explored. In fact, her book has proved a delight to at least one reader. Mlle Tuzet recognizes that the great cosmological speculations are not simply descriptions of stars and milky ways, but are also expressions of pleasure and pain. In her opening chapter she divides the men whom she is to study into Heracliteans and Parmenideans, a division which she ad- mits is only a first approximation. There are then those who see the cosmos as a great stable whole, bound together by some type of law, highly unified in some sense of that word, and who are also either content with such security or depressed by the thought of it. The Heracliteans, on the other hand, are obviously those who express themselves in terms of change, the dynamic, the ever-growing, and again are either depressed by the lack of stability and unity or delighted at vitality, creativity, and dynamism. So much could be figured out by any freshman in an introductory course in "The Problems of Philosophy." But this is the first step and only the first step. For the unity of the world may be material, a unity of stuff or substance, or it may be a unity of structure. And in both cases there are discernible differences between the kind of unity, for instance, which is expressed in Newton's Principia with a cosmic Lawgiver keeping every- thing in line and that of Descartes' vortices in which the matter itself, once it has been given its initial push, continues forever. Oddly enough, as Pascal saw, Descartes, the pupil of the Jesuits, had no place for God after the first moment of Creation, whereas Newton needed God at every moment. There are also important differences in the kinds of structure attributed to the cosmos as a whole. There are structures which relate an infinity of lesser universes and those which are simply a wild lyric out- burst of energy without purpose or termination. And for each of these there corresponds a hopeful or despairing attitude on the part of their discoverers, poets, and dreamers. There are pictures of the world as en- closed within a shell and of a world without spatial limits, worlds which *Helene Tuzet. Le Cosmos et 'Imagination.

The possibility of chance as a cosmic factor is played against a rigid determinism with the accompanying emotional obbligato. But to list all the possibilities described and analyzed by Mlle Tuzet would be to reproduce her book and my purpose is only to induce other historians to read it, not to make a digest of it. How conscious one is of the influence of metaphysical pathos upon one's thinking is not discussed. It will be recalled that Bacon was aware of how people differed in their interest in particularity and universality and James for one admitted his dislike of the unified and big. Lovejoy in his beautiful tribute to James, "William James as Philosopher," 1 went so far as to say that "all philosophies ... are the result of a temperament (itself partly moulded by a historical situation) with impersonal logical con- siderations arising out of the nature of the problems with which man's reason is confronted. Even the most rigorous reasoner must needs have premises; and not even the most conscientious reasoner is likely to see all the premises that there are which are pertinent to so large an argument as that concerning the general nature of things. What each sees will depend upon his personal vision." It might be thought that one of the most im- portant tasks of a philosopher was to unearth such hidden premises. But there is a question whether such a task can be carried out. For the very method of finding them involves at least methodological rules if not de- scriptive premises and they too may be colored by strong temperamental inclinations. It would be hard to think of Schelling writing Hume's Treatise or even, if he accepted its conclusions, Bergson writing Identite et Realite. Mile Tuzet does not go into this question. She takes metaphysical pathos as one of her data, accepts its existence, and proceeds from there. There is another question that Mlle Tuzet does not explore. I am not finding fault with her for this, for she is well aware, as she points out in her conclusion, that much remains to be done. The question to which I refer is the very existence of such a thing as a universe, a thing which may have a beginning in time as well as an end, a structure, a substance of some single kind or of multiple kinds. Just what are we talking about when we speak of "the cosmos"? In my own opinion we are talking in mythical language of something whose existence is very dubious. The Greek and Roman philosophers had a world which was the shores of the Mediterranean and what land lay beyond those shores was very vague but definitely limited in extent. It was a small domed area with an inland sea and at most an encircling ocean. Have we in our turn not simply in- flated that image in our talk of a stellar universe to the point where we wonder how it came into existence and how it will pass away, with our theories of the Big Bang or the creation of hydrogen ions out of nothing, our nebular hypotheses, our condensations of mysteriously generated gases? Aristotle had no difficulty in believing that the cosmos was eternal and in Timaeus all that has a beginning in time was the fashioning of pre-existing matter. But once we begin to talk about the universe-as-a-whole we find it 1 Reprinted in The Thirteen Pragmatisms and other Essays (Baltimore, 1963), 79ff. My quotation is from p. 88.</page><page sequence="3">608 GEORGE BOAS irresistible to argue about how the whole came to be and what will happen to it, as if it were something made or generated by a superhuman Demiurge. Few if any philosophers have ever put the question to themselves, though I gather that at least one physicist, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer in his William James Lectures, did so. His remarks unfortunately have not been published. Another strange aspect of the ideas discussed in this book is the despair or joy, as the case may be, which invades a man who reaches some con- clusion about the Cosmos. One might imagine that the significance of a human life was strictly bounded by its social environment or at most by the planet Earth. Few of us get depressed even at the news that there is famine in India and those who do see no reason to think that this makes their own lives less worth living. They seldom say, "What use is there in my feeding my children if Indian children are starving?" "Why should I wear warm clothes when they cost the life of a sheep?" "Why marry since on Sirius my marriage would be of no importance?" What I am trying to suggest is that our ethical problems arise here in a limited situation in the presence of and perhaps because of other human beings. These prob- lems are in no way solved by situations elsewhere in the solar system, not to speak of regions beyond it. In short the notion of the problematic context is one that has seldom been entertained by cosmological thinkers. They apparently feel themselves to be cosmopolites in the literal sense of that term and if their existence makes no difference beyond our galaxy, they feel frustrated-or, if they happen to be of the antithetical temperament, elated. They are then elated at the thought that they are snuggled in the bosom of Mother Earth. If one is writing a book for the possible amuse- ment or edification of hypothetical creatures beyond the Milky Way, millions of light years distant from us, then one is doomed to be disap- pointed. For that matter most of us are read by a small percentage of our colleagues. Why envision the world as partial to the human race? And why, when we discover that it is not partial to us, weep and wail about it? One of the great merits of Mile Tuzet's book is its inclusion of minor as well as major figures. She does not hesitate to include Flammarion and Velikowsky among her cosmologists nor Jules Verne and H. G. Wells among her litterateurs. With her there is no distinction between Trojan and Tyrian; both will be treated fairly. Consequently the panorama that she gives us is well nigh complete in detail and one can almost say that it is a picture of the human imagination as a whole. This is very important in view of the anticipation by poets of ideas later developed by scientists and which is certainly part of the history of ideas. For it also helps ex- plain how ideas get spread around and become public property. It more- over has the advantage of showing how basic metaphors are moved from field to field. To take but one example, Fourier and Edgar Allan Poe both wrote books of a cosmological interest, but neither has been taken seriously by the general run of scholars. Fourier's figures of speech all seem to come from his social doctrines whereas Poe's arise from his erotic disappoint- ments, from his yearning for a place in a coherent family, from a longing to be effective. I have never attempted to read Fourier's Theorie des Quatre Mouvements but I have read Eureka. If it is read as a scientific or</page><page sequence="4">TUZET: COSMOS AND IMAGINATION 609 metaphysical treatise, it comes close to nonsense. But it does not contain a line which is not alive with the kind of passion that Poe expressed in his verses. It is a work which begins to make sense the moment one sees in it a self-portrait in cosmological language. That such apparently scientific ideas have this passionate component is worth emphasizing. Poe's insistence on the interconnectedness of things gives the forlorn and rejected individual a sense of power whose effects will reach to the farthest limits of the universe. It is the flower in the crannied well translated into terms of energy. It is questionable whether anyone any longer holds to the absolute ob- jectivity of scientific ideas. Their truths are admittedly interpersonal and that is about as close to objectivity as one can come. But the notion that a scientist could abdicate as a human being and become a recording device, a collector of facts uncolored by human observation, a computer, seems to have lost favor even among the scientists themselves. The problem re- duces to the extent to which an observer is freed of the Four Idols. If a group of observers all accept the same figures of speech, the same methods of observation, the same premises, to say nothing of the same questions, they will probably all come out with the same answers. But the uniformity of method is never entire. Otherwise there would be no disagreement in science. The historian of ideas, when he has done his work as thoroughly as Mlle Tuzet, will give his readers some inkling of where the sources of disagreement lie. He will indicate how certain ideas just seem inherently more plausible to some minds than others do, though the minds in question will never have carried on a scientific investigation. He will also indicate how certain scientific conclusions seem horrid or charming to some minds and thus influence their philosophies of life, if nothing more. Thus the death of the solar system through the ultimate maximum of entropy used to be the subject of novels, short stories, and lyrics, and usually, it would appear, only a few men welcomed the prospect. But those whom Mme Tuzet calls les Fils de la Nuit seemed ready to embrace the idea not with resignation but with pleasure: "Les ames assoiffees de Neant, envoutees par l'Inde et Schopenhauer, aspirent a cette immobilite sans renaissance, en viennent a rever d'un univers entier enseveli dans les tenebres" (p. 440). It has not escaped anyone's notice that all such ideas are incapable of demonstration. No one to speak of has raised the question of how one could know whether it was better for human life to be extinguished or be perpetuated. How would one know whether it was better for the universe to be indefinitely extended in space or bounded by a crystalline sphere? The logical empiricist would probably say that the questions have no meaning, but even one who does not adhere to that dogma might suggest that "better" is a comparative which probably applies to human choices. The suggestion, however, would be indignantly rejected by the majority of philosophers who seem to think that human problems must have cosmic relevance, that, for instance, a life on this earth which does not cause at least a slight tremor on Neptune or beyond is hardly worth while. We have all grown up under the influence of anthropomorphic theology and anthro- pocentric cosmology, and sceptical comments, like the famous one of Xenophanes, glide over us with only a momentary quiver. The attempts</page><page sequence="5">610 GEORGE BOAS to escape from anthropomorphism are like the attempts to escape from the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics: the will to believe takes over. But sometimes there seems to be a possibility that the will to believe operates below the level of awareness, especially where certain statements are said to be self-evident-"Anything else would be incon- ceivablel" Are these repulsions or acceptances attributable to the uncon- scious presence of Jungian archetypes? Mile Tuzet at times seems to think they are. This, I should judge, is the weakest part of her demonstration. Unfortunately it is unnecessary, for an historian can hardly be expected to ask the psychological question of why, for instance, Bastian wanted to prove the spontaneous generation of life and why Pasteur was determined to prove biogenesis. It is enough to point out the reasons which each man gives in support or denial of an idea without trying to psychoanalyze him. But there is also a problem involved in the resort to archetypes: if some men are guided by one archetypal image and others by another, you come out with a petitio principii when you explain their conclusions by the influences of their peculiar susceptibilities. The Four Elements are as archetypal as you please, but unless all thinking beings use them all in the same way and under the same circumstances, to say that a man talks in terms of earth because he is earthly tells one nothing. If it is true that some men confine their interests to a select group of archetypes, that is a fact of course of the greatest interest. But one still has to avoid falling into the trap of Moliere's vis dormitiva. The Johns Hopkins University.</page></plain_text>
