Furthermore, like other inhabitants of the city, that is, Istanbullus, his life is imbued with this inescapable melancholy. Taking issue with the apparent anachronism of Pamuk' s historical argument, I show how he constructs and naturalizes this association between Istanbul, melancholy, and loss of empire by creating a literary genealogy for his claim. Using the Bakhtinian concept of chronotope (a schema that recognizes and explains the patterns of fusion of time, space, and emotion as thematic constellation or narrative pattern), I argue that what Pamuk identifies in and derives from the writings of his predecessors is the chronotope of Istanbul. I show how Pamuk constructs the hybrid literary canon and tradition (that references Balzac and Joyce as much as it does Beyatli and Tanpinar) in which he locates himself in the process of deriving this chronotope. Orhan Pamuk has so eloquently connected the concept of hiiziin (melancholy) with his life in Istanbul that his memoir Istanbul , where he establishes this link, is now being used as a reference text in discussing both melancholy in general and Turkish hiiziin in particular. His attribution of the prevalence of hiiziin in Istanbul to a collective sense of loss experienced by the city over the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seems only to reinforce the connection between Istanbul, sadness, and Pamuk by offering a historical explanation. The first problem this essay puzzles over is the unquestioning and even eager acceptance of these sweeping connections by all kinds of readers, as the following examples demonstrate. In one of the early reviews of the book in The Guardian , Jan Morris not only takes this Turkish hiiziin as an uncontestable and self- evident fact but also uses it as a springboard to talk about her own double Welsh/British melancholy, observing that Pamuk "lives, breathes and honours hiiziin , a congenital Turkish melancholy apparently akin to Welsh hiraeth."1 She claims that she is qualified to review this book because she has also "experienced - with mingled pride, shame and regret - the extinction of an imperial order."2 Peter Levine, a blogger who visited Istanbul after reading Pamuk's book, boasts of duplicating Pamuk's experience: "I have wandered with a scholarly European guidebook through the poor western quarters of the Sibel Erol is a Clinical Professor in the Department of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies, New York University, New York; e-mail: sibel.erol@nyu.edu Â© Cambridge University Press 2011 0020-7438/1 1 $15.00</page><page sequence="2">656 Sibel Erol Old City, finding Byzantine ruins, old mosques, and leftover Ottoman wooden houses whose upper stories lean over the streets. I have relished the hilzun that Pamuk has lived with for half a century."3 Finally, Andreas Huyssen gives a literary critic's stamp of approval to this reading of inherent sadness in Istanbul - which he says was shaped by "Turkish history and the literary imagination of Western visitors" - when he describes the "Huzun" chapter from Istanbul , by stating, "In the urban scenes and tableaux Pamuk conjures, huziin becomes palpable almost as a material reality."4 Why do these readers accept Pamuk's claim that he and his fellow inhabitants of Istanbul, that is, Istanbullus, suffer from a shared and readily observable melancholy that is caused by historical events? Pamuk repeatedly warns his readers against believing him. He tells them that what he remembers is subjective and filled with errors caused by misunderstanding and chance associations. At the very beginning of the memoir, when trying to identify the reason for his belief that he had a twin who lived a happier life in another part of Istanbul, he concludes, "I can't remember where I got this idea or how it came to me. It must have emerged from a web of rumors, misunderstandings, illusions, and fear."5 When he realizes that his reminiscences don't match with what his mother and brother remember about their relationship, he adds, "So anyone reading these pages should bear in mind that I am prone to exaggeration" (p. 294). He admits that the childhood he talks of is reconstructed, as when he describes his writing process as something that occurred "[i]n later years, when I was reinventing the Istanbul of my childhood" (p. 108). At the outset, he offers advice about how he needs to be read carefully and asks for forgiveness in return for being forthright about his unreliability: "So pay close attention, dear reader. Let me be straight with you, and in return let me ask for your compassion" (p. 8). Yet, these reminders against, approaching Pamuk's account at face value are lost in the actual practice and momentum of reading the book, because it is presented as a memoir. We read memoirs differently from how we read fiction because we take the former to be true and factual. In this case, the history of a city is presented and, moreover, supported with the documentary evidence of photographs whose concrete "truth" overrides any general warning about unreliability. The personal nature of the memoir further disarms the reader's critical defenses both because it involves experiential claims of truth and because of the personable manner of its approach to its audience, which fosters an identification on the reader's part. Pamuk sharpens the appeal of the personal by using his autobiography as the medium of entry into the story of Istanbul. The argumentative evidence that might be treated skeptically in a discursive presentation is absorbed into the subjective logic of the autobiographical narrative, all the while according it factual support. This combination of the factual and the emotional proves to have an irresistible force; it is the main reason why his readers believe Pamuk's narrative and do not take his warnings seriously. Pamuk makes this emotional pull toward identification easier for them by explicitly concentrating on an emotion, hiizun, as the subject of his analysis. He creates a hybrid narrative of Istanbul and his life as intertwining stories of hilzun , which both explain and demonstrate this emotion while offering it as an identificatory hook for his readers. In order to create this hybrid story of his life and Istanbul, Pamuk transforms his personal experience of sadness into a collective and typical one by creating a prehistory for it in Istanbul through a chain of influences and developments that explain it and derive</page><page sequence="3">The Chronotope of Istanbul in Orhan Pamuk's Memoir Istanbul 657 it from that past. According to the progression Pamuk traces, he is first a character, a child, experiencing and being shaped by Istanbul's inescapable hiiziin (although he tries to resist it, he says); then he attempts to understand what causes and disseminates it, as demonstrated by his long lists of explanations; and finally he traces it to the "image" of the city created by 19th- and 20th-century French and Turkish authors such as Gerard de Nerval, Theophile Gautier, Yahya Kemal Beyatli, and Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar, who previously identified hiiziin in Istanbul and who put this idea in circulation for different audiences in different eras. The progression from experience to consciousness and control is one prized by Pamuk, as we see in his exploration, using Schiller's schema and vocabulary, of naive authors who just write unconsciously from the heart and sentimental authors who consciously shape and manipulate their materials.6 In Istanbul , Pamuk dramatizes his own progression from naive protagonist to perceptive literary critic, who identifies and names the genealogy of the link between Istanbul and hiiziin , to master artist, who consciously manipulates and depicts their connection. In explicitly tracing the association of hiiziin with Istanbul through a historical explanation and charting this connection through the authors he has chosen, in causal links that culminate in his own work, he emerges as the conscious formulator of this relationship, which I describe as the chronotope of Istanbul. As I will explain, chronotope is a literary and narratorial schema that describes the intersection of time, place, and the affective worldview they constitute as an indivisible unit of comprehension and representation. Pamuk does not use the term chronotope, but he might as well, since his focus is on a place and a historical time, which together generate the feeling of hiiziin and the accompanying worldview of resignation. Identifying this constellation as a chronotope, more particularly as the Istanbul chronotope, allows us to understand Pamuk's project of creating a genealogy and tradition in which to place himself as a writer of Istanbul. Attention to the ways he puts together the vectors of time, place, and emotion in the construction of this chronotope necessarily undermines the identificatory kind of reading I described previously and opens up a more critical reading that also heeds Pamuk's warnings. THE CHRONOTOPE I use the term chronotope in the Bakhtinian sense of time and place (chronos-topos/time- place) that are fused in such a way as to embody a specific worldview and its attendant values and "conception of man" that shape the narrative. Bakhtin writes, In the literary artistic chronotope , spatial and temporal indicators are fused into one carefully thought-out, concrete whole. Time, as it were, thickens, takes on flesh, becomes artistically visible; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time, plot and history. This intersection of axes and fusion of indicators characterizes the artistic chronotope. 1 Here, Bakhtin is highlighting the inevitable interpenetration of time and place in any literary portrayal. As he recognizes, any depiction of place embeds time, and vice versa, and through their convergence time and place encode a specific worldview. To give a brief example, if I mention Ellis Island at the turn of the 20th century, you will already guess that I will be talking about the American dream. Furthermore, the association of this time and place will conjure up for you the image of a hard-working immigrant who hoped for a better life. The symbolic value a particular time and place acquire through</page><page sequence="4">658 Sibel Erol their connection, and the worldview this imparts, are the preconditions of translating a lived experience to an artistic representation. Bakhtin explains: A literary work's artistic unity in relationship to an actual reality is defined by its chronotope. Therefore the chronotope in a work always contains within it an evaluating aspect that can be isolated from the whole artistic chronotope only in abstract analysis. In literature and art itself, temporal and spatial determinations are inseparable from one another, always colored by emotions and values.8 This essay examines how the chronotope of Istanbul is constituted to embody feelings of loss and pain as well as the active embrace of these as a life philosophy, that is, it examines how Pamuk is able to represent Istanbul as the unchanging locus of hiizun.9 Any narrative will code its use of time and place according to the worldview it is imparting. The variations will depend on genre. As Bakhtin observes, different genres have different formulas for representing time and place, and consequently have developed shortcuts for depicting plot and characters that fit these formulas. In his historically evolutionary analysis, Bakhtin argues that genres preceding the 19th-century realist novel deal with varying degrees of abstract time and space but progressively evolve during the 19th century toward the concrete specificity that he prizes. Pamuk has to improvise and borrow his narrative conventions when he develops the chronotope of Istanbul because his is a hybrid form. Istanbul is a memoir both of his own life and of his city. Furthermore, the protagonists of these parallel accounts are identical to each other. The statement Pamuk makes in binding his life to the meaning of Istanbul, in a twist on Flaubert, is, "Istanbul, C'est moi ."10 In depicting this identity and reversibility, the chronotope' s constitutive elements of place and emotion do not pose a problem because they appear to be the same in both stories; but the element of time does, because the timescales of Istanbul's story and Pamuk's life are vastly different, and the crises of each story take place on different dates. Pamuk's own life story unfolds from 1952 to 1974, with a turning point in 1972. He tells Istanbul's story by focusing on three separate periods: the period of the visits of the French authors Nerval, Gautier, and Flaubert to the city from the 1830s to the 1860s; the period from the 1930s to the 1950s that the Turkish authors Beyatli and Tanpinar write about; and the period of the black-and-white Turkish melodramas of hiizun from the 1950s to the late 1960s. The time of crisis for Istanbul is the turn of the 20th century, when the empire is lost. Pamuk solves this incongruence in time, in terms of both scale and historical speci- ficity, by creating a composite and abstract timeframe that includes but transcends all the different historical dates mentioned. In order to do this, he either omits or downplays actual dates from his own life. For example, we only get two key dates of his life: 7 June 1955, his birthday, and March 1972, his artistic awakening or the beginning of his "second life," that is, his conscious life (in terms of the definitions of "first life" vs. "second life" that I will later analyze), of which this book is a product and accounting. The historical story of Istanbul acquires a greater specificity and concreteness than the personal story because most of the overtly stated dates in the book are in the period from the 1830s to 1 860s and refer to the Istanbul visits of French authors like Nerval, Gautier, and Flaubert. A shift in time is conveyed as progression through the story's next move to discussing the Turkish authors Beyatli and Tanpinar and then the black-and-white movies; but, because the dates in these discussions are not given as overtly and with the same emphasis and</page><page sequence="5">The Chronotope of Istanbul in Orhan Pamuk's Memoir Istanbul 659 frequency as those of the 19th century, the main narrative takes place in an abstract sub- jective present that seems to deceptively point to and read as the 19th century. Through this sleight of hand, Pamuk takes his audience to the actual time of the dissolution of the empire, which plays such an originary importance in his account of hiiziin. This sense of nebulous and unchanging time, whose association with the 19th century also conveys a psychological dimension of timelessness, emerges as the time of hiiziin. In combining different and specific time periods of his youth and of various authors' experiences of Istanbul into an abstract unchanging present, Pamuk performs the opposite of what Bakhtin valorizes: from specific chronotopes that carry the mark of their own particular times, Pamuk constructs a larger generic and archetypal chronotope whose temporal content corresponds to a biographical outline operating in an indeterminate time weighted toward the 19th century. Bakhtin shows that instead of concrete dates, such ahistorical narratives proceed by relative designations of "before" and "after," "at just that moment," and "suddenly."11 Pamuk defines various happenings in such relative terms - "102 years before my birth" (p. 6), "fifty years later" (p. 72), "in October 1850, seven years after Nerval's visit's to Istanbul" (p. 286) - which undermine the importance not only of concrete dates but also of larger time periods. "Two years before this, in 1852 (nine years after Nerval's visit and exactly a hundred years before my birth)" (p. 224) is a hyper-example that incorporates several different ways of referencing. These kinds of references that unite two or more separate dates in terms of a personal connection (to himself or to somebody else) uproot them from the particular dates given, and turn them into a designation of shared internal time in which the people referenced coexist, because the importance of their connection supersedes the designation of separate dates that belong to separate epochs and separate narratives. Time is relativized and turned into a subjective measurement. Pamuk returns the reader to the immediacy of the present with a Turkish form analogous to Bakhtin's "suddenly" - the - iver verb suffix, which shows the unexpectedness and quickness of the event happening at hand. With frequent use of this suffix,12 Pamuk brings the reader to the immediate present of the foreground, therefore distinguishing between an indeterminate past that blends into the present in the background and a more immediate one of present action in the moment, in between which the story fluctuates. The abstractness of this time helps hiiziin transcend its historically specific origin and become an inward, psychological state that defines Pamuk's life and that the readers of the memoir can identify with. Further, it is because time is defined as a subjective, abstract state instead of a historical duree that it can remain constant and can preserve the stability of the chronotope, as a result of which Istanbul can be seen as an unchanging and perpetual locus of melancholy and decline. I will now examine more closely the two strands of the narrative of self and Istanbul, whose intertwining shapes the story of hiiziin and whose exchange of roles constitutes the main action of the book. THE TWIN NARRATIVES: THEIR CHANGING WEIGHT AND INTERSECTION In writing a book with double protagonists, Pamuk accomplishes the difficult feat of balancing and melding the expectations of two genres: the autobiography and the</page><page sequence="6">660 Sibel Erol analytical essay. In the latter he examines black-and-white movies, novels, paintings, and prose writings of various kinds - such as newspaper articles, encyclopedia entries, and travel memoirs about Istanbul - as narratives of hiiziin. He concurrently clarifies and fixes the chronotope of Istanbul as hiiziin , offering his book as sort of an artistic achievement that parallels, for example, the production of the tarantella at the end of Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , by serving as a mark of his literary coming of age and as a sample of his literary talent. He links the two narratives of the autobiography and the essay through two move- ments of change, one of which is expressed in time and the other in space, each causing a different reversal in the direction of cause and effect and each appropriate for the genre it operates in. The biographical development reaches a moment of epiphany in which the young artist, in an episode reminiscent of Joyce's character Stephen Dedalus, discovers his artistic subject matter and vision, of which the book we are reading is a product. This autobiographical moment unfolding in the linear trajectory of the life story engenders and intersects with a reversal of logic in the essay, which changes the direction of the flow of power and causation in Pamuk's relationship with Istanbul. Originally, Pamuk's story is Istanbul's because he is a product of Istanbul, and therefore, he claims, Istanbul's story explains and clarifies his.13 This logic of cause and effect is reversed between Pamuk and Istanbul when he realizes that Istanbul's story is his because he is producing this story, with the explicit admission that if Istanbul represents hiiziin , it is only because he says so. This change in the direction of causation is a spatial shift between what constitutes the background and foreground narratives. Or it can be conceived as the turning around of the mobius strip of their relationship, which Pamuk sums up as, "I have described Istanbul when describing myself, and described myself when describing Istanbul" (p. 295). As this sequencing also implies, at first, the essay and its exploration of hiiziin in Istanbul explain Pamuk's life, but after the moment of epiphany, which is the "the center" of discovery and reversal, Pamuk's life gains explanatory force for the hiiziin located in Istanbul. ISTANBUL AS THE LOCUS AND CAUSE OF HUZON This identification of Istanbul as the cause of the hiiziin of its inhabitants constitutes the general content of the chronotope of Istanbul. This is the connection that the readers remember from the book. According to Pamuk's reasoning, Istanbul is an embodiment of hiiziin , a kind of predetermined sadness, which he carefully distinguishes from the melancholy defined by Burton and the tristesse identified by Levi-Strauss. Based on his reading of Richard Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy , he claims that the melancholy Burton identifies is more like an individual suffering that may lead not only to isolation and loneliness but also to some kind of reflectiveness and creativity. Tristesse , on the other hand, as seen in Levi-Strauss's Tristes Tropiques , is more like a bourgeois Western guilt felt when visiting the tropics; it's the conflicted discomfort experienced while enjoying the pleasure of easy sunshine. Hiiziin , on the other hand, is uniquely felt in Istanbul; it is a collective sense of sadness, a feeling of loss and defeat so entrenched that people do not even try to fight against it. They bear and, in fact, embrace this suffering as a sign of their dignity.</page><page sequence="7">The Chronotope of Istanbul in Orhan Pamuk's Memoir Istanbul 661 Pamuk tries to list various reasons for this sadness, and they range from an Islamic and particularly Sufi mourning for alienation from God, to rampant poverty, to the omnipresence of dilapidated buildings, to the centrality of romantic sadness in songs and poetry. The fact that street lights are not bright adds to this as do the black-and- white photos, films, and cheap reproductions of gravures about Istanbul that make the inhabitants of the city visually encounter their own sadness. But its most important cause is the historical loss of empire. Although he does not exactly explain what this means (for that, we have to turn to his sources in Beyatli and Tanpinar, from whom he borrows this historical argument), his hiizUn is a nostalgia for a past that was better, richer, and happier and that is forever gone. The concrete political and ideological implications of this are left untouched as he concentrates purely on the emotion and its pervasiveness as well as on the literary and artistic ways this sadness is recirculated. What Pamuk describes is his experiences of sadness, most poignantly his helplessness as a child caught in the squabbles between his parents. Both the events he talks about and the way he talks of them make these emotions identifiable for the reader. The longing of a child for a family he has lost - which is the trauma Pamuk experiences - provides the personal illustration of the general nostalgia felt for an empire after its loss. Pamuk' s personal perspective as a small child allows a venue to this collective pain, highlighting only the emotional aspect of the experience rather than its causes, which are sometimes given as endless lists and which seem to announce in their desperation that they are not adequate as explanations. This personalization from a child's perspective, however, allows the readers to understand and experience the historical loss through their identification with and sympathy for the child's suffering. By setting this concrete example of the pain of a child longing for family togetherness and harmony as an emotional parallel for what Istanbullus felt after the loss of the empire, Pamuk turns Ottoman history into a story of the dissolution of another family like his, albeit more illustrious and powerful. By the same token, the troubles and loss of the fortune of his family are narrated like the decline of the Ottoman dynasty. What allows the biographical story to serve as a key for the historical one is the iden- tical emotional coloring and meaning accorded to Istanbul in both. While Pamuk's life story illustrates the experience of sadness in narrative terms, the historically analytical part of the book traces the various stages of the association of Istanbul with melancholy. This latter turns out to be a palimpsestic and intertextual reading of previous authors of various genres who wrote about Istanbul as a site of sadness and loss. Glossing over the differences between different emotions of sadness, Pamuk conducts his investigation of these texts basically through the framework of the story of the young man as an artist, which begins with his birth and ends with the declaration of his vocation as a writer. Although this central Kiinstlerroman moves the narrative forward through its bio- graphical outline, it is not really anchored in history or concrete time. We get some dates that indicate the book covers the first twenty-two years of Pamuk's life, but there is not a particularly clear chronology or a definite sense of what was happening historically. For example, we hear that the prime minister was Adnan Menderes (1899-1961) through the association of his first name Adnan with the name of Pamuk's uncle Gokhan because they rhyme. Pamuk recounts a funny episode in which, as a five-year-old, he insisted that the prime minister was his uncle because of the resemblance of the two names with their</page><page sequence="8">662 Sibel Erol rhyming ending. But we learn nothing about the period of this first prime minister from the Democratic Party, who was elected in the first two-party elections held in Turkey in 1950 and who was hanged after the 1960 coup. Pamuk personalizes the historical reference as an illustration of the kind of associative slippage to which he is prone. Nor do we hear anything about the new constitution this coup produced, Turkey's entry into the Korean War, or Turkey's attempts to become a NATO member, all of which were taking place around the time of the beginning of the book's narrative in 1952. This lack of concrete temporal markers and connections allows the emphasis to remain on the internal life that the anguished young hero guiltily prefers to the external one lived with others. He feels that he is pretending to be somebody else when he is with other people. He describes this discomfort by saying, "I'd feel ashamed, afraid, terrorized, and terrified of being marked as alien" (p. 309). The remedy for him is to withdraw into an inner life, which unfolds when he shuts out the world and is only indirectly described in the book as the "second world" (as opposed to the "first world" of routine and the reality principle); he delineates its territory when he says that he went into his room and locked his door, but ultimately the book ends up being about this inner world. The fact that the twin narrative about the idea of Istanbul is developed in an intellectual discursive framework expands the terrain of this inner life. While tracing the association of melancholy with Istanbul in the writings of the other authors, Pamuk treats them as his doubles who had their own inner turmoil and struggles, whether about love, sexuality, or youthful ambition. The shared attention in both Istanbul narratives to analysis and reflection as well as to a common feeling of melancholy helps turn the focus from the external to the internal. Ironically, the book that purports to be about a real place that is visually captured in many photographs ends up being framed through a narrative of inner life and defined by emotion. Pamuk's preoccupation with and reading of the chronotope of Istanbul through literary works in the second plotline validates the final and surprising revelation that he wants to be a writer, not a painter, in the biographical plot. Thus, the independent second story line about Istanbul is absorbed into the logic of the biographical story whose culmination offers Pamuk's own contribution to the concept of Istanbul. The resolution of the biographical story is worked out as Pamuk's conflict with each member of his family is either solved or explained. The sibling rivalry with his older brother, which weighed him down with feelings of shame and defeat, is resolved when his brother leaves for college. The problem with his father's disappearances is explained when he is discovered to be an adulterer living with another woman, experiencing the twin life that Pamuk imagined for himself. Pamuk has a close but difficult relationship with his mother, which shapes his early life. In a way, the book is about his separation from his mother, the main person who initiated him into loving Istanbul. Pamuk finally declares his independence from her by running out into the streets of Istanbul and rebelling against her expectations that he become an architect. The streets of Istanbul and personal freedom triumph as Pamuk drops out of the university, acting on a truth he learned in elementary school that school explains nothing about life. In the end, his locked room opens up to encompass all of Istanbul because he now finds the solitude he once found in his room in the different neighborhoods of the entire city, which he identifies with after his experience of an awakening.</page><page sequence="9">The Chronotope of Istanbul in Orhan Pamuk's Memoir Istanbul 663 THE AWAKENING AND THE SHIFT TO THE PERSONAL AS CAUSE OF HUZUN The most important resolution of the book comes from the reversal of Pamuk's rela- tionship with Istanbul as a result of the moment of epiphany in the biographical plot line, which awakens Pamuk to his vocation with the discovery of his artistic material. The stories of Istanbul and of Pamuk's life are not only parallel plot lines but are also embedded in each other. Pamuk offers his life as both the product and the embodiment of Istanbul through the argument that he has always lived in Istanbul and, therefore, is marked by Istanbul in the way that some writers are defined by exile. Yet, he can't help but reveal the dwindling of his family's fortunes, the disintegration of the relationship between his parents, the darkness of the atmosphere in his grandmother's museum house where curtains are always half-drawn, and his own sense of alienation from his surroundings - his own depression, one might say. The terms of this cause and effect relationship are reversed in the penultimate chapter of the book, which contains "the center" of Istanbul. According to Pamuk's recent explanation, "the center" is the point to which all the narrative flows and which unlocks the mystery of what it means.14 He prepares us for the existence of such a center when he indicates he had to make a choice about how to tell his story, which turns out to be between the perspectives of a naive vs. sentimental writer. He says he could have written it in the form of a fairy tale, mystifying his writing as an unconscious and spontaneous act of creativity by a naive author who is not in control of what he produces: "Then, when I was twenty-two, I seem to have begun writing novels without knowing why" (p. 8). He explains why he opted not to this and instead wrote his memoir from the viewpoint of a consciously in-control sentimental author who shapes his narrative with deliberate intention: Beautiful though it is, I find the language of the epic unconvincing, for I cannot accept that the myths we tell about our first lives prepare us for the second lives that are meant to begin when we awake. Because - for people like me, at least - that second life is none other than the book in your hand (p. 8, emphasis added). This distinction between "first life" and "second life" should not be confused with the other important categorization of "first world" and "second world" (which refers to the opposition between the real world of shared routine and the world of the imagination), although the "second life" begins when the "second, inner world" of the imagination becomes the guiding force of a conscious life. The terms "second world" and "second life" are both coordinates of inner life, but the first is a designation of space that grows to include the whole of Istanbul, and the second is a designation of time that captures and embodies that growth. They finally intersect at the moment of Pamuk's epiphany, opening up his second life dominated by the second world's power of imagination, and changing his relationship with Istanbul. The date of this rebirth into his "second life" is given almost as a full date: "around noon on a day in March 1972" (pp. 346-47). The coupling of the month and year recalls the formality of the birth date in the "first life," but this time the date is not complete since it is only a second birth. Pamuk is extremely depressed because his girlfriend is sent away, he has lost his love of painting, and he is constantly fighting with his mother about</page><page sequence="10">664 Sibel Erol his future. He decides to cut class and take a ride on the ferry because this is the typical consolation for heroes of all black-and-white movies as well as for the intellectuals of Tanpinar's 1949 novel Huzur (Peace). He thinks, "By looking at Istanbul, so much more defeated, ruined and sorrowful, I would forget my own pain" (p. 350). He boards an old commuter ferry going to the Golden Horn and immediately experiences "this sense of belonging, this sense of sitting now in the heart of the city" (p. 346). He also feels that while that specific day in 1972 goes on above the bridge, he descends into a different kind of indeterminate and subjective time on the water. He notices, "Here, in the world below, we belonged to an older, broader, weightier time" (p. 346). This time slowly moves back to take him first to the time of Beyatli and Tanpinar with the observation "I'd gone back thirty years" (p. 347); then into a black-and-white movie from an earlier date, "This midday scene seemed, like the Istanbul views I saw in disintegrating old movies" (p. 348); and, next, to the time of the French visitors a hundred years earlier, when he notices that the horse-drawn carriages on the shore "looked as finely and clearly drawn as in hundred-year-old postcards" (p. 348). By the time he comes to Usklidar and the Golden Horn, the site of Istanbul's conquest, with an awareness that "every strange memento seemed saturated with the poetic melancholy of lost imperial greatness and its historical residue" (p. 353), 15 he not only duplicates the physical journey of Mehmet the Conqueror in 1453 from the sea to the heart of Istanbul, but he also repeats that military conquest in psychological terms. Pamuk gains the authority to define what Istanbul is when he reconquers it in the spirit of Mehmet the Conqueror, who at twenty-one was about the same age as the twenty-year-old Pamuk reliving in 1972 a personal version of that historical victory. This artistic conquest is foreshadowed by a reference to its historical model in a special chapter entitled "Conquest or Decline? The Turkification of Constantinople" exactly at mid-point in the memoir.16 Pamuk's allusion to Sultan Mehmet is also an intertextual reference to the works of Beyatli and Tanpinar, who have mythologized the conquest of Istanbul as the city's foundational moment.17 Pamuk achieves this conquest by understanding the meaning of the city: "I imagined myself to be the only one who had unlocked the city's secret ; it had come to me as I watched through the windows of the Golden Horn ferry, and I had embraced the city as my own - no one had ever seen it as I did now!" (p. 353, emphasis added). The sense of community that enveloped him at the beginning of the journey ends with the declaration of his individuality and singularity, because he is the only one who has grasped the meaning of the city's heart: although this meaning is enigmatically left unexplained, we know by now that it is the city's hiizun. The book we are reading is the result of that insight, and the success of this conquest can be measured by the popularity of the image and to the extent it is embraced as an uncontestable truth by reading audiences worldwide. The young artist conquers the city by allowing himself to be conquered by it. He tells us at the outset, "For me, Istanbul has always been a city of ruins and of end-of- empire melancholy. I've spent my life either battling with this melancholy or (like all Istanbullus) making it my own" (p. 6). It is during this ferry ride that he finally gives in to the feeling and accepts it. He says, "I lost myself in Istanbul. So it was that I finally came to relax and accept the hiizun that gives Istanbul its grave beauty, the hiizun that is its fate" (p. 352). It is through this acceptance of the city's ethos and his identification with it that he finally conquers both the city and its hiizun. The young artist's interaction</page><page sequence="11">The Chronotope of Istanbul in Orhan Pamuk's Memoir Istanbul 665 with the city is the kind of lovers' embrace often depicted in black-and-white films, in the shot of the hero and heroine running toward each other in slow motion and finally throwing themselves into each other's arms. In allowing himself to be penetrated by the city's hiiziin and in literally penetrating its heart both in his physical journey to the Golden Horn and in his moment of grasping its essence, he enacts this embrace with the city and it becomes both a communion and a consummation. Before he depicts this moment, Pamuk juxtaposes two traditions in which awakening means opposite things and which are thus narrated for different ends. Pamuk explains that in the typical Turkish moment of epiphany, the protagonist finally accepts the defeat that was his fate from the beginning. Pamuk juxtaposes this passive resignation with its Western opposite as expressed in the rebellion of Balzac's canonical hero Rastignac: "No such feeling operates in heroes like Balzac's Rastignac, who in his furious ambition comes to convey, even glorify, the spirit of the modern city" (p. 104). The reference here is to Rastignac's challenge to his city Paris, especially epitomized in his war call at the end of Pere Goriot : Rastignac, reste seul, fit quelques pas vers le haut du cimetiere et vit Paris tortueusement couche le long des deux rives de la Seine ou commengaient a briller les lumieres. Ses yeux s'attacherent presque avidement entre la colonne de la place Vendome et le dome des Invalides, la ou vivait ce beau monde dans lequel il avait voulu penetrer. II langa sur cette ruche bourdonnante un regard qui semblait par avance en pomper le miel, et dit ces mots grandioses : "A nous deux maintenant !" (emphasis added)18 Unlike Turkish heroes, Rastignac is ready to take on the ruthlessly capitalist but also exciting life of Paris, where mobility and success are difficult, but possible. Words such as avidement , penetrer, langa , grandiose show the youthful ebullience and aggressiveness of Rastignac's ambitions, which culminate in his direct challenge to the city as he looks on its most upscale neighborhoods (unlike Pamuk and other hiizun writers, who favor the poorest). On the ferry, Pamuk's moment of awakening also involves the decision of which tradition this epiphany is going to be narrated in. Flooded with the city's hiizun , he considers how a typical Turkish hero, "so destined to lose 'in life and in love,"' would cede to it (p. 351). This thought leads to a pause of doubt and a dramatic moment of reversal as we see in the following sequence: "To say such a thing would be to talk in the language of Turkish melodrama" . . . " - and it won't do to use the city's melancholy to explain away my own" (pp. 350-51). Although he accepts the city's hiiziin , Pamuk refuses to be defeated and defined by it. He turns to the Western model and embraces Rastignac's challenge, announcing his conquest of the city by his insight into its essential meaning. Pamuk's descriptions of his anger and ambition, in this and the following chapter, with phrases like "unchecked ardor" (p. 353), "unbounded love and anger" (p. 360), and "this dark spirit" (p. 360), follow this identification with Rastignac,19 which makes available for him an appropriate language of expression. In the end, he writes, "My fury gave me a dizzying vitality that pushed me out of myself; I felt a wondrous ambition - so vast it surprised even me - to leave the house and run out into the street" (p. 363, emphasis added). This forceful language of "fury, vitality, and ambition" pushes him out of the Turkish tradition toward a hybridization of Eastern and Western traditions, which he has already discovered at the core of hiiziin .</page><page sequence="12">666 Sibel Erol Pamuk also references another famous Western hero of awakening, Stephen Dedalus, in order to deepen the artistic nature of his epiphany by following the blueprint pro- vided by Joyce. Pamuk's spiritual communion with his city, which becomes his subject matter, is modeled on that of Stephen Dedalus with his city, Dublin. Stephen is another character who defies his mother; he leaves his family home, Ireland, and the church against his mother's wishes. Stephen's epiphany happens slowly over the course of a walk by the sea. First he announces the end of his youth and declares his vocation in writing: "His soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood, spurning her grave clothes. Yes! Yes! Yes! He would create proudly out of the freedom and power of his soul, as the great artificer whose name he bore, a living thing, new and soaring and beautiful, impalpable, imperishable."20 Toward evening, he encounters a young girl wading in the sea, looking like a seabird, and her image is transmuted into Ireland's in his mind. Stephen has a silent spiritual encounter with her, absorbing her figure as the subject matter of his future writing: "Her image had passed into his soul forever and no word had broken the holy silence of his ecstasy. Her eyes had called to him and his soul had leapt to the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!" (p. 156). Like Joyce's writer character, Pamuk's young self discovers his subject matter of Istanbul in a euphoric and wordless encounter by the sea between two spirits, one of which belongs to a place. Similarly, the experience creates a mandate. Pamuk says, "Once I mastered this new poetic outlook, I chased with unchecked ardor after anything and everything connected with the city" (p. 353). In ambitiously pursuing his topic, Pamuk's hero also incorporates the more openly confrontational tone of young Rastignac's encounter with his city because the former's relationship with Istanbul is also one of power. These implied comparisons of Pamuk's awakening to its literary others add the present tense of literature and literary analysis to the indeterminate present of the narration. PAMUK AS THE CAUSE OF HUZUN IN ISTANBUL The fifty-year-old narrator of the memoir not only portrays the triumphant moment of the epiphany of his younger self who felt his trilling uniqueness but also shows that this naive self-important discovery is the work of projection. He comments with the ironic hindsight and wisdom of his age that cities are only what we see in them; our inner life offers the only perspective through which we can experience a city. He says of his past, "The view looked troubled then because I myself was troubled. I poured my soul into the city's streets, and there it still resides" (p. 346). At the end, he writes, "But here we have come full circle, for anything we say about the city's essence says more about our own lives and our states of mind. The city has no center other than ourselves" (p. 349). He accepts responsibility for the sadness he locates in Istanbul and subordinates the Istanbul argument to his biography by contextualizing the epiphany of his younger self in the unhappiness of his own life then. Pamuk here accepts that what he has written about is his Istanbul: his take on, his interpretation of, the city. While undercutting his younger self s moment of self-discovery with this ironic consciousness, the mature narrator simultaneously legitimizes his former self s claim to authority over the city as its voice and bard. The memoir ends with the declaration of the young man's subject matter and his artistic vocation in writing. The meaning of this claim</page><page sequence="13">The Chronotope of Istanbul in Orhan Pamuk's Memoir Istanbul 667 to authority is dramatized and justified in the analytical work of the mature narrator, who constructs the tradition in which he will place himself and in terms of which he will claim that Istanbul is a site of htiztin. His genealogy of this association, traced through authors who were looking for "an image of Istanbul" (p. 107), demonstrates how the chronotope of Istanbul is developed. Although he makes a general and generalizing claim about the connection between Istanbul and htizun on the basis of the framework and the history he creates, Pamuk also underlines the personal motivations and circumstances of the authors - including himself - who not only contributed to the various stages in the collective development of the chronotope but also left their personal signature on it. THE CREATION OF THE CHRONOTOPE The French Models According to Pamuk's analysis, this story of Istanbul's htiztin originates in the orientalist journeys of European, especially French, travelers to Istanbul in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Because they learned from each other's accounts, a shared itinerary soon emerged for these sojourns that included taking in the harem, the mosques, the Karagoz traditional theater performances at the coffee houses, the slave market, and the sultan after the Friday prayer. The Europeans frequently stayed at the same lodgings and were taken around by the same guides, always hankering after the experience of the exotically different. There was a shared orientalist script that shaped their experience, which they also reproduced in their own writing because they mostly wrote about those things that their audience back home would find interesting. Arriving in 1843, Nerval (1808-55) added a twist to the shared script: he was the first to have an awareness of the poorer quarters and to observe that the tourist itinerary did not include what he called "the backstage." The poverty of these neighborhoods added to the melancholy of his writing, but, as Pamuk observes, "Since Nerval is identified with melancholy in French literary culture, one might assume he'd found melancholy in Istanbul" (p. 220). There was also the matter of Nerval's depression; he in fact committed suicide in 1855 "after several stays in insane asylums" (p. 220).21 Nerval's friend Gautier (181 1-72) built on the former's discovery by seeking out the back streets and poor neighborhoods, looking for the picturesque in them during his stay in 1852. Pamuk writes that Gautier "had the sort of eye that could find melancholic beauty amid dirt and disorder" (p. 228). But he was depressed, too, and had come to Istanbul just two years after a "spell of madness" (p. 220), which made him disposed toward melancholy. Pamuk suggests that Nerval and Gautier - by this focus on poor neighborhoods that they described in melancholic terms conditioned by both their literary training and their personal psychological states - were the first authors to make the association between Istanbul and sadness and thus unknowingly invented the Istanbul chronotope. Successors like Flaubert (1821-80) and Andre Gide (1869-1951) lived the meaning of the chronotope but - again for personal reasons that Pamuk carefully underlines - were disdainful of, rather than enthralled by, the poverty and sadness they encountered in their respective visits in 1852 and 1914.22</page><page sequence="14">668 Sibel Erol The Turkish Models In the next stage of the chronotope, Turkish modernists Yahya Kemal Beyatli (1884 - 1958) and Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar (1901-62) took this picture of sadness, especially building on its association with the outlying poor neighborhoods, and framed it in historical terms. Their decision was likewise shaped by their personal circumstances and aspirations. They shared the individual melancholy of these Western authors and wanted to write in the latter' s style. But they knew that in order to be authentic, they had to write about an original and local subject. They focused on the historical transition and social transformation from the Ottoman Empire to the Turkish Republic, which was officially declared in 1923. They converted the individualistic artistic melancholy they admired in their predecessors into a shared social sensibility caused by the loss of a 600-year-old empire. They not only made Istanbul the site of a collective and social sadness but also emphasized the historicity in the chronotope, by adding to the elements of place and worldview a sense of historical urgency and depth that turned time into causality. By focusing on their own lived experience and contemporary history from about the 1910s to the late 1950s, they argued that Turkish society, while undergoing a cultural, political, and social transformation during this period, felt a collective longing for the coherence and way of life of the empire that had ended. Thus, Istanbul was connected with htizun , caused by the loss of empire, and associated with the early period of the republic in their writing. This is the chronotope that Pamuk identifies in their work and directly borrows from them without even changing their historical argument, which was relevant for their period of transition but is rather anachronistic by the time of Pamuk' s writing. The paucity of references to contemporary historical events and dates relevant to Pamuk's own life helps hide the fact that the chronotope he is employing is not exactly applicable. By transplanting a historical argument to a life story largely stripped of actual dates, he psychologizes the chronotope, rendering it simultaneously abstract and personal. During the period from the 1950s to the 1970s, the biographical time span that Pamuk covers in his memoir, it is most certain that people were not living their days with a nostalgia for an empire that was gone, in most cases before they were born. It is not possible to say with certainty whether they experienced the collective mourning of htizun either. If they were sad, it was more likely because of the daily economic problems they encountered and the two military coups they suffered in 1960 and 1971. In contrast, we can certainly say that by his own account, Pamuk was sad and even depressed during this period of his life in Istanbul23 and that the reason was the dissolution of the empire he was part of, that is, his family, whom he metaphorically links with the Ottoman dynasty throughout.24 Talking about the emotional and financial disintegration of his family, he says, "It was a long time coming, arriving by a circuitous route, but the cloud of gloom and loss spread over Istanbul by the fall of the Ottoman Empire had finally claimed my family too" (p. 17). Here Pamuk is indicating that he experienced his family's disintegration as an emotionally parallel experience to the loss of the empire felt by its subjects in the early 20th century. In this comparison, he also reveals how he uses the htiztin schema as it pertains to his life: that is, not as a historical explanation but as a psychological comparison based on the analogous and metaphorical relationship between his family and the Ottoman dynasty. He is claiming that the htizun</page><page sequence="15">The Chronotope of Istanbul in Orhan Pamuk's Memoir Istanbul 669 he experienced as a result of his family's loss is on par with, or even the same emotional experience as, the hiiziin that Beyatli and Tanpinar associated with the loss of empire. By using the historical content in the chronotope he adopts, metaphorically rather than literally, Pamuk is making it self-reflective because what it explains is Pamuk's own biography and psychology. Pamuk's use of the Istanbul chronotope is self-referential not only in the way it folds back onto his biography and serves as an explanation of his personal psychology but also in the way it gestures toward the texts he interprets and incorporates in his crystallization of the chronotope. In its reverential intertextuality, Pamuk's work pays homage to Beyatli and Tanpinar, especially by keeping their historical argument intact as a cipher or a sort of time capsule that cannot be directly absorbed by his own story. But his allusions to them also refer back to or emplot his professional and literary accomplishments and become a part of his biography. Through a flaunted use of intertextuality, Pamuk pays his debt to his masters as a disciple would modestly cite his silsile (concatenation or family tree of spiritual masters) in a medieval guild initiation ceremony. But as the person who constructs the chronotope of Istanbul as hiiziin , and decides through whom the genealogy develops, he both carves out and names the tradition that legitimizes his work and professional aspirations and declares his mastery over the masters with whom he associates himself by being able to name them. His intertextual allusions to Beyatli and Tanpinar bear this double accent of respectful acknowledgement and self-referential appropriation as biographical explanation. Beyatli and Tanpinar are the direct source of the historical argument Pamuk presents about hiiziin as well as of other primary features of the memoir. The original historical thesis is Beyatli's, whose every poem contains the world hiiziin , although the reasons for the sadness he refers to range from romantic discontent to homesickness to approaching death and, famously, to the loss of a coherent and organic sense of time and belonging in the past associated with the empire. Tanpinar takes this historical diagnosis and its basic vocabulary from his mentor and lifelong friend and develops it in Bes Sehir (Five Cities, 1946), refining it in terms of the cultural and civilizational confusion that the double pull of the past and future exerted on a Turkish society in transition after the end of empire.25 He is the one who has argued that the loss of empire is most acutely felt in Istanbul, because the architectural and institutional remnants of the empire are most visible there and its inhabitants live in the shadow of a glorious past. But his chronotopic investigation in Bes Sehir , which is the primary model for Pamuk's memoir, moves on to four other cities, symbolically ending in Ankara, the capital of the new nation. Tanpinar's examination of Istanbul is not only relational to other cities but also acknowledges that each generation or even person will have a different understanding of Istanbul. He confesses that there might be an aesthetic pleasure in hiiziin and thus, like Beyatli, makes its meaning more multidimensional, and less concrete, than how Pamuk ends up using this word. Looking into the future, and for a remedy, Tanpinar argues that this nostalgic pain will go away as soon as a new economic paradigm emerges to replace the artisanal production that sustained the disappearing mahalle (neighborhood) life and economy. Pamuk narrows and fixes both of these authors' definition of hiiziin and their understanding of Istanbul, deflating the historicity of their historical argument, thereby rendering the terms hiiziin and Istanbul portable as souvenirs from these previous texts that are used as narrative cornerstones and literary props of his own biography.</page><page sequence="16">670 Sibel Erol Pamuk tips his hat to Beyatli and Tanpinar not only in the way he extends their usage of hiizun to have it refer to and explain his life but also in the dual form of his memoir, its split into biography and essay. This hybrid form is a marriage of the genres and techniques that Beyatli and Tanpinar have used in writing about Istanbul. The analytical essay part of the memoir is inspired by Tanpinar's Bes Sehir, whose Istanbul chapter investigates the historical, economic, aesthetic, and anecdotal story of Istanbul roughly from the 15 th to the early 20th century. The autobiographical part is directly informed by the conventions of Beyatli's poetry, where Istanbul and its neighborhoods emerge as the preserver of Beyatli's personal history and as the more abstract and general embodiment of various stages of human life such as youth, middle age, and old age. Beyatli treats the neighborhoods of Istanbul as containers holding the memories of what happened in them intact, so that one can go and relive those experiences or return to those times by revisiting the places. In terms of his personal life story, he sees the places of his happiness with his beloved as both markers and preservers of their past. In his eponymous poem about the neighborhood of Fenerbah9e, he writes:26 "I saw it yesterday at Fenerbahge / Spring was wrapped in an enormous emerald / ... in this deep emerald / 1 and the beloved are present."27 In "The Past Summer," another poem of nostalgic regret and remembrance, the sea becomes the keeper of the beloved's image: "Look at the calm waters of the bay, you'll see: / A night from the past stays in the deep / The moon ... the enormous roses . . . and your best reflection. / In short, that dream endures in its place intact."28 Other neighborhoods serve as the loci of various stages of human life. For example, a place on an island in the sea of Marmara - Viranbag, in the poem named after it - becomes the site of the end of summer, day, and youth concurrently: "Ah, in that boundless age (that is, youth) / The last day of the summer is spent at Viranbag."29 Another neighborhood, Kanlica, in "The End of September" serves as the repository of old age and impending death: "The days become shorter. The old of Kanlica / Remember past autumns one by one."30 This anthropomorphic and chronotopic conceptualization of Istanbul superimposes a biographical plotline upon the city map, which Beyatli furthermore personalizes as the repository and embodiment of the various events of his life. In his treatment of Istanbul as the locus, the imprint, and the keeper of his life story, Beyatli already treats the city as the album or the book of his life, where various neighborhoods serve the function of palimpsestic markers of life stages or turning points in much the same way as the portraits of family members on the walls of Pamuk's grandmother's house. Pamuk's act of linking his life story to Istanbul and treating the city as both his double and his very self are based on Beyatli's precedent. Beyatli views Istanbul not only as the background upon which his life, or human life in general, is reflected and into which it is absorbed (a common exhortation in his poems is "to see" this reflection) but also and consequently as a living entity whose own life story is synonymous with Ottoman history, whose birth coincides with its conquest by Mehmet the Conqueror. Several of Beyatli's poems celebrate the neighborhood of Uskiidar as the privileged witness of this magical event: the city's Ottoman birth. The poem "Uskiidar Who Saw the Conquest of Istanbul" is a case in point: "A hundred ships passed to the Golden Horn by land / What a dawn it was while the battle of the last day was being fought / Uskiidar, looking from the hills with tearful eyes / Saw that a hundred thousand angels flew to Istanbul / Kept this hidden, preserving it for centuries in her</page><page sequence="17">The Chronotope of Istanbul in Orhan Pamuk' s Memoir Istanbul 671 dream."31 Beyatli's celebration of the conquest is matched only by his mourning for its opposite in the loss of empire. Pamuk incorporates both of these pivotal turning points in Ottoman history into the narrative of his life as its emotional registers. He pays his respects to Beyatli by narrating the moment of the epiphany experienced by his younger self in terms of the conquest, however ironically, as well as by depicting the dissolution of his family in terms of the end of the empire. In Beyatli's conception, his own particular life, the more general span of human life that progresses from youth to old age, and Ottoman history coexist as three superimposed but separate layers, progressing upward in levels of abstraction and generalization in terms of the scope of the time they embody. These different time spheres correspond to different biographies of Istanbul that coexist, but don't intermingle, in Beyatli's writing: each poem dwells on only one of the time frames. In personalizing the historical time level as a metaphor for his own life, Pamuk borrows Beyatli's schema but, by reinterpreting and reshaping it, makes it his own, both to tell his own life story and to claim it as his own technique. Although the way he collapses these layers into each other is a distortion and contamination of Beyatli's schema, it is also strangely a return to the latter's original experience. Long before it emerged as a historical argument, Beyatli's hiiziin was quite personal: as an Ottoman from Macedonia, he witnessed firsthand the loss of the empire, emigrating to Thessaloniki with his family when he was fourteen and, upon his mother's death, arriving in Istanbul alone when he was seventeen.32 Pamuk's personalizing schema ends up doing justice to the spirit of this original and lived hiiziin. Pamuk similarly turns to Tanpinar as a formal model, not only in the kind of analysis inspired by Bes Sehir that constitutes "the biography of Istanbul" part of the memoir but also in demonstrating, fleshing out, and narrativizing the connection, the very identity of self and Istanbul he borrows from Beyatli. For this, he looks to Tanpinar's masterpiece Huzur , which he singles out as "the greatest novel ever written about Istanbul" (p. 105). In presenting the problem of hiiziin as the unresolved loss of the past and of the Ottoman heritage, Huzur , more than any other Tanpinar novel, reverberates with concepts, assertions, and images of Beyatli's poetry and historical arguments, which it footnotes, elaborates, and develops. At its core lies the hopeless love story of Miimtaz, a young academic, and Nuran, an older divorced mother, who try to substantiate and prove their love for each other through the evidence of their shared passion for the various neighborhoods and Ottoman monuments of Istanbul. During the summer they fall in love, the protagonists explore Istanbul, seeking its poorest and most forgotten neighborhoods, tekkes (dervish lodges), and mosques as if to create a prehistory for their love, as if to find a foundation for their future. Their emotions are mediated through songs, poetry, paintings, architecture, and the natural beauty of Istanbul in the summer, in an effort to turn these into souvenirs or permanent artifacts of their love. Their failure to inscribe this love in Istanbul, that is, to establish the correlation between Istanbul and their lives, dooms their affair. In his reading of this novel, Pamuk says they could not find huzur (peace) because they could not alleviate their hiiziin (p. 105). We can argue that this hiiziin is caused by their recognition that the Ottoman past and its monuments are inadequate to embody and represent a life story in a more modern time of duality, when the meaning of that past is erased and challenged by new realities such as the independence of a woman like Nuran. The Istanbul in the novel resists reflecting Nuran and Miimtaz's projection of their personal story, which was so easily absorbed and</page><page sequence="18">672 Sibel Erol preserved in Beyatli's poetry, because he wrote from a moment of closer proximity to the Ottoman past both in temporal and psychological terms. Pamuk also tempers his Beyatli-like identification of his life with Istanbul's through incorporating Tanpmar's critique of this close fit between life story and city history as a forced imposition and anachronistic reverie and narrates the story of his first love as if it is an episode from Huzur. Pamuk tries to recreate the basic plotline of that novel by using it as a template for the doomed relationship between his girlfriend and himself. Like Miimtaz, he takes his love to the poorest neighborhoods in Istanbul. Unlike Nuran, who was exhilarated by these outings, Pamuk 's love complains that she is already miserable and asks if they can go to the tea hour at the Hilton. During all these excursions, the only object that awakens her awe is the boza (a hot winter drink) glass that Ataturk drank from, which was kept unwashed since that event at the boza shop at Vefa (p. 333), showing that Pamuk' s generation is squarely located in the republican period with its own symbols and that the historical argument of htizun has long since expired. Despite this resistance on her part, Pamuk's girlfriend is revealed to be like Nuran in one respect: her lover's quest to capture her essence. Miimtaz, who approaches Nuran like a work of art, loves identifying something of her type, of what he defines as one of her gehre s (visages, manifestations) in famous pictures.33 He is enchanted to discover that she closely resembles Renoir's model in the painting The Reading Woman (Okuyan Kadin).34 A similar discovery is made by Pamuk about a former manifestation of his beloved. They originally start to meet so that Pamuk can paint her picture, lying down on the couch in the long skirt of her Albanian grandmother. When they later take refuge in the Museum of Painting and Sculpture at Taksim one afternoon, they discover a picture by the Turkish painter Halil Pasha ( 1 857-1939) entitled Reclining Woman (Yatan Kadin). To their amazement they see that Pamuk's girlfriend looks like the woman in the picture, not only in the costume and pose in which he had painted her but also in her facial features and expression (p. 336).35 The detail about the costume of Pamuk's girlfriend not only connects her to the painting directly but also echoes an episode from Huzur in which Nuran dresses in an authentic Turkish costume that Miimtaz buys for her in yet another of his attempts to define both her and their love. Pamuk also points to the similarity between Nuran and his girlfriend through the shared rhyme of Okuyan Kadin (Reading Woman) with Yatan Kadin (Reclining Woman), the pictures that are respectively their archetypal models. The linking of the two women (the heroine of Huzur and Pamuk's girlfriend) and their pictures with the two modifiers "okuyan" (reading) and "yatan" (reclining), which rhyme because they share the same suffix, brings us back full circle to Pamuk's association of the prime minister Adnan (Menderes) with his uncle Gokhan: not only do these pairs share the same rhyme "an," but they also illustrate the same mental operation. In the explanation of his Adnan-Gokhan association, Pamuk describes how he has a tendency to misinterpret similarity as identity. As ifllike/as relationships of resemblance and comparison turn in his mind into a conviction of is. In the case of the pictures, there is in fact a series of associations that work transitively both as displacement and replacement: Pamuk's girlfriend is like the woman in Halil Pasha's picture, who is like Nuran, who is like Renoir's model. Nuran's and Pamuk's girlfriend are similar because of their respective similarities to the pictures whose names rhyme with each other. What happens to hiiziin and its references in the memoir is a similar kind of transformation,</page><page sequence="19">The Chronotope of Istanbul in Orhan Pamuk's Memoir Istanbul 673 but, in this case, we are given the end product of the is/identity culminating statement that needs reading in reverse to arrive at the analogy at its base that caused the original leap of logic. Pamuk represents his personal unhappiness and depression, and the dissolution of his family, in terms of the historical argument of htizun in the chronotope he identifies but guides us to reading this direct association backward for the as if analogy or the metaphorical comparison it really is and originated in. The analogy hidden behind htizun is the following: Pamuk's family is like a/the Ottoman family. Its dissolution causes the same kind of pain that the loss of empire caused.36 He meanwhile illustrates the anachronism of the historical argument he builds, by directly showing and highlighting his own unhappiness, and even further by openly stating that he is projecting his own pain onto Istanbul just as his predecessors had done and by showcasing literary models and intertextual references that problematize the anachronism of his historical argument. By metaphorizing and reinterpreting the historical argument of htizun as personal sad- ness or more generally as the growing pains of youth described in his Ktinstlerroman , Pamuk fixes and uses the chronotope he identifies as a means of self-referential elabo- ration. This shift to the personal and the biographical also ironically becomes a return to and a restoration of the original cause of htiztin in the personal melancholy of writers like Nerval, Gautier, and Beyatli, who are Pamuk's doubles in his story of the devel- opment of the artist. Interestingly, Pamuk's psychologizing of the particular historical causation in htiztin , in the way he simultaneously particularizes/personalizes and gen- eralizes/abstracts the meaning of this term, has opened it up to the usage of others, as Pamuk's Turkish and international readers have demonstrated in the eagerness with which they have embraced htiztin as their self-diagnosis.37 The popularity of this term bears out Pamuk's belief in the power of identification in reading and also demonstrates his masterful use of it. Pamuk has updated the chronotope of htiztin , reopening it up for personal usage and literary recirculation.38 The reason for the latter is Pamuk's own emphasis on the literary in his presentation of the chronotope through allusions to a multiplicity of texts, foreign and Turkish, as the building blocks of his story that he has inherited and culled from previous narratives. All of these references are also self-reflexive and demonstrate Pamuk's own literary concerns, themes, and techniques, explaining his artistic credo: "We only acquire our own identity by imitating others" (p. 271). This requires us to recalibrate Pamuk's assertion of his relationship to Istanbul as: Istanbul: C'est les autres: C'est moi ,39 which is also an invitation to do the reverse and read Pamuk through his intertexts as a preserver of his predecessors.

Nollan (Evanston, 111.: Northwestern University Press, 2004), 75-93. 10In adapting here Flaubert's famous words about his character Madame Bovary, I am guided by Pamuk's self-declared identification with him (p. 287). 1 1 Bakhtin, "Forms of Time," 92. 12Here are some examples from the Turkish original: gegiverir, agiverince, oliivermesi, itiraf ediverir, soyleyiverirdi. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul: Hatiralar ve Sehir (Istanbul: Yapi Kredi, 2003), 52, 101, 115, 209, 259. 13 He writes, "If I am to convey the intensity of the hiizun that Istanbul caused me to feel as a child, I must describe the history of the city following the destruction of the Ottoman Empire" (p. 91). 14Pamuk, The Naive and the Sentimental Novelist 155-78. 15 This is a feeling he has not only on the ferry but also during his walks of immersion in the city later. This explains the absence of a specific date for the second birth, because the integration of its vision into life takes time and maturation. Pamuk narrates the ferry episode both as a linear story and as a collage of disparate times that lead both to it and from it. 16This chapter not only provides a historical framework for narrating Pamuk's discovery but also serves as an antidote to the young man's sense of uniqueness in two ways. First, it shows that something is never a single thing, but rather is always multiple things according to one's viewpoint. The title of "conquest or decline" does not pose a real juxtaposition. The historical event is both of those things when viewed from the different camps involved. Second, we see the destruction caused by an assessment of reality only from one angle because it lacks a useful critique. The plundering of Greek property in the 500-year celebration of the Turkish conquest is one such shameful example of a self-righteously narrow view of reality. The "March 1972" date expands the irony by placing the event exactly a year after the 12 March 1971 coup and serving as a check on any gushing celebration of military victory. 17This is a direct allusion to the episode in Huzur (Peace) where the protagonists Miimtaz and Nuran discuss how a young person should find his/her place in life, describing Mehmet the Conqueror as one of the models of youthful genius who cannot be emulated. Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar, A Mind At Peace , trans. Erdag Goknar (New York: Archipelago Books, 2008), 143. In Ender Giirol's translation, Inner Peace (Madison, Wise.: Turko-Tatar Press, 2007), it is on page 103. Sultan Mehmet also appears in Pamuk's The Black Book , trans. Maureen Freely (New York: Vintage International, 2006) as the favorite disguise of the protagonist Celal. x%Honore de Balzac , Pere Goriot (New York: St. Martins, 1968), 216. "Rastignac, now alone, took a few steps toward the top of the cemetery and saw Paris winding tortuously along both sides of the Seine, where the lights were beginning to come on. His eyes became glued almost greedily on the area between the column of the Place Vendome and the dome of the Invalides where the high society he wanted to penetrate lived. He threw a glance over that humming hive as if to suck its honey for a quick foretaste and said these ambitious words, 'It's you against me, now'" (my translation, from the French original of Balzac's Pere Goriot , p. 216). 19Pamuk writes in The Naive and Sentimental Novelist , "I went like Balzac's hero Rastignac, to look down on Paris from the heights of P&amp;re Lachaise Cemetery" (p. 125). 20 James Joyce, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (New York: St. Martins, 2006), 154. 21 Pamuk references Nerval throughout his oeuvre. For example, Jenny Colon, the actress who was the greatest love of Nerval's life, but who never requited his love, is invoked as a brand name (like a Kate Spade) for the upscale bag that Kemal buys from the sales girl Fusun, which captures the course and tragic outcome of his obsessive love for her in The Museum of Innocence, trans. Maureen Freely (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2009). 22 As Pamuk writes in the chapter on Andre Gide in his collection of essays Other Colors (trans. Maureen Freely [New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2007]), the negative views of Western writers were either censured and cut in translation by the Westernizing elite out of disbelief and pain or were internalized as part of Westernized</page><page sequence="21">The Chronotope of Istanbul in Orhan Pamuk's Memoir Istanbul 675 Turkish identity, creating a complicated internal conflict that Pamuk says he also suffers from (pp. 205- 13). 23 Pamuk presents his depression throughout, mostly in indirect ways, but there are direct references, such as this startling admission: "until the age of forty-five, it was my habit, whenever I was drifting in that sweet cloud between sleep and wakefulness, to cheer myself by imagining that I was killing people" (p. 21). 24 Here is an example of Pamuk's identification of his family as an Ottoman family: "until the year before I was born, different branches of the family had (as with many large Ottoman families) lived together in a stone mansion" (p. 9). Fittingly, as Pamuk mentions, most children in his family, including his brother and himself, are named after Ottoman royalty. 25 Both Beyatli and Tanpinar define hiiziin as the symptom of a cultural trauma, as a confusion over values caused by the loss of a former value and belief system that imbued life with meaning, but they have no desire to go back to the empire. There is a split between their cultural and political stances, which makes them difficult to be appropriated by different ideological camps. This is especially exemplified in their identification of the centrality of religion as the basis of the older harmonious way of life although they were not religious themselves. 26 All the following translations are my own, from Yahya Kemal Beyatli, Kendi Gok Kubbemiz (Istanbul: Istanbul Fetih Cemiyeti, 1999). 21 Dun Fenerbahge'de gordiim / Iri bir ziimriit igindeydi bahar . . . ; Bu derin ziimriitte / Biz de cananla beraber variz.

Kanlica'nin ihtiyarlari/Bir bir hatirlamakta gegen sonbaharlari. From the poem "Eyliil Sonu," in ibid., 59. 3 lKaradan sevkedilen yiiz gemi gegmis Halic'e; /Son giiniin cengi olurken, ne safakmis o safak, / Uskiidar, gdzleri dolmus, tepelerden bakarak, / Gormiis Istanbul' a yiizbin melegin ugtugunu; / Saklamis durmus, asirlarca hayalinde bunu. From the poem "Istanbul'un Fethini Goren Uskiidar," in ibid., 29. 32 Yahya Kemal Beyatli, Siyasi ve Edebi Hatiralarim (Istanbul: Istanbul Fetih Cemiyeti, 1973). 33Niiket Esen argues that Pamuk uses various points of view, such as that of his younger self and of foreign travelers, in order to get to the truth of Istanbul through its various surets (manifestations) and that his method is informed by the Islamic conception of essence as that which can never be directly grasped but only partially understood through its manifestations. Esen, "Sehrin Suretleri: Anlatisal Odak Olarak Istanbul," in Orhan Pamuk' un Edebi Dunyasi , ed. Esen and K1I19 (Istanbul: Iletisim, 2008), 265-72. Pamuk directly explores the discrepancy between face (representation) and essence through the theme of hurufism in the Black Book and his screenplay, Gizli Yiiz (The Secret Face) (Istanbul: Can Yayinlari, 1991). 34 Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar, Huzur (Istanbul: Dergah Yayinlan, 2004), 177 (p. 205 in the Goknar translation and p. 146 in Giirol). 35 Pamuk cheekily expands this appellation to a bawdy reference when he mentions his friends' envy at the fact that his girlfriend is sleeping with him. The real reclining woman in the book is the grandmother, who is directly connected with Renoir when she is described as "a round, relaxed woman from a Renoir painting" (p. 1 16). Time stopped for her with the death of her husband. Her reclining pose and her whole-morning breakfast ritual in bed, however luxurious, show her paralysis, which is so central to Pamuk's schema of hUziin. 36The transfer of shaping authority from Istanbul to Pamuk in the reversal of cause and effect between them is also reflected in the transformation of the meaning of hiiziin from a historical idea into a personal experience. The shifting of foreground and background in the representation of the two aspects of hiiziin as collective and historical on the one hand, and as personal and psychological on the other, is like the French painter Pierre Bonnard's reversal of interior and exterior spaces, accomplished by playing with the boundary-marking images of windows and doors in his pictures. Bonnard is mentioned as Pamuk's model on pp. 277, 328, 332, 336. 37cassandrapages.typepad.com/the_cassandra_pages/2006/10/hzn.html (accessed 16 May 201 1). The entry entitled Hiiziin at the cassandra pages, dated 5 October 2006, has generated a long list of international posts in which readers identify with hiiziin and point out that it exists in other cultures: "the Japanese would call hiiziin, Mono no aware; the Germans, Weltschmerz; African Americans, the Blues; perhaps the Hopi call</page><page sequence="22">676 Sibel Erol it Koyaanisqatsi ." In these examples, the word htizun , with its wider currency, facilitates the translation of different languages into each other while showing the commonality of the emotion. 38The translation of Huzur into English and German is one concrete example of this literary recirculation. Huzur has two English translations, which I have cited. The German translation is: Seelenfrieden, trans. Christoph Neumann (Zurich, Germany: Unionsverlag, 2008). 39It is no accident that in Istanbul Pamuk pays homage to the "MiÂ§" tense in Turkish (p. 8); this is a dialogic tense that allows one to speak in one's voice but always with the accent of other people, acknowledging that one's utterance already belongs to somebody else.</page></plain_text>
