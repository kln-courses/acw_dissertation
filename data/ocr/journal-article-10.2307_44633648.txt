FOR SEVERAL YEARS, anthropomorphic dummies representing three- and six-year-old children have been available and were used by laboratories in the U. S. and abroad, primarily for evaluation of child restraint systems used in automobiles. The better known models are the VIP-3C and VIP- 6C, produced by Alderson Research Laboratories, and their counterparts, the 492-03 and 492-06 by Sierra Engineering Company. ABSTRACT A three-part program was undertaken to establish an appropriate means of evaluating child restraints in automobile crashes. A standard seat was designed to provide a re- producible test base on which to evaluate child re- straint systems in dynamic testing. Developmental and evaluation data are presented, including child restraint performance tests. Results showed the standard seat to be a durable, repeatable, and economical test platform which provides a realis- tic base for evaluation of child restraint systems. Commercially available three- and six-year- old child dummies were evaluated for their anthro- pometric measurements and dynamic response characteristics in pendulum impact tests and simu- lated crashes in representative automobile-child seat restraint environments. Simulated crashes included 20 and 30 mph frontal and 20 mph side impacts on automobile and specially designed bench seats. Two types of child seats, the G. M. "Love Seat" and Chrysler "Mopar," were selected for testing as representative of belt and padding restraint types currently in use. The three-year-old child dummies were found to be capable of providing repeatable measurements of the head and chest accelerations and head deflec- tions in sled tests and to be sufficiently sensitive of detecting differences in the crash environments. Acceleration measurements on both six-year-old child dummies were found to contain resonances. An extensive sled testing was performed with child restraint systems to determine which of the two types of dummies simulate best the in-vivo response of primates and what criteria may be employed to measure the dummy response and the efficacy of child protection systems. Test results indicate that the mechanical test dummy, consisting of clearly defined adjustable body segments, is a better simulator than the lumped mass unadjustable type. Test results also indicate that current in- strumentation technology for application to in-vivo subjects is not adequately developed to permit consistent measurements in terms of "G" levels, injury criteria, etc. A better correlative measure between primates and mechanical child dummies is the head excursion, in both the forward- and lateral-collision modes. This is, however, limited to the first collision phase and is not valid for the rebound phase. The tested shield-type child re- straint exposed the occupant to potential risk of ejection during the rebound mode of the forward- collision phase and to substantial excursion in lateral collisions if the seat does not have provi- sions for limiting the lateral motion of the test subject. 3188</page><page sequence="2">These dummies, although appearing to be anthropometric ally good representations of three- and six-year-old children, are not as authentically constructed as their adult relatives. Very little was known about their dynamic characteristics, that is, about their ability to simulate a childTs response in crashes and provide quantitative measurements of the severity of the child crash en- vironments. With the use of these dummies, it became apparent that different results could be obtained by the use of different dummies and/or different automobile seats. With the purpose of resolving these problems, the NHTSA undertook a three-way program which included: 1. Development of a standardized auto- mobile seat on which child restraint systems could be evaluated. 2. Instrumentation and testing of child test dummies to determine if available dummies could be used in evaluation of child restraint systems, and 3. Comparative testing of dummies and primates for the purpose of selecting a dummy which best simulates a childTs response in a crash and thus would be most suitable for evaluation of child restraint systems. Development of a standardized seat was ac- complished by the HSRI, University of Michigan; evaluation of test dummies by Transportation Research Center of Ohio; and comparative in- vivo testing by the USAF Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory (AMRL), Wright- Patterson Air Force Base. Because of somewhat different objectives and requirements, for each phase of the program, this paper is structured in three separate parts. Each part contains the needed background, test data, discussions and conclusions. More detailed descriptions with additional data may be found in appropriate DOT reports pertaining to each pro- gram to be issued at a later date. PART I DEVELOPMENT OF A STANDARD BENCH VEHICLE SEAT Dr. Richard L. Stalnaker Highway Safety Research Center University of Michigan Jere Medlin National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Department of Transportation DURING EARLY STATIC testing of child seating systems, and particularly later when dynamic sled testing began, it became apparent that the measured performance was appreciably affected by the vehicle seats on which testing was accom- plished. This stemmed from the fact that dif- ferent vehicle seat designs and variabilities within a particular design provide different test- ing environments which have large influences on the test results, since the child and automobile seats become an integrated restraint system. Consequently, for quantitative evaluation of child restraint systems, particularly when this is done with anthropomorphic child dummies, it became essential to establish a defined test base that would produce a known and repeatable dyna- mic input to any given system to be tested. With this objective in mind, a program was undertaken to develop a standard test seat that would have structural response characteristics based on a domestic bench seat in large usage and meet the following other criteria: 1. Be a repeatable test platform; 2. Be capable of pro- ducing near-worse-case interface conditions for the evaluation of child restraints, and 3. Be economical and easily refurbishable for each test. DEFINITION OF PRODUCTION SEAT PROPERTIES The 1974 Chevrolet Impala production bench seat was selected as a base for development. Four samples of this seat were obtained and the follow- ing seat properties were measured: 1. Physical dimensions; 2. Geometry and location of the effective "hinge point" during high-speed impact; 3. Static and dynamic load -deflection pro- perties of seat back frame and cushion foams; 4. Performance of a child dummy occupant in a Ford "Tot-Guard" during dynamic sled tests. Impala seat back frame dynamic deformation tests were conducted in frontal impacts at 20 G, 3189</page><page sequence="3">3190 S. H. BACKAITIS, ET AL. 30 mph level with the seat frame targeted for ease of point tracking during testing. The seat appears to have hinge points at the base of the seat back and at approximately two-thirds of the height of the back. Seat cushion dynamic load deflection characteristics were also determined during sled tests with a 31.2 lb mass suspended against the seat and with an accelerometer mounted at its center of gravity. The combined performance of the seat foam and seat frame under dynamic load- ing were also obtained in these tests. The Ford "Tot-Guard" was mounted on the production seat with a Sierra 492-03 three-year- old size child dummy. Sled runs were made to observe foam padding and metal frame deforma- tion interactions with the child restraint system during impacts.

Rigid seat pan and seat back structures. 2. Simulation of production seat pan and cushion stiffness characteristics by specially designed seat cushions. 3. Idealization of production seat back deflection characteristics as a rotation about a single hinge point. 4. Rigid lateral response of the seat struc- ture to side loads. 5. Control of both seat back rotation and seat back cushion response within certain deflec- tion limits by easily replaced, low cost, deform- able elements. In construction of the standard seat, a rigid frame was fabricated for both the seat pan base and the seat back, using welded, tubular frame construction. The seat back and the seat base are two separate structures with the seat back being joined to the base by means of pillow block bearings on each side which define the axis of rotation of the seat back during loading. The re- sistance to seat back motion was achieved by means of two replaceable aluminum bars loaded in a three-point bending mode. The bar diameter, the effective lever arm of the seat back link, and the distance between bar support blocks were the three variables that could be easily modified to change the effective stiffness of the seat back. The foam cushions for the seat back and the seat were fitted into heavy vinyl cloth zippered bags with plywood face panels in the bags to allow bolted attachment to the seat frames. Seat belt attachment points were also incorporated in the base frame in the same position as in the 1974 Chevrolet Impala with the seat adjusted to the longitudinal midposition. The specifications for the selected seat foams are shown in Table 1. A composite of four inches of Foam #2021 over two inches of Foam #2028 were found necessary to duplicate the performance of the Impala cushions. This performance duplication appears to be valid for up to 5 1/2 in of cushion deflection. Fig. 1 is a dimensional side view of the resulting standard seat design. DESIGN CHECK TESTS As in the case of the Impala seat, the "Tot- Guard" seat was also used to determine its inter- action with the standard seat. Test conditions and resulting system interaction data are given in Table 2 for both seats. The head excursions of a child dummy in the "Tot-Guard" are essentially the same on the Impala and the standard seats, with 25. 0 in and</page><page sequence="4">PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF CHILD DUMMIES 3191 ' v' ' ^ ^ X' w.

Peak resultant accelerations for both the head and chest are lower with the standard seat possibly due to the generally softer child restraint interaction with the leading edge of the seat cushion frame as the seat cushion foam bottoms. Seat back deflection angles average 15. 1 deg for the production seat and 14. 4 deg for the stan- dard seat. Test A-752 was not used in the comparison because the dummy* s chin struck the MTot-Guardłł shield. This resulted in a significantly lower head excursion and a slightly submarining condition. STANDARD SEAT PERFORMANCE VERIFICATION Comparative performance tests using various child restraint systems were conducted on the standard and production seats. The following ob- servations were made from these tests: 1. Comparison of data with the Strolee child restraint was questionable because the child seat structure collapsed in both tests. However, this indicates that the standard seat will reproduce a child restraint failure in the same manner as the production seat. 2. Tests with the Chrysler "Mopar" child restraint produced similar data on both the stan- dard and production seats. Head excursion varia- tion was less than two inches. This is considered to be a reasonable amount in view of the fact that initial dummy positioning is a large factor in head travel. 3. Tests with the GM child łłLove Seat" produced close agreement of peak head and chest resultant accelerations for both seats, although the head excursion was 3 inches larger on the standard seat. The reduced seat back deflection caused by the use of an over-the-back strap was also comparable for both the Impala and standard seats. The GM child "Love Seat" was used for side impact comparison tests. In this mode, the stan- dard seat produced lower peak accelerations for the head and chest. The head excursions were essentially identical with an average of 16. 2 in for the Impala and 16. 8 in for the standard seats. The Chrysler "Mopar" child restraint was used for rear impact comparisons. The accel- erations are similar for the production and stan- dard seats. The horizontal head excursions average 9. 1 in for the Impala seat and 8. 3 in for the standard seat. However, the vertical head excursion is considerably lower for the standard seat indicating a smaller tendency for the dummy to ramp-up the seat back during impact. This occurred in spite of a larger seat back deflection angle than that of the production seat, which should have increased the ramping tendency. CONCLUSIONS 1. The static and dynamic testing indicate that the standard seat as designed is a durable, repeatable test platform that closely simulates the static and dynamic impact characteristics of the 1974 Chevrolet Impala bench seat. 2. Child restraint tests on the standard seat tend to give slightly lower head and chest peak resultant accelerations than comparable tests on the production seat. 3. Head excursion values for the Ford</page><page sequence="5">3192 S. H.

PART n PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF CHILD DUMMIES Vladislav G. Radovich National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Department of Transportation Mahesh P. Shah Transportation Research Center of Ohio PROGRAM OBJECTIVES During FY 1974-1975, a program was under- taken with the purpose of determining if the com- mercially available child dummies could be properly instrumented and used to evaluate the injury-reduc- ing potential of automobile -child restraint environ- ments during crashes. It was assumed that the measurements of the head and chest accelerations and head motions would provide sufficient informa- tion for this purpose. The testing and evaluation program was formulated to include the following three tasks: 1. Anthropometric and static performance measurements of the test dummies to establish information on their sizes and construction of im- portant body parts. 2. Sled testing to determine the sensitivity of test dummies to detect differences in the crash environments and their ability to provide consistent measurements of accelerations and motions of body segments occurring during impacts. 3. Sled and pendulum impact tests to estab- lish the repeatability of performance for those dummies which were found to render acceptable measurements during the preceding testing. The dummies tested included one sample each of VIP-3C and 492-03, and VIP-6C and 492-06, representing three and six year old children, re- spectively. The sled testing involved simulated 20 and 30 mph frontal and 20 mph side impacts, using production automobile seats and specially designed test seats. Two types of child seats, the G.M. "Love Seat" and the Chrysler Corpora- tions "Mopar" were selected as representative of the belt and padding restraint types in current use. For frontal impacts, to insure exposure to identical test conditions, dummies were tested in pairs, side by side, in identical child seats. placed at outboard seating positions. In side im- pacts, because of excessive sliding and rotation of child seats, only the center seating position was used. STATIC PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS Anthropometric measurements of the child test dummies were taken, using SAE J963 Recom- mended Practice as a guideline where possible. In general, these measurements were found to be compatible with the currently available values (1)*. For three year old size dummies, the results of the neck and spine force-bending characteristics are given in Figs. 1 and 2 as mean values of six tests, plotted within respective + 1 sigma bounds. Meaningful spine deflection data could not be ob- tained for the 492-03 dummy due to segmental construction of its spine. Similar data were not obtained with the six year old child dummies since their performance in dyhamic tests was found to require further improvements. DYNAMIC PERFORMANCE EVALUATION The dynamic performance evaluation of test dummies was accomplished in sled tests using the HYGE Crash Simulator which generated pulse shapes shown in Fig. 3. Two types of automobile seats were employed for this testing: The 1972 Chevrolet Impala front seat as representative of production- type, and a specially built, rigid seat which was used in 30 mph tests only. The rigid seat structure was built of 3/4 in plywood, mounted on a metal frame and padded with 1 inch of ensolite material. This seat was expected to simulate the most rigid *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper.</page><page sequence="6">PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF CHILD DUMMIES 3 1 93 40 JT, 35 ¿Á 30 Ó - A 25 O-O CO II to I _i Ir Q J s 20 sM y 1 1 &lt; / / // " 15 &lt;!-&lt;$ # 8/ J / / V / / / / 10 - // . / 5 o 0o 20° 40° 60° 80° DEFLECTION, DEGREES Fig. 1 - Neck bending characteristics 40 35 - 30 ¿ 25 ir- co / / '' / &lt; S ' O 20 tf-¿ / / O / / ī " / / " 15 p- fi A&gt;/ Y / io P f&gt; / / f / 5 / / o l ¡L 0° 10° 20° 30° 40° DEFLECTION, DEGREES Fig. 2 - Spine bending characteristics mounting platform possible, and also to reduce the variabilities existing in the stiffness of produc- tion seats and in positioning of child seats. Mounting of child seats on the bench seat re- quired the use of automobile lap belts which were installed in accordance with specifications for the Impala seat. The "Love Seat" also required an additional strap which went over the seat back and was attached to the sled floor. During the initial testing, it was determined that preloading of the attachment belts to 10-15 lb of tension was required to stabilize the child seats during impacts. The test dummies were dressed with cotton knit shirts, cotton muslin trousers and oxford- style gym shoes, boysT sizes 9 and 12, for three and six year old size child dummies, respectively. For all tests, dummiesT joints were adjusted to a nominal 1 G level. Test dummies were positioned in child seats in accordance with the manufacturers ł recommendations. Internal belts of the "Love Seat" were adjusted to one inch space between the dummy's chest and the straps. The "Mopar" seat, however, did not have such belts and dummies were tested unharnessed. INSTRUME NT AT ION Instrumentation of the test dummies, child seats, seat belts and test sled, and electronic data filtering were done in conformance with the provisions of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Stan- dard No. 208 and SAE J211a, Recommended Practice. The test sled was instrumented for the mea- surement of acceleration and velocity during each test. The dummies were instrumented for mea- surement of the head and chest accelerations. Targets were also placed on the head for deter- mining dummy's trajectory during impacts. The 492-03 and 492-06 dummies had to be modified for installation of chest accelerometers. Care was taken to install accelerometers on dummies of both manufacturers at as identical positions as possible. Measurement of the attachment belt loads was accomplished with Lebow strain- gauge transducers.

Head displacement trajectories were determined from analysis of the high-speed film with inclusion of appropriate photographic correc- tions. The data acquisition and reduction included recording of all analog data on magnetic tape which was then fed into a minicomputer for pro- cessing and printing of the test results. The com- puter printouts included the load and acceleration time histories, severity indices, and head injury criterion. TEST RESULTS The test configurations were designed to in- clude the needed variety of the restraint environ- ments and severity of exposures in which dummies* kinematic behavior and impact response could be adequately evaluated. Each test set consisted of three repeated tests designed to provide informa- tion on the consistency of the test measurements. The tests for three year old dummies included frontal and lateral crashes with Impala seats at 20 mph and frontal crashes with both types of seats at 30 mph. For the six year old child size dum- mies, testing was done only at 30 mph frontal im- pacts. The performance evaluation included examina- tion of time-dependent and time -independent mea- sures of the acceleration-time histories. This data was also examined for resonances and com- pared graphically as appropriate by superposition of responses from repeated tests and by statistical averaging of certain discrete values considered important in performance characterization of test dummies. The peak acceleration measurements occurring during the rebounds were not included in statistical computations since the seat back- rests were built to preclude deflections. Also, acceleration measurements which contained resonances were not evaluated. Performance Measurements of Three Year Old Child Dummies - Typical oscillograph records of the head and chest acceleration-time histories are shown in Fig. 4. For repeated tests, super- position of the computer reduced analogue resultant head and chest accelerations reveal similarity and coincidence of these traces for both dummies as indicated in Fig. 5. The shapes of the traces from repeated tests are found to be generally in good agreement except for shift in time by a few milli- seconds of the peak values, particularly those occurring during the later portion of the accelera- tion event or during the rebound phase. Tables 1 through 4 summarize the statistically derived performance measurements obtained in tests with the two dummies. These are expressed in terms of the means, standard deviations and co- efficients of variation. The included measurements are the head and chest peak accelerations occurring during the initial deceleration (forward motion) phase, maximum head C.G. deflection in Y and Z directions and belt loads where applicable. These results indicate that both dummies are reasonably sensitive to differences in the crash environments, whether this might involve differences in the types of impacts, acceleration levels or restraint con- figurations. Also, repeatability of response in the range of 2 to 8 percent variance is indicated for both dummies, particularly at higher acceleration levels. Differences exist, however, in the shapes and peak acceleration levels for two dummies, suggesting differences in their structure and kine- matics during impacts. Examination of high-speed photography obtained with equivalent size live pri- mates, tested in identical restraint systems by General Motors (2) and USAF-AMRL, showed the VIP-3C dummy* s flexions during impacts to re- semble closely those of primates.</page><page sequence="8">PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF CHILD DUMMIES 3195 HEAD ACCELERATION CHEST ACCELERATION G GL ~~ 70 - ~~ . j 8 1 1 I I I I I I I 1 1 1 I I 1 1 I 1 I » » » I I I 1 1 » I I ą 0 60 120 180 MS ç 0 60 120 180 MS ALDERSON VIP-3C ALDERSON VIP-3C G G 70 ļ- - 56 - 1 i i i i - i i i - i - i i i i i i i i i I i i i i i i_i i i i i i i i i i i d 0 60 120 180 MS _ 0 60 120 180 MS » D _ SIERRA 492-03 SIERRA 492-03 Figs. 5 A-D - Resultant acceleration overlays (3 tests).

The test- ing was performed on the Impala bench seats and on the ensolite padded rigid seat. The modifica- tions of the "Love Seat" included spreading apart the head restraining wings by externally mounted steel straps, cutting out two new slits in the plastic cradle to permit relocation of the shoulder belts in a higher position and reinforcement of anchorage of the attachment strap. Fig. 6 shows the head "X" axis accelerometer in the VIP-6C dummy resonating at approximately 225 HZ and all three accelerometer s of the 492-06 dummy at approximately 900 HZ. Hammer impacts on the forehead of seated dummies confirmed these findings. Fig. 7 shows a typical overlay of computer reduced head acceleration history. The data indi- cates a close coincidence of head acceleration traces in nonresonating portions of measured re- sponses and good repeatability of head excursion and chest acceleration measurements. It appears that, once the problem of the resonances are cor- rected, these two dummies might become useful devices also for acceleration measurements. REPEATABILITY TESTING Repeatability testing was performed only with three year old child dummies, since their perform- ance, obtained during the earlier testing, was judged to be acceptable. Because of resonance problems, the six year old child dummies were not evaluated. This part of the program included the sled tests, and pendulum impacts of dummy segments which are important in acceleration measurement. The primary measurements used in the assess- ment of repeatability were the shapes of the resul- tant head and chest acceleration-time histories and corresponding peak accelerations attained during the first impact (3, 4). Peak-belt loads were also added to provide another reference for comparison. This test series was performed with the "Love Seat" and "Mopar" child seats mounted on a special- ly built bench seat. This seat was a forerunner of the HSRI developed seat described in Part I and was constructed by mounting on the frame of the rigid seat used in earlier tests, a 6 in thick padding of Polyurethane foam on the seat and 4 inches on the backrest. The two dummies were tested, seated side by side, in identical child seats in six repeated sled tests, simulating 30 mph frontal impacts. Because only one sample of each dummy was tested, the test</page><page sequence="10">PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF CHILD DUMMIES 3197 VIP-6C ~ ^ IbSO HZ 492-06 I 1 A jlL hx2 ~ r~ī'i~' " HV2 -4- -j||^ ! , ' ' 1 : : • ' ■ . 1 Fig. 6 - Acceleration measurements. "Love Seat" on Impala seat 30 mph frontal impact results should not be considered all-inclusive, but rather indicative of what could be expected from tests with a larger population of both types of dummies. Sled Tests - The overlays of the head and chest resultant acceleration- time histories for both dummies are shown in Figs. 8 and 9. Good coinci- dence of the traces exists for both dummies, par- ticularly in tests with the "Love Seat. TT Comparison of the responses shown in Figs. 5 and 8 indicates differences between corresponding head and chest accelerations particularly noticeable in the head of the VIP-3C dummy with significantly larger second acceleration peak in the latter tests. Examination of high-speed photography revealed that, in the repeatability tests, the adjustment of child seat belts was looser, allowing the head of the VIP-3C dummy to impact the upper legs, which produced the high acceleration peaks. Table 5 gives statistically derived measure- ments of the repeatability of two dummies.

Pendulum Impact Tests - Pendulum impact is a simple and easily controlled dynamic test which could be used to verify the proper installation of accelerometers and to provide some insight into response characteristics of a tested object. The pendulum testing of three year old child dummies included head and chest impacts of a seated dummy and measurement of acceleration responses in six repeated tests for each type of impact. The tests were conducted by impacting the dummy's forehead and chest in the mid-saggital plane 2 and 10. 75 in below the top of the head, re- spectively. For chest impacts, the dummy's back was unrestrained. The impacts were made normal to the impacted surfaces by the flat face of a 10 lb</page><page sequence="11">3198 S. H. BACKA1TIS, ET AL.

Test dummies VIP-3C and VIP-6C can be instrumented for measurement of head and chest accelerations and head deflections during impacts. Test dummies 492-03 and 492-06 can also be in- strumented for measurement of head acceleration and deflections during impacts, however, they have to be modified for installation of chest accelero- meters. 2. In a series of three repeated frontal and side impact sled tests, the three year old child dummies were found to be capable of providing quantitative measurements of the severity of various child-automobile restraint crash environments pro- vided that objects external to the child seat were not impacted. The recorded head and chest acceleration time-histories are relatively smooth and devoid of resonance. 3. In sled tests at 30 mph, the three year old child dummies showed adequate repeatability of per- formance as measured by peak resultant head and chest accelerations. 4. The dynamic performance characteristics of the VIP-3C and 492-03 dummies are not suffi- ciently alike for these two dummies to be used inter- changeably. In sled tests, the 492-03 dummy ap- pears to be much stiffer and produces less head and upper torso flexion than the VIP-3C dummy. Com- parison of high-speed photography showed that the VIP-3C dummy performed kinematically much more like primates, and by inference would be a better simulator of children1 s motions, than the 492-03 dummy. 5. In the series of three repeated sled tests, consistent measurements of head deflections and chest accelerations were obtained with the VIP-6C and 492-06 dummies. However, for both dummies, the head acceleration data contained resonances rendering these measurements difficult to assess. 6. Since only one sample of each dummy type was tested and evaluated, the obtained results should be viewed as indicative of the performance potential of these dummies.</page><page sequence="13">3200 S. H. BACKAITIS, ET AL. 7. More consideration should be given to proper installation and attachment of child seats, in order to realize their full protective potential during crashes. Preloading of attachment belts in the range of 10-15 lbs. was found necessary to stabilize the child seats during the crash tests. REFERENCES 1. J. W. Young, J. T. McConville, H. M. Reynolds and R.

PART III COMPARISON OF KINEMATIC RESPONSE OF BABOONS AND CHILD DUMMIES Stanley H. Backaitis National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Department of Transportation John T. Shaffer and Robert M. Letscher, DVM USA F Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory Wright-Patterson Air Force Base PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objectives of this program were to de- termine: 1. Which of the two selected three year old size dummies simulate best the response of the child surrogates (baboons) in child restraint systems, and 2. What performance measure(s) are best suitable to describe the kinematic inter- action between the test subject and the restraint system. The comparisons were to be made in simulated forward and lateral collision modes. The primary concern with available dummies has been that they are to some extent crudely scaled down versions of adult size dummies. Proportion- ately, young children are considerably different from adults, and it is not known whether available three year old size dummies would provide good and useable data for child restraint design and evaluation. While the use of human subjects for impact tests has been made in the past, this has never included children. The closest available in-vivo surrogates for the three year old child which could be found at the USAF AMRL facility were juvenile baboons. These animals, while young, approximate the required physical size. They were selected as the standard for comparison with the two dummy types. The tests were conduc- ted using three different child seat constructions. This permitted the observation of the action of the dummies and animal subjects in more than one basic restraint concept. In addition to NHTSA's objectives, the Air Force and the AMRL were also interested in developing the following background information: Are baboons reasonable surrogates for humans in terms of their kinematic and patho- physiological responses to impact? How should dummies be designed and employed for impact testing? How are accelerations measured on dum- mies related to accelerations measured on animals and humans? TEST METHODOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT The method employed in these tests was a direct comparison of paired measurements obtain- ed in simulated crashes. A baboon and one of the dummies were tested side by side in identical child restraints, on a standardized simulated auto- mobile bench seat described in Part I. Use of this method, insured that both subjects received the identical impact profile and that comparison of kinematic excursion, acceleration and harness loading could be made directly. The program was not designed or intended to produce injury, beyond</page><page sequence="14">PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF CHILD DUMMIES 3201 Fig. 1 - CAMI dummy, three-year-old size minor abrasions and contusions, to animals. All impact tests were carried out on the AMRL Impulse Accelerator Facility, using a 24 in Bendix HYGE as the propulsion unit. Three types of commercially available child restraint seats were used: The Chrysler "Mopar," the GM "Love Seat," and the Peterson "Model 74." The child seats were mounted on the standardized bench seat as nearly in accordance with manufac- tured instructions as possible. The "Mopar" seat was the only one which did not contain an in- ternal harness. The "Love Seat" and the Peterson seats also utilized seat-holding straps. In the case of the "Love Seat", the strap goes over the back of the seat and is anchored to the floor of the sled. The Peterson restraint strap runs diagonally along the seat back and is anchored to the floor. All three seat types required an automotive type lap belt as part of the attachment to the bench seat. Two types of three year old child dummies were used for purposes of comparison: The Alderson VIP-3C, representing the more sophisti- cated mechanical design, and the CAMI dummy made by Civil Aeromedicai Institute of the Federal Aviation Administration and representing a simple semidistributed mass loading device with no inter- nal instrumentation capabilities. Figs. 1 and 2 depict the construction of the CAMI dummy weighing 34 lb with sitting height of 14 in to the shoulder and 22 1/2 in to the top of the head. The animals used in the test program were juvenile male baboons (Papio anubis). These ani- mals were only a fair match to some of the mea- surements of the dummies used. The average weight of the animals was 23 1/2 lb; about 10 lb lighter than would be desired. However, the sitting height averaged 22 in. At the end of the program, an animal weighing 31 lbs. was tested to see if Fig. 2 - Skeletal structure of the CAMI dummy there were any obvious kinematic differences due to weight. This animal was considerably larger, however, and actually too big for the child seat. His sitting height was 24 1/2 in. A total of five animals were used in the comparative testing pro- gram. Each animal was tested two to three times. INSTRUMENTATION Instrumentation used in these tests were to measure the impact-input environment, the accel- eration responses of the two dummies and baboons, and the loads in the child seat restraining hardware. Three independent measurements were made of the acceleration environment. A tach-generator was also used to give a continuous velocity record- ing. Instrumentation on the dummies and the ba- boons was considerably more complex with the basic requirement that it be as identical as possible to position and mounting on all subjects. External accelerometer mounting packages were developed to be compatible with both the dummies and the baboons so that a direct comparison of acceleration responses could be made. Internal instrumentation was used only on the VIP dummy for the purpose of comparing internal versus external transducer re- sponses. The external accelerometer mounting packages are shown in Fig. 3. The head accelerometer group consisted of three linear, orthogonally oriented accelerometers and an angular accelerometer oriented to measure x-z plane angular accelerations. The headband was used to mount the accelerometer group on the head. The chest acceleration packs consisted of only three orthogonally oriented accel- erometers. They were attached to a special mount- ing block and sewn to a velcro strap which was tightened around the chest of the dummies and ba- boons. On the dummies, the seemingly forward position of the head pack is dictated by the mounting requirements on the baboon. The baboon* s head is shaped so differently that use of the headband is not satisfactory. The best position for the head pack is at the top of the animal* s muzzle. This places</page><page sequence="15">3202 Fig. 3 - Two dummy types used: CAMI (left), VIP-3C (right) the head pack at nearly the same position relative to the skull in all three test subjects. The only additional instrumentation provided in the in-vivo test subjects was an ECG during baboon runs. Measurements of the child seat internal har- ness loads was found to be impractical without significantly disturbing the restraint method. Therefore, the load measurements were restricted to those belts which hold the child restraint to the bench seat. The belt anchorages included special swivels to maintain axial alignment with the strap at all times during the impact. Photographic instrumentation consisted of: 1. A quick look video system providing 10-12 pictures which permitted immediate replay and stop action viewing of a test, and 2. A four- camera high speed motion picture coverage arranged to allow tracking of trajectories of various targets on the subject. High speed color motion pictures were taken of each test, at 500 frames per second, with four orthogonally oriented cameras positioned one each in front, on the right and left sides, and above the test subjects. TEST PROCEDURES Tests were conducted in forward and lateral impact directions. The sled accelerations were performed at nominal impact velocities of 20, 25, and 30 mph in the forward direction, and 15 and 20 mph in the lateral direction. The waveforms for these tests are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The test matrix after a number of revisions co b I z o I- &lt; cc UJ -j UJ o o &lt; S. H. BACKAITIS, ET AL. was reduced to 35 test runs and 70 sets of data as shown in Table 1. Dummy preparation was reasonably simple for these tests. The CAMI dummy does not require limb adjustments. It was sometimes necessary to use low strength tape to maintain this dummy in an upright position. The joints of the VIP-3C dummy were adjusted to a nominal 1 G level. Baboon subjects were anesthetized with phencylidine hydrochloride at a rate of 1. 5 mg/1 kg of body weight and their body hair clipped to allow better visualization of body kinematics during the impact test. ECG leads were attached and the transmitter pack taped to the animal* s thigh. Be- cause of effects of anesthetics, it was sometimes necessary to use low strength tape to maintain the animal in the upright position similar to the method used in the CAMI dummy. The łłMoparłł seat con- figuration required that the chest pack be mounted on the back of the test subject to prevent injury to the animal. 30 - }/ y ' 30 MPH 20 " ff ' ' - 25 MPH fr ff / ' 20MPH ff / '' D0T Jf / BOUNDARIES 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 TIME - MS Fig. 4 - Sled acceleration profiles for forward collisions 30 - c n b 2 20 ^ Š ff ' - 20 MPH £ g ff ' ' ' '^/^15MPH ŪJ ff ' ' DOT O 10 - 1 ' BOUNDARIES L I i i i 1 1 V i ' I i i i 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 TIME - MS Fig. 5 - Sled acceleration profiles for lateral collisions</page><page sequence="16">PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF CHILD DUMMIES 3203 Table 1 - Test Run Summary TEST DIRECTION SPEED SEAT POSITION 1 POSITION 2 DATE REMARKS NO.

The baboons in the GM and Peterson seats required the use of a piece of tape to position the shoulder straps correctly. The baboonTs shoulders are nar- row and this tape, which broke at impact, assured that the animal loaded the harness and did not slip through. When the internal harness had been ad- justed, the lap belt straps and child seat holding straps, where appropriate, were each adjusted to a pretest tension of 10 to 15 lb at each tiedown. DATA REDUCTION Quick look data served the purpose of verifica- tion that all data was obtained for making decisions about the probability of injury to the animal at the next velocity level. The recorded analog data was digitized auto- matically and stored on paper tape maintaining a frequency fidelity of 100 Hz. The stored data was computer processed to determine accelerations, severity indices (SI), and head injury criteria (HIC). Reduction of high speed photographic data was computerized. Seven points were tracked on the motion picture film during digitization, which in- cluded sled position, hip point, knee, shoulder, elbow, head pack and top of the head. After digitization, the data was processed to determine the time-displacement histories of the points on test subjects relative to the sled. The data was also corrected for parallax errors. For the forward tests, the computer plots of the tra- jectories include the initial position of the bench seat, a stick figure representing the initial position of the subject and a stick figure representing the maximum displacement of the subject. However, for lateral tests plots for only the left seating position were made. It was discovered that a child seat in the left side position behaved quite differently from a seat in the right side, thus rendering any correlation of the test results diffi- cult. RESULTS A summary of the tests run during the pro- gram is given in Table 1. The test matrix does not include a 30 mph forward test with a baboon in the "Mopar" seat. This test was eliminated from</page><page sequence="17">3204 S. H. BACKAITIS, ET AL. the test program because the seat appeared to have a tendency to eject the subject from it on rebound and, because in 25 mph tests, the baboon's long snout had impacted the forward position of the seat impact surface, causing some hemorrhaging. The ejection problem was studied in two tests with dum- mies. The result was that both dummies remained in their seats during the 25 mph test while in the 30 mph test the CAMI dummy was ejected. In Tests 553, 554, and 555, the lap belt attachment points were moved from the instrumented swivels back to the bench seat to check for obvious restraint differences. Test 556 was conducted with a 31 lb. animal to investigate differences due to weight. DISCUSSION Side by side impact testing offers several ad- vantages for the comparative type testing done in this program: 1. It insures that both subjects re- ceive the identical impact acceleration profile, 2. The resulting data can be compared directly, 3. Visual comparisons of kinematics are much easier to make. However, there are also disadvan- tages which must be handled. The test setups must be as identical as possible. Much more instrumen- tation is required and, hence, more chances exist for setup, calibration and data reduction errors. Tables 2 through 5 summarize the results and other performance measures obtained during the testing.

The general trend of the data are increasing loads with increasing velocity. However, the data are poorly correlated with test velocity. Correla- tions are best with the "Mopar" seat. The baboon loadings are generally lower than those of the dum- mies. As the baboons were lighter in weight, this result could be expected. Review of the acceleration data in Table 6 leads to a reasonable conclusion that recorded accelera- tions on baboons in fore-and-aft collisions cannot be correlated with those measured on dummies be- cause of gross inadequacies in externally mounted instrumentation practices. No confidence levels can rationally be justified to such measurements even if the data on the basis of instrument readings appears to follow certain patterns in some instances. On the basis of current biomedical knowledge, it does not appear to be appropriate to make dummy- baboon comparisons and to evaluate restraint sys- tems in terms of severity indices or other criteria which amplify and modify the measured readings by a derived factor. Such factors have not been estab- lished so far for children and it is not reasonable to assume that adult values can be successfully scaled, unless such action is substantiated by experimental data. Acceleration data in Table 6 also shows that the internally mounted sensors in the VIP-3C dummy are the only ones to produce consistent data in all seat configurations and over the entire impact speed range.

The excur- sions of the top of the head were found to be largest in magnitude and from the safety standpoint, the head is the most critical for occupant survival. Analysis of data generated during the forward colli- sion, as typified by head excursions in Fig. 7, indi- cate the formation of certain patterns which lend themselves to further studies. Table 7 lists the fore-and-aft excursions ("X") of the top of the head of three test subjects. In general, dummies and primates, when tested in identical seats, exhibit reasonably similar excursion levels. Fig. 8 shows a typical plot of maximum head excursions over the impact speeds tested of all three test subjects in the "Love Seat." Fig. 9 provides, in a bar-chart form, a birds-eye view of head excursions of various test subjects in the three seat configurations. The "Love Seat" produces overall the lowest excursion levels, whereas the Peterson and the "Mopar" systems ap- pear to be at a generally higher plateau. Another approach for comparing the perform- ance of baboons and dummies is by the percent increase in excursions of each test subject between successively increasing impact levels as shown in Fig. 10. This plot can be used to study either the performance of a test subject in different seats or the effects of a seat on the performance response of various test subjects. The comparison indicates that the VIP-3C dummy in general provides a better match with primates than the CAMI dummy. Figure 11 compares dummies based on ba- boons head excursions at each impact level and in each seat configuration. The VIP-3C dummy ap- proximates better the excursion performance of the baboon in 11 out of 13 sets of tests than the CAMI dummy.

Fig. 10 - Percentage change of all test subjects head excursions relative to excursions at successively lower impact speeds of the VIP dummy was 14. 2 percent. In the two cases where the VIP dummy exceeded the CAMI excursions, the deviations were 18.4 in one case and 23. 8% in the other. Because of high complexity of interactions between test subjects and the restraint systems and seats, it is impossible within the test matrix to identify the individual elements that cause these deviations and to quantify their relative contributions. Table 7 lists also resultant displacements nRn at maximum forward excursions of the head which include the vertical vector. The resultant displace- ments are always larger but in general they follow the same patterns as those measured in the fore- and-aft directions. Runs #553, 554, and 555 with belt anchorages revised to match more precisely the vehicle geometry, did not result in appreciable changes in the test results. Run #556 which em- ployed a significantly heavier and taller baboon resulted in a rather close matching of peak accel- erations with the VIP-3C dummy. However, it exceeded the VIP-3C head excursions by more than 2 in to approximate the CAMI dummy ł s head dis- placement. The larger excursion may be explained by the 2. 1 in higher sitting height of this baboon. Two animals died approximately 24 h following the tests. Their deaths appeared to be due to failure to recover from anesthesia rather than impact trau- ma. Autopsy examination of one animal revealed no internal injuries. The second animal exhibited a mild small intestine and moderate urinary contu- sions. Test animals also typically displayed minor skin contusions and abrasions following the impact tests. Occasional minor lip or gum lacerations were noted with the MMoparn seat. +30 X////A GENERAL MOTORS I I PETERSON +20 - /: 1^11 CHRYSLER ; I i I LP 20 - jj S &lt; I O SS +20 - 1 ¿ + 10 - ¿ ^~L ; ; īy ^ ¿ m * T? - vip ¿ m * T? vip 20 - .30 1 1 1 20 25 30 MILES PER HOUR Fig. 1 1 - Percentage change in head excursions of dummies relative to primates "G" LEVELS AND HEAD EXCURSIONS IN LATERAL IMPACT TESTS The lateral impact tests were conducted in the three seat configurations using the same set of test subjects at 15 and 20 mph as in the forward collision mode.

In general, the measured data indicate that the VIP dummy approximates the re- sponse of primates closer than the CAMI dummy for all seat configurations, but its range of variance is still excessive when compared to primates. The acceleration response measured with internal accelerometers appears to be more consistent than that recorded with external sensors. Table 9 lists lateral "Y" and resultant "R" excursions of the top of the head of the three test subjects in the three restraint systems. Compari- son of the two dummies heads' excursions in the lateral mode with the "Love Seat" and the Peterson seat show a reasonably close match with those of primates. The "Mopar" seat, which has little pro- vision, if any, for lateral occupant retention and was not tested with primates, produces significantly higher dummy excursion levels compared to the ex- cursions in the other two seats. Test results, based on this limited set of data, suggest fairly good con- sistency in the ability of both types of dummies to simulate head excursion performance of primates. REBOUND LOADS AS A RESULT OF FORWARD COLLISION AND REBOUND EJECTION The rebound response in child restraint sys- tems is significantly more complex for analysis than the first impact in the forward-collision or the lateral-collision modes. The basis for judgment can be either the "G" level, if it is within the con- fines of the child restraint system, or the "G" level and excursion-ejection, if it is out of the bounds of the child restraint. The "G" level of a test subject which is out of bounds of the child re- straint system is not a reliable measure since the magnitude of the head response will depend to a great degree on what the head hits and at what time the hit occurs. During dummy tests at the 20 mph impact, no tendencies for ejection of the dummies were noticed, except for some indication that the CAMI dummy in the Chrysler seat is experiencing significantly larger rebound excursions than the other two test subjects. To avoid the possibility of complete ejection from the "Mopar" seat, the CAMI dummy's and the baboon's legs were tethered to limit the test subjects' rebound motions to only a partial ejection. In supplementary tests, complete ejection of the CAMI dummy was confirmed in Run #551. In view of the leg restraints, the rebound "G" levels mea- sured on test subjects in the "Mopar" seat have little, if any, meaning. Test results, based on limited confidence "G" levels listed in Table 10 indicate that, as a whole, the rebound "G" levels are lower than the "G" levels measured during the first forward collision. There is also no perceptible "G" level pattern that might indicate some cluster- ing tendency with respect to impact speed levels. No analysis was performed relative to excursion kinematics of the test subjects in the rebound mode. The analysis of rebound is extremely complicated from photographic accuracy and data reduction point of view. It was felt that the reduced excursion data is error prone and could not stand the tests of credibility and reliability.

Since biomechanical data on children is nearly non- existent, and there are not even good prospects to gather such data, the researcher is forced to use methods of simulation and approximation, which in his judgment would lead to the attainment of said objectives. It is realized that the selection of baboons for testing purposes can be questioned relative to their anatomical suitability. The selection within the available baboon population was based primarily on matching the size and secondarily on matching mass. Baboon C-60 used in Test 556 was of match- ing mass, but its size during seating caused jam- ming of the test subject into the seat, which cer- tainly cannot provide for an appropriate interaction with the respective restraint system. The use of lower mass baboons than the intended mass may also be further justified by the fact that on the basis of child seat utilization, the usage begins to drop off significantly as soon as the child is capable of getting out of the seat. Thus, maximum child seat utilization occurs in the 9-month to 2 1/2-year old age bracket. It is also realized that, relative to the kinematic response, the excursions of the heavier children would be somewhat greater than those of lighter weight primates in those restraint systems which rely on webbing to perform the re- straining function. Review of the head excursion data indicates that with a few exceptions generally the dummies have slightly larger head excursions than primates. Precise determination of the dif- ference and its correlation with appropriate in-vivo test subjects could be the subject of another study. CONCLUSIONS 1. Test results indicate that the more sophisticated mechanical VIP dummy consisting of clearly defined and adjustable body segments is a better and more consistent simulator of the in-vivo response (of baboons and not necessarily of children) than the semi-lumped mass CAMI dummy. 2. Test results indicate that current levels of instrumentation technology and its application to in-vivo subjects are inadequately developed and standardized to permit consistent measurements of "G" level exposure and the comparison of these measures with those recorded by the dummies. 3. Because of relatively significant disper- sion of MGM level data, obtained on live subjects with external instrumentation, it is impossible to establish correlation factors based on dynamic re- sponse between baboons and dummies. 4. The VIP dummy appears to correlate fairly well with baboons on the basis of head excur- sions in the forward- and lateral-collision modes. The correlation is based on trends and not neces- sarily on absolute values. No correlation was found for head excursions in the rebound phase of the for- ward impact mode. 5. The forward excursion measure appears to be valid for the performance of child dummies, and harness type and shield type child restraint systems, although more consistency is evident with integrated harness seats. 6. The monocoque shield type restraint sys- tem with no lateral retention provisions exposes the test occupant under certain conditions to rebound ejections during the forward-collision mode, and to a significantly larger lateral excursion, than that experienced in harness type restraints, in the lateral impact mode. 7. The excursions of child dummies in the forward-collision mode are in general slightly larger than those experienced by the primates. The primates in the TTMoparM seat, however, ap- pear to have larger excursions than the dummies. In the lateral-impact mode, the primates appear to have slightly larger excursions than their dummy counterparts. 8. It is realized that, in spite of rather large amounts of testing done, only minimal data has been generated to establish performance trends, and not necessarily absolute values. 9. The baboons do not necessarily provide the best test subjects for the evaluation of child re- straint systems or for comparing the adequacy of dummies to simulate children. But, in the absence of any prospects to test children and/or child cada- vers at even moderate levels of crash exposure, this baboon test program has produced the first significant set of data which will help to understand the kinematics of in-vivo test subjects in child re- straint systems. 10. To provide more complete understanding of the child kinematics and to establish levels of in- jury tolerance, it will be necessary at some future time to perform a selection-trade-off-availability study as to what is the most optimum child surrogate for these purposes and what alternatives may be used.
