CLEISTHENES THE LEUSTER Herodotus (5.67-8) tells that Cleisthenes undertook a number of measures to rid Sicyon of Argive influence; it appears the city had been brought under Argive control in the course of Argos' imperialist venture to recover the 'heritage of Temenos '. One of these measures was the attempted expulsion from Sicyon (Kg3aAEfi v K 7ijT Xi xprp) of the Argive hero Adrastus, whose heroon stood in the agora (the manipulation of heroes' bodies was a common theme in archaic political propaganda).2 Delphi however would not sanction the expulsion of Adrastus, and told Cleisthenes that Adrastus was king of the Sicyonians, but that he, Cleisthenes, was a leuster: "Aprla-quTov tzEv EtVaLt ZAK vCvtOv fLautAE, EKEIVOV S EAEvUT?pa.3 Although the basic meaning of the uncommon word AEvca-rp is not in doubt, its significance in context has been misunderstood. Hesychius glosses it Oov&amp;a ALotsr dvatpoi)vra, 'a murderer who slays with stones', and this makes good etymological sense (root of AE,-wo + productive agent suffix).4 Some of the other few attested uses of the word are compatible with this meaning: 1.

Death by stoning is clearly ignoble, a fit punishment for adultery. The hypothetical stoning would be carried out by plural stoners. 2.

Here the word is evidently used to mean more generally something like 'oppressor' (as LSJ), and has a negative connotation. A lumeon is a 'destroyer' or 'corrupter.' However, there is also one use of the term that is manifestly passive, to mean 'one who is (fit to be) stoned', and two adjectival uses that are probably passive: 4. Suda s.v.

Here leuster is used as an adjective, and the phrase must mean in context 'death by being stoned'. The adjective therefore probably has a passive significance; I concede that it is just possible that the adjective should in itself have an active significance, even though the phrase as a whole must have a significance that is tantamount to passive, i.e. 'death that comes from a stoner'. 6. Lycophron 1187: AEvaTjpa rpir-ov ...~ iLasr 7 rpov. An active or a passive significance could underpin this transferred usage: is the stone associated with its thrower or its target? The use of a word with a distinctive agent-suffix and clearly attested active usages in a passive significance is curious but undeniable. The transition from active to passive can be made in this case, I shall argue later, because of a strange association between 'stoner' and 'stoned'. In sharing active and passive significance, the word is similar to that with which Suda associates it, rraAattvatog, which means both 'one defiled by blood-guiltiness' (e.g. Aeschylus Eumenides 448; Sophocles Electra 587; Hyperides F85 Jensen) and 'avenger of blood' (e.g. Xenophon Cyropaedia 8.7.18); the usage at Euripides IT 1218 seems to fall between the two meanings.5 'SKIRMISHER' Attempts to explain the oracle given to Cleisthenes have all focused on the active significance of leuster, and usually supposed that a 'stone-thrower' was the lowest and most contemptible rank in an archaic army, the role of a man who could not afford his 57rAa, a mere 'skirmisher '.6 This 'skirmisher' explanation is unsatisfactory for three reasons: 1. Of the attested usages of leuster (cited above), none is in a military context. The usual Greek words for a soldier that threw stones from the hand were At0ofdAosr and 7TErpoJdoAos, and for a slinger, aUEv8ov)TS-q.7 The presumption must therefore be that leuster is not a military word. 2. There is only weak evidence that military slingers and stone-throwers were of low status in the archaic and classical periods. This therefore makes the oracle's rebuke to Cleisthenes seem rather pale. In his discussion of the low status of stone-throwers, Pritchett quotes for the archaic period only the passage under discussion,8 though he elsewhere describes the reference to slingers at Archilochus F3 West as 'scornful', following Burnett:9 Ito, "dAA ' '7r' Tdea Tav "aa  'aS, o "gOatzta' aUqvdvat8 Eva, E'V u8' zOAov "Ap~ u vvdy,-it Ev LALOt. tUOEUWV Sl roAv'TovoV EUovv ETat EpyOV ...

This is insufficient to warrant the use of' stone-thrower' purely as a derogatory concept by the oracle. Furthermore it is a difficulty that such scorn as there is is generalised against all light arms and not stone-throwers in particular; a0EEv8dvaL are mentioned second after dea, and it seems that it was rather to bows in particular that scorn for light arms attached in the archaic period.'x This Archilochean passage is often associated with Strabo's report of an Eretrian stele banning the use of long-range weapons in the Lelantine war (iU XpaOeat TOrAE"Aotsr), where Strabo interprets -rAEld"Aots~ to include slingers."i There is little agreement on the genuineness and significance of this stele, but there is certainly no need to read any disparagement of stone-throwing in it."2 It is worth noting that in the Iliad heroes often pick up and lob stones at each other without any implied diminution of status (e.g. 11.265).13 For the disparagement of slingers in the classical period Pritchett quotes two passages, Demosthenes 23.148 and Xenophon Cyr. 7.4.15. Yet the point of Demosthenes' objection to Charidemus here is not that he was a slinger and a tLAds, but that he fought against Athens in this station; indeed, to read the reference to slinging as disparaging is actually to weaken the force of Demosthenes' point. Only Xenophon's Cyrus is outrightly abusive of the sling (' rAov 8ovAULKCTaTov'). Even so, the reason given for the sling's servility is a rather specific and rational one: slingers cannot be self-sufficient in battle (even so Cyrus concedes 'IcXvp&gt; dJ cbEAotaLt UEV8OV7)Tct'). The only iconographical evidence I know for a military stone-thrower is an archaic Spartan pithos fragment from the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia.14 He wears a helmet, a sword in a scabbard at his belt, and a leopard-skin loin-cloth. He holds up a large stone in his left hand, and was presumably throwing another from his lost raised right hand. He strides a pace behind a partially preserved archer who holds his bow aloft, and likewise has a sword at his belt. Between the feet of the two soldiers lies the corpse of one of their dead opponents. If the image ascribes any moral value to the stone- thrower (or his fellow archer), it must be a high one: he and the archer are fine and proud figures.15 I suspect that a chief reason the 'skirmisher' interpretation of leuster has been so popular is that it fits neatly into the old 'hoplite hypothesis' of tyranny:'6 as Cleisthenes as tyrant ought to have ridden on the crest of the hoplite wave, so it would have been particularly galling to him to be abused as the very antithesis of a hoplite. 3. If leuster meant only 'mere skirmisher', the meaning of the oracle as a whole was 10 Thus Homer, 11. 11.385 (of Paris); cf. Aeschylus, Persians 147; Sophocles, Ajax 1120; Euripides, Heracles 160-2, with G. Bond, Euripides Heracles (Oxford 1981), at line 161. 11 C448. 12 Cf. Pritchett op. cit.

Greenhalgh, Early Greek Warfare (London, 1973), 180 n. 30, who misinterprets the figure in front of the stone-thrower (' slinger') as a hoplite (and argues that the stone-thrower is thus shown in the second rank behind the hoplite) and therefore takes the image as evidence for the diminished status of the stone-thrower; but the remains of the bow are clear. Only his short sword connects him with a hoplite, yet our stone-thrower has a sword of the very same model. 16 A. Andrewes, The Greek Tyrants (London, 1956) is the classic statement of the hypothesis.</page><page sequence="4">356 D. OGDEN extraordinarily banal, and not at all enigmatic (though the current obscurity of leuster may render it so to us). Delphic oracles should ideally bear easily two diametrically opposed interpretations (even if one interpretation - usually the false - is more immediately obvious than the other): e.g. 'TreXos TPLToyEVELd VALVOV SLSOL Eop~ora ZEPb/ltzoL-vov d7rdpOrlTov TEAEOELV, To iE rTKVa 7' dIEL' (Hdt. 7.141), and 'qv arparELl7-ratL Tl HFIpaas, Ey ydArv &amp;py~v tLL Ka'raTa ELV' (Hdt. 1.53). The proponents of the 'skirmisher' interpretation do not offer a second, contradictory reading to complement the one they find immediately apparent. PHARMAKEIA I therefore offer an alternative explanation, one which exploits both the active and passive significances of leuster, and so renders the oracle properly ambiguous: the casting of stones is characteristic of the driving out of the scapegoat, pharmakos, and it is to this ritual that the oracle refers."7 Cleisthenes is compared, in his expulsion of Adrastus, to a man driving out the polluted pharmakos; but he is also abused by the oracle as himself a pharmakos. Thus the oracle means both 'Adrastus was king, and/but you are expelling him as if he were a lowly pharmakos' and 'Adrastus was king, but you are a lowly pharmakos.' ADRASTUS AS PHARMAKOS Stoning was the usual method of expulsion for a pharmakos.81 At Abdera the scapegoat was driven outside the city walls with stones (Burkert conjectures that this also happened at Athens);"9 at Massilia the scapegoat was stoned to death;20 at Ephesus Apollonius of Tyana presided over the stoning to death of a beggar, to purify the city of plague.21 The mythical eponym Pharmakos himself was stoned to death by Achilles' men for temple robbery.22 Hipponax, from whose fragments 5-11 West (and Tzetzes' lines upon them) we gain our fullest knowledge of the pharmakos, wishes of his opponent: rcognws 0r8L (KaKOS&gt; KaKOV OL'TOV dhAEi7aL/fl0ovAt 8rltLOLrLtL 7rapTLL O'v &amp;dhA6s 7pvyroto (128 West),23 and his opponent EEKEUE dAAhELV KLa' hEELV 'I7rr7rWvaKTa (37 West).24 (The scapegoat was also often beaten on the genitals with rods from different kinds of marginal plants such as squills and fig-branches.25 This beating probably normally preceded the expulsion with stones. But at Chaeronea a slave, personifying hunger, gfloAhtpos, was actually chased out with rods of the willow- 17 For the ritual of pharmakeia, and its many and varied representations and developments in mythical and historical narrative, see primarily: J.

The word that Herodotus twice uses of Adrastus' expulsion is ekballein, a word that seems very appropriate to the chasing out of a scapegoat (particularly an inanimate one).27 It is perhaps not surprising that Adrastus was such an unaccommodating pharmakos: his name consists simply of the adjective 6Spaa-osr, 'not inclined to run away' (the word is used in just this sense by Herodotus at 4.142).28 The quotation of the name by the oracle lends more wit to its message: 'You're trying to chase Adrastus away, but he won't go!' CLEISTHENES AS PHARMAKOS To call Cleisthenes a leuster in the passive sense, that of pharmakos, was intensely abusive: individuals driven out as pharmakoi in attested rituals (as opposed to representations in myth, which will be discussed below) were all that was vile and disgusting.

Most obviously, Coes of Mytilene was taken out and stoned to death at the start of the Ionian revolt (Hdt. 5.38, i'ayaydVTESr KaTEv',aav).38 Pittacus, tyrant of Lesbos, is abused by Alcaeus as fit to be stoned, Aa3oALot' (F298 V 1.3);39 in the same poem Alcaeus reminds the Mytileneans that the Greeks were drowned because they forebore to stone Ajax (for his outrage to Cassandra).40 BASILEUS-PHARMAKOS Whereas in attested rituals it is the lowly that are expelled, in mythical pharmakeiai it is usually the king. But in both cases a link with the opposite status can be made: for according to myth Codrus was expelled dressed as a slave,4' whereas at Massilia 26 Plut.

OGDEN the lowly real-life scapegoat was fed like a king for a year before his expulsion.42 It is agreed that kings and the assorted lowly individuals actually attested as pharmakoi have in common an exteriority or marginality to society, with the king being the 'lonely marginal at the top'.43 The original direct form of the oracle probably used basileus and leuster both in the nominative (e.g. autAEk 1 "A8pau-os-  rroAd'ws, AEVU-'1Sp 8i v').44 The oracle will thus have acknowledged the association between king and scapegoat by jingling with the syllable AEVa-.45 Indeed both Adrastus and Cleisthenes appear to embody both basileus and pharmakos. It is significant that Adrastus should be given the title basileus here where he is being expelled as pharmakos. But the association is almost certainly made in the case of Cleisthenes too. It is probable that the Orthagorids knew themselves as basileis rather than tyrannoi, and that one of the oracle's functions is to deny implicitly to Cleisthenes the title to which he aspires: 'You are a pharmakos, not a basileus, like Adrastus. '46 THE IDENTITY BETWEEN EXPELLER AND EXPELLED The oracle therefore highlights the paradoxical identity between expeller and expelled, both by its equivocation in leuster and its representation of Adrastus and Cleisthenes as each both basileus and pharmakos. This curious identity can be well paralleled from a particular development of the pharmakeia-complex: the abuser. The most renowned 'abuser' in Greek literature is Thersites (1. 2.211-393). Physically, he is the ideal scapegoat: 'the most disgusting man to go to Troy, stammering, lame, hunchbacked, pointy-headed and virtually bald' (216-19). His punishment by Odysseus, a blow with a rod (his sceptre, 265) is one entirely appropriate to a scapegoat. Furthermore, Odysseus envisages his expulsion proper: &amp;qj ow/ 1rErA177yc9 dyop?Olev JELKE'UL 77rAqyLULv (263-4). He specifies that he will first expose his genitals (261) - perhaps for something akin to a squill-beating, like the Colophonian pharmakos? (Perhaps too it is significant that the abuse Thersites gives here is largely of a sexual kind; Thersites is also attributed with sexual obloquy at Aithiopis Fl, where he is killed by Achilles for abusing his love for Penthesilea). Thersites delights in making the people laugh at those he ridiculed (215), but ends up by drawing the laughter of the community onto himself (270), a laughter which fulfils the same integrative function as communal stoning. Thersites is himself the embodiment of his abuse, and himself deserves to be abused; indeed, according to Schol. Il. 2.212-16b, Homer was the first to write silloi, lampoons (the word also means 'squint-eyed'), and in them Homer abused Thersites, and Thersites the 42 Lactantius ad Statius Theb. 10.793: anno tot publicis sumptibus alebatur purioribus cibis.

He is probably the subject depicted by the anthropomorphic ape on the handle of the Caeretan hydria Louvre E696; Plaoutine notes that the figure is lame, pointy-headed and baldish.'5 The Greeks thought of apes as ugly,58 stupid,59 ridiculous,60 and also as (uncomplementary) mimics,61 and so the animal constituted a very suitable model for Thersites.62 Two Aesopic fables in particular present apes in scapegoat-like aspect.

We may compare also the dwarf Cercopes, who laughed at Heracles' blackened bottom (sexual mockery again), and who were transformed appropriately into either stones or apes.63 We shall return to apes. Aesop too was a pharmakos, stoned to death by the Delphians for the crime of the eponymous Pharmakos, theft of a phiale from a temple.64 He was also chased over a crag, like Thersites and the Leucadian scapegoat.65 The descriptions of his deformity and general scapegoat-like marginality in the Vitae are remarkable: a Phrygian slave, bad-looking, exceedingly decrepit, pot-bellied, pointy-headed, snub- nosed, bad at Greek, stammering and booming-voiced, swarthy, stunted, lame, weasel-armed, pole-necked, hunchbacked, crooked, a portentous error.66 Nagy notes that his execution followed his claim that the Delphians were slaves and his telling of a tale that compared them to driftwood, and that his abuse was characterised as ridicule.67 Two rather amusing archaic pots illustrate stone-throwers in a non-military context, and the subjects of both seem well qualified to be pharmakoi. The first is the Protoattic crater CVA Berlin A32 (plates 18-21), by the so-called 'Oresteia painter' (he draws his name from an insecure interpretation of the vase in question). Under one of the handles is a grotesque, squat, bald but hairy little man, with chubby (though not necessarily deformed) limbs; he is turning round to throw stones at three more dignified, statuesque figures (2 male, one female), behind him. He has one stone raised ready to throw, and a second waiting in his other hand. Under the opposite handle two similarly bald, bearded but otherwise smooth men throw stones, apparently at each other. The three stone-throwers are all black, whereas the other characters have white skins. The little man owes something to the ape, and one wonders whether he is some relation of Thersites.68 The second vase is a Corinthian olpe, Villa Giulia 46781, the illustration of which has been brilliantly explained by Seeberg as an episode from the myth of Astrabacus 63 Ptolemy Claudius 5.2; Hdt. 7.216; Suda s.v.

The death of Aesop brings us close to the career of Cleisthenes, for according to the Vitae it was Aesop's reproach and subsequent death that was the cause of the First Sacred War, a war which in factCleisthenes orchestrated to gain control of the Delphic oracle. Griffin op. cit. (n. 1) 53; Forrest op. cit. (n. 6). The more historical Sotades, 'kinaidologos', like Thersites an exponent of sexual obloquy and scourge of kings in particular (most notably he abused Ptolemy Philadelphus' mistress Bilistiche, and his incestuous marriage to his sister Arsinoe II), similarly met a scapegoat's fate when dumped in the sea in a leaden vessel by Ptolemy's admiral Patroclus: EL ttoAvfPiv KEpatud3a tiflaAhcv Ka'L dvayaycov Ers N rrAayos KaTE7OrrdvTw (Athen. 620f-621a; cf. P. M. Fraser, Ptolemaic Alexandria [Oxford 1972], I 117-18, II 210 nn. 204-6). This recalls the fate of the Leucadian scapegoat (Strabo C452), and also demonstrates the similarity between pharmakeia and ekthesis (see below for ekthesis by sea). Archilochus' sexual mockery has also been seen as verbal pharmakeia (Burnett op. cit. [n. 9] 87 on F154 West; Nagy op. cit. [n. 47] 243-52); it is therefore appropriate that he portrays himself as the son of a slave-woman Enipo, 'Abuse' (F295 West). 68 For discussion of this pot, and possible interpretations of these figures (early comic figures? protosatyrs?), see S.

The two to the rear have legs and feet badly twisted inwards. The first hunter has sound legs, but a grossly distended arm, which reaches to the floor, though he walks upright; with his other, normal arm he hurls a stone at the hare. Behind the party gambols, as if a suitable companion, a crazy ape, its legs even more deformed and inwardly twisted than those of the hunters. Here again then is a stone-thrower, who himself, together with his companions, seems as well qualified to receive as to give pharmakeia. FURTHER ASPECTS OF THE PHARMAKEIA OF ADRASTUS 1. Cleisthenes and pollution The expulsion of the pharmakoi normally freed the community from the pollution that caused ALidS and AoLposg. Herodotus makes no actual mention of such pollution at Sicyon in the context of the proposed expulsion of Adrastus; this need not be significant, for Cleisthenes may have considered himself primarily to be freeing the Sicyonian community of the metaphorical pollution of Argiveness. But there is circumstantial evidence that Cleisthenes may have been represented as arguing, that Adrastus was in some way genuinely polluted, for Cleisthenes was explicitly attributed with eagerness to expel the polluted in the episode of his accession. Nicolaus of Damascus (FGH 90 F61), drawing, probably, on Ephorus, tells that Cleisthenes worked his way to the throne by persuading his second eldest brother Isodamos to murder their eldest Myron, and then chasing the former from the throne and the city on the ground that he was polluted by the murder of Myron and therefore unfit to perform the sacrifices integral to kingship. 2. Adrastus as polluting corpse Cleisthenes could have argued that Adrastus was polluting simply as a corpse. Herodotus tells that the tyrant Pisistratus purified the island of Delos by digging up all the dead buried within sight of the temple and took them to another part of the island.o0 Unlike Cleisthenes' attempted purification, Pisistratus' was undertaken at the behest of Delphi. In 426, as a result of the plague, the Athenians continued the process begun by Pisistratus and removed altogether all the corpses from the island.7" It was ironic that Cleisthenes should attempt to dig up the bones of Adrastus of all men, for Adrastus was renowned for himself championing the burial of the dead. He fled to Athens and begged for help in burying the fallen members of the Seven against Thebes: /i 7TErpLopdV...d -rdqov- LyVOzLEvov~ (Isoc. Paneg. 55); aUaov VEKpOVs tLOL ... o VEKpOVb 6dOWOULV (Euripides Suppl. 168, 174). 3. The chest of Adrastus Adrastus may be associated with pharmakeia in another context. Ampelius (Lib. Mem. 8.5) tells of a chest of Adrastus that was on display at the temple of Apollo in Sicyon: Sicyone in Achaia in foro aedis Apollinis est.: in ea sunt posita ... Adrasti arca, quam deposuit, in qua quid sit ignoratur.72 This chest may well have been one in which Adrastus was supposed to have been exposed as a baby. The larnax was a significant symbol of exposure, as is indicated by Hesychius' gloss of 'K a'dpvaKos by vdOog, and by the many myths in which unwanted children are abandoned in them (often at 69 Op. cit. (n. 62). 7o 1.64; Thuc. 3.104. 71 Thuc. 1.8, 3.104, with N. S. R. Hornblower, A commentary on Thucydides (2 vols, Oxford, 1991- ) ad loc.; Diod. 12.58.6. 72 Griffin op. cit. (n. 1) 17.</page><page sequence="10">362 D. OGDEN sea, together with their mothers, for whom the experience is rather an 'ordeal of chastity').73 Adrastus' chest may have been akin to the 'larnax of Cypselus' that Pausanias saw displayed at Olympia - the chest in which one tradition held that baby Cypselus had been concealed.74 Cypselus' concealment has rightly been seen as a sort of exposure." The cherished 'ignorance' of the contents of Adrastus' chest also suggests that it was an exposure vessel: the supposedly 'unknown' contents of the kistai carried by the little girls in the Athenian Arrhephoria are persuasively argued by Robertson and Brule to have been believed to be the exposed child Erichthonius.76 The existence then of a 'chest of Adrastus' implies the existence also of the myth of his exposure as a child. Exposure, at any rate in myth, is closely identified with pharmakeia (Oedipus is the obvious example of the identification: an exposed child who returns home bringing back his pollution, and then has to be expelled a second time as pharmakos).77 Thus it is likely that Adrastus was a 'scapegoatable' figure at Sicyon, and this affords suitable context to Cleisthenes' action, and Delphi's response to it. 4. Adrastus in the Thebaid Possibly Adrastus exhibited aspects of the pharmakos in the Thebaid. Paus 8.25.8 tells that in the Thebaid "ASpaUros i EOEvyEv K O3l bv E'Zfa-ra Avyp&amp; E'pwv. He thus seems to resemble Codrus in his flight from Athens as a scapegoat, dressed as a slave.78 5. A second Herodotean Adrastus Herodotus employs another, apparently unrelated character called Adrastus, a Phrygian, son of Gordias, son of Midas, in his tale of Croesus and Atys (1.34-45), but like Herodotus' Argive Adrastus, the Phrygian one is polluted and expelled: he is 73 E.g. Danae and Perseus (Pherecydes FGH 3 FIO); Auge and Telephus (Apollod. Bibl. 2.7.4, 3.9.1; P.Mediol. 1, apud E. W. Handley and J.

Robertson, 'The Riddle of the Arrhephoria at Athens', HSCP 87 (1983), 241-78 explains that the myth in which the daughters of Cecrops were entrusted with a basket containing the earthborn infant Erichthonius and two guardian snakes (Apollod. 3.14.6; Callimachus Hecale F70 Hollis, etc.) was an aition for the Arrhephoria; cf. Brule op. cit. (n. 73) 124-39. The secrecy of the contents of the kistai gave rise to a folk etymology of the name Arrhephoria: errTEL8 ra dpprpra l v Kla-rat EcEp 77p L ovEr L  al pOE'VOL (Schol.

Mockery We have seen the association between ridicule and pharmakeia in the cases of Thersites, Aesop and Archilochus: Herodotus says of Cleisthenes that he TrrA~Irov KaTEyEhAaE  TLV LKVUVt'wv in a measure associated with the attempted expulsion of Adrastus, the renaming of the Sicyonian tribes after pigs and asses.80 7. Apollo It is particularly appropriate for the god of Delphi, Apollo, to make accusations of pharmakeia, for it is at his festival, the Thargelia, that pharmakoi are expelled (and it is Apollo indeed that sends loimos, as in the Iliad ad init.). Istros explained the fate of the eponymous Pharmakos in his 'Epiphanies of Apollo', which suggests that Apollo had a hand in his fate."' In the stoning of Aesop as a pharmakos Apollo is actually said to have taken part himself ('Ado'AAwOvos avvEpyol6vo7).82 Thus the theme of pharmakeia can be traced elsewhere in the legend of Cleisthenes and the myth of Adrastus, and this fact lends further support to the theory that it is pharmakeia that is the subject of Herodotus' oracle.
