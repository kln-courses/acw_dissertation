<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bloomsbury's Beasts: The Presence of Animals in the Texts and Lives of Bloomsbury WENDY B. FARIS Universitv of Texas at Arlington Animals do not play a major role in Virginia Woolf's experimental masterpieces, articulated under the sign of the androgynous mind rather than of the hetero sexual beast, but they are present in minor if significant ways. They signal a number of covert presences, figuring the emotional, the mystical, and perhaps even the social underside of Bloomsbury's dominant intellectual and aesthetic pursuits. Thus Bloomsbury's beasts may remind us of the 'instinctual drive and continuous relation to the mother' thatJulia Kristeva maintains is the cost when 'language as symbolic function' constitutes itself, revealing an often concealed side of Bloomsbury that looked towards the traditional English past, spirituality, and Romanticism, rather than forwards to the innovations of international secular modernism.I According to Samuel Rosenbaum, Bloomsbury's writing combines two broadly different clusters of value, one of which is usually sacrificed to the other in much modern literature. [. . .] One [. . .] rational [:] [. . .] a profound belief in truth, analysis, pluralism, toleration, criticism, individualism, egalitarianism, and secularism. The other cluster [.. .] is harder to label, but it has to do with the visionary[:] [ ...] an equally profound faith in intuition, imagination, synthesis, ideality, love, art, beauty, mysticism, and reverence.2 Bloomsbury's beasts belong largely to the second register. As I have been suggesting, then, animals in the texts and lives of Bloomsbury serve three main functions. First, they embody repressed individual emotions or unresolved social issues; secondly, they represent reverent feelings of connection with the cosmos. Given Bloomsbury's bias, the presence of animals often implies a criticism of social rules, but unlike earlier treatments of animal communities as utopias or dystopias, such as Swift's herd of houyhnhms, for example, in keeping with the value Bloomsbury invested in individuals, Bloomsbury's beasts are often seen alone. This solitude also contributes to their efficacy as cosmic connectors. Furthermore, that animals serve both as outlets for repressed emotions and vehicles to express cosmic relatedness means that they also serve a third function: they help construct the delicate web of communal feelings and 1 Julia Kristeva, Desire in Language: A Semiotic Approach to Literature and Art, ed. by Leon S.

In fulfilling these general functions, the presence of animals in Bloomsbury's texts fits into several related categories. As I have suggested, animals often serve to express partially repressed or problematic emotions or desires. This is not to deny that, as Reginald Abbott points out, Woolf absorbed the Victorian ideology of 'an ordered animal world governed by man' as articulated in Thomas Berwick's widely read A General History of Quadrupeds.3 But the presence of animals in her work, while not greatly deviating from this view, nevertheless moves slightly beyond this ordered norm in the direction of the unruly; she implicitly approves, for example, of her family dog's habit of running wildly through the streets of the town.4 Similarly, Woolf's acknowledgment that her article on 'The Plumage Bill' was 'an outburst of sex antagonism', contrasting with her own denigration of such verbal outbursts in A Room of One's Own, suggests that the subject of animals often freed her from habitual restraints.5 Thus this presence of animals in Bloomsbury seems to be a small and unruly current running in the opposite direction from the mainstream Victorian vision of animals in the zoo, described by Harriet Ritvo as emblematic of the British imperial system.6 Such a current flows to and from the unconscious, contribut ing a non-human element to Virginia Woolf's streams of consciousness. In a characteristically meticulous footnote to an uncharacteristically proud moment in Beginning Again, the third part of his autobiography, Leonard Woolf carefully registers his early impressions of Freud: he claims to be 'rather proud of having in I9I4 recognized and understood the greatness of Freud [... .] when this was by no means common'.7 His judgement of the importance and perspi cacity of Freud's ideas underlies Bloomsbury's awareness of the unconscious. And his observations in Growing (the second part of his autobiography) exhibit a distinctly analytical turn of mind, a consciousness of Freudian principles in which the jungle and its animals represent the unconscious and its libidinal impulses: Our life runs between metal lines like the trains and the old-fashioned trams. It has normally nothing to do with the jungle where wild beasts like the leopard and the 3 See Reginald Abbott, 'Birds Don't Sing in Greek: Virginia Woolf and "The Plumage Bill'", in Animals and Women: Feminist Theoretical Explorations, ed. by Carol J.

FARIS lOg elephant roam or even the human jungle where the human beast roams L...] the ego and the superego are far too strong for the id.8 However, it would seem that for the most part the presence of Bloomsbury's animals signals the workings of that unconscious id, of the underside of the consciously thoughtful life they habitually led, rather than a conscious element in the analysis of it. In that capacity Bloomsbury's beasts, like many other literary animals, often serve as symbols of the unconscious as Freud conceived of it, as containing the libidinal desires of the id, but they can also represent the more language-centred problems of that unconscious, which Freud also posits in his investigation of the dreamwork. As if he were exploiting that more linguis tically oriented side of the unconscious, Leonard Woolf uses Rilke's poem 'The Panther' as the epigraph for Beginning Again, which chronicles the years of the First World War, and then extends its vision of imprisonment to serve as an emblem of psychic life generally. Woolf claims that all throughout the war 'one felt that one was behind bars'. Furthermore, 'a terrible doubt' had come to him: 'there are other bars, permanent bars of the cage of one's life, through which one has always and will always gaze at the world. The bars of one's birth and family and ancestors, [. ...] of one's own secret and sinuous psychology'.9 Woolf reflects on this image, and, as often in this autobiography, it is difficult to dis entangle writing subject from portrayed self: Has not my mind, my soul, if I have a soul, for the last 82 years been pacing up and down like the panther, backwards and forwards, behind these bars and gazing though them until, so weary, I have seen, not the world or life, but only the bars - a thousand bars and behind the thousand bars no world? (Foreword) The animal becomes emblematic not only of the desires of the unconscious mind, but of an instinctual awareness of the ways in which those desires are contained by the discourses that enclose them. And finally, with the (uncharac teristic) mention of the soul, they trigger a specific metaphysical query. The (reportedly) rather savage act of the Ramsays' dog who bites Mr Tansley in Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse represents emotions temporarily breaking out of the discursive cage that Leonard Woolf describes: 'Even old badger without a tooth in his head had bit him, for being [. ...] the hundred and tenth young man to chase them all the way up to the Hebrides when it was ever so much nicer to be alone.'10 The children, who dislike Tansley and whom we glimpse later on 'disappearing as stealthily as stags from the dinnertable', report the bite with delight (p. ii). Thus the dog suggests the unruly emotional under side of the socially acceptable, accepting, and civilized upper middle-class family 8 Growing: An Autobiography of the Years 1904.-IQH (1961; London: Hogarth Press, 1977), pp. 53-54. 9 L.

In biting guests rather than welcoming them, the dog embodies the rebellious, self-defensive, half-civilized, and emotional pack, rather like the sea that swirls around the house, held in check by the dual lighthouses of Mrs and Mr Ramsay. Mrs Ramsay sees her husband's 'anger fly like a pack of hounds' when old Mr Carmichael, who reminds her of 'a cat watching birds' in his brooding solitude, asks for more soup (pp. I44-45). Again, the misbehaving animals suggest hidden, unsocial selves. So, in Mrs Dalloway, does Elizabeth Dalloway's dog: just as her mother's chic party is beginning, the narrator fusses that 'Jenny must remember the dog, Miss Elizabeth's fox-terrier, which, since it bit, had to be shut up', just as its mistress must behave correctly for this party, even though a part of her might rather bite than talk with the guests. 1I1 In Kristeva's terms, then, inasmuch as they are psychopomps, preceding us into the realms of unconscious desires (and horrors), perhaps animals embody her idea of the abject as the underside of the symbolic, as the unclean, anti social, and unstable elements of the self that are cast out in order to gain a stable identity, but hover ever after at the peripheries of that identity. Inasmuch as they are often our pets, animals can domesticate the abject; its power in them is not unleashed upon us but, rather, collared at our feet. Figuring the body of the mother and its associated realm of what Kristeva terms semiotic discourse, the presence of animals allows these abjected and unstable elements of the self, which are necessary for emotional well-being and cosmic connection to (mother) earth, to be present rather than totally excised. But it must be a covert presence, because that self must succeed in the symbolic discursive world. Thus post Victorian animals in general and Bloomsbury's animals in particular frequently figure the abject cosily, in Virginia Woolf's case keeping the feared realm of the sexual body and its uncontrollable emotions present but at bay. More specifically, Leonard and Virginia Woolf's fondness for animals remains a covert repository of the sentimentality they overtly rejected. In other terms, their animals are an escape from their egos. In a letter from Virginia to Leonard during her disturbed period in 1914 the sexual intimacy with her Woolf that was so problematic for her is domesticated: 'My pet, you would never doubt my caring for you if you saw me wanting to kiss you, and nuzzle you in my arms'. After Leonard's reply that her letter caused him to go 'to bed as happy as I can be not having the great Brute in person', she writes, 'I love your little ribby body, my pet'. 12 Note that Leonard's nickname for Virginia, 'the brute', seems to image her unmanageable and often virtually savage side, which is handily managed by the pettish cosiness of this interchange. However, that 11 Virginia Woolf, Mrs Dalloway (New York: Harcourt, Brace, &amp; World, 1925), p. 252. 12 Letters of Virginia Woolf, 11: igi2-ig22: The Question of Things Happening (1976), p. 45.</page><page sequence="5">WENDY B. FARIS III Leonard is a mongoose often referred to as a 'little' pet, while Virginia is often a 'great' brute, heightens her importance in the traditionally male-dominated sexual realm. Such domestication of awkwardly brutish sexual relations is again achieved via animal imagery in a letter from Virginia to Leonard: in it 'the Mandrill' 'wishes me to inform you delicately that her flanks and rump are now in finest plumage, and invites you to an exhibition'.'3 Virginia often signs her letters as 'Yr. Mandrill', and occasionally sends regards from other animals, confirming the role of animals as bearers of camouflaged emotion between intimates.14 Similarly, in a letter to Vanessa on the latter's marriage, Virginia masquerades as her sister's 'devoted beasts', three apes and a 'WOMBAT'.15 Finally, a photo of Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West illustrates this intimate connective function: the two women are not looking directly at each other, but are connected by Woolf's knee touching Sackville-West's leg, and holding two identical dogs.'6 The intimate sexual and emotional connection, which the two women do not express overtly, but which perhaps gives Sackville West her slightly defiant look, may be enhanced by the dog-to-dog connection. The brutishness that Leonard and Virginia Woolf camouflage with pet banter is more fully developed in the animal fable of marriage by David Garnett, Lady into Fox. As with Gregor Samsa's mutation in Kafka's Metamorphosis, the transformation in Garnett's story allows innate hostility to manifest itself. The bodily awkwardness occasioned by the attempts of human husband and fox-wife to live their lives in tandem suggests the radical incompatibility of males and females in marriage. It uses animals to figure unexpressed anger at the social norm of traditional heterosexual marriage, still firmly in place in 1922 despite considerable discussion. Mr Tebrick, after having failed to save his beloved wife turned-fox from the hounds, recovers from his wounds, goes mad, and then 'recovered his reason and lived to be a great age, for that matter he is still alive'.'7 Thus this animal fable is a tale of marital tragedy and individual success, for in it a man can be seen as successfully integrating his animal instincts. In achiev ing this goal, however, the foxy wife is sacrificed to the hounds, beastly hetero sexuality sacrificed to a (presumably) congenial and perhaps homosocial old age. The problematic selves and emotions that Bloomsbury's animals express are rarely the specifically bodily and sexual ones, however. Perhaps this is because the group focused intensely on the workings of the mind, and in addition championed sexual experimentation and expressiveness. The outstanding auto biographical example of a sexually charged animal image is Virginia Woolf's 13 Cited in Panthea Reid, Art and Affection: A Life of Virginia M^o/f (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 165-66. 14 Letters of Virginia Woof, 11, 90. 15 See Letters of Virginia Woof, vi: igj6-ig4i: Leave the Letters till We're Dead (1980), pp. 492-93. 16 Reproduced in Quentin Bell, Virginia Woolf: A Biography, 2 vols (London: Hogarth Press, 1972), 11, plate 14a. 17 David Garnett, Lady into Fox and A Man in the ?oo (1922, 1924; London: Hogarth Press, 1985), p. 91.</page><page sequence="6">II2 Bloomsbur's Beasts well-known portrait of her stepbrother George Duckworth as a pig underlying a prig. 18 In Woolf's satirical metaphors the odious George then proceeds from pig to sheep via a lascivious faun. In addition to suggesting his mental obtuse ness, the imagery expresses sexual disgust and long-repressed anger on Woolf's part. What is more, she contrasts the pig-like George with the butterfly Vanessa wears to go out with him. Given Woolf's portrayal of Vanessa as already a strong-minded artist who craves paint not parties, that butterfly is only margin ally emblematic of the delicate adolescent sexual feelings of the molested sisters. And if we recall that Woolf wished her writing to resemble a butterfly's wing undergirded with bolts of iron, it may also suggest the latent artistic talent in both young women. But most of all, the exaggerated contrast of pig and butter fly graphically embodies the mature Woolf's (retrospective) rage at the unequal and sexually charged contest between George and Vanessa. Thus, perhaps, a minor subset of Bloomsbury's beasts (inherited from the eighteenth century and earlier) is the satirical use of animal metaphors to criticize human behavior. Most often the implied critique addresses mental obtuseness, and the animals chosen have a reputation for low brainpower. Such is the case with Lytton Strachey's description of Florence Nightingale's opponent Lord Panmure as 'the Bison', a name that 'fitted both his physical demeanour and his habit of mind. That large low head seemed to have been created for butting rather than for anything else'.'9 In addition to occasionally representing the intractable body and serving as vehicles for satirical commentary, Bloomsbury's beasts also embody obstreperous and troubled minds in a more charitable mode. In the context of badly diagnosed and treated mental illness, the phenomenon of talking birds may symbolically represent freedom of verbal expression. The patient's unconscious can keep on talking, even as her body is confined to solitude, bed, and milk. Animals still permit the unconscious to act, but, in contrast to the sexual actions of a pig or a fox, here they embody verbal action. In Mrs Dalloway, as if to suggest a connection between madness, sensitivity, and creativity, Woolf duplicates her own experience of talking birds in Septimus Smith: a sparrow perched on the railing opposite chirped Septimus, Septimus, four or five times over and went on to sing freshly and piercingly in Greek words how there is no crime and, joined by another sparrow, they sang in voices prolonged and piercing in Greek words, from trees in the meadow of life beyond a river where the dead walk; how there is no death. (P. 28) Here also the birds may encode the semiotic in opposition to the symbolic order; they confirm Septimus's madness, but they also confirm his identity as a being 18 Virgina Woolf, '22 Hyde Park Gate', in Moments of Being: Unpublished Autobiographical Writings, ed.

FARIS II3 connected to the cosmos, and express his poetic sensibility, which causes him to feel that 'trees were alive. And the leaves [. . .] connected by millions of fibres with his own body', in contrast to the rational discourse of his doctors, who claim that nothing is wrong with him (p. 26). Since he cannot speak to himself in the park without provoking everyone's anxiety, the birds speak for him of the imag inary realms he longs to reach, realms where war and death do not exist, in which he does not outlive his friend Evans killed in the war. While most of London busies itself and forgets the war, Septimus's birds question that agenda and recall individual agonies that have not healed.20 Once again, shortly before he dies, 'the voices of birds singing' relieve Septimus from the 'human nature' that he feels is 'on us' in the form of his doctors (pp. 2II, 213). This use of animals to assert a fragile self in the world is again suggested by the Woolfs' simultaneous vow to open a printing press and buy a bulldog. Although Virginia was extremely sensitive to both actual and imagined criticism, shortly before the press and bulldog vows she apparently discovers for the first time that 'my writing now delights me solely because I love writing &amp; don't, honestly, care a hang what anyone says'.2' The dog is both the self asserting its rights and the other over whom it asserts those rights. Woolf is both its sister and its mistress. For Woolf, unfortunately, as Kristeva explains, this enjoyment of her own writing is usually a virtually 'unnamable otherness': she is unable to access this 'solid rock of jouissance and writing' directly, perhaps because it is experi enced 'beyond and through the paternal function', although its practice pervades her texts.22 In contrast to that robust bulldog, Clarissa Dalloway's fragile self, needing her husband's protection, is repeatedly pictured as a bird. However, despite Clarissa's conventional exterior, her mind and heart are decidedly her own; her animal spirit represents her independence as well as her timidity. Correspondingly, Richard Dalloway, who cares for Clarissa but whose deep feelings for her are not to be expressed in words, is described (erroneously, but significantly) as 'a man who cared only for dogs' again, affection expressed through an animal (p. 288). Somewhat like the Woolfs and the Dalloways, but in a different and more delicate register, Septimus and Rezia Smith's private life together transpires 20 For an intriguing discussion of the birds speaking in Greek, see Hermione Lee, Virginia Woof (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1997), pp. 191?4; According to Lee, in her essay 'On Not Knowing Greek' Woolf mentions the 'impersonality of Greek plays, with their choruses, "the undifferentiated voices who sing like birds in the pauses of the wind,'" and claims that no English poets can speak with the intensity of Aeschylus about the war, 'while the Greeks could use phrases like "Yet being dead they have not died'"; Virginia Woolf, 'On Not Knowing Greek', in Collected Essays, ed. by Leonard Woolf, 1 (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1969), pp. 5-6, 10. Thus Septimus's Greek birds may serve as something like the lament of Greek choruses and be directed at the war. 21 See the account of this period in Reid, pp. 170-80. 22 See Julia Kristeva, The Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection, trans, by Leon S. Roudiez (New York: Columbia University Press, 1982), p. 59.</page><page sequence="8">II4 Bloomsbur's Beasts through their metaphorical identity as birds. On first seeing Septimus, with 'his bright eyes, his way of sitting a little hunched', Rezia is reminded 'of a young hawk' (p. 222). Septimus is comforted by watching Rezia make hats, feeling her mind 'like a bird, falling from branch to branch, and always alighting, quite rightly, [ ...] like a bird', the cheer and appropriateness of the metaphorical bird's activities contrasting with Rezia and Septimus's own awkward movements around London, negotiating traffic, in and out of doctor's offices. Septimus imagines a fleeting moment of happiness as 'a pocket of still air' in which 'warmth still lingers, and the air buffets the cheek like the wing of a bird' (p. 2I8). Birds also make their way into things Rezia has written for Septimus and which they enjoy together, in contrast to one of Holmes's or Bradshaw's homes, which will separate them: drawings of 'little men and women brandishing sticks for arms, with wings were they? - on their backs' (p. 223), a written world linking them to 'the suns and stars' and 'waves' (pp. 223-24). That intimate, bird-like existence in which they are connected emotionally with each other and with the forces of the natural world is set poignantly against the public sphere of civilized reason, and constitutes a realm in which they are not in the doctors' power, a camouflaged power also expressed via an animal metaphor: 'Holmes and Bradshaw were on him! The brute with the red nostrils was snuffing into every secret place' (p. 223). The birds express the couple's inner sense of themselves in contrast to the views of them from outside observers, to whom 'both seemed queer' (p. 38). In the end, the birds are too gentle for the beasts, so to speak, and even though Rezia 'sat down beside him and called him by the name of that hawk or crow which being malicious and a great destroyer of crops was precisely like him', claims that 'no one could separate them', and Septimus 'could see her, like a little hen, with her wings spread, barring his [Holmes's] passage'. 'Holmes persevered', and the force of that perseverance seems almost to push Septimus out of the window, ending his and Rezia's metaphorical lives as intimately connected birds. Finally, in this category of animals that express hidden, repressed, or forbid den emotions or desires, near the start of A Room of One's Own a Manx cat without a tail leads to the question of the gender that was missing from the lawns - and libraries, lecture halls, and dining rooms of Oxbridge: 'The sight of that abrupt and truncated animal padding softly across the quadrangle changed by some fluke of the subconscious intelligence the emotional light for me. It was as if someone had let fall a shade'. Soon 'I watched the Manx cat pause in the middle of the lawn as if it too questioned the universe, something seemed lacking, something seemed different.' That cat initiates the speaking of the long unsaid. It appears in the midst of a luncheon in which animals are being eaten handily. As if to herald the importance of the cat's intervention, Woolf doubles her references to the animals that are being consumed. She claims that even</page><page sequence="9">WENDY B. FARIS II5 though 'it is part of the novelist's convention not to mention soup and salmon and ducklings, as if soup and salmon and ducklings were of no importance whatsoever', she goes on to describe the soles whose creamy sauce 'was branded here and there with brown spots like the spots on the flanks of a doe', and were followed by 'partridges, [ ...] partridges, many and various'.23 Shortly, we are introduced to the cat in an aside that virtually defines Bloomsbury's use of animals as markers of neglected topics. Speculating about the lack and difference the cat represents leads her to note the absence of women at pre-war college lunches, and eventually to describe a parallel and unsatisfying dinner in a women's college, where the only animal mentioned is wholly domesticated, and referred to only as an edible commodity: 'beef with its attendant greens and potatoes a homely trinity, suggesting the rumps of cattle in a muddy market' (p. 17). Earlier, Woolf has used animal imagery to take revenge on the men who are allowed into the chapel, whose precincts she would presumably be denied, by comparing them to 'giant crabs and crayfish who heave with difficulty across the sand of an aquarium', and invokes evolution to demolish them further: 'rare types which would soon be obsolete if left to fight for existence on the pavement of the Strand' (p. 8). They seem to represent lower forms of life. Is she suggesting that they are throwbacks to the swine that she imagines preceding them on a different kind of grass, as, finally, she puts them into a suitably dwarfed cosmic perspective, speculating that 'once, presumably, this quadrangle with its smooth lawns, its massive buildings, and the chapel itself was marsh too, where the grasses waved and the swine rootled' (p. 9)? Within this imaginary verbal menagerie, portrayals of individual repressions occasionally merge into treatments of social ones. This is certainly the case with the Manx cat. And, in Mrs Dalloway, after Septimus has stammered 'I I' twice and observed, quite correctly, that Holmes's motorcar must cost quite a lot, we move to Lady Bruton's luncheon table. There the goddess of Proportion, invoked by Sir William Bradshaw in connection with Septimus, and her sister in India, Conversion, reign (p. I53). Lady Bruton's social sanity is the opposite of Septimus's lonely madness, and as if to confirm society's cover-up of the latter by the former, the food is described as disguised animals: 'films of brown cream mask turbot' and 'in casseroles severed chickens swim'. Note how the chickens, though dead, still 'swim', and that they themselves, rather than just their less anthropomorphizable parts, are described as 'severed', a word that emphasizes the brutality of the act.24 23 Virginia Woolf, A Room of One's Own (1929; New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1957), pp. 10-11. 24 Woolf s strategy here resembles in a less overt way the one that Marian Scholtmeijer discusses in several fictions by women that posit a kinship between women and animals as victims: see 'The Power of Otherness: Animals in Women's Fiction', in Animals and Women, pp. 231-62. However, animals are on the periphery of Woolf s vision, so that she cannot really be aligned with a proto-ecofeminist ethos.</page><page sequence="10">I I 6 Bloomsbury's Beasts In To the Lighthouse, in contrast to this upper-crust culinary masking of life's underdogs, is the succulent bwuf en daube in which the earth's animals and flavours are melded not murdered, and served by Mrs Ramsay (a virtual embodi ment of the semiotic realm in contrast to her husband's near total dominance of and by the symbolic), who resonates with the natural world and with her own and her guests' feelings. As Mrs Ramsay dishes up the daube, an exquisite scent of olives and oil and juice rose from the great brown dish [...] And she must take great care, Mrs Ramsay thought, diving into the soft mass, to choose a specially tender piece for William Bankes. And she peered into the dish, with its shiny walls and its confusion of savoury brown and yellow meats, and its bay leaves and its wine. (pp. 150-51) Earlier, the rooks outside Mrs Ramsay's window, rising and falling like a net as she puts on her jewels for dinner, seem to constitute a kind of post-Romantic living web that connects Mrs Ramsay to her environment and reflects her emotional vicissitudes. They suggest her cosmic connections that complement the social ones she is about to activate at her dinner table. Consistent with the vision of animals and emotional underdogs as (disturbingly) serving the ends of the confident upper classes, clothes are some times seen as resembling protective colouring. Nancy Blow, for example, in Mrs Dalloway, 'dressed at enormous expense by the greatest artists in Paris, stood there, looking as if her body had merely put forth, of its own accord, a green frill' (p. 270). The image suggests that her wealth allows her to make use of the natural grace of animal life and its pleasing decorative qualities, rather than suffering from the inconvenient emotions of our primitive animal natures. Clarissa perceives her as an attractive animal who does not speak, only looks. Unlike the wild animals we shall see Leonard Woolf and E. M. Forster portray, she does not question social niceties but participates in them. In a similar vein, Virginia Woolf's essay on 'The Sun and the Fish' provides a surreptitious and admittedly momentary glimpse into the undressed bodies of fashionably dressed people and contrasts them unfavourably with the naturally adorned fish. The fish 'seem to have been shaped deliberately and slipped into the world only to be themselves'; on the other hand, it appears that: more care has been spent upon half a dozen fish than upon all the races of men. Under our tweed and silk is nothing but a monotony of pink nakedness. [ ...] Bankers have no claws. Kings and Queens themselves have neither ruffs nor frills. In short, if we were to be turned naked into an aquarium but enough.25 Woolf stops before articulating her comparison completely, but her image uses the animals whose varied physical attributes contrast with our own boringly 25 Virginia Woolf, 'The Sun and the Fish', in Collected Essays, ed. by Leonard Woolf, rv (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1969), pp. 182-83.</page><page sequence="11">WENDY B. FARIS II7 undifferentiated (and yet both enticing and frightening) naked flesh to question gently the artificially sartorially enhanced social niches we occupy. In this context Nancy Blow's escort seems to embody the social management of animal life. This young man may have 'the eyes of a bird', but 'ponies' mouths quivered at the end of his reins'. Like Lady Bradshaw 'in Court dress' and her husband, who both catch salmon, he rules rather than identifies with animals (P. 148). Unlike Septimus and Clarissa, who carry the animals within, indicating their inner turmoil, the well-dressed women, with their expensive animal-like frills of protective colouring, seem capable of ignoring their inner animalistic demons in favour of adapting to their social niches. The presence of these various camouflaged and domesticated animals is one form of partial avoidance in which Helene Cixous's 'abominable' enters Woolf's work, questioning psychological and social equilibrium. Although Woolf is more timid in her approach to the joyful but traditionally proscribed realm of 'jouissance' that Cixous celebrates in the texts of Clarice Lispector, animals such as the Manx cat, the birds speaking in Greek, or the masked turbot and severed chickens permit the hidden to be heard. In her investigation of 'a chain of associations and signifiers composed of birds, women, and writing', Cixous focuses on the opposition between what she following Lispector terms 'Those Bible' the biblical law and the 'immonde' or the unclean, an idea that originates in the animals, especially the birds, that the Bible declares impure and inedible. For Lispector as read by Cixous, those birds are associated with joy, jubilation, and writing. For Cixous, then, 'to be unclean with joy', 'immonde', is to be 'out of the world'. And 'out there, we shall be in the company of swans, storks, and griffons'- and birds speaking in Greek? Furthermore, she continues, since 'we are told by the law, "Thou shalt not eat of those birds, and thou shalt not read those books," [ ...] reading is a wonderful metaphor for all kinds of joy that are called vicious'.26 As we have been seeing, most of Bloomsbury's beasts are not really very beastly; and so they do not quite belong entirely to the world of Cixous's 'immonde'. But they allow the supremely conscious mind to approach it, to perceive the root that is the unconscious of the writing self, which inhabits 'les domaines inferieurs' (the nether realms), 'somewhere in that most evasive of countries without a precise address; the one that is most difficult to find and work with; [... ] This risky country is situated somewhere near the unconsious: to reach it you have to go through the back door of thought', the door through which animals also often enter the house. And for the aggressively secular post Victorian Bloomsbury, that country was not only the individual unconscious 26 H?l?ne Cixous, Three Steps on the Ladder of Writing, trans, by Sarah Cornell and Susan Sellers (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994), pp. 117?19.</page><page sequence="12">ii8 Bloomsbur's Beasts with its sexually charged demons or the actively writing female imagination that Cixous implies, but also the mystical domain of cosmic awareness with its repressed spiritual feelings.27 Thus another significant role of animals in Bloomsbury is that of cosmic connectors, a category that Rosenbaum, as we saw above, touches on briefly as 'mysticism' in his second 'cluster' of Bloomsbury values, and it is a role that contrasts with their function as social critics. When animals remain themselves and somewhat apart from the human world, they connect the humans who observe them to the cosmos.28 Furthermore, this role of cosmic bridge to the universe joins with the function of emotional bridge between people to form the delicate web of communal feelings and mysterious connections that constitute the famous 'luminous envelope' of life that Woolf, in her seminal essay on modern fiction, describes as the novelist's true subject. They form an essential link in Woolf's modernist version of a kind of non-hierarchical 'chain of being', the vitally interconnected universe of all things human, animal, and inanimate, in which, as Clarissa in Mrs Dalloway expresses it, she is a 'part, she was positive of the trees at home; of the house there, [. . .] being laid out like a mist between the people she knew best' (p. I2).29 Many years later Woolf's careful scrutiny of 'The Death of the Moth' specif ically evokes her sense of cosmic connection: 'the same energy which inspired the rooks, the ploughmen, the horses, and even, it seemed, the lean bare-backed downs, sent the moth fluttering from side to side of his square of the window pane'.30 That sense seems to relax the writer's habitual discipline: 'such vigour came rolling in from the fields and the down beyond that it was difficult to keep the eyes strictly turned upon the book' (p. 359). She marvels at the smallness of the moth that contains such a powerful life force, again making him the occasion to observe interconnections 'it seemed as if a fibre, very thin but pure, of the enormous energy of the world had been thrust into his frail and diminutive body' and then extending them to herself: because he was so small, and so simple a form of the energy that was rolling in at the open window and driving its way through so many narrow and intricate corridors in my 27 Cixous, p. 114. 28 This function connects Bloomsbury's beasts to the medieval tradition in which animals were imagined to have known of Christ's birth before humans did. 29 This cosmic dimension of Bloomsbury's beasts might have begun early for Woolf. To her godfather James Russell Lowell, the six-year old Virginia wrote: 'Have you been to the Adirondacks and have you seen lots of wild beasts and a lot of birds in their nests. You are a naughty man not to come here. Good bye. Your affecte Virginia'; reproduced in Elizabeth P. Richardson, A Bloomsbury Iconography (Winchester: St Paul's Bibliog raphies, 1989), plate 4. Perhaps her curiosity about the American landscape with its greater wildness and imagined freedom to wander at will is expressed by Virginia in animal terms. And even if one were to be a wild beast, one would still be at home in one's nest, even though free to express wild or inappropriate emotions. In such a setting Lowell is allowed to be naughty, and Virginia to tell him so. 30 Virginia Woolf, 'The Death of the Moth', in Collected Essays, ed. by Leonard Woolf, 1 (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1966), p. 359.</page><page sequence="13">WENDY B. FARIS II9 own brain and in those of other human beings, there was something marvellous as well as pathetic about him. (p. 360) The tiny moth thus allows her to confront calmly the most terrible adversary of all: 'the moth having righted himself now lay most decently and uncomplain ingly composed. Oh yes, he seemed to say, death is stronger than I am' (p. 36I). In confronting 'a power of such magnitude' as death, the moth would presumably belong to the category of 'facing' mysticism that Martin Corner claims Woolf favours outside of her major novels and also in the portrait of Lily Briscoe in To the Lighthouse. When the moth is dying, 'the power', which earlier had animated him and the horses and birds and Woolf herself, 'was there all the same, massed outside indifferent, impersonal. [ ...] Somehow it was opposed to the little hay-coloured moth'. Corner distinguishes this 'facing' mysticism from the 'fusing' kind, which he associates with Mrs Ramsay's dominant mode. The difference is that the self, in 'fusing' mysticism, merges with an object or the world at large, while in 'facing' mysticism it confronts something 'of a different order from that given in commonplace awareness', but 'no fusing takes place'. Corner sees the 'facing' variety of Woolf's mysticism as more compatible with her atheism. That may be, but the distinction is not always easy to maintain, for Woolf's description of the energy that inspires rooks, moth, and her own brain seems both to merge individuals with each other and with the cosmos and to face the larger implacable universe.31 To unpack the narratological implications of the sentence cited above about the moth embodying the same energy that was rolling in at the window and coursing through brains is to glimpse the interwoven interior monologues of Woolf's fiction, so that the small animal that ostensibly distracts her from her writer's duty ultimately leads towards the achievement of her major literary goals. On the occasions when they provide outlets for repressed thoughts or actions, animals may serve in a minor way to signal 'the point of interest' that for the moderns, Woolf thinks, 'lies very likely in the dark places of psychol ogy',32 digging caves behind characters that are inhabited by animals in penumbra, but caves that are interconnected. The net of birds that reappears here confirms this sense of a worldwide web of mysterious connections furthered by the presence of animals: 'the rooks too were keeping one of their annual festivities; soaring round the tree tops until it looked as if a vast net with thousands of black knots in it had been cast up into the air'.33 Inasmuch as they are not controllable, the presence of animals in Woolf's texts thus contributes 31 See Martin Corner, 'Mysticism and Atheism in To the Lighthouse', in Virginia Woof's lb the Lighthouse, ed. by Harold Bloom (New York: Chelsea House, 1988), pp. 43-58 (p. 45). 32 Virginia Woolf, 'Modern Fiction', in Collected Essays, ed.

Because, for the most part, Mrs Dalloway is so clearly a paean to the bustling metropolis, it is significant to see a virtually hidden appearance of cosmic animal life even here, confirming that this presence is small but pervasive. Besides Clarissa's identity as a bird a being who symbolically joins earthly and airy regions with the old woman singing, whom Peter Walsh sees at an entrance to a tube station (an opening that takes modern Londoners into the earth), Woolf includes an ancient earth goddess and her burbling spring in her portrait of contemporary London, suggesting a mystical sympathy with the earth and its creatures: 'as the ancient song bubbled up opposite Regent's Park Tube Station, still the earth seemed green and flowery [... .] still the old bubbling burbling song, soaking through the knotted roots of infinite ages' (p. 124). There is only one animal associated with this figure, but it connects her to and perhaps even suggests the future psychological development of the bird-like Clarissa, in whom this earthy dimension is largely lacking, for she 'twittered' and has 'the bird-like freshness of the very aged' (p. 124). Closer to home, another such hint of earthy animal life appears: during her mother's fashionable party, not only has Elizabeth Dalloway's town dog had to be shut away, but Elizabeth thinks she hears her other dog howling in the country twice; even when she is happy at her father's complimenting her on her beauty, 'her poor dog was howling', suggesting a private part of her self connected to the country, which is not involved in London's social whirl (p. I96). As I have begun to suggest above, then, these animals that serve as both inter human and cosmic liaisons underlie Woolf's streams of consciousness as they combine individual psychology with a sense of cosmic mystery. Kristeva notes in her essay on abjection that slhe will set aside 'a different version of the confrontation with the feminine, one that, going beyond abjection and fright, is enunciated as "ecstatic" [because ... ] [t]hat kind of confrontation appears, where our civilization is concerned, only in a few rare flashes of writing'.35 But that elision may not be necessary here. While it may be too daring to posit a strong connection between the abject and the ecstatic in Woolf's fiction, the elated quality of her prose may constitute just such a rare flash of writing as it 34 Virginia Woof's Major Novels: The Fables of Anon (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1980), p. 118. 35 Kristeva, Powers of Horror, p. 59.</page><page sequence="15">WENDY B. FARIS I21 moves ubiquitously between despair and elation in the minds of Mrs Dalloway, Septimus, Rezia, Mrs Ramsay, and Lily Briscoe, and hence begins to configure an imaginary space that combines the feminine and the ecstatic. Both Leonard Woolf and E. M. Forster, perhaps influenced by Buddhist and Hindu thought, portray animals as figures of cosmic relatedness. And, like many colonists, they extend this animal cosmic connection to natives. (Leonard Woolf is attracted to the 'earthiness' of the Sinhalese, who 'retain something of the litheness and beauty of jungle animals'.36) Several times in his reminiscences of Ceylon, Woolf's doubts about the rational denial of the soul's existence seem to be confirmed by his interactions with animals, who communicate across the bars of the social world and connect the soul with its cosmic home. Such moments are not devoid of literary subtexts, however, for in them Woolf's discursive model shifts from enlightened prose to Romantic poetry. As we have seen in his discussion of Rilke, Woolf the efficient British bureaucrat and Woolf the Romantic nature mystic are both on show in Growing, and the animals he describes mediate between these two sides of his personality. Domination of the animal coexists with sympathetic identification. Woolf, we learn in Growing, encounters various animals in his Ceylon years, but his dog Charles and his pet deer will serve to represent these two poles. The valiant Charles turns out to be an invaluable asset to his youthful master's colonialist ambitions (now of course regarded ironically by the mature memorialist): my reputation as a good fellow, a Sahib, a man not to be trifled with, was [...] estab lished within three hours of my arrival, for a civil servant, wearing bright green flannel collars and accompanied by a dog who within the space of ten minutes had killed a cat and a large snake, commanded immediate respect. (p. 40). This is clearly not an example of mystic cosmic relatedness but of imperial mastery. The deer, however, is another matter. Predictably, he is much less domes ticated than the good Charles, and as his horns grew, 'though he remained very affectionate to me [... .], his temper with other people became uncertain' (p. ioo). He finally gores a man and has to be shot. This story occasions a reflection on Woolf's part that includes both the overt Bloomsbury antipathy to a sentimental view of animals as well as his own dissent from that view. After acknowledging that Lytton Strachey and other intellectuals may be right in accusing him of animal sentimentality, he maintains that there is something more to it. If you really understand an animal so that he gets to trust you completely and, within his limits, understands you, there grows up between you affection of a purity and simplicity which seems to me peculiarly satisfactory. There is also a cosmic strangeness about animals which always fascinates me and gives to my affection for them a myste rious depth and background. (p. ioo) 36 Growing, p. 54. Further references appear in the text.</page><page sequence="16">122 Bloomsbur's Beasts Inasmuch as they refuse to fit into human categories, animals here serve as screens for a projection of the cosmic self that ignores such categories and values individuals alone in the universe: the moment you try to fit into these elaborate cosmological fantasies my cat, my dog, my leopard, my marmoset, with their strange minds, fears, affections their souls if there is such a thing as a soul you see that they make nonsense of all philosophies and religions. (p. ioi) Here again, the mystical feeling of a soul, which Woolf's modernist intellect is compelled to doubt, has been evoked by the presence of an animal. Clearly, for Leonard Woolf, part of the attraction of animals inheres in the coincidence they embody between the subject who speaks and the subject of the spoken (as formulated by Lacan), which means that they always express them selves as they are, rather than representing themselves with an agenda.37 Woolf himself aims at such a coincidence, at a kind of animal honesty, but, as he says, the nature of the human mind, divided as it is between conscious and unconscious thoughts, means that even though he has 'tried in the following pages to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, [ ...] of course I have not succeeded' (p. 9).John Berger's statement about animals further clarifies Woolf's intuitions about communicating with animals by defining our relations to them: animals are always the observed. The fact that they can observe has lost all significance. They are objects of our everextending knowledge. What we know about them is an index of our power, and thus an index of what separates us from them. The more we know, the further away they are.38 However, within this complex dynamics of colonized and colonizer, of observed and observing eyes, Berger's consciousness of this distance, like Woolf's comple mentary Romantic identification with the beast, begins to erode that dichotomy. As Berger notes immediately following this observation, another social trend posits nature and the animal as 'a value concept'. And 'the life of a wild animal becomes an ideal, an ideal internalized as a feeling surrounding a repressed desire, [.. .] the starting-point of a daydream'. Thus both Berger and Woolf implicitly assert the rights of an animal to its own perspective, without anthro pomorphizing that perspective and co-opting it as a commentary on human society.39 And for Woolf the reluctant imperialist, that attitude coincides with 37 Jacques Lacan, Ecrits (Paris: Seuil, 1966), p. 807. 38 John Berger, About Looking (New York: Pantheon, 1980), pp. 14-15. 39 The representations of animals I discuss here certainly do not go as far as those created by writers of the 'realistic animal stories' studied by Allen Burns in his article 'Extensions of Vision: The Representation of Non-Human Points of View', Papers on Language and Literature, 38.4 (2002), 339-50. Henry Williamson, for example, rewrote his story of Tarka the Otter (1927) seventeen times to excise all anthropomorphism. However, they do seem to share the desire to avoid rational human thought with such writers, and thus to 'keep alive a serious and ultimately ethical interest in the workings of animal minds, in what amounts to a kind of signifi cant counter-statement to some of the dominant intellectual trends of the twentieth century' (Burns, p. 345). Such an interest works towards a more inclusive vision of discourse.</page><page sequence="17">WENDY B. FARIS 123 his attempts to see the other side, to interpret events from the Ceylonese point of view. Earlier, in Howards End, not a live animal but its ritual remains -the repeat edly noticed pig's teeth in the Wych Elm that overhangs the house of the title - play a crucial role in the symbolic geography of Forster's novel. Something of a Romantic throwback, they represent the house's connection to ancient lore, its rightful owner's reverence for nature in opposition to the encroachments of industrial society, and her right to subvert patriarchal heritage by bequeathing her house to another cosmically connected woman. Similarly, in A Passage to India, a wasp serves as the vehicle of cosmic connec tion, embodying Corner's category of 'fusing' mysticism. Chosen specifically for its traditionally lowly place in the evolutionary scale, it represents the encom passing nature of a spiritual perspective that can include even it. This is not the perspective of 'little talkative Christianity', whose missionaries are debating what circles of life invitations should include: yes; he saw no reason why monkeys should not have their collateral share of bliss. [...] And the jackals? Jackals were indeed less to Mr. Sorley's mind, but he admitted that the mercy of God, being infinite, may well embrace all mammals. And the wasps? He became uneasy during the descent to wasps, and was apt to change the conversation.40 In obvious contrast, the previous chapter ends with Mrs Moore admiring a wasp, an encounter that leads her towards an oceanic feeling of oneness with the rest of the world, with even the 'jackals in the plain' who 'bayed their desires and mingled with the percussion of drums': "'Pretty dear," said Mrs. Moore to the wasp. He did not wake, but her voice floated out, to swell the night's uneasiness' (p. 35).41 In Mrs Dalloway, in a similar moment of cosmic embrace, Mrs Dalloway includes 'dogs and canaries' in her list of beings to whom 'one must pay back from this secret deposit of exquisite moments', which seem to be a kind of substi tute for God, since they are mentioned as a corrective to her denial of belief in him (p. 43). Near the end of A Passage to India, after Mrs Moore's death, Professor Godbole recalls her, and, unknowingly, virtually repeats her act: Godbole [. ...] remembered an old woman he had met in Chandrapore days. [...] she happened to occur among the throng of soliciting images, a tiny splinter, and he 40 E. M. Forster, A Passage to India (1924; New York: Harcourt, Brace, &amp; World, 1952), p. 38. Further citations are to this edition and are given in the text. 41 See Marianna Torgovnick, Primitive Passions: Men, Women, and the Search for Ecstasy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996) for a discussion of the feeling of oceanic oneness, which the author associates with a female sensibility, but which she also maintains is present in the works of 'novelists and poets such as William Blake, Emily Bront?, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, Virginia Woolf, and Dylan Thomas', and as having been 'wounded' by 'the primacy of [. . .] philosophies of self and property' that have been 'fundamental to the Western imagination'. She cites J. G. Herder, who sounds very much like Septimus Smith and the narrator of 'The Death of the Moth', as feeling that 'the power, which thinks and acts in me, is, from its nature, as eternal as that which holds together the Sun and stars' (p. 216).</page><page sequence="18">124 Bloomsbury's Beasts impelled her by his spiritual force to that place where completeness can be found. [. . [H]e remembered a wasp seen he forgot where, perhaps on a stone. He loved the wasp equally, he impelled it likewise, he was imitating God. (p. 286) In this spontaneous spiritual conjoining, Godbole creates a moment of cosmic consciousness, which he only delicately suggests as an end to his ecstasy: "'One old Englishwoman and one little, little wasp," he thought, as he stepped out of the temple into the grey of a pouring wet morning. "It does not seem much, still it is more than I am myself"' (p. 29I). Forster, typically, both elevates and ironizes the 'divine mess' of this ecstatic Hindu celebration, during which even 'the flies awoke and claimed their share of God's bounty' (p. 285). In contrast to the wasp, the horses in the novel's final paragraph, which are ridden and reined by men, are allied with a divisive and historically encoded sky, which denies present satis faction to the desires of Fielding and Aziz for intimate and lasting friendship. But even so, Godbole's and Mrs Moore's mystical cosmic communion via the wasp still buzzes in our mind's ear. I have left the most thoroughly textualized Bloomsbury beast for last, because, like Forster's horses, he is very un-beastlike. Virginia Woolf's biography of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's dog Flush seems to me to be the exception that proves the rules I have been proposing here. Rather than intruding on a narrative devoted to other subjects, questioning their autonomy, just as the unconscious intrudes on and questions the ego's autonomy, Flush is focused on directly, anthropomorphized both in story and discourse, which are here conflated: 'naturally, lying with his head pillowed on a Greek lexicon, he came to dislike barking and biting'.42 With his head on the verbal origins of Western culture, Flush and his novel are thoroughly civilized - recalling the distinction I suggested at the outset embodying rather more a consciously analytical presence of the unconscious than a covertly functional one. Flush is topside, we might say, rather than underside, like many of Bloomsbury's other beasts. Flush is atypical in another illuminating way. When he gets to Italy, the open door of Casa Guidi encourages him to be sexually promiscuous: Now Flush knew what men can never know love pure, love simple, love entire; love [...] that has no shame; no remorse; that is here, that is gone, as the bee on the flower is here and is gone. [... .] So variously, so carelessly Flush embraced the spotted spaniel down the alley, and the brindled dog and the yellow dog it did not matter which. (pp. 76-77). Once out of London, in a parody of English cliches about the sexual freedom enjoyed in Italy, Flush becomes the beast he has never been. Even here he coincides with his mistress, for a few pages earlier we learn: 42 Virginia Woolf, Flush (1933; New York: Penguin, 1978), p. 32.</page><page sequence="19">WENDY B. FARIS 125 Flush heard her say 'Robert,' 'my husband,' fifty times a day. L...] She was a different person altogether. [... .] And just as Mrs. Browning was exploring her new freedom and delighting in the discoveries she made, so Flush too was making his discoveries and exploring his freedom. (pp. 73-75). But he coincides only in part, for she, after all, is a faithful and passionate wife. In any case, that momentary promiscuity points to a difference between Bloomsbury's literary animals and Victorian ones, the latter embodied by the non-Bloomsburyesque Flush. As I have suggested briefly above, inasmuch as Bloomsbury did achieve a sexual revolution of sorts, albeit a limited one, its animals are less likely to bear the projections of unsatisfied sexual desire than they were in the immediate past. Whereas other Victorian and even post Victorian animals (like the rabbit in Women in Love, which suggests both the repressed and the savage nature of Gudrun and Gerald's passion), often served as emblems of repressed sexuality, Bloomsbury's animals tend to embody a less sexual and a more social or spiritual agenda, undermining prevailing Victorian beliefs in science and evolutionary progress.43 However, like many Romantic animals, these occasional beasts in largely urban Bloomsbury are a particular instance of a ubiquitous primitivism industrial civilization's use of animals to reconnect with the natural world that recedes before its advances. Perhaps they also connect the communal side of Bloomsbury to its individualism. In contrast to the Freudian discourses of the self, these worlds of cosmic nature and theJungian collective unconscious have received less attention, both then and now.44 While the daringly pronounced word 'semen' may have characterized a phase (according to Woolf's famous account) of sexually explicit Bloomsbury conversations, the awkward, sentimen tal, even cautiously reverent emotions connected to the animals lurking in its margins were not always so severely, brilliantly, cerebrally managed.45 43 The evidence for this tendency in Virginia Woolf s writing, in contrast to its presence in Leonard's, is slim. A shred: during the period in which she was writing Flush, she notes in her diary that from the Sussex land scape emanated a '"holiness"' that '"will go on after I'm dead'"; cited in Reid, p. 353. 44 An exception to this trend is Jane Marcus's essay 'Britannia Rules The Waves', which implicitly suggests Woolf s sensitivity to such an oceanic sensibility by associating the progression of the sun in the sky that struc tures the narrative of The Waves with a Gayatri mantra, a 'random natural recurrence' that counters 'the myth of individualism and selfhood that fuels English patriotism and nationalism'; in Decolonizing Tradition: New Views of Twentieth-Century 'British' Literary Canons, ed. by Karen R. Lawrence (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1992), pp. 155, 137. 45 See Woolf s account in her memoir 'Old Bloomsbury', in Moments of Bang, ed. with an introduction and notes by Jeanne Schulkind (New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1976).</page></plain_text>
