BUNTA Marquette University Milwaukee, Wl 53233 Scholars have long noted that the Book of Ezekiel as a whole presents particularly puzzling exegetical difficulties. The manuscript witnesses differ at many points and the meanings are often ambiguous.1 In 1954, in a major article in which he attempted to solve several of these textual and semantic difficulties in the book, G. R. Driver contended that the original of Ezek 28: 12 contained the phrase I am much indebted to Professor Deirdre Dempsey of Marquette University for her useful comments, suggestions, and criticism of this article. All errors that remain are, of course, my respon- sibility alone. 1 For issues concerning the unity and coherence of the book, see especially Walter Zimmerli, "The Special Form- and Traditio-Historical Character of Ezekiel's Prophecy," VT 15 (1965) 515-27; Moshe Greenberg, "What Are Valid Criteria for Determining Inauthentic Matter in Ezekiel?" in Ezekiel and His Book: Textual and Literary Criticism and Their Interrelation (BETL 74; ed.

The LXX preserves a signifi- cantly different reading, namely, ¿71009 pay lapa opoubaeaK; ("imprint of like- ness"). Driver approaches the two versions as divergent and concludes that neither version is fully truthful to the original. According to him, on the one hand, the MT departs from the original by vocalizing a noun, Dmn, as an active participle, and, on the other hand, the LXX version is the product of the misreading of rPJDD ("per- fection or careful preparation") as rpinn ("pattern, likeness").4 Driver's arguments have been followed strictly by subsequent analyses and translations of Ezek 28: 12. 5 My primary purpose in this article is to address criti- cally Driver's conclusions. Although Driver's proposal appears linguistically viable and exegetically attractive, it is methodologically flawed. Driver did not address several basic hermeneutical questions in regard to the divergence between the LXX and the MT versions. First, the possibility that the original text lies not behind the divergence between the two versions but behind their congruence is not even con- sidered. Second, Driver did not supply the original text that he reconstructs with a context and a meaning. A close analysis of textual testimonies about exilic and 2G. R.

Textual evi- dence suggests that the destruction of the statue of Yhwh in the First Temple and of the temple itself necessitated a reformulation of the presence of Yhwh and of the sacred space. A mentality profoundly liturgical, presumably promoted by priestly circles and shared by Ezekiel, thus proposed a new numinous concept and anthro- pomorphic presence, TOD, and a new statue or theomorphism, Adam. I argue that the LXX version of Ezek 28:12 reflects this shift in exilic Judahite ideology. I. Text Ezekiel 28 describes an Adamic figure, namely, the king of Tyre, as oriin rpļļlfl, according to the MT, or as ànoo&lt;ppàyiG[ia ópoicòascoç, according to the LXX. The MT reading is partially supported by Aquila (acppaylç ¿Toipaaicov) and Theodotion (ocppaylc; èToipaaiaç). Driver, in his influential publication in 1954, solves the difference between the two readings in favor of a revised MT version, a decision uncontested by much of the ensuing scholarship. First, Driver deduces from the parallelism of Dmn with and from the descriptive value of that the former term must have, in the original, been the noun Dnin ("seal").6 He does not consider the possibility that what he deems a radical divergence in need of being solved one way or the other - namely, the difference between ren- dering the first term of the expression with a noun (LXX) or a participle (MT) - could reflect an original form that could have equally generated both readings. Driver notes that the masoretes read Dmn of Ezek 28:12 as the qal active partici- ple form of Dnn (i.e., "sealing" or "sealer"). Contrary to Driver's assumption, the LXX ÙTiocKp pay topa, although a noun, could also reproduce an original particip- ial form. Moreover, 071009 pay lopa could not aptly translate the noun Dmn. Driver remarks that Dmn denotes "the seal which makes the imprint, not the imprint made by the seal."7 Dmn is generally translated in the LXX by 09payic; (e.g., Exod 28: 1 1, 28, 36; 1 Kgs 21:8; Hag 2:23; Cant 8:6; Sir 42:6), but in one instance it is ren- dered by ôoktúXioc; (Gen 38:18). The term àTTOCKppáyiapa, however, denotes just the contrary, namely, the imprint made by a seal, not the seal that makes the impres- sion.8 It therefore corresponds semantically to the Hebrew qal passive participle, which denotes the result or the completed state of an action. Moreover, Hebrew participles have both a verbal and a nominal value. The nominal value of a passive 6 Driver, "Ezekiel," 159. 7 Ibid. 8 Callender unnecessarily blurs this semantic difference between Dmn, "signet," and à7roa(ppáyi(jpa by asserting that "a seal impression is best taken as evidence of the seal" {Adam in Myth and History, 92-93 n. 192).</page><page sequence="4">YHWH'S CULTIC STATUE AFTER 597/586 B.C.E. 225 participle is augmented in a construction with a noun in genitivus auctoris. Such constructions of passive participles could be translated into Greek in two ways: 1 . They could be translated with a passive participle with dativus auctoris, since in Greek the complementai agentive case is the instrumental dative, not the genitive.9 In the LXX, Deut 32:24, fļtih ''önVl mn "TO, is translated with the pas- sive participle and dativus auctoris, TiļKopevoi Xip&lt;I) Kai ßpcbaei. These construc- tions, however, are rarely employed, and only with impersonal agentives. The more common option would be to introduce an agentive noun analytically. In Isa 62: 12, mm is translated XeXurpcofiévov ímò Kupíou. In Sir 45:1, Wtim mm is translated recorri pé vov únò 0eou Kal àv0pcí)Tta)v. mm ļimi of Gen 26:29 is also translated with eùXoyriTÒc; ímò Kupíou, although verbal adjectives in -toc; and -teoc; generally require dativus auctoris. Most Hebrew passive participle constructions, however, are simply avoided (Gen 41:6; Exod 28:11; Isa 53:4). ofisa 1 :7 is conveniently translated with TiupÍKauoToi. A second occurrence of mm "pin, in Gen 24:3 1 , is misread as EÙXoyrjTÒc; KÚpioç. 2. The other option would be the nominalization of the participle in a con- struction with a noun in genitivus subiectivus. In two instances in the LXX a Hebrew passive participle in construction with a genitivus auctoris is rendered with a noun: UV ''IDI DTK nETin in Ps 22:7 (LXX 21 :7) becomes oveiôoç àvOpumou Kal èÇouôévrjpa Xaoö.10 Therefore, the congruence between the MT and LXX versions of Ezek 28: 12, the translatability into Greek of Hebrew constructions of passive participles with agentive nouns, and the testimony of Ps 22:7 suggest that a7ioacpp(ryi(j[ia ópoicbaecoc; translates a Hebrew passive participle (mnn) with a noun in genitivus auctoris and not a nominal construction (rmipri omn), as Driver suggests.11 It remains to be explained how a passive participle in the original text of Ezek 28: 12 could have been read as an active participle in the MT. A passive qal participle could have been rendered in the original in scriptio plena or defectively.12 It is, however, more probable that in the original text of 9 Passive participles with genitivus auctoris are not idiomatic in Greek. The only occurrences in the NT (Matt 25:34, oi eù'oyr|pévoi toū naipóq aou; Luke 2:27, tò eiôiapévov toõ vópou) seem to constitute Aramaisms. 10 It is also evident that the first term of the phrase YEvvriTÒç/yevvrjToi YuvaiKÓç/yuvaiKiIrv (LXX Job 14: 1 ; 15:14; 25:4; Matt 1 1 : 1 1 ; Luke 7:28) functions as a noun. The construction exhibits Semitic influences. In idiomatic Greek, the second term of the phrase should be in dativus auctoris. 11 anootppayiapa translates a form Dnin in a second instance, Jer 22:24, which, however, seems to refer to a ring on the right hand of Yhwh and ànoacppayiapa is an inapt translation. 12 The primitive forms of the active and passive participles were *qātil (whence qõtêl ) and *qatūl respectively (Hans Bauer and Pontus Leander, Historische Grammatik der hebräischen Sprache des alten Testamentes [rpt.; Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1962] 317-18; and Paul Joüon, S.J., and Takamitsu Muraoka, A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew [Rome: Editrice Pontificio Istituto Biblico, 1996] 147).</page><page sequence="5">226 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 69,2007 Ezek 28:12 the passive participle was rendered defectively. First, the defective spelling is generally regarded as earlier and thus more likely for an autograph of the early sixth century b.c.e.13 Second, the plene spelling of ū in interior positions would still be uncommon in the exilic period.14 Third, statistics suggest that in qal passive participles the ū in unstressed positions and in proclitics and constructs, as would be the case with the phrase in Ezek 28: 12, manifested the greatest resistance to plene spelling (212 defective versus 340 plene spellings in such cases and respectively 32 defective versus 85 piene in all other cases; 38 percent versus 27 percent defective spellings).15 Fourth, the MT still retains defective spellings of passive participles in the text of Ezekiel, although haphazardly (e.g., Ezek 9:2, 3).16 The defective forms of passive participles are identical to the regular defec- tive spellings of active participles. The increasingly plene rendering of passive participles at later times reflects an attempt to distinguish them from the active participles.17 In this process, the rendering of an originally defective passive par- ticiple as a plene active participle could very well constitute a scribal error. Scribes often updated a succinct consonantal text to the increasingly fuller spelling and were prone to (mis)vocalize in the process a consonantal text to a reading that was the most meaningful or clear/uncomplicated to them.18 The process constituted ultimately a constant interpretation (unintentional and subconscious or not), 13 For the historical primacy of the defective spelling, see Francis I. Andersen and A. Dean Forbes, Spelling in the Hebrew Bible (Dahood Memorial Lecture; Rome: Biblical Institute, 1986); James Barr, The Variable Spelling of the Hebrew Bible (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989); Werner Weinberg, "The History of Hebrew Plene Spelling," HUCA 46 (1975) 457-87; Joiion and Muraoka, Grammar, 46-50. For the relevance of the Qumran testimonies to this trend, see Elisha Qimron, The Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls (HSS 29; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1986) 17-18. The MT still retains 271 instances of defective spellings of passive qal participles (Andersen and Forbes, Spelling, 202; Joiion and Muraoka, Grammar, 148). 14 On the plene writing of word-medial ū, see Andersen and Forbes, Spelling, 57-67. It is apparently the extension of an original plene spelling of a word-final w. Influential in this transfer seems to have been the pronunciation of proper names, which are spelled with an interior plene ū by the seventh century b.c.e. The first attestation of plene ū in interior position in a common word is "ITIN in the Silwan Epitaph of late eighth or early seventh century. The plene spelling of interior ū, however, has normalized at a slow pace. By the beginning of the exile, the plene spelling of medial ū was "in train, but not on a large scale" (p. 67). 15 Andersen and Forbes, Spelling, 202. 16 Barr, Variable Spelling, 113. 17 The active participle has 1,040 plene spellings versus 4,269 defective. For statistics, see Andersen and Forbes, Spelling, 129; Joiion and Muraoka, Grammar, 49, 148. The discrepancy between the predominantly plene spelling of passive participles and the predominantly defective spelling of active participles is most probably the product of a late postexilic attempt to normalize the two spellings in dissimilar manners, in order to facilitate distinction or recognition. 18 See P. Kyle McCarter, Jr., Textual Criticism : Recovering the Text of the Hebrew Bible (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1986) 53-54, 57.</page><page sequence="6">YHWH'S CULTIC STATUE AFTER 597/586 B.C.E. 227 not solely on ideological grounds but often for reasons simply grammatical or semantic. In this interpretative process a defective passive participle could be readily updated to a plene form of an active participle. Several linguistic and semantic considerations could have prompted such an update in the case of Ezek 28:12. First, passive participles are statistically much less frequent in biblical texts than active participles (1,089 passive forms versus 5,309 active forms). Second, only very rarely do passive participles form constructions with agentive nouns. Active relative clauses are generally preferred to passive participles with agents. Paul Joiion notes that in Hebrew "en principe une forme proprement passive ne s'em- ploie que si l'auteur de l'action (l'agent) n'est pas nommé. Ainsi une phrase telle que Te sang innocent versé par Joab' doit normalement devenir en hébreu Te sang innocent qu'a versé Joab.'"19 Third, in cases in which passive participles do form constructions with agentive nouns, the nouns generally stand in analytical con- structions with 10 (originally derivative), 2 (originally instrumental), and *7 (orig- inally relational).20 The MT contains only nine constructions (including Isa 53:4) of passive participles with synthetic nouns in genitivus auctoris, not counting the most probable occurrence in the original of Ezek 28: 12. 21 The vast majority of participial constructions are active participles and nouns in the accusative, as the MT actually reads the construction in Ezek 28: 12.22 Ezekiel, however, seems to have been fond of constructions with passive participles; several constructions of passive participles of verba inuendi vel exuendi with nouns in the accusative are still extant in the MT (Ezek 9:2, 3, 11; 23:6, 12; 38:4). Therefore, given the evident general tendency toward active relative clauses and analytical constructions, the increasingly rare synthetic constructions of pas- sive participles and agentive nouns would have appeared antiquated and would have constituted good candidates for an update.23 The vocalization of the conso- 19 Paul Joiion, Grammaire de I ' hébreu biblique (Rome: Biblical Institute, 1923) 400-401 . See also Joiion and Muraoka, Grammar, 482-83; Thomas O. Lambdin, Introduction to Biblical Hebrew (New York: Scribner, 1971) 158; Bruce K. Waltke and M. O'Connor, An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1990) 616-17. 20 For the preponderance of these analytical constructions in the MT, see Joiion and Muraoka, Grammar, 482-84. For the preponderance of analytical constructions at Qumran, see Jean Carmi- gnac, "Le Complément d'Agent après un Verbe Passif dans l'Hebreu et l'Araméen de Qumrân," RevQ 35 (1978) 409-27. 21 To the list of Joiion and Muraoka ( Grammar, 417) one might add also Isa 62:12 and Eccl 45:1. Isaiah 54:13 could contain another passive participle, although the MT vocalizes "'Tift1? as a noun. Passive participles with nouns in the accusative are limited to verba inuendi vel exuendi. It is still disputed whether passive participles function as active in such constructions. 22 See Joiion and Muraoka, Grammar, 415-16. Active participles with genitives are rare and generally limited to verbs of motion; see Joiion and Muraoka, Grammar, 416. 23 For vestiges of genitival constructions at Qumran, see Carmignac, "Le Complément</page><page sequence="7">228 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 69,2007 nantal passive participle Dnn as an active participle DDin could have been prompted by the semantic peculiarity of an uncommon construction.24 The common MT reading of the second term of the phrase in Ezek 28:12 is rPļpR Driver contends that the term is a misvocalization of rPJļiņ ("careful prepa- ration, perfection"). The LXX reading ópoícooic;, however, suggests rnnn ("pat- tern"). This reading is supported also by a marginal MT textual tradition, the Vg (, similitudo ), the Peshitta (dmwC), and Targum Pseudo- Jonathan (xmiX). rPJ^n, derived from ¡"133 ("to build") with the preformative n, most probably denoted orig- inally an architectural plan (cf. Exod 25:9, 40; Josh 22:28; 2 Kgs 16:10). This archaic meaning placed it in semantic proximity to "likeness," niBT, as the MT version of 2 Kgs 16:10 suggests.25 In Hos 13:2 it denotes divine images, as Tar- gum Pseudo-Jonathan interprets it in Ezek 28:12. In several exilic and postexilic texts it derives the meaning of pattern or form, often in specific connection to divine images. In Deut 4:16-18, rPJDD is the form (nJIBfi) of a *70D. According to Isa 44: 13, a divine image bears the human rP33n. In Ps 106:20 it is contended that idolaters "exchange the TOD of Yhwh for the rPJDJl of a bull." A similar iconic meaning is attested in Ezekiel. In Ezek 8: 10 rpion denotes the zoomorphic painted images of the First Temple.26 In Ezek 8:3 and 10:8 the hand of the TDD is pre- cisely the rPJ^n (LXX ópoítopa; Peshitta dmwP) of a hand, language reminiscent of the depiction of the TOD as a mö7 in Ezek 1 :26, 28. Its iconic connotation makes mnn a more likely agentive noun of a passive participle of Dnn. rnsn of the MT would easily be a graphic misreading of rnnn, given the fact that other readings of 2 as D are attested in the MT.27 d'Agent," 420-21. For the extensive phenomenon of modernization of archaic expressions, see McCarter, Textual Criticism, 5 1 -56. 24 Moreover, even a plene spelling of the regular type qätül could have been subjected to a metathesis of waw prompted by a similar quest for clarity and meaning. See the succinct discussion of this phenomenon in McCarter, Textual Criticism, 50-5 1 . Several scholars have also postulated the existence in Hebrew of an ancient passive qal participle of the type qutal, to which they have attrib- uted several forms that appear to be in pual (e.g., *73$ of Exod 3:2; 73$ of Isa 53:4; see Joiion and Muraoka, Grammar, 167-68). The practice of spelling these supposed qutal participial forms in scriptio plena is attested in MT Judg 13:8, 7*?:P (for 7^. This type of ancient passive participle is attested also in a constructive state with a genitivus auctoris in Isa 53:4 (the LXX translators avoid the construction, which was probably viewed as either ambiguous or awkward). Its plene form is identical and prone to be confused with the plene spelling of an active qal participle. 25 Several Qumranic fragments also attest to the semantic proximity between 71*3371 and 711B7. 4Q403 1 ii. 3 refers to 7133 71*3371 ,IC1Ö, probably an allusion to the depiction of the 7133 in Ezek 1 :28 as mrr 7133 711Ö7 nano. 1Q33 IO. 14 refers to D7X 71*3371. 26 The NRSV translates 71*3371 *73 as "all kinds," considering 71*3371 to be a generic term with- out an explicit iconic connotation. The phrase is in evident parallelism with ,l71*7} *73. It should rather be translated as "forms" or "images." The LXX omits the whole phrase. 27 See McCarter, Textual Criticism, 44. Callender (Adam in Myth and History, 92) deduces the meaning of "likeness" without even attempting to substitute 71*3371 for 71*3311. He contends: "'pattern,'</page><page sequence="8">YHWH'S CULTIC STATUE AFTER 597/586 B.C.E. 229 In conclusion, Ezek 28:12 should most probably be read as rpļļfl Dfiq, "imprinted of (by) the pattern." The reading of the original passive participle as an active form in the MT could have originated in its morphological ambiguity and archaic constructive position. The reading of the LXX readily translates the uncom- mon Hebrew construction, although it renders the passive participle with a noun.28 II. Ideological Context: Divine Presence and Absence after 597/586 B.c.E. Driver did not attach a meaning to his proposal for the original text of Ezek 28: 12 and subsequent scholarship has not yet reached a consensus in this regard; explanations for the comparison of the king of Tyre/Adam to a "signet of perfec- tion" range from rhetorical question, to deputyship, to perfection of design.29 The investigation of the histories of onn and rPinn, however, evinces the fact that both terms have iconic connotations. These connotations require further investigation in regard to the extent to which Ezek 28: 1 2 might employ the vocabulary of ongo- ing iconic concerns and speculations. Biblical scholars have increasingly acknowledged that monarchic Israel and Judah were not aniconic. Although current opinion still favors the concept of "empty space aniconism," it allows more and more for the probability that ancient Judah was not devoid of cultic images and that it worshiped a cultic statue of Yhwh in the First Temple.30 The existence of such a statue could have only exacerbated 'model,' 'regulate,' 'measure,' and 'estimate' [meanings he finds for msn] are words within the semantic sphere of conformance to an ideal." See also idem, "Primal Human," 187-88. 28 The interpretative life of the passage evinces similar readings in Christian and Jewish antiq- uity. Greenberg {Ezekiel, 2.581) notes that a tannaitic wedding blessing mentions the fashioning of Adam "in His [God's] image, likeness, and pattern" (irPJDn nittl Ū^ĪD). He also remarks that an iconic reading of Ezek 28:12 is witnessed in the sixteenth-century interpretation of Abarbanel. In Pseudo-Clementine Homilies 16.19, written sometime at the beginning of the third century C.E., the human body (acopa) is defined as "imprinted with the greatest seal" (acppayîôi pEylaTq ôia- TETUTUopévov), an impression by which it acquires "the form of god" (0eoū popcprļ). God's body functions like a seal (acppayic;) impressed on the human body. Humanity is God's eìkióv, or imprint. It is further emphasized, in vocabulary and ideology reminiscent of Ezekiel, that there is a funda- mental quality-of-life distinction between "the seal" (acppayic;) or "he who seals" (ó acppayiaac;), who is God, and "the sealed body" (tò acppayiaOèv acopa) or "that which is sealed" (tò acppayiaOèv), which is the human corporeality. David H. Aaron ("Shedding Light on God's Body in Rabbinic Midrashim: Reflections on the Theory of a Luminous Adam," HTR 90 [1997] 299-314, here 309- 10) notes the connection of this text with the rabbinic tradition attested in Eccl. Rab. 8:2, which develops a speculation about the luminosity of Adam based on Ezek 28: 12. 29 For an interpretation of the phrase as a rhetorical question, see Leslie C. Allen, Ezekiel (2 vols.; WBC 28, 29; Dallas: Word, 1990, 1994) 2. 92. For deputyship, see Block, Ezekiel, 2. 104.

The destruction of the temple and its statue was not only a major political and military catastrophe but also an ideological cataclysm. The throne and the statue of Yhwh could not have survived the aggression.31 This marked the end not sim- ply of a religious symbol, but the end of the earthly abode of Yhwh. Judah was forced to reassess its ideology of divine presence/absence.32 The preexilic divine presence/absence ideology was therefore revised and adapted to the new socio- political reality.33 Textual testimonies reflect a shift in the Judahite definition of the temple, a shift often applied retroactively to preexilic documents.

Mettinger, No Graven Image? Israelite Aniconism in Its Ancient Near Eastern Context (ConBOT 42; Stockholm: Alm- qvist &amp; Wiksell, 1995). 31 Niehr ("YHWH's Cult Statue," 91) suggests that the destruction of the cultic image may be reflected in the report of 2 Kgs 24:13 about the stripping (f2fp) of the cultic objects in the temple. This would imply, if one relies on the chronology of the account, that the destruction of the image occurred in 597 b.c.e., at the end of Jehoiachin's reign. Tryggve N. D. Mettinger {The Dethronement of Sabaoth: Studies in the Shem and Kabod Theologies [ConBOT 18; Lund: Gleerup, 1982] 61) also notes that the biblical account seems to suggest that "the throne was stripped of its gold plate already in 597." Psalm 74:6-7, which mentions the breaking of the "carved work" (mnD) and the burning of the sanctuary, might also allude to this disastrous event. 32 For the issue of the presence/absence of Yhwh, central to exilic and postexilic ideologies, see especially Joseph Blenkinsopp, History and Prophecy in Ancient Israel (Philadelphia: West- minster, 1983) 197; Gary A. Anderson, Sacrifices and Offerings in Ancient Israel: Studies in Their Social and Political Importance (HSM 41; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1987) 93; Kutsko, Between Heaven and Earth. 33 The probability that the ideology centered in the presence of Yhwh in a cultic statue survived the events of 597/585 b.c.e. is supported by textual evidence, such as Ps 1 15:2-8; Ezek 20:32; Isa 40:18-19 (= Isa 46:5-6); 42:8-9; Jer 2:26-27; 10:14-16.</page><page sequence="10">YHWH'S CULTIC STATUE AFTER 597/586 B.C.E. 23 1 52: 17-23), opposes an ideology that depicts the deity as physically enthroned in the temple (Jer 3:16-17; 23:24). In the Book of Jeremiah, the abode of Yhwh is re- located from the temple, no longer extant, to an increasingly reclusive heaven. Heaven, identified in preexilic mentalities with the temple, is itself secluded to accommodate the new transcendent deity.34 Similarly for Deutero-Isaiah and Trito- Isaiah, heaven, equally reclusive, is Yhwh's habitation (e.g., Isa 63:15; 66:1). The only immanent side of the divinity is the divine voice (e.g., Isa 40:25). Yhwh's heavenly abode becomes a place of hiding (e.g., Isa 45: 15). Biblical scholars have noted in the past that two main emerging ideologies reassess the preexilic theology concerning the physical presence of Yhwh in the temple, in his statue, and introduce two important new concepts, ÜVÍ and TOD.35 Both ideologies avoid one of the main titles of Yhwh in the First Temple, mrP míQX, a title impregnated with iconic connotations and most proba- bly associated specifically with Yhwh's statue.36 The Deuteronomistic circles substitute a U' Ü theology for the preexilic ideol- ogy that was no longer viable.37 The place of worship becomes a dwelling only for the ultimately unconfined and immaterial name of God (e.g., 1 Kgs 8:16-20, 29, 44, 48; 2 Sam 7: 13). 38 Moshe Weinfeld, one of the main analysts of the ideol- 34 In preexilic ideologies the temple and heaven share a unique identity. With Yhwh dwelling literally in the temple, the temple is heaven (cf. Ps 14:2, 7; 20:3, 7; 76:3, 9). See also Tryggve N. D.

A heaven distinct from the temple does not become Yhwh's habitation until exilic and postexilic times, when the temple and its statue are no longer extant.

Mettinger dates the emergence of the DW theology to 597, when he places the destruction of the cherubim throne {Dethronement of Sabaoth, 38 n. 1, and esp. 59-66). 38 This is also the opinion of Gerhard von Rad {Studies in Deuteronomy [London: SCM, 1953] 38-39), Moshe Weinfeld {Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1972] 193), George Ernest Wright ("The Temple in Palestine-Syria," BAR 1 [1961] 169-84,</page><page sequence="11">232 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 69,2007 ogy, summarizes: "The deuteronomic school used this phraseology in a very con- sistent manner and never made the slightest digression from it. There is not one example in the deuteronomic literature of God dwelling in the temple or the build- ing of a house for God. The temple is always the dwelling of his name, and the house was built for his name ."39 For the Deuteronomic circles God dwells physi- cally in the secluded heaven (1 Kgs 8:27-49; Deut 26:15; 33:26). Yhwh's pres- ence on earth is exclusively mediated through his name. The Sinai event is revised and purged of any reference to the form or bodily appearance of Yhwh (Deut 4: 12). Yhwh spoke from heaven and not from the top of the mountain, and the contact with Yhwh was not visual but auditory (cf. Deut 4:12, 32, 36; 5:4, 22-23). The alternative TÜ3 theology of the priestly circles exhibits the same marks of an ideological revision based on the events of 597/586 b.c.e. as the Deuteron- omistic ideology. In contrast to the ideology of the Deuteronomistic circles, which centered on the divine DIZ/, the Priestly source does not remove Yhwh completely from his abode. It instead proposes a presence of Yhwh in his TOD, a mobile pres- ence, yet physical or concrete.40 The divine T133, as opposed to □$, still possesses and reflects the concreteness of the presence of Yhwh in the temple, although it adds to it more mobility. The TDD, in the concrete form of fire enveloped by cloud, dwells in the tabernacle (see Exod 13:21-22; 14:24; 24:16-17; 40:34-38; Num 9:15) and the First Temple (see 1 Kgs 8:10-1 1, which exhibits priestly traits). Modern scholarship has long noted affinities between the Book of Ezekiel and the ideology of the Priestly sources.41 In the Book of Ezekiel, as well as in the Priestly source, Yhwh's presence in the sacred space (temple/tabernacle) is mate- rialized in the TOD. Although Ezekiel's depiction of the 7133 retains the central features of its depictions in the Priestly source, namely, fire and cloud (see 1 :4, 27-28), it also attributes to the divine presence an evident anthropomorphism (1:1- 3:15; 8:1-11:25). Moreover, Ezekiel reintroduces into the exilic revisionist ide- ologies the concept of the throne upon which the divine presence is seated (chaps. 1 ; 10).42 The throne of Yhwh becomes the throne of the TOD (cf. the expression NOD TOD in Jer 17:12). here 181), Ronald E.

The concept was being widely used in refer- ence to the numinous character of the cultic statues of gods. Psalm 63:3 refers to beholding Yhwh's TDD in a manner that recalls the language of seeing Yhwh in the temple setting, language that bears evident iconic connotations.43 In Ps 106:20 Yhwh's TOD stands in contrast to idols. 7123 apparently refers to the numinous essence of divine cultic statues (see also Isa 42:8; 48:11; Jer 2:11). The meaning is further supported by the connection between 7133 and the Mesopotamian con- cepts puluhtu, rašubbatu, namurratu, and melammu 44 These terms indicate divine (and royal) majesty and luminosity as concretely envisioned in the cultic statues of the gods, predominantly in their crowns and garments. Scholars have also long noted a correspondence between the iconic 7133 of Ezekiel and the protoplast of the Priestly source. Adam is defined in the Priestly source in terms reminiscent of the iconic function of the 7123 in Ezekiel. First, the Priestly source defines Adam's special connection to the deity by means of and niö7 (Gen 1 :26), terms generally used to denote statues of gods (e.g., Num 33:52; 1 Sam 6:5; 2 Kgs 11:18; Ezek 7:20; 16:17; 23:24; Amos 5:26; see also Isa 40:18- 19a and 46:5-6).45 Numerous scholars have thus concluded that the priestly ideol- ogy treats Adam as the equivalent of a pagan cult statue or idol.46 To the question of Isa 40:18-19, the priestly ideology answered "Adam." 43 Niehr ("YHWH's Cult Statue," 83-85) notes that the most plausible meaning of the expres- sion of "seeing Yhwh" within the temple is in reference to a cultic image. The Israelite language of "seeing Yhwh" corresponds to the ancient Near Eastern conception that to see a god means to behold the divine image. C. L. Seow ("Face," DDD, 2nd ed., 322-24, here 323) notes that "the Akkadian idiom 'to see the face (of the deity)' probably had its origin in the confrontation of the cult image in the sanctuary; those who went to the temple literally 'saw' a representation of the deity." Several texts suggest a similar conception among ancient Israelites. In Ps 1 1 :7 the righteous are promised visions of Yhwh's □'3D. In Ps 42:3 the pilgrimage to the temple ultimately aspires to visions of Yhwh's □"'JD. Psalm 17:15 explicitly correlates the vision of the divine ETJD with seeing the "form" (rman) of Yhwh, a word choice highly suggestive, given the physical connotation of nnftn and its association with cultic images (e.g., Exod 20:4; Deut 4: 16, 23, 25; 5:8). 44 See also CAD M/2 9-12; A.

Within its ideological parame- ters, the creation and the structure of the world mirror the construction and the function of the temple.47 According to this creation/temple parallelism, Adam, who is introduced at the culmination of the creation in the world's innermost and most sacrosanct space (Eden), corresponds to the preexilic statue of Yhwh, which would have been placed in the innermost and most sacred chamber of the temple, the holy of holies, in an act that would have signified the completion of the temple. In the Priestly source, Adam functions as the representation of Yhwh, or the physi- cal replacement of the statue no longer extant. Third, Adam's depiction as the rhx and m&amp;7 (LXX eìkcóv and ópoícoaiç) of Yhwh in Gen 1 :26 closely corresponds to the description of the divine TDD as m?D7 □7N HÍCIftD (LXX ó|ioíü)|ia (bç eîôoç àv0pámou) in Ezek 1 :26-28. Gerhard von Rad has defined the expression in Ezek 1 :26 as "the prelude to Gen 1 :26."48 As Mark S. Smith notes, "whereas Ez 1,26 conveys the prophet's vision of God in the likeness of the human person, the P writer's vision of the human person is in the likeness of God."49 John F. Kutsko further argues that "fundamentally P and Ezekiel are deal- ing with the same answer, approached from different angles: man is like God, God is like man. In this answer both P and Ezekiel remove other gods from the equa- tion."50 In the priestly ideology that stands behind both the Priestly source and 1983) 84-96; A.

The priestly ideol- ogy proposes a prolongation of the numinous value of the cultic statue of Yhwh in the concept of TOD.51 The TDD, however, is mobile and escapes constant human access; it does not function fully (or socially, liturgically) like a statue. Neverthe- less, it is not imageless. Both P and Ezekiel remain ultimately dedicated to an ide- ology that is strictly monotheistic but not aniconic. In both P and Ezekiel, humanity (see Gen 5:1-2) functions as the image of Yhwh, as the continuation of the cultic statue of Yhwh in the First Temple. The proposed reconstruction of Ezek 28:12, rPJļfl Qiin/aTToocppaYiapa ó|ioiá)aeu)c;, a depiction of a royal figure associated with primeval humanity, coin- cides with these ongoing speculations about the iconic function of Adamic human- ity (Gen 1 :26 and Ezek 1 :28). The textual traditions of the LXX, the Peshitta, and the Vg read Ezek 28: 12 in this context. The preference of the LXX translator(s) to render rPJDIl with opoicoau; is peculiar and meaningful. Other words would have constituted better candidates and were commonly employed in translations of rnnn: 7iapctÔ£iy[ia in Exod 25:9; 1 Chr 28:11-12, 18-19; Timoç in Exod 25:40; ópoíaipa in Deut 4:16-18; 2 Kgs 16:10; Ps 144:12; Josh 22:28; popcpr] in Isa 44: 13. The peculiar choice for ópoítoaiç reflects an association between rpļļfl DJIfJ and the ideology behind Gen 1 :26, in which humanity's iconic value is expressed by means of ópoíüjou;.52 The same association is evident in the Peshitta, which translates mnn with dmwt3, and in the Vg, which opts for similitudo. The association seems to have been mediated by the semantic proximity of rPJDn to m&amp;7 (e.g., 2 Kgs 16:20). III.

Crowns are commonly associated with divine statues and the divine TDD. Weinfeld notes that "in the ancient Near East the divine glory was embodied in the crown of the deity or hero; this holds true of Heb. kâbôd as well."55 Weinfeld's ref- erences are Job 19:9 ("he has stripped me from my TOD and taken the crown from my head") and Ps 8:6 ("You have made him a little less than God, and crowned him with TDD and honor"). Psalm 8:6 is particularly relevant, as it refers to primeval humanity. It must further be recalled that TQD also refers to the divine majesty of the cultic statues of gods (see Ps 106:20; Isa 42:8; 48: 1 1 ; Jer 2: 1 1). Crowns are cen- tral paraphernalia of the cultic statues of ancient Near Eastern gods. The mention of beauty ("'D'') further supports the association of the phrase with the statue of Yhwh. derived from nD1 ("to be beautiful") refers to physi- cal appearance, as the common association of the root with "INfl and HîOft evinces.56 Therefore, the depiction in Ps 50:2 of Zion, from which Yhwh shines forth (yo*'), as ^ ("the perfection of beauty," but cf. the LXX r] eimpeTieia Tfjç cbpaiótrjToc; [Ps 49:2]) could hardly have referred to anything other than Yhwh's cultic statue.57 The divine beauty was specifically embodied in divine images. Lamentations 2:15 also employs W as a title of Zion. The LXX associates the phrase with 713D and translates (rréqxxvoç ôóÇr|c;. Ezekiel 16:14 explains Jerusalem's perfection (^D) in beauty OST) as the presence of Yhwh's splendor (lin). Both Ezek 16: 14 and Ps 50:2 associate Zion's beauty with the radiant pres- ence of Yhwh in the temple. The deity that shines forth is the one CTiron In 1985, Oswald Loretz argued in a monograph dedicated to the Canaanite back- ground of Psalm 27 that the expression "to behold the fairness of Yhwh and inquire in his palace" in Ps 27:4 most probably refers to the vision and the worship of Yhwh's cultic statue.58 Psalm 80: 1-3 associates the shining of Yhwh from the tem- ple with the deity's face (D^D). Therefore, the expression W seems to be rooted in the preexilic termi- nology associated with the divine statue. The transfer of the title to Zion and Jerusalem could very well be an exilic manner of dealing with the destruction of 54 Driver, "Ezekiel," 159. 55 Weinfeld, "TOD," 27, 29. 56 See Helmer Ringgren, "HD1," TDOT, 6. 218-20, here 218-19.

A precedent for this transfer is the Mesopotamian concept that the splendor of divine images is reflected in their entire cities.59 The use of the phrase ^ in Ezek 28: 12 in reference to the king of Tyre/Adam reflects a transfer of the iconic presence of Yhwh, of Yhwh's "radi- ant beauty," to primordial humanity.

My iconic reading, however, diverges from theirs. For the radiant crowns of deities, see, e.g., Erra I 127-28. The connection between the Book of Ezekiel and the Poem of Erra has been evinced extensively in modern scholarship (see especially the thorough analysis of Daniel Bodi, The Book of Ezekiel and the Poem of Erra [OBO 104; Freiburg: Universitätsverlag; Göttin- gen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1991]). In Erra I 127-28 Erra persuades Marduk to leave his tem- ple in Babylon. The text mentions in this context that Marduk's statue is in disrepair, and that his "crown, which used to light up Ehalanki like Etemenanki, is dimmed" (trans, from Bodi, Ezekiel, 192). In Enuma Elish IV 58 Marduk's melammu literally "crowns" his head. For the association of crowns with melammu, see also Enuma Elish I 67-68. 61 For interpretative issues concerning ļriDOE, see Block, Ezekiel, 2. 106 n. 96; H.

It is possible that the list of precious stones attests to further associations between pri- mordial humanity and divine statues. The list of precious stones adorning Adam's garment is admit- tedly reminiscent of the stones on the high priest's breastpiece (Exod 28:17-20; 39:10-13), but the high priest's vestments could also be expected to reflect some of the majesty of the garments of Yhwh, garments adorning Yhwh's cultic statue. The patterning of the high priest's garments after Yhwh's appears in rabbinic traditions (e.g., Exod. Rah. 38:8).</page><page sequence="17">238 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 69, 2007 clothes or garments in Isa 23: 1 8; 2 Sam 17:19; and possibly Ezek 21:1. 62 The root also produces the name of the screen of the door of the tabernacle, namely, "|0ÏÏ, which is a needlework made of linen (see Exod 26:36; 27:16; 35:15, 17; 36:37; 39:38; 40:5, 8, 28; see also Isa 22:8).63 There is an evident connection between "irODft ¡TV px and roíòft DHTl T^n.64 a derivative of HD10Ö, describes generically crafting in gold, or, as Block defines it, "the special craftsmanship of a goldsmith."65 Tön most probably derives from ,D' 6 6 Therefore, the phrases "|rüOö mp*» pN and Tön riDíÒD DHTl should most probably be read as "every precious stone was your covering/gar- ment" and "gold was the craftsmanship of your beauty," a depiction of Adam as a statue of presumably wooden core overlaid with gold sheets and dressed with gar- ments adorned with precious stones.67 This meaning coincides with the subsequent phrase, "p Töpn. CTöpl most probably derives from 2p3 and refers to perforations (as the V g foramina interprets), which in this case could denote perforations made in the core of divine statues for the attachment of the gold sheets.68 The king/Adam is further associated with a cherub in Ezek 28: 14. Once again the LXX preserves a variant quite different from the MT. The MT reads DTO JIN, "you are a cherub," a variant that is considered in the prevailing consensus to be a better reflection of the original reading.69 T'H could be a defective form of the masculine pronoun nnx, and it occurs as such in Num 11:15 and Deut 5:24. The Targum of Ezekiel corrects the form to nnK. The Vg adheres to this reading and 62 Block, Ezekiel, 2.106 n. 96. 63 Moreover, the term presents an interesting double entendre. It is also in the semantic range of *103, a by-form of 1DD (on 103, see C. Dohmen, "103," TDOT, 9. 455-60; idem, "HD0Ö," TDOT, 8. 431-37; Berlejung, Die Theologie der Bilder, 306-7). The verb produces TDOft, which refers to metal plating and often to statues of gods crafted in this manner (Dohmen, "103," 456-57; idem, "TD00," 43 1-32). Moreover, H000 is often directly associated with OHT (Dohmen, "HODO," 434, 436). 64 The phrase "pon riDfrÒO OTITI is of special difficulty. According to the masoretic punctuation, OHT concludes the list of gemstones. The LXX and the Peshitta connect the term to the subsequent phrase. This is most probably accurate, given the fact that gold is not a gemstone. 65 Block, Ezekiel, 2.109. TDÍÒO is extensively used in narratives about the tabernacle and the temple, in reference to their crafting (Exod 3 1:3, 5; 35:29-35; 38:24; 39:43; 1 Kgs 7:14; 1 Chr 22:15; 28:21; 29:5). 66 See Block, Ezekiel, 2. 100, 109-10, also 100 n. 52.

The LXX has fiyayév as tò xePol)ß- In light of the proba- bility that the text associates Adam with Yhwh's cultic statue, the protoplast's iden- tification with a cherub is implausible. The attributes of the cherub in the MT, "pion further suggest that the cherub is not identified with Adam but rather is associated with Adam in the protoplast's role as the statue of Yhwh. Theomor- phic humanity would be appropriately placed in the temple with the cherubim. I noted above that, within the framework of the priestly parallelism between the temple and the world, Eden corresponds to the holy of holies. Modern scholars have also noted that in Ezek 28: 1 1-19 Eden reflects the sanctuary of Jerusalem.70 In Ezek 28:16 the king/Adam resides among "stones of fire" (ttfX ^2X), a phrase that recalls the "stones" of fire - that is, the blazing coals of the altar from among the cherubim (cf. $X ^ru, Ezek 1:13; 10:2, 6-7; also Ps 18:13, 16/2 Sam 22:13; Lev 16:12).71 Through his incorporation of iconic terminology and imagery, Ezekiel con- veys in a succinct, poetic manner an important anthropological statement. Ezekiel 28:1-19 (as well as the other oracles of 28:20-32:32) addresses a humanity that claims divinity,72 according to a dominant monarchical ideology in the ancient Near East.73 In w. 2 and 9, the king of Tyre purports to be a "god" ( and DTÒX/Oeóç); subsequent swift divine correction reminds the king that he is but a human being (□iX/avOpíOTtoç). The corrective completes Ezekiel's iconic anthro- pology. Modern commentators have observed that the exilic concept of humanity as representation of the divine, as the and fflöi of Yhwh (Gen 1 :26), was most probably influenced by ancient Near Eastern ideologies regarding the function of royalty as imaging the divine.74 Within these ideologies iconic language served to 70Callender, Adam in Myth and History, 41; Yaron, "Dirge over the King of Tyre," 40-41; Launderville, "Ezekiel's Cherub," 175; Wilson, "Death of the King of Tyre," 215. 71 For this interpretation of the "stones of fire," see also Launderville, "Ezekiel's Cherub," 173, 179; Yaron, "Dirge over the King of Tyre," 38-40; Wilson, "Death of the King of Tyre," 216. 72 It is possible that Ezek 28:1-19 contains two units originally distinct and conjoined edito- rially, namely, w. 1-10 and 11-19. It has been contended that form and topic differentiate the two units (see the discussion in Wilson, "Death of the King of Tyre," 211-12). Nevertheless, in their final form the two units coalesce in a unitary composition. The whole of w. 1-19 has the same addressee (the king of Tyre), the same general theme, and the same vocabulary. 73 Most probably the direct referent of Ezekiel's oracles is the Egyptian monarchical ideology (Launderville, "Ezekiel's Cherub," 170). 74 For these influences, see H. Wildberger, "Das Abbild Gottes Gen 1:26-30," TZ 21 (1965) 245-59, 481-501; Edward M.

Ezekiel employs iconic language to define an iconism of likeness but not of identity and an anthropology of theomorphism but not of full equality with the divine. For Ezekiel, humanity is the image of Yhwh. Nevertheless, humanity is not fully divine. Adam is a divine statue, but no god. Yhwh's new statue is not Yhwh himself. The human/divine distinction is conveyed by means of a language of similar iconic connotations. The punishment of the king of Tyre reflects the destruction of divine images.75 His violent death is depicted as the slaying76 of his radiance (nysVxò kúXXoc;) (Ezek 28:7), which can hardly connote anything except the destruction of the king's divine resemblance. In v. 16 the king is removed from his abode "from among the stones of fire" (WN TIDE), that is, from the holy of holies. In v. 17 he is cast to the ground (ļ^ttf) and exposed (ļri3) before scorning eyes. In v. 18 he is consumed (n^D) by fire and turned into ashes (""IDÍÒ) on the ground. Extant accounts from the ancient Near East of the destruction of captured divine images are admittedly scarce.77 In the Hebrew Bible, the process is more or less homogenized and often referred to as killing a divine resemblance (cf. Isa 37:19 = 2 Kgs 19:18) and it most often entails casting to the ground (see 1 Sam 5:3), smashing (see Exod 23:24; Lev 26:30; Deut 7:5; 12:3; 1 Sam 5:4;78 1 Kgs 15:13; 2 Kgs 23:12; Isa 21:9; Mie 1:7), 79 and the burning and scattering of the ashes of the divine images (cf. 2 Kgs 23:6, 11; Exod 32:20; Deut 7:5; 12:3; 1 Kgs 15:13; Mie 1:7; Isa 37:19 = 2 Kgs 19:18). 80 The mutilation and destruction of the resemblance and of the divine paraphernalia of statues were perceived as the end of their numinous character, of the presence of the gods within them. The punish- ment of the king of Tyre recalls this practice. Ezekiel 6:3-6 describes a similar treatment of the idolatrous Israel, who also functions in Ezekiel as a divine image.81 Israel is slain with a sword (vv. 3-4), his bones exposed and scattered on the ground (v. 4), his idols broken and smashed (v. 6). 75 See also the observations in Block, Ezekiel, 2. 98, 117; Launderville, "Ezekiel's Cherub," 173-74. 76 In v. 7 the MT vocalizes bbn as "to desecrate." The LXX (oTpcoaouaiv dq à7TU)'Eiav), Tar- gum Pseudo-Jonathan ("injure"), and the Peshitta ("kill") suggest that the original contained bbnm ("you were slain"), which coincides with the reference in vv. 9-10 to the death (mo) of the king of Tyre. In v. 1 6, however, the original seems to have been bbn, "to desecrate." 77 See especially Th. Baran, "Leben und Tod der Bilder," in Ad bene et ßdeliter seminandum: Festgabe für Karlheinz Deller zum 21. Februar 1987 (ed. G. Mauer and U.

Brandes, "Destruction et mutilation de statues en Mésopotamie," Akkadica 16 (1980) 28-41. 78 For the probable allusion to this motif in 1 Sam 5:3-4, see W.

Conclusions The congruence between the MT and LXX versions of Ezek 28:12 and sev- eral considerations of translation suggest that àTTOocppáyiajia ópoitbaecoc; renders not a nominal construction but a passive participle and a noun in genitivus auctoris, namely, rPļSfl DflD, "imprinted of (by) the pattern." The cumulative evidence leads to the tentative conclusion that Ezekiel 28 constructs a new iconism and a redefined anthropology, within which primeval humanity is defined as imprinted with the form of Yhwh and functioning as Yhwh's statue. The ideological purpose that emerges from Ezekiel is the redefinition (within the novel exilic context) of the legitimate and illegitimate fusions of the divine and the human, a concern most probably due to Ezekiel's priestly background.82 Ezekiel deconstructs the com- mon ancient Near Eastern conception of the monarch as theomorphic and isotheic (that is, equal to God) and, employing its vestigial expressions, redefines human- ity instead as theomorphic, but also introduces a major qualification: humanity is not isotheic. In an evident polemical engagement, Ezekiel chooses an ancient Near Eastern king to exemplify his point. Most probably owing to exilic polemics regarding idols and the resulting intrinsic redefinition of divine statues, for Ezekiel, Yhwh's new statue ceases to be Yhwh himself or to be a fully divine being. Although the statue possesses divine form and iconic value, the quality of life attached to it is not divine. Adam is there- fore not the complete equivalent of a divine statue. In a period when divine stat- ues/"idols" cease themselves to be conceived as numinous, Yhwh's statue is emphatically destroyed for claiming divinity. In Ezekiel's anti-idolatry iconism and theomorphic anthropology, Adam is not Yhwh in the way that idols are con- ceived as actual gods, real incarnations of their subjects. Nevertheless, Adam pos- sesses an idol's theomorphism and cultic function. Placed by Ezekiel in the holy of holies, where the preexilic statue of Yhwh stood, the iconic humanity retains the statue's resemblance to Yhwh and its cultic function. It becomes the (only) legiti- mate channel for the iconic worship of Yhwh. It bears the bodily image of Yhwh and is ultimately meant to direct to and to serve Yhwh. Adam's claim to constitute the ultimate object of worship, independently from Yhwh, is appropriately repri- manded with the destruction of its divine resemblance and iconicity. This theomorphic and iconic anthropology converges with the message of the reconstructed myths of creation in the priestly agenda, which subtly bestows on humanity in Genesis 1 divine form and iconic function and refuses it divine ontol- ogy throughout the rest of Genesis 2-1 1 (see also Num 23: 19). 82 For the priestly character of this concern, see Launderville, "Ezekiel's Cherub," 172-75; Jacob Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16: A new translation with introduction and commentary (AB 3; New York: Doubleday, 1991) 256-61; David P. Wright, "Unclean and Clean (Old Testament)," ABD, 6. 739-40.</page></plain_text>
