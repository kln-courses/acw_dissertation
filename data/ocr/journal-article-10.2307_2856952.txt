<plain_text><page sequence="1">Renaissance Problems in Calvin's Theology1 PROFESSOR RoY W. BArrENHOUSE has recently presented us with a most stimulating and perceptive essay on "The Doctrine of Man in Calvin and in Renaissance Platonism."2 In it he argued that the gen- eral mode of Calvin's thought about the states of man innocent, fallen, and saved- conformed to the pattern of Renaissance neo- platonist ideas of the different levels of human existence. Although the speciEc conclusions and content of Calvin's thinking (e.g., pre- destination and the denial of free will) were on their face dia- metrically opposed to those of Pico della Mirandola and Ficino, Calvin's rejection of humanism for theology, and of reason for revelation, seems to have been a rejection more often of conclusions than of basic definitions and assumptions.... Calvin's doctrine of man may have a subterranean dependence on the very Renaissance optimism and rationalism which Calvin sought to reprove and chasten.3 Although there may be certain emphases in Professor Battenhouse's arguments that might well be supplemented, the present paper is essentially an independent and parallel consideration of some of the concerns that Calvin shared witla Renaissance writers, including some humanists. Its focus is on the way in which Calvin dealt with certain general problems of the relation of man and his world rather than on the extent to which he was or was not neoplatonic, stoic, humanist, or scholastic to all of which schools he was in some ways indebted and from which he in other ways decisively differed. The key question in the history of Christian ethics has been the relation of value to reality. To what extent could the Golden Rule, the injunction to "love thy neighbor as thyself," be realized, human nature being whatever it happened to be thought to be and the world what- ever way it was conceived? Calvin's thinking on this question took place after two centuries of particularly agitated concern with the problem, and it was his conviction that through his theology he had resolved the moral crisis it had presented. Some periods of time and some systems of Christian thought make rather bland assumptions about the ease with which a Christian can live according to his values. Not so the last two centuries of the Middle Ages. One of the Refor- mation's challenges to the authority of the Church was based on the 1 An early version of this paper was read before the New England Conference on RenaissanceStudies, atNorthampton, Mass., October 30-31, 1953. 2 Journal of the History of Ideas, IX ( 1948), 447-71. 3 Ibid., 469-70. Of course, the writings of Pico and Ficino might well be considered as much theological as humanist.</page><page sequence="2">60 RENAISSANCE PROBLEMS IN CALVIN S THEOLOGY fact that despite the voices of gloomy prophets, skeptical critics, and ardent proponents of reform the Church was committed as an in^ stitution to the premise that with its aid an individual could lead a Christian life, the consequence for many being either a resort to hypocrisy or descent to despair. With only a limited amount of exag- geration it could be said that Luther and Calvin in their separate ways sought to show how one could not lead a Christian life and still remain a Christian. Weber and Troelts.ch, among many others, have made this clear.4 Nevertheless, the immediate influence of each of the reformers was to stimulate a striking intensification of faith which had its counterpart in a reformed Catholicism. How was this accomplished? In Luther's case there was an ap^ parently simple separation of Christian faith from the unchristian works one was compelled to perform in the circumstances of the world. Without entering into his actually rather complicated position,5 it may be said for purposes of comparison that Luther airmed a sub- jective inner fulfillment of Christian values, coupled with a recognition of the objective necessity of conforming to the unchristian outward cirxmstances. Calvin also started with a separation of subjective and objective elements. His method, however, was to demonstrate that despite contemporary pessimism, the objective nature of the material world, society, and man really did manifest the hand and purpose of God, and that it was the subjective corruption and debility of human per- ception, consequential to the Fall, that made things seem perverse and uncertain. Men tended to overestimate their own righteousness, taking their seemingly good motives at their face value and exag- gerating their moral capacity because any notion that they were superior appealed to their vanity. Viewing aSairs according to their own distorted perceptions, men could never see the true purpose and hand of God in the world, and so they failed to appreciate his wisdom and goodness even in the manifestations of disaster and evil in natural and human events. 4Max Weber, The ProtestanD Ethic and the SpiriD of Capitalism, tr.

Cf., on the other hand, Reinhold Niebuhr's defense of Reformation theology against what he considered to be the falsely optimistic Medieval Catholic and Renaissance views of man, particularly his The Natwre and Destiny of Man (New York, 1941 and 1943). I have emphasized a contrary view to that of Niebuhr in ''The Problem of Free Will in the Renaissance and the Reforma- tion," Joxrnal of theHistory of Idevs, X (1949), 51-62. 5 For a more extended discussion see my essay, "The Religious Foundation of Luther's Social Views," in Records of Medieval Civilization, Texts and Stsdies in Honor of Austin Patterson Evans (New York: Columbia University Press, 1954).</page><page sequence="3">61 CHARLES TRINKAUS Calvin seems to conceive of the human defect in essentially per- ceptual terms: Because from our natural proneness to hypocrisy, any vain appearance of righteousness abundantly contents us instead of the reality; and everything within and around us being exceedingly defiled, we are delighted with what is least so, as extremely pure, while we confine our reflections within the limits of human corruption. So the eye, accustomed to see nothing but black, judges that to be very white, which is but whitish or perhaps brown. Indeed, the senses of our body may assist us in discovering how grossly we err in estimating the powers of the soul. For if at noon day we look either on the ground or at any surrounding objects, we conclude our vision to be very strong and piercing; but when we raise our eyes and steadily look at the sun, they are at once dazzled and confounded with such a blaze of brightness, and we are constrained to confess that our sight, so piercing in viewing terrestrial things, when directed to the sun, is dimness itself. Thus also it happens in consideration of our spiritual endowments.6 Professor Battenhouse has noted the similarity of passages such as this to Plato's myth of the cave.7 It might be said that while for Plato men sinned out of ignorance, for Calvin men nrere ignorant out of sin. Calvin, therefore, took it upon himself to show in the first book of the Institutes the objective evidence of the rationality and order of natlre and society which indicate their divine origin and accept- ability to man. At the same time he felt compelled to indicate all the idolatrous and anthropomorphic and magical distortions of reality introduced by men into their conception of it. In this respect he re- vealed a kinship, not only between his theology and the ancient Greek quest for an underlying rationality, but also with the new scientific 6 The present study is based on Calvin's final and definitive version of the Institxtio Christianae Religionis published in 1559.

Calvin's effort to eliminate religious sub- jectivism ran parallel to the later effort of Galileo to eliminate or control the subjective factors distorting the observation of natural phenomena by distinguishing between primary and secondary quali- ties and correcting for the error and bias of the observer. It is interesting that Calvin believed that in this way not God but the divine order might be discovered and that he rejected any tendency to identify God and nature, such as Spinoza was to formulate. I confess, indeed, that the expression nature is God, may be used in a pious sense by a pious mind; but it is harsh and inconsistent with strict propriety of speech, nature being rather an order prescribed by God; it is dangerous in matters so momentous, and demanding peculiar caution, to confound the Deity with the inferior course of his works.9 Is it too much to compare this attitude to the general positivism of the scientists concerning ultimate causality and their concentration on the discovery of phenomenal regularities and orders? At any rate there are many passages in this first book which seem to chastise men for failing to appreciate the grandeur of their world or even of their own natures, emphasizing, of course, that such a "Dis- covery of the World and of Man" should reflect glory on its Divine Maker and not on his miserable beneficiary. Of his wonderful wisdom, both heaven and earth contain innumerable proofs: not only those more abstruse things which are the subjects of astronomy, medi- cine, and the whole science of physics, but those which force themselves on the view of the most illiterate of mankind, so that they cannot open their eyes with- 8 Please note that I am not claiming any causal relationship between theology and science but am only suggesting that there was a parallel epistemological structure in them. In Calvin's case this was not merely a restatement of the classical idealist point of view. The latter (e.g., Plato) regarded the dualism between chaos and order as part of the metaphysical structure of the universe. Calvin on the other hand regarded the anarchic elements of both nature and human history as anarchic or chaotic only in ap- pearance, but in reality a part of a divinely determined order of events. His concern was epistemological. My impression is that this holds true of the early modern philosophy of science as well. However, Professor Robert K. Merton in his "Science and Technology in the Seventeenth Century," Osiris, IV (1938), 360-632, has attempted to demonstrate an intimate relationship between Calvinist ideas and scientific theories in seventeenth- century English scientists. 9"Fateor quidem pie hoc posse dici, modo a pio animo proficiscatur, naturam esse Deum; sed quia dura est et impropria loquutio quum potius natura sit ordo a Deo praescriptus, in rebus tanti ponderis, et quibus debetur singularis religio, involvere con- fuse Deum cum inferiore operum suorum cursu, noxium est"; I, v, 5.</page><page sequence="5">63 CHARLES TRINKAUS out being constrained to witness them. Adepts, indeed, in those liberal arts, or persons just initiated into them, are thereby enabled to proceed much further in investigating the secrets of the Divine Wisdom. Yet ignorance of those sciences prevents no man from such a survey of the workmanship of God, as is.more than sufficient to excite his admiration of the Divine Architect. In disquisitions concerning the motions of the stars, in fixing their situations, measuring their distances, and distinguishing their peculiar properties, there is need of skill, exactness and industry; and the providence of God being more clearly revealed in these discoveries, the mind ought to rise to a sublimer elevation for the con- templation of his glory. But since the meanest and most illiterate of mankind, who are furnished with no other assistance than their own eyes, cannot be ignorant of the excellence of the divine skill, exhibiting itself in that endless, yet regular variety of the innumerable celestial host it is evident that the Lord abundantly manifests his wisdom to every individual on earth. Thus it belongs to a man of pre-eminent ingenuity to examine with the critical exactness of Galen, the connection, the symmetry, the beauty and the use of the human body. But the composition of the human body is universally acknomrledged to be so ingenious, as to render its maker the object of deserved admiration. And there- fore some of the philosophers of antiquity have justly called man a microcosm, or world in miniature; because he is an eminent specimen of the pomrer, good- ness, and wisdom of God, and contains in him wonders enough to occupy the attention of our minds, if we are not indisposed to such a study.10 While a passage such as this can be regarded as similar in spirit to Book XXII, chap. 24 of St. Augustine's De Civitate Dei, or to Psalm 19 (to which Calvin makes reference in the preceding para- graph), there is also in it an element of special veneration of the more penetrating knowledge and appreciation of divine workman- 10"Mirificam eius sapientiam quae testentur, innumera sunt tum in coelo, tum in terris documenta: non illa modo reconditiora, quibus propius observandis astrologia, medicina, et tota physica scientia destinata est sed quae rudissimi cuiusque idiotae aspectui se ingerunt, ut aperiri oculi nequeant quin eorum cogantur esse testes. Equidem qui liberales illas artes vel imbiberunt, vel etiam degustarunt, earum subsidio adiuti longe altius provehuntur ad introspicienda divinae sapientiae arcana; nemo tamen earum inscitia impeditur quominus artificii satis superque pervideat in Dei operibus, unde in opificis admirationem prorumpat.

And while he, indeed, refers to sentiments expressed in the books of Job and Isaiah, there is a distinctive quality in his grandiose imaginatotl which visualizes God as an artist displaying his powers to a rapt human audience through the media of the elements. Thus he seems to have been in sympathy with the grandiloquent portrayal of the colo-ssal power of natural forces that was part of sixteenth-century artistic sensibility. The following passage is patently not that of a Shake- speare, nor adequately descriptive of a Leonardo drawing, but it has an aesthetic quality related to their fascination with meteorological powers. Noor orhat illustrious specimens of his power have we to arrest our attention ! unless it be possible for us not to know what strength is required to sustain with his word this immense fabric of heaven and earth; now by his mere nod to shake the heaven with roarinrg peals of thunder, to consume whatever he choose with lightnings, and set the atmosphere on fire with the flame; now to disturb it with tempests in various forms, and immediately, if he please, to com- pose it all to instantaneous serenity; to restrain, suspended as it were in air, the ses, which seems by its elevation, to threaten the earth with continual devasta- tion; now raising it in a tremendous manner, by the tumultuous violence of the winds, and now appeasing the waves to render it calm.ll In another passage Calvin bids man admire the handiwork of God in the beauty of the stellar order. Consider how great must have been the Artist who disposed the multitude of stars which adorn the heaven in such regular order that it is impossible to imagine anything more beautiful to behold; who fixed some in their stations so that they cannot be moved; who granted to others a freer course, but so that they never travel beyond their appointed limits; who so regulates the motions of all that they measure days and nights, months, years and seasons of the year, and also reduces the inequality of the days, which we constantly oritness, to such a medium that it occasions no confusion. So also, when we observe his power in 11"Iam potentia quam praeclaris speciminibus nos in considerationem sui rapit? nisi forte latere nos potest cuius sit virtutis, infinitam hanc coeli ac terrae molem suo verbo sustentare; solo nutu nunc fragore tonitruum coelum concutere, fulminibus quidlibet exurere, fulgetris aerem accendere; nunc variis tempestatum formis conturbare, eundem ipsum statim, ubi libuit, uno momento serenare- mare, quod assiduam terrae vastationem minari sua altitudine videtur, quasi in aere suspensum coercere; et nunc horrendum in modum tumultuoso ventorum impetu concitare, nuc sedatis undis, pacatum reddere", I, v, 6. Calvin's French prose style has long been admired, but he was equally a master of a Latin style whose flavor Allen most ably captures in his translation. However much he may have been inspired by acknowledged Biblical models, this language is his own, and the imaginative quality is sixteenth century in its emphasis on a single purpose behind the shifting manifestations of meteorological power.</page><page sequence="7">65 CHARLES TRINKAUS sustaining so great a mass7 in governing the rapid revoIutions of the ceIestial machine, and the like.l2 While Calvin could stand in wonder at the power and beauty of the universe, he was primarily a theologian and a moralist, and he never lost sight of his major scheme of inducing men to submit them- selves to the Divine Purpose rather than their own. And all these passages were intended to show that behind the disorderly appearance of natural and human events there lies a reality of order on a scale that is incomprehensible from the puny perspective of man. For example: When thick cIouds obscure the heavens, and a vioIent tempest arises, because a gIoomy mist is before our eyes, and thunder strikes our earsX and terror stupe- fies aII our faculties, aII things seem to us to be bIended in confusion; yet during the whoIe time the heavens remain in the same quiet serenity. So it must be con- cIuded. that whiIe the turbuIent state of the worId deprives us of our judgment, God, by the Iight of his own righteousness and wisdom, reguIates alI those commotions in the most exact order and directs them to their proper end.I3 He was perhaps even more concerned to refute the false interpre- tation that men placed upon the chaotic character of historical events and personal destinies. Even when God seemed to be operating in an arbitrary and capricious way irough fortune, order prevailed. It must also be observed that, although the paternal favor and beneficence of God, or the severity of his justice, is frequently conspicuous in the whole course of his providence, yet sometimes the causes of events are concealed, so that a suspicion intrudes itself that the revolutions of human affairs are conducted by the blind impetuosity of fortune; or the flesh solicits us to murmur, as thougb God amused himself with tossirlg merl about like tennis balls.l4 12"Prioris exemplum est, dum reputamus quanti fuerit artificis, hanc stellarum mul- titudinem, quae in coelo estX tam disposita serie ordinare et aptare ut nilail excogitari possit aspectu speciosius; alias ita inserere et afBigere suis stationibus ut moveri nequeant; AIiiS liberiorem cursum concedere, sed ita ut errando non ultra spatium vagentur; om- nlum motum lta temperare, ut dies et noctes, menses, annos et anni tempora metiatur et hanc quoque, quam quotidie cernimus, inaequalitatem dierum ad tale temperamentum redigere ut nihil confusionis habeat.

There were many conceptions of fortune, and Calvin is linked to this historical period by his general interest in this problem rather than by his particular position, which distinguishes him from other figures and movements. A prior consideration is again epistemological. If, as he argued, human perception has been debilitated by inherited sinn and if the vanity of self-sufliciency has tempted-men to make unwarranted in- ferences from the meager facts in their possession, how can they profess to know the truth, or how can they discover it for themselves ? Only, said Calvin, through the Scripture. For if we consider the mutability of the human mind how easy its lapse into forgetfulness of God; how great its propensity for error of every kind; how violent its rage for the perpetual fabrication of new and false religions it will be easy to perceise the necessity of heavenly doctrine being thus committed to writing, that it might not be lost in oblivion, or evaporate in error, or be cor- rupted by the presumption of men.15 It has frequently been remarked that the Bibliolatry of Protes- tantism corresponds to the humanists' adulation of the classical text. There was in Calvin such a veneration for ancient and written doc trine, buF he was no idolater. He did not consistently hold to a literal interpretation of the Scripture. He was perhaps more interested in explication and meaning than moved by a desire for simplicity and philological purity such as animated the textual criticism of men like Erasmus and Valla. He considered it demeaning to God to take the tales and superstitions of the Bible at their face value. The Anthropomorphites also, who imagined God to be corporeal, because the Scripture frequently ascribes to him a mouth, eyes) hands and feet, are easily refuted. For who, even of the meanest capacity, understands not, that God lisps, as it were with us, just as nurses are accustomed to speak with children. Where- fore such forms of expression do not clearly explain the nature of God, but accommodate the knowledge of him to our narrow capacity.16 res humanas; vel ad obloquendum nos caro sollicitet, ac si Deus homines quasi pilas iactando, ludum exerceret"; I, xvii, 1. 15 Nam si reputamus quam lubricus sit humanae mentis lapsus in Dei oblivionem quanta in omne genus erroris proclivitas, quanta ad confingendas identidem novas et fictitias religiones libido; perspicere licebit quam necessaria fuerit talis coelestis doctrinae consignatio, ne vel oblivione deperiret, vel errore evanesceret, vel audacia hominum corrumperetur; It vi, 3. l6"Anthropomorphitae etiam, qui Deum corporeum ex eo sunt imaginati quod os aures, oculos, manus et pedes scriptura illi saepe ascribit, facile refutantur.

How was he or anyone else to know that his interpretations were the truth ? Human vanity and stupidity could as easily misinterpret the Scripture as the evidence of God's works in nature. And what determined that men believed in the Scripture at all ? In the final analysis, for Calvin truth was acces- sible only to those who had been illuminated by the Holy Spirit. Let it be considered then as an undeniable truth, that they who have been in- wardly taught by the Spirit, feel an entire acquiescence in the Scripture, and that it is self-authenticated, carrying ,ith it its own evidence, and ought not to be made the subject of demonstrations and arguments from reason; but it obtains the credit it deserves with us by the testimony of the Spirit.... There- fore, being illuminated by him, we now believe the divine original of the Scripture, not from our own judgment or that of others, but we esteem the certainty that we have received it from God's own mouth by the ministry of men to be superior to that of any human judgment, and equal to that of an intuitive perception of God himself in it.l8 The fact that Calvin was so concerned with epistemological ques- tions is interesting and signiScant. Ever since the work of the four- teenth-century nominalists, the question of the certainty of knowledge had become almost as important as the content of it. This concern was to remain a constant feature of the history of modern philosophy. bus, quodammodo balbutire? Proinde tales loquendi formae non tam ad liquidum expri- munt qualis sit Deus, quam eius notitiam tenuitati nostrae accommodant", I, xiii, 1. However, Quirinus Breen (John Calvin: A Stady in Frenah Hamanism {Grand Rapids 1931], 154) argues that he gave "unqualiSed approal" to the work of Erasmus and Valla even after his preconversion humanist days. 17 Such a suggestion of a principle of interpretation based on the assumption of a changing and evolving human culture and mentality and an eternal Divine Truth, in nvhich it is the purpose of God to reveal himself according to the capacities of different ages to comprehend him, may well bear further investigation. It contrasts as much with the medieval "figural" mode of exegesis as with humanist philology, cf. Erich Auer- bach, "Figura," Arrhivgm Romanirum, XXII ( 1938), 436, and his Mimesis (Princeton, 19S3), 73-76. Calvin throws further light on his methods, showing that he adds to the notion of "prefiguration" that of "accommodation": "non propterea mutabilem iudicari Deum debere quod diversis saeculis diversas formas accommodaverit, prout cuique ex- pedire noverat" (II, xi, especially 13 and 14). Within the framework of a providential history of mankind, to which he obviously and tenaciously holds, he has introduced a notion of the historical relativism of the divine Word. 18"Maneat ergo hoc fixum, quos spiritus sanctus intus docuit, solide acquiescere in scriptura, et hanc quidem esse afiT6vtffTOP, neque demonstrationi et rationibus subiici eam fas esse; quam tamen meretur apud nos certitudinem, spiritus testimonio consequi. . .

To some it has seemed that the method of doubt was the cornerstone of science. Calvin and Calvinism never truly resolved this question, and it can be seen that it was fundamental to the whole structure of his thought. He asserted at the same time both a drastic devaluation of man's capacity to know and a great and complex doctrine about God, the world, and man. Reliance on the testimony of the Spirit did not overcome the con- tradiction. And, as is well known, the question of proof has haunted the subsequent history of Calvinism. It is perhaps of greater relevance in this paper to deal now vrith the content of Calvin's position, leaving aside the problem of proof. Perhaps the major emphasis of his theology was not merely upon the benevolence, the omniscience, and the omnipotence of God, but also upon his omnioperative character, his constant supervision and con- trol of all events, natural and historical and spiritual, and his wise and rational utilization of all men as instruments of his purpose. It is not enough to make God the Creator of the world, which then runs along according to its appointed laws. But faith ought to penetrate further. When it has learned that he is the Creator of all things, it should immediately conclude that he is also their perpetual governor and preserver; and that not by a certain universal motion, actuating the whole machine of the world, and all its respective parts, but by a particular providence sustaining, nourishing and providing for everything which he has made.l9 In place of the traditional vision of a self-sufficient God, absorbed in self-contemplation, Calvin had a new image of the deity cor- responding to the energetic man of affairs of the new economic and political order. God asserts his possession of omnipotence and claims our acknowledgment of this attribute; not such as is imagined by sophists, vain, idle and almost a,sleep, but vigilant, efficacious, operative, and engaged in continual action.20 The crucial question is how this view relates to human affairs in his 19"At vero fides altius penetrare debet, nempe ut quem omnium creatorem esse didicit, statim quoque perpetuum moderatorem et conservatorem esse colligat; neque id universali quadam motione tam orbis machinam quam singulas eius partes agitando; sed singulari quadam providentia unumquodque eorum quae condidit, ad minimum usque passerem, sustinendo, fovendo, curando"; I, xvi, 1. 20"Et sane omnipotentiam sibi vendicat ac deferri a nobis vult Deus, non qualem sophistate fingunt, inanem, otiosam et fere sopitam; sed vigilem, eScacem, operosam, et quae in continuo actu versetur '; I, xvi, 3.</page><page sequence="11">69 CHARLES TRINKAUS thinking, for it involves both the seemingly accidental nature of his- torical events that plagued men of his time, which was talked of under the concept of fortune, and the question of the scope of human capacity and action in influencing human destiny or events in gen- eral, which was discussed as the problem of free will. It is on these issues that Calvin's relation to the Renaissance may be most clearly seen. According to Calvin, while some had laid the outcome of human events to fortune, others held that God originally gave men an instinct or natural capacity for reason, and thenceforth men ran their own affairs. Although wishing to refute both views, Calvin conceded that events often seemed fortuitous and that human action "appears to proceed from voluntary inclination in the creature.''2l Particularly in the matter of social status, many "attribute it to human industry, or to fortune, that some men remain in obscurity, and others rise to honours"; nevertheless, in spite of -appearances, "it is from the secret counsel of God, that some rise to promotion and others remain in contempt. Stated thus flatly, Calvin's position of predetermination by God as far as natural and historical events are concerned, predestination and election from eternity as far as salvation, would seem to end matters and stand in patent contradiction to the newer humanistic currents of thought.23 Calvin, however, did not leave matters there where popular conceptions leave Calvinism. Instead he entered into par- ticulars about the actual operation of his doctrine and contrived to leave the world looking not so very different from the way it appeared to his contemporaries but, to his view, making more sense. In the first place, if God controlled the world in such minute detail that not a thing could happen apart -from his direction, it would seem as though human helplessness would be enormously increased. Calvin, however, was no friend of sloth and, admiring the industrious, svished no such consequence. To his mind it was not the fact of divine providence but man's uncertainty about the real state of affairs that 21 lbid., I, xvi, 4. 22". . . industriae hominum vel fortunae adscribunt quod alii iacent in sordibus, alii ad honores emergunt . . . arcano eius consilio alios excellere, alios manere con- temptibiles"; I, xvi, 6. 23 of course it is an exaggeration to think of any one humanist point of view on such matters. Opinion ranged from Valla's inability to resolve the logical contradiction be- tween predestination and free will, to the optimistic aHirmations of moral freedom by Pico or Erasmus. There probably was a unity, however, on the desirability of free will, whatever difficulties seemed to confront it. Cf. my paper on "The Problem of Free Will," cited in n. 4, above.</page><page sequence="12">70 RENAISSANCE PROBLEMS IN CALVIN S THEOLOGY paralyted him. He was, therefore, careful to try to save and explain the phenomena of both free will and fortune, although denying the ultimate reality of those forces. First he sought to show how fortune could properly be under- stood without men being reduced to inactivity by the seeming chaos of events. Yet since the dullness of our minds is very much below the sublimity of the divine providence, let us endeavor to assist them by a distinction. I say that not- withstanding the ordination of all things by a certain purpose and direction of God, yet to us they are fortuitous: not that we suppose fortune holds any domi- nation over the world and mankind, and whirls all things about at random, for such folly ought to be far from the breast of a Christian; but because the order, reason, end and necessity of events are chiefly concealed in the purpose of God, and not comprehended by the mind of man, those things are in some measure fortuitous, which must certainly happen according to the divine will.24 Such a doctrine did not need to discourage men. In fact they could now feel assured of wisdom and order behind the seeming work of fortune. The appearance of free will also had to be recognized, because iere was a grave danger that if all events were known to be divinely ordered, men would cease to act. This was not a mere juxtaposition of opposing concepts by Calvin, nor a mere pious admonition. For him free will was itself an instnument of providence. Doctrinally, his position was clear, detailed, and explicit. Many men argued as follows: "If God has fixed the moment of our death, we cannot avoid it; therefore all caution against it will be but labor lost." Men, however, took certain precautions. And men in general exert all their faculties in devising and executing methods by which they may obtain the object of their desires. Now either all these things are vain remedies employed to correct the will of God, or life and death, health and disease, peace and war, and other things which, according to their desires and their aversions, men industriously study to obtain or avoid, are not deter- mined by his certain decree.... In short they supersede all deliberations respecting futurity, as opposed to the providence of God, who without con- 24t'Quoniam tamen longe infra providentiae Dei altitudinem subsidit mentis nostrae tarditas, adhibenda est quae eam sublevet distinctio. Dicam igitur, utcunque ordinentur omnia Dei consilio certa dispensatione, nobis tamen esse fortuita. Non quod fortunam reputemus mundo ac hominibus dominari, temereque omnia sursum deorsum volutare (abesse enim a christiano pectore decet hanc vecordiam); sed quoniam eorum quae eveniunt, ordo, ratio, finis, necessitas, ut plurimum in Dei consilio latet,-et humana opinione non apprehenditur, quasi fortuita sunt, quae certum est ex Dei voluntate provenire"; I, xvi, 9.</page><page sequence="13">CHARLES TRINKAUS 71 sulting men has decreed whatever he pleased. And what has already happened they impute to the divine providence in such a manner as to overlook the person who is known to have committed any particular act. Has an assassin murdered a worthy citizen ? they say he has executed the counsel of God.... Thus by these persons all crimes are denominated virtues, because they are subsenient to the ordination of God.25 Calvin here has anticipated the stock argument against his doctrine. But he is willing to give up neither divine providence nor human responsibility. In opposition to this argument Calvin urged the greatest exercise of prudence and intelligence in the conduct of life 2S a duty in keeping with the very nature of providence. Here is hc)w he reconciled his rationalism with his deprivation of men of the determination of their destinies: He who has fixed the limits of our life, has also entrusted us with the care of it; has furnished us with means and supplies for its preservation; has also made us provident of dangers; and that they may not oppress us unawares, has furnished us with cautions and remedies. Now it is evident what is our duty. If God has committed to us the preservation of our life, we should preserve it; if he oSers supplies, we should use them; if he forewarns of dangers, we should not rush rashly into them; if he furnishes remedies, we ought not to neglect them. Indeed, the measures men took were themselves part of providence, and it became their pious duty to God to exert themselves prudently. You conclude that it is unnecessary to guard against danger, because if it be not fatalX we shall escape it without caution; but on the contrary the Lord enjoins you to use caution, because he intends it not to be fatal to you. These madmen overlook what is obvious to every observer that the arts of deliberation and caution in men proceed from the inspiration of God, and that they subserve the designs of his providence in the preservation of their own lives; as on the contrary, by neglect and slothfulness, they procure for themselves the evils which he has appointed for them. For how does it happen that a prudent man, consulting his own welfare, averts from himself impending evils, and a fool 25"Si mortis nostrae punctum signavit Dominus, eSugere non licet: frustra igitur in cautionibus adhibendis laboratur.... omnes denique vias excogitant, et magna animi intentione excudunt, quibus id quod concupiscunt assequantur: aut haec omnia inania sunt remedia, quae captantur ad corrigendam Dei voluntatem, aut non certo eius decreto terminantur vita et mors, sanitas et morbus, pax et bellum, et alia quae homines, prout vel appetunt vel oderunt, ita sua industria vel obtinere vel refugere student....

Therefore it has pleased God to conceal from us all future events that we may meet them as doubtful contin- gencies, and not fail to oppose to them the remedies with which we are pro- vided, till they shall have been surmounted or shall have overcome all our diligence.26 While this point of view may not be entirely convincing to us, to Calvin it ended the old conflict between free will and fortune that had been so particularly on the minds of Renaissance writers (e.g., Machiavelli). Both were vindicated as part of tlle providence of God. Man was incited by this doctrine to oppose his free will (or virtA) to fortune as part of the divine work; and he was not to be discouraged when his efforts failed, as this was also part of the action of his busy God. Neither God nor man might anymore be slothful. This was a new ideal of human status. God, in so far as he was conceived in the image of the elite of society, had been thought of as passively contemplative, enjoying his leisure, or as a military com- mander at the head of the hosts of the righteous, or in other roles. To Calvin, God was an artist, or an architect; but most characteristically for him, a busy God worked through busy men, who by their activity improved their position in tlle world as far as this corresponded to the divine project, and by this means furthered and cast glory upon that project. Calvin did not feel that this point of view was contrary to human needs and feelings. Understanding that the course of human events, as well as of nature, was predetermined in accordance with divine wisdom and justice, men should derive certain advantages from this. In the first place they would attribute all prosperity to God and take it as a sign of divine benediction. Secondly, calamities, whether due to 26"Namque is qui vitam nostram suis terminis limitavit, eius simul curam apud nos deposuit, eius conservandae rationibus subsidiisque instruxit, periculorum quoque prae- scios fecit, ne incautos opprimerent, cautiones ac remedias suggessit.

Tu cavendum non esse periculum colligis, quia, fatale quum non sit, simus etiam citra cautionem evasuri: Dominus autem ideo ut caveas iniungit, quia fatale tibi esse noluit.

Basically men would simultaneously make use of all human and material aids for their benefit that they were able to, and vould take responsibility for their own crimes and failures. He will rank it among the blessings of the Lord, not to be destitute of human aids which he may use for his own safety; he will neither be remiss in taking advice, therefore, nor negligent in imploring the help of those whom he per- ceives to be capable of affording him assistance; but considering all creatures that can in any respect be serviceable to him, as so many gifts from the Lord, he ,ill use them as legitimate instmments of the divine providence. And as he is uncertain respecting the issue of his undertakings, except that he knows that the Lord will in all things provide for his good, he studiously aims at what, according to the best judgment he can form, will be for his advantage. Nor in conducting his deliberations, will he be carried away by his own opinion, but will recommend and resign himself to the wisdom of God, that he may be directed to the right end. But he will not place his confidence in external helps to such a degree as, if possessed of them, securely to rely on them, or if destitute of them, to tremble with despair.27 Trust in divine providence, instead of limiting man in his pursuit of worldly goals, should, according to Calvin, strengthen his confidence in his own powers, so long as he recognized that they came from the Lord. Man also should not be ashamed to seek his own advantage, as this was again in furtherance of the divine purpose. Fortune, good or bad, was no longer indifferent to the merits of the action- di- vinely viewed, of course- but the very consequence of them. On the other hand, it should not be imagined that Calvin had a very rosy view of the external conditions of his time. In the face of the widespread misery and calamity, his doctrine, he claimed, also offered a valuable psychological reward. Amidst these difiiculties must not man be most miserable, who is half-dead while he lives, and is dispirited and alar¢ned as though he had a sword per- 27"Nam inter Domini benedictiones reponet, si non destituetur subsidiis humanis quibus ad incolumitatem suam utatur; itaque nec in capiendis consiliis cessabit, nec torpebit in ope eorum imploranda, quibus suppetere conspiciet unde iuvetur; sed a Domino sibi in manum offerri reputans quaecunque commodare sibi aliquid possunt crea- turae, ipsas, tanquam legitima divinae providentiae instrumenta, ad usum applicabit.

What can you imagine more calamitous than such a dread?28 This anxiety-ridden state of mind, arising out of tlze social and political disorders of his times-the wars, pestilences, civil dis- turbances, economic overturns, and social oppressions could not be overcome by attributing these occurrences to fortune and seeking to defy it or to flee to the green hills. Calvin's doctrine alone might prevent demoralization. On the contrary, when this light of divine providence has once shined on a pious man, he is relieved and delivered not only from extreme anxiety and dread with which he was previously oppressed, but also from all care. For, as he justly dreads fortune, so he ventures to commit laimself to God.... How is it that their sectlrity remains vInshaken, while the world appears to be revolving at random, but because they know that the Lord is universally operative, and con- Ede in his operations as beneScial to them.29 In short, "ignorance of providence is the greatest of miseries, but the knowledge of it is attended with the highest felicity."29 When Calvin turned from his vindication of the divine providence in Book I of the Instittes to his depiction of the state and nature of fallen man in Book II, he was notoriously contemptuous of man. Despite his deprecation, however, he did not deprive man of an ability to control human affairs and to direct the course of nature through science. He thought of man as deprived of free will and thoroughly corrupted morally by the Fall of Adam. But what is fre- quently overlooked is that he meant this lack of free will to apply primarily to man's ability to determine his spiritual condition. Man cc)uld not save himself no matter how hard he tried; and moral virtue carried with it no merit toward justification and salvation, since the latter were predestined from eternity. It is significant, however, that in fact Calvin recognized the capacities of man in secular and social matters, though he denied them in spiritual things. Such spiritual abilities as leading a happy life or loving one's neighbor 28"Inter has angustias annon oportet miserrimum esse hominem, utpote qui in vita semivivus anxium et languidum spiritum aegre trahat, non secus ac si imminentem perpetuo cervicibus gladium haberet ? . . .

I, XVii, 1O. 29"At ubi lux illa divinae providentiae semel homini pio aSulsit iam non extrema modo, qua ante premebatur, anxietate et formidine, sed omni cura reievatur ac solvitur. Ut enim merito fortunam horret, ita secure Deo sese audet permittere....

Free will with regard to spiritual matters was totally annihilated by the Fall. Man was exiled from the kingdom of God in such a manner that all the affections relating to the happy life of the soul are also extinguished in him, till he recovers them by the grace of regeneration. Such are faith, love to God, charity towards our neighbors and an attachment to holiness and righteousness. All these things being restored by Christ, are esteemed adventitious and preternatural; and therefore we conclude that all have been lost.30 As for men's natural capacities, Calvin mas able to have it two Brays. On tlle one hand, they were debilitated and corrupted, thereby allowing him to account for human inadequacies and failures in the practical and speculative realms. At the same time, however, men retained some of their original powers, thereby sllowing his recog- nition of the obvious capacities of men. Calvin made it clear that he felt men did retain very great rational powers. He described the vanity of the intellect and its overcurious pursuit of the fruitless and the unimportant, its lack of judgment. Yet, he conceded, it was capable of making discoveries about inferior matters and even had some slight sense of superior things. To make his position clear he felt that it will be useful for us to propose the following distinction; that there is one understanding for terrestrial things, and another for celestial ones.... In the first class are included civil polity, domestic economy, all the mechanical arts and liberal sciences; in the second the knowledge of God and of the divine will and the rules for conformity to it in our lives.31 °°"Unde sequitur, ita exsulare a regno Dei, ut quaecunque ad beatam animae vitam spectant, in eo exstincta sunt, donec per regenerationis gratiam ipsa recuperet. In his sunt, fides, amor Dei, caritas erga proximos, sanctitatis et iustitiae studium.

Even crirninals con- sented with their minds, although their passions were too powerful to restrain them; others who were critical of injustice in the laws recognized a higher law in equity. "Yet it is certainly true that some seeds of political order are sown in the minds of all." No doubt his early study of civil law and his youthful commentary on Seneca's De clementid32 had sown seeds of admiration for political justice in Calvin's mind. In his admiration of man's mental and manual facilities, 11e re- jected the Platonic theory of the recollection of ideas from a previous existence in favor of a theory of invention and intellectual progress. Scarcely an individual can be found whose sagacity does not assert itself in some particular art. Nor have they an energy and facility only in learning, but also in inventing something new in every art, or in amplifying and improving what they have learned from their predecessors.33 Because these capacities were unequally distributed to men, it was clear to Calvin that they were the gift of the Spirit both to man- kind generally and to some individuals in more specific ways. But whereas some excel in penetration, others possess superior judgment, and others have a greater aptitude to learn this or that art; in this variety God dis- plays his goodness toward us, that no one may arrogate to himself as his own what proceeds merely from divine liberality.... God inspires particular motions according to the vocation of each individual.34 The importance of Calvin's doctrine of vocation, beyond the fact that it gave a religious sanction to the existing division of labor, lies in the stress he placed upon the individual's duty to carry out his special abilities effectively. In this way each man would actually be societe humaine." Cf. also Josef Bohatec, Bude uzzd Calzin (Graz, 1950), 383-95. Cal- vin's clearest praise of the ancients is in II, ii, 15; "Imo ne sine ingenti quidem admi- ratione veterum scripta legere de his rebus poterimus; admirabimur autem, quia prae- clara, ut sunt, cogemur agnoscere ! " 39 Breen, op, ri., chaps. 3, 4, 5; Wendel, op. rit., 8-20; Bohatec, op. rit., 439-64. 33"Nemo prope reperitur cuius in arte aliqua perspicientia non se exserat.

Ar the same time failure to use his abilities svell would penalize the individual in regard to his own material existencbe- toloening God's punishment of his negligence. In this way Calvin made an important distinction between the gen- eral work of the Spirit operating through all men for the objective furtherance of the divine scheme, and the special work of the Spirit in justifying certain men only for salvation. The doctrine of voccltion applied tc) all men, because the rewards and penalties for'successful or inadequate application of one's endowments by the Spirit were all of this world. The doctrine of electioss applied only to the "saints.'&gt; These gifts of vocation were, nevertheless, an essential part of CTod's objective mandate and plan. As such they should not be spurned by the pious. Yet let us not forget that these are most excellent gifts of the Spirit, wllich for the common benefit of mankind he dispenses to whomsoever he pleases.... Nor is there any reason for inquiring what intercourse with the Spirit is enjoyed by the impious who are entirely alienated from God. For when tlle Spirit of God is said to dwell in the faithful only, that is to be understood of the Spirit of sanctification, by whom we are consecrated as temples to God himself. Yet it is equally by the energy of the same Spirit, that God replenishes, acsuates, and quickens all creatures, and that according to the property of each species which he has given it by the law of creation. Now if it has pleased the Lord that we should be assisted in physics, logic, mathematics, and other arts and sciences, by the labor and ministry of the impious, let us make use of them; lest if we neglect to use the blessings therein freely offered to us by God, we- suffer the just punishment of our negligence. But, lest anyone should suppose a man to be truly happy, when he is admitted to possess such powerftll ener- gies for discovering the truth relating to the elements of this world, it must likewise be added, that all the faculty of understanding, and the under- standing whicll is the consequence of it, is in the sight of God, a fleeting and transitory thing, where there is not a solid foundation of truth.35 35"Neque tamen interim obliviscamur haec praestantissima divini spiritus esse bona, quae in publicum generis humani bonum, quibus vult, clispensat....

He gives a support to worldiness which at the same time subordinates it to providence, and a subordination of worldiness to divine purposes whicll simultaneously appreciates the objective results of human activity and discounts its ultimate meaning. This ambivalent attitude corresponds very closely to the joyless pursuit of knowledge and material wealth which seemed to be incumbent on all men but yielded no deep satisfactions because of its perils, uncertainty, and, even more, lack of a clear relationship to human spiritual happiness. This was not the mood of much of the Rerlaissarlce, but it was the mood of a good many humaPnists and of other sensitive merl of the time. And it was to this dour tone that Calvinism appealed.36 Calvin was, perhaps, correct in feeling that such a worldly activity could lead men away from their spiritual fulhllment, and in recog- nizing that it was at the same time not directly or necessarily opposed to man's highest potentialities. Such a divorce betweetl spiritual de- velopment and economic or technical progress was a cultural con° dition that many writers had commented on since the early fourteenth century. Calvin theologized it into the objective work of the divine mandate. What it came to with him was a plea to accept the existing stage of human development as the final and inscrutable work of God. By his theory of a twofold human understanding Calvin contributed to a process of externalization of humarl motives. This very simply means exactly what he was preaching that man by his own eSorts in science and material activities had some possibility of realizing limited worldly goals, but none at all of achieving moral and spiritual ends. Calvin was, of course, very critical of the debasement of man involved in this condition, but at the same time he could not help reinforcing it by regarding it as the just punishment of man's sins and by excluding the possibility of other conditions. Calvin sought to restore an integrity between motivation and action. He was particularly acute in seeing that tlle existing separation between internal intentions and external actions was in many ways more apparent than real. But his acuteness of perception could not 3fi Breen makes much of the positive aspects of Calvin's doctrine of "common grace" as a bond linking him to the humanists (Op. rit., 159). He does, however, subject secu- lar capacities to providence and makes it a pious duty to cultivate them. I have analyzed the prevalence of a pessimistic note in some of the humanists in my Adversity's Noble- men (New York, 1940) and have emphasized a similar concern about the relation of vocation to happiness in "Petrarch's Views of the Individual and His Society," Osiril XI (1954), 168-98. Wendel indicates that one of Calvin's purposes in depicting the capacities and insights of the impious was to prove that men were without excuse for their sins, since they had a knowledge of good and evil ( op. rit., 1SS).</page><page sequence="21">CHARLES TRINKAUS 79 change the contradictions, so that he was driven to more radical conclusions about the moral capacities of human nature than those of most previous thinkers concerned with this problem. The latter, including many llumanists, were content to recognize a separation be- tween the subjective and objective spheres of life and tended to look either for an exclusively subjective fulfillment or for moral reform of the external sphere. Calvin, in effect, restored a negative integrity by arguing that neither in action nor in motivation was man in effective control over himself. He was corrupt internally and externally, although capable in a spiritually neutral way externally. It is important to suggest that for many of his contemporaries tiliS condition utas a vivid part of their experience of life. If this was so, Calvin's denial of free will had a great deal more plausibility for these men than it does for our own more easily offended moral sensibilities. Calvin went much further in his discussion of this question in the remaining part of Book II of the Iostitutes, wllere he took up the inner spiritual and psychological side of man in great detail, and in Book III, where he discoursed on how within the framesvork of his theolo,gy a Christian might piously conduct his life. Enough has been said, however, to indicate the essentials of his position on the nature and life of man. In summary, Calvin was concerned with several closely connected questions tilat might be considered "Renaissance Problems," namely (a) the epistemological question of the relation of subjective per- ception to objective truth, (b) the related question of man and tlle universe microcosonos and cosmos-(c) the question of the fortui- tous or providential character of events, and (d) the question of man's free will. Professor Battenhouse has shown that Calvin in his notion of the original condition of man before the Fall derived his ideas from tlle Platonists' high estimates of the spiritual potentialities of-human nature.37 I have tried to show how even in his conception of fallen man Calvin also shared the high regard of the Renaissance for man's capacities in the practical and intellectual splleres. Where he differed from his contemporaries, and particularly from the humanists, was in completely abandoning any hope for the spiritual or moral re- generation of mankind by its own eSorts, and in believing that the small minority of the Elect, alone, for some inscrutable reason of God's were decreed from eternity for justification.

As Professor Battenhouse has pointed out,38 this image also was shared with the neoplatonists, and it was constantly utilized by Shakespeare. But in all these others, and in most of the liumanists, there was a concern for mere man, and a tragic sorrow at his plight that is hard to find in the more realistic, more logical, and harsher theology of Calvin.
