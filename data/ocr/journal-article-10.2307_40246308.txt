<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Portrait of the Artist as a Caricaturist: Picasso, Joyce, Britten PETER EGRI A caricature is a comic re-creation of a model done in the spirit of intellectual recreation. The re-shaping of the original implies the element of its relativization through a critical sense of incongruous contrast between the actual and the desirable, the disharmonious and the harmonious, the apparent and the real, the real and the true, the irrational and the rational, the ephemeral and the essential, the relative and the absolute. Such characteristic procedures of carica- ture as ironical exaggeration and sarcastic distortion serve the pur- pose of increasing and intensifying the contrast. Although there exist almost as many varieties of caricature as there are examples, three major categories may be instrumental in determining the special brand of caricature Picasso, Joyce and Brit- ten most excelled in. The three types may be conveniently termed occasional, trend, and universal caricatures. An occasional caricature is an incidental gibe at a chance pheno- menon. Its humorous banter does not cut deep, its target is usu- ally light, slight and small, and it may even involve the general ac- ceptance of a person or thing some trait of whose is ironically rela- tivized. Its gentle teasing or sharper mockery have been known and experienced both in life and art from ancient to modern times. An illustrated joke of a humorous magazine or the exaggerated imita- tion of the ticking of the metronome in the second movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 8 are characteristic examples. For all his acute sense of the tragically grim discord and discor- dance of contemporary social relations, Picasso seems to have been interested in occasional caricature throughout his creative career. At the age of 12, he "edited" a humorous paper for fun, and a number of his later graphic works can be taken as grotesque expres- sions of his sarcastic wit, examples or approximations of occasional caricature: Travesty of Manet's Olympia (1901), Guillaume Apolli- naire (1905), Igor Stravinsky (1920), The Toad (1949), Female ©1982 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois 00 1 0-4 1 32/82/0600-0098/302.40/0</page><page sequence="2">98 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Composition (1950), Balzac (1952), The Reclining Model (1954), Old Man and Young Woman with Masks (1954), Don Quixote (1955), Portrait of DM. Kahnweiler (1957), A Double Face (1959), Faun and Goat (1959), Spectators (1961), etc. These works are comparable in style with Joyce's humorous or satirical poems such as "O Jimmie Joyce you are my darling," "Dear, I am asking a favour," "O, there are two brothers, the Fays," "The Holy Office," "Gas from a Burner," "There is a young gallant named Sax," "There's a monarch who knows no repose," "A Gold- schmidt swam in a Kriegsverein," "There's a George of the Georges named David," "Dooleysprudence," "Rouen is the rainiest place," or "A Portrait of the Artist as an Ancient Mariner."1 The parallel between Picasso's and Joyce's occasional caricatures is not restricted to a comical theme, a humorous treatment and an adopted genre, but it also extends to the manner in which the artist molded the material: in these pieces both Picasso and Joyce adhere, as a rule, to traditional forms, even when otherwise and in other works they have already developed their avantgarde techniques.2 (With Joyce a natural exception is the free verse pattern of "Rouen is the rainiest place getting / Inside all impermiables, wetting. . .," which is a parody of T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land; and with Picasso the imaginative pictorial idiom of the dry point print entitled Fe- male Composition, which is an ingenious combination of a lissom blossom, a reclining woman, and a cross-eyed old man with a mous- tache.) Incidentally, Joyce himself drew a caricature of Leopold Bloom in Myron C. Nutting's studio in the 1920s. Another class of caricature is trend-based in the sense that it re- flects an opposition in social trends and artistic attitudes. The his- torical soil for the creation of this kind of caricature was character- ized by Marx in his Critique of Hegel's "Philosophy of Right " De- scribing in 1844 the comic historical anachronism of the German ancien régime which could not help hiding its real nature under the appearance of an alien nature, he wrote: The modern ancien régime is nothing but the humbug of a world order whose real heroes are dead. History is thorough, and passes through many phases when it conveys an old form to the grave. The final phase of a world-historical form is its comedy. The Greek Gods, already once mortally wounded, tragically, in Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, had to die once more, comically, in the dialogues of Lucian. Why does history proceed in this way? So that mankind will separate itself happily from its past.3 A trend caricature calls into doubt the justification of a social and artistic trend, relativizes its very basis, and presupposes the artist's social and moral commitment to a cause, a trend. Its vigorous wit is especially sharp in cases where well-marked trends and stances clash</page><page sequence="3">EGRI 99 within or between social systems. Periods of change with their con- flicting aspirations are especially favorable for trend caricatures. Shakespeare's Falstaff in Henry IV and The Merry Wives of Windsor, Cervantes' Don Quixote, Swift's Gulliver's Travels, Fielding's Joseph Andrews, Hogarth's series (The Harlot's Progress, The Rake's Progress, Marriage à la Mode, An Election), Sterne's Tristram Shandy, Mozart's Osmin in The Abduction from the Seraglio, Daumier's satirical litho- graphs, Shaw's The Dark Lady of the Sonnets and Cymbeline Re- finished, or some of the scenes in Picasso's series The Dreams and Lies of Franco are varied and typical examples. A universal caricature differs from an occasional and trend-based one both in quantity and in quality. Its target is not just an incidental trait of a complex phenomenon as in an occasioned caricature, nor merely some social-artistic trend relativized and devalued from the viewpoint of another specific social-artistic trend as in a trend cari- cature. The irony of a universal caricature is directed against a vast field of social life and its cultural manifestations, not infrequently against a human plight or sometimes against the human predicament. In the latter case, which is an extreme possibility, nothing is found absolute in the ironically illuminated sphere but the very principle of relativity. The quality of representation, expression and molding is deter- mined by a radical separation between the customary appearance of reality and the system of values which the artist may also experience relative, or may be in search of, or may possess, assert and vindicate. Immediate reality has no truth any more, and truth has no immedi- ate reality as yet. The experience of technological advance and alienation, of two world wars, revolutions and counter-revolutions, fascism and anti- fascism, socialism and sectarianism have left behind a sense of his- torical relativism. Freud's psychoanalysis has relativized the oppo- sition between the conscious and unconscious spheres of the human soul. Bergson's philosophy has conceived of the difference between subjective and objective time as relative. Planck's Quantum Theory, Einstein's Theory of Relativity, Rutherford's discovery of the atomic nucleus, Bohr's theory of the complementarity of apparently contra- dictory statements, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle obliterating the dividing line between the potential and the actual have relativ- ized the cosmology of classical physics, increased the impression of disorientation and the need for reorientation.4 AU these factors, as well as the mutual incompatibility and incongruence between what the isolated artist and the general public appreciate and depreciate, have contributed to creating the cultural climate for the universal type of caricature Picasso, Joyce and Britten are individually dif- ferent but equally characteristic exponents of.</page><page sequence="4">100 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES II Picasso's procedure is very apparent in the relationship between Courbet's oil painting, Young Ladies of the Banks of the Seine (Les Demoiselles des bords de la Seine, 1856) and Picasso's 1950 Cubist variation on the theme, painted on plywood. The line of Picasso's continuous descent from Courbet's artistic endeavors has not infrequently been stressed and, I feel, sometimes overstressed. Apollinaire in Les Peintres cubistes expresses unambiguously the view that Courbet is the father of the new painters.5 John Berger elaborates on the idea: "No painter before Courbet was ever able to emphasize so uncompromisingly the density and weight of what he was painting. You can see it in the way he painted an apple or a wave, or in the way he painted the heavy languor and the creased dresses of the two girls lying by the Seine."6 Finding the equiva- lent of the physical sensation of the material objects portrayed (weight, temperature, texture, the force of gravity), Courbet be- trayed an interest in objects which the Cubists in their own way responded to. Assessing the double inheritance Courbet and Ce- zanne had bequeathed to Picasso, Berger remarks: "Before Cézanne, every painting was to some extent like a view seen through a win- dow. Courbet had tried to open the window and climb out. Cezanne broke the glass. The room became part of the landscape, the viewer part of the view."7 Courbet changed the material density of the view; Cézanne modified and multiplied the viewpoint. Pierre Cabanne establishes especially close links between Courbet's and Picasso's versions of Young Ladies of the Banks of the Seine. He points out how much Picasso admired Courbet's daring achievement of standing up against official academic conventions and representing his figures without any kind of stiffness, in contemporary costumes and in a natural plein air setting. Cabanne admits, of course, that the sensuous aspect of Courbet's representation disappears in Picas- so's picture, but attributes the phenomenon to the fact that Picasso is not satisfied with the expression of a mere episode of life, but wishes to eternalize all moments of rest, calm and joy apprehending totality rather than a single anecdote. His primary concern is essence rather than appearance. This is Picasso's way of accentuating the im- pression of serenity, relaxation under the shadow of trees by the bank of the river.8 The Picasso I have seen, I must confess, is a totally different pic- ture. It is not the increased expression of the essence of all moments of rest, calm and joy, but an essential rejection of rest and calm and an ironical refutation of serenity and relaxation. In the relationship of Courbet's and Picasso's pictures the dominant and determining element is not continuity but discontinuity.

The more minutely Picasso ad- heres to the details of Courbet's painting, the more radically he rela- tivizes and ironizes the basic assumptions of its artistic universe. This is apparent in the themes, attitudes, structures and colors the two painters have adopted. Picasso's painting is a variation on Courbet's theme, but the varia- tion is so bold that it has, in fact, modified the original theme. Let it suffice to point out the aesthetic consequence of the fact that Picasso has thoroughly shortened the vertical dimension of Courbet's pic- ture9 and thus eliminated the sky, the clouds, the opposite bank, the view over the river, and most of the foliage of the trees. In doing so, he has made it rather obvious that his subject is not a refreshing relaxation in nature, but rather an ironic reversal of the idea, experi- ence and mood. A caricature does not need a vista. The two painters' attitudes to their themes are diagonally op- posed. Courbet's is characterized by sympathy and empathy, Picas- so's by irony and alienation. A comparison of the girls' faces in the two paintings betrays the difference of stance with which they have been modelled. Courbet is far from idealizing the girls; they "are caught off their guard in this retreat, one sleep-relaxed in her fatten- ing charms, the other looking out at the world with tired eyes that have lost all illusions."10 They are for sale for the rich. Their dresses are more refined than their faces. The sleeping brunette's features are somewhat coarse, the blonde resting on one elbow is contem- plating the world with hurt, hopeless and helpless bitterness. "We feel the hardening of her face, its pathos, its mixture of desperation and calm acceptance."11 The hard lines of their faces, however, are shown as the imprints of their hard lives; and the way in which the foliage shelters and nature embraces them indicates the artist's com- passion. The point of the charge is directed against society which acknowledged the assault by a critical attack against Courbet. Picasso - following a Cubist practice dating back to the 1920s - doubles the faces of both girls, turns the two profiles against one another, confronts them sharply in geometrically stylized lines, builds them together in a unified construction, stiffens the faces into masks, and underlines animal qualities. The eyes even of Courbet's sleeping girl are wide open in Picasso's reinterpreting caricaturistic reversal, and her upper and lower profiles penetrate one another in such a clasp of a kiss, as if Picasso meant to caricature both the girl's sweetly self-indulgent amorous expression and the attitudes of Cour- bet's Lesbian nudes.12 The idyllic aspect of Courbe t's Demoiselles is radically rejected by Picasso's transposition.13</page><page sequence="7">EGRI 103 This opposition of attitudes asserts itself in the principles of com- position as well. Courbet's plastic figures become flattened-out and clashing geometrical planes arranged in accordance with Cubist strategy. The continuity of surfaces is broken into conflicting com- partments. The natural perspective of a single view is replaced by the scientific simultaneity of a multiple view. The opposition be- tween here and there, behind and before, now earlier and later, mind and body, body and dress, dress and grass, human and non-human, living and dead, subject and object is relativized into a rich, restless and decorative tapestry-like pattern in which fingers have the shapes of leaves, fringes of luminous waves are personified into living fig- ures; and geometrical patterns and sections, cells and compartments, illuminated and dark areas alternate and multiply in the spatial rhythm of an imposed order. The ornamental tendency inherent in Picasso's version of the Demoiselles is aptly characterized by Wil- helm Boeck and Jaime Sabartés' Picasso: The figures seem largely dissolved into coloured line and surface or- nament, so that only isolated features - heads, hands, shoes - are recognizable. The other realistic elements are enveloped in a mys- terious veil of forms; their significance is systematically denied, as Islamic art had done for a thousand years. The affinity between Anda- lusian and Moslem art - demonstrable also in Picasso's earlier periods - is seldom disclosed as clearly as it is in this painting. The mysterious transformation of nature in Demoiselles springs from the same roots as the Spaniard's passion for peinture écrite, an expressive pictorial script without representational content.1 Even if this is no more than a tendency, and the representational quality of Picasso's painting cannot be denied, the direction of the stream is unmistakable. The predominance of line in this caricature and in caricatures in general is not fortuitous: even in everyday life lines and outlines mark, separate and determine visual phenomena. In a caricature, visual demarcation develops into intellectual discrimination and critical judgment so indispensable for the fixation of a contrast of comic incongruence. This explains why caricatures are so often drawn, and even if they are painted, the picture is usually patterned by the organizing force of the line. While, in an occasional caricature lines, as a rule, underline even through exaggeration and distortion some visible features of the phenomenon, in a universal caricature they frequently disintegrate and reorganize the sight.15 The coloring of Courbet's and Picasso's paintings is also markedly different. Courbet's natural, local colors are superseded by a rich,</page><page sequence="8">104 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES dense and decorative color-scheme. The impression of feminine nakedness, the modelling power of various shades of flesh-colored brownish and pinkish yellows, so obvious in the girls' faces, arms, necks and décolletages, are lost; instead a ghastly bright white is used, which forms a pattern and is rhythmically repeated on the curving and angular planes and decorative patches of the sleeping girl's fingers, hands, arms, left profile, dress, breast and feet, as well as on her companion's wing-like hat, horse-like face (right profile),16 schematized bouquet, bent foot, the slit-like lines of the water, and even the head, arm and part of the belly of the cricket-like figure Picasso reads into the girls' bag, and also uses as the personified equivalent of a patch of bright water seen through the leaves. The gently breathing blue expanse of water, heightened by pearly reflexes and reinforced by the blue vista of the sky in the Courbet is replaced by a configuration of toned-down yellows, lending the water the texture of timber, and also cropping up on the contour of the musing girl's left face and wrist, on the sleeping girl's left pro- file, as well as on the belly, back and legs of the cricket-like figure and its counterpart at the upper right corner of the Picasso. The blue of the Seine and the sky, however, returns in the color of the dress and right profile of Picasso's sleeping girl. The greyish light blue heightened and refined by touches of transparent white in the dress of Courbet's girl becomes a definitely darker, enamel-like, sharp mid-blue in Picasso's painting. In Courbet's original, the dreaming girl's dress is pliant, in Picasso's translation it is brittle. In the Courbet the contiguous colored surfaces (of white and yellow- ish gray bordered by brownish red) are mild, soft and tender, and caress, as it were, the girl; in the Picasso the corresponding blues, blacks and whites are in a discordant counterpoint, create a strong contrast, and visibly contribute to the breaking up of the figure into a geometrical arabesque the inner rhythm of which reintegrates the disintegrated elements into a decorative composition. The same ap- plies to the yellow- and black-striped glowing red dress of the musing girl, who in the Courbet wears a vieux-rose dress; or to the contrasted white and brown profiles of Picasso's girl the color of whose shaded brown face sounds a deep-toned visual rhyme with the various browns of the boat, the tree trunks, some Negro masks, or the faces of some of the Demoiselles d'Avignon. Even nature is unnatural in the Picasso. By substantially reducing the height of Courbet's picture, the sheltering green foliage of the three trees has been essentially removed with a part of the remaining stripe painted brown.17 Besides, the green of the grass has been made so intense, and the fallen green leaves, set against a black background (or stylized black ground), have been shaped so sharp, pointed and blade-like that the impression of idyllic relaxation and refreshment</page><page sequence="9">EG RI 105 in nature, so characteristic of Courbet's version, is obviously and deliberately dispelled. Thus the color-scheme of Picasso's painting functions in the same way as its structural pattern does: both ironically relativize, dismem- ber and reassemble the original model with the result that a peace- ful human scene is transformed into a geometrically conceived and restlessly vibrating decorative pattern in which subjective, human qualities are subordinated to objective, factual properties. The hu- man being with his subjective fancies becomes a fanciful frieze. Are Courbet's demoiselles mere commodities, objects of plea- sure? So Picasso makes them part of a reified, "objective" network. Are they distorted human beings? So Picasso distorts their very physical appearance. Do they wish to return to nature? So Picasso endows them with animal characteristics. Are they pleasingly color- ful and enticingly decorative? So Picasso reduces them to a level where they are hardly more than motifs of a many-colored, orna- mental pattern which by arranging actualities also creates and keeps a distance from immediacy. The irony of such a distortion, reduction, transformation and re- integration implies and involves the unreserved expression of the total predicament of human alienation which is a state of existence or form of activity deprived of the properties of human values. This is why it results in a universal type of caricature. The pattern itself is paradoxically ambiguous; it is a destroyer and a preserver of values: it disintegrates through réintégration, recomposes through decompo- sition, rejects through assertion, and affirms through denial. Picasso resorted to this kind of caricature quite frequently in his mature period, as is attested by his Women at the Fountain, after Poussin's Eliezer and Rebecca (1921), Bacchanal, after Poussin9 s The Triumph of Pan (1944),18 David and Bathsheba, after Cranach the Elder (1947-8), Venus and Cupid, after Cranach the Elder (1949), Portrait of a Painter, after El Greco (1950), The Face of Peace, after Courbet's Lady with Gull (1950), the series Women of Algiers, after Delacroix (1954-5), Bust of a Woman, after Cranach the Younger (1958), or the two witty sequences Las Meninas, after Velazquez (1957-8), and The Luncheon on the Grass, after Manet (1962).19 The depiction of acrobats, animals, social, psychological and sex- ual outcasts, the atmospheric use of symbolic blue and rose coloring, the methods of analytic and synthetic Cubism, the adoption of a decorative network and the creation of universal caricatures are but various aspects and degrees (thematic and formal articulations) of a concentrated and converging endeavor to find an appropriate medi- um through which Picasso's experience of the modern world can be conveyed and patterned.</page><page sequence="10">106 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES III By the time of World War I James Joyce's view of the world had also been characterized by the experience of relativity. His contem- poraries' accounts of him and the findings of critics and literary his- torians all bear out his disorientation and scepticism. In a conversa- tion with Padraic Colum, Joyce said: "It would be a great imperti- nence for me to think that I could tell the world what to believe."20 Shortly after the outbreak of the war, he declared: My political faith can be expressed in a word: Monarchies, consti- tutional or unconstitutional, disgust me. Kings are mountebanks. Republics are slippers for everyone's feet. Temporal power is gone and good riddance. What else is left? Can we hope for monarchy by divine right? Do you believe in the Sun of the Future?21 To Georges Borach Joyce admitted to being against every state, be- cause "The state is concentric, man is eccentric/'22 Joyce's concept of the universal loss of values led to his particular brand of universal caricature. Ulysses, seen from this point of view, is an ingenious eccentric's sense of the senselessness of the human con- dition. The network of symbolic cross-references between Homer's Odyssey and Joyce's Ulysses is a constant source of caricature. Awakening to their new, humdrum, petty bourgeois lives are the hero Odysseus in the spineless Bloom, the devoted family man Telemachus in Dedalus who breaks away from home, the faithful Penelope in the multiple adulteress Molly, the enchanting Nausicaa in the excitable little Gerty MacDowell who displays her charms, and the bewitching Circe in the brothel-keeper Bella Cohen.23 The point, however, is that this kind of caricature is double-edged. On the one hand, in Joyce's Homeric parallels every aspect of the ideals of the harmonic, heroic world in the Odyssey appears out- dated and comical. On the other hand, the Odyssey, thanks to its symbolic and structural contribution to the microcosm of Ulysses, is a heroic version of a petty world whose triviality it makes more prominent and so more ridiculous. The corresponding figures render themselves mutually ridiculous. This double incongruity, however, does not ultimately express any particular unambiguous value judg- ment.24 Ideals are relative, irony is universal. A dual irony inherent both in the treatment of a classical frame- work and of its contemporary application is also typical of much of Picasso's work, such as his Bathers (1921), Women at the Fountain, after Poussin ys Eliezer and Rebecca (1921), Model and Surrealist Sculpture (1933), Bacchanal, after Poussin fs The Triumph of Pan (1944), Antibes (1946), Triptych (1946), Combat of Centaurs (1946), Two Stories: The Centaur Picador, The Twilight of a Faun (1947), The Judgment of Paris (1951), Faun and Goat (1959), Homage to</page><page sequence="11">EGRI 107 Bacchus (1960), or Three Masked Figures and Sphinx (1965). A simi- larly Janus-faced irony can be observed in the relationship of the pat- tern applied and the thing or person patterned in his witty Student with a Pipe (1913), The Violin (1913), Harlequin (1915), Reclining Woman (1915), The Three Musicians (1921), Seated Bather (1929), Monument: Woman's Head (1929), Girls with a Toy Boat (1937), Meanad (1946), Nursing Mother (1952), The Coiffure (1954), Las Meninas, after Velazquez (1957-8), and even in Juan Gris' Cubist Portrait of Picasso (1911-1).25 Joyce's caricaturistic achievement in Ulysses reaches its climax in the pastiches and parodies of episode 14 ("The Oxen of the Sun").26 A case in point is the passage describing the birth of Mrs. (Mina) Pure- foy's child in the style of Charles Dickens:27 "Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy accouchement. " The skill of the physician, Dr. Dixon, was that of a junior surgeon; his patience was certainly in proportion to his professional skill: Mrs. Purefoy had been in labor for days, and the student doctor shared his time between his patient and his drinking pals. Nonetheless, the very first sentence of Joyce's caricature radiates the mood of Dickensian propriety, and by the choice of the italicized French term accouche- ment it precludes any possibility of even a linguistic impropriety - in true Victorian fashion. "It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor," - just as it had been "a weary weary while" for Doady to endure the period of Dora's fatal illness in Chapter LIII of David Copperfield. 28 "All that surgical skill could do," or, to put it more correctly, all that a bibulous doctor's skill could do in 1904 "was done and the brave woman had manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy." The semantic incongruity of the brave woman's manful help is a satirical exposition and exposure of mild Dickensian humor (of the "I am so glad, yet so sorry" brand) in the form of a Joycean paradox. The cumulative effect of the insistence of "She had" shows ironically how anxious Dickens is to make a point. Moreover, since "She had" does not only repeat the message of the previous sentence, but in- evitably also makes the first two words of the following sentence {"She had fought the good fight") a literal repetition, it creates the mocking impression that Dickens is stammering. It is all the more funny because what he is straining for with the repetition is only the somewhat ponderous statement of a commonplace ("She had fought the good fight"), which is only accentuated by the stereo- type of yet another repetition: "and now she was very very happy." Dickens' Dora, too, was "very happy, very", and wanted "very, very much" to see Agnes. The narrator in David Copperfield often states commonplaces: "I ... feel the truth that trifles make the sum of life." He also has an inclination to use set phrases such as "the sea of my remembrance" or "that rain of tears."</page><page sequence="12">108 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES In the next sentence of Joyce's parody happiness, gratitude and even the husband soon assume universal proportions: Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. The self-congratulating epithet of "the touching scene," the humor- ous quality of the author patting his own shoulder in the superfluous- ly verbose comment of "a pretty sight it is to see" (ridiculing Dickens- ian claims like "I have bethought me of all that gracious and compas- sionate history"), the somewhat garrulous doubling of the clause ex- pressing departure, the earlier coupling of "Weary weary" and "very very," as well as the moving sweetness of the maternal scene, justify Stuart Gilbert's observation: "There is a pretty-pretty picture of the mother and babe, as Dickens might have written it."*9 The sham rid- dle of "One above" immediately solved in "the Universal Husband" also has a veritable Dickensian touch. By way of a characteristically intimate and homely association, the image of the omnipresent Universal Husband is shifted into the figure of the actual husband, the conscientious if aging second ac- countant of the Ulster Bank, now lamentably absent: And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch. O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days. God, how beautiful now across the mist of years! Theodore Purefoy repeatedly called by his Dickensian petname Doady, the Victorian emphasis on, and the Joycean assurance of, the lawful embraces of the faithful lifemate, the sentimental clichés of "that mite of God's clay," "the whirligig of years," "the mist of years," Mina's emotional reminiscences of "that faroff time of the roses," and her rhetorically balanced, touching antithesis figuring Doady, "loved one of old, faithful lifemate now," also recalling the attitude, style and the very subtitle ("Another Retrospect") of chapter LIII of David Copperfield, all combine in "a burlesque of Dickensian sentiment."30 The burlesque is all the more effective since sublime and sentimental qualifications are contrasted with minutely practical and technical details: Mr. Theodore Purefoy's</page><page sequence="13">EGRI 109 "grave dignity" is the property of Mina's beloved Doady, i.e. the second accountant of the Ulster Bank, College Green branch. In this way, the lower middle class character of the family idyll is brought home. It is even further strengthened by the evidence of snobbery attested by the names of some of the nine Purefoy children: "dar- ling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar)" and Mortimer Edward, i.e. young hopeful, the new-born baby to be named "after the in- fluential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer's office, Dublin Castle." J.S. Atherton rightly sees in this a parody of "Dickens's combination of humour with social criticism. * The Dickensian flavor of Joyce's witty imitation is increased by the use of telling detail ("that longing hunger for baby fingers," "the old shake" of Mina's "pretty head" with which she recalls old days, or "the true Purefoy nose" of the baby), tableau-like scenes rounding off details in a graphically portrayed Hegelian objective totality (mother and child in a concrete setting), an anthropomorphic representation (objects mediate human relations; even Time is hu- manized and personified into jovial and benign father Cronion), and a synthesizing quality (the passage gives a comically contracted, but even so a memorably self-contained picture of the past, present and future of the Purefoy family).33 Joyce finishes his Dickens caricature, assuming the attitude of the omniscient Victorian novelist who, after involving his audience in a confidential conspiracy ("you and I may whisper it"), finally even addresses his own heroine and hero: No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His own good time. You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant! Thus at the pious coda34 and harmonious culmination of his in- genious mockery, Joyce shows Dickens not only pathetically moving, but also genuinely moved. It may be worth noting that chapter LIII of David Copperfield also ends with the imminent death of Dora and the actual decease of Jip, her faithful dog, whose growing old is no less focused by Dickens than Doady Purefoy's is by Joyce. The parodistic parallel between the aging dog and the aging husband seems later to be reinforced by Theodore Purefoy being urged with ironical appreciation to "Toil on, labour like a very bandog."35 Joyce's attitude to Dickens is comparable to Picasso's relation to Courbet:</page><page sequence="14">110 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES 1. Both Joyce and Picasso follow their original models with me- ticulous care. Picasso traces Courbet's Young Ladies of the Banks of the Seine from point to point, from detail to detail; even the shoes of the demoiselles are repainted with considerable and, for some, surprising attention. Joyce also imitates the characteristic traits of Dickens's manner of writing in complete factual and sty- listic accuracy. 2. Imitation in both cases is a comic reinterpretation through playful nockery and witty exaggeration done in the spirit of a uni- versal caricature. 3. The target of the irony both in Picasso's caricature of Courbet and in Joyce's parody of Dickens is not simply a particular work or life-work, but the method of 19th-century realism in general. Hence the ironical relativization of the creation of types, of the representa- tion of the particular and the general in a life-like, graphic unity, of the artist's and author's dual ability of identification and criticism. 4. Neither Picasso's comic reinterpretation of Courbet, nor Joyce's ironical re-creation of Dickens stands in isolation. Picasso's carica- tures of Cranach the Elder, Cranach the Younger, El Greco, Velaz- quez, Poussin, Delacroix and Manet are matched by Joyce's parodies of ancient incantations, Latinized mediaeval English prose, Old En- glish alliterative style, Everyman, Mandeville, Malory, Browne, Bun- yan, Pepys, Evelyn, Defoe, Swift, Addison, Steele, Sterne, Goldsmith, Burke, Gibbon, Walpole, Lamb, de Quincey, Landor, Ruskin, Car- lyle, and vulgar modern slang. From the end of the 19th century artistic caricature has been much more than a mere mockery. The fact that the artist is willing and able to adopt and adapt the most diverse forms and to turn them, as it were, inside out also expresses the relativization of forms, norms and social experiences. Besides the testimony of Picasso and Joyce, the pastiches of Proust on Balzac, Flaubert, Sainte-Beuve, Gautier, Faguet, Régnier, Michelet, Renan and Saint Simon; or the literary caricatures of Karinthy on novelists like Defoe, Dickens, Zola, Verne, Wilde, Wells, Lewis, on dramatists like Shakespeare, Rostand, Ibsen, Shaw, Pirandello and O'Neill, as well as on a num- ber of Hungarian poets, novelists and playwrights, also attest to a sense of relativity and a quest for values. 6 A similar tendency is manifest in Picasso's and Joyce's stylistic versatility: their ability to use a number of stylistic trends not only in succession, but also in the same period or - in the case of Ulysses - even in the same work. The simultaneous presence and alternation in Ulysses of Naturalism, Impressionism, Symbolism, Expressionism, Surrealism, and even a linguistic equivalent of Cubism have the con- sequence that a given utterance in a particular stylistic trend often appears, as it were, in quotation marks expressing the relativistic</page><page sequence="15">EGRI 111 changeability of the underlying attitude. Can one unconditionally admire the impressionistic color of the sea if it is both "bluesilver" and "snotgreen"?37 5. Another corollary of parodistic and stylistic many-sidedness is multiple perspective. Courbet still uses a single perspective in depict- ing his Young Ladies of the Banks of the Seine; the view unfolds as it is seen from the position of the painter. The emphasis on the re- liability of his individual observation results in a unified vision, as had been the case since the Renaissance. With Cézanne the absolute trustworthiness of a single viewpoint becomes relativized. Picasso in his reinterpretation of Courbet's Young Ladies applies a multiple perspective, as the spreading out on one plane of the four profiles of the two girls indicates. The feminine becomes contrasted with the female, the face with the mask. The lateral view of a huge shoe is of an equal importance with the side view of a large face. Similarly, Dickens (and Balzac or Mark Twain) still view the world with the single sight of the omniscient author. With Henry James or Marcel Proust the novelist's unified vision becomes weak- ened and the protagonists' specific angles gain in importance. Joyce in Ulysses adopts a multiple perspective. In his Dickens-caricature he ridicules the narrator's omniscience. In Mrs. Purefoy's eyes Doady possesses grave dignity, has fought the good fight, and played loyal- ly his man's part. In the revelling students' view, he is "the remark- ablest progenitor" who did "charge to cover like the transpontine bison."38 Mrs. Purefoy herself becomes from a meek mother a copu- lating cow. The idyllic turns vulgar. Different perspectives, even con- tradictory aspects are flattened out and levelled on the pleine of rela- tive judgment. y 6. The replacement of Courbet's and Dickens's single perspective by Picasso's and Joyce's multiple perspective has increased the need for a pattern in which disorganized phenomena can be reorganized. With Picasso the pattern is supplied by the spatial geometry of Cub- ism and various decorative arrangements; with Joyce it is provided by the compositional schemes of Constructivism. (An intermediary stage can be witnessed in Cezanne's natural views emphasizing geo- metrical forms or Proust's interiorized experiences accentuating temporal and psychological schemes.) In his early review of Ulysses, T.S. Eliot, with the congeniality of the author of The Waste Land, pointed out the significance of Joyce's use of the myth, and his manipulating a continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity, observing that the method "is simply a way of control- ling, of ordering, giving a shape and a significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history. . . . It is ... a step toward making the modern world possible for art."40 The application of the general principle to episode 14 containing</page><page sequence="16">1 1 2 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES the sequence of parodies becomes manifest in Joyce's letter of March 20 (?), 1920 to Frank Budgen: Am working hard at Oxen of the Sun, the idea being the crime com- mitted against fecundity by sterilizing the act of coition. Scene, lying-in hospital. Technique: a nine-parted episode without divisions introduced by a Sallustian-Tacitean prelude (the unfertilized ovum), then by way of earliest English alliterative and monosyllabic and Anglo-Saxon . .. . then by way of Mandeville . . . then Malory's Morte d'Arthur . . . then the Elizabethan chronicle style . . . then a passage solemn, as of Milton, Taylor, Hooker, followed by a choppy Latin- gossipy bit, style of Burton-Browne, then a passage Bunyanesque. after a diary style bit Pepys-Evelyn . . . and so on through Defoe-Swift and Steele-Addison-Sterne and Landor-Pater-Newman until it ends in a frightful jumble of Pidgin English, nigger English, Cockney, Irish, Bowery slang and broken doggerel. This progression is also linked back at each part subtly with some foregoing episode of the day and, besides this, with the natural stages of development in the embryo and the periods of faunal evolution in general. The double-thudding Anglo-Saxon motive recurs from time to time ... to give the sense of the hoofs of oxen. Bloom is the spermatozoon, the hospital the womb, the nurse the ovum, Stephen the embryo. All these schemes have been thoroughly elaborated, have a comic application, and the stylistic parodies are brilliant. Nevertheless, this kind of patterning is no less external to the human scene (the birth of Mrs. Purefoy 's child) than Picasso's ornamental design is in his comic re-creation of Courbe t's Demoiselles. Even the most innocent-looking elements of Joyce's parody on Dickens (itself part of a scheme) are made parts of a multiple pat- tern. When Mrs. Purefoy imagines that along with her new-born baby all her nine children surround her bedside, the enumeration of Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert, Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy and Mortimer Edward, sets the scene for an intimate Dickensian family reunion. The number nine, however, also has a great many structural con- notations. The nine months of embryonic development and the ap- propriate nine biological stages are carefully thrown into relief.42 The episode consists of nine parts. Its introductory section displays a nine-unit division. "The three paragraphs, each with a threefold repetition, form a verbal equivalent for Homer's island of Trinacria, literally Three headlands' or, as it is described in Lamb's Adven- tures of Ulysses, 'having three promontories jutting into the sea.'"43 "By its ninefold pattern," Harry Blamires adds, "this opening con- stitutes one more Angelus-like annunciation."44 When in her letter of June 30, 1920, Harriet Shaw Weaver suggests that The Oxen of the Sun episode might also have been called Hades because its read- ing is like being taken the rounds of hell, Joyce seems to be inter-</page><page sequence="17">EGRI 113 ested in the idea to the point of interpreting it: "Do you mean that the Oxen of the Sun episode resembles Hades because the nine cir- cles of development (enclosed between the headpiece and tailpiece of opposite chaos) seem to you to be peopled by extinct beings?"45 Let us add to this that - with Dr. Dixon having left the assembled drinkers - there happen to be nine ribald revellers in the company when the child is born. It is no less noteworthy that when the nurse, an old acquaintance of Mr. Bloom, opens the door of the Lying-in Hospital in Holies Street, Dublin, to admit Mr. Bloom, we can read the remark: "On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and love- some daughter that then over land and seafloor nine year had long outwandered."46 Theme and treatment are both intellectually, even speculatively interrelated and ingeniously, even cosmically incon- gruous. The factual network of all these references constitutes a Construc- tivist scheme which rearranges the Dickensian family idyll with no less thoroughgoing irony than Picasso's cubistically conceived deco- rative design does Courbe t's natural idyll. Determinism is heavy; cari- cature is universal.47 IV Benjamin Britten's many-faceted oeuvre is also characterized by a marked bent for the humorous, the witty, and sometimes even the caricaturistic. An infant prodigy at the age of five, and a prolific composer throughout his life, he created a long sequence of works in which the humorous sparks of his occasional wit flash. The first of his Three Two-part Songs (1932) is ingeniously grotesque. The last move- ment of his string quartet Alia Quartetto Seriose first played in 1933 is a musical joke [Alia Burlesca). His symphonic cycle Our Hunting Fathers (1936) preserved the satirical touches of Auden's text. So did his sequence of five songs On This Island (1937) and his Three Cabaret Songs (1938), setting Auden's poems to music. The Seven Ages of Man (1938) and Old Spain (1938), Britten's incidental mu- sic to Montagu Slater's one-acters in verse, were presented as a pup- pet show in London. His Canadian Carnival (1939) offers light and merry symphonic entertainment matching the theme of the orches- tral composition. His Introduction and Rondo alia Burlesca (1940) suggests the tone and intention of the piece in its very title. In the cantata Rejoice in the Lamb (1943) the Lord is glorified by all na- tions and creatures - with a pet cat and a mouse included. Part II, No. 3 of his Spring Symphony (1949) intones ironical inflections.48 In the biblical opera Noye's Fludde (1957) Noah's wife is a thorough- ly comical figure; the slap she gives Noah leads to the outbreak of a storm, and the sounds of the raindrops are rendered by cups hit with</page><page sequence="18">1 14 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES wooden spoons. Cantata Academica - Carmen Basiliense (1960) is liberally sprinkled with humorous touches. The Golden Vanity (1966) is a funny vaudeville. At the merry beginning of Britten's serious operatic parable, The Burning Fiery Furnace (1966), two singers and a minstrel entertain the public in a joking spirit. With its social satire and genuine mockery, Britten's version of The Beggar's Opera (1948) is a musical manifestation of a trend caricature, worthy of the spirit of its model, John Gay's musical play of 1728. The most refined expressions of Britten's comic vein and humor- ous wit are his approximations or uses of the category of universal caricature: The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, subtitled Variations and Fugue on a Theme ofPurcell (1945), the comic opera Albert Herring (1947), and the parodistic opera buff a section of A Midsummer-Night's Dream (1960). Originally written for the educational film Instruments of the Or- chestra, Britten's The Young Person 's Guide to the Orchestra is an autonomous and ingenious composition. Among compounds "of vaudeville, musical midway, and didactic consideration known as the 'children's concert,'"4^ Britten's work is of absolute musical value in its own right; it is most effective even without Eric Crozier's inserted commentaries presenting the whole, the sections, and the instruments of the orchestra. Its independence and coherence are created by a playfully ironical mood realized in a four-part structure. The first structural unit contains six thematic statements. Theme A presents Purcell's eloquent and animated tune from Abdelazer, or The Moor's Revenge (1695) sounded by the entire orchestra. Themes B, C, D, and E re-state the original melody as played by the four main sections, the woodwind, the brass, the strings, and the percus- sion groups. The re-statements are also reinterpretations: when Pur- cell's sonorous tunes and harmonious chords are replaced by, and reduced to, the bursting beats of the timpani, the bass drum, the tambourine, the side drum, the cymbal, and the triangle, the result- ing skeletal effect is weirdly grotesque. Theme F brings back Purcell's original melody by the whole orchestra. The second structural unit offers thirteen variations (A-M) focusing individual instruments of the four main orchestral sections in the order of the woodwind, the strings, the brass, and the percussion. In this analytical block of the composition ironic touches are achieved in a number of ways. Each variation highlights a specific technical property of a particular musical instrument and at the same time constitutes an independent phase in the total musical process. The two aspects are inseparably interrelated and even reinforced by a thirteen-fold occurrence. The artistic outcome is the impression of automatism imposed on life: Bergson's definition of the comic.50 The repeated structural configurations in Picasso's remodelling of</page><page sequence="19">EGRI 115 Courbet's Young Ladies, and the process of birth articulated in the technically elaborate parodistic stages of the development of English prose in Ulysses also possess these two facets. Most of the variations tend to convey wittily and exaggerate hu- morously some human qualities, none of which are congruous with the mood of Purcell's theme which they vary. The flutes are impish, the oboes brooding, the violins over-zealous in executing their char- acter variations alia polacca, the harp is gracefully vain and occasion- ally self-complacent, and the trombones, as Imogen Hoist aptly ob- serves, "extract every ounce of enjoyment from the flavour of parody in the sustained marcato of their pompous progress."51 Even the words of the score mark the intention of personification: the harp is called the strings' "cousin," the piccolo the flute's "shrill little bro- ther," and the double-basses are characterized as "the grandfathers of the String family, with heavy, grumbling voices"; the oboes "have a gentle, plaintive quality" and the clarinets "are very agile."52 The degree of instrumental personification not infrequently reaches the level of the imitation of singing. The phenomenon goes far beyond the singable quality of any beautiful tune. Not only the violins sing with enthusiasm, the violas with feeling, and the cellos "with splen- did richness and warmth,"53 but also the clarinets sing with a far- fetched, swaying gaiety, the bassoons with a grimly pompous, mar- tially morose, and belatedly hurt desire, the double-basses with a clumsy, awkward yearning, and even the timpani, yes, the timpani make an honorable, if unsuccessful effort, to sing, being repeatedly and parodistically encouraged by the preparatory insistence and urging accompaniment of the violins and violas, which might very well introduce a grand operatic aria by Verdi or Rossini. (The aria character of an orchestral piece is also very obvious in the fourth variant of Britten's early Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge (1937). Composed "with a wonderful sense of parody", this Aria Italiana is "snide Rossini.")54 The song-like quality of these instru- mental parts amounts to a playfully parodistic vocalization of the orchestra. The broader significance of the phenomenon is finely illuminated by Thomas Mann. In Doktor Fans tus, characterizing his Schoenbergian composer-protagonist's oratorio "Apocalypsis cum figuris," Mann remarks: "Chorus and orchestra are here not clearly separated from each other as symbols of the human and the material world; they merge into each other, the chorus is 'instrumentalized', the orchestra, as it were, 'vocalized', to that degree and to that end that the boundary between man and thing seems shifted."55 Such a shift, a reflection of, or a reaction against, reification and alienation, is also typical of Picasso's and Joyce's creative procedures in which subjectivity is reified and objectivity is subjectivized. Britten's Purcell Variations are also characterized by an excep-</page><page sequence="20">1 1 6 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES tionally strong visual quality which in its turn also becomes one of the sources of merry comedy. Its film version, the Instruments of the Orchestra, "oddly contrives," William Mann notes, "to mirror the visual aspect of each instrument, as well as its technical person- ality. How appropriate, for instance, is the matching of the mighty double-basses with their elephantine phrases."56 Let it be added that the "elephantine phrases" of the double-basses evoke the image of something mighty and clumsy even without seeing the huge in- struments. Similarly, the three-fold cracking of the whip projects the picture of a violent dismissal by its very sound. It is little won- der that the work has attracted choreographers more than once, or that Britten's attention so often turned to the genre of the opera. The third structural unit constitutes a swift and merry pande- monium through an enormous thirteen-entry fugue bringing back all the instruments one by one in the order of their solo variations (A-M). The fourth unit raises further hell by combining the fugue with Purcell's original theme. Sounded by the brazen blare of the horns, trumpets and trombones, and supported by the tuba and the double- basses, the Purcell theme with its grand, magnificent maestoso aug- mentation, solemn, metrically balanced slow procession, and deep, mighty register is melodious and harmonious tradition incarnate. Played by the rest of the orchestra, and punctured by the urchin- like whistle of the piccolo, the insolent shrieks of the flutes, and the merry mockery of the violins, Britten's fugue, with its glowing and glaring construction,57 allegro molto cavalcade, rhythmically labyrinthine syncopation, and whirling, sparkling high register, is impish, impertinent, and impious innovation incarnate. The total impact of this ingenious culmination is the kind of double-edged irony which also characterizes the relationship be- tween Courbet's Young Ladies of the Banks of the Seine and Picas- so's parodistic reinterpretation of the picture; or chapter LIII of Dickens's David Copperfield and Joyce's parody of the Dickensian vein in Ulysses. In all three cases, a mutual relativization and ironi- zation takes place in the pattern of universal caricature.5 8 PETER EGRI • L. Eôtvôs University, Budapest NOTES 1.

Appositional phrases like "loved one of old, faithful lifemate now" marking characteristic features somewhat circumstantially are also typical of Balzac's style and are ridiculed in Proust's pastiche of Balzac.

These "baby fingers" of the Dickens parody are presumably not unrelated to those "little fingers twining round" Doady's "hand!" in the Dickensian original, especially in view of the fact that they belonged to Dora, Doady's "child-wife." 33. Similar qualities are ironically adumbrated in "Kopperffy David," a caricature on Dickens's David Copperfield in Igy iftok ti (This is the Way You Write), Budapest: Athen- aeum, 1921, II. pp. 84-6, by the Hungarian humorist Frigyes Karinthy. Karinthy, however, also emphasizes Dickens's habit of repeating certain characteristic traits of his figures, his interest in the grotesquely eccentric, and his being a British author, a feature which an- other British author like Joyce is less susceptible to, even if he is Irish. 34.

The fact that both Picasso and Joyce created works belonging to the category of universal caricature does not, of course, mean that the two artists are in every respect alike. Picasso's social commitment made it possible for him to do trend caricatures and non-ironical representational works as well. The difference is also manifest in Joyce's light and Picasso's serious treatment of the Minotaur myth in Ulysses (p. 538) and in pictures like Young Girl with Minotaur (1934-5) or Minotauromachy (1935), respectively. Guernica (1937) is unimaginable without Picasso's anti-fascism, Dove (1949) without his involvement in the peace movement, Massacre in Korea (1951) without his leftist humanism. Neverthe- less, his stance and method do show significant convergences with those of Joyce. The Joycean view of history has its partial parallel with at least a period of Picasso's ideas of the same. "History," Stephen Dedalus said, "is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake" (Ulysses, p. 42). "There ought to be an absolute dictatorship of painters," Picasso observed, "a dictatorship of one painter - to suppress all who have betrayed us, to sup- press . . . history But common sense always gets away with it. Above all let's have a revolution against that!" "They should put out the eyes of painters, as they do to gold- finches to make them sing better." (Quoted in John Berger's The Success and Failure of Picasso, p. 32. For Picasso's later position, see Berger, p. 177.) 48. Cf.

In his orchestral suites Soirées Musicales (1936) and Matinees Musicales (1941) Britten orchestrated melodies by Rossini. In his Soirées Musicales, "except for orchestration, the Rossini originals are fundamentally untouched. Both the Swiss movement ('Tirolese') and the Spanish evocation ('Bolero') take on humorous twists" (A. Cohn, p. 57). 55. Thomas Mann, Doctor Faustus. Translated by H.T. Lowe-Forter, (London: Seeker and Warburg, 1949), p. 375. While in Britten's Les Illuminations for Tenor or Soprano Solo and String Orchestra (1939), "the orchestra of strings becomes an instrumental chorus" (A. Cohn, p. 64), in his Hymn to St. Cecilia (1942) "especially appealing are the varied colors</page><page sequence="24">120 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES of the voices, to a degree imitative of instrumental timbres, plus a scherzo section that is as close to light string instrument style as a chorus can achieve" (A. Cohn, p. 66). 56. William Mann, The Incidental Music," in Donald Mitchell and Hans Keller (eds.), Benjamin Britten, p. 300. 57. Among the various patterns he used in Ulysses, Joyce also adopted the organizing form and force of the fugue: the technique of episode 11 (Sirens) is fuga per canonem. 58. A typological convergence is, of course, no strict identity. Britten's innovations are not so radical as Picasso's or Joyce's, or for that matter, as Schoenberg's, Berg's and Webern's. He does make use of the twelve-note system in works like The Turn of the Screw (1954) or partly in A Midsummer-Night's Dream (1960), but his ties with popu- lar and traditional music are not severed. Therefore, in his universal caricatures he not infrequently tends to retain the traditional plasticity of molding from the outside, while he ironizes it from the inside. In this his Purcell Variations resemble Prokofiev's Classical Symphony, "Parody," Donald Mitchell observes, "is one of Britten's major gifts," but his parodies show the ambiguity of emotional association and disassociation in a similar way to the attitude of a child who makes fun of his parents by imitation. (Donald Mitchell, "The Musical Atmosphere," in Donald Mitchell and Hans Keller, eds., Benjamin Britten, p. 11.) Britten's Purcell realizations (with Dido and Aeneas included) bear witness to his understanding and appreciation of his great predecessor. The outer elaboration and inner ironization of traditional forms are also conspicuous in Britten's comic open Albert Herring (1947). The source of the comic effect is not simply the theme of the opera (Maupassant's short story "Le Rosier de Madame Husson" adapted by Eric Grozier) or its characterization, but also the ironization, through exag- geration and incongruity, of the generic form itself. The opera displays solo aria, duet, trio, quartet, even nonet, indeed all the paraphernalia of the traditional opera in such a far-fetched manner that the effect is uproariously comical. In Act II, Scene 1, ensemble recitatives are contrapuntally interwoven. When Sid, the butcher's assistant, pours rum into Albert's lemonade, the latter's awakening erotic interest is rendered by a parodistic quotation of the potion chord from Wagner's Tristan. Caricature is coupled with self- caricature: when Police Superintendent Budd is talking about rape, a motif is heard from Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia (1946). Simple words (like "We paid three and six" in Act III) are rendered by an elaborate musical structure. Cf. Hans Keller, The Rape of Lucretia, Albert Herring (London: Boosey and Hawkes, 1947), pp. 21, 27, 28, 32; Eric Walter White, Benjamin Britten: His Life and Operas (London: Faber and Faber, 1948, Part II, Ch. 4); Donald Mitchell, "The Musical Atmosphère^' in Donald Mitchell and Hans Keller, Benjamin Britten, pp. 24, 34-5, 46-7; Norman Del Mar, "Albert Herring," ibid., pp. 148, 150, 156, 160, 161; Lennox Berkeley, "The Light Music," ibid., p. 291; Eric Crozier, "Albert Herring - Arbeit am Libretto," in Dr. Heinrich Lindlar, éd., Musik der Zeit: Benjamin Britten, Das Oppernwerk (Bonn: Verlag Boosey and Hawkes, 1955), pp. 43-5. In Britten's opera A Midsummer-Night's Dream, the fairies sing in an impressionistic- ally veiled dissonant style; the lovers in repeated, merry solo-phrases and recitatives snatched from each other's lips; and the artisans in the finale in the strictly harmonic, parodied and itemized idiom of Donizetti, Rossini and Verdi.
