<plain_text><page sequence="1">SLAVE CYBORGS AND THE BLACK INFOVIRUS: ISHMAEL REED'S CYBERNETIC AESTHETICS Michael A. Chaney There has been an alarming scarcity of critical work on the intersection of race and technology in contemporary literature, a concern that Amiri Baraka poses in Kawaida as a question of interga lactic mobility: "What are the black purposes of space travel?" (31). Hazarding an answer, Robert Fox invokes Ishmael Reed to deploy a hasty analogy—"It is not simply a matter of replacing flights to Canada with flights to the stars" (94)—but then Fox qualifies his witticism, without completing his train of thought, in a parenthetical musing that attests to Reed's more complicated relationship to technology: "although it is worth recalling that Reed's Raven makes his journey on a 747; technology does get you there—but where?" (94). What began as a tidy example of an unsophisticated use of technology, Ishmael Reed's Flight to Canada (1976), ultimately leads to an ad mission of greater ambiguity that disables the very enterprise of theorizing Reed's technology. Indeed, as Robert Fox's rhetorical apo ria suggests, attempting to make Reed synonymous with simplistic notions of technology (Fox points to radio and early film) soon leads to more questions. Alongside a thorough critical record on Reed's "HooDoo" aesthetics, postmodern conventionality, slave narrative revisions, and pop cultural allusions, one finds, by contrast, a dearth of criticism dealing with Reed's use of technology.

Chaney</page><page sequence="2">262 Ishmael Reed's Cybernetic Aesthetics misrecognize Reed for a writer less aware of technology than say, Samuel Delaney, an argument that Fox goes on to make. This paper works toward a series of possible answers to the question that Fox's discarded analogy ends with—where does tech nology lead to in Flight to Canada? And of course this "where" may indicate not so much a physical space as a reorientation in subjectiv ity. But before we hypothesize the implications of Reed's technicity we must come to an agreement on what kind of technology pre dominates in his texts. Fox historicizes Reed's primary concern with radio as a way to figuratively banish Reed and his fiction to a histori cal era less interpenetrated by commodification and what we might now refer to as telepresence communications technologies: "The in fluence of radio on Baraka and Reed, however, is worth reemphasiz ing because it roots them in a pre-McLuhanite era, a fact that distin guishes them from younger artists who have grown up in a far more saturated media environment" (93). Fox interprets Reed's focus on radio, film, and television as criteria excluding him from more recent black authors such as Samuel Delaney. Such periodizing induces Fox to associate Reed with an earlier, implicitly ineffectual form of postmodernism that J. Hoberman describes as "the genuinely popu list, sixties post-modernism of Pop Art and underground movies" (68). To Fox and other critics who hierarchicize creativity within a phases-of-commodity matrix à la Marshall McLuhan and Jean Baudrillard, Reed's radio metaphors are, at best, prototypical refer ences to information viruses, and at worst, nostalgic pleas for a re turn to precommodity culture. This myopic highlighting of radio as technology manqué disregards Reed's subtle interlacing of technolo gies more contiguous with the 1990s than the 1970s. In what follows I will explore Reed's fascination, apparent since Mumbo Jumbo (1972), with African-American culture as a viral form of information that eventually causes an imperialist crisis of commu nication control (cybernetics) and his analogy between two kinds of hybrids in Flight To Canada—the man-machine cyborg represented by Uncle Robin and the animal-man hybridizing of slaves by proslavery apologists. The critical trope of the cyborg allows us to figuratively rescue Reed's works from the kind of critical determinism already demonstrated in Fox. Read alongside Reed's fictional instantiation of the slave-cyborg, Donna Haraway's Utopian cyborg and Harryette Mullen's dystopian media cyborg enable a critical approach that per mits temporary hold on Reed's elusive fiction without flattening its multifaceted aesthetic or foreclosing its various contextual affinities.</page><page sequence="3">Chaney 263 The Cyborg: Donna Haraway and Harryette Mullen When critics refer to the cyborg, the reading most often alluded to is Donna Haraway's now famous essay "A Cyborg Manifesto," which defines the fused embodiment of human and machine. Her argu ment celebrates the revolutionary disruption to traditional catego ries of being that the cyborg entails, restructuring relations of power not according to models of embodiment presuming difference as in feriority, but to models of communication and control that reinter pret power as a problem of cybernetics coding: "a search for a com mon language in which all resistance to instrumental control disappears, and all heterogeneity can be submitted to disassembly, reassembly, investment, and exchange" (164). By modeling "a kind of disassembled and reassembled, postmodern collective and per sonal self" (163), Haraway's cyborg comes to represent, as Viviane Casimir explains, a "new 'ontological' space that anyone can occupy" (278). Therefore, in spite of its origin in traditional technocultural systems of repression and control, or the "scary new networks" of power dubbed by Haraway as the "informatics of domination" (161), the cyborg nonetheless locates resistance within emergent technolo gies by shifting traditional boundaries between human and machine and by outmoding concepts of gender and racial difference. Casimir contends that cyborg anthropology and politics, which privilege the blurring of dichotomies and the deconstruction of bina ries, also signal a "crisis in postmodern thought" and further threaten to reinstall "Cartesian and Newtonian epistemology, where the entity 'human organism' reappropriates the center, the logos, the transcen dental through an anthropomorphism" (279). For Casimir, as well as for Mary Ann Doane, Haraway's initially subversive cyborg has come to occupy a new hegemonic space in critical theory that values hy bridity as the new subjectivity of power. Doane especially qualifies that the cyborg is only subversive in relation to the dualistic regimes of social structure to which it is a direct reaction. In other words, these theorists register a fear that, out of the reassembled wreckage of the post-humanoid cyborg, a new version of the "human" will emerge that reprises familiar hierarchies of embodiment—this time, along lines of technological adaptability. A more compelling extrapolation of Haraway's cyborg is offered by Harryette Mullen's "media cyborg." In her assessment of passing literature, Mullen discovers a twentieth-century by-product of Jim Crow segregation and tragic mulatta fiction in fantasies of techno logical miscegenation. Her media cyborg names a disturbing meta phor for the technological amalgamation of identities coded as black but visibly represented as white, a racial alloy produced through "technological grafting of white body and black soul through the</page><page sequence="4">264 Ishmael Reed's Cybernetic Aesthetics mechanical synchronization of filmic image and soundtrack" (84). The media cyborg thus recycles the thematics of passing, assimila tion, miscegenation, and invisibility found in tragic mulatta novels (84). Unlike Haraway's cyborg, which is ideally able to occupy a radi cal new subject position by denaturing both of its constitutive terms (the human and the machine), Mullen's cyborg underscores the way in which a particular term is always favored even after hybridizing "ontic" binaries, in this case not merely human and machine but also black and white. Assimilation is equated with cyborgization in Mullen's view, and the media cyborg always entails a production of whiteness: "assimilation is unimaginable without miscegenation, whether sexual or mechanical-cybernetic: assimilation equals whiteness produced from the resources and raw materials of blackness" (77). In opposition to Haraway's unremitting optimism, Mullen assails visual media tech nologies that privilege exteriority over interiority and make possible the kind of media-manufactured racial splicing that Mumbo Jumbo also critiques. As we shall see, the same concern for theorizing the con sequences of cyborg anthropology occurs in the novels of Ishmael Reed. Reeding the Cyborg and Racist Technological Rhetoric Critics have long noted Reed's distortions of temporality, his rearranging of chronology and desegregation of symbols from usual contexts. In addition to these displacements, Reed occasionally per plexes the physical process of reading itself. One famous example occurs in Mumbo Jumbo where printed text suddenly shifts to hand writing that loops concentrically around a picture, requiring the reader to turn the book to follow the spiraling text. Given Reed's penchant for defamiliarizing the act of reading, it is strange that so few critics have suggested a reverse reading for Flight to Canada—that is, a reading of the novel that begins with what could loosely be called the plot's apex. After the deceased master Arthur Swille III wills his es tate to his faithful slave Uncle Robin, Robin informs the novel's pro tagonist, Raven Quickskill, a tricksterish slave turned fugitive poet, how he was able to ensure such an unusual inheritance. Rather than benefiting from a shift in the imperialistic logic of the master, Robin attributes the amazing transfer of possession to a momentous shift in slave ontogeny: Well, if they [whites] are not bound to respect our rights, then I'll be damned if we should respect theirs. Fred Douglass said the same thing. Well, anyway, Swille had something called dyslexia. Words came to him scrambled and jumbled. I became his reading and writing. Like a com</page><page sequence="5">Chaney 265 puter, only this computer left itself Swille's whole estate. Property joining forces with property. I left me his whole estate. I'm it, too. Me and it got more it. (171) Reading back from this point we may plot the course of Uncle Robin's hybridization, his trajectory from a slave, a scientifically defined man thing, to a man-machine, an amalgamation of man and computer, the entity Donna Haraway celebrates as the cyborg. Of course, ideological entanglements of technology and race are nothing new. Proslavery ideology conceptualizes so-called infe rior races as functional commodities dehumanized to the status of mere tools. Reed's use of the computer as a metonym for the power politics of slavocratic society may also reflect a commonplace re course in proscience literature, which assuaged patriarchal anxieties regarding a technological revolution that was then unfolding along side the Civil Rights and feminist movements by presaging the new age in technology in terms of a return to the age of slavery. Brim ming with technological optimism, David Rorvik's "Slaves or Mas ters?" (which originally appeared in P/ayboy 'm 1969) heralds a techno cybernetic future in which the computer's ascendancy to global power and technology's potential subversion of patriarchal structures are counteracted by a return to the power dynamics of plantation sla very. A racist subtext underwrites Rorvik's hyperbolic rhetoric of tri umphal technological change as the article tantalizes its presump tive white male reader with the prospect of being both supplanted and served by a computer that is metaphorized throughout as a "minority entity [. . .] making a phenomenal ascent" (3). The minor ity-computer's move up the social ladder from private, behind-the scenes arenas of servitude to more public "front desk jobs" causes "even the courageous," says Rorvik in an aside, "to get nervous" (3). Quelling this anxiety are terms of domestication ("well trained") and taming ("properly programmed"), familiar tropes of imperialism. More soothing to the patriarch's ego is the computer's ability to function in the service of the master's desire and to extend his domination over female subjects: "A computer instructed to lie under certain circum stances ('I'm sorry, Mrs. Smith, but your husband is tied up in a conference right now') can be counted on to do so with a perfectly 'straight face'" (3). Even the jobs that computerized robots perform in the master's house, "humble doorman, guard, cook, bottle washer, chambermaid, grounds keeper" (Rorvik 3), align them with traditional black figures circumscribed within the space of white domesticity. Rorvik goes on to note that later incarnations of the domestic computer will simu late chess partners, but assures that they will also be programmed to lose: "It would be 'uppity,' to say the least, to win all the time—</page><page sequence="6">266 Ishmael Reed's Cybernetic Aesthetics particularly so soon after discarding the apron, the dustcloth, and the dishtowel" (3). The humble manner by which the computer rises to power offers a point of contrast between post civil rights "uppity" blacks and servile forms of technology. Rorvik implies that the com puter is a slave that knows its place, and his article exemplifies the extent to which the discourse of technology was and still is imbri cated within discourses of race, civil rights, and slavery. Technology as a trope is only a piece of the puzzle. Informa tion, literacy, and language also play important roles in both the slave narrative genre and Reed's comical re-writing of it in Flight To Canada. Central to Robin's cyborg transformation is the problem of decoding information. Since the master, Arthur Swille, cannot effec tually re-organize the code of language, Robin takes over the job for him. In the process, he becomes Swille's "reading and writing" and literally embodies both the master's text and the machinery for pro cessing such a text. In an interesting rewriting of the African-Ameri can spiritual-preaching tradition of "takin' a text," Reed embeds this moment of Robin's becoming an "it" in the politics of the antebellum slave narrative and the disturbing equation between stolen bodies and stolen texts that opens the novel. Whereas Josiah Henson and countless other slaves had their texts stolen by white editors and greedy hacks eager to cash in on the abolitionist sponsored sensa tionalism of slavery, Robin celebrates his transformation from body to text, from commodity subject to commodity computer. To say, however, that Robin changes from a state of possessive subjectivity (of owning himself) to being a possession no longer owned, only partly delineates this "man" to computer transformation. To be sure, Robin suggests that he now occupies a hybridized subjectivity that decenters normative identity—but what, or better yet, whose nor mative identity? Robin is not post-human, but post-slave. Before focusing on Robin's terminal identity as a computer, an instrumentalized property cybernetically replicating itself, we must first reveal his initial identity as a slave in relation to both Reed's colorful cast of alternative slave subjects and the slave as a historical subject, which Reed's fiction notoriously problematizes. What is a Negro? Between No-Thing and Ur-Thing Finding the historical slave ensnared in a sprawling web of con tradictory discourses, legal, religious, economic, scientific, and fic tional, Hortense Spillers defines slavery as "the most textualized and discursive field of practice that we could posit as a structure for at tention. [It is] primarily discursive, as we search vainly for a point of absolute and indisputable origin, for a moment of plenitude that would</page><page sequence="7">Chaney 267 restore us to the real, rich 'thing' itself before discourse touched it [...] the circle of mystery is recircumscribed time and again" (29). Despite these Derridean warnings of indeterminacy, however, Spillers goes on to limn some aspects of the slave as a historical subject that seem to prove stable, "its" persistent border crossings and category shifts between poles of identity. What gives rise to slavery's consummate performance of différance— its vertiginous oscillations of signification—are its historical (dare we say originary) gestures toward transience, miscegenation, and hybridity. These gestures transformed the historical practice of slavery and the ontos of slavehood, even in its day, into elusive discursive structures marked by what Spillers calls "terrifying intimacies" between traditional bi naries of public-private (28), nature-culture, work-family, self-other, property-owner, and human-animal. So complete are slavery's dis cursive bivalences that, "from one angle," according to Spillers, sla very "loses visibility" (28). In proslavery discourses, however, the black slave visibly rep resents an ever-shifting confluence of humanoid, animal, property, and tool, and yet, such parsing is superfluous, since these compo nents inhere already in that overdetermined appellation "slave." In his infamous "Notes on the State of Virginia," Thomas Jefferson ex pounds on the permanent moral and physical distinctions that sup port his "suspicion" that "blacks, whether originally a distinct race, or made distinct by time and circumstances, are inferior to whites in the endowments of both body and mind" (937). Master Swille ech oes Jefferson's polygenesist suspicions: "They're not like us, Mr. Lin coln. You said so yourself that there are physical differences" (37). This presumption of the slave as a kind of manimal would later be come an axiom of "American School" ethnological science. Mid-cen tury works by Louis Aggasiz, Josiah Nott, and George Morton1 objec tify blackness and other "inferior races" as fields of anthropological and anthropometric inquiry, a pseudoscience that Reed satirizes in references to Dr. Samuel Cartwright's disease "Dysaethesia Aethipica" (18), a term that Uncle Robin ironically must pronounce for the dys lexic Master Swille as the pathological condition causing Stray Leechfield, 40s, and Raven Quickskill to run away. This notion of hybrid animality is central to a comparison of Donna Haraway's cyborg and Reed's slave characters. Since cyborg anthropology foregrounds ruptures in the boundaries of the subject as a socio-political manifestation of counter-hegemonic subversion, we may describe the cyborg as the latest in a series of boundary transgressions that began with the category disputations over the black body in America, between what constituted human and ani mal: "The cyborg appears in myth precisely where the boundary</page><page sequence="8">268 Ishmael Reed's Cybernetic Aesthetics between human and animal is transgressed" (Haraway 152). One way of reading Haraway's cyborg myth, therefore, is as a theoretical abstraction of African-American slave subjectivity. Along with the dehumanization of Africans, antebellum dis courses simultaneously infantalized slaves, veiling the plantation constellations of power with sentiment. Swille's deployment of the rhetoric of slavery as domesticity punctuates much of the irony sur rounding the character of Uncle Robin, whose pervasive control in the plantation's operation is also made invisible through paternalis tic rhetoric. Reed captures the contradictions of proslavery discourse as Swille, who depends upon Robin to read everything from Dr. Cartwright's theories to Lincoln's "Compensatory Emancipation," pro nounces blacks to be a "childish race" in "need of someone to guide them through this world of woe or they'll hurt themselves" (37). Proslavery theories of black inferiority mask the plantation "reali ties" of the managerial centrality of black labor and control. Noting that most "employees" are not allowed to use the telephone, for example, Swille states, "I permit Uncle Robin to use it because he's such a simple creature, he wouldn't have the thought powers for using it deviously. He's been in the house so long that he's lost his thirst for pagan ways and is as good a gentleman as you or me" (34). Thus, at the outset of Flight To Canada, Reed insinuates the slave in an ever-shifting ideology, configured between a scientific discourse that posits the Negro as an inferior animal and a historical plantation practice that relies upon the Negro as the essential driv ing force of operations. An exaggerated example of this is Mammy Barracuda's role as the puppet master of Mrs. Swille, who resigns so much agency to Mammy that the plantation mistress no longer con trols her own bodily movements. Reed's protean inscription of the slave as domestic help, familial child, and agrarian tool is co-consti tuted alongside disavowed qualities of the slave as shadow master, gentleman, and wielder of spirits and literacy. Such fluid topogra phies of identity do not posit for the Negro any of that essentialized nature normally associated with Enlightenment models of the liberal human subject. Reed's fiction underscores that the slave as a discur sive subject never obtains essential fixity. In Flight to Canada, as in history's discursive genealogy, we witness the "Negro" in America ascend into a matrix of cultural fields as a subject whose natural boundaries and rhetorical affiliations remain in taxonomic flux. There fore, when Uncle Robin shifts from slave to cyborg, he is not moving from human to hybrid, but from one kind of hybrid to another—a kind of positive evolution toward greater specificity. Uncle Robin's is not the only evolution presented in the novel, however, and we must not fail to recognize the curious exactitude</page><page sequence="9">Chaney 269 with which Reed dramatizes particular postslave subjectivities in co ordination with specific discursive moments in proslavery definitions of Africanicity. Stray Leechfield's postslave mode of survival and re sistance, for example, espouses an amalgamation of the slave's sta tus as both a commodity and a purportedly hypersexualized crea ture. He becomes a celebrity of interracial pornography and thus owns himself by selling (out to) the myth of black sexuality: "I bought myself with the money with which I sell myself. If anybody is going to buy and sell me, it's going to be me" (73). Rather than passion ately disproving stereotypes of Africanity as does Raven, Stray's ironic method of subversion involves an impudent performance of exactly those attributes that debase the larger community of slaves. Reed critiques more than the lack of options available to blacks during reconstruction in his portrait of Stray, who reflects a late-twentieth century obsession for celebrity as a means of escaping collectivity. "I not only ran away from the Master, but from the slaves too," says Leechfield, "Sometimes it was hard for me to tell the difference" (177). Undergirding Stray's anti-intellectual philosophy of guerilla capitalism and image production is a denial of community in favor of the same standards of amoral economic individualism that drove slavery: "What I am doing is something 'we did it' can't do, unless we did it one at a time" (74). But despite Stray's professed non-compliance with the kind of philosophical subversions emanating from what he scoffingly calls "the living room of ideas" (177), his image functions as a catalyst of ideological revolution for the slave population even before he sells it for prurient purposes. Interestingly, his subjectivity is also described in part by a metaphor of communications technology. Raven tells him, "you were our greased lightning, our telegraph wire, our wing heeled Legba, warning the woodsmen and the rootmen about Barra cuda and Cato's plan to replace all of the cults with one [... ] the Jesus cult" (75-76). Just as Raven becomes the poem and Robin becomes Swille's "reading and writing," Leechfield here embodies the slaves' "intricate grapevine" through which, as Swille complains, "they pass codes to one another, and some of them have taken to writing" (34). Although Leechfield sets out only to mass-market his image through mail order, his memory works as a form of collective communication, transmitting the will to resist repressive ideologies, exposing slavery's informatics of domination as "A world of lords, ladies, and slaves" (177), and infecting slaves like a form of Hoodoo possession. If Uncle Robin loosely represents a postslave who embraces the property or "thing" component of the man-thing binomial com monly invoked as a heuristic toward defining the slave, then Raven points to a postslave subjectivity determined to perform or self-identify</page><page sequence="10">270 Ishmael Reed's Cybernetic Aesthetics with the "man" pole of the definition, which Thomas Jefferson fa mously stakes out along an axis of cultivated literacy or poetry: "But never yet could I find that a black uttered a thought above the level of plain narration. [. . .] Misery is often the parent of the most affect ing touches in poetry.—Among the blacks is misery enough, God knows, but no poetry" (188-89). The successful use or performance of a specific kind of literacy, therefore, functions for Jefferson as an enabling technology that inherently separates Euramerican "man" from his subordinates as a cordon sanitaire already working to trans port the slave, at least at the level of textuality, "beyond the reach of mixture" (193). Upon learning that Raven's poem is not autobio graphical, one of the slave catchers of Nebraska Tracers Inc. refers to this principle of exclusion via poetry, saying, "They have poetic abilities just like us. They're not literal-minded as Mr. Jefferson said" (63). Echoing Jefferson, Master Swille refers to literacy with a capital "L" as he explains its power to Lincoln with the help of an anachro nism that yokes nineteenth-century writing to late-twentieth-cen tury technology: "And the worst betrayal of all was Raven Quickskill [. . .]. We gave him Literacy, the most powerful thing in the pre technological pre-post-rational age—and what does he do with it? Uses it like that old Voodoo—that old stuff the slaves mumble about" (35-36). Like Frederick Douglass, Raven's cultivation of literacy, his appropriation of the dominant class's technology of literacy, stands as a direct denial of the charge of subhumanity, but the pursuit of this denial consequently forces the slave turned poet into a cultural milieu defined by imperial logics. Cyborg Writing: Postslaves and the "Pre-Technological Pre-Post-Rational" There are interesting intersections between Haraway's cyborg and antebellum American slave subjectivities. Reed's Uncle Robin anticipates and helps to illustrate and explain Donna Haraway's cy borg, who, like the hard-wired Uncle Robin of the end of Flight to Canada, occupies multiple subject positions at once. As a cyborg Uncle Robin literalizes, according to Haraway, existence in a Post Fordist hyperreality and offers a useful "fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and an imaginative resource suggesting some very fruitful couplings" (150). As a postslave, he is not a new master but the "master of a dead man's house" (178). He and Aunt Judy cannot simply insert themselves into a lifestyle set up for white slave mas ters even though Robin has engineered just such an insertion in the discursive space of the will, reflecting exactly the kind of "house hold" revolution that Haraway theorizes: "the cyborg defines a tech</page><page sequence="11">Chaney 271 nological polis based partly on a revolution of social relations in the oikos, the household" (151). Reed's eclectic historical play may be symptomatic of the mul tiplicity that Haraway attributes to the hydra-headed cyborg: "The political struggle is to see from both perspectives. [. . .] Single vision produces worse illusions than double vision or many headed-mon sters. Cyborg unities are monstrous and illegitimate" (154). Cyborg aesthetics foster a desacralization of indivisibility in which no time period is ideologically incongruous with another. History may also be seen as a tool for what Haraway calls cyborg writing, often including "stories, retold stories, versions that reverse and displace hierarchi cal dualisms of naturalized identities. In retelling origin stories, cy borg authors subvert central myths of origin of Western culture" (175). In Reed's transhistorical cyborg fantasy, "Massa Swille" is both the figurehead of slavocratic power (the master's will or desire) and the medium through which that domination replicates itself (the master's legal will and testament). Swille is the embodied master— the third inheritor of a name and an estate on a previous will, as well as the disembodied document itself—the pivotal text in a textual system that depends upon the equivalency of bodies (mastery/prop erty) and writing (laws/signatures). Thus, Swille begins in the novel as a composite entity seemingly inseparable from the legal docu ment that writes him into being. Man and document, texts and body are "Etheric Doubles" of each other. The will is a kind of feedback loop ensuring the stability of slavery's technologies, replicating a cycle of ownership that always posits a master and a collection of property. In a dizzying overlay of instrumentalizations, the will con figures the master not as man but text, while the inscriptions of the master's will (writing) and its products (property, slaves) all merge in the character of Uncle Robin, whose incorporation of the master's literacy reconfigures him as both a postslave cyborg and as "master of a dead man's house." Such cyborg transformations help define a postmodern aesthetics of reflexivity and cybernetic recursion. N. Katherine Hayles defines reflexivity as "the movement whereby that which has been used to generate a system is made, through a changed perspective, to become part of the system it generated (8). Hence, literacy or information processing transmutates Robin, Raven, and Stray into intelligent machines, reconfiguring them as a poem, a computer, and a telegraph wire respectively. In each case the postslave embodies the material substrate carrying information. And although Raven speaks of his writing as always catching up to him as if it were separately anthropomorphized, the information-substrate Cartesianism of machines that Reed con-fuses in his postslaves im plies that they have become the very information that they were meant only to construct.</page><page sequence="12">272 Ishmael Reed's Cybernetic Aesthetics An integral irony in all of this, as Hortense Spillers has shown, links the slave as a commodity to the slave's narrative, not just as a nineteenth-century commodity but as a lucrative subject matter for Reed as well. Moreover, we should not fail to recognize the commod ity affinities between antebellum slaves and modern computers. The laborer in Reed's fantasy begins as a commodity, incarnates produc tion machinery, and ends as an autonomous commodity reifying the circularity of the complete system of production except for the bour geoisie, the captain of industry who lingers on even in Robin's new cyborg habitat as a ghost in the machine—the owner of property (including himself) still marked by former ownership. Reed thus presents an interesting paradox regarding the knowability of slavery. His bedeviling of traditional chronologies seems to suggest that history, like African-American subjectivity, resists solid recuperation or narration. On the other hand, Reed also presents slavery as that which essentializes African Americans. Slavery, in Reed, defies discursivity and ahistoricity in its inexpurgatable reification of African-American lived social relations. Both tendencies are at work in Reed's fictions. Questions over the ambivalence of black essentialism and the possibility of interiority for African Americans unfold differently in Mumbo Jumbo (1972), which explicitly references information tech nologies and human-machine organisms. Its opening pages brilliantly mime the cinematic technique of presenting a dramatic prologue before the titles "roll"—small wonder that Reed calls this novel a "movie book." In some ways, beginning this discussion with Flight to Canada makes sense in that we must talk about postslave subjectivities, albeit in an admittedly historically mixed universe, before we may talk about Mumbo Jumbo's Harlem Renaissance Afri can Americans who inhabit an equally synchronic temporality meld ing ancient Egypt with 1920's America while reflecting the 1970's Black Arts movement. In the following analysis, I examine the way two particular tropes in Mumbo Jumbo—les Grew and the Talking Android—construct cybernetic codification of bodies as pattern and cyborgizable hybridity, thereby creating a tension between bodies and the various disembodied codes working to program them. In this interplay of bodies and codes, Reed sets up a familiar indetermi nacy regarding pure ontologies of race and religion. Jes Grew: Blackness as Disembodied Infovirus Looking for Body-Texts Mumbo Jumbo opens as the mayor of New Orleans learns from a medical team that the arcanum known as Jes Grew has become</page><page sequence="13">Chaney 273 pandemic, infecting hosts with an uncontrollable urge to dance and speak in tongues. Reed borrows the intertextual phrase Jes Grew from James Weldon Johnson, from a description of Topsy in Uncle Tom's Cabin, in order to account for the unassisted but sprawling growth of Black music such as spirituals and Ragtime. In the wake of Jes Grew's overwhelming transformative powers, ancient secret so cieties prepare for battle, each one representing not simply opposing races and cultures but histories as well. In the fray Reed pits Europe ans against Africans. The European coalition is made up of Masons, Teutonic Knights, the Wallflower Order, and Atonists headed by the villainous Hinckle Von Vampton (a satiric portrayal ofthat white pa tron of Harlem Renaissance art, Carl Van Vechten) who controls mulatto President Harding and intends to distract blacks by creating a Talking Android. Against them is a team of black religious leaders and Jes Grew carriers made up of the Hoodoo priest (houngan) PaPa LaBas (Legba) who "carries Jes Grew in him like most other folk carry genes" (23), the mystic Black Herman, the militant Muslim Abdul Sufi Hamid (Malcom X), who is murdered as he attempts to translate the Text of Jes Grew, and a motley crew of younger practi tioners of the "Work" who restore stolen subaltern art to their origi nal people. From the outset Jes Grew conflates virological associations with information, transmissions of black culture, blackness itself, and Hoodoo possession. "We decoded this coon mumbo jumbo" informs one medical expert, "It's nothing we can bring into focus or catego rize; once we call it 1 thing it forms into something else" (4). Without uniformity, causality, or observable pattern, Jes Grew recodes people of all races to behave according to a mysterious programming asso ciated with ancient primitivism, Africanicity, jazz music, bacchanalia, and Voodoo possession. Louis Armstrong describes it in a quote ac companying an inserted picture of a mixed group of late 1960s youth doing the twist: "The spirit hits them and they follow/' (7). As in a Hoodoo ritual the assimilating force of Jes Grew causes one to ex hibit a trance-like frenzy between possession and celebration, trans forming the worshipper into a host, or horse, for a loa. Though Euro peans carry a "saving Virus" counteracting its power, even they are powerless against "Jes Grew's Communicability" (18). Reed draws on metaphors of writing and programming to de scribe this possession, comparing Jes Grew with an essence, a pure cognition or ontos that seeks materiality in the embodied code of language. LaBas explains that Jes Grew is searching for a body or a text: "It's up to its Text. For some, it's a disease, a plague, but in fact it is an anti-plague f. . .]. Being an anti-plague I figure that it's yearning for The Work of its Word or else it will peter out as in the 1890s, when it wasn't ready and had no idea where to search. It</page><page sequence="14">274 Ishmael Reed's Cybernetic Aesthetics must find its Speaking or strangle upon its own ineloquence" (33— 34). LaBas suggests a cybernetic interpretation of Jes Grew, seeing it is a message without a material substrate, a randomness seeking expression in a symbol system or pattern. The crisis in communica tion represented here is the obverse of that which begins Flight to Canada: instead of a text being stolen from its original host, as when Stowe steals Josiah Henson's "Etheric Double" or "gris-gris" (8), we have a master text, Jes Grew, a preliterate code, seeking textual expression in a multitude of hosts; the text is stealing hosts, as it were. As part of its syncretic equipage, the novel incorporates a diz zying range of heteroglossia, operating on several registers and epito mizing what Hayles calls an information narrative, which are texts showing a displacement of the traditional presence/absence binary in favor of a pattern/randomness formation: "the peculiarity of pat tern in these texts is its interpénétration with randomness and its implied challenge to physicality" (35). Reed draws attention to the manner in which his novel constructs information, as it disrupts tra ditional reading practices and flouts genre expectations. Adding to a startling array of extra-novelistic devices, photographs, diagrams, newspaper clippings, radio voice-overs, Reed includes scholarly foot notes, as in the cryptograph from Charles Edward Amory's The Con quest of Epidemic Disease, and appends a "partial bibliography" at the end of the novel to reference more than one hundred scholarly sources as part of the painstaking historicization of this elusive "anti plague," intertextually positioning the narrative, like Jes Grew itself, between story and history, between fictional metaphor of African American folk culture and a seminar on Afrocentric hermeneutics. At one point during the novel's pedantic version of the "whoddunit" plot disclosure, a character interrupts (frames) his recitation on the an cient origins of Jes Grew with Moses and Osiris in Egypt with the declaration "You actually have been talking to a seminar" (138), and indeed the novel closes with its protagonist Hoodoo detective PaPa LaBas delivering a lecture at Harvard University on the Harlem Re naissance. We are audience to a seminar as we read Mumbo Jumbo. More importantly, though, we are also becoming a host for the antiplague with which Reed tantalizes us. The novel quite distinctly becomes a carrier of the information (virus) that destabilizes the linearity of Western Judeo-Christian epistemologies. If there is a lesson that we learn from the seminar interlarded in Mumbo Jumbo, beyond that of an alternative history, it is that there exists some essential thing commonly known as blackness func tioning as an indexicable, transhistorically unifying pattern of infor mation that randomly "downloads" into people during interfaces with certain cultural events, dance, jazz, and of course Reed's self-styled</page><page sequence="15">Chaney 275 necromancy. And although the program is compatible with different sorts of people, blacks are obviously more susceptible to the info virus than "Atonists," Reed's shibboleth for white hegemony. Thus blackness is not simply an effect of shared performative affectations, as Reed seems to indicate elsewhere, but it is also endogenous originating internally. As in Flight to Canada Hoodoo operates as a common language of the mysterious ethnicized code, the arcane pro gramming that blacks are naturally tapped into, which Raven, for example, accesses through the act of writing: "His writing was his HooDoo. Others had their way of HooDoo, but his was his writing. It fascinated him, it possessed him; his typewriter was his drum he danced to" (89). Reed posits a view of neural-linguistic deep struc tures that seem specifically geared toward processing racialized pro grams, and which may be racially specific. Like cyberpunk hackers, Reed's African Americans have a distinct "bioware" that is both more specialized to read Jes Grew's program and more prone to translate other cultural programming into the "Work" that configures Jes Grew. The "Work" or "Word" that Jes Grew seeks manifests in almost every aspect of black culture but resonates most intensely in black music. Though it is part of the fabric that interweaves his black char acters together, Reed's Work is not equivalent to Jes Grew in unify ing force; Papa LaBas's and Abdul Hamid's disagreement over how the Work is to be accomplished underlies a central rift within the black community over proper tactics toward achieving unity in black authenticity. In opposition to LaBas's insistence on cultivating Jes Grew and Herman's essentialist assessment of Jes Grew as "so deep in the race soul," Abdul defines the outbreak as mere social facilita tion and media fad, as "just a lot of people twisting they butts and getting happy" and pragmatically warns that black "people will have to shape up . . . Cut out this base dancing and carrying on, fulfilling base carnal appetites. We need factories, schools, guns" (34). Ironi cally, it is Abdul who finally translates the hieroglyphic text of Jes Grew; but finding that the text does not conform with his own vision of what blackness should stand for, he destroys it, thus defusing the outbreak in a final gesture of puritanical censorship, which he ex plains in a four-page handwritten note inserted in the text: "I have decided that black people could never have been involved in such a lewd, nasty, decadent thing as is depicted here. This material is ob viously a fabrication of the infernal fiend himself!! So, into the fire she goes!! It is our duty to smite the evil serpent of carnality" (202). Such a finale recasts the epidemic, altering its characterization hitherto as an inherently black cultural movement. After all, Hoodoo is a syncretic aesthetic inimical to univocalities, totalizations, and pure orthodoxies. Though it would appear to be an essentializing</page><page sequence="16">276 Ishmael Reed's Cybernetic Aesthetics agent pointing to the plenitude of a fully realized black interiority, Jes Grew is hereby linked to a non-exclusive raciality, rather signify ing a pantheistic humanizing force that threatens not just white or thodoxy but also Abdul's myopic vision of what black people should mean. It is he who essentializes an entity that resists categorization and racial affiliation despite its origins in Africa and seeming to de fine the deep structures of black culture so completely. So slippery is Reed's subtle waffling on this point, that his con tradictoriness infects his critics. R. M. V. Rao, for example, conveys Mumbo Jumbo's depiction of black history as paradoxically "a con tinuum, an all-pervading cultural consciousness, and not as a meta physical or transcendent phenomenon" (21). I do not wish to point out any confusion on Rao's part; on the contrary, Rao accurately lays out the tautological con-fusion of Reed's portrayal of Jes Grew as seemingly transcendent, perhaps even asymptotically approaching a transcendental phenomenon, but always stopping just short if only because of the indefatigable satire always unraveling the myth as soon as it unfolds. Perhaps this is why Henry Louis Gates, Jr. classi fies the novel as "both a definition of Afro-American culture and its deflation" (21). Reed may be exposing the mystical code that atavis tically inscribes the blueprints of essential black consciousness, but he does so while guffawing. And nowhere is his humor more piquant, or more detrimental to the integrity of the myth of black essential ism, than in the scenes involving the Talking Android. Mechanized Minstrelsy: The Talking Android and the Media Cyborg The second stage of the Wallflower Order's plan to retard the growth of Jes Grew is "to groom a Talking Android, who will work within the Negro, who seems to be [Jes Grew's] classical host; to drive it out, categorize it analyze it expel it slay it, blot Jes Grew" (17). The Talking Android is thus a counter installation electronically modeled after the organic incorporation of Jes Grew, who will ascend to a role of black dominance, a sort of puppet leader programmed to lead astray "the Negro" whose identity is coterminous with Jes Grew's mystical force. Also described as a "speaking skull" and "rapping antibiotic" (17), the Talking Android is initially meant to be played by the "New Negro," Woodrow Wilson Jefferson, an ambitious young man from rural Mississippi, who has internalized the racism of domi nant ideologies and memorized the works of Marx and Engels in order to ostensibly improve himself beyond the African-American masses whom he regards contemptuously as "lazy, shiftless, not ready" (30).</page><page sequence="17">Chaney 277 To be another's talking is slightly different here than in Flight to Canada, since the postslaves are not simply iterative but literate, not just transmitting a monologic discourse that for Reed, is a Hoodoo heresy, "to interpret the world using a single loa . . . like filling a milk bottle with the ocean" (24). As with Cato the Graffado, the learning of W. W. Jefferson operates in the service of white hegemony, since, as Abdul theorizes, the knowledge offered in schools is a de-ethnicized construction "stripped of its terms and private codes" (37). The im plication here is that white hegemony, which the Talking Android will foster, functions as a universalizing code, produced by a media ma chine disseminating ideology that is literally constructed out of the destruction of its co-opted other, in the same way that the secret societies ruling white society exist exclusively to combat Jes Grew. It comes as no surprise, then, that the Wallflower Order, with its secret plans and its pernicious technology, is described as the polar oppo site of what Jes Grew represents. Whereas Jes Grew is primitive, emotionally expressive, and fleshly, an obsessive artificiality pre dominates at the headquarters of the Wallflower Order where "Ev erything is polyurethane" and where even the body is subject to a disturbing plasticity: "Sometimes you play switch the brains and hide the heart f. . .]. Plastic will soon prevail over flesh and bones" (62). Like Jes Grew, the Talking Android is another entity in need of a human host, a body to carry a preordained text. Hinckle Von Vampton has the future of the Talking Android already planned out even be fore finding a body to play the role. As an art critic for the Benign Monster, a magazine marketed toward the black community, the Talk ing Android will gain cultural leadership solely to classify black cul tural productions as "derivative [. . . and] pandering to White read ers" (69) and eventually will tell Jes Grew that "it was promising, but flawed" (139). Reed clearly seems to be mocking early Jewish minstrels in Hubert "Safecracker" Gould, whose blackface antics allude to AI Jolson (born Jakie Rabinowitz) in Warner Brothers' first talkie The Jazz Singer (1927). As the Talking Android, Gould is transformed into the "domi nant figure in Negro letters" and reads his epic poem "Harlem Tom Toms" (157) in the vernacular for a captivated audience. During the reading, Papa LaBas and his entourage interrupt the New York func tion presided over by Von Vampton. At the wave of his hand, LaBas reveals the white skin beneath the blackface of the Talking Android, who is thereafter taken into custody by a team of Prince Hall Masons. While Reed's use of a science fictional robot may be ambigu ous, his attitude toward minstrelsy clearly falls on the "theft" side of the bivalent cultural work that Eric Lott ascribes to nineteenth-cen tury blackface, a practice hovering between cultural appropriation</page><page sequence="18">278 Ishmael Reed's Cybernetic Aesthetics (theft) and identification (love). In dramatizing the historically public minstrel as a secret agent of white supremacy Reed denies the pos sibility for positive affiliations in this parody of assimilationism as mechanized tokenism. Associating appropriations of blackness with technology, Reed's Talking Android offers an unusual test case of Harryette Mullen's media cyborg. Just as Robin's computer evolution reflects the way that technology itself was raced in the 1960s, the minstrel's designation as an "android" points to popular representa tions of robots and androids as cinematic villains. These maliciously programmed automata were often the mute tools of an alien or oth erwise mysterious enemy, as in the sci-fi films The Day The Earth Stood Still and Metropolis. Since, in many of these films androids do not speak, the addition of the modifier "Talking" not only makes Reed's particular invention that much more sinister, it also implies cognition and thus renders a sort of paradox: "Talking" implies agency; "An droid," thralldom. However, taken together, the speech of the talking android finally deciphers a kind of tape recorder, or two-way radio; combine with this the spectacle of the black face, and the result is television programming and cinema.. As with so many characters in Flight to Canada, the Talking Android stands in for another's speaking. His speech represents Von Vampton's on one level, the black community on another superficial level. In this configuration, Reed casts the "Talking" aspect of this mechanized minstrel as more diabolical than the "Android" compo nent. It is the expropriation of a speech connotative of authentic blackness more than any obvious mechanicity that makes the talk ing android-like. And because the vernacular has the potential to encode what was, and is, commonly considered to be authentic black expression, it also points to an essential, though mimickable, form of blackness. Mechanized minstrelsy thus becomes a metaphor for the covert passing of white supremacy in the guise of blackness, using technology as formats of domination and forums of control, whether it be television programming, print media, or art criticism. African-American relationships to a technology traditionally raced as a tool of white power follow the same politics of assimilationism and exclusion that surrounds minstrelsy. Reed's figuration of the minstrel cyborg in the Talking Android encodes several layers of ra cial mimicry, or mockery and instrumentalization. The deepest his torical substrate of blackface, according to Michael Rogin, entails an ironic exchange of mimes aping mimes as the typically Jewish, Irish, or Slavic minstrel copied the plantation slaves' "efforts to imitate white[s]" (33). But despite the confusion of who copied whom first, historical blackface attests to the accrual of the "surplus symbolic value of blacks [and] the power to make African Americans repre</page><page sequence="19">Chaney 279 sent something besides themselves" (14). Reed cyborgizes this sym bolic surplus value as it may have been manipulated by white power structures to stifle the burgeoning creativity of black writers during the Harlem Renaissance. In his fictional Talking Android, Reed impugns the media-gen erated cult of celebrity begun in the 1920s that draws attention to a single black artist, who by virtue of his or her singularity, gets "manu factured" as a token pawn of the white establishment. In a 1972 interview Reed explains this complex process of tokenism as cyborgization, as he recurs once again to a technological metaphor to describe the way the media transform even unwilling "token" black celebrities: "Leontyne Price is not a token Black. She is a great singer. But because of the kind of machine that has been responsible for creating leading members of our culture in politics and society, she's seen or viewed as a token Black" ("Interview: Ishmael Reed" 47). Agreeing that tokens are "like men, man-like but not really human" (Reed, "An Interview" 242), Reed again resorts to techno logical metaphors in a 1983 interview when locating New York City as the "scene where tokens are manufactured' (241; emphasis added). Beyond the possible resentment that such a view harbors, the Talking Android signals a doubly historicized crisis in black representationality in which the white minstrel, who constructs black ness as he copies its mode of copying, merges with the Harlem Re naissance "token," who also popularizes a form of supposedly au thenticated black speech, which is likewise nothing more than another kind of mask. All of these inessential attributes of blackness are then manufactured in a multiply dystopian figure combining the persis tent Romantic nightmare of autogenesis in Frankenstein and twenti eth-century "evil robot" films with a clever satire on Hollywood's first "talkie," (hence, Talking Android) The Jazz Singer, and its continuing tradition of reproducing black stereotypes in what Michael Rogin calls a figurative blackface. The Talking Android therefore prefigures a particular form of figurative blackface that Harryette Mullen defines as the media cy borg. Unlike the Talking Android, however, Mullen's media cyborg reflects the successful extrication of "the soul of black folks" trans planted onto white exteriorities through video and audio manipula tions: "the rhythmic expressions in traditions of dance, music, and orality in commodified forms of entertainment [. . .] draw upon the figure of the black as an icon of expressivity" (85). Moreover, there is an underlying contradiction in Reed's deployment of his Talking An droid, which seems to make an anti-essentializing argument about the hyperreal nature of blackness, even though the novel's closing seeks to historically ground black identity in an essential Africanicity.</page><page sequence="20">280 Ishmael Reed's Cybernetic Aesthetics As a copy of a copy, the Talking Android—like blackface in general and the media cyborg in particular—foregrounds the way blackness is transmitted and transformed by culture into a code that can then be mimicked or reproduced. Mumbo Jumbo points to the appropriability of blackness and registers a central anxiety regarding the decoupling of blackness from black bodies. Reed is able to throw this anxiety into sharper relief by employing metaphors of technol ogy. Reed's media cyborgization then is a return to an older, that is pre-Haraway, trope of the science fictional cyborg that operates, as noted by Csicsery-Ronay, according to modernist modes of essen tialism, evoking psychological panic by dramatizing the blurring of the body/mind split (395). So that in abandoning, quite temporarily and comically, notions of authentic black expression through the media cyborg of the Talking Android, Reed is heightening the panic associ ated with miscegenation and passing and thus, whether indirectly or not, sets in motion a narrative anxiety that seeks relief in the recom bination of media blackness with essentialized blackness. Neither Haraway Nor Mullen For many critics Reed typifies the postmodern writer because of his ambivalence toward linearity, his disruption of both narrative and historical chronology, and his cynical, often hilarious, toying with the artifice of race. But, as Michele Wallace suggests, placing Reed's work within a postmodern collective is only partially useful, because for black Americans, postmodernism is nothing new: "The past for Afro-American culture, particularly that oral 'tradition' (which includes jokes, stories, toasts, black music from spirituals to funk, and black English) pursued by the black masses has been precisely a postmodern one inevitably inscribing (and inscribed by) our absence from his tory, the dead-end meaninglessness of the signifiers, 'equality,' 'free dom,' and 'justice,' and our chronic invisibility to the drama of West ern civilization and European high culture" (78). At the same time, Mumbo Jumbo articulates an Afrocentric per spective. After exposing Gould as the Talking Android, Papa LaBas recites a history that discovers in Set's minstrel-like expropriation of a black Osiris's essence, the Ur-program, as it were, linking the deep structures of African Americans to Jes Grew and antediluvian Africa. From this perspective, Reed seems to epitomize an aesthetic that Wallace locates in contradistinction to postmodernism, a reactionary heterogeneous assemblage that she dubs "Black Modernisms," which are recognized by a "consistent pursuit of meaning, history, continu ity, and the power of subjectivity" (79). With Osiris as the autoch thonous progenitor of the now imitable "souls" of black folk, as well</page><page sequence="21">Chaney 281 as the essentialized original of the blackness that Jes Grew cyber netically attaches itself to, Reed reasserts a form of authenticity that echoes that which is most often posited by the Black Arts move ment: masculine, African, and pre-, if not overtly anti-European. In this case, Reed's use of the Talking Android would seem to be in agreement with Harryette Mullen's dystopian view of the media cy borg, as another reminder of the violent extractions of nativist subjectivities that collectively comprise the whole brutal history of colonialism and slavery. And yet, Reed's parodie style—LaBas's speech spoofs the detective or mystery novel's recap of the crime—may be read as a subtle way of undercutting this essentializing history. Thus Reed may be presenting in his fiction a way of celebrating a new cultural hybridity, in which there is no authentic blackness other than a performance of authentic blackness. The humor generated in the pathetic failure of the Talking Android may be chronologically spe cific, dependent upon references to AI Jolson, as if to imply that such overly obvious media cyborgization is now impossible, since what passes for or what essentially is blackness ultimately downloads it self into American culture at large. From this angle, Reed's Talking Android may be a deliberately flouted cyborg so as to serve as a foil to LaBas's more subtle approximation of a cyborg more compatible with Haraway's model. That LaBas can access both African spiritual technologies (loas, histories, texts) while also becoming a seminar— which is ultimately literalized in the novel's finale—"talking" to Harvard students finally nudges Reed's politics of cyborg representation closer to Haraway's camp. In LaBas we have the fictional cyborg equivalent of Reed's novel itself; both make fluid the traditional boundaries sepa rating the mechanical from the spiritual, the European from the Afri can, the fictional from the historical. In the end, Reed's fiction wavers between both the two forms of black aesthetics as defined by Wallace and the two kinds of cy borgs. For Reed, blackness is simultaneously a hardware-specific program, requiring genetic compatibility, as well as a universal pro gram that can be appropriable because it does not require instantiation in specific bodies, as evidenced in Jes Grew operating without its text or the nearly successful Talking Android, a white body not only disguised as black but engrafted with a black voice. If for no other reason, Mumbo Jumbo and Flight to Canada are integral texts to read in light of cybernetic theories precisely because they foreground so well the extent to which racial histories problematize the project of moving beyond the body, which theories of cyborg anthropology, cyberspace, and cybernetics in general seek to do. Approaching the problem of bodies, of having a body and possessing humanity, through a historical lens of slavery, which forced</page><page sequence="22">282 Ishmael Reed's Cybernetic Aesthetics Americans to legally define the limits of one's ability to own oneself and to own another, Reed seems to be questioning the extent to which African Americans can ever participate in fantasies of tran scending corporeality, or discorporation (leaving the body), or even cyborgization, merging the body with another's text, another's cog nition, as does Robin. So much of postmodern criticism is devoted to considering questions concerning decentered subjectivities and the liberal human subject in this hyperreal era of late capitalism without considering the possibility that Reed demonstrates in both of his novels—that for African Americans, so-called postmodern shifts in subjectivity herald nothing new. As argued by a host of critics, since African Americans have historically occupied a subjectivity that is not one, they thus remain persistently malleable, hybridizable, and cyborgizable. Seen in this way, one wonders if Reed utilizes cyborg thematics only to show how little change such radical new technolo gies offer for African Americans. Like the imagined Canada of Raven's poem, technoculture finally offers little that is different from the cul tural structures it seems to replace. Note 1.
