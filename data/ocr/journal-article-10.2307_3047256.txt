<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MOSAICS OF THE CAPPELLA PALATINA IN PALERMO AN ESSAY ON THE CHOICE AND ARRANGEMENT OF SUBJECTS ERNST KITZINGER DISCUSSION of the mosaics of Norman Sicily has long centered on the question of the re- spective shares of Byzantine and local masters in their actual execution. In these investi- gations, which have led different scholars to widely different results, insufficient attention has been paid to the problems posed by the general Byzantine affinities of these mosaics, which are, after all, undeniable. Is it not significant that an artistic form so peculiarly "Byzantine" should have been adopted by a Western dynasty which was in almost perpetual conflict with the Eastern Empire and which was, in fact, in its time one of Byzantium's most formidable rivals? Is it not also worth investigating how the Normans were able to use in their churches iconographic patterns which had been invented for Greek sanctuaries and were bound up with orthodox theology and liturgy through many intricate ties of symbolism? Transferred to an alien setting could these iconographic themes amount to more than purely superficial imitations? Or was there a purpose behind the adoption of this particular art by the Norman rulers and was it adapted intelligently to its surroundings? An inquiry into the choice and arrangement of subjects in the Cappella Palatina in Palermo- and, more particularly, in the sanctuary of the Chapel-throws considerable light on these questions. The mosaics in the eastern half of the Palermitan palace church constitute the earliest extant scheme of decoration undertaken by the Normans in Sicily. The arrangement follows in large part established rules of Byzantine church decoration. Yet it can be shown that the scheme is Byzantine in appearance only, and that it has been subtly and purposefully modified to serve as an expression of ideas which are outside the realm of Byzantine religious art and in a sense diametrically opposed to it.' I The Cappella Palatina was built by Roger II in the years following his assumption of the royal title in A.D. II3o. In A.D. I 40 the main parts of the structure must have been completed.2 For the famous mosaic decoration, which covers almost the whole of the interior, two dates are available. The first is King Roger's dedicatory inscription; in its decipherable parts it does not i. This article contains the substance of a paper on "The Mosaics of Norman Sicily and their Relation to Byzantium" read at a Dumbarton Oaks Symposium on "Byzantium and her Neighbors" on April 29, I949. Much of the material was gathered during a visit to Sicily in the summer of 1948. The visit was sponsored by the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection (Harvard University), and, according to pres- ent intentions, is to be followed with further work on the mosaics of Norman Sicily. I wish to take this opportunity to thank Professor A. M. Friend, Jr., the Director of Research at Dumbarton Oaks, who provided essential stimuli for this study, and the authorities in Palermo, particularly Professor Guiotto, the Soprintendente ai Monumenti, and Mons. Pottino, who facilitated my researches in the most courteous manner. Mv colleagues at Dumbarton Oaks helped me in various ways at various stages of the work; thanks are due particularly to Professor P. A. Underwood, who was good enough to read the article in manuscript and suggested many improvements. I also wish to express my gratitude to Dr. Otto Demus for letting me see the proofs of his forthcoming book on the mosaics of Norman Sicily. Our results are parallel to some extent; I have not, however, entered into a discussion of points of disagcreement. 2. The Chapel is first referred to in a document of A.D. IT 32 in which it is merely described as "founded" and in which it is granted parish rights (A. Garofalo, Tabularium Regiae ac Imperialis Capellae Collegiatae Divi Petri in Regio Panormitano Palatio, Palermo, 1835, p. 7). But in the great instrument of endowment dated A.D. 1I140 (ibid., p. I1) King Roger speaks of the building of the Chapel in the past tense.</page><page sequence="2">270 THE ART BULLETIN specifically mention the decoration, but since it is itself executed in mosaic and forms the lower frame of the decoration of the drum supporting the dome (cf. Fig. 5), work in this part of the Chapel must have been in progress in the year I143, which is the year recorded in the inscription.3 On the other hand, we learn from the chronicle of Romuald of Salerno that William I, Roger's son and successor, who ruled from I154 to 1166, decorated the church with mosaics.4 The two seemingly contradictory data have generally been reconciled by scholars through the assumption that William continued and completed the work initiated by Roger, but there is no unanimity as to the line of demarcation between the work of the father and that of the son." Naturally, there need not be an obvious break between the two phases, since artists who worked for Roger may have continued under William according to an established program. Indeed, so far as the pro- gram is concerned, it will be shown in a later section of this study that a master plan was evolved in all likelihood under Roger, a plan which provided at least for the bulk of the mosaics in the sanctuary. There is some indication that the mosaics in the nave may have been planned simul- taneously (see below, p. 282), even though the execution of the whole program may not have been completed in Roger's lifetime. From the architectural point of view the Chapel is a hybrid. It combines a Western basilican nave with a domed sanctuary which can be understood best as the nucleus of a Byzantine central- ized church modified to some extent in order to bring it into harmony with the nave.6 This is not merely a modern interpretation of the architecture. The designers of the mosaic program also looked upon the sanctuary as though it were a Greek naos and chose their subjects accordingly. It is this decoration in the sanctuary which offers the principal interest for the purposes of our discussion. But before we begin to examine it in detail a few words must be said about the mosaics in the nave, which consist mainly of a Biblical cycle beginning with the Creation and ending with the story of Jacob. Extensive illustration of the Old Testament is a feature of Early Christian and Western mediaeval but not of Byzantine church decoration.' Hence the boundary line between the "Byzantine" program of the sanctuary and the "Western" program of the nave would seem to be an obvious place where a break in the continuity of the work might be assumed. Indeed, many scholars have adopted this as the dividing line between the work of Roger II and that of William I.8 But the stylistic break at this point is by no means so clear as to be self-evident. In recent years other lines of demarcation between the two phases have been proposed." And granting even a break in execution at this point, it has already been indicated that sanctuary and nave mosaics may well have been planned simultaneously. 3. For this inscription see N. Buscemi, Notizie della Basilica di San Pietro detta la Cappella Regia, Palermo, 1840, p. 3' and pl. viii. It has suffered heavily from restoration, but the crucial words determining the decade and the ye4r within Roger's reign are in a relatively well preserved section in the western half of the band on the northern side. 4.

Grabar (Martyrium, Paris, 1946, I, p. 577 n. I) when he connects the architecture of the eastern half of the Cappella Palatina with the German "Doppelkapellen." The fact that there is underneath the sanctuary a lower story does not estab- lish a specific connection with the German examples, since, according to Prof. Grabar's own demonstration, a two-story arrangement is a typical feature of palace churches generally. An essential characteristic of the "Doppelkapelle" is the con- nection of lower and upper church by means of a central opening (0. Schiirer, "Romanische Doppelkapellen," Mar- burger Jahrbuch fiir Kunstcwissenschaft, v, 1929, pp. 99ff.). This feature is absent in the Cappella Palatina, where the lower story is more in the nature of a crypt and the upper church, which includes the nave, is completely self-contained. As will be pointed out later (p. 284), it is at least doubtful whether the throne at the western end of the nave belongs to the period of the original construction. 7.

If such a plan really did exist when the sanctuary mosaics were being executed a distinctly Western element was thereby injected also into this part of the decoration which in itself seems so Byzantine. The architecture with its strongly emphasized division between nave and sanctuary undoubtedly favored a two-part program but by no means demanded it. In the Christian East, after the earliest period, artists avoided Old Testament cycles even in decorating churches of longitudinal type."' Even in Early Christian and Western mediaeval basilicas, where large spaces were allotted to the Old Testament, it was by no means a rule that the Old and the New Testament should follow one another on the longitudinal axis of the church. In the schemes of Old St. Peter's and Old St. Paul's in Rome, which are thought to go back to the Early Christian period, Old and New Testament cycles confronted one another on the two walls of the nave." This scheme was repeated in later churches in the West.'" We do not know what subjects were depicted in the nave of Desiderius' church at Monte Cassino, which seems a likely source of inspira- tion for artists decorating a basilican nave in Norman Sicily, but we do know that there were both Old and New Testament scenes in the atrium." In Desiderius' church at Sant' Angelo in Formis the whole nave was given over to a christological cycle, while the Old Testament scenes found a place in the aisles. There is, however, a clear precedent in Early Christian art for an Old Testament cycle on both nave walls followed by a New Testament cycle in the area of the sanctuary, namely, the mosaic decoration of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. The specific characteristic of such an ar- rangement is that it expresses as a progression in space the time sequence of the two great phases in the history of salvation. It is this Early Christian scheme which was perpetuated or revived in the Cappella Palatina. Indeed, what we find here is perhaps more than a mere coordination of two phases. Certain devices seem to have been employed which would bring home to the beholder the fact that the Old Covenant had been defeated by the New and that the Era of Grace had triumphed over the Era of the Law.'4 Such ideas had no room in the Byzantine scheme of church decoration which was averse to all purely narrative or didactic elements. If in the Cappella Palatina these ideas were inherent in a master plan, as they may well have been, the mosaics in the sanctuary of the Sicilian church, however closely they may be modeled on Byzantine proto- types, lacked from the outset the timeless and static quality of the decoration of a Greek naos. They represent only one phase, albeit the principal one, in a two-phase narrative. A discussion of the sanctuary mosaics themselves will reveal further interesting deviations from the spirit of Byzantine church decoration. The very fact that it is so dependent on Greek models makes this part of the program the most suitable object of comparison. II The mosaics in the sanctuary may be divided conveniently into three groups: those of the dome and drum, those of the three apses, and, finally, those of the transept, that is to say, the central square and its two lateral wings. The dome (Fig. 20) is given over to the Pantokrator, a normal theme for the principal dome io. E.g. in Cappadocia. Ii. J. Garber, HWirkungen der friihchristlic/zen Gemnilde- zvklen der alten Peters- unI Pauls-Basiliken in Rom, Berlin and Vienna, g918, plans i-Iv. For the Early Christian origin of these decorations see ibtd., pp. 57ff. Cf. also the well-known letter of St. Nilus which seems to envisage a similar arrange- ment (J.-P. Migne, Patrologia Graeca, LXXIX, col. 577). 2z. Garber, op.cit., pp. z8ff. (Sta. Maria Antiqua, Fer- entillo). 13. Cf. Leo of Ostia's chronicle (Migne, Patrologia Latina, CLXXIII, col. 750). The tititli in Cod. Casin. z280 are thought to have belonged to these scenes (cf. H. Bloch, "Monte Cassino, Byzantium and the West in the Earlier Middle Ages," Dumbarton Oaks Papers, III, 1946, pp. 198f.). 14. See below p. 282.</page><page sequence="4">272 THE ART BULLETIN of a mid-Byzantine church. The bust of the All-Ruler is surrounded by four archangels in court costume and four "angels of the Lord." In the next zone-that of the drum-are four niches with full-length figures of prophets and forerunners (David, Solomon, Zacharias, and John the Baptist) bearing scrolls with prophetic texts. They are separated by seated figures of the evangelists in the four squinches. Eight additional prophets are depicted as half-length figures in the spandrels between niches and squinches (Fig. 5). In comparing this scheme with that of Byzantine Pantokrator domes it must be remembered that in Byzantine churches the transition from the dome to the square beneath is normally effected by means of pendentives rather than squinches, so that the four Evangelists, who commonly act as "corner supports" for the dome, find their places beneath the drum rather than in the drum itself. Allowing for this difference we may compare for instance the dome of St. Sophia in Kiev, dating from the eleventh century." Here, too, angels stand guard around the central bust, while the four Evangelists in the pendentives act as pillars supporting the celestial vision. In this case the figures in the intermediate zone are apostles, but there are also examples of Pantokrator domes with prophets, for instance at Daphni (eleventh century)'" and in St. Sophia in Novgorod (prob- ably early twelfth century)," to quote only works which certainly precede the Cappella Palatina in point of time. The Byzantine affinities of the dome decoration are obvious and easily documented. The icono- graphic program in the apses seems to be less dependent upon Byzantine conventions, but the situa- tion there is obscured by later changes-at least in the central apse-and by drastic restorations and additions in modern times. Indeed, the problems posed by these apses are so complex that they would require a separate study. Suffice it to say that most or all of the figures in the central apse (Fig. I)-and particularly the colossal figure of the Pantokrator (Fig. 23), which dominates the view and challenges, as it were, the supremacy of the Pantokrator in the summit of the dome- probably belong to a later phase than the bulk of the mosaics in the sanctuary;'8 that we do not know what figures were originally planned for, and perhaps actually depicted in the central apse;" and that the lateral apses (Fig. I), which in Byzantium would normally be given over to holy bishops and other representations connected with the liturgy, were here filled with two large busts of apostles (Figs. 14, I5)20 accompanied, apparently from the outset, by figures of saints whose relics were preserved in the apses.2 15.

Actu- ally, when the mosaics were uncovered in 1885 only fragments were found, but these were sufficient to ascertain the layout as a whole. For a detailed description of these fragments see D. Ainalov and E. K. Riedin, "The Cathedral of St. Sophia in Kiev" (in Russian), Zapiski of the Imperial Russian Archaeo- logical Society, N.S. IV, 1890, pp. 258ff. i6. E. Diez and O.

On the date, ibid., p. 31. 18. For the date of the Pantokrator bust see below p. 288. It seems to belong to the advanced twelfth century. The two archangels flanking the Hetoimasia in the vault preceding the apse are completely restored. Whether they originally be- longed to the same period as the Pantokrator I cannot say. Nor would I venture at this point an opinion on the date of the figures of St. Gregory and St. Sylvester placed beneath these angels. Buscemi (op.cit., Note, p. 35) suggests that they might be of the thirteenth century, but without adequate reproductions it is impossible either to confirm or deny this. Of the five figures in the lower zone of the apse the seated Virgin in the center is a modern work and takes the place of a window; it was exe- cuted by Santi Cardini, who was in charge of restorations from 178 to I825 (G. Riolo, Notizie dei restauratori delle pitture a mosaico della R. Cappella Palatina, Palermo, 1870, p. 3x). The saints flanking the Virgin are St. Peter, St. Mary Magda- len, St. John the Baptist, and St. James. According to Riolo (ibid., pp. 4off.) the first three of these were restored by Cardini, who, however, respected the heads at least partially. The figures, then, would be basically old, though hardly older than the Pantokrator bust above. This conclusion seems to me preferable to Buscemi's assumption (op.cit., Note, pp. 33f.) that the figures of St. Peter and St. Mary Magdalen were substituted for other saints in relatively modern times. For St. Peter, the titular saint of the church, see also footnote 20 below. The presence of St. John, but not that of St. Mary Magdalen and St. James, can be accounted for through the relics preserved in the main altar; cf. Buscemi, op.cit., Note, p. 26. I9. It will be shown in the next footnote that a case can be made for St. Peter having originally had a more conspicuous place in the main apse than he has now. To give a place of honor in the main apse to the titular saint would be a definitely Western idea. 20. In the southern apse is St. Paul (Fig. i5). The figure, though heavily restored, is basically authentic and, as will be seen later, belongs in all likelihood to the original program (see below p. 287). The corresponding bust of St. Andrew in the northern apse (Fig. 14) is much more radically restored</page><page sequence="5">MOSAICS OF THE CAPPELLA PALATINA 273 It may well be significant that in the apses, where Greek orthodox custom demands a particu- larly close connection between imagery and liturgy, the deviation from the Byzantine norm seems to be considerable, but in view of the uncertainty as to the subject matter originally placed in the main apse it would be hazardous to insist on this point, the more so as there is at least one group of figures in this area which does perhaps reflect Greek liturgical practice. The group referred to is on the wall above the northern apse and depicts the Virgin and Child with St. John the Baptist (Fig. 14). The image of the Virgin, as we shall see later, forms part of a larger scheme of mosaics which extends over the whole area of the transept and expresses a single unified idea." But this larger scheme did not necessitate the inclusion of St. John. His figure, smaller in scale than that of the Virgin and oddly squeezed into the leftmost part of the wall, in spite of the abundance of available space, seems all the more redundant as the Saint is represented already among the prophets and forerunners in the drum of the dome. Even the text on his scroll ("Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world," John i, 29) is the same in both cases. Possibly the figure of St. John above the northern apse should not be con- nected with the Virgin at all, but with the mosaics originally placed on the adjoining north wall of the north wing, which have disappeared completely and have been replaced by fanciful compo- sitions of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Fig. 6).23 On the other hand, there are good iconographic parallels which place the Baptist in association with the Virgin and Child, and good liturgical reasons for such an association. An eleventh century miniature in Ms 49 of the Pantokrator Monastery on Mt. Athos is particularly instructive because it shows a similar dis- crepancy of scale between the two figures.24 Liturgically the Virgin and Child and the Baptist are connected through the rite of the Proskomidi, the preparation of the eucharist in the Greek Church." In this rite the priest extracts from the eucharistic bread the central particle which bears (also by S. Cardini, according to G. Riolo, op.cit., pp. 4off.) but even in this case it is still possible to discover a mediaeval nucleus which is not unlike that of the figure of St. Andrew in the Martorana (Bottari, op.cit., Fig. 57)- I therefore am inclined to believe that the figure represented St. Andrew from the outset and was not put there in the seventeenth century to replace an original bust of St. Peter as Buscemi suggested (op.cit., p. 37; Note, pp. 34) 39). Buscemni reasoned that the original pendant to the bust of St. Paul could only have been St. Peter and that some special event must have caused the replacement of his figure by that of St. Andrew. This event, he assumed, was the disappearance of the Chapel of St. Andrew which we know was a dependency of the Cappella Palatina from the very beginning (see the document of 1132 quoted in footnote 2 above) and which he says was destroyed perhaps in the seventeenth century (p. 37). It was then that, according to Buscemi, St. Andrew was put in the northern apse while St. Peter wandered into the main apse. Buscemi's theory was taken over by numerous other writers, including Boglino (op.cit., p. 22), who, however, places the disappearance of the Chapel of St. Andrew in the first half of the sixteenth century. In reality neither the sixteenth nor the seventeenth century seems to be responsible for the figures of St. Andrew and St. Peter. Both appear to have a mediaeval nucleus and both were thoroughly restored in the late eighteenth century according to G. Riolo. It is in any case unlikely that St. Peter, the titular saint of the Cappella Palatina, should have been relegated to his present inconspicuous place in order to make room for St. Andrew. Instead I would suggest that St. Andrew, to whom the first dependency of the Palatine Chapel was dedicated, always occupied the northern apse and that St. Peter originally occu- pied a more prominent place in the main apse and was put into his present minor position in the advanced twelfth century in order to make room for the Pantokrator. 21. In the southern apse, beneath St. Paul, are St. Philip and St. Sebastian. In the northern apse, beneath St. Andrew, are St. Stephen and St. Barnabas. For the relics of these saints in the respective altars, see Buscemi, op.cit., Note, p. 26. Cf. also Grabar, Martyrium, I, pp. 56Iff., for relics in palace chapels. The central figures in both apses are modern work by Cardini and take the place of windows, as does the Virgin in the main apse (see above footnote 18). 22. See below, p. 285. 23. The fact that St. John now seems to point to the Virgin need not necessarily militate against such an assumption, since his gesture might be the result of a restoration. If the figure of St. John were to be connected with a scene originally placed on the northern wall-presumably a Passion scene, as we shall see later-his eccentric position would find a natural explana- tion: he was removed as far as possible from the Virgin so as to show that he belongs to a different context. He would be a commentator with a prophetic text and would be exactly com- parable to the figures of Isaiah and Joel in the opposite wing of the transept with prophecies likewise referring to scenes on adjoining walls (see below, footnote 32). It is interesting to note that the eighteenth century artist who designed the mosaic now on the adjoining right half of the northern wall definitely considered the figure of St. John as belonging to that wall, since he chose as his subject the "Lamb of God" (Fig. 6), of which the prophecy on the Saint's scroll speaks. 24. V. Lasareff, "Studies in the Iconography of the Virgin," ART BULLETIN, XX, 1938, p. 32, fig- 7. 0. Demus in his forth- coming book adduces this miniature as a parallel to the Cap- pella Palatina mosaic. Other pertinent examples are frescoes in S. Vito dei Normanni, where the Baptist is flanked by the Virgin and Child and by Pope Clement (A. Medea, Gli Affreschi delle cripte eremitiche pugliesi, Rome, 1939, p. ioi and fig. 47), and in the church of Nereditsa, where the Virgin and St. John form pendants in the two lateral apses (J. Ebersolt, "Fresques Byzantines de Ner6ditsi," Monuments Piot, XIII, 1906, pl. IV). Cf. also an ivory at Dumbarton Oaks (H. Peirce and R. Tyler, "Three Byzantine Works of Art," Dumbarton Oaks Papers, II, 1941, pp. i ff.) and an icon published by Xyngopoulos in Cahiers archkologiques, III, I948, pp. iI4ff. (see ibid., pp. I26f. and n. 6, for further parallels). 25. For this rite, cf. Xyngopoulos, op.cit., p. 125, and the literature quoted by him.</page><page sequence="6">274 THE ART BULLETIN the seal of Christ and which is called the Lamb ("Amnos"). Byzantine liturgists likened the po- sition of the "Amnos" in the center of the bread to the Divine Son in the womb of the Virgin Mary.26 The rite is accompanied by the words of the Baptist referring to the Lamb of God (John I, 29)," and takes place in the prothesis, the northern apse of the church. It can hardly be pure co- incidence when we find in the Cappella Palatina above the northern apse the Virgin and Child and St. John with his prophecy referring to the "Lamb." The group appears as a perfect illustration of the Proskomidi, more perfect than any extant example in a church of the Greek rite, though there are well-known instances in the East where either the Virgin or St. John occupy a prominent place in the prothesis.28 Thus the two figures may represent a piece of Greek apsidal decoration retained more or less mechanically in a church of the Latin rite. But since at present very little is known about the liturgical practices in Norman Sicily it would be unwise to rule out a priori the possibility that the two figures were intended to provide an appropriate and meaningful background for a cere- mony which may actually have taken place, at least on occasion, in the apse beneath.29 Whichever solution is the correct one we shall see later that the figure of the Virgin was in addition invested with another function of an entirely different order. The decoration in the main area beneath the dome in a Greek naos normally comprises two elements: a cycle of the life of Christ and a hierarchy of saints."0 We descend from the heavenly sphere of the All-Ruler to the earth, the scene of his incarnate life and the sphere of action of his saints and martyrs. It is precisely these two elements that also form the subject of the decoration in the main area of the sanctuary of the Cappella Palatina, an area which includes, in addition to the square beneath the dome, the two wings on either side. The hierarchy of saints is much abbreviated. Rows of martyrs are placed in medallions on the soffits of the arches supporting the dome (Figs. I-4), a position they often occupy also in Greek churches." Many of these martyrs are holy warriors. We are reminded of Hosios Lukas, where warrior saints are in sole and obviously symbolic possession of the arches on which the dome with its celestial inhabitants rests. In the Cappella Palatina, however, some of the most important warrior saints, including St. Demetrius, are not on the soffits, but on the outer, i.e. northern, face of the northern arch, out of sight of the beholder standing in the central area of the church. This curious disposition will be the subject of further comment later. The medallions on the inner faces of the northern and southern arches do not represent saints but Old Testament prophets (Figs. 3-5); they are a sequel to the series of prophets that starts in the dome, and this series comes to an end on the outer face of the southern arch, where there are five prophets corresponding to the group of warrior saints just mentioned.32 The hierarchy of saints continues with figures of 26. Cf. e.g. Theodore of Andida (Migne, PG, CXL, col. 429; also col. 425). 27. F. E. Brightman, Liturgies Eastern and Western, Ox- ford, 1896, p. 357, line 15. 28. Cf. e.g. the figure of St. John in the prothesis at Daphni and that of the Virgin and Child in the prothesis at Nereditsa. See also the parallels given by Ebersolt, op.cit., pp. 44f., and Xyngopoulos, op.cit., p. 124ff., both of whom interpret these figures in the light of the symbolism of the Proskomidi. 29. When G. Di Marzo says (Delle belle arti in Sicilia, I, Palermo, 1858, p. io8) that in Norman Sicily the lateral apses served "alle preparazioni," he probably has in mind primarily the offertory procession (cf. Buscemi, op.cit., Note, p. 25, with a quotation from a document from Cefalu, which indicates that this procession still took place in Sicily in the twelfth century; Buscemi interprets the passage as implying that the faithful deposited their offerings on the altar of the northern apse). Aside from this, however, it may be assumed that mass was celebrated occasionally in the Cappella Palatina according to the Greek rite. Since the Greek clergy still had the use of the Chapel on certain specified days of the year as late as A.D. 1274 (Garofalo, op.cit., p. 78), it is reasonable to suppose that in Norman times, when they were much more powerful, the Greeks, at the least, enjoyed an equal privilege. 30. Cf. the "classical" examples of the eleventh century in Greece: Hosios Lukas, Chios, and Daphni (Diez and Demus, op.cit.). The closest comparisons for the Cappella Palatina are provided by fresco decorations of Russian churches of the twelfth century, where saints and christological scenes are not confined to individual niches and panels, but cover the entire wall sur- faces in serried rows: e.g. Nereditsa (Ebersolt, op.cit., pp. 47ff., figs. 5, 6; V. K. Myasoyedov, Frescoes of Spas-Nereditsa [in Russian], Leningrad, i925, pl. 58) and the church of the Mirozh Monastery in Pskov (cf. the plates in A. I. Uspenskij, Notices on the History of Russian Art [in Russian], Moscow, 1910, pp. I39ff.). 31. For a list of these martyrs see Buscemi, op.cit., pp. 32, 37, 39. 32.

On the northern wall of the northern wing (Fig. 6) are five famous bishops of the Greek church (Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianz, John Chrysostom, and Nicholas of Myra) confronted on the southern wall of the southern wing by St. Dionysius and St. Martin (Fig. 5). Finally, on the western wall of the northern wing are three holy women (Fig. 16), and in the soffits of the arches leading from the transept wings into the aisles of the nave holy physicians (anargyroi). These two groups are a regular part of the hierarchy of saints in Greek churches and are commonly placed toward the west. The cycle of the life of Christ begins with the Annunciation on the eastern arch of the central square (Fig. I). It continues, on the same level, in the southern wing, where we find on the eastern wall the Nativity with the Adoration of the Magi and the Annunciation to the Shepherds (Fig. 15). The panel is "folded over" onto the southern wall, where the cycle continues with the Dream of Joseph and the Flight into Egypt (Fig. 7). This latter scene is again "folded over" and con- tinues on the western wall of the southern wing (Fig. 2). Thence we return to the central square where we find, still on the same level, the Presentation in the Temple. The main part of this scene occupies the western arch (Fig. 12), but Joseph and the Prophetess Anne are placed on ad- joining spaces of the southern and northern arch respectively (Figs. 3-5). The cycle now descends to a lower zone in the southern wing where we find the Baptism, the Transfiguration, and the Raising of Lazarus, and, in a third zone, the Entry into Jerusalem (Figs. 5, 8). There it apparently stops. The corresponding wall in the northern wing, which would seem to be a logical place for a continuation, is occupied in its lower half by the five figures of Greek bishops previously referred to. Above these is the arched opening of a balcony or loggia (Fig. 6). What wall space is left around this opening is covered by the eighteenth and nineteenth century mosaics already mentioned. These mosaics were executed after the wall in this area had been disturbed, first by the installation and afterwards the removal of a wooden box in which the Bourbon court sat during the service.34 The christological cycle does, however, continue above this area, for in the barrel vault of the northern wing we find the Ascension" and in the corresponding vault in the southern wing the Pentecost (Fig. 19). What is missing, then, is a sequence of Passion and post-Passion scenes be- tween the Entry into Jerusalem in the southern wing and the Ascension in the northern wing, but matching this gap there is a free wall space on the northern wall of the northern wing. We may assume with some confidence that this wall space originally accommodated the scenes which are needed to complete the illustration of the life of Christ. It is striking that with the exception of the Flight into Egypt (which, as we shall see, has a special raison d'etre in the Cappella Palatina) the ten extant scenes occur regularly in the so-called "cycle of the twelve feasts of the Lord," a cycle which, in spite of a good deal of variation in practice, constitutes a kind of standard minimum for the illustration of the life of Christ in later Byzantine art.36 The only two additional scenes which are absolutely essential to any "feast cycle" are the Crucifixion and the Anastasis (Descent into Hell)." Assuming that the arched opening in the upper part of the northern wall is an original feature of the architecture-and we shall have more to say about this later-there would still be room for these two pictures in the area now occupied by Samuel, Micha, and Joshua flanked by two full-length figures of Joel and Isaiah. The latter do not belong to the series of prophets that starts in the dome, but to adjoining christological scenes. Isaiah holds a prophecy (Is. viI, 14) referring to the Nativity on the eastern wall, Joel a text pertaining to the Pentecost scene in the vault above (see below, p. 278). For the saints on the northern side of the northern arch see below, pp. 284f. 33. In Greek churches holy bishops are usually placed in or near the apses. There are, however, instances where some of the most important bishops are placed in conspicuous positions in the naos (e.g. Hosios Lukas). 34. For this royal box see below, pp. 283f. 35. Erroneously referred to by earlier writers as the Assump- tion of the Virgin. The mosaic, which is badly restored, ap- parently has never been reproduced. 36. For the "feast cycle" cf. G. Millet, Recherches sur l'iconographie de l'Evangile, Paris, I916, pp. I5ff. A poem on the "feasts of the Lord" (ibid., p. 21) attributed to John Euchaites (eleventh century) or Theodore Prodromos (twelfth century) enumerates twelve events, including all those that are depicted in the Palatina, with the sole difference that the Cir- cumcision (rarely represented in Byzantine art) takes the place of the Flight into Egypt. For the limited validity of the term "feast cycle," cf. Grabar, Martyrium, II, p. 333. 37. Cf. the table Millet, op.cit., p. 23.</page><page sequence="10">276 THE ART BULLETIN mosaics of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries." If this reconstruction is correct the sanctuary of the Cappella Palatina originally contained what amounts to a standard version of the Byzantine iconography of the life of Christ. III As the description has shown, the themes depicted in the eastern part of the Chapel-with the possible exception of those in the apses-are those normally found in domed, centralized churches in the Greek and Slavonic world in the same period. But the description has also brought out certain peculiarities in the arrangement of these themes. The chief anomaly is the asymmetric distribution of the mosaics in the two wings of the transept. Not only is there a lack of balance between the fig- ures on the outer faces of the northern and southern arches, but the whole New Testament cycle seems to be weighted to one side. Allowing even for two additional scenes in the northern wing the southern wing still has a larger share of subjects from the life of Christ. In the northern wing there are no scenes, but only figures of saints, in positions corresponding to the Nativity, the Entry into Jerusalem, and that part of the Flight into Egypt which is on the western wall."9 When we consider that there was not so very much space for representations from the life of Christ in the first place and that more events could easily have been included, particularly in the Passion and post-Passion sequence, without unduly expanding the "narrative" element, it is certainly striking that the space in the northern wing was not utilized fully for the christological scenes. The asym- metry of the decoration in the two wings is anything but normal, and, as we shall see later, highly purposeful. Let us now examine more closely the christological cycle. Evidently some scenes have received greater emphasis than others. The Annunciation and the Presentation in the Temple have been placed in very honored positions immediately beneath the dome. It seems that in order to be able to place the Presentation in the Temple in the central square the artist has spun out the preceding scene, the Flight into Egypt, in extraordinary fashion.40 He has included not only a personification of "Egypt" reverently receiving the Christ Child, he has developed the city gate, in front of which the reception takes place, into an elaborate piece of architecture followed in turn by a large palm tree. Thus he has contrived to place considerable emphasis also on this scene which fills not only almost the entire width of the southern wall of the southern wing but the adjoining western wall as well (Figs. 2, 5, 7). Indeed, together with the Dream of Joseph, which belongs to it, the Flight covers as much wall space as the three scenes of the next lower zone combined, a fact which is all the more remarkable since it is the only one among the extant christological subjects in the Chapel that we have noted as an unnecessary representation in a "feast cycle." The Entry 38. It is quite possible that this hypothetical reconstruction of the missing part of the cycle can be tested by means of a thorough scrutiny of the wall area in question. The eighteenth century landscape with the "Agnus Dei" to the right of the arched opening (Fig. 6) is not altogether homogeneous and traces of the earlier work which it was meant to replace may still be extant in this area (cf. the photograph Anderson no. 29937). It would be highly desirable to carry out this investi- gation. 39. It is not quite certain that the five Greek bishops on the northern wall are an original part of the decoration (see below, footnote 91). But they can hardly have been put there -after what would be in any case only a short time interval-- to replace any christological scenes. 40. For the sequence-Nativity, Adoration of Magi, Flight into Egypt, Presentation in the Temple-which we find also in Monreale, cf. several of the Cappadocian cycles: e.g. Qeledjar (G. de Jerphanion, Les Eglises rupestres de Cappadoce, I, i, Paris, 1925, p. 205) ; Toqale, New Church (ibid., I, 2, 1932, pp. 3Iof.); Sts. Apostles (ibid., II, 1, I936, pp. 67f.). Since the story of the Magi and that of the Massacre of the Innocents are interrelated it is almost inevitable that in cases where the Adoration of the Magi is combined with the Nativity (as in the Palatina) the Presentation in the Temple, though depict- ing an event which took place only forty days after Christ's birth, should be placed after the Flight (or any other event connected with the Massacre). The difficulty can be avoided by taking the Presentation out of the cycle altogether, as is the case in the Old Church at Toqale (Jerphanion, ibid., i, I, pp. 269, 286). In the Cappella Palatina the Presentation clearly follows after the Flight into Egypt, though at the same time it is somewhat isolated from the sequence (cf. also below, p. 282). For the problems involved in the arrangement of these Childhood scenes, cf. G. de Jerphanion, La Voix des monu- ments, N.S., Rome and Paris, 1938, pp. 2z8ff.; A. De Capitani d'Arzago, in: G. P. Bognetti, etc., Santa Maria di Castelseprio, Milan, 1948, p. 594.</page><page sequence="11">MOSAICS OF THE CAPPELLA PALATINA 277 into Jerusalem also has been given a conspicuous and relatively large space, in fact one of the most favored places in the whole church. Finally, there are two scenes which have been allotted an entire vault each, the Ascension and the Pentecost. Byzantine convention accounts for the placing of at least three of these scenes, the Annunciation, the Ascension, and the Pentecost. The first two need not detain us for more than a moment. The Annunciation was frequently placed on the eastern arch, for this arch, beyond which only the priest can pass, was interpreted symbolically as Ezekiel's eastern gate, through which no man shall enter because the Lord has entered in by it (Ez. XLIV, I-2); that is to say, it was a symbol of the Miraculous Conception which the Annunciation represents.4 The Ascension is one of the standard themes for domes and vaults.42 The composition of the scene in the Cappella Palatina agrees completely, for instance, with that of the dome of St. Sophia in Salonika," except that, owing to the restricted space, the full-length figure of Christ has been replaced by a bust. Evidently the artist treated the barrel vault as though it were an elongated dome. This could be said also of the Pentecost opposite (Fig. 19). But here the deviations from the Byzantine norm, as exempli- fied for instance by the presbytery dome of Hosios Lukas," are more considerable and require a somewhat more detailed discussion. The artist has made effective use of architectural conditions by placing in the two lunettes at either end of the barrel vault (Figs. I, 2), on the one hand, two Jews," to represent the nations who are to be converted by the apostles, and, on the other, a bust of Christ with an open book inscribed with the words of John viii, i2: "I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life" (Fig. 21). The unbelievers are made to look, as it were, straight into the "light." The symbolism of the light which is to illuminate mankind plays a conspicuous role in both Eastern and Western liturgical and homiletic texts per- taining to Pentecost.46 We also know that the conversion of the Jews was a particular concern of Roger II toward the end of his reign,"' the precise period, as we shall see, during which these mosaics appear to have been made.48 It was an ingenious idea to single out among the Races and Tongues frequently represented in Pentecost scenes the Jews and to confront them with the figure of Christ. But this latter feature also betrays the fact that we are here remote from the sphere of orthodox theology. It probably would be difficult to find anywhere in Byzantine art a representation of Pentecost in which the Deity is depicted in anthropomorphic shape. The presence of this figure might easily suggest to a beholder that the Son could be a source of the Holy Spirit and this thought was, of course, anathema to the Greek Church, which had parted company with 41. Ainalov and Riedin, op.cit. (see footnote 15), pp. 286f., i propos the Annunciation on the eastern arch of St. Sophia in Kiev. The same arrangement occurs in other churches in Russia: Kiev, St. Cyril (A. V. Prachov, "Monuments of Byzantino- Russian Art in Kiev" [in Russian], Drevnosti. Trudy of the Imperial Archaeological Society in Moscow, xI, 3, 1887, P. I7)i Pskov, Mirozh Monastery (J. A.

An interesting case in the West is the cycle of Ezekiel scenes on the vault of the lower church at Schwarzrheindorf. The vision of the Lord's Entry through the Eastern Gate is placed toward the east at the entrance to the chancel a fragment of an inscription on the arch underneath mentions the Virgin Mary (P. Clemen, Die Romanische Monu- mentalmalerei in den R/heinlanden, Diisseldorf, 1916, pp. 293f. and pl. xIx). 42. O. Demus, Byzantine Mosaic Decoration, London, I947, pp. 17ff. 43. Ch. Diehl, M.

The two figures, barely visible on Fig. i9, were identi- fied correctly as Jews by G.

In the West Christ occurs in Pentecost scenes quite frequently.4" The figure of Christ was, however, perhaps not solely intended as a pendant to the Jews in the western lunette. It occupies the center between two rows of apostles, who, unlike the apostles in Byzantine Pentecost domes, are placed on continuous rather than individual seats. The resulting composition is curiously reminiscent of the main group of figures in scenes of the Last Judgment.so The presence of the four archangels in the summit of the vault perhaps also suggests an eschato- logical context rather than Pentecost. It is indeed possible that the mosaic, though clearly repre- senting the Descent of the Holy Ghost, was also meant to imply the Second Coming at the end of time. Beneath the vault, among the prophets on the outer face of the arch separating the southern wing from the central square, there is a figure of the Prophet Joel, who plays the role of commentator to the Pentecost scene." He holds up, toward the scene in the vault, a scroll inscribed with the prophecy in which he foretold the descent of the Spirit. But the words are not those of the prophet himself as recorded in Chapter II, verse 28 of the Book of Joel ("And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit"). Instead the mosaicist has put on the scroll the words of Joel as quoted by St. Peter in Acts ii, i7, a quotation which includes the sig- nificant change: "And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my spirit." The fact that the version from Acts was chosen rather than that from the Book of Joel itself may well mean that the artist was aware of and wished to underline certain eschatological overtones of the scene. This eschatological meaning was clearly intended by the writer of Acts himself52 and was elaborated in patristic and mediaeval literature. Various more or less far-fetched reasons were given why Pentecost is a forerunner, a "figure" of the Last Things." These ideas were known in Sicily in the twelfth century."5 Within the realm of iconography there are other instances, aside from the mosaic in the Palatina, where the Pentecost scene may have been intended to embrace the events at the end of time as well." 49. Cf. e.g. the Sacramentary of Drogo, initial for collect of Whitsunday (L. Weber, Einbanddecken, Elfenbeintafeln, Min- iaturen, Schriftproben aus Metzer liturgischen Handschriften, I, Metz and Frankfurt a.M., 1913, pl. 17,2) ; Lectionary from St. Trond, Belgium (E. G.

Fabre, "L'Iconographie de la Pente- c6te," Gazette des Beaux-Arts, LXV, 1923, 2, p. 37). The scene in the Cluny Lectionary (Paris, Bibl. Nat., lat. 2246, fol. 79v) does not illustrate the Pentecost proper (Fabre, op.cit., pp. 36ff.). But we may add a South Italian example, a relief on the Farfa ivory box: H. Bloch, op.cit. (above, footnote 13), fig. 252. 50. Cf. particularly the twelfth century fresco of the Last Judgment in the Demetrius Church in Vladimir, where the two rows of apostles are placed on either side of a barrel vault, as they are in the Cappella Palatina. The figure of Christ, now destroyed, must have been in the lunette between them (I. Grabar, Die Freskomalerei der Dimitrijkirche in Vladimir, Berlin, n.d., pls. II, iii and pp. 4xff.). The placing of the apostles on continuous seats, without a figure of Christ in the center, would not alone be sufficient to establish, even tenta- tively, a relationship between our mosaic and scenes of the Last Judgment. 51. For this figure see above, footnote 32. The fact that the figure belongs to the Pentecost scene is made abundantly clear by the verses which are placed on the band at the base of the vault: Fit sonus e coelis et iuxta scripta Johelis Imbuit affatus sancti vehementia flatus Pectora mundorum succendens discipulorum Ut vite verbum per eos terat omne superbum 52. Cf. K. Lake, in: F. J. Foakes Jackson and K. Lake, The Beginnings of Christianity, pt. i, The Acts of the Apostles, v, London, 1933, p. 1xx3 53. The argument may be found in both Eastern and Western writings. It is bound up with the symbolism of the number 50o (=7 X 7+ ). The Jewish jubilee year, the Lord's rest on the seventh day of Creation, and the idea that the world will come to an end with the completion of the seventh age all combine to make of Pentecost a figura futurae resurrectionis (Isidorus, De eccles. oficiis, I, 34; Migne, PL, LXXXIII, cols. 768f.) and a "typos of the Day of Remission, the Day Without Evening" (Leo the Wise, Oratio xII; Migne, PG, cvii, cols. i24f.). 54.

There are, of course, numerous instances in which the Pentecost forms the concluding scene in a christological cycle. No secondary meaning need be intended in every such case. But it is perhaps significant that in certain programs which in- clude, in addition to a christological cycle, the scene of the Last Judgment the Pentecost is omitted. The omission is par- ticularly striking in the fresco decoration at Sant' Angelo in Formis, where the christological cycle is otherwise very rich and detailed; it concludes with the Ascension at the eastern end of the northern wall and is followed by the Last Judgment on the western wall (G. de Jerphanion, La Voix des monu- ments, Paris, 1930, pp. 265, 28o). The equally rich cycle at Nereditsa probably provides a parallel case. In this decoration, which also includes a Last Judgment on the western wall, the</page><page sequence="13">MOSAICS OF THE CAPPELLA PALATINA 279 If this interpretation of our mosaic is correct, the position of the Christ bust is doubly meaningful. For we may then assume that it is meant to be related not only to the figures of the Jews opposite but also to the scene of the Nativity immediately below. It would be an image of the Christ of the Second Coming, towering magnificently over the humble scene of his First Epiphany. The bust would be, so to speak, a hinge marking the place where the sequence of scenes, having circled the entire sanctuary, returns to its starting point. It would be a link tying together the beginning and the ultimate climax of the Christ story in a dramatic contrast. IV We have been able to account through Byzantine conventions for three of the scenes prominently placed in the sanctuary of the Palatine Chapel. We still have to explain the emphasis placed on the Flight into Egypt, the Presentation in the Temple, and the Entry into Jerusalem. These are the three events in the life of Christ which in Early Christian iconography were conceived of in terms of the triumphal progress and solemn reception of a ruler, or, to use classical expressions, as the king's profectio, adventus, and occursus. The subject has been discussed fully and brilliantly in recent years."5 In our present context the briefest summary must suffice. Invested with a mes- sianic meaning ever since Hellenistic times the adventus ceremonial assumed considerable im- portance as a part of the Roman emperor cult. The emperor's arrival in a particular city or country was likened to, or symbolically interpreted as, the epiphany of the world savior. The scene is reflected in Roman imperial iconography," where we may distinguish between a more "realistic" type of adventus scene, showing the emperor followed by his retinue and a crowd welcoming him life of Christ apparently comes to an end with the Ascension in the central dome; we cannot be quite sure, however, that the Pentecost was not represented among the frescoes now lost (for references see above, footnotes 24, 30). Among several other early Russian church decorations which include the Last Judgment, there is none which has the Pentecost scene as well. But since most of these decorations are very imperfectly pre- served no conclusions should be based on this fact. On the other hand, the case of the mid-twelfth century decoration in the church of the Mirozh Monastery in Pskov may be signifi- cant. Here the place over the main entrance-so often given over to the Last Judgment in Russian churches of this period-- is occupied by the Pentecost scene (I. Tolstoi and N. Kondakov, Russian Antiquities in Monuments of Art [in Russian], vI, St. Petersburg, 1899, p. 184 and fig. 227). The Last Judg- ment was apparently omitted. Tolstoi and Kondakov, op.cit., p. 179, mention a "Last Judgment on the western wall," but this is probably a mistake; the scene is referred to neither in N. V. Pokrovskij's detailed description of the Pskov frescoes in his Notices of Monuments of Christian Art and Iconography (in Russian), St. Petersburg, 1910, pp. 253ff., nor in I. Grabar's list of early representations of the Last Judgment in Russian churches, op.cit., p. 32. It does seem, then, that Pentecost and Last Judgment were sometimes considered as interchangeable subjects, as indeed they might be, in the light of the texts quoted in the preceding footnotes. Certain twelfth century representations in the West seem to combine features of the Pentecost scene with eschatological elements (cf. H. Focillon's comments on the northern apse at St. Gilles at Montoire in Peintures romanes des eglises de France, Paris, 1938, pp. 40f., and A. Katzenellenbogen's interpretation of the tympanum at Vezelay as a "telescoped" representation of var- ious phases of the mission of the apostles, including the Descent of the Holy Spirit and the Judgment of Mankind: ART BULLE- TIN, XXVI, 1944, pp. 14xff.). These observations naturally bring up the problem of the late twelfth century mosaic on the triumphal arch of the Abbey Church of Grottaferrata, a work commonly ascribed to Sicilian artists. The mosaic (J. Wilpert, Die r'6mischen Mosaiken und Malereien der kirchlichen Bauten 'vom 4. bis zum z3. Jahrhundert, Freiburg, 1916, IV, pl. 300) clearly depicts the Descent of the Holy Spirit. But in the center, between the two groups of six apostles, is a medallion with the apocalyptic lamb. The empty throne, which is to be seen above the lamb, was put there in modern times and we do not know what was in its place originally (on this question cf. A. Baum- stark, "Il Mosaico degli apostoli nella Chiesa Abbaziale di Grottaferrata," Oriens Christianus, IV, i904, pp. 132ff. and Wilpert, op.cit., II, pp. 9i5f.). In any case the eschatological meaning of the scene was clearly brought out in the verses which once accompanied the mosaic: Caetus apostolicus residens cum iudice (Christo) Praemia iudicio meritis decernit in isto. Admittedly we cannot be sure that this inscription is as old as the mosaic itself. But Baumstark was obviously wrong when he said (p. 132) that the inscription cannot have been original because it is in Latin, whereas the name inscriptions of the apostles are in Greek. This is a common phenomenon in twelfth century mosaics and the Cappella Palatina provides numerous examples (cf. e.g. footnote 51 above). Wilpert ac- cepts the inscription as original and says the mosaic expresses "the idea of the Last Judgment by means of a representation which possesses all the characteristics of a Pentecost picture" (ibid., p. 915). Wilpert, however, appears to have been un- aware of the literary and iconographic parallels which make his interpretation plausible, and he erred in considering the mosaic as being of the same date as the Ducento fresco of the Trinity on the wall above. 56.

In Christian art there is one scene which more than any other underwent the influence of the ad- ventus iconography, namely, Christ's Entry into Jerusalem. The Palm Sunday scene was the arrival in his capital city of the Messianic King of Israel. Within the christological cycle it is the royal event par excellence, and it is only natural that artists should have visualized it as an adventus. Most of the iconographic features in the representations of the Entry were borrowed from the "realistic" type of adventus scene, though allegorical elements were sometimes added."s The iconography of the scene underwent little change throughout the Middle Ages and the rendering, for instance, in the Cappella Palatina is essentially still the same as on Early Christian sarcophagi (Fig. 18)." The connection of the Flight into Egypt with the ruler's adventus is less obvious but also per- fectly logical in the light of the apocryphal accounts which describe the event as a triumphal progress of the Lord through heathen lands. The connection is expressed unambiguously in an Early Christian enkolpion which shows a personification of Egypt (the Natio) receiving the Holy Family and Joseph acting as a cursor."? In this case it is the allegorical rather than the realistic type of imperial adventus which has influenced the artist, and this influence was perpetuated by icono- graphic tradition, particularly in Byzantium. One or another of the features of the pagan adventus allegories occurs frequently in later representations of the Flight. But few if any representations of the scene combine as many elements of the adventus as the mosaic in the Cappella Palatina (Figs. 7-I1). It shows the Natio greeting the ruler at the city gate,"6 the winged cursor-now an angel -leading the procession,62 the Lord in a heroic pose of greeting or blessing,83 and the pedisequus, who has inherited the role of the Roman standard bearer,64 though his load now consists of a simple bundle containing the Holy Family's worldly possessions. The Presentation in the Temple is the Lord's solemn reception by the aged Simeon. From an artistic point of view the scene was less well suited than the other two for an interpretation as an imperial adventus. But the influence of imperial iconography is evident nevertheless in the very first of all known renderings of the scene, a mosaic on the triumphal arch of Santa Maria Maggiore.65 The name, Hypapante, by which the event is designated in Byzantine literature, liturgy and art is itself "a technical term for the constitutional welcome of royalty."66 It can hardly be pure coincidence that three scenes in which Christ figures specifically in the role of a triumphant ruler have received special emphasis in the cycle of the Palatina. The suspicion arises that this special emphasis may have something to do with the role of the Chapel as a palace church. In order to gain certainty in this respect it is not enough, however, to have shown that the scenes were originally conceived as, and to some extent modeled after, royal advents. We must be sure that they still carried these regal connotations in Sicily in the twelfth century. This proof is readily forthcoming in the case of the Entry into Jerusalem. The Palm Sunday scene certainly never lost its regal associations throughout the Middle Ages. Originally modeled after the reception of Hellenistic kings and Roman emperors, it in turn became the inspiration, the ever-present archetype, of all ceremonial receptions of mediaeval rulers.

The whole passage is a com- parison between the triumphs of the king and the triumphs of Christ. The preacher describes in glowing terms King Roger's God-given victories (vtKa. ... KaL . . rpTTrata) and then applies identical words to Christ's Entry into Jerusalem, an entry which, unlike his previous arrivals in the city, was surrounded by pomp and glory. "For the divinely ordained plan was nearing its end, the Passion was approaching . . . and in addition to his other miracles Christ had proved himself victor over Death by snatching Lazarus from him. So he enters the city like a king with tro- phies and victories and with his guards (... o.0 ao-LXE)O LXETra rprTraLa Ka, VKa 8opv4 opoVLJEvog)." Another homily by the same author contains a brief account of the Flight into Egypt in which that event is described as a triumphal progress: "Christ ... goes to Egypt shaking and confounding the idols in that country; then ... called by his Father, he returns as a victor (vrtKldo'pog) already four years old according to the flesh.""6 Two of the scenes, then, were certainly thought of as triumphal processions in twelfth century Sicily. The case of the Hypapante is more complex. Among the extant homilies of Philagathos none is dedicated to this event. So this source cannot help us to elucidate any special significance it may have.70 The simplest and most obvious explanation of its prominent position on the western arch is that the artist selected it as a suitable pendant to the Annunciation on the eastern arch. But although there are other instances where the Presentation scene is accommodated on two sides of an arch" the scene is not really very well suited for this position, especially when the artist is unwilling to omit the temple scenery and is forced by the shape of the arch to show the architecture with its lower half cut off (Fig. 12). On the other hand, the arrangement of Annunciation and Presentation in the Temple as pendants is frequent enough to be considered a convention.72 Hence among the scenes represented in the Palatina cycle the Hypapante was perhaps a natural choice for the western 67. Cf. the rich material gathered by Kantorowicz, op.cit., pp. 2o8ff., and the same author's Laudes Regiae, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1946, pp. 7iff. 68. Migne, PG, cxxxII, cols. 54Iff. For the identity of the author, cf. A. Ehrhard, Oberlieferung und Bestand der hagiographischen und homiletischen Literatur der griechischen Kirche, pt. i, III, fasc. 5, Leipzig, 1943, pp. 631ff. On the basis of an exhaustive analysis of the manuscript tradition Ehrhard comes to the conclusion that the homilies later ascribed to a "Theophanes Kerameus, Archbishop of Taor- mina" were the work of a preaching monk by the name of Philagathos, "who normally officiated in the cathedral of Rossano but made his appearance also in Sicily under the rule, and perhaps at the bidding of King Roger II and his suc- cessors" (ibid., p. 679). The Madrid Ms gr. 16 contains a variant of the Palm Sunday homily with an invitation to pray for King William (ibid., pp. 664, 672f.). 69. Migne, PG, cxxxii, col. 925. 70. In Madrid Ms gr. 16, which contains a number of un- published homilies by Philagathos, there is one on the Hypa- pante, which, however, according to Ehrhard (op.cit., p. 660), is simply an extract from the Gospel commentary of Theophy- lactus of Bulgaria. This commentary (Migne, PG, cxxiii, cols. 725ff.) makes no particular point of the triumphal character of the event. But although Theophylactus seems to have been one of Philagathos' principal sources (Ehrhard, op.cit., p. 665 n. i) his text does not necessarily represent everything that Philagathos had to say on the subject. In particular, the homily in the Madrid Ms lacks a prooemium. 71. Kiev, St. Cyril; Milesevo. See next footnote. 72. The case of the Martorana, where the two scenes are in positions corresponding exactly to those they occupy in the Palatina, hardly counts since the greater part of the decoration of the Martorana is in all likelihood simply an abbreviated ex- tract from the program of the Palatina (see below, footnote 10o7). Another exact parallel is provided by the thirteenth century fresco decoration of the church of Milesevo in Serbia, where Annunciation and Presentation in the Temple confront each other on the piers of the eastern and western arches of the central square (cf. nos. 7/107 and 29/95 on the diagrams in N. L. Okunev, "Milesevo," Byzantino-Slavica, VII, 1937-38, pp. 80, 81; also ibid., pl. xxv,i). Since this decoration shows Italian influence (Okunev, op.cit., pp. ioif.) it might con- ceivably owe something to our Sicilian examples. But Annunci- ation and Presentation in the Temple had already been treated as pendants on the triumphal arch of Sta. Maria Maggiore, and, later on, at Qeledjar (Jerphanion, Les Eglises rupestres, I, i, pp. 202, 205, 216 and pl. 45,2). Perhaps the most perti- nent example is the twelfth century fresco decoration in the church of the monastery of St. Cyril in Kiev. In this instance, which is certainly not under Italian influence, Annunciation and Hypapante are placed one beneath the other on the lateral piers of the triumphal arch. Cf. the description by Prachov, op.cit. (above, footnote 41), p. I7, and the illustration of one half of the Hypapante in I.

But although this may be one, or even the principal, reason why the Hypapante was put in this particular place there were probably other considerations as well. When we turn to the mosaics at Monreale, executed little more than a gen- eration after those of the sanctuary of the Palatine Chapel, we find that the Presentation in the Temple is placed again on the western arch of the sanctuary square. Since this cycle contains a far richer series of scenes than that of the Palatina and since the architectural setting is by no means identical, a special effort must have been made to secure this position for the Hypapante. Yet the scene is not in this case a pendant to the Annunciation.7" Instead there is on the same arch a comple- mentary panel showing Christ among the Doctors (Fig. I3). There are other cycles in which this scene follows after the Presentation in the Temple."' But in Monreale there may well be a special intention in placing the Presentation in the Temple and Christ among the Doctors side by side on the western arch. The two scenes have this in common that they both depict Christ's triumph over representatives of the Old Law. The western arch is the divide between the sanctuary and the nave, i.e., between areas whose decorations are dedicated to the New and the Old Covenant respec- tively. Thus the scene, supplemented by another with similar content, provides a link with the subject matter of the nave mosaics. The arrangement serves, as it were, to put the world of the Old Testament into proper perspective. Indeed, when we look west from the sanctuary we see the events of the Old Testament framed by an arch on which representatives of the Old Law are de- picted in the act of submitting to Jesus Christ. Returning now to the Cappella Palatina, we may suggest that here, too, the Hypapante had been designed as a link with the nave decoration. At least this may have been an additional reason why the scene was put on the western arch. This incidentally would be an indication that the Old Testament cycle in the nave must have been planned when the mosaics in the sanctuary were made."' The relation of the Hypapante to the Old Testament cycle in the nave brings out the triumphal character of the scene. In Monreale this triumphal character is underlined further through the presence of a commentator in the person of the Prophet Malachi, who stands in the spandrel im- mediately beneath the Hypapante (cf. Fig. 13) and holds up a scroll with the first words of his prophecy: "ECCE EGO MITTAM ANGEluM MEVm ET PREparabit viam ante faciem meam.""77 In the Roman missal the reading of this prophecy is prescribed for the feast of the Presentation in the Temple, a fact which presumably accounts for its presence in this particular place."7 But the text 73. See above, footnote 40. 74. In Monreale there are two Annunciation scenes. One is ceremonial and symbolical and is placed in the obligatory position on the arch preceding the apse, which, however, is not the arch corresponding to that with the Hypapante. The two arches are separated by the eastern arch of the central square, which bears figures of military saints. The other An- nunciation scene is purely narrative; it forms part of a sequence of four scenes on the southern arch of the central square, with which the Gospel narrative opens. 75. Toqale, New Church (Jerphanion, op.cit., I, 2, p. 31 1); Sts. Apostles (ibid., II, i, pp. 68f.). 76. See above, p. 270. It is, indeed, possible that a linking of the New and Old Covenants was effected not only from the standpoint of the sanctuary, but from that of the nave as well. The last scene of the Old Testament cycle is Jacob's Struggle with the Angel. It is unusual for a Biblical cycle thus to break off halfway through the story of Jacob. In Monreale the Old Testament scenes occupy a far larger area, but instead of continuing the story beyond this point the artists preferred to fill the available space by telling the preceding events in greater detail. Jacob's Struggle with the Angel must have been considered particularly suitable to provide a final accent to the Old Testament series. In both churches the scene occupies a relatively large space and brings the cycle to an effective halt. Were Jacob's struggle and Simeon's willing submission considered as complementary episodes? Was the Nunc dimittis thought to be related to the Non dimittam te nisi benedixeris mihi? So far I have not found any evidence that the two scenes were ever linked together specifically. But Isidorus had already said of the angel's struggle with Jacob: Christi cer- tamen cum populo Israel figuravit ("Allegoriae quaedam Sacrae Scripturae," No. 30, Migne, PL, LXXXIII, col. 105). It is possible, then, that the two scenes on either side of the "divide" were selected especially to emphasize Christ's struggle with, and triumph over, the people of Israel. Was this another device aimed at the conversion of the Jews (see above p. 277 and footnote 47)? 77. Mal. III, i. The text is here transcribed after D. B. Gravina, II Duomo di Monreale, Palermo, 1859-, pl. I7D (--our Fig. 13). Strictly speaking the third word should read Mitto (see below, footnote 81). At present I cannot decide whether the change was introduced by the artist, by some later restorer, or by Gravina's copyist. 78. This statement is not intended to imply that liturgical usages of Rome can be assumed automatically to have been followed also in Norman Sicily. But the fact that in Monreale the text of Malachi is associated with the Presentation in the Temple is itself an indication that the Siculo-Norman liturgy shared with the Roman this particular detail, an assumption</page><page sequence="17">MOSAICS OF THE CAPPELLA PALATINA 283 had other associations aside from the liturgy of the feast. It is one of the principal messianic prophe- cies in the Old Testament and as such it was used in other contexts to hail the arrival of the heavenly king or his earthly representative. It is, in short, one of the principal adventus texts." Specifically, it figures frequently in ordines for the reception and coronation of rulers.80 It is not lacking in the one extant coronation ordo which has been attributed to Norman Sicily and which provides for the chanting of the Malachi prophecy during the king's solemn entry into the church."' The text, then, would always evoke visions of the king's advent and perhaps we are not stretching the evi- dence unduly when we suggest that this mental association extended also to the scene which the text accompanied. Admittedly we have no literary statement, aside from the indirect evidence de- rived from the prophecy of Malachi in Monreale, to prove that in twelfth century Sicily the Hypapante was still thought of in terms of the royal ceremony which had originally given it its name; we are, however, able to say that this meaning was preserved in mediaeval Greek literature.82 Granted even that for a spectator in Norman Sicily the royal element in the Hypapante may have been nothing more than a faint overtone and that these regal connotations may have provided only an incidental reason why the scene was prominently featured in the Palatine Chapel, there is still the fact that special emphasis was given also to two other scenes which definitely were thought of in terms of the ruler's adventus, namely, the Flight into Egypt and the Entry into Jerusalem. This fact should now be considered in conjunction with our earlier observations on the asymmetric layout of the christological cycle. Was not this cycle laid out to suit a particular viewpoint and, indeed, a particular spectator who could be no other than the king himself? The southern wall of the southern wing is the great picture wall of the sanctuary; its view is dominated by two adventus scenes, particularly by the Entry into Jerusalem, which has always impressed visitors as one of the climactic features of the whole decoration (Fig. I8). This would be the wall the king faced (Fig. 5). The corresponding wall in the northern wing, which presumably never carried the same weight iconographically, would be behind his back or out of his sight (Fig. 6). There is, of course, even now a window in the northern wing which affords exactly the view just referred to. If this window could be proved to be an original feature of the architecture the hypothesis here outlined would gain greatly in probability. Unfortunately, at present the evidence in regard to this window is inconclusive. It has been mentioned above that a royal box did exist in the northern wing in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. According to one authority this box, which was a wooden structure in front of the lower part of the northern wall, was in- stalled after the Bourbon court had moved to Palermo (A.D. 1798), because the small loggia higher up on that wall no longer sufficed.83 This statement would seem to imply that a small window which is all the more reasonable since the Sarum Missal also has the Malachi reading for the feast of the Presentation. This was pointed out to me by Dom A. Strittmatter. For the Sicilian affinities of the rite of Sarum, cf. E. H. Kantorowicz, "A Nor- man Finale of the Exultet and the Rite of Sarum," Harvard Theological Review, xxxiv, 1941, pp. i39f. It is interesting to note that in the Cappella Palatina the series of prophets in the central square is arranged in such a way that Malachi, though lacking a prophetic text, is placed next to the Hypapante (see Fig. 5). 79.

But at present there is no positive archaeological or documentary proof that it goes back to the twelfth century."8 Since the king's apartments were situated north of the Chapel, the northern wall of the sanctu- ary certainly would be a logical place for a royal loggia. Behind this wall lies an ambulatory which skirts the entire length of the Chapel on the north side,"s but there is some uncertainty as to the means of access to this ambulatory and to the Chapel from the royal apartments. Investigations recently carried out in this area have shown that there was a passage leading from the royal apart- ments to the ambulatory on the level of the crypt.8" But this does not exclude the possibility that there was a connection on a higher level as well, where the evidence has been obscured by later building activities." A seemingly strong argument against the assumption that there was in Norman times a royal seat in any part of the sanctuary is the existence of a royal throne at the western end of the nave (Fig. 12). But the style of the mosaics in the area surrounding the top of this throne and on the wall above it-admittedly difficult to judge because of drastic restorations-makes it doubtful, to say the least, whether this throne is an original feature of the church. The whole western wall may have undergone a very thorough reorganization at a relatively advanced period.88 Even if the throne at the western end were part of the original plan it would not really exclude the exist- ence of a royal seat in the area of the sanctuary as well. Unfortunately we know next to nothing about the Norman kings' role in the church service, but in view of their exceptional and quasi- clerical status as papal legates they are a priori likely to have had at least a movable seat within the sanctuary. Indeed, there are royal thrones within the chancel both in Cefalit and in Monreale. In our context it is interesting to note that in both these instances the thrones are on the northern side. A royal seat in the balcony, on the other hand, would have an altogether different function and would be used for private attendance as distinct from official participation in the service. The mosaic decoration itself provides corroborative evidence that the view across the sanctuary from north to south was indeed a royal view and that the king must have had a place on the northern side and, very probably, in what is even now a royal window. This corroborative evidence comes from the figures of saints which supplement the program. They provide a further curious case of asymmetry which has already been mentioned. On the outer face of the southern arch of the central square are three busts of prophets in medallions completing the series of prophets in the dome and central square. These are flanked, in the spandrels, by full-length figures of Isaiah and Joel with prophetic texts referring to adjoining New Testament scenes.89 The corresponding wall of the northern arch, i.e. the wall facing the royal loggia, also shows three busts in medallions flanked by two full-length figures. But of these five figures, four are prominent warrior saints. The full-length figure in the left-hand spandrel is Theodorus Tiro; the three busts depict Demetrius, Nestor, and Mercurius. The standing saint to the right is a bishop-a rather incongruous-looking figure in this company of warriors-and, in fact, no other than St. Nicholas, whom one is all the more surprised to find here since he is represented also among the holy bishops on the wall opposite. Evidently he is represented here not so much as one of the great Eastern bishops, but as one of the Italien, Dresden, i928, pl. 51. The monograph by Pasca, to which Boglino refers, was not accessible to me. 84. So far as I am aware, the only author who has stated expressis verbis that the window in the northern wing is a royal loggia of the period of Roger II is Di Marzo, Delle belle arti in Sicilia, II, p. 161 (see also below, footnote 92). Demus attributes it to a change of plan under William I. 85. Cf. the plan in Archivio storico siciliano, 1936, facing p. 474. 86. M. Guiotto, Palazzo Ex Reale di Palermo. Recenti restauri e ritrovamenti, Palermo, 1947, pp. 3 iff. and fig. 4 "c." 87. Guiotto, op.cit., pp. 32f. The author points out, however, that the passage shown on Valenti's plans in Bollettino d'arte, 2nd series, Iv, 1924-25, pp. 512f., figs. 1-2, is purely hypo- thetical. 88. Cf. F. Valenti's statement ("L'Arte nell'era normanna," II Regno normanno, Messina and Milan, 1932, p. 220) that the narthex to the west of this wall is an addition of the period of William II. Some authors have gone so far as to attribute the throne to the Aragonese period (Di Marzo, op.cit., II, pp. I6off.; Di Pietro, I Musaici siciliani, p. 73). 89.

Thus the view from north to south comprises yet another element which would appeal par- ticularly to a royal spectator and one, incidentally, which could hardly be appreciated from any other viewpoint except the window high up on the northern wall." The saints on the walls flanking this window give further emphasis to the royal and military theme. On the western wall (Fig. 16) Catherine in royal garb is flanked by Agatha and another female saint, whose name is lost. The group clearly suggests a queen or princess with her ladies-in-waiting." On the eastern wall is the group of the Virgin and Child and St. John, whose possible liturgical symbolism has already been discussed." Two peculiarities of this group remain to be mentioned. The first is the eccentric po- sition of the Virgin which is strange and disturbing when viewed from the front (Fig. 14), but not so when viewed from the loggia. This is in itself an indication that the loggia was already in existence when the mosaics were made." The other is the fact that this image of the Virgin and Child not only belongs to the Hodegetria type, iconographically speaking, but is actually inscribed MHP OY H OAHF-HTP IA. An inscription denoting an iconographic type is a very rare feature in monu- mental wall decoration prior to the late Byzantine period,96 though it is somewhat more common on seals" and coins." The implication in all such cases is that the image which bears the inscription depicts a specific icon." In this instance we have before us a representation of the famous icon of the Hodegetria in Constantinople, palladium of empire and dispenser of victory, prayed to by emperors and generals upon departing on their campaigns, thanked and praised for victories upon their return, and even carried on the ramparts in extreme emergencies.100 The cult of the Hodegetria had already been fostered by the Normans more than a generation before the mosaics of the Palatina were made. At the very beginning of the twelfth century the Abbey of Rossano, founded with the active support of the dynasty, was dedicated to the Virgin under the title of Nea Hodegetria.o"' Thus the view from the loggia offers on all three sides subjects with military and royal conno- 90.

The center of the cult of St. Nicholas was, of course, Bari. St. Theodorus Tiro, his pendant in the Cappella Palatina, was a patron saint of Brindisi (cf. Acta Sanctorum Novembris, Iv, p. 27). 9i. G. Anrich, Hagios Nikolaos, II, Leipzig and Berlin, 1917, P. 504; Meisen, op.cit., pp. 66, 89. The only miracle of the saint related by Philagathos (see above, footnote 68) in his Nicholas homily is a rescue at sea (Migne, PG, cxxxII, cols. 9o5ff.). The artist who aligned St. Nicholas with St. Theodore, St. Demetrius, etc., clearly did not share Anrich's view (op.cit., p. 496) that the "gentle bishop was not suited as a warrior saint." Anrich was not aware of the dual repre- sentation of St. Nicholas in the Cappella Palatina (cf. p. 484). For other bishops featured by our artists in what seems to be largely a military capacity, see below, p. 289. But although the duplication of the figure of St. Nicholas can be explained by drawing a distinction between the saint as a bishop and as a local and naval patron, the fact that the figure occurs twice within one and the same part of the church might be used as an argument that the two sets of mosaics were planned and executed at different times. If so, it would be the row of five holy bishops, and not the warrior saints, which would have to be detached from the program as a whole. For they differ from all the other mosaics in the transept in having name inscriptions in both Greek and Latin. For stylistic reasons, however, the difference in time cannot be very great. See also above, footnote 39. 92. Cf. the sections, Figs. 1, 2. A connection between the warrior saints and the royal window was drawn already by Di Marzo, op.cit., II, p. 76. The mosaics on the sidewalls of the chancel at Cefalui present a comparable case of asymmetry, clearly planned with the same intent. The four deacons de- picted in the second zone from below on the northern wall (Lasareff, ART BULLETIN, XVII, 1935, p. 203, fig. 15) are matched on the southern wall by four military saints: Theo- dore Stratelates, George, Demetrius, Nestor (ibid., p. 200, fig. 14). Here the relation to the king, whose throne faces the southern wall, can hardly be doubted. 93. This was observed by Mons. Pottino, op.cit. (above, footnote 8), p. 58. 94. See above, pp. 273f. 95.

Taking this fact in conjunction with the peculiar arrangement of the christological cycle one can hardly avoid the conclusion that the whole decoration was meant to gratify a royal spectator seated on the northern side and probably in the loggia. The view from north to south not only is richer than that from south to north, it shows a consistent and sustained emphasis on a single theme: royal power and glory. The theme is cleverly and semicryptically embedded in what is, to all intents and purposes, a normal Byzantine scheme of decoration. But it is present neverthe- less. It finds expression in the saints and single figures no less than in the prominent featuring of the adventus scenes and particularly in the Entry into Jerusalem, which forms a very effective center piece. The two saints flanking this scene will be discussed later, and it will be seen that they give additional emphasis to the royal theme. The view from south to north offers no such keynote and is by comparison disjointed. The asymmetry of the whole layout must be purposeful. It is the view from north to south which counts most, and it is from the loggia that it can best be appreciated. V An attempt must now be made to determine the date of this "royal program." This requires a digression into the realm of style, admittedly treacherous ground because of the thorough restora- tions to which the mosaics of the Cappella Palatina have been subjected at various times. It is still possible, however, to distinguish at least two stylistic groups among the mosaics in the dome and transept. These two groups can be characterized conveniently by means of a comparison of two busts of Christ, one in the dome, the other in the lunette of the Pentecost vault (Figs. 20, 21). Among the characteristics of the latter as against the former are a slimmer, more elongated face, larger eyes, a generally more ascetic expression, and a more elaborate drapery design with a prefer- ence for rounded forms. A key to the source of this second style is provided by the magnificent bust of Christ in the apse at Cefalfi (Fig. 22). The artist who designed the Christ in the Pentecost vault knew the work of that excellent atelier which decorated the apse in Cefali.The artists of the dome apparently did not. The dome bears an inscription of A.D. I 43,~o2 the mosaics in the apse at Cefalfi are dated by an inscription in the year I I148.'0 The natural conclusion is that work in the Palatine Chapel started in the dome in the early forties and that by the time the southern transept wing was reached the Cefalfi workshop had become operative and had started to exert its influence. Thus the mosaics in this area would seem to belong to the late forties at the earliest.'"' Another clue is provided by the church of the Martorana in Palermo, built by George of Antioch, the faithful admiral of Roger II, prior to the year I I143.'0 The mosaic decoration in the Martorana must have been, if not completed, at least far advanced when George died in A.D. I 151.6-r This decoration, however, is in part an abbreviated excerpt of that in the Cappella Palatina. A reverse relationship is hardly conceivable.1'0 Hence, those mosaics of the Palatine Chapel which are re- Ioz. See above, footnote 3. xo3. Lasareff, ART BULLETIN, XVII, 1935, p. I85. 104. The priority of the dome mosaics of the Cappella Palatina over the artistically superior mosaics in the apse at Cefalu~ has been a stumbling block to those who, like Lasareff (op.cit., pp. 22xff.), conceived the Sicilian development as a simple "one-way" process starting with a pure Constantino- politan style and undergoing a gradual provincialization. In actual fact the process is a good deal more complicated. The dome mosaics of the Cappella Palatina are important evidence of a school which worked for King Roger prior to the ar- rival of the Cefalfi workshop. It is only by making this dis- tinction that the full impact of the Cefalui workshop, as revealed in some of the mosaics of the southern wing of the Palatina, can be appreciated and the framework of a chronology for the Palatina mosaics can be established. 105.

Amari, Storia dei Musulmanni di Sicilia, 2nd ed., III, pt. 2, Catania, 1938, p. 429 (in the first edition, III, Florence, i868, p. 422, the date is given erroneously as 1149- 50). 107. This can be demonstrated, for instance, in the case of the Presentation in the Temple. The mosaic in the Cappella Palatina follows an established type represented in southern Italy by the eleventh century ivory paliotto in Salerno (D. C. Shorr, "The Iconographic Development of the Presentation in the Temple," ART BULLETIN, XXVIII, 1946, pp. i7ff. and fig. 9). In the Martorana the scene is repeated exactly, but simplified through the omission of Joseph, Anna, and the temple architecture. The Nativity scenes in the two churches are equally closely related and again the Martorana represents a reduced version (cf. Figs. 15 and I7).</page><page sequence="21">MOSAICS OF THE CAPPELLA PALATINA 287 flected in the decoration of the Martorana were probably in existence in the late forties. Among these are the Annunciation, the Presentation in the Temple, and the Nativity (Figs. 15, 17). The Nativity scene, however, clearly belongs to the second of the two groups which we have distinguished in the Cappella Palatina. Immediately above it is the Christ bust which betrays un- mistakably the influence of the Cefalh style. Immediately below is a bust of St. Paul, which, though very badly restored, still shows traces of the same Cefall influence, and, indeed, reproduces the drapery design of the Cefali Pantokrator (cf. Figs. 15, 22). The Nativity must have been exe- cuted simultaneously with the two busts between which it is bracketed. Thus this whole ensemble on the eastern wall of the southern wing is confined between very narrow chronological limits. Insofar as it shows the influence of the Cefalh workshop it can hardly be earlier than I145 at the very earliest; insofar as it, in turn, influenced the work in the Martorana it can hardly be later than I150 at the very latest. A date in the second half of the forties is thereby suggested for at least part of the mosaics of the second group. How much of the work belongs to the second group can be determined, if at all, only on the basis of a more adequate photographic record and a more thorough scrutiny of authentic and restored parts than are at present available. It is hazardous even to attempt to draw a line of demarcation between the first and the second groups. Probably all the work above the inscription of I I43, that is to say, in the dome and in the drum, belongs to the first group, with the possible exception of the eight half-length figures of prophets in the spandrels of the drum. These do not agree altogether with the figures in the dome and with the full-length figures of prophets in the niches of the drum. In the rounded forms of some of their draperies there may be an influence of the Cefali workshop. These half-length figures of prophets may, in fact, be an afterthought. They are awkwardly cut off at the waist and wedged into the narrow spaces between the niches (Fig. 5). If this conclusion is correct one might tentatively reconstruct the progress of the work somewhat as follows: When the dedicatory verses were inscribed at the foot of the drum in A.D. I I43 the Pantokrator with his angelic guards had already been placed or was about to be placed in the dome and two groups of four Evangelists and four prophets and forerunners in the squinches and niches below.l0s It was, as we have seen, a typical Byzantine dome decoration, but there need not neces- sarily have been at that stage the full plan of decoration for the lower parts as it was later carried out. Indeed, the original plan may have provided merely for a descending hierarchy of prophets, apostles and martyrs, somewhat on the lines of the decoration of the Nea, the palace church of the Byzantine emperors. There may have ensued a lull in the work which may have lasted until I 146 or I 147 when a new impetus came from the recently established workshop at Cefalui. Possibly the inclusion of a New Testament cycle in the program of the sanctuary was decided upon only at this time, and this may be the reason why the series of prophets, for which there would have been space originally in the lower parts, was crowded into the spandrels of the drum and of the arches beneath in the form of busts. Whether or not there was a change of plan, work on the mosaics in the lower parts of the sanctuary was in progress in the second half of the forties, when the southern wing was reached. How far the work progressed during this phase is difficult to say. What matters most in the present context is the probability that the over-all scheme of decoration was then established in its sub- stantially final form and that this scheme included the royal view across the transept from north to south. Annunciation, Nativity, and Presentation in the Temple must have been in existence by io8. The group of prophets and forerunners was intended perhaps as a representation of two pairs of fathers and sons: David and Solomon, Zacharias and John. Zacharias' scroll is inscribed with a quotation from the prophet of that name (Zach. ix, 9), but the censer in his hand seems to characterize him as Zacharias the Priest and father of the Baptist. The two were sometimes confused (Grabar, Martyrium, ii, p. 20o). In some of the marginal psalters (Vatican, Barb. gr. 372, fol. 235r; London, British Museum, Add. 19352, fol. I85r) the prophet Zacharias also appears with a censer.</page><page sequence="22">288 THE ART BULLETIN this time, since they are reflected in the Martorana. The Pentecost scene, or at least the figure of Christ which is part of it, must have been executed at the same time as the Nativity. It is hardly conceivable that these four scenes which comprise the beginning and the end of the "feast cycle" could have been allotted the places in which we find them unless there had been an over-all plan for such a cycle'"' and for its distribution over the transept, a distribution which, as we have seen, was far from haphazard and on the contrary extremely well thought out."0 The supporting pro- gram of saints certainly was evolved at the same time. It is complementary to the New Testament cycle so far as distribution is concerned. It has the same regal emphasis and it, too, has ties with the Martorana mosaics."' It was mentioned earlier that the over-all plan, as it existed in the second half of the forties, may have provided also for the Old Testament cycle in the nave,"2 even though most writers believe that this cycle, at any rate, was not executed until the reign of William I. We do not know how far the execution of the work had progressed when William I succeeded to the throne in A.D. I 154. But the over-all scheme of the mosaics, including the "royal view," was evolved, if not in the first phase of the work, certainly still within the reign of Roger II. In the sanctuary there is only one group of mosaics which seems to be altogether unconnected with this scheme, namely, the figures in the central apse. The Pantokrator appears here once more (Fig. 23) and although the figure is evidently derived from that in the conch at Cefalui (Fig. 22), we are here far removed from the latter's aristocratic countenance and ascetic proportions, which the artist of the Saviour in the Pentecost scene of the Palatina reproduced so faithfully (Fig. 21), and closer to the expansive and somewhat bloated Pantokrator bust of Monreale (Fig. 24) done under William II (I I66-1189). The Pantokrator in the apse of the Cappella Palatina must surely belong to the advanced twelfth century. It was placed there as an afterthought in order to offset the vertical build-up of the original Byzantine scheme of decoration-a scheme designed for churches with a centralized plan-and to give primary emphasis to the longitudinal axis of the basilica. This change of plan seems to have affected also the figures in the lower zone of the central apse."3 VI It was during the last decade of the reign of Roger II, greatest of the Norman rulers of Sicily, that the grand design for the mosaics in the sanctuary of the Palatine Chapel was evolved. This was the period when Roger, having finally become undisputed master within his own domain and having won the Pope's recognition of his kingship, stepped out onto the international scene and embarked on a course of open rivalry with the two greatest powers of his day, the Byzantine and the German Empires. It was a subtle political game punctuated by a number of warlike acts which culminated in A.D. I I47 in what seems to have been an attempt to oust the Comnenian dynasty and to set up a Latin Kingdom on the Bosphorus."4 The question arises whether the decoration of the sanctuary of the Cappella Palatina, with its stress on royal and military themes, was designed merely to enhance the courtly atmosphere of the church or whether it bears a specific relation to the events of those years. There is one feature in the decoration which has so far been neglected and which more clearly than any other indicates the presence of quite specific political overtones.

St. Denis and St. Martin would not be an obvious choice were it simply a question of opposing Latin Fathers to the Greek ones on the wall opposite. They do not seem to have held a particularly prominent place in the Sicilian calendar. But they were exceedingly prominent in France, and their connec- tion with France is, indeed, the principal bond between them. Denis was considered to have been the first bishop of Paris, or even the Apostle of Gaul, and since the Carolingian period he had been identified in Western thought with Dionysius the Areopagite."" Martin, of course, was a famous bishop of Tours. Both were traditional patrons of the French king and the French army and the nearest equivalent in France to the Byzantine warrior saints."' Both had given their names to fa- mous French flags."' St. Denis' role particularly had never been more brilliant-or more worldly- than in the twelfth century, by which time he was firmly established as France's patron saint. His military valor became evident to all France in I 124 when the saint's flag, raised from the altar of the Abbey Church of St. Denis by Louis VI, secured the successful defense of the realm against the threatened invasion of the German emperor."8 Twenty-three years later Louis VII, before em- barking on the Second Crusade, went to the Abbey of St. Denis and asked the Saint for his vexillum and for permission to leave qui mos semper victoriosis regibus fuit."' The place of honor given to the two saints on a wall otherwise dedicated entirely to the life of Christ must be understood as a tribute to France, her army, and her king. France was Roger's natural ally in his struggles with the two Empires and a special object of his attention since the early forties.2'0 He began to woo Louis VII openly during the preparations for the Second Crusade, which to Roger was but a thinly disguised scheme for the conquest of Constantinople. It was a joint Franco-Sicilian attack on the capital which he seems to have had in mind when he sent out his fleet in I 147.'?' In any case such a plan was being discussed at that time in Louis' entourage."' But Louis did not respond openly to Roger's offers of friendship until I149, when the Crusade had taken its disastrous course and the French king, now thoroughly disabused of the faithfulness of his Greek allies, was on his return journey. As a result of events which are not entirely clear Louis and his Queen found themselves landing on Norman shores. According to one version Louis was ambushed by a Byzantine fleet and rescued by the Normans.'23 Be this as it may, Roger, desiderans oportunitatem exhibendi devotionem quam habebat regi et regno Francoruml2 was able to play host to the French royal couple. Louis spent two months in Roger's kingdom."" We do not know that he visited Palermo, though his Queen did.'2 There was a confi- I 15. M.

Although we have no record of what transpired at this meeting, we may infer from subsequent correspondence that a plan was hatched for another crusade, this time with Roger as a leader and with Byzantium as an avowed objective.12' The plan petered out because of opposition from the pope. Relations with France continued to be friendly, but active political cooperation had ended for the time being. Thus, a tribute to France would have been particularly appropriate in the period before, during and immediately after the Second Crusade. As we have seen, mosaicists were working in the south- ern wing of the Cappella Palatina at precisely this period. Indeed, in the light of the events of those years the appearance of the two patron saints of the French king and the French army on either side of the triumphal scene of the Entry into Jerusalem is peculiarly suggestive. But without additional evidence it would be hazardous to try to connect this group of mosaics with any specific event. In any case, however, the prominent featuring of the two saints not only adds another regal and military element to the "royal view," it also shows that political considerations were not foreign to the designers of the mosaic program. No doubt the choice of a Byzantine form of decoration is itself a political gesture which must likewise be seen in the light of Roger's political aspirations. On the one hand it befits a ruler who, as a papal legate, occupied a position almost unique in the Western world. Roger certainly conceived his role within his own kingdom as being closely com- parable to that of the basileus with its combination of secular and spiritual overlordship. On the other hand the Byzantine decoration also betokens his ambitions in the international field. Indeed, it was perhaps primarily as a potential usurper of the imperial crown that Roger, who allowed himself to be addressed and portrayed as a basileus,'2 laid claim to a Byzantine setting. Yet, if the interpretation of these mosaics which has been offered in the foregoing pages is ac- cepted it must also be conceded that Roger's artists have used Byzantine church decoration in a manner in which it hardly could have been used by any basileus. There were, to be sure, in Byzan- tium close ties between religious and imperial iconography. Christian art in its formative stage had borrowed from imperial imagery many motifs which helped to underline its own triumphal character.1O0 In the period after the iconoclastic controversy the barriers separating the two spheres broke down to a large extent. The emperor was usually depicted in the company of sacred figures.13' The celestial choirs were cast firmly in the mold of a court hierarchy. The hierarchical principles which govern all Byzantine imagery are nowhere more apparent than in the system of church decoration. But this system is timeless and impersonal. It is an embodiment of a Christian cosmos. The details of the arrangement may differ from case to case and the symbolical interpretations may also vary.'132 But the hierarchy of images always stands for an objective order and helps to make of the church a symbol of the Christian universe and the economy of Salvation. In this system the footnote. According to the Anonymus ad Petrum, Louis him- self also visited Palermo, whither he was conducted by Roger with great honors (Occurrit ergo ei et adductis equitaturis ad sufficienciam perduxit eum Panormiam cum summo honore, et tam illum quam omnes suos multis donariis studuit honorare, op.cit., p. I9). This passage, however, has been discounted by historians (cf. Kugler, op.cit., pp. 2zof. n. 15), and probably rightly, since Louis himself, in his letters to Suger (Recueil, xv, pp. 513, 518), makes no mention of such a visit. A farcical account of the French King's alleged visit to Palermo is given by Bernardus Thesaurarius (thirteenth century) in his Liber de Acquisitione Terrae Sanctae, ch. cxxvI (L. A. Muratori, Rerum Italicarum Scriptores, vil, Milan, 1725, cols. 766f.). 127.

The arrangement in the Cappella Palatina is not objective, but sub- jective. It is designed to gratify the king, who apparently was to find reflected in the sacred images his own militant power and his own real and anticipated triumphs. The use of religious imagery for such purposes is not altogether foreign to Byzantium.'34 But one may doubt whether in a Byzantine church sacred icons depicting the incarnate life of Christ or choirs of saints could have been used in this fashion. The Normans failed to understand or chose to ignore the true role of the icon in a Byzantine church, namely, to serve as a mystic enactment of a body of eternal and universal truths on which the empire was founded and of which the emperor was the principal custodian. Instead, the Normans made of at least part of the church decoration a paean to the king. Since their adoption of Byzantine imagery was probably bound up from the outset with practical politics, this change of emphasis is perhaps only logical.'35 At present this interpretation of the mosaics in the Cappella Palatina can be proposed only as a hypothesis. It will remain a hypothesis as long as there is so much uncertainty on basic archaeo- logical questions, such as the date of the loggia in the northern wing of the transept and the degree to which restorers may have falsified the style of certain mosaics crucial to the establishment of a secure chronology. Even an inquiry which, like the present one, is concerned only with the broad layout of subject matter must remain tentative until a firm basis can be provided by a close investi- gation of archaeological details. Meanwhile, however, the interpretation offered in these pages can perhaps claim a certain inner plausibility. It is in keeping with the "enlightened" atmosphere of King Rogers court'36 and its sober and practical approach to religious matters.'7 Where there were so many different peoples and creeds religious dogma could not play the role of a universal and objective norm which it played in Byzantium. The state became viable only on the basis of extreme religious tolerance, avoidance of theological argument, and an extraordinary emphasis on the person of the ruler. It is not surprising to find religious imagery also pressed into the service of this central idea. The phenomenon has a striking parallel in certain liturgical formulae which have been ascribed to Norman Sicily and which likewise display an unprecedented concentration on the royal person and the royal theme.'38 Furthermore, what we have found in the Sicilian mosaics perhaps is related to other phenomena in Western art of the same period. The boldest innovation in the design of Abbot Suger's new fagade of the Abbey Church of St. Denis, royal burial church and symbolic if not actual seat of power of the French monarchy, was the prominent representation, in the form of column statues, of Biblical kings and queens, who were antecedents not only of Christ but of the 133.

Weitzmann, The Joshua Roll, Princeton, 1948, pp. i 3f.). i35. The portrayal of Roger II in the Martorana offers an analogous phenomenon; cf. my forthcoming paper quoted in footnote 129 above. It should be emphasized that the presence of un-Byzantine elements in the program of the mosaics in the Cappella Palatina, which this analysis has disclosed, does not, or at least not necessarily, have any bearing on the question of whether or not the executing artists were Byzantines. A clear distinction must be made between the design of the program (i.e. the choice of subjects and their distribution in the church) and the work on the mosaics themselves. 136.

Kantorowicz' analysis of the Laudes of Palermo, which he ascribes to Norman times (Laudes Regiae, pp. i57ff.): "There is no haggling over . . . symbols of spiritual or secular supremacy. Here the state has engulfed the Church. . . It is the idea of royal absolutism in its then harshest form. . . ." Cf. also the same author's discussion of a South Italian variant of the finale of the Exultet, which he ascribes to the early twelfth century and which includes the martial triad . . . vivis, regnas, imperas . . . Jhesu Christe reminiscent of the Christus vincit, Christus regnat, Christus imperat of the Laudes Regiae (Harvard Theological Review, 1941, PP. I29ff.).</page><page sequence="30">292 THE ART BULLETIN French kings as well. The theme was taken over soon afterwards at Chartres on the portal that is known even now-and was known already in the Middle Ages-as the Portail Royal.1"9 The comparison with St. Denis and Chartres cannot, of course, be sustained on the level of con- crete detail either iconographic or stylistic. It concerns such elusive factors as the thoughts which may have motivated the designers of these programs and their mental attitudes towards religious imagery and its role in the church building. Scientific precision is difficult to achieve in such matters. Yet it is probably true to say that the mosaics of the Cappella Palatina, however Byzantine they may be in appearance, bear the imprint of a spirit ultimately more akin to the courtly and worldly atmos- phere of the Ile de France than to the politico-religious mysticism of the Eastern Empire. 139.
