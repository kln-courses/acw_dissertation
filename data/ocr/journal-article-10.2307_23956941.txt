<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Anti-anthropomorphisms of the Greek Pentateuch, by Charles T. Fritsch. Pp. viii + 8i. Princeton: University Press; London: Milford, 1943. 13s. 6d. This work is a study of two sets of phenomena in the Greek Pentateuch : the elimination or modification of statements in the Hebrew which attribute to God human form, human attributes, or human emotions ; and the modification or removal of statements which, in a more general way are thought to be derogatory to the majesty or out of keeping with the revealed character of God. Dr. Fritsch points out that hitherto there has been more speculation about the origins of these alterations than exact and complete information about their nature, numbers, and distribution. The purpose of his book is to set out the facts. He has done this for the Greek Pentateuch in a very thorough way. The work may be extended to other parts of the Greek Bible or to other versions of the Pentateuch—and it is to be hoped that this will happen. Dr. Fritsch's work will not need to be done again. The classification covers the alteration of anthropomorphisms and anthropopathies in the strict sense, omissions and alterations of the</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 79 name of God, denials of motion and place to God, the toning down of expressions deemed not ' spiritual ' enough, the introduction of inter mediary elements between God and mundane affairs, and a residue of examples which do not fall into any of the previous classes. In each case the method is to give the Hebrew and Greek texts with translations and explanatory comment. The one fact that emerges most clearly from this survey of a limited part of the field is the necessity for the greatest caution in stating con clusions. At first sight it seems that everybody indulged in this form of revision of the text, and that nobody did it systematically. Some parts of the Hebrew text are less anthropomorphic than others. Some of the old tiqqûnë sôphërïm are clearly designed to remove anthropo morphisms. In the Greek version some books of the Pentateuch are more thoroughly revised than others: a great deal has been done in Exodus, comparatively little in Genesis and Leviticus (Fritsch, p. 62). Even in the manuscripts of the LXX there are differences : Dr. Fritsch (in Appendix I) brings evidence to show that Β is more anti-anthropo morphic than A. And of the versions other than the LXX, Symmachus has more anti-anthropomorphisms than Aquila or Theodotion (Appen dix II). It is clear that the impulse to avoid or remove anthropomorphisms is not necessarily bound up with intensity of religious experience, for the prophets, who are second to none in this respect, do not avoid anthropomorphic expressions. On the other hand it is not diffi cult to suppose that the strong piety and deep reverence, which grew out of the prophetic experiences, found the prophetic language too daring for common men. If I am not mistaken, a parallel pheno menon may be observed in the early Church, where the 'abbâ of Jesus and Paul quickly gives way to the Our Father who art in heaven' of Jewish piety. There is a constant strain between the fact that human terms are inadequate to express God and the fact that they are the best terms available this side of Jordan. The problem becomes most acute in the doctrine of the Incarnation. Hitherto there have been two schools of thought regarding the origins of the anti-anthropomorphic tendency in the Jewish treatment of the Old Testament. Some hold that it is the working out of an integral factor in Judaism itself; others that the main impetus comes from Jewish contacts with Greek thought. Dr. Fritsch has his own sugges tion, one that is attractive in itself and well supported by his collection of data. He recognizes 'two streams of anti-anthropomorphic develop ment in Jewish history. One goes its own way through the Old Testament into the Rabbinical period, confined to the Hebrew and Aramaic languages, and guided by ritualistic and theological develop ments within Judaism. The other, resulting from contact with Greek</page><page sequence="3">8o THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES thought and idiom, continues until it becomes identified with the abstractions of Alexandrian philosophy ' (p. 65). The LXX shows the beginnings of the Greek influence ; but that influence is curbed bv the fact that the work is a translation, which the Seventy were concerned to make as accurate and faithful as possible. Besides the collection of the evidence and the drawing of the above inferences, there are a number of very interesting by-products of the main investigation. One may be mentioned: the various Greek ren derings of the Hebrew peh in Numbers. There are cases where the word is used figuratively to mean 'command' or the like. In these cases the LXX rendering is ρήμα, πρόσταγμα, or φωνη. Dr. Fritsch notes that φωνη is thus used only in Numbers and that this 'points to a different translator' (p. 13). He might have gone farther; for φωνη is confined to the first thirteen chapters. From xiv to xxxiii. 2 ρημα is used, while πρόσταγμα occurs three times in chapter ix and again in xxxiii. 38 and xxxvi. 5. (In 1. 2 of n. 13 on p. 13 ix. 20 should be added to the list of references.) Dr. Fritsch has made a valuable contribution to the history of Jewish theology as well as to the critical study of the Pentateuch. T. W. Manson</page></plain_text>
