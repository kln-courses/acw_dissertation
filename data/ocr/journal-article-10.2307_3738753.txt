<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRINCE POLI &amp; SAVANT': GOETHE'S PROMETHEUS AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT In the history of modern literature, certain classical myths seem readily to suggest themselves as figures of identification. Not mere frequency, but the cumulative significance attributed to these myths makes them constant points of reference. George Steiner thus locates the modern importance of the Antigone myth in a period between 'the 1790s and the start of the twentieth century*. After 1905, 'under pressure of Freudian reference, critical, interpretative focus had shifted to the Oedipus Rex'.1 What may seem like a marginal change of taste from one Sophoclean tragedy to another marks rather something like a paradigm-shift. Within a canonical body of texts known as classical mythology, they each offer distinct ways of cultural and political identification. A further and earlier such cultural identification is offered by the Prometheus myth in the (late) eighteenth century.2 Goethe made not one but four attempts at the myth, yet all but the poem remained fragments. Other scattered references to Prometheus throughout Goethe's works speak of his sustained preoccupa? tion with the story. Carrying an already heavy baggage of literary treatments from antiquity through the Renaissance and up to the eighteenth century, the myth offered several angles from which it could be approached.3 Without be? ing able to pinpoint direct responses to Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound (the only one extant of his three Prometheus tragedies)4 in Goethe's 'Prometheus', some critics read his belated reworking as 'den zweiten groBen Gipfel der Stoffgeschichte'.5 Retelling the old story of Prometheus, Goethe comes to stand shoulder to shoulder with Aeschylus. Although Goethe's Iphigenie auf Tauris is more fully developed in its retelling of the Tantalus myth and in its formal approximation of Attic tragedy, the scattered fragments make Prometheus and not Iphigenie Goethe's 'personliches Symbol',6 as Kommerell has it, and in I thank Dr Paul Kerrv and Professor T.

Denis Feeney speaks of how most contemporary readings of classical myths 'begin and end in naturalistic realism, with a token circuit en route through the divine agency, as if the divine element in the narrative is some? thing to be read through, purged, in a reading which arrives at acute novelistic insights'.8 This reading will try to take Prometheus and the gods at, as it were, their face value, seeing them not as embodiments of something else, but as mythological characters that can be distilled neither from the narrative nor from the history of their reception. The 'Sinn des Gedichts', as one recent critic has it (Gaier, p. 154), is not to be sought merely where the poem, on a su- perfieial level, may contradict earlier accounts, but in its reworking and further development of the mythological tradition, at the forefront of which Goethe's poem establishes itself. The poem stands out as the pinnacle of Goethe's early hymns that represent and engage with ancient gods. 'Prometheus', like 'Ganymed', already presents itself as a Rollengedicht, where the title establishes the main role as a mytho? logical one. Unlike 'Ganymed', however, the first person will stick closely to the mythological role established in the title. The voice of the speaker in the poem is always that of Prometheus.9 The poem opens with an initial imperative directed at Zeus that is matched by an insistent 'ich' (1. 56) at the end of the last section. Where hymns traditionally invoke gods by listing their attributes and relating stories of their cult, Goethe's poem presents a god who insists on telling his own story (Roscher, Lexikon, 111/2, 2032). Where the speaker of hymns is traditionally and necessarily human, this poem presents a god raving against other gods. In eighteenth-century aesthetics a hymn is defined as 'une louange a l'honneur de quelque divinite' and ia recompense, le salaire des immortels'.10 Where hymns thus are traditionally 'Lobgesange' and their 'herrschender Affekt ist Andacht, und anbetende Bewunderung',11 this poem is full of accusations against the gods?perhaps not the salary to which immortals are accustomed. It has therefore recently been suggested that 'Prometheus' should be read as an Antihymne' that negates, or defies, the gods in a language and form that hymns employ to invoke and praise them.12 In that sense the poem appropriates a form in order to undo the work to which that form has traditionally been put.13 7 Ulrich Gaier, 'Vom Mythos zum Simulacrum: Goethes "Prometheus"-Ode ,Lessing-Jahrbuch, i (1991), 147-67 (p. 163): 'ein Schlusseltext fur das ausgehende 18.

Wellbery, The Specular Moment: Goethe's Early</page><page sequence="3">396 Goethe's Prometheus and the Enlightenment Radically recoding the genre of hymns, 'Prometheus' is not a song of praise for that god, but his own song of blame against other gods. Taken out of its dramatic context, the poem becomes a Rollengedicht that speaks not only through the role of Prometheus, but moreover through the language of hymns. As if the title had not spelt it out already, the opening section makes it imme? diately clear that the poetic speaker has left the traditional world of eighteenth- century German lyrical poetry for the Greek pantheon:14 Bedecke deinen Himmel Zeus Mit Wolkendunst! Und ube Knabengleich Der Disteln kopft, An Eichen dich und Bergeshohn! MuBt mir meine Erde Doch lassen stehn. (11. 1-7) The first line with its initial imperative and the naming of the god irreverently scraps the traditionally elaborate invocations of gods in hymns. Prometheus im? mediately assumes a superior position from which he condescendingly grants Zeus some of his ancient attributes as weather-god. These attributes are already found in Homer, where the father of the gods is repeatedly given the epithets KeXatve^rjs (Iliad, xxi. 520, 'shrouded in black clouds'), Alos ovpos {Odyssey, v. 176, 'fair wind of Zeus'), and repiriKepavvos (Iliad, I. 419, 'delighting in thun- der').15 Oak-trees (Iliad, vn. 60) and mountain tops, perhaps here suggestive of Mount Olympus, are also Homeric in their association with Zeus (Heden, pp. 56-57). Echoing a passage from Ossian,16 the section makes Zeus's powers seem little more than childlike exercises in material destruction.17 Zeus in the opening section cuts a rather sorry figure whose powers are fading (Weimar, p. 89). The antagonism between the first person (Prometheus) and the second- person addressee (Zeus or the gods in general) not only defines the position of the speaker, but also structures the whole poetic argument. The division of heaven and earth, on Prometheus's terms, is stated almost as a historical neces? sity ('MuBt', 1. 6) that Zeus will have to come to accept in time. What made such a division possible or necessary in the first place is only implied in the poem.

The division of power between Prometheus and Zeus is even more precarious in the fragment since Zeus, in a radical reinterpretation of the mythological tradition, is here seen as Prometheus's father.18 Acting as an emissary for the gods, his brother Epimetheus explains the gods' proposal of peace to Prometheus: Sie wollen dir Olympus Spitze raumen Dort sollst du wohnen Sollst der Erde herrschen. (Prom.y 11. 64-66) It seems remarkable that the gods themselves agree, and not for the first time, to relinquish most of their powers to Prometheus. The poem and the fragment both presuppose a situation where Prometheus has already established his own power over the gods, a power so strong that they are eager to negotiate an understanding with him. Prometheus, however, is not satisfied with the pro? posal of the gods. In an almost Epicurean fashion, he relegates the gods to a region where they cease to have any influence over human lives. As a demiurge Prometheus lays absolute claim to the world he has created (Pront., 1. 90): 'Hier meine Welt, mein All!'19 Holding the Prometheus drama up against the poem is problematic, how? ever, since there is still some debate over the genesis of the two. Goethe's 'Prometheus' shares with his later 'Mahomets Gesang' the ambiguity of form, being at the same time both part of a dramatic fragment and an independent hymn. Gundolf (p. 129) reads the Prometheus poem as a condensation of the mythological material from the abandoned drama fragment, and recent schol? ars have also come to accept that the drama was written before the poem.20 The condensation of the drama into the poem changes the presentation of the Prometheus myth from the discursive mode of drama to the deictic mode of hymns. The drama has gods and at a later stage also humans discussing with each other. As if in a literary salon of the Enlightenment, gods and humans alike engage in discussion, trying to reason their way to an understanding of human society and religion. In the poem all this gentle reasoning is swept away by Prometheus's soliloquy. The dialogues of the drama are condensed into a single monologue, and the different perspectives offered in the drama are collapsed into the single perspective of Prometheus. By making Zeus and the gods speechless and granting them only a few theatrical manifestations of their one-time power, Prometheus pushes them towards the edge of his world. Recalling again the poem's genesis from the drama, the gods seem to fade into 18 Hans Blumenberg, Arbeit am Mythos, 2nd edn (Frankfurt a.M.: Suhrkamp, 1979), p. 578, claims, implausibly, that Goethe did this out of ignorance of the myth. 19 Text in MA, 1/1, 669-80. 20 MA, 1/1, 868-70, 'Kommentar'; Goethe-Handbuch,ed. by Regine Otto and Bernd Witte, 4 vols (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1996), 1, 107; unequivocally Reinhardt, 'Prometheus', p. 146 n. 55; Weimar, Goethes Gedichte, p. 94; Rolf Christian Zimmermann, Das Weltbild desjungen Goethe: Studien zur hermetischen Tradition des deutschen 18.

This is how the poem begins. The second section21 continues in the vein of the opening by point ing to the technical skills that the gods have now come to envy him: Und meine Hutte Die du nicht gebaut, Und meinen Herd Um dessen Glut Du mich beneidest. (11. 8-12) A chain of synecdoches links the two sections closely together: what begins with his 'Erde' (1. 6) in the first section ties in with 'Hiitte' (1. 8) in the second, followed by 'Herd' (1. 10) and finally 'Glut' (1. n). This concentric move from a more general concept to a more specific one outlines the structure of Prometheus's world down to its glowing centre. Where the opening section balances Zeus's heaven with Prometheus's earth, the second establishes his cultural achievements as evidence of human self-reliance. The hut with its hearth is a central topos of idyllic poetry, and in Goethe's own near-contemporaneous idyll 'Der Wanderer', the young woman leads the wanderer to her hut. When he finally takes his leave, he has a visionary fantasy of one day being able to return to his own hut.22 In 'Prometheus' the hut, with hearth and fire, not only stands as a place of refuge, but also comes as the first sign of humans domesticating nature. In the drama, Prometheus gives the first humans he has made handy instructions on how to build huts: 'Hier lieber Sohn ein Schutz und eine Hutte' (Prom., 266). On a very practical level, the hut will protect humans from the vagaries ofthe weather and thus from the last manifestations of divine power. On a different level, the construction of huts and domestication of fire suspend the physical necessity and allow humans to carve out an existence for themselves. From being subject to nature's, and in this case the gods', will, humans now become the lawgivers of nature. Blumenberg similarly notes (p. 331): 'Wenn man weiB, wie Feuer gemacht wird, ist man gegen Gotterzorn resistent geworden.' Prometheus the fire-bringer thus also becomes a figure of identification for the European Enlightenment, not only metaphorically shedding the light of human reason on religion and superstition, but also practically initiating hu? mans into the arts and crafts (Blumenberg, p. 644). Most eighteenth-century texts emphasize Prometheus's role in engineering technological, and thus so? cial, progress. A recurrent interpretation of the myth, as a so-called moral allegory, is of Prometheus as an exiled prince in savage Scythia. Prometheus teaches the primitive Scythians to make use of fire and helps them set up the 21 The MA, following MS M (Einzelhandschrift g in Mercks Nachlass), have 11. 8-12 as a separate section, all other (later) MSS have 11. 1-12 as one section; critical apparatus in Goethes Werke (Weimarer Ausgabe), ed. by Gustav von Loeper and others, 143 vols (Weimar: Bohlau: 1887-1919), 11 (1888), 312-13 (hereafter WA). 22 Cf.

Promethee, prince poli &amp; savant, leur apprit a mener une vie plus humaine, c'est peut-etre ce qui a fait dire qu'il avoit forme 1'homme.24 Perhaps under pressure still from the biblical Genesis,25 Prometheus is not seen as the creator of humans, but as their educator (Blumenberg, p. 356). The whole notion of creating is studiously avoided in all its lexical forms, in both French and German texts.26 Plato had already established the myth as an allegory of technological in? novation and political formation in the Protagoras (320C-323 c). The earliest and most important Renaissance mythographer, Giovanni Boccaccio, builds on Plato's allegorical reading to square the two accounts of creation.27 His careful and sympathetic reading of the myth in the light of the Scriptures would sig- nificantly determine the way it was interpreted well into, or perhaps especially in, the European Enlightenment (Trousson, p. 88). Boccaccio's reading relies on an important and far-reaching distinction between two kinds of creators and accordingly between two kind of creatures: 'Quique deus duplex est: sicut duplex est homo: qui producitur [. . .] Est enim homo naturalis: &amp; est homo ciuilis: ambo tamen anima rationali uiuentes' ('And just as God is twofold, so is man, whom he brought forth, twofold [. . .] For there are natural beings and social beings, and both live endowed with a rational soul'). The distinction be? tween natural and social beings allows Boccaccio to assign different roles to the biblical creator and to Prometheus. The mythological creator is thus credited with educating humans and raising them from their natural state: 'eos tamquam lapideos suscipiens quasi de nouo creat: docet: &amp; instruit: &amp; demonstrationibus suis ex naturalibus hominibus ciuiles facit moribus: scientia: &amp; uirtutibus in- signes' ('Taking them up as if they were blocks of stone, he creates them anew, so to speak, teaches and instructs them, and through his examples he makes civilized beings out of natural beings, distinguished by character, skill, and virtue').28 23 Encyclopedie, xiii (1765), 446, Tromethee'; cf.

This progress is underpinned both by technical innovations and by the importance it places on education and free discussion. Prometheus, in Boccaccio's reading, comes to prefigure some of the key elements of Enlightenment belief in such universal progress. Thus in Biirger's poem 'Prometheus', the fire stolen from the gods be? comes a symbol, although ambiguous, ofthe Allfreie Denk- und Druckerei'.29 Goethe's drama similarly begins only after Prometheus has already crafted his statues and concentrates largely on his teaching them how to build housing, how to distribute private property,30 and how to understand the finality of hu? man life. The stealing of the fire is not mentioned in the drama and only implied in the poem by the significant position of the glowing embers in the hearth and, im? portantly, as the object of Zeus's envy. In Hesiod (Theogony, 563-69; Works and Days, 50-52) Prometheus twice steals fire from the gods, after Zeus first takes it away from humans to punish them. In the various accounts ofthe myth since Hesiod (Theogony, 613-17) the (second) stealing ofthe fire is explicitly seen as the crime for which Prometheus is punished on the Caucasian rock and has his liver torn out by an eagle.31 That is, of course, the starting point for Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound. Whether Goethe had actually studied the original, or only knew of it through Hederich and other mythological handbooks, is still the matter of some debate. Had he studied the tragedy, it would be all the more significant that Prometheus, in his own drama and poem, on the contrary is not bound. The creating, or moulding as it is, of humans and the stealing of the fire go unpunished in Goethe's accounts of the myth. In the drama, the Caucasian mountain looms only in the distant background. A 23-line drama project of about 1793 is characteristically entitled 'Die Befreiung des Prometheus' (MA, iv/i, 191). In a line that is evocative more of Lucian than of Aeschylus, Zeus is said to be envious of the embers in Prometheus's hearth.32 In Lucian's dialogue Prometheus, the punished god is given a chance to defend himself in front of Hermes and Hephaestus while they wait for the eagle to arrive. Almost face- tiously Prometheus asks why it was wrong to steal the fire from the gods, 'denn ihr braucht es nicht, indem euch nicht friert, indem ihr nicht Ambrosia backt'.33 29 Gottfried August Biirger, Sdmtliche Werke, ed. by Gunter and Hiltrud Hantzschel (Munich: Hanser, 1987), p. 311, 'Prometheus', 1. 15. 30 Always a stumbling block for Marxist criticism; cf. Wruck, 'Die gottverlassene Welt', p. 518; Joachim Muller, 'Goethes Hymnen "Prometheus" und "Ganymed"', in Muller, Neue Goethe- Studien (Halle: Niemeyer, 1969), pp. 51-67 (p. 65). 31 Cf. Faust I, MA, vi/i, 579, 11. 1635-36: 'Hor auf, mit deinem Gram zu spielen, | Der wie ein Geier dir am Leben friBt!'; Iphigenie auf Tauris, MA, iii/i, 207, 11. 1712-16: 'O daB in meinem Busen nicht zuletzt | Ein Widerwille keime! der Titanen, j Der alten Gotter tiefer HaB auf euch, | Olympier, nicht auch die zarte Brust | Mit Geierklauen fasse!' 32 Gaier, 'Vom Mythos', importantly stresses the poem's relation to the satirical treatments of the myth by Lucian (second century ad); cf. Blumenberg, Arbeit am Mythos, pp. 374-75; Franz Saran, Goethes Mahomet und Prometheus (Halle: Niemeyer 1914), p. 84. 33 Lucian, Prometheus, 18; translation in Johann Christoph Gottsched, Lucians von Samosata auserlesene Schriften (Leipzig: Breitkopf, 1745), pp. 14-27, 'Prometheus, oder Kaukasus', p. 24.</page><page sequence="8">JONAS J0LLE 4OI Lucian spins his dialogues off the mythological tradition, but he juxtaposes different accounts and teases out their contradictions in order to expose the absurdity of the gods, or at least as they are presented in epic poetry. Goethe's own satirical dialogue Gotter, Helden und Wieland is based on the model of Lucian's dialogues, a model also used by Wieland in his Gottergesprdche34 and to an extent in his earlier 'Traumgesprach mit Prometheus', in some ways a model for Goethe's drama.35 More specifically, certain passages in Goethe's poem also echo some of the arguments against the gods in Lucian's Iuppiter confutatus, Iuppiter tragoedus, and the already mentioned Prometheus. While Ulrich Gaier rightly acknowledges the influence of Lucian, he sees the relationship between envious Zeus and Prometheus as 'mythologisch ab? surd'.36 Gaier's argument relies on what he perceives as an unequivocally clas? sical mythology, immutable accounts fixed once and for all in antiquity. A more flexible understanding of mythology would perhaps see these stories as part of a canonical body of texts, constantly reinterpreted and optimized through the selective mechanisms of reception. Gaier also ignores another important in? stance ofthe god's envy ofthe stolen fire in Goethe's works. In his adaptation of Aristophanes' Birds he makes two references to Prometheus that are warranted by the Greek comedy, where the god even appears as a character in the play. In Goethe's version, 'Treufreund' persuades the birds to seize power in the sky: 'Hatte Prometheus, als ein weiser vorsichtiger Vater, statt des so sehr beneideten Flammchens; seinen Menschen Flugel gegeben.'37 Although written a few years after Trometheus', this passage reveals the same relationship of power between Prometheus and the gods whose fire he has stolen as in the second section of the poem. Thus Zeus envying Prometheus his embers can be read as pushing the tra? ditional elements of the myth to their logical extreme. If possession of fire was a punishable crime in Hesiod, because it enables humans to live independently of the gods, the consequence of such independence is found in an enlightened society questioning the authority of the gods. As a further and almost absurd consequence, the gods now come to envy humans the life they have carved out for themselves. In Lucian, Prometheus makes a similar complaint about the fire: 'Das ist aber offenbar Neid, dasjenige, denen die es brauchen, nicht geben lassen wollen.'38 It is almost as if one could see Zeus standing outside the hut freezing, while Prometheus pulls up a chair in front of the fire. 34 Christoph Martin Wieland, Sdmmtliche Werke, ed. by Johann Gottfried Gruber, 50 vols (Leipzig: Goschen, 1818-28), xxvn (1822), 189-344: 'Gottergesprache I-X'; Werke, xl (1826), 311-402: 'GottergespracheXI-XIII'. 35 Wieland's 'Traumgesprach' is part of his philosophical essay 'Uber die von J. J. Rousseau vorgeschlagenen Versuche den wahren Stand der Natur des Menschen zu entdecken', in Wieland, Werke, xxxi (1822), 57-108. In Wieland's dialogue, by contrast, Prometheus remains bound, the interlocutor is human and Prometheus is presented as the (first) creator of humans. 36 Gaier, 'Vom Mythos', p. 156; criticism of Gaier in Wellbery, The Specular Moment, p. 294 n. 13, and in Goethe-Handbuch, 1, 114. 37 Die Vo'gel: Nach dem Aristophanes, MA, 11/1, 331,11. 28-31; cf. 328, 11. 12-15, 'soll dies Volk, so unwurdig von der Erde genahrt zu werden, die ihnen durch den Diebstahl des Prometheus verraterisch zugewandte Herrschaft so miBbrauchen'. 38 Lucian, Prometheus, 18; translation in Gottsched, Lucians Schriften, p. 25, cf.

The last synecdoche completes the concentric move from earth down to its glowing centre. Later in the poem, Prometheus will establish his 'heilig gluhend Herz' (1. 32) as the (imaginary) centre of his existence. Similarly in 'Wanderers Sturmlied', the 'innre Glut' (1. 55) comes to define the symbolic position of the Genius. By pointing to the glowing centre of his world and later within himself, Prometheus seeks to ground a world-order in human rather than transcendental experience. After emphatically addressing Zeus in the first two sections, Prometheus now turns to all the gods: Ich kenn nichts armers Unter der Sonn als euch Gotter. Ihr nahret kummerlich Von Opfersteuern und Gebetshauch Eure Majestat, und darbtet waren Nicht Kinder und Bettler Hoffnungsvolle Toren. (11. 13-19) Here again the poem manifests itself as an 'anti-hymn' by the invectives thrown out at the gods and by a complete lack of Andacht, und anbetende Bewunderung' (Sulzer, 11, 336). Instead of praising the deeds ofthe gods and invoking their protection, this poem criticizes the gods and the way in which they are worshipped. Wellbery speaks ofthe 'essentially juridical thrusf (p. 292, his emphasis) of the poem as a whole, where sections 1-3 give the accusation against Zeus and the gods, sections 4-8 substantiate that accusation with a narration of Prometheus's past, and section 9 finally calls Zeus to judgement. This juridical disposition is also reflected, on a micro-level, in the third section. The accusation is formulated in the first two lines, while the rest of the section gives arguments in support of the accusation. However, the accusation here is not so much a criminal charge as an attempt at exposing the conceits of traditional worship. The existence of the gods is nowhere expressly denied in the poem, which, in Enlightenment fashion, rather traces the origin of religion in human nature and the ensuing development of institutionalized worship.39 The central word of the first two lines, 'armeres', points back at the last word from the previous section ('beneidest', 1. 12), where Zeus is seen envying Prometheus the warmth of his hearth. It points toward 'nahret kummerlich' in the third line and 'darbtet' in the fifth line, which together with 'Bettler' in the seventh line map out an imagery of poverty and need. The idea of gods feeding on prayers and sacrifice is a satirical motif also explored by Lucian (Iuppiter tragoedus, 18; Prometheus, 19), but in Goethe's poem the gods are further cast as unproductive hangers-on. The socio-economic aspect is further emphasized by the neologism 'Opfersteuern' (1. 16), which conflates devotion with revenue, and the almost feudal reference to the 'Majestat' (1. 17) ofthe gods. This section thus forms one of the cornerstones for Marxist readings of the poem as 'die 39 Pace Georg Brandes, Wolfgang Goethe, 2 vols (Copenhagen and Kristiania: Gyldendal, 1915), 1, 101?02, who reads 'Prometheus' as a herald of Feuerbach's atheism.</page><page sequence="10">JONAS J0LLE 403 entschiedenste und folgenreichste Auflehnung gegen die Feudalgesellschaft'.40 In the Gymnasien of the GDR 'Prometheus' was read together with Gottfried August Biirger's 'Der Bauer an seinen Durchlauchtigsten Tyrannen' (1773),41 a poem of explicit social criticism and pre-industrial revolutionary sentiment.42 There is, however, an inconsistency between this section and the last, where Prometheus says of himself: 'Hier sitz ich forme Menschen' (1. 50). In the third section, 'Opfersteuern und Gebetshauch' (1. 16) already suggests some kind of institutionalized worship. Also, 'Kinder und Bettler' (1. 18) presupposes an established human society with all its differences of age and prosperity. It leaves open the question who made children and beggars to be such gullible fools, before Prometheus made his own generation of more resilient humans.43 The drama knows only ofthe humans that Prometheus moulds with Minerva's help, but in the poem it seems that Prometheus is shaping a second generation of humans that will be able to live without the help of the gods. The anachronism of 'Kinder und Bettler' (1. 18) supports Boccaccio's and later Enlightenment readings of Prometheus as an educator who, rather than rivalling the biblical Genesis, teaches men how to live 'une vie plus humaine' {Encyclopedie, xiii (1765), 446). With the fourth section, the tense of Prometheus's narrative changes from the present to the imperfect. Moving back in time, the fourth section begins with the story of his childhood, while the next sections follow him through youth and early manhood. Only the last section returns again to the present tense by speaking of the humans he is now fashioning. Thus the first three and the last sections frame a longer retrospective passage that describes the human development ofthe god Prometheus. In Goethe's 'Mahomets Gesang' the river image is locked in a similar exchange with the terms of human development. Prometheus's walking through his own childhood thus also adds an important psychological dimension to the myth of Prometheus: Als ich ein Kind war Nicht wuBte wo aus wo ein Kehrt mein verirrtes Aug Zur Sonne als wenn driiber war Ein Ohr zu horen meine Klage Ein Herz wie meins Sich des bedrangten zu erbarmen.

The involuntary memory of himself as a child in a similar state of credulity pushes him to reflect on his own development as a process of emancipation. That process is shared both by Prometheus, as his own personal history from child 'zum Manne' (1. 41), and by humankind at large, as the process of civilization from physical necessity to the domination of nature (cf. Blumenberg, p. 9). Thus in Goethe's poem, human ontogenesis and the phylogenesis of humankind are collapsed into a single narrative?that of Prometheus's way from childhood to manhood.45 Goethe's Prometheus thus also touches on some central eighteenth-century concerns with religion and the nature of the divine. These concerns were de- cisively articulated by David Hume in his Natural History of Religion, where he seeks to re-evaluate mainly Greek and Roman polytheism. Both Herder and Kant had studied Hume's essay, which sets out to explain how a particular belief came about and 'its origin in human nature'. Hume traces all beliefs, and the possible lack thereof, back to certain innate qualities in human nature. Although not an 'original instinct', belief arises as a response to 'the incessant hopes and fears which actuate the human mind', by naming and personifying what is unknown and threatening: Agitated by hopes and fears of this nature, especially the latter, men scrutinize, with a trembling curiosity, the course of future causes, and examine the various and contrary events of human life. And in this disordered scene, with eyes still more disordered and astonished, they see the first obscure traces of divinity.46 Although any textual parallel must be merely coincidental, since there is no evidence that Goethe knew Hume's treatise at that time, it is nevertheless striking to compare the 'eyes [. . .] disordered' with the 'verirrtes Aug' (1. 22) in Goethe's poem. Hume's vision of early belief-formation agrees neatly with Prometheus's attempts as a child at understanding his own situation. Both in Hume and in Goethe, the way of prehistoric man or ofthe child towards divinity is through the senses rather than through the intellect. Yet whereas in Hume this is an ultimately rational way towards the intelligent author of nature, in Goethe's poem that way leads to self-delusion, not so much because there is no intelligent author, but because he, in an Epicurean fashion, is too far removed from human cares and worries to warrant human devotion. As a god the young Prometheus immediately assumes an affinity between his own heart and a hoped-for divine heart: 'Ein Herz wie meins' (1. 25). The reciprocity of feeling with the universe to which the young Prometheus aspires, not unlike Goethe's Ganymede or, indeed, his Mahomet in that respect, is, however, not fulfilled.47 As a result he describes himself as a 'Bedrangter', and in the sixth section he goes on to describe himself with increasing vehemence as 45 Wellbery, The Specular Moment, pp. 300-12, has done much to broaden the context within which this poem can be discussed, especially concerning eighteenth-century religious discourse. The following passage on the evolutionist model and on Hume owes, with some important modi- fications, much to his study. 46 David Hume, The Natural History of Religion, ed. by H. E. Root (Stanford: Stanford Uni? versity Press, 1956), pp. 21, 27, 28. 47 Cf. Mahomet, MA, 1/1, 516,11. 9-10, 'Wer, wer wendetdem Flehensein Ohr?

The nominalized past participles refer to an experience so strong that the narrator comes to identify himself by the emotional terms of his suffering. The last word ofthe section ('erbarmen', 1. 26) seems to disrupt the reworking of the classical myth in the poem by introducing a central concept from the Christian doctrine of salvation. Yet such exchange of terms between Christianity and classical mythology is not uncommon, and from early on the Church Fathers made connections between Prometheus and Christ, Tertullian calling him 'verus Prometheus deus omnipotens' (Adversus Marcum, 1. 1).48 In that last word of the section, but also in the imagery of the heart as the seat of internalized religiosity, this poem reveals also the influence of the Pietistic tradition.49 In Goethe's poem, however, it is Zeus who is addressed as the Christian god by Prometheus, thereby adding to the reworking of the myth a critical edge against Christian religion.50 As he recounts further incidents from his childhood in the fifth section, Prometheus is in a sense telling his own myth, thereby lending it an uncanny human authenticity. The account given in the poem thus becomes part ancient tale and part personal history: Wer half mir wider Der Titanen Ubermut Wer rettete vom Tode mich Von Sklaverei? Hast du's nicht alles selbst vollendet Heilig gliihend Herz? Und gluhtest jung und gut, Betrogen, Rettungsdank Dem Schlafenden dadroben. (11. 27-35) In the struggle between the Titans on the one side and Zeus with the Olympian gods on the other, Prometheus, although arguably the son of a Ti- tan, cleverly aligned himself with Zeus in suppressing the Titans and securing his own independence. Prometheus is perhaps slightly overstating his role in defeating the Titans, but he uses the story again to stress his abandonment as a child. Goethe's poem, more so than his drama, adds to the reworking of the myth a psychological aspect, in explaining his adult behaviour by his childhood experiences. In the drama the relationship between Prometheus and Zeus is explicitly interpreted as the conflict between father and son. Without carrying the father-son relationship over into the poem, where it remains unspoken, Prometheus's soliloquy is nevertheless charged with the same emotional inten- sity. There follows another rhetorical question, addressed to himself, where the answer is implicitly affirmative: 'Hast du's nicht alles selbst vollendet' (1. 31). 48 Cf. Blumenberg, Arbeit am Mythos, p. 600: 'So bleibt [. . .] immer etwas vom Prometheus in der Solidarisierung des Sohnes mit der aus dem Paradies gefallenen Menschheit.' 49 Reinhardt, 'Prometheus', 149; August Langen, Der Wortschatz des deutschen Pietismus (Tii- bingen: Niemeyer, 1954), pp. 171, 372-73, 411. 50 Goethe-Handbuch, 1, 112; Hermann August KorfT, Geist der Goethezeit: Versuch einer ideellen Entwicklung der klassisch-romantischen Literatur geschichte, 5 vols (Leipzig: Weber, 1923-57), 1 (1923), 281-83.</page><page sequence="13">406 Goethe's Prometheus and the Enlightenment His single-handed tackling of the Titans serves as a rite of passage for the young Prometheus who emerges from his mythical ordeals speaking assertively of himself and his own abilities. What he discovers, along with growing dis? illusionment with the gods, is the self-sufficiency of his own heart, which he addresses as the pulsating centre of his individuality. In Goethe's earlier poem 'Kiinstlers Morgenlied' the speaker similarly locates 'hier in meinem Herzen [. . .] | das Allerheiligste' (11. 3-4). Prometheus's glowing heart also points back to the synecdoche in the first two sections. The 'Glut' at the centre of his world has its parallel in the 'gliihend Herz' at the (imaginary) centre of his existence.51 The self-sufficiency of the human heart is also at issue in a remarkable passage from Iphigenie auf Tauris, written only a few years after 'Prometheus': thoas . Es spricht kein Gott; es spricht dein eignes Herz. iphigenie. Sie reden nur durch unser Herz zu uns. (11. 493-94, MA, in/i, 174) The heart, Iphigenie claims, intuits what the gods want us to know. In 'Prometheus', however, the question arises whether the gods are communi- cating or whether the human heart is not sufficient by itself. Where Iphi? genie's heart serves as a medium through which the gods speak to humans, Prometheus's glowing heart stands for human autonomy. Addressing his own heart, Prometheus is discovering and articulating his individuality. Wellbery similarly speaks of 'a moment of hermeneutic anagnorisis' (p. 321) where Prometheus, in working through his childhood, recognizes that he alone has accomplished it all, not only helping himself when he was abandoned by the gods, but also establishing his own earth and populating it with a new genera? tion of humans. This self-interpretation also allows him, in the next section, to question, if not the existence of the gods, then at least their utility and relevance to himself and thus to his humans. The intransitive verb 'gluhen' is here used with both a direct and an indirect object (cf. Langen, p. 411) and entwined with an adverbial structure: 'gluhtest jung und gut, | Betrogen, [adv.] Rettungsdank [d.o.] | Dem Schlafenden [i.o.] dadroben' (11. 33-35). The sinuous syntax of these last three lines, perhaps emulating Pindar,52 is stressed by the harte Fiigung of the asyndeton 'gut, | Betrogen, Rettungsdank' and by the fitting of two objects to an intransitive verb. The climactic effect of these dense lines is further marked by their position between the pivotal lines 'Heilig gluhend Herz' (1. 32) and 'Ich dich ehren? Wofiir?' (1. 36). In 'Wanderers Sturmlied' the same syntactical structure is found with the same verb: 'Gliihte deine Seel Gefahren [i.o.] Pindar | Mut [d.o.] Pindar?' (11. 110-11) and with the intransitive 'stromen', except for the lack of an indirect object: 'Dich dich [d.o.] stromt mein Lied | Jupiter Pluvius' (11. 76-77). The syntactic extension of an intransitive verb by one or even two objects in this way denotes emanation, either of light and warmth or of water, from a single source. In the three instances quoted above the wilful syntax of 51 Cf. Mahomet, MA, i/i, 516, 1. 18, 'Sonn dir gluhendenweiht sich das gliihend Herz.' 52 Cf. Jonas Jolle, 'Goethe's Translation of Pindar's Fifth Olympian Ode', Goethe Yearbook, 10 (2001), 50-64.</page><page sequence="14">JONAS J0LLE 407 the sentences creates a semantic correspondence by enacting the free-flowing, organic form of poetic language. After asserting his own individuality as something apart from the object? ive world of the gods, Prometheus continues the story of his development by moving from his youth, and its rites of passage, to adulthood. The sixth sec? tion opens with a line that seems to justify Nietzsche's reading of the poem as 'seinem Grundgedanken nach der eigentliche Hymnus der Unfrommigkeit':53 Ich dich ehren? Wofur? Hast du die Schmerzen gelindert Je des Beladenen Hast du die Tranen gestillt Je des Geangsteten. Hat nicht mich zum Manne geschmiedet Die allmachtige Zeit Und das ewige Schicksal Meine Herrn und deine. (11. 36-44) Prometheus here also contrasts his own experiences with the gullibility of the 'hofrhungsvolle Toren' in the third section. H. E. Korff, and Georg Brandes before him, read the poem as 'der Kampf des Menschen um seine metaphy- sische Freiheit'. The Prometheus myth with its defiance of the father of the gods offers a parable for eighteenth-century rationalist criticism of Christian religion: 'Dann allerdings fiihlt man, daB hier die Geschichte der Menschheit gleichsam einen Augenblick den Atem anhalt.'54 The history ofthe poem's early reception and its central role in the so-called Spinoza-Streit, involving Moses Mendelsohn, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, and Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, seems to confirm Korff's reading of it as an 'atheistisches Skandalon'.55 Yet his reading is also highly selective: while it brings out the unheard-of force of Prometheus's rebellion, it says little about the poem's many references to Prometheus's suf? fering, which Nietzsche's less optimistic reading stresses, or about the speaker's contradictory position in the poem, which Gaier and Wellbery have recently noted. Already in the next four lines, Prometheus again comes to identify himself with his sufferings through the terms 'Beladener' (1. 38) and 'Geangsteter' (1. 40), echoing the disappointment of the 'bedrangterf (1. 26) in the fourth section. His painful isolation is, however, not only a consequence of an unhappy childhood. Later in life when he comes to understand his situation and decides to mould human beings in express defiance of the gods, he takes the further 53 Friedrich Nietzsche, Geburt der Tragodie, chapter 9, in Nietzsche, Kritische Gesamtausgabe, ed. by Giorgio Colli and Mazzino Montinari (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1967), iii/i, 64. 54 Korff, Geist, p. 282; Walter Friedrich Otto, Der griechische Gottermythos bei Goethe und Holderlin (Berlin: Kiipper, 1939), p. 19. 55 Goethe-Handbuch, 1, 107.

In the Prometheus drama, his brother Epimetheus tries to dissuade him from animating his statues, but seeing that he will not be dissuaded, he, whose Greek name translates as 'hindsight', comes with an almost visionary warning of his brother's impending suffering: bruder. Du stehst allein. Dein Eigensinn verkennt die Wonne Wenn die Gotter, du, Die deinigen und Welt und Himmel all Sich all ein innig ganzes fuhlten. prometheus. Ich kenne das. (Prom., 11. 82-87) Prometheus's answer to Epimetheus can be taken as an admission that, for all he has suffered at the hands of the gods, he too knows that feeling of 'Wonne', but that he nevertheless is willing to renounce it.56 In book 15 of Dichtung und Wahrheit, Goethe similarly describes Prometheus as someone who 'abgesondert von den Gottern' and 'zum Trutz hoherer Wesen, zu schaffen und zu bilden vermag' (MA, xvi, 680, 682). Defiance ofthe gods and fashioning of humankind are two aspects of the same thing, both resulting in the precarious isolation that Epimetheus predicted. Prometheus is, however, not only isolated from the gods: by virtue of being himself a god, the son either of Zeus or of a Titan, he will, as an immortal creator, also be isolated from his mortal creatures.57 Thus he becomes what Goethe, again in book 15 of Dichtung und Wahrheit, calls a 'Mittelfigur', something neither divine nor human (MA, xvi, 682). Paradoxically, he is forced to enact the role both of 'Gegengott', towards Zeus and the gods who stand accused, and of 'Ubermensch' (as Kommerell calls him, p. 437) towards the human beings he moulds in his own image. Prometheus's situation is therefore not only an intermediate one, hovering somewhere between gods and humans, it is an almost impossible one. Although Goethe's Prometheus, both in the poem and in the drama, is never explicitly punished for his all too great love of humans, as in Aeschylus, or for his stealing of fire, as in Hesiod, he repeatedly calls attention to his own suffering. No longer an immortal god who hovers above mortal cares, but a human who suffers on human terms, Prometheus seems to have internalized the traditional punishment on the Caucasian rock. In the poem, his physical punishment, as told in previous accounts of the myth, is reinterpreted as emotional suffering. Conversely, in a diary entry of April 1780, Goethe turns his own suffering into mythological terms by noting laconically: ' Lidte Prometheisch'.s8 Wellbery (p. 322 n. 73) reads 'zum Manne geschmiedef (1. 41) as a further allu? sion to Prometheus's punishment, as cited in Hederich's Lexicon: 'Prometheus aber wurde [. . .] an den Berg Caukasus also angeschmiedef (p. 2093).

This interpreta? tion is already prefigured in Boccaccio's and later Enlightenment readings of the punishing eagle?through physical allegory?as 'des profondes &amp; penibles meditations' and 'le chagrin de mener une vie miserable'.59 In a longer passage from the drama fragment, the allusion to punishment is extended by the image of the bosom as the seat of human emotions: Haben sie [. . .] [...] Diesen Busen gestdhlt Zu trotzen den Titanen! Hat nicht mich zum Manne geschmiedet. (11. 24-28) A later passage in Iphigenie auf Tauris similarly interprets suffering through the story of Promethean punishment: Weh mir! es haben die Ubermacht'gen Der Heldenbrust grausame Qualen Mit ehernen Ketten festgeschmiedet. (11. 1307-9, MA, iii/i, 196) In 'Prometheus' this interpretative exchange between the emotional and the physical thus reflects the precarious balance between inner and outer nature. After invoking the human terms of his suffering, Prometheus seems to pick up the self-confidence he gained in addressing his own heart, as the principle of individuation. The tone of voice changes from self-indulgently juvenile to becoming more masculine: 'zum Manne geschmiedet' (1. 41), 'allmachtige Zeit' (1. 42), and 'meine Herrn und deine' (1. 44). 'Zeit' and 'Schicksal' (11. 42-43) are each given epithets traditionally associated with the other, thus joining the two personifications in an abstract concept of a Being superior even to the gods: that of Destiny. In the drama fragment Prometheus sends Mercury, the gods' messenger, away with the words: 'Ich diene nicht Vasallen' (1. 47). No longer supreme beings themselves, the gods have become vassals of the same master as Prometheus. By claiming the supremacy of Destiny not only over himself, but also over the gods ('Meine Herrn und deine", 1. 44), Prometheus topples the order of the pantheon. The gods are under double attack and now come paradoxically to occupy an intermediate position, between the objective claims of 'Die allmachtige Zeit | Und das ewige Schicksal' (11. 42-43) and the subjective claims of his 'Heilig gluhend Herz' (1. 32). This insight enables Prometheus, like the orator Cyniscus in Lucian's Iuppiter confutatus, further to marginalize the gods, pushing them almost into absurdity. It is not only mockery when he asks at the beginning of the section: 'Ich dich ehren? Wofiir?' (1. 36), but a question to which the gods to their own embarrassment have no answer. The sixth section reveals again, like the second, a significant closeness, 59 Encyclopedie xm (1765), 446; cf. Boccaccio, Genealogie, book 1111, chapter xliv, 'illi praecordia aiunt ab aquila lacerari: idest a meditationibus sublimibus anxiari' ('They say the vitals are lacerated by an eagle: that is, tormented by meditations on the sublime').</page><page sequence="17">41 o Goethe's Prometheus and the Enlightenment whether directly or indirectly, to Lucian's dialogues of the gods. In luppiter confutatus, all the gods are gathered in heaven to hear the oration of Cyniscus (a telling name) on earth, who argues against the existence of the gods. His argument is based on the Homeric wisdom that the Moirai (the Fates) govern everything and that even the gods are subject to their rule. Thus the gods can? not be said to be all-powerful, and in some aspects they are not very different from humans. This allows Cyniscus to entangle the gods in a web of paradoxes and contradictions. Again Lucian plays out the incongruity between older epic representations of the gods and modern philosophical approaches to the nature ofthe divine (luppiter confutatus, 5, 9, 19; luppiter tragoedus, 25). In his clear-sighted reading of the poem, Nietzsche identifies as its two main aspects 'Unfrommigkeit' and 'Gerechtigkeit'. The impiety of Prometheus's actions is often remarked upon and has already been discussed, but the com? plementary move towards reconciliation and a new divine order is often over- looked: Das Wunderbarste an jenem Prometheusgedicht [. . .] ist aber der tiefe aschyleische Zug nach Gerechtigkeit: das unermeBliche Leid des kiihnen 'Einzelnen' auf der einen Seite, und die gottliche Not, ja Ahnung einer Gotterdammerung auf der andern, die zur Versohnung, zum metaphysischen Einssein zwingende Macht jener beiden Lei- denswelten?dies alles erinnert auf das starkste an den Mittelpunkt und Hauptsatz der aschyleischen Weltbetrachtung, die iiber Gotter und Menschen die Moirai als ewige Gerechtigkeit thronend sieht.6? Reversing the tide of influence, Nietzsche here interprets Goethe's poem through Aeschylus's tragedy. Nietzsche's reading tries to see beyond the bloody- minded rebellion against the gods by interpreting the triumph of abstract personification ('Gerechtigkeit') over anthropomorphic gods as the step from prehistorical confusion to a more rational world-order. Thus the victory of 'Zeit' (1. 42) and 'Schicksal' (1. 43) over the Olympian gods represents the latest dialectical turn in the history of the gods that has the Titans overcoming Oura- nos, and the Titans in turn being overthrown by Zeus, aided by Prometheus. Zeus and the Olympian gods are now overturned by abstract concepts defined by a new generation of enlightened worshippers. By repeating the old argument of the Fates governing the gods, the poem implicitly rejects the anthropomorphic assumptions of Christianity and estab? lishes a more abstract concept ofthe divine. Here, if anywhere, the poem reveals its contentious closeness to Spinoza's concept of God in that it similarly rejects any anthropomorphism and comes to understand God as 'ens absolute infini- tum' (Ethica, 1, Definitio vi). The retrospective passage that had begun in the fourth section comes to an end with the penultimate section:61 60 Nietzsche, Geburt der Tragodie, chapter 9, in Gesamtausgabe, iii/i, 64 (emphasis original); Reinhardt,'Prometheus', p. 145. 61 While all editions have 'Knabenmorgen', the earliest manuscript, M, has 'Knabenmargen' (no Umlaui). Jacob Grimm, Deutsches Worterbuch, 16 vols (Leipzig: Hirzel, 1854-1954), v (1873), 1325, thus reads 'Knabenmarchen'. Apart from the textual evidence in MS M (rejected in Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Sdmtliche Werke, ed. by Dieter Borchmeyer and others, 40 vols (Frankfurt a.M.: Deutscher Klassiker Verlag, 1985- ), 1, 928, 'Kommentar'), 'Knabenmorgen'hardly makes</page><page sequence="18">JONAS J0LLE 411 Wahntest etwa Ich sollt das Leben hassen In Wusten fliehn Weil nicht alle Knabenmargen Bliitentraume reiften. (11. 45-49) From the way the opening question is put, it is clear that Prometheus did not flee into the desert, like a St Jerome. The 'Knabenmargen | Blutentraume' (11. 48-49) point back to the early hopes he had for 'Ein Ohr zu horen meine Klage | Ein Herz wie meins' (11. 24-25). If Prometheus's early expectations of a human-like heart and of a sympathetic ear among the gods proved to be illusory, then Zeus is himself guilty of a greater delusion. The initial 'Wahntest' (1. 45) reveals Prometheus's defiant, if not triumphant, optimism that he has, contrary to expectation, survived the ordeals. A parallel passage for this section is found in Goethe's somewhat later hymn 'Harzreise im Winter' which speaks, or per? haps rather sings, of the fate of the outcast as the 'Durstenden | In der Wuste' (11. 49-50). Against Zeus's predictions, Prometheus does not take desperate refuge in the desert, like the recluse in 'Harzreise'.62 In the last two sections, rather, Prometheus emerges from his isolation and is successfully reintroduced into (human) society. As Goethe's Prometheus is given more human attributes, the traditional account of his physical punishment is increasingly reinterpreted as emblematic of human suffering at large. With its rhetorical question implying the negative, the penultimate section anticipates the positive statement of the last section. When the narrative turns from the imperfect to the present tense, Prometheus reveals himself in his new role as fashioner of humans. Dramatically suspended until the last section, but all the time central to the fragment, the forming of humans is finally introduced as perhaps the most important element in this treatment of the myth: Hier sitz ich forme Menschen Nach meinem Bilde Ein Geschlecht das mir gleich sei Zu leiden zu weinen GenieBen und zu freuen sich, Und dein nicht zu achten Wie ich. (11. 50-56) The last section is, with some important modifications, taken over from the second act ofthe drama fragment (11. 240-45): sense, even as a Sturm und Drang neologism. 'Knabenmargen', however, like 'Ammenmarchen' (cf. Grimm, Worterbuch, i (1854), 279) or 'Kindermarchen' (cf. Grimm, Worterbuch, v (1873), 742), suggests early delusions or credulity. This would further make a nice parallel to the next neologism by linking 'Knaben-' with 'Bliiten-' (immaturity) and '-margen' with '-traume' (fantasy or illusion). 62 Cf. Langen, Wortschatz, pp. 171-2; Goethe to J. C. Kestner, July 1773, WA iv/2, 96-98: 'Was das kostet in Wiisten Brunnen zu graben'; Goethe to J. C. Kestner, 7 April [?] 1773, WA iv/2, 72-73: 'Ich wandre in Wiisten da kein Wasser ist'; cf. also 'Mahomets Gesang', MA, 1/1, 519, 11. 5?6, where the river is dammed up 'in oder Wiiste, | Gierger Sand' on its course towards the ocean; Wellbery, The Specular Moment, p. 290 n. 3.</page><page sequence="19">412 Goethe's Prometheus and the Enlightenment prometheus. Sieh nieder Zeus Auf meine Welt sie lebt. Ich habe sie geformt nach meinem Bilde Ein Geschlecht das mir gleich sei. Zu leiden weinen, zu genieBen und zu freuen sich Und dein nicht zu achten, wie ich. (11. 240-45) The change from the perfect to the present tense gives the end of the poem an immediate here-and-now effect. Hederich (p. 2092) describes an ancient intaglio where Prometheus is seen sitting moulding his humans, with a butterfly, symbolizing the human soul, hovering over him. In the first act of the drama, Prometheus is merely fashioning inanimate statues, to which Minerva gives life. In the poem, which stresses Prometheus's single-handed achievements, he seems both to mould his humans and to breathe life into them, not unlike the myth of Pygmalion, with which Goethe's accounts of Prometheus show some significant similarities.63 More importantly, however, both the drama and the poem also echo the creation of man in Genesis: VND Gott sprach/ Lasst vns Menschen machen/ ein Bild/ das vns gleich sey [...] VND Gott schuff den Menschen Jm zum Bilde/ zum Bilde Gottes schuff er Jn. (Gen. 1. 26-27, Bibel 1545)64 The account ofthe Creation echoes so strongly in the last section ofthe poem that the first three lines almost seem cut and pasted from the biblical text: Hier sitz ich forme Menschen [...] Gott schuff den Menschen Nach meinem Bilde Jm zum Bilde [...] Ein Geschlecht das mir gleich sei ein Bild/ das vns gleich sey [...] Avoiding a too strong, and arguably blasphemous, parallel to the biblical Genesis, Goethe's poem importantly has Prometheus shaping humans rather than creating them. We have already seen how German and French eighteenth- century texts on Prometheus studiously avoid using the term for creating in all its lexical forms. As already discussed above, Enlightenment readings of the myth seize upon Boccaccio's Christian interpretation and the allegory of Prometheus teaching Scythians technical skills and social behaviour. This read? ing recurs in all the important eighteenth-century Prometheus texts and most importantly in the 1770 edition of Hederich's Mythologisches Lexicon, which served as Goethe's main reference work for classical mythology. Neither in the drama nor in the poem, therefore, is Prometheus a creator of humans in the biblical sense, even though the first three lines of the last section borrow directly from Genesis. Yet in such a word-by-word citation it becomes even more conspicuous that the central word 'schuff' is quietly dropped, so quietly that it has gone almost unnoticed by most critics. In its stead the more neutral 'forme' (1. 50) slips in, perhaps echoing one of Goethe's 63 Cf. 'Pygmalion: Eine Romanze',ikL4, i/i, 115-17; 'Zum ShakespearsTag', MA, 1/2,414: 'Er wetteifert mit Prometheus, bildet ihm Zug vor Zug seinen Menschen nach [. . .] und dann belebt er sie alle mit dem Hauch seines Geistes.' 64 D.

The apparent contradiction in the third section has already been discussed, where Prometheus speaks of 'Kinder und Bettler' (1. 18) who pin their hopes on the gods. This either goes against his intention to fashion humans who have no regard for the gods ('dein nicht zu achten', 1. 55), or it implies that there already are humans on earth and that he is only moulding a second generation (cf. Weimar, p. 89; Saran, p. 135). In the first case, the poem would already in the third section make its ending fallacious and undo the utopian vision before it is even formulated. In the second case, which seems the more likely of the two, Prometheus is a second creator whose belatedness is already interpreted by Boc? caccio through the formula 'duplex est homo' ('man is twofold'). Prometheus's shaping of humans remains secondary to the original creation, be it biblical or otherwise in Goethe's understanding. In so far as 'duplex est homo', the 'homo ciuilis' ('social being') represents a second generation, separated from that of the 'homo naturalis' ('natural being') by the beneficent influence of Prometheus the educator. The finite verb 'forme' (1. 50) in the first line syntactically determines the rest of the section with the accusative 'Ein Geschlecht' (1. 52) in apposition to the direct object 'Menschen' (1. 50). It is, however, not wholly unambiguous which part ofthe sentence the last subordinate clause ('Wie ich', 1. 56) refers back to. If it refers back to the entire final clause ('Und dein nicht zu achten', 1. 55), it merely repeats and affirms what has already been expressed by the relative clause in the third line. However, if it only refers back to the very last word on the previous line which directly precedes the conjunction, it would read like a reversal of the poem's defiant optimism: 'Und dein nicht zu achten, wie ich dich achte.' Even if the arguments for an affirmative reading of the last line are strong, that reading is in itself ambiguous, as Gaier (p. 159) and Wellbery (p. 328) have recently pointed out. Gaier points to an important contradiction in the poem as a speech-act: 'was hat er [sc. Prometheus] denn die ganze Rede hindurch getan als auf Zeus zu achten' (p. 158). When he triumphantly addresses Zeus, claiming that he is shaping a new generation of humans who will pay no heed to him, just in the same way that he pays no heed to him, he cannot help engaging with him, however unwillingly. This problem underlies the entire poem from the first line. The question that the last two lines leave unanswered is why he should go to such lengths protesting against the gods when he is convinced of their irrelevance to humans. There is, to put it differently, a discrepancy here between what Prometheus says and the context in which he is saying it. This pragmatic contradiction in the poem thus also heightens the sense of ambiguity in the last line. Where at the end of the poem Goethe's account of the myth 65 Lauremberg, Acerra philologica, p. 416; cf. Dichtung und Wahrheit. book 1, MA, xvi, 37; Saran, Goethes Mahomet, p. 84.</page><page sequence="21">414 Goethe's Prometheus and the Enlightenment seems to be at variance with itself, there emerges an unresolved tension in Prometheus's Enlightenment project. The present reading of 'Prometheus' set out to examine the new work to which the myth is put in Goethe's poem. While previous readings of 'Prome? theus' reluctantly acknowledge that the meaning ofthe poem cannot be distilled entirely from 'seiner mythologischen Maske',66 this reading has attempted to show that the poem only generates meaning through the retelling of the myth. Goethe's 'Prometheus' does not stand in a modern opposition to the classical accounts of Aeschylus or Hesiod, it rather stands at the end of a long, and largely unbroken, cumulative tradition of elaborating on and interpreting the Prometheus myth. What is important is then to see not so much where the elements ofthe story come from, but to what new uses they are put in this poem. To an extent again ignored by most critics, except recently by Wellbery, Goethe's account of the Prometheus story in the poem and the drama also stands firmly in the interpretative tradition of the Enlightenment. As 'prince poli &amp; savant' he builds huts, tends to the fire in the hearth, distributes property, patiently explains the conditions of life, and argues, like a rationalist critic of religion, articulately against the Olympian gods. The long retrospective passage on Prometheus's development from childhood to a grown man was seen above not only to add to the presentation of the god an important psychological di? mension, explaining his actions with childhood memories, but also to allow the poem to trace the history of religion back to its earliest stages. This is empha? sized by the concurrence of childhood development and prehistory. The way in which the child Prometheus uses his senses rather than his intellect to grasp the nature of the divine, also has a close parallel in Hume's history of religion. Prometheus further, in an almost Spinozist fashion, comes to denounce an- thropomorphic gods as the product of human credulity and superstition. With the insistent address to his own heart, Prometheus finally articulates a claim for human self-reliance that was prepared in the cultural achievements of the opening and finds its ultimate expression in the fashioning of a new generation of humans in the last section. Boccaccio's Christian reading of Prometheus as a second creator already prefigures the near-literal closeness to Genesis in the last section. The story of Prometheus in Goethe's poem combines various traditional ele? ments and suppresses others, but the way in which these elements are under? stood and pieced together is significant. While the formal use of classical mytho? logy as a heuristic tool in Goethe's hymns shows the influence of Herder and the distance from earlier Enlightenment criticism of mythology, the individual elements of the Prometheus story are largely understood in the interpretative tradition of the Enlightenment. Or to put it differently, while the myth is not presented as a Rococo fable of human reason, but forcefully retold in an ex? pressive 'anti-hymn', Prometheus's actions and words still bear witness to the project of the Enlightenment. Prometheus may therefore have a just claim to be the central myth of the late eighteenth century, not only because Goethe's 66 Meller,'Wositzt der Gott?',p. 195; Gaier,'Vom Mythos',p. 151:'einpoetischesSimulacrum'; Korff, Geist, p. 294: 'alte mythologische Hulsen'.</page><page sequence="22">JONAS J0LLE 415 paramount account was written in that century, but because that account, al? most belatedly, focuses much of the tradition that made him the symbolic figure of the Enlightenment.
