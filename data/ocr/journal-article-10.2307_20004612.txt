<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rel. Stud. I, pp. i o-i i 8. E. G. PARRINDER Reader in Comparative Study of Religions, University of London RECENT VIEWS OF INDIAN RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY The appearance of several important books on Indian religion and philosophy provides an opportunity for consideration of the attractions and obstacles to understanding that important world of thought. At the end of the British Raj it seemed as if there might be a slackening of interest in India, but no thing will stop Indians writing and many books are still coming from Euro pean and American writers. But how reliable are they? 'Indian philosophy is much bound up with theology', remarks Ninian Smart, and 'suspicions of Indian philosophy are not mitigated by the current Western enthusiasm for Oriental spirituality: travelling monks and yogis (though often innocent of pompous intentions) tend to speak of their "philosophy" rather than of religion, partly because the latter term is loaded in a special way in its Western use. Thus they give the impression that spiritual uplift, rather than analytic exactness, is the chief characteristic of Indian philosophy.' On the other hand, 'there is the prevalent suspicion, among English-speaking philo sophers, that the theological bent of much Indian metaphysics means that Indian argumentation is neither rigorous nor realistic'. And in any case it may be held that 'philosophy is either an international activity where na tional roots are irrelevant or it is mere history of ideas', and so the complex Indian schools are only of incidental interest. To these handicaps must be added the barrier of language. The English reader is likely to be told by the philologist that he cannot understand Hin duism without a thorough knowledge of Sanskrit, or Buddhism without at least Pali and Chinese, if not Japanese and Tibetan. Taken to its full extent this would close the East almost completely to the West; for life is too short to allow most people to keep abreast of philosophy or theology, with some backing of Western classical languages, and attain a competence in half a dozen oriental tongues. It is for the linguists to translate the great eastern classics, though often they seem to have too little interest in religious subjects to produce the translations. The great Pali Text Society translations are models of what might be done much more widely. Further objections are made that translations lose the flavour of the original. But how many of us, in fact, read Plato in Greek, Kant in German, or even Descartes in French?</page><page sequence="2">110 E. G. PARRINDER Yet the 'mysterious East' is both fascinating and daunting, and to keep us further off Indians may say that its thought is so 'spiritual' that it is beyond the capacity of the 'material-minded' European. He is also criticised, in a curious contradiction, for relying on the 'head' rather than the 'heart'. No doubt there are plenty of subtle thoughts and obscure texts, but Professor J. N. Findlay remarked recently that much Buddhist philosophy at least was fairly simple to translate. Yet the technical terms, dtman, Tsvara, Samilkhya, and the rest, with which books on Indian philosophy are usually littered, are rather off-putting; they 'keep breaking into Sanskrit'. Professor Smart, in Doctrine and Argument in Indian Philosophy, has made a bold attempt at writing an exposition of the principal schools in Indian philosophy, including Buddhism and Jainism, without using any Sanskrit or Pali words in the text. To his professional competence in philosophy he brings his knowledge of Sanskrit and Pali to open the Indian field to a wider public. There will be criticism of the way in which this has been done, or whether it can be done at all, though to forbid it would be a counsel of defeat. But there is justification for the view that if Indian philosophy is important it should be available to a wider public than that, perhaps decreasing, small circle that knows the languages well. It may be argued that concepts cannot be divorced from the language of their expression, and so translations are inadequate or useless, but against this it is claimed that there are plenty of expositions using Sanskrit, the commentaries are innumerable. Further, the key expressions are not lifted over into English without qualification. What Ninian Smart has done is to mark key Sanskrit and Pali terms in his English text with an asterisk, and then the glossary gives fuller explanation and some indication of various uses. Thus '*self' stands for dtman. The asterisk distinguishes it from the English word 'self' with its more restricted meaning, and the Glossary explains that '*self' can be used reflexively, or of the 'spirit', the 'eternal self', and also of the 'World-Spirit'. But the word 'self' has ambiguities in English as well as in Sanskrit, and may mean 'ego' more than 'spirit', especially with modern psychological under tones. So some translators have preferred to render dtman as 'soul' or 'spirit', as more theological and yet sufficiently elastic to allow a variety of usage. R. C. Zaehner in his Hindu and Muslim Mysticism notes that atman can mean 'immortal soul', 'ego', 'animal soul' or 'lower self' and also the reflexive pronoun. A tough verse of the Bhagavad GTtJ, 6, 5, is a test case for translators. Edgerton, the most literal, gives it straight: One should lift up the self by the self, And should not let the self down; For the self is the self's only friend, And the self is the self's only enemy. Zaehner remarks that this is meaningless, and he attempts distinctions, in the</page><page sequence="3">RECENT VIEWS OF INDIAN RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY III light of parallel Muslim terminology, and so arrives at a more comprehen sible version: A man should uplift himself by his spirit: he should not degrade himself. Spirit is man's friend, the animal soul his enemy. Smart translates '*soul' for the Purusha, the eternal element in living beings, which literally means 'person' or 'man', and which is also used of the world soul and at times virtually identified with dtman. Edgerton and others prefer to translate purusha as 'spirit', reserving 'soul' and 'self' both for dtman. This is where literal translation and use of the same word in all contexts become impossible, and the headaches of interpreters of Indian texts are many. Ninian Smart has attempted a great and important task. Like the Indian classics, his book is not easy reading. The asterisks, carefully inserted on every occurrence of the root words, do not help the appearance of the pages. The first chapter plunges straightaway into an exposition of the six major schools of Hindu philosophy. The use of their names, with those of leading gods and men, cannot be avoided, but it might have helped the English reader to Anglicise more boldly and, for example, write Vishnu or Upanishads without diacritical dots, at least where such usage has been established in English for many years. The first part of the book studies the major Indian systems in ten chapters, and the second part, with some useful overlapping, considers arguments about the existence of God, the soul, rebirth, and questions of epistemology, causation, induction and inference. Almost at the same time appeared Franklin Edgerton's Beginnings of Indian Philosophy. This is truly, as the blurb claims, the result of a lifetime of study of Sanskrit language and Hindu teaching. The great Heinrich Zimmer once said that Indian scriptures were so extensive that nobody could read them all. Where then does one begin, and is there any possibility of a one volume anthology for non-specialists? Several attempts have been made at this and Edgerton's is the best so far, even if the choice is not everybody's. This is, in fact, a selection from Vedas, Upanishads and Gita. Some of the texts have appeared before but the thirty-page introduction is new, clear and informa tive, and the product of long and confident scholarship. It gives useful re ferences to some of Edgerton's articles that are tucked away in a variety Ot journals. More of a historical sketch than Smart's, Edgerton's Introduction guides gently through the ritualism of the Rig Veda and the popular religion of the Atharva Veda, and then plunges into the philosophical speculations of the Upanishads. Admittedly they are difficult: 'the dry bones of the Vedic ritual cult frequently rattle about in them in quite a noisy fashion, and seriously strain our patience and our charity. But in them the struggling speculations . . . reach a higher development'. That knowledge was the primary way for true living and final salvation</page><page sequence="4">II2 E. G. PARRINDER was taken for granted by the Upanishadic and many later Hindu writers, and it is prominent even in that medley of mythology and philosophy, the great epic Mahdbharata. The way of knowledge is dubbed Samkhya, which often sought renunciation of action. Edgerton calls Samkhya 'reason method' or the 'way of knowledge'. He criticises the common designation of Samkhya as 'enumeration', 'numerical system' (Smart calls it Distinction ism), because all Hindu systems revelled in numerical categories, and the later Yoga, which criticised Samkhya, took over all its categories and added to them. Samkhya, Edgerton insists, was not a metaphysical system at all, but a way of salvation by knowledge. Certainly in the Bhagavad Gitd, 2, 39 and 3, 3 Samkhya is parallel or complementary tc Yoga, the one is knowing, the latter doing. Both lead to salvation (5, 5) but the goal is hard to attain without Yoga. The Gita is insistent on action and its formal theme is that the warrior Arjuna must fight; it is his caste duty, nature will compel him, and anyway God is doing it in him, or has already done it, Arjuna is but the agent. Nobody can cease from action, not even the most extreme ascetic, and God himself is ever acting, for if he were to cease from work all the worlds would fall in ruin. Constant reference to the divinity is characteristic of the classical Upani shads, and the Epic abounds in that anthropomorphic polytheism and re fined abstraction which are such puzzles to the European student. This is well brought out in Alain Danielou's recently translated Hindu Polytheism. If it were nothing else the English version is a fine example of the superiority of British publishing over French, for it is beautifully produced and illustrated, with fine print and paper and solid binding. The English editions of Mircea Eliade's Yoga and Shamanism, also from Routledge and Kegan Paul, are similar examples of publishing that allows a certain insular pride. Danielou justifies the lushness of Hindu polytheism by instancing the many attempts it represents at explaining the riddles of the universe by cosmological theories. The deities stand for universal principles and are changed when necessary to make these principles more easily apprehended. European stu dies of Hinduism seek to distinguish original systems which became confused in the mass of Hindu thought, but Indian studies have sought to present an all-inclusive picture which tried to express the complex nature of the uni verse. Different gods, modes of worship, and paths of realisation are recog nised, rather than proselytising through mutually exclusive creeds. Indeed it is suggested that the multiplicity of gods in a polytheistic system is no more confusing or primitive than monotheism 'which is always linked with a cul ture, a civilisation. . . . We can see all monotheistic religions fighting to impose their god and destroy other gods, as if God were not one as they claim.' For the Gatd says that those who worship other gods, if they worship truly with faith, worship the one divinity even though ignorant of the proper worship.</page><page sequence="5">RECENT VIEWS OF INDIAN RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY II3 Danielou is better on mythology than philosophy or history. He sees three main Hindu philosophical outlooks: the experimental or logical, the meta physical view of Vedas and Upanishads, and the cosmological which he identifies with Samkhya and methods of supramental perception linked with Yoga 'which studies the "enduring" or permanent laws of things'. It is claimed that there is no real change in religion from Vedic to modern times or deviation from Vedic ideas of divinity, but few historians of Indian reli gion would agree with this, at any rate in the West. The discovery of the Indus valley cultures has thrown an entirely new light on the relationship between the celestial and warrior gods of the Vedic Aryan texts and the indigenous gods which disappeared from view for a time but powerfully re emerged and became the great gods of today. Along with them emerged also yogic practice, belief in transmigration, and different ideas of the universe than appear in the Rig Veda. Most of Danielou's work is a discussion of the gods in turn, backed up by Sanskrit texts in the original and translation, and given his spiritualising tendencies this is well done. Some gods come in for short measure and, for example, to find out much about the popular god Hanuman one still has to turn to Dowson's classical dictionary of Hindu mythology. The persistence of this most extensive of mythologies is confusing to those who try to disentangle the principal themes of Indian thought, which are complicated enough in philosophy let alone in religion. But, as Ninian Smart reminds us, the philosophy and religion are intertwined. Yet orthodoxy consists not in belief in one god or another, or even in a single God, but rather in assent to the validity of the classical scriptures in which religious beliefs and philosophical theories blend. The 'orthodox' (dstika) asserts that 'it is' (asti), meaning first that the Vedic scriptural revelation is true, and then bearing the secondary meaning of 'God is'. The 'unorthodox' (ndstika) is secondarily 'atheistic', but primarily declares 'it is not' (na asti), meaning that the scriptural revelation is untrue. The Buddhists and Jains are in this latter category, but there are orthodox Hindu schools which deny the exis tence of a creator God. Fundamental to an understanding of almost any aspect of Hindu thought is the Bhagavad Gita. It is a deliberate eirenicon, a compromise between the speculations of philosophers, the rites of priests, the caste duties of rulers and soldiers, and the emotionalism and idolatry of popular religion. It openly recognises the possibility of salvation by different paths: knowledge, works, or devotion, and so it sets the tone for that tolerance of other ways within the eternal religion that characterised later Hinduism. Yet, because of its com plexity, and the handicap of translating a famous poem into the prose of other languages, the Gatd is often difficult to follow even when it is not obscure in itself. Here Edgerton is generally a valuable and reliable guide. The selections printed in his latest book contain the major part of his own literal E</page><page sequence="6">II4 E. G. PARRINDER line by line translation of the Gitd, which many people think is the best of the numerous English versions. He abridges it in places, but little of importance is omitted. The tedious names of the first chapter are dropped, and he begins with chapter two and the statement of Arjuna's problem. Krishna's replies are given, with explanatory headings. In the great theophany of chapter eleven Edgerton reverts to Sir Edwin Arnold's verse rendering from The Song Celestial of I885, for which he has always professed admiration, though it is a paraphrase; but perhaps this is what the transfiguration scene needs, or at any rate only poetry is capable of sketching its indescribable glories and ter rors. Here the GUtJ thrusts home its message that all gods are manifestations of the One Unmanifested; Krishna himself is Brahman, manifest yet beyond manifestation. Edgerton follows the common opinion that the Gitd reveals Krishna as the avatar of Vishnu and praises the dualistic, or qualified non-dualistic, view above the fully monistic teaching in elevation of devotion above knowledge and works. But a serious attack on this opinion, and on much interpretation of Indian mysticism, has recently been made in an unpublished thesis on Bhakti devotion by Dr Krishna Sharma. On this theory the Vaishnavites have tried to appropriate the GCtd as a tract of their own, comprehensible only as a highly personalist justification of the Way of Devotion, with Krishna as avatar of Vishnu for its chief object, and setting the pattern for all Indian Bhakti devotionalism which is fully personalist and virtually dualistic. In fact, Sharma maintains, the Bhagavad Gitd continues the non-dualist (advaita) teaching of the Upanishads, and its devotion is just as possible within a monistic as in a dualistic setting. Krishna is not particularly an avatar of Vishnu, and the GCtd and the Way of Devotion have been followed by non Vaishnavite schools, notably some of the 8aivites. Indian mysticism is not all dualistic or erotic, and famous founders of religious movements, such as Kabir, and Nanak the Sikh leader, who have been regarded as holding even more personal ideas of God due to Muslim influence, held in fact that the divine was beyond all names, like the 'not this, not this' of the Upanishads, and they praised the Brahman 'without qualities'. The personalist interpre tations of the GCtd and much Indian mysticism are said to come from Chris tian writers, such as Albrecht Weber and Monier-Williams in the last cen tury, who consciously or unconsciously tried to fit Indian mysticism into the pattern of Christian monotheistic, personalistic and dualistic conceptions. They influenced all European and Indian writers after them. There is some truth in this argument, even if it is liable to be pushed too far. Monism has been almost as unpalatable to many Western writers as polytheism, and their relief at finding something apparently approximating to monotheism is evident in the stress still often placed on what can be par alleled in our own tradition and underplaying other elements. Whether, and how far, the GCtd teaches non-dualism are different questions; for in its eireni</page><page sequence="7">RECENT VIEWS OF INDIAN RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY I 15 cal efforts it might be said to speak with so many voices that almost any opinion can be justified from its pages; as the Dodo said to Alice, 'every body has won, and all must have prizes'. It is true that the Gitd does not use the word avatdra. Yet the idea is there: 'I send myself forth', and 'I come into being age after age' (4, 7-8). But even here there is no mention of Vishnu, and his other avatars are not mentioned till later on in the Mahabharata. Krishna in the Gatd is rather the manifestation of the supreme Brahman, to know him is to attain to the state of Brahman, called Brahman-nirvana, perhaps with the aim of being more positive than the Buddhists. In the divine identifications of chapter ten Krishna is called Supreme Brahman, supreme dwelling, supreme purifier, eternal divine Spirit (Purusha), unborn Lord and Primal Deity (ddi-deva). He is both manifested and beyond mani festation, in an attempt at combining the Absolute with the creating and revealed. It is hardly possible to go farther than this. The only mention of Vishnu here is among the sun spirits; but 8ankara or 8iva is there also, and the great Vedic god Indra is even more prominent with his steeds and weapons. However, the transfiguration in chapter eleven gives greater im portance to Vishnu, by his own name and title Hari, and with his emblems of mace and disc. All the gods are within his body, the creator god Brahma emerging from him on a lotus throne, and Vishnu's great mouths engulfing all beings in a cosmic dissolution. It may be that this chapter is a later addi tion or improvement, most of it is in longer metre, and it could be argued that its theology is different. More difficult is the claim that devotion does not necessarily imply any dualism or qualified non-dualism, that it is just as possible and even more natural in the GCtd to follow the traditional monism. 'I am in all and all in me', says Krishna; he is the sacrifice and the sacrificer, he is the author of the Guta and the very man to whom he is speaking, Arjuna. The universal soul is not only within all beings, it is all beings. But if there is no I and Thou, how can there be any relationship of devotion? Dr Sharma replies that the Soul is the object of Bhakti; it is one's true self, though veiled by the illusion of this world. Knowledge supremely reveals this unity and identity, and the Gata often stresses the importance of true knowledge. But that devotion also is needed was shown by the teaching of the great philosopher champion of non-dualism, 8ankara, who commented on the Gatd and wrote hymns to Krishna. No doubt this argument will provide material for much debate in India as well as the West. Whether Sharma's main conclusions will stand up or not, at least she provides correctives to a too Western interpretation of the Gatd and other mystical writings, especially those of Kabir. A useful translation and introduction to another great Indian mystic is F. R. Allchin's recent Kavitdvala, from the Hindi verse of Tulsi Das. From a different direction, but particularly important, comes Raymond Panikkar's new book The Unknown Christ of Hinduism. Fr Panikkar is an Indian Roman</page><page sequence="8">i i6 E. G. PARRINDER Catholic priest, but son of a Hindu father and thoroughly versed not only in scholastic philosophy but in the sacred texts of Hinduism. His book is largely a search for a proper meeting-place between Christianity and Hinduism, indicating the insufficiency of mere doctrinal parallelism and the inadequacy of simple cultural synthesis, and seeking an 'existential encounter' of religions and of men in society: 'this encounter can really and truly take place because it is an encounter in Christ already present in the heart of the two bona fide partners.' Christ is already in Hinduism, says Panikkar, but not yet fully re vealed and recognised; for Christ is in any religion or worship that is true religion and real prayer. So Hinduism is not 'another' religion, but a valuable stage of the eternal truth (sandtana dharma) which finds its fullness in Christia nity. Panikkar's attempts at reconciling Christianity and Hinduism will doubtless be attacked from several sides. The Barthian and Kraemerian school will write it off as a blasphemous attempt, typical of Rome, to bring together two utterly different creeds which have no 'point of contact'. Hindus may feel that it is not enough to regard their 'eternal religion' as only a 'vestibule' for Christianity. And there will be further disagreement on the explanations of religious texts. But it is significant that the attempt can be made, and it bears an imprimatur. Dr Panikkar does not stop at an outline of revised missionary strategy, but he is just as interesting in his treatment of a text of Hindu philosophy, as a sample of what he thinks needs to be done on a much wider scale. The text chosen is the first verse of the classical Brahma Sttra, one of the most cele brated summaries of Indian wisdom in the laconic aphorism, 'whence the origin of this?' This phrase is agreed by commentators to mean, 'Brahman is that whence the origin, sustentation and transformation of this world comes'. Differences of opinion arise when the definition of Brahman is sought, and behind that is the meaning of the soul or self, which was the primary preoccupation of Vedantic philosophy. Panikkar proceeds to a dis cussion of the interpretation of this text by 8ankara who held Brahman to be the cause of the world, though to defend the absoluteness of Brahman 8ankara's followers said that it was not properly Brahman but the Lord (Isvara) who was the cause. But, despite the stress on knowledge, Sankara and many Indian philosophers held that the divine cause cannot be inferred by knowledge alone, but by following the revealed scripture and by the intui tion of non-dualism. Panikkar then considers what can be taken out of this and similar texts. 'Desire to know Brahman' is there, it is a gift or grace, not the actual knowledge but a recognition of some communication. The pre sence of a desire to know Brahman shows a knowledge that the world is not Brahman or its own cause, it is originated, has a source and sustentation. This he links with the Cosmological Argument. Next, Indian philosophy shows a struggle between the ideas of the Absolute and God. The exuberant polytheism of the Vedas gave way to the absolute Brahman of the early</page><page sequence="9">RECENT VIEWS OF INDIAN RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY II7 Upanishads, but these in turn suffered a counter offensive in the later Upani shads for a God anterior to and different from Brahman. This problem, and the relationships of Brahman and Atman, are much discussed today, and warning is given against hurried identification of Brahman and God, and Brahman and the soul. The Hindu and Christian conceptions of God may have similarities but also oppositions, and doctrines of the Trinity and the Person of Christ may seem to remove them from one another even further. Dr Panikkar then develops the concept of the Lord, referring especially to the Bhagavad Gita and the devotional schools in which the Lord acquired pre eminence. Here the Lord is not just a cosmic aspect of the godhead, like many of the Vedic gods, but its personal dimension. The Lord is the personal God essential to devotion, but he also seems to absorb all the godhead, since Brah man is mentioned much less. True, the title Lord (lsvara) is not the most popular name, since worship prefers to adore Krishna, Rama, Hari, 8iva, and so on. But in the reflective stage the teachers of devotion realised that it is the Lord whom all worship, and the mystic Tulsi Das identified the Lord with Brahman both 'with qualities' and 'without qualities'. Dr Panikkar turns again to the Brahma Suitra text and suggests a Christian interpretation of it. 'That from which all things proceed ... is God ... not a kind of inaccessible Brahman, not God the Father and source of the whole divinity, but the true Isvara, God the Son, the Logos, the Christ.' The Vedantic intuition of Brahman as transcendent, yet because of the world in the Lord, 'comes from an authentic theological instinct', and 'we may be allowed to draw on Scripture, even if we do not fully concur with tradition'. Admittedly the Christian view of Christ cannot be totally equated with the Lord of Hinduism, and the historical element in the Gospels needs special emphasis. Yet 'most philosophical misunderstandings about Christ' in India would disappear if Christian theologians would try to speak of Christ in ways that make sense to the Hindu partner in the dialogue. It is concluded that many Hindu philosophical and theological texts contain a fuller sense, and they may legitimately be developed and adapted into Christian use. This is the Unknown Christ of Hinduism, ignored still not only by Hindus but by Christians most of whom in India reject their national religious herit age. And this approach could be extended to the relationships between Chris tianity and other religions. 'The amr of the Koran, the Logos of Plotinus and the Tathagata of Buddhism, for example, spring from a similar view as to the necessity for an ontological link between those two apparently irreconcilable poles: the absolute and the relative ... the selfsame problem that is involved in at least one aspect of the Christian Trinity.' The doctrine of the Trinity thus appears as the unsought answer to the question of a mediator between the one and the many, the absolute and the relative. Like Dr Sharma, Fr Panikkar seems to feel that there is need for fuller appreciation of non-dualism (advaita), even in the realm of devotion. He</page><page sequence="10">ii8 E. G. PARRINDER does not develop this very much, save in a comment on the non-dualist gankara and the 'modified non-dualist' Ramanuja. The Lord of Sankara is God, but not the Absolute, he says; essentially 'with qualities', and yet he 'somehow pretends' also that he is 'without qualities'. To save the absolute Brahman the diversity from the Lord is overstressed. With Ramanuja, on the other hand, the Lord is Brahman, and the creation of the Lord is the body of the Absolute; there is no break in continuity between him and the world, and the identity is overstressed now so that the Lord may save the reality of the souls. In like manner Christ is really God, though not simply 'God' but 'equal to God'. And that non-duality can be used of devotion is suggested in the words of Augustine describing the final state of the world: 'there will only be one Christ living himself'. Whether or not this is a satisfactory way of solving the problem of devotion within non-dualism, it seems that European scholars need to give fuller and more appreciative study to the meaning of non-dualism and its subtle variations. It is urgent for Hinduism and Christianity to understand each other more fully, and this understanding must be attempted at all levels, philosophical and religious. This is a gigantic task, yet Hindu religion and devotion are living and more akin to Christianity than were many of the cults of the an cient world. Hindu philosophy is more congruent with Christianity, says Panikkar, than was Aristotelian philosophy which yet was integrated into Christian thought. The discovery and appropriation of gankara and Rama nuja, and many other Indian thinkers, are just as important to western theology and philosophy today as was the adoption of Plato and Aristotle in the Middle Ages.</page></plain_text>
