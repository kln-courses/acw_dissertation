<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rethinking Darwin in Light of a Culture of Communion Miguel Oliveira Panão* Abstract: Culture influenced Charles Darwin's vision of the world and indirectly produced dramatic changes in the scientific discipline of Biology. On the other hand, with the development of Biology due to Darwin's contríbution, culture changed and its religious dimension is particularly challenged. Here, drawing on the perspective of a culture of communion in the theological and philosophical thinking of Chiara Lubich, I suggest we may be led to rethink Darwin's metaphorical discourse. The implications of such culture for understanding the relation between evolution and Gods providential action, as well as the meaning of pain, suffering and death in light of such understanding are also explored. Keywords: Communion, Culture , Darwin , Evolution, Jesus Forsaken, Lubich Resumo: A cultura influenciou a visão que Charles Darwin tinha do mundo e, indirecta- mente, produziu mudanças dramáticas na disciplina científica da Biologia. Por outro lado, com o desenvolvimento da Biologia devido ao contributo de Darwin, a cultura mudou, bem como desafiada a sua dimensão religiosa. Neste artigo, com base na perspectiva de uma cultura de comunhão de acordo com o pensamento teológico e filosófico de Chiara Lubich, é sugerido que podemos ser levados a repensar o discurso metafórico de Darwin. À luz desta cultura são também exploradas as devidas impli- cações para compreender a relação entre evolução e a acção providencial de Deus, assim como para comrpeender o significado da dor, sofrimento e morte.

Introduction The is existing that paradigm "discoveries knowledge", of all progress are a statement made in science, by enlightened pursuing according possibilities by his to metaphor Michael suggested of Polanyi,1 science by is that "discoveries are made by pursuing possibilities suggested by existing knowledge", a statement enlightened by his metaphor of science as the result of a jigsaw puzzle built by scientists throughout time. Namely "the effectiveness of a group of helpers [scientists] will then exceed that of any isolated member, to the extent to which some member of the group will always discover a new chance for adding a piece to the puzzle more quickly than any one isolated person could have done by himself'.2 This is why the piece of the puzzle of Charles Darwin (1809-1882) - his theory of evolution by Natural Selection - cannot be isolated from the scientific and cultural environment of his time. In fact, Darwins theory is influenced by some of the existing theories, such as those developed by Robert Malthus (1766- 1834) on the difference between the geometrical progression of population increase and the arithmetical progression of food supply in order to explain the important role of Natural Selection in the evolutionary progression, and Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) about the survival of the fittest ,3 a term which Darwin found equivalent to that of natural selection . It can be argued that Darwins way of conceiving a theory of evolution by natural selection is a product of cultural evolution.4 In fact, following Francisco Ayala, "the advent of culture has brought with it cultural evolution, a superorganic mode of evolution superimposed on the organic mode, and which has in the last few millennia become the dominant mode of human evolution".5 And he continues saying that "cultural evolution has come about because of cultural change and inheritance, a distinctively human mode of achieving adaptations to the environment and transmitting the adaptation 1 Polanyi, Michael - The Tacit Dimension. Doubleday Anchor Book, 1967, p. 67. 2 Polanyi, Michael - Knowing and Being - Essays by Michael Polanyi, ed. Maijorie Grene. The University of Chicago Press, 1969, p. 51. Or, from the Origin of the Species : "Looking to the first dawn of life, when all organic beings, as we may believe, presented the simplest structure, how, it has been asked, could the first steps in the advancement or differentiation of parts have arisen? Mr. Herbert Spencer would probably answer that..." (Darwin, Charles - The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life. New York: The Modern Library, 1998, p. 164; parag. before "Convergence of Character" section in chap. IV. Besides the page, endnote references also contain the paragraph in the chapter to enable the reader the identification of Darwin's quotation independently of the Origins Edition). It should be noted that the timescale of cultural evolution is significantly smaller than biological evolution, therefore, even with physical evolution occurring in the last few millennia, cultural evolution became undeniably more important. Ayala, Francisco - "Biology precedes, culture transcends: an evolutionist's view of human nature". Zygon, 33 (1998), pp. 507-523.

Therefore, in the following section, Darwins metaphors are analyzed in order to assess their limitations. 2. Darwin's metaphors Metaphor is an aspect of learning, thus, a way of building a cultural inheritance. Also, metaphors in science are a communicative tool employed to make sense of the world. In Darwin's own words relatively to the term Natural Selection:8 "everyone knows what is meant and is implied by such metaphorical expressions; and they are almost necessary for brevity". A metaphor may inform our thinking without us being aware of it.9 Therefore, not only the culture of ones time may influence what metaphors could be chosen to express scientific ideas, but also may influence one s culture from the moment those metaphors are used in their particular context.10 Darwin relied on other pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of science to develop his theory of evolution by natural selection. In Adam Smiths economic notion of competition he found that "not until we reach the extreme confines of life [...] will competition cease. The land may be extremely cold or dry, yet there will be competition between some few species, or between the individuals of the same species".11 In Malthus notion on the population increase he found that "all that we can do is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being is striving to increase in a geometrical ratio". Therefore, Darwin expresses a certain cultural vision of the natural world by stating that 'when we reflect on this struggle [for existence], we may console ourselves with the full belief that the war of nature is not incessant'. 6 Ibid., p. 513. 7 Ibid. 8 Darwin, Charles - The Origin of Species, p. 09 (end of 2nd paragraph in Ch. IV). 9 Pramling, Niklas - "The role of metaphor in Darwin and the implications for teaching evolution". Science Education, 93 (2009), pp. 535-547. 10 In Beer, Gillian -Darwin s Plots. Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 89: "If we read metaphor [...] as a fundamental means of initiating discovery, we shall better understand its value as a part of theory for Darwin. If, at the same time, we recognise how much metaphoric activity takes place at a level beneath attention, we shall be better able to specify the cultural presumptions which shape Darwin's creativity, and the responses of his contemporaries - and we shall be enabled to examine the ways in which our own presumptions are conditioned by his." 1 Darwin, Charles - The Origin of Species, p. 106 (third paragraph before ending Ch. III). Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66 - Fase. 3 • 2010</page><page sequence="4">622 Miguel Oliveira Panâo For Darwin, nature is at war and selects only the fittest individuals, which struggling for existence, enable the species to survive by gradual and better adaptation to the surrounding environment. But does struggle for existence fully expresses, in its ontology, the notion that we can only be if our being struggles by competing with others? The idea introduced by Konstantin Merezhkovsky (1855-1921) of symbio- genesis, referring to the formation of new organs and organisms through the symbiotic merging, is argued by scientists, such as Lynn Margulis, as the source of evolutionary novelty.12 In this case, cooperation triggered by symbiotic behavior is underlying the evolutionary novelty and not competition at the individual level.13 Moreover, symbiogenesis helps explain observations in alternative theories for the evolutionary mechanisms, relatively to Darwin s gradualism, such as that of Eldredge and Goulds punctuated equilibrium. In Russia, the distrust on western capitalism led naturalists away from a view of evolution emphasizing competition between species, embracing instead a theory of mutual aid, as developed by Peter Kropotkin in the nineteen century, demonstrating the strength of a cultural lens on evolutionary thought.14 Moreover, does natural selection, as the most important metaphor, fully express how the world evolves ? The basis for this metaphor is anthropomorphic, according to Darwin: "Can the principle of selection, which we have seen is so potent in the hands of man, apply under nature? I think we shall see that it can act most efficiently".15 Also, when man selects, he has a purpose. However, natural selection has been associated with evolution as a purposeless process because of its interdependence on the random nature of events. Nevertheless, Darwin frequently uses teleological expressions associated with a personified Nature acting through natural selection: it is difficult to avoid personifying the word Nature; but I mean by Nature, only the aggregate action and product of many natural laws, and by laws the sequence of events as ascertained by us. [...] It may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, the slightest variations; rejecting those that are bad, preserving and adding up all that are good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being 12 Margulis, Lynn - Symbiotic planet - a new look at evolution. New York: Basic Books, 1998, p. 8. 13 Although symbiotic theory does not deny the role of competition in the reproduction fitness associated with the surviving value within the evolutionary process, it emphasizes the importance of cooperative behavior in terms of adaptive value relatively to non-cooperative behavior. 14 See for example the editorial entitles "Darwin and Culture" in Natures, issue 7268 (Oct. 2009), about the role of cultural lens in the reception of scientific ideas.

Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66 - Fase. 3 • 2010</page><page sequence="5">Rethinking Darwin in Light of a Culture of Communion 623 in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. We see nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has marked the lapse of ages, and then so imperfect is our view into long-past geological ages, that we see only that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were.16 Does moral order drive nature to evolve by natural selection ? (good and bad ) Does natural selection seem purposeless? ("daily and hourly scrutinizing") In fact, as Niklas Pramling acknowledges, teleological reasoning (teleological metaphor) is common in Darwins theorizing.17 Therefore, it can be argued that Darwins metaphorical discourse has limitations and one may wonder what could be the implications of such for cultural inheritance. Namely, we will focus our attention on the challenge posed by Darwins metaphorical discourse in the relation between the worlds evolution and divine providence, i.e. that God 'provides' or cares for the world. In Darwins own words: "It has been said that I speak of natural selection as an active power or Deity; but who objects to an author speaking of the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets?"18 My argument is that metaphors such as struggle for existence and natural selection are cultural products of Darwin s time and influenced our culture in such a way as to deprive the world of Gods providential action because of an increasing gap between the scientific endeavor and culture s religious dimension. For example, it is not easy to harmonize a God who creates the world out of love and the observation that species need to struggle to survive. Also, if nature selects and, thus, sets the course of evolution throughout ages, what role does God play within the framework of evolutionary processes? Such questions represent the cultural challenge posed by Darwin s scientific ideas to the religious view of his time on the meaning of Gods providence and the God-world relationship. And no less important, following Gerd Theissen, they are a reflection of the cultural conflict between flesh and Spirit emerging out of the overlapping between the biological and cultural evolutionary stages, in such a paradoxical way as to where the pressure of selection reduces, culture begins.19 Therefore, considering that culture evolved since Darwin, one may ask if a more adequate cultural paradigm could lead to a rethinking of Darwins metaphors, improving the understanding of their meaning and making sense of the world, and eventually showing a greater compatibility with Gods providential action, than without it. I suggest that a culture of communion can provide such a background for reinterpreting Darwins metaphors, not in the mechanistic or materialist sense, but in order 16 Ibid.., pp. 109, 112-113 (end of 2nd paragraph and 6st paragraph in Ch.

First, I begin by describing the key features of a culture of communion introducing a synthesis on the theological and philosophical reasoning of Chiara Lubich, with significant implications for the understanding of the God-world relationship in light of Darwins evolutionary thought. Secondly, an attempt is made to rethink Darwin s metaphors in light of a culture of communion through the presentation of three cases: 1) struggle for existence ; 2) machinery of life; 3) and natural selection. 3. Culture of Communion Philip Hefner defines culture as "learned and taught patterns of behavior and the symbol systems that contextualize those behaviors both interpreting and justifying them".20 However, it is suggested that the behavior underlying those patterns ultimately depends on our understanding of being and where it is rooted in the ontology of culture, i.e. what is the centrality of the nature/ culture dichotomy. Therefore, the hermeneutic key to start exploring a culture of communion follows the assertion of John Zizioulas that "Being means life, and life means communion", which implies that being is understood here as communion, but it is also suggested that one can root culture in the reality of communion, which is, in this case, an ontological category.21 Furthermore, according to Swimme and Berry, communion is also considered a cosmogenetic principle driving the worlds evolution, which synonyms include interrelatedness, interdependence, kinship, mutuality, internal relatedness, reciprocity, complementarity and interconnectivity,22 all elements underlying the worldview informed by a culture of communion. In this work, the way to explore the meaning of a culture of communion is based on a spirituality of unity underlying in the theological and philosophical insights of Chiara Lubich (1920-2008), founder of the Focolare Movement,23 which is inspired by what has been called the charism of unity.24 20 Hefner, Philip - "Biocultural evolution: a clue to the meaning of nature".

LL Swimme, Brian and Berry, Thomas - The Universe Story. HarperCollins, 1992, pp. 71-72. The Movement is said to have started since Chiara Lubichs consecration to God in December, 7th, 1943, and was officially recognized by the Holy See in December, 5th of 1964 as the Work of Mary. 24 Chiara Lubich was awarded with doctorates honoris causa in theology and philosophy by St. Thomas University, Manila, and Jean Baptiste de la Salle University, Mexico City, in January and June 1997, respectively. Although this movement is a Roman Catholic one, the argument here developed can be widely applicable to other Christian denominations. Also, it should be stressed Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66 - Fase. 3 • 2010</page><page sequence="7">Rethinking Darwin in Light of a Culture of Communion 625 3.1. ynthesis of the theological and philosophical thinking of Chiara Lubich There are seven key ideas in Lubich s proposed spirituality of unity: 1) God is Love; 2) doing God s will is the best way of responding to his love; 3) love of neighbor; 4) carrying out this love, reciprocally and radically; 5) accomplishing unity through reciprocal love; 6) living with the presence of Jesus among us (Mt 18:20); 7) loving the cross by fixing our gaze on Jesus crucified as the key to unity.25 From the charism of unity Lubich delineates a new approach to theology setting its principal cornerstones as: God who is Love; unity; Jesus crucified and forsaken; and Mary. The departure point that God is Love in His very Being is both a source of knowledge and of religious experience ( lJn 4:16). This leads Lubich to propose how Jesus crucified and forsaken reveals to us the Being of the Trinity as Love,26 in the sense that each of the divine persons "is" by making himself "non-being" out of love, establishing a kenotic reading for trinitarian perichoresis. Closely linked with the cornerstone of "God is Love" is unity, where every man and woman is called to live Jesus' teaching that our lives should be modeled according to the life of the Trinity, which He lives in the bosom of the Father (Jn 17:21), through the completion of the commandment of mutual love (Jn 13:34, 15:12). The third cornerstone in Lubich s theological thinking of Jesus crucified and forsaken will be explored later, but a glimpse can be given in her own words when stating that "Jesus forsaken is the God of today also because he is the image of the divisions that exist".27 Finally, and taking into consideration that the Focolare Movement is recognized by the Catholic Church as the Work of Mary, she is the last principal cornerstone of Lubich s contribution to a new theological approach. According to Lubich, Mary "is the flower and first fruit of the Church and of creation, which in her is already Christified, divinized. In a certain way, we can think of her as being set into the Trinity, through grace, as icon and expression of all creation".28 She continues affirming that: "through Christ, in the Spirit, there is also a perichoresis between the Trinity and humanity, which is the apex and synthesis of creation (Jn 17:23), all creation, recapitulated in Christ, is also destined to be, as Mary already is, eternally set into the Trinity: that Lubichs insight on a culture of communion is aimed at establishing a cultural response to the challenges posed by the (neo-)Darwinian worldview, not in its science, but philosophi- cal/theological ground. Lubich, Chiara -Am Introduction to the Abba School - Conversations From the Focolare s Interdisciplinary Study Center, New City Press, 2002, pp. 19-37. 26 Ibid., p. 24 27 Ibid., p. 26 Ibid., p. 28 Revista Portuguesa de Filosofía Vol. 66 - Fase. 3 • 2010</page><page sequence="8">626 Miguel Oliveira Panào that is, to live and rejoice infinitely in the intimate life of God, in the ever-new and unending dynamism of the Trinitarian relationships".29 From the charism of unity, Lubich also delineates a new approach to philosophy, known as the science of the "whys", realizing that "there is a moment in the life of Jesus that is pregnant with answers to all our questions. It is the moment of that great, very great "why" that Jesus addressed to God before dying, his mysterious cry: «My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?» (Mt 27:46)". 30 From this point on, Lubich explores how Jesus forsakens cry of "why" best represents human intelligence in the face of mystery, and how in that "why" are precisely the answer to the many "whys" that are object of philosophical reflection.31 This philosophical approach stands as the analytical ground of the understanding of a culture of communion explored in the following reflections. 3.2. An ontology ofrelationality as cultural response Lubich has recognized, at least in Europe, that God no longer seems to be the one to whom we turn in order to resolve our problems, and that Christian values are less and less the norm, or rarely these days people declare themselves as Christians.32 God seems to be absent and the Gospel is no longer a reference point for values and norms. And similar to the physical light, which we are unable to see unless there is something to illuminate, it is as if Light (God) does not exist, and the result in terms of culture, as stated by the Spanish philosopher Maria Zambrano, is realizing that we are living "one of the darkest nights ever seen".33 Ethics does not keep pace with scientific and technological advancements, creating a dualism between science and wisdom, intellect and heart, and humanity runs the risk of losing control. But Lubich realizes that God is not absent from history and states that "there are many stirrings of a new life going on today in the world, of a new culture, a culture of communion. [...] Each movement, each community, or work, is a response to the collective night that dominates the world. [...] [and] builds networks of fraternity".34 29 Ibid. Ibid., p. 30. Consider the other essays in Lubich (2002) made by members of the "Abba School", an interdisciplinary initiative joining experts in several different fields of knowledge, from natural sciences to humanities, dedicated to the integration of intelligence and holiness in and through Jesus forsaken (Schindler, David in Lubich (2002), "An Introduction to the Abba School", p. 14). 32 Lubich, Chiara - "Per una cultura di communione".

Lubich states that "the way and model of a culture of communion is Jesus crucified and forsaken".35 It is noteworthy that Jesus Forsaken is not a metaphor for Lubich, but an experienced and transforming reality.36 Nevertheless, the question is: how can Jesus Forsaken37 be the basis for a culture of communion? In Lubichs thought, behind the word communion is the unity of the human family, the unity between humanity and nature, and the unity of the world with God, therefore, Jesus Forsaken should be the key to unity if it is to be the way and model of a culture of communion. In fact, Lubich frequently makes the link between the page of mysterious love of unity and the page of mysterious suffering that is Jesus forsaken, such that these are "two faces of the same coin".38 In April 1st of 1948, Lubich writes: "I have experienced that every soul that finds itself in the front lines of Unity, and for Unity, knows how to stand supported only by a Suffering-Love as strong as that of Jesus Forsaken"; thus suggesting that there is an intrinsic link between unity, or communion, and love. And the proper way to fully understand what love is and means is to identify every contradiction of the world with Jesus Forsaken as its image. In fact, "it is Jesus in his deepest suffering! Infinite disunity ... to give us perfect unity that we will reach only relatively here on earth, and then perfectly in heaven", thus, every disunity, or lack of love, or image of Gods apparent absence find its deepest identification in Jesus Forsaken. As claimed by Lubich, "because he [Jesus Forsaken] had been uprooted from both earth and heaven, he brought into unity those who were 'cut off, those who were 35 Ibid., p. 458. Although the discussion henceforth is centered on Jesus Forsaken, it should be noted that in a culture of communion it is both Jesus' forsakenness and resurrection which permeates Lubichs thought. In Povilus, Judith -United in His name. New City Press, 1992, it is stated that "Jesus forsaken is also said to be the means for having Jesus in our midst", which is the same as saying the risen Christ, but she continues asserting that "Chiara [Lubich] speaks of this «relationship of the means to the end,» [...]. And clarifying further, «as Jesus in his abandonment has redeemed humanity, in the sense that he reunited us his children to the Father (he was the means that brought about unity), so too Jesus forsaken, when loved, brings about Jesus in our midst" (p. 74). A typical expression of the Focolare Movement which synthesizes "Jesus crucified and forsaken" in the cry of abandonment "My God, my God, why have your forsaken me?" (Mk 15:34; Mt 27:46). 38 Lubich, Chiara - Essential Writings - Spirituality, Dialogue, Culture. New City Press, 2009, p. 25. Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66 - Fase. 3 • 2010</page><page sequence="10">628 Miguel Oliveira Panão uprooted from God". And relatively to the cry of why of all whys - "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" - Lubich says In that moment he experienced the most profound separation that can ever be imagined; in a sense, he experienced being separated from his Father with whom he was and remained one. At the same time, he gives all humankind a new and fuller unity than the one lost through sin: he reunites all with one another and with God in a new unity [...]. Jesus forsaken is the key to understanding and living out unity.39 Despite all tensions, the world tends to unity.40 In Biology, one of the worlds most known reference textbooks it is states that "as diverse life is, it also displays remarkable unity".41 In a synthesis of philosophical and spiritual terms, Teilhard de Chardin recognized that "true union (that is spiritual union, or union in synthesis) differentiates the elements it brings together. This is no paradox, but the law of all experience. Two beings never love one another with a more vivid consciousness of their individual selves than when each is swallowed up in the other".42 Also in observations of complexification through union, such as self-organization resulting from irreversible processes,43 entities manifest emerging properties whose existence depends on the process of their union.44 Harold Morowitz expressed this ecologically asserting that "all evolution is coevolution, since the species of an ecosystem are all interdependent".45 However, even if evolution tends toward unity in diversity, such unity can only have its cultural expression through its praxis within a culture of communion in what can be called making ourselves one with the other within the conditions of possibility. Such action is not easy and demands the complete emptiness of ourselves: the removal of ideas from our heads, of affections from our hearts, of everything from our wills in order to identify ourselves with the other.46 Only by bringing this making ourselves one 39 Ibid., p. 206. It is noteworthy that "unity" is not the same as "uniformity". "Unity" can only occur in "diversity". 41 Campbell, Neil A., Reece, Jane В., Urry, Lisa A., Cain, Michael L., Wasserman, Steven A., Minorsky, Peter V., Jackson, Robert B. -Biology.

The way and model for this emptiness {ken sis) is Jesus Forsaken (Phil 2:6-7)47 because it is an emptiness out of love, and if it is for love, then Jesus is manifested in those which make themselves emptiness (Jn 14:21)48. Lubich explains that "He shows us, by his being reduced to nothing [...], that I am myself, not when I close myself off from the other, but when I give myself, when out of love I am lost in the other". The empty of ourselves of all we are does not imply that we cease to be and, consequently, that there is no person to identify with the other, because, within a culture of communion, emptying occurs in the gift of ourselves of all we are in a kenotic love.49 In this description we find the dynamics of an ontology of relationality underlying a culture of communion. Therefore, while evolution in the world is seen to tend toward unity, physically manifested in ecological terms by the interconnectedness permeating ecosystems, noetically and culturally manifested in larger networks of fraternity, the key to understand what that unity is, in theological terms within the God-world relationship, has its source of ultimate meaning in the kenotic perspective found in Jesus Forsaken. I suggest that in light of a culture of communion, one is asked to look through the pupil of God s eye on the world50 - Jesus Forsaken - to understand the pain, suffering and death present in the world. Why? Because - in Lubich s own words: Jesus forsaken provides a light for understanding and living the meaning of this drama. Jesus forsaken took upon himself and experienced personally the non-being of creatures [...] [and] out of love, he made his own this non-being that we can call negative, transforming it into himself, into that positive non-being which is Love, as the henceforth, are no longer mine, because I gave them. This giving of my intellectuality, with its contents, to be fully fulfilled is asking of the one who is listening to empty himself of possessing his own truth and, therefore, be capable of welcome the gift of myself to him. [...] In this way, my specific knowledge, my own truth about the object of study, and my intellect - through the dynamics of self-giving - is made a self-nothingness in the intellectual communion with the others" (Rondinara, Sergio - "Dalla interdisciplinarité alla transdisciplinarità: una prospettiva epistemologica!".

Jesus forsaken made the Holy Spirit overflow onto creation, thus becoming 'mother of the new creation.51 At this point, it is important to emphasize the similarity between this new creation associated with Jesus forsaken and Lubichs understanding of the worlds creation. She explains that When God created, all things were created from nothing because He created them from Himself: from nothing means they did not exist because only He existed (but this is unsuitable since in God there is no before or after). He created them from Himself because in doing so He died (of love), died in love, loved and, therefore, created.52 According to the Italian theologian Piero Coda, in this sense, creation is seen as a death , a ken sis of love of God: giving space for the other, making himself the other. Such thinking finds resonance also in that of theologian Jürgen Moltmann when following the Jewish kabbalsitic doctrine of Gods self-limitation (zimsum) he affirms that "in order to create the world 'outside' himself, the infinite God must have made room beforehand for a finitude in himself. Is is only a withdrawal by God into himself that can free the space into which God can act creatively".53 However, according to the Italian philosopher Giuseppe Maria Zanghi, in the Trinity, the "non-being" of Being does not indicate a deprivation, but Love, Communion, i.e. reciprocal self- giving. Therefore, instead of a "withdrawal by God into himself to make room for otherness, as in the doctrine of zimsum, one may understand Gods self-emptying as the kenotic expansion of Being, or as Unlimited Love.54 In another writing, using a language of the Sabbath, where all creation is invited to rest and glorify God,55 Lubich says when we look at nature, it seems that Jesus gives it his new commandment too. I observed two plants and I thought about pollination. Before this happens the plants grow upward, as if they were loving God with all their being. Then they unite, almost as if they were loving one another as the Persons of the Trinity love one another. From two they become one. They love one another to the point of abandonment, to the point of losing their personalities, so to speak, like Jesus in his forsakenness.

It is like God s eternal Life imprinted in nature.56 Therefore, one may wonder: if God loved and, therefore, created, couldn't we think that the world seeks to metaphisically respond to that love and, therefore, evolves?57 Could not evolution be understood, through a culture of communion, as the response of a free and autonomous world, such that Gods creative and providential action in the world includes letting the world be, its autonomy, rather than a manipulative control over it?58 If this is the case, given the worlds autonomy and conditions of possibility, shouldn't we expect an imperfect response to Gods love? Could pain, suffering and death be part of that imperfection? Again, if this is the case, what could be better as Gods response to imperfection than making himself imperfect in Jesus forsaken? If we follow this reasoning, evolution does not result directly from Gods action, but, in a metaphysical way, from the response of the world to Gods love, therefore, in reciprocity, or else, within the dynamics of an ontology of relationality imprinted in the world by a relational Creator God.59 In fact, it is precisely from the perspective of the world as Gods Creation that understanding the nature of God as relational suggests that the fundamental nature of all reality is relational.60 Therefore, a culture of communion has the category of relation as an essential feature common to nature and culture, and, ultimately, its explanatory value is more compatible with God s providential action through reciprocity, than without it. In reciprocity, such action also brings forth what is radically new from within the laws and constraints of nature.61 Hence, how can we rethink Darwin in light of such culture of communion? 4. Rethinking Darwin's metaphors First of all, in a culture of communion, what is thinking? According to Zanghi, the response depends on culture. And thinking, because metaphor based, is culture bound.62 Considering this, as we have seen earlier, the 56 Lubich, Chiara - Essential Writings, p. 141.

Therefore, in the cry of abandonment - "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" - human thinking within a culture of communion is created anew as love. Zanghi argues that "in the Cross event and from resurrection is born thinking as love".63 Therefore, he concludes that thinking is an act of love. In light of this, we could assume that rethinking might be to react on love , in reciprocity, which means accepting Darwins thinking as an act of love and react to his metaphorical discourse on love and search for a deeper meaning in his metaphors in light of a culture of communion. In practical terms, Darwins metaphors are not negated or contradicted but re- thought within a worldview informed by a culture of communion. The three cases that follow seek to illustrate what could be such rethinking. 4.1. The case of Struggle for Existence Darwin thinks of existence in the natural world as a struggle, and in fact, struggle is a form of relationship, therefore, the metaphor struggle for existence could reasonable be rethought as relate for existence, where struggle is included, but also evolution by cooperation, such as symbiogenesis. Within a culture of communion, it is Jesus forsaken who enlightens being, revealing it as love, as communion. And since it is love that is precisely in the dynamic relationship that exists among the three divine Persons of the Holy Trinity, they are Three and yet One because love "is" and "is-not" at the same time.64 Thus, "it is like Gods eternal Life imprinted in nature" (Lubich) that it is not possible to evolve without struggle {is-not) , nor without cooperation (is), but mainly it is not possible to evolve without relation . "On earth all stands in a relationship of love with all: each thing with each thing" (Lubich).65 4.2. The case of Machinery of Life Darwin thinks nature as someone 66 who "can act on every internal organ, on every shade of constitutional difference, on the whole machinery of life . Man selects only for his own good: Nature only for that of the being she tends" [my italics].67 Our biological nature is seen by Darwin as a machine, and while man selects aimed at himself ("for his own good"), Nature selects 63 Zanghì, Giuseppe M. - "O pensar como ato de amor.

In light of a culture of communion, the world is understood to be permeated with webs of relationships, moving toward increased complexity. Therefore, the metaphor of the machinery of life can be reconceived as the known web of life. Furthermore, in a culture of communion, it is not for his or her own good that humankind acts, or selects, but for the good of the other and the community. Consequently, could nature still be thought to select for the "being she tends"? Or could nature be rethought to select for the unity (communion) she tends ? In this way, every event expressing a natural selection would not aim at being alone, but at being with. Therefore, what fundamentally matters is the complex web of relations, dynamically interacting in space and time. If this is the working paradigm, then, being in itself is insufficient. It is being in relation which actually enables survival. 4.3. The case of Natural Selection Darwin thinks of evolution as occurring by natural selection. However, he also recognizes "how infinitely complex and close fitting are the mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life",68 such that "changes in the conditions of life give a tendency to increase variability [and] [...] as man can produce a great result with his domestic animals and plants by adding up in any given direction individual differences, so could natural selection, but far more easily from having incomparably longer time for action".69 Darwin expresses the importance of variability (chance), natural selection and time for a coherent understanding of his theory of evolution. However, in light of an acknowledgement of a culture of communion, such ingredients for evolution have the meaning of contingency, communion and history. In this way of thinking, the worlds evolutionary reality is better understood as a process by which, in the aforementioned words of Teilhard de Chardin, "true union differentiates". Could the most important metaphor of Darwin - natural selection - be rethought as natural communion ? If what sustains the web of life is the outcome of patterns of relationships in the natural world, the relational differences and variations preserved are those which promote a greater communion among, between and beyond species. If this is acknowledged, the difficulty to avoid personifying the word nature, as Darwin felt,70 would eventually be avoided, and evolution in the world would occur by natural communion toward the unity it tends. In brief final remarks, considering all that has been suggested so far, how are we to understand Gods providential action in the evolution of the natural world? In light of a culture of communion: God acts from within through relationships. 68 Ibid., p. 108 (first paragraph in Ch. IV). Ibid., pp. 110-111 (fourth paragraph in Ch. IV).
