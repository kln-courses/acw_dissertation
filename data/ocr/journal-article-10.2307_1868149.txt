Especially did they desert the small, cramped, and leaky sloops for the "relative comfort and less strenuous work" of a ship of the line (p. 193). Often, such desertion was connived at by officers. That the health of seamen was impor- tant to the Admiralty is clear Rodger argues from not only the efficiency of the Victualling Office but also the erection near Gosport of the most modern hospital in Britain. It became the "prototype of a new regime in treating sick seamen, under profes- sional care in buildings designed for the purpose" (p. 110). It also had a twelve-foot wall surrounding the complex to discourage desertion. If it was not actually a charnel house, it certainly resembled a prison hospital. With more than two-thirds of his text devoted to seamen and the rest to their officers, Rodger has probably hit on an acceptable balance. Earlier stud- ies have shown far greater familiarity with the world of the naval officers. Perhaps for this reason the second part of his book seems less novel. Still, the book as a whole is thoroughly refreshing, with a compelling thesis convincingly argued with a formi- dable array of evidence. I began the first chapters rather skeptical of some of his conclusions. I ended by having to recast my own thinking about a body of men I had thought I knew well. JULIAN GWYN University of Ottawa WHITNEY R. D. JONES. David Williams: The Anvil and the Hammer. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press. 1986. Pp. xviii, 266. $29.95. David Williams (1738-1816) was an Enlightenment figure of many roles, and his life serves to remind us of the remarkable enthusiasms unleashed in that age. Protracted into a time of enthusiasms spent, the life equally reminds us that the world may not cherish original minds housed in unclubbable per- sons. This is the first book-length scholarly account of Williams, and a very satisfactory one it is. Whitney R. D. Jones has had to master a large body of materials, for Williams was not an obscure person. Possibly undervalued by contemporaries, clearly dis- liked by many, Williams left a considerable record in books and manuscripts. Among the matters dealt with here is Williams's religious odyssey from con- ventional nonconformity to the further reaches of deism and Unitarianism. This account clarifies a lot about Williams but not the question that occurred to this admirer of his thought: "Are there dissenters other than Protestant Dissenters, and if not, to what general category did people such as he belong?" A career as teacher and theorist on education, the founding of the Royal Literary Fund his obvious monument-and diplomatic ventures, both for re- publican France and for Britain, all have their place here. But the largest part of the story is concerned with the development of an original, often obscure, political theory. The image of hammer and anvil was suggested by Benjamin Franklin's comment about the scheme for a literary fund, when he said that Williams, the hammer, might be worn out by the anvil of the status quo. But, as Jones says, it serves best to chart the progress of Williams as political theorist (p. 158). A radical, reconciled to universal male suffrage by his plan of a pyramid of representation based on small units, Williams could never find common cause with any large movement. Powerfully aware of the dangers of mass politics or of any rapid change, Williams was prone to proclaim the faults of British government in the strongest terms, while offering no ready avenue of improvement. After his experiences in revolutionary France, Williams be- came yet more cautious about advocating reform. This treatment contributes some compelling new evidence of the degree to which Williams was rec- onciled, in later life, to British institutions, although Jones is careful to insist on the continuities in his political thought. Among the insights to be found inJones's analysis is the suggestion that Rousseau may well have been an inspiration for Williams's social organicism, cul- minating in the effort to locate and develop a "sensorium" for society similar to the human ner- vous system. Jones also offers the happy thought that Williams seems to have sought to make society a sort of person to compensate for the element of anthropomorphism that he had ruled out of his religious faith (p. 178). Less convincing is the recur- rent effort to liken Williams's organism to Tudor categories, for this surely tells us more about our author's previous work on the sixteenth century than about Williams in the eighteenth. Throughout, Jones shows sound judgment in never claiming too much for the originality or influence of his subject. Possibly he could even have been more sympathetic to Williams's efforts at inventing a vocabulary for the understanding of public opinion. It is hard to quarrel much with the painstaking research and judicious use of evidence found here, but two minor objections may be warranted. One must resist the notion that Williams could ever have agreed with the categories of John Reeves, the high Tory (p. 140). Second, consultation of the article on Williams in the Biographical Dictionary of Modern British Radicals would have told Jones that the manu- script by Williams in the Pelham papers, British Library, was already known. This is a pleasantly-written book, well argued and without pretension. If anything, claims are under- stated.
