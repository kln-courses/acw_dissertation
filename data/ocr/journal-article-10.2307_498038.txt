<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PAZIRIK BURIAL OF ALTAI PLATES I-VI INTRODUCTION THE growth of the science of archaeology and the increase in popular interest have been very noticeable during recent years. The areas of Western Europe, the Medi- terranean, Egypt and Mesopotamia especially, have been attracting a great number of specialists and the amount of information accumulated has already reached the stage where no one student can hope to master it. At the same time many regions beyond these remain virtually terrae incognitae. Yet many problems in archaeology are awaiting additional information from the vast territory of Eastern Europe and Asia. It has been pointed out by many specialists that the Old Stone Age cannot be completely understood without data from this region. Likewise the origin and development of many phases of the Neolithic Age seem to point eastward also. The striking similarity between painted ceramics from Cucuteni (Moravia) and those of Tripolie (South Russia) and Anau (Russian Turkestan) has been pointed out. Modern students of Mesopotamia look to Armenia and the Caucasus for the solution of many of their problems. Not less striking is the distribution of the so-called "animal style" found in such widely separated areas as Hungary, South Russia, Siberia and China.1 The tre- mendous gap in distribution and in the sequences of style variation is being gradually filled in by works of Kozlov,2 Borovka 3 and others. Recently Mr. Roerich has found traces of the animal style among the present nomads of Tibet.4 Much information can be derived from a series of excavations conducted by the State Russian Museum in Leningrad in the region of Altai. One of the most out- standing discoveries was made in the so-called Pazirik Burial, an account of which is given below, and which furnished us with valuable data concerning the mode of life of these ancient nomadic groups which seem to have been the disseminators of so many cultural elements. During my visit to Leningrad in 1931, I had the opportunity of personally examin- ing the Pazirik finds, and securing information and photographic material. Mr. M. P. Griaznov, the excavator of Pazirik has graciously given me permission to publish an account of this discovery, preliminary notices of which appeared in Russian 5 in 1930. The article presented below represents a combination of my translation of an article specially written by Mr. Griaznov, with additional mate- rial which I have taken the liberty of including from his articles referred to above.

Each nomadic group moved freely only within the limits of its region, and was in fact closely connected with it. This connection of nomadic groups with the territory of their movements is es- pecially apparent from the burial customs. Regardless of the place where this or that nomad died, if he had occupied any position in his group, he would necessarily be buried near his ancestors in the cemetery of his clan. The deceased was carried for hundreds of kilometers to be interred with his forefathers. It was done thou- sands of years ago. It is done now. The group of kurgans of Scythian kings is un- (loubtedly of this origin. This is also true of the chains of enormous kurgans in the valley of the Chu river (Khirghisian A. S. S. R.), which evidently represent the clan burial grounds of chiefs or notables of the Saks tribe. We have the same picture in the group of Noin-Ula kurgans, where are buried "Shaniuys" 2 of Huns and other noblemen, and in the series of other groups of rich burials in many other places as yet not investigated.(b) All this points to the custom of the nomads of burying their chiefs, military leaders and other noblemen in the clan burial grounds. The presence in a certain region of rich burials of nomads does not necessarily mean that the nomads actually lived there. It simply means that this region was included in the territory belonging to the nomads buried there, and as often as not this region may be situated on the periphery of their land. Doubtless this is the case with the large stone kurgans of Altai. More than a hundred such kurgans are scattered in various valleys of the Altai mountains, which are ill-suited for free migrations. The kurgans of Altai are situated among the mountains in small groups of chains running from north to south. They represent small clan burial grounds of the leaders. These kurgans have been little investigated. In 1865, V. V. Radlov ex- cavated two such kurgans, one in the upper part of the Katune River near the village of Katanda, and another in the upper part of the Bukhtarma River, on the Berel River.' In both kurgans excavated by Radlov, the burial was in a condition of continual frost, in consequence of which the objects were found in an unusual state of preservation. The very complex construction of the wooden burial chamber was ideally preserved as well as the numerous art objects of wood and birch bark, rich fur-clothing covered by Chinese silks, and many wooden, gold-covered decora- tions. In spite of the brilliant results of Radlov's excavations, the Altaian kurgans have remained uninvestigated for more than sixty years. In the region of the mountains 1 See the translator's notes at the end of the article. The letters a, b, c, etc., refer to these notes. 2 Chiefs. 3 W. W.

P. GRIAZNOV, EUGENE A. GOLOMSHTOK of Altai there were no scientific investigations or study of antiquities after Radlov outside of the work of Adrianov in 1911 on the Bukhtarma River.' It is only since 1924 that Altai has become the object of systematic archaeological investigations organized by the Ethnographical Section of the State Russian Museum in Leningrad. The expeditions of the Russian Museum conducted excavations in different regions of Altai during a number of years, endeavouring to discover all types of archaeological remains to be found in the Altai region. In 1927 the time came to excavate the large stone kurgans similar to those investigated by Radlov. In the central part of the Altai Mountains in the locality of Shiba on the Ursula River, the author excavated a rich burial of a chief belonging, to judge by the objects found, to the period shortly before the Christian era.2 This burial was also subject to continual frost which resulted in a wonderful preservation of the materials. In spite of the fact that it had been robbed long ago, the materials obtained were so rich and various that it was possible on the basis of the finds to form a sufficiently detailed picture of the culture, as well as of the construction of the society and the social relations. (c) Among the objects found in the Shiba burial especially interest- ing to us are the mummified corpses, the bridles, the carvings in cedar and the de- signs cut out of the bark of the poplar tree in the characteristic "Scythian animal style," the digging implements (wooden spades and bone picks) and numerous dec- orations stamped on gold.3 The expedition of 1929 excavated a second similar burial in the Eastern Altai near Pazirik (Yan-Ulaghan River). Here also the burial was in a condition of perpetual frost. Thanks to the peculiar combination of circumstances all objects found in the grave were firmly cemented by the ice, in consequence of which the processes of decay were completely arrested. It seemed as if the hand of time had not touched the objects which had been lying in the grave more than two thousand years. The ten yellow mares which had been buried with the man were preserved so well that not only skin and hair, but muscles, and entrails with the remains of undigested food in them were found. On the handle of an axe discovered there could be seen the shiny surface, polished by the hands of the man using it, as if this axe were left yesterday and not thousands of years ago. This exceptional state of preservation of the objects in the Pazirik burial puts it in a class by itself among all other burials found in Siberia. The materials of the Pazirik kurgan illuminate with unusual brilliancy the different sides of the economic and social life of the nomads, who buried their chiefs in the moun- tains of Altai. The Pazirik kurgan is situated 1500 meters above the sea level in the dry bed of an ancient glacier. It is one in the chain of five kurgans stretching from north to south. The investigated kurgan represents a stone-pile mound some two and one- 1 A. V. Adrianov, "The Archaeology of Western Altai," Izvestia of the Archaeological Commission, :St. Pet., 62, 1916. 2 The most accurate indications of the dating of the Shiba burial are to be found in a fragment of a Chinese lacquer cup discovered there. Prof. S. Umehara very kindly dated this cup on the basis of its .ornamentation between 86 and 48 B.c. 3 On the Shiba burial, see the author's article in the Wiener Prdhistorischen Zeitschrift, XV, 1928.</page><page sequence="4">THE PAZIRIK BURIAL OF ALTAI 33 half meters in height and fifty meters in diameter (Fig. 1). The very indefinite form of the stone mound and the hardly perceptible depression on its top indicated an ancient robbery of the burial beneath, a supposition confirmed by excavation. Under the stone pile was discovered an earthen mound of similar form but of smaller :-::i; FIG. 1.--PAZIRIK. GENERAL VIEW. THE EXCAVATED KURGAN IN THE CENTER dimensions, with a well-pronounced funnel-like pit on the site of the robbers' excava- tions. Finally under this earth mound, in the centre of the construction over the grave was a square grave-pit with vertical walls. Its area was 53 m. square (7.2 x 7.2) and 4 m. deep (Fig. 2).  Ii! ! o . 3, FIG. 2.-CROSS SECTION OF THE MOUND SHOWING CONSTRUCTION OF BURIAL CHAMBER The enormous pile of stones over the burial has created the most favorable condi- tion for its preservation, since the loose stones are bad conveyers of heat, and at the same time the cold, heavy air easily penetrates the lowest layers of the pile. As a result, everything situated under the stone pile freezes during the first frost of winter, which begins in this locality about August and ends in June. In summer</page><page sequence="5">34 M. P. GRIAZNOV, EUGENE A. GOLOMSHTOK the frozen ground has no time to thaw, as the stone and earth mound has not been thoroughly heated through. Besides this, the cold lower layers of the stone pile serve as very strong condensers of the humidity from the air. Consequently, there was a large quantity of water both in the mound and in the grave pit proper. The Pazirik burial was found filled with water which was frozen, and the processes of decay were stopped in their very beginning. Thus it seems that large stone mounds in regions of high altitude create the best conditions for the conservation of objects against the actions of time. The inside appearance of the burial gave the impres- .. . 3.. ...... . . 7 -- . ,'3.I i"~- 2 ..___ m FIG. 3.-GROUND PLAN OF THE BURIAL sion that hardly a year had passed since its construction. The very timber out of which the burial chamber was built had not only preserved its original shape and quality but had retained its fresh smell of pitch. The wooden chamber of the deceased did not occupy all of the grave pit. It was situated in the southern larger half of the grave. The chamber, to- gether with the floor was con- structed of boards and al- though the room was spacious, the log ceiling was low. Over this chamber was another en- closure made of logs with a log ceiling. The space be- tween the walls of this double chamber was filled with loose stones. All this construction occupied the southern part of the grave and contained the burial of the deceased and the grave furniture. In the northern smaller part were deposited the bodies of horses killed for the burial (Fig. 3). Over the chamber and the bodies of the horses were placed about three hundred thick logs, evidently to prohibit robbers from entering. To prevent this mass of heavy logs and the layer of earth over them from crushing the wooden construction of the burial chamber there were three pairs of special pole-braces which supported the whole weight of the logs and earth. In spite of all precautions on the part of the builders, the burial had been plun- dered. The robbers dug a shaft in the centre of the kurgan mound and reached the pile of logs. There they cut a wide passage with axes and reached the ceiling. Here they made a small circular hole through which they took everything from the burial chamber that was in their opinion valuable. To make their work easier they apparently dragged the body itself outside, to be better able to strip it of its gold decorations. When they had finished, hardly anything was left.

It was covered with the bark of the "tcheremuha" tree glued to the surface and decorated by an applique of bird-figures cut out of leather (d) (Plate I). On the wall of the chambers here and there were copper and wooden nails and pieces of felt. The walls once were covered with a thick, black felt carpet decorated with a border of thin felt of many colors with representations of 'mo ml . . . ... ... .. ...... .. NT.

This is the reason so few objects were found in the burial chamber itself. The northern part of the grave escaped the robbers.

The celt itself was carried away by the robbers. This section of the grave was preserved exactly as it was left by the constructors of the kurgan. Under the thick layer of birch and fir bark were corpses of ten horses with a corresponding number of saddles and trappings. The horses were killed by a blow from a sharp axe on the forehead and were thrown into the bottom of the grave pit. In disorder, in various poses, they filled the nar- row space between the outer wall and the northern side of the grave pit (f) (Fig. 6).

The construction of the saddles is very simple (Figs. 7, 8, 9). They were made of two soft pillows of finely tanned leather and felt, stuffed with reindeer hair. There is a belly-strap, a breast-strap (to prevent backward sliding), a tail-strap (to prevent forward sliding). There was no wooden foundation for the seat and there were no stirrups. A square piece of felt was placed under the saddle to prevent chafing. :?''";:"' is ji, : J:-8iii.:-:BI-P~PI :: ?iiii:i-i:ijii iiiii-;ii~;ii-iji-:~~~ia i:ifi~-ii:ii ?::: -i - ?::- :-':l'?':''':?''iii:i:i:::iiiiiiii- :ili?i i:iiiiiiriiili ::-i:i:iiii::i:i:iii:i:i i:i:'i'' ai i:i iiii -ii-i iii:.::: i-i-:i?i :iii-i::i-i-iiiii ::j::: ::: :::::::::::- -::- ::: ::: :::ii::-:iii:::i: ii:iiiii-i:i-i:i-i-iiiiiii i:iiiii-,ii--::::: :i:i-i._iiii::i::iiii:ii:: i: ii: : -: :--__ -: :::::::::::-::_ ili:i~i::i-: i:- i-i iiiili:i-i-iiiiiiiiii:i:i:iii-i:i:i-iiii ::-:: :: :: -:-':-::-:-: ::- iir---:- :'--:i:: -ii-:i-i-ii 2-i8:':::_-:-i::: :::::::-:- :: - - :- i:i-:-:iii-iiiiiiii ::::---,a ::::: :::: :::::-;:::::-:::i:?::_i:i::l:c-:::: :::i ._::~? :::: .iiiiiiiiiii:ji:i~i- ~i~iii:i-i-i:;i'Bii-.i8;i-i i:-::::::::::::: ':::::::::::: :::':::- :ii:j:::---lj-: ::i: :: ::?:::-::-:--::--:-::ii-i-i-:::.::i:i ::::i:~_i:::::::::::: ::-..-.:: isi7c::_::?::: _: - -:-:-_-~:ri::-: ::::-:j ::::::::::::: iij~~ --::_iiiii--_:s_-- :::_:_ii :':'::'i-l,: ii,:;-i-ii--ii:~~iiiii --i~!iii.:.:':iE';''i iiiiiii ii~ji--,:j: ::_ii~~ii-:NI ::j-: --...-.-_ ;;:-:~_~:-:; ::i:-:::-:_l --.' _-:::::::'::-:::; ii~ le2~if~t :_::::i:::::i:? ~~1:ri;;.i :~a i-i'uii-i;~iira:::: ::":: iii'i-~~ia- I:l::i:il:::n:i ia;i:,:,,,:::::::: :::::i:i i:?;?: ii-iiii.ii: i:iiiii?iii .: i:i:--ii:i:i:ii:iiii-iii ~ 3Cqs~ ~ls~BIBg%~j~%L~e~~i~~~i~?~ .:.. -_-_---:iii : ::--:::::::-ii:::---::----i---:i-i:_;i ~;' i-c%:~iiiii~i~~:-;~~~;i I;~iiijiiiii'l:~i-Ii~:iiiiii:i ii:'ii;ii3iii- -. i---i-i-iiairii -i--i:i::i:~:i% i:::-:::: i- :'i: -?:---~:-- : ::: -:_::-::.:::: ilr:::-?::::::::i :: :i:;:::ii a i--:~ -li__~ ~i:~i ::?::::j::-:: 1: . ~i itii~:-:ii iii:ii --:: . -: :i?i?iii-i-i:ii-ii:i i:i:.iiiiii:i:i:_i _:::::j::::::: i::::_:::j:::: ; :::* ::::':::: :: :::::-:::' i i:i.::: r:::::::;;(_i:?: ::::::1 i:::;::::? i: ::: --ii:i-i.i:,:ii:i-iii:iiii ::i:--::::.:l:?:_:i?:i::-::?iii-iiii:i.i :: ::::::::::::::: iii i': i:i-iii-_:-----:?_: --- ---i -:i:~ i-- i:--:--:-::-. : :' ::---:'--?:::: -:: ::--:-:':-:::::: :i'i-:i:i-:i:ii:i'liii-iiii::iili:aii ::: ?:i::::: ?:: -:-:-:::-:::-:--: :::::::::::::::: :i-l::::i::_::::::::;-i-;-::: :::::::::::-:::_::: .... :::.:. .. i::s::---:j?:_.- ::, ... :i:i?~ii?iiii-:i~-iii .:-z:i:iiiii--i::i:: :: :?:::?-::i:: -- ':: i -:;:_::-:.i.-:: :i:-j:_:':l:_::::: :: : i:i:li:'i:i:-:i:-:::::::::: .. ~--:??::-:i .i_ :?-':':_ii-i-?.i?i ::.:. i-i -:i:,:,::::- _:_:::::::::::-i :-:- ?_-:::j .----:-: -i::::: :::::-: ::-.:: - ...:..- :? - _- '__- -j-_-: :;--_--_-_-:--__i :: :::: ; ::i:i:.:::: --.-:-.__.__-. :::::::::::::::j::i::,::,:,,,;,,?iiiii:: : : :-:':'::: : :: : ~ :-::-:-:i:--::i- :-::--':'i:::::i::i?iieiiiiiii,: :'::i -: :-.i --i--::i- : ,: ::: :' ': :?:: :::: :: FIG. 9.-SADDLE IN EMBROIDERY AND APPLIQUE SHOWING ANIMAL STYLE Over the pillows were placed special covers made out of fine thin felt, with felt or leather trappings hanging on both sides. The cover was usually decorated with scenes of animal combats in applique work (Plate II, A, B, C). This style is well known from the gold plaques found in Siberia (g). The decorations on the saddle trappings also represent animals or parts of them. The breast-straps and bridles are covered by plaques carved out of cedar and gilded or silvered. Here also ani- mal representations predominate. One is struck by the diversity of subjects, the technique of execution and richness of design. Altogether more than forty different representations embodying the animal style were utilized. All saddles and bridles were of the same type. The bridle, besides the main strap over the head, has one over the nose and forehead and one under the chin (Figs. 10, 11). The bits are simple, one of bronze, the rest of iron. All bridles are of wood and were decorated with numerous designs carved in low relief and covered with gold or silver leaf (h) (Figs. 12-16, Plate III). This find is very important, since, up to the present time in Scythian burials we have found few remains of saddles, except those at Sebastopol. Only on some de-</page><page sequence="9">38 M. P. GRIAZNOV, EUGENE A. GOLOMSHTOK signs and on one plaque have we schematic representations of saddles, but owing to their small size it has been impossible to form an idea of their construction. Especially rich were the decorations of two horses. Besides the saddles and bridles, near their heads were buried ornamented leather covers for the tails and similar covers for the manes and finally masks for the heads. The latter are of unusual interest. On the head of one of the horses was a mask made of leather, felt, fur and gold leaf in the shape of a reindeer's head with horns of natural size (Figs. 17-19).

The latter has large wings and a sculptured head with bull's horns. The gilded figure of the bear covered the upper lip, nose and forehead of the horse. The figure of the griffin covered the cheeks and its beautiful wings towered from the top of the horse's head. The wings occupied the place of the reindeer's horns on the first mask. All of this was colored, silvered and gilded. These masks are interesting for us inasmuch as they tend to confirm the theory of N. Y. Marr concerning the order in which the domesticated animals were utilized for travel. On the basis of linguistic materials, Marr has sought to establish the fact that the reindeer as an animal for transportation purposes preceded the horse. In a recently published work (1928) on the origin of the domestication of the reindeer, Professor Maximov agrees with Gann, Laufer and Gatt, that the Altai- Sayan region was the centre of distribution of the domesticated reindeer, but he thinks that reindeer breeding is a later acquisition of culture, being as it were, the result of the domestication of horse and cattle. It is possible that in the Altai- Sayan region reindeer were used in antiquity for riding and that the type of saddle found in our kurgan or perhaps an even more primitive type originated for use with the reindeer and was only later used for the horse.</page><page sequence="10">'''-"'-"tii:ii`?i-ii-.??,: : :: -::?: :.:.:: ::: ::: :-: .: : :::-: : : . :.

The buried horses are the same animals which were used during the life of the master and his burial procession; they follow the master to the other world. If the reindeer was the basic means of transportation among the natives, it was necessary for him to follow them to the hereafter. With the substitution of the horse for the reindeer in economic life, the latter was preserved in the rituals. Later the conservative ritual demanded the masking of the horse as a reindeer. By the time of the kurgan in question, the horse had completely taken the place of the reindeer as a means of transportation and even the meaning of the participation of the reindeer in the burial ceremony is forgotten. While one mask has typical reindeer horns, the second deviates considerably from the original model. Under later cultural influences, appears the horned head of the griffin and the place of the reindeer horns are occupied now by the wings of the griffin. Considerable time must have elapsed for the change to have taken place in the ceremony. Here we have the material confirmation of the theory of Marr. It is impossible in this short article to describe with any degree of completeness all the finds made in the part of the burial occupied by the horses. There are shields made out of sticks sewed together with interlacing strips of leather and hung on the right side of the saddles. In spite of their small size it is evident that we are dealing with armour. We recognize in them the shields known to us from representations of fighting Scythians on the gold of Greek manufacture from the kurgan, Solokha. There were also found fur bags for provisions; one is made from the head of a lynx, having a corresponding form, the other is cylindrical in shape with a round leather bottom. Both are decorated and are made from pieces of leather and fur of different colours. They are in a beautiful state of preservation and form exceptional objects for archaeological museums. The variety of technique and design is striking. Eagles and moose, reindeer and mountain goat, bears and griffins, birds and fish, figures in "flying gallop," single heads, peculiar combinations of animals, the head of one in the mouth of another, carnivorae attacking animals from mountains and forests with the characteristic bent back head, in numerous combinations and variations, disclose a very rich but so far little known culture. The great majority of decorations, with the exception of a comparatively small series with plant motifs, are adorned with a very characteristic and very peculiar animal style. In the decorations of saddle trappings, wool, leather, thin felt, fur, and horse hair are employed, embellished with silver and gold, red, blue and yellow pigments. Absolutely unique examples of art were thus created. It is necessary to mention the finds in the upper part of the grave pit. There, among the logs, were discovered two yokes for bulls and the parts for an arba.' Evidently we are dealing here with the very widespread custom of leaving in the grave of the deceased the vehicle on which the body was carried. The arba, to judge by the well preserved upper longitudinal axis was of small dimensions and was very likely two-wheeled. The yoke was very simple, in the form of a stick with holes in the centre for fastening to the shaft and two pairs of holes on the ends, 1 I.e., a cart.</page><page sequence="13">42 M. P. GRIAZNOV, EUGENE A. GOLOMSHTOK for the sticks placed on the sides of the bull's neck. It should be pointed out, that among the numerous objects found in the burial there is nothing which could indi- cate a foreign origin. The whole complex of finds is exclusively of local manufac- ture. Usually in the large kurgans (Noin-Ula, Shiba, Katanda) some objects of Chinese and Greco-Bactrian origin are encountered. Perhaps it can be explained by the fact that Pazirik is situated in high, hardly accessible mountains, far from any trade or cultural routes. Consequently the finds of Pazirik represent the product of local Siberian culture, widely distributed beyond the borders of Siberia, but very much changed there owing to influence of neighboring cultures, such as Chinese and es- pecially Greek. Such is the case in many Scythian kurgans of South Russia which are so impregnated with the elements of Greek culture that their basic native color is hardly noticeable. The main occupation of the constructors of Pazirik was herding. We are led. to this conclusion by the natural conditions of the country, where agriculture was impossible to any large degree, as it is today. The whole complexion of the local industry indicates that we are dealing primarily with herding peoples. Of course this does not exclude hunting as an occupation. The moose, reindeer, mountain goat and bear, the favorite motives in decorative art, are executed with a knowl- edge possible only to people who have observed them directly in life. The horse and sheep of many colors (black, white and brown) were the main domesticated animals. The burial of horses with the deceased of all classes shows that we are dealing essentially with a horse-using people. The numerous felt objects made of sheep's wool of different colors and of different quality indicate very well developed sheep herding. The material obtained gives us data about various technical processes and the comparatively rich and complex social structure. The Pazirik kurgan is a monu- mental structure, requiring a considerable number of workmen for the earth, stone and wood work, demanding organized means of transport to erect this structure in a short time. Hundreds of logs were used for the building. That both axes and adzes were used is seen from the traces of the tools on the numerous logs and thick boards. Wood carving was very highly perfected, perhaps with the use of special knives. The remains of textiles are insufficient to determine the place of origin. Though bone work is absent here, the technique of bone work and bone carving was well known and was well developed as can be seen from the beautiful examples of it in Katanda and Ursula kurgans. Felt making, leather tanning, and the prepara- tion of furs were also very highly developed. We have examples of the different types of felt, from the thick and rough type to the thinnest, finest kind, rivaling the modern machine-made felt. The finer type was used mostly for decorative pur- poses. Quite as diverse was the leather work. It varies from the thick belts for the saddles to the thinnest leather cut out in various designs. Well tanned furs were well preserved in spite of the fact that they were for a considerable time in the water and then in the ice. There is no decoration of twined horse-hair but it was utilized as a medium of decoration. Dyeing methods were well known. Felt, fur, leather and hair were dyed with red, yellow and blue pigments. Both vegetable</page><page sequence="14">THE PAZIRIK BURIAL OF ALTAI 43 and mineral dyes were used in solution as well as on glue. Pottery was present, large vessels being well fired. There are reasons to think that metallurgy was developed. Mining may have been practiced, though we have found no actual mines as yet. From the complex excavations conducted in making burial pits seven and more meters deep, one might conclude that mining was possible. Bronze and iron tools were widely used and gold was most likely one of the main articles of im- port. In the burials of the ruling class many gold objects were found. The population was well versed in the technique of silvering leather and wood; various objects were decorated with thin gold leaf, the designs being pressed out and glued. The perfection of the carved-out wood and cut-out leather objects, together with the jewelry, prove the existence of specialists and perhaps a separate class of artisans. The people to whom the Pazirik burial belongs were a sedentary or semi-sedentary group, as is natural considering the geographical condition of the country where the herding even today is combined with a sedentary mode of life. This is also indicated by the presence of pottery, by the fundamental log structure in the grave, showing the knowledge of house construction. The details of the burial chamber tell us something about house construction. The social organization was that of the clan type with the head of the clan as the leader, as far as it is possible to surmise on the basis of the domestication of ani- mals as the economic base. More than likely, we are dealing here with a period leading to the decay of clan organization. The character of the burials allows us to surmise the existence of three economic groups-that of the rich, middle class and poor. Along with this we have indications of a well-formed concept of private property as is shown by the property marks on domesticated animals. The buried horses have cuts on the ears, some on the right, some on the left, one, two or three, showing that the horses belonged to different individuals. We know from Hero- dotus that Scythians carried the bodies of kings among conquered tribes and those of noblemen among friends, each place providing the funeral festivity. Food and presents were given to the deceased. Among those presents may have been horses. The horse was the means of transportation. It was ridden and also used for carrying heavy objects. Logs were dragged by a method used today, viz., by mak- ing a hole in one end of the log and fastening a rope through it to the horse. Boats may have been known, at least the dug-out type made in the same way as the sarcophagus. Objects of decorative art are numerous in the burial. Their technical details and subject matter make it possible for us to assert that we are dealing with Scytho- Sarmatian or Scytho-Siberian art expressed in realistic forms and presenting us with unique examples not possessed up to this time. The plant motifs are very interesting but the animal style is of exceptional importance. The force of the artistic execution, the mastery of design, and well developed style are remarkable. Even if there were borrowings, the treatment was very original. To summarize: it is evident that the excavated burial belongs to one of the tribes of Eastern Altai, which herded animals as a major occupation and which, during the several centuries before our era dominated the vast territory from Mongolia to the</page><page sequence="15">44 M. P. GRIAZNOV, EUGENE A. GOLOMSHTOK Carpathian mountains. They seemed to possess a very similar culture, known from the times of Herodotus under the collective names of Scythians, Sarmatians, Massa- getians, etc. Precise dating cannot as yet be given. The excavations of the Pazirik kurgan have opened for us one of the pages of history of the nomadic world of the Asiatic steppes. In the valley of Pazirik there still remain four more similar kurgans belonging very likely to other members of this clan. The excavation of these, which is included in the plan of the immediate future, will reveal several other pages as yet closed to us. These excavations are very important, as they may enable us to determine more accurately the chrono- logical succession of the. burials by the remains of the wood and therefore to place the material studied in a definite sequence, which up to now, at least in the region of Europe and Asia, has not been done. M. P. GRIAZNOV</page><page sequence="16">THE PAZIRIK BURIAL OF ALTAI 45 TRANSLATOR'S NOTES (a) This is similar to the well known boundary restriction of the hunting territories among the north- ern tribal groups of North America. (b) The kurgans of Noin-Ula in Mongolia where the burials of Hun (?) chiefs were disclosed were excavated by the expedition of P. K. Kozlov. Objects of gold, bronze, copper, Chinese silk with richly embroidered "animal style" designs, woolen textiles with decorations in a Greek style, remains of clothing, etc. were found. See P. K. Kozlov, "The Noin-Ula Monuments," S. A. Teplouhov, "Excava- tion of the Noin-Ula Kurgan," and G. I. Borovka, " The Cultural and Historic Significance of the Kozlov Expedition," in the volume, Northern Mongolia, Russian Academy of Sciences, Leningrad, 1995 (in Russian). (c) The plundering of the burials seems to be a quite ancient occupation. A great majority of burials, especially those which have any distinguishing marks such as earth construction, or rows of stones, have been robbed in antiquity as well as in recent times by plunderers seeking the gold objects so often found there. (d) This motive of birds in opposition was achieved by cutting a piece of leather which had been folded double. It is very similar to the designs of Tungusian tribes of the Amur river (Plate II, D), who used the same method of folding and cutting the birch bark to obtain the double or quadruple designs. (e) The head of a lion or tiger is employed very frequently as a decorative motive in "Scytho-Si- berian" cultures. Thus we have ornamental plaques from the horse trappings of cast bronze from the Crimea (the barrow near Eltegen, Borovka, op. cit., plate 16 A and D) and from the Dnieper district, Kiev Grmt (Ibid., B and C). Not less striking is the similarity to the ornamented plaque of carved wood and horn from Siberia (Fig. 90, after Borovka, op. cit., plate 60, e; 61, g). (f) Quite contrary to all expectations the Pazirik horse is not of the well known type of wild horse found in Siberia (Equus Przevalskii), or the short sturdy Kirghizian type, but shows evidence of long domestication and breeding, reminding one of the racing type found among the Arabs. (g) The representation of two fighting animals has a very wide distribution, and is found in Meso- potamia, Palestine, Greece, etc. No one can deny the cultural affinity of the Siberian gold plaques P1. VI (Cf. Rostovtzeff, plates XV, XIV) and especially a group on a gold ornament from the "Seven Brothers " (Fig. 21, after Rostovtzeff, Iranians and Greeks, plate XIII) with the designs on the Pazirik saddle covers. The method of representation, the stylistic details are similar. Perhaps the nearest analogy is the design on a large carpet from Mongolia, woven with applique work in purple, brown and white. (P1. IV, after Borovka, plate 73). Here we also have an elk bent by the weight of an attacking griffin. The outlines are stitched with cord. (h) The graceful representation of a young elk lying down (Fig. 15) is executed with a degree of taste and mastery of technique almost unparalleled. The animal's feet are drawn under, as in so many examples from South Russia and Siberia. The profile of the head, the mode of representing the ears, legs and hoofs is almost identical with that on the ornamented plaque of carved wood from Altai (P1. V, A, after Borovka, plate 59) or with the gold ornament from the shield (?) from Kostromskaya, Stanitza, Kuban district of VII-VI c. B.c. (P1. V, B, after Borovka, plate I). The peculiar back turn of the head is likewise very often met in examples of "Scytho-Siberian" art. Rostovtzeff (plate VII, top) reproduces horse trappings of bone from the Shumeiko farm where a very similar figure is incised. Compare also the figure on the pole top of cast bronze from Ulski Aul in the Kuban district (Borovka, table 94); the ornamented gold plaque from Donetz district, Gov. Kharkov (Borovka, plate 3 d); the bronze plaque from Minusinsk, Siberia (Borovka, table 43 c); a figure of a running deer from a brass charm box from Derge, Mongolia (Roerich, table II 3). Perhaps the nearest analogy can be seen in the animal figure carved of wood with holes for the horns from the Katanda grave in Altai (Borovka, table 63 b). EUGENE A.
