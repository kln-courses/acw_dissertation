<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SOCIAL LIFE OF MONKEYS AND APES Second Edition S. ZUCKERMAN President, Zoological Society, London 'I do not claim to have given a complete account of the social lives of animals I have studied but, so far as I could, have considered all the available and relevant facts. My own observations have been made without, I hope, anthropomorphic bias, and my interpretations have been weighted with no more than the insistence of the facts themselves.' -From the author's Preface to the First Edition Zuckerman's classic observations of non-human primates provided a vital impetus to the primate research of the past fifty years, and his ideas still stimulate much discussion. In this, the second edition, the author has added a commentary and supplemented the original study with appendices which survey the published literature of the subject during the last fifty years. 496 pages, $55.00 Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul 9 Park Street, Boston, Mass. 02108 The Evolutionary Synthesis / Perspectives on the Unification of Biology\ / Ernst Mayr and William B.

ROSEN, editors Opposed to the more traditional theories of species distribution by natural dispersal, the theory of vicariance biogeography contends that distribution can also be the result of the splitting apart of continents and other major geological events. The contributors to Vicariance Biogeography contrast the two theoretical positions in essays which probe the crucial issues of species distribution and diversification. 584 pages, $30.00 The Foraging Strategy of Howler Monkeys A Study in Primate Economics KATHARINE MILTON In this account of her extensive field research in the lowland tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island in Panama, Katharine Milton describes the forag- ing strategy of one highly successful primate primary consumer -the mantled howler monkey Alouatta palliata-and explains how it has over- come many of the problems inherent in a plant-based diet. 192 pages, illus., $20.00 Phylogenetic Patterns and the Evolutionary Process Method and Theory in Comparative Biology NILES ELDREDGE and JOEL CRACRAFT This fresh and imaginative investigation joins together two disparate themes in comparative biology: systematics, the ordering of the elements of the earth's biota, and evolutionary theory, the explanation of how that order arose and continues to arise. Written in nontechnical prose and including an extensive bibliography, the book is of interest to both the student and professional biologist. 384 pages, $27.50 Phylogenetic Analysis and Paleontology JOEL CRACRAFT and NILES ELDREDGE, editors This debate on a variety of issues in contemporary systematic biology and their relation to paleontology "succeeds in bringing together a diversity of viewpoints, sometimes antithetical, on the relationship between fossil evidence and phylogenetic reconstruction." -Science.

In Systematics and Biogeography, the authors investigate the theoreti- cal structure of comparative biology -an area which developed out of the need for a synthesis of subdisciplines and data -and discuss the nature of our knowledge of organismic diversity. 592 pages, $35.00 tentative, Spring 1 981 To order send check or money order to Dept.

Ocean Yearbook is intended to fill that gap, acting as an authoritative and impartial source of information and analysis. A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW Presenting an interdisciplinary perspective, each volume will contain The review of the year, a survey of the year's principal legislation, negotiations, scientific discoveries, and other ocean-related events. Articles, collected under separate headings, which in their entirety comprehend major ocean issues. Relevant tabular data and charts are included. Appendices, a series of tables (to be updated annually), reports from institutions, various directories, and other pertinent documents.

Barrett With a Commentary by Howard E. Gruber "Howard E. Gruber and Paul H. Barrett have now sealed the coffin of Darwin's detrac- tors by publishing the so-called 'M and N notebooks.' . . . Darwin kept them primarily in 1938, when he was 29 years old. In them, he recorded his early conviction of evolu- tionary continuity between humans and other animals.... These notebooks display all the features of humanistic intellect that his detractors denied. .... Charles Darwin was reconstructing the world and he knew exactly what he was doing.
