<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daniel 7, Intertextuality, and the History of Israel's Cult Daniel Boyarín University of California, Berkeley Professor Hanan Eshel , in memoriam ■ The Bifurcation of the Interpretive Tradition Ancient and modern readers have offered two basic interpretations of the "[One like a] Son of Man" (p3X "QD) in Dan 7:13. One line of interpretation holds that the One like a Son of Man is a symbol of a collective, namely, the faithful Israelites at the time of the Maccabean revolt.1 The other basic line of interpretation sees the One like a Son of Man as a divine figure of one sort or another, a second God, a son of God, or an archangel.2 The reason for this double interpretation is not hard to find; the text itself, I suggest, is split and doubled on itself. I propose (with other interpreters and scholars) that the vision itself seems almost ineluctably to require that we understand a divine figure. The gloss on the vision in the end of the chapter, or pesher (to which I will return below), on the other hand, seems equally as strongly to interpret the One like a Son of Man as a collective earthly figure, Israel or the righteous of Israel.3 The text is thus, in a profound sense, divided against itself. In 1 For literature supporting this view, see John J. Collins, "The Son of Man and the Saints of the Most High in the Book of Daniel," JBL 93 (1974) 50-66, at 50 n. 2. 2 John A. Emerton, "The Origin of the Son of Man Imagery," JTS 9 (1958) 225-42. 3 Interpreters who do not make the move of recognizing the quilting or felting of the text are, I think, constrained to force either the vision or its interpretation to mean something other than they "naturally" mean, taken at face value. The best attempt to harmonize the two is to be found, I think, in an article by John J. Collins ("Son of Man," 55-58). Arguing from the fit of the prose account of the war of Israel and Antiochus that is found at the end of the book of Daniel, namely, chs. 10-12, to the visionary account given in ch. 7, he suggests that the war on earth was considered as paralleled by a war in heaven. He further supports this position by adducing other parallels from the Bible. He thus suggests that the One like a Son of Man is both an angel (in his view Michael) and a representation of the people of Israel through their guardian at one and the same time. The HTR 105:2 (2012) 139-62</page><page sequence="2">140 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW general, I would suggest as a matter of method and even of theoretical principle that almost always when a commentatorial tradition is as split as this is, we should seek for tension within the text itself, such that both interpretations can be said to be supported by the text.4 The intertextuality of the text, its heteroglossia, precludes any possibility of textual unity. As I shall argue, the text is made of the interweaving of two earlier, independent apocalyptic visions and then the provision of an interpretation, a pesher, for the newly re woven cloth. Rather than seeing levels within the text as authentic and inauthentic, I regard the text of the chapter as the work of its author, the author of Daniel (note that I do not distinguish between authors and redactors), who, nevertheless, as all authors at some level and authors of antiquity more openly than moderns, built the text out of existing literary materials and shaped them to his or her own design and designs. To put this another way, I would suggest that the question of unity or disunity in the text is misplaced. The text is a unity; it has been produced by an author, but it has not been made up out of whole cloth by him or her. As such it incorporates other texts and traditions. Texts are felt or patchwork more than they are warp and weft. In the pesher on the vision, it would certainly seem as if the interpreter takes the One like a Son of Man to be Israel, "the saints of the Most High." The crucial portion of the text in Daniel 7 reads thus: 16 1 approached one of the attendants and sought from him the truth about all this. He spoke to me and made known to me the interpretation of the mat- ters. 17 "As for these great beasts which are four: four kings will arise from the earth. theophanic elements of the vision would now be preserved as being the province of this High Angel. This is owing, in his view, to the statement in Daniel 12 that the just of Israel will join the angelic band at the end of days: "the people shares in the kingdom of the angels, and so the interpretation of 7:27 is merely a spelling out of the human dimension of the more complete reality mentioned in the vision in vs. 22 and in the interpretation in vs. 18" (ibid., 62). The "people of the holy ones" in 7:27 are so called because their king, as it were, is the angel Michael, and because they themselves are or will be angelic: "If the term 'holy ones' in the Book of Daniel contains any reference to the Jewish people, and I believe that at least the phrase 'people of the holy ones' refers to them, it is only in virtue of their association with the 'holy ones,' the angelic host led by Michael, which fights for Israel in heaven" (ibid., 63). Collins's interpretation cannot be proven wrong, and it leads to an entirely different assessment of the chapter and its meanings. To my taste, it leads, however, to a reading too complicated by half: "Accordingly it seems most likely that the figure of the one like the son of man represents the archangel, Michael, who receives the kingdom on behalf of his host of holy ones, but also on behalf of his people Israel" (ibid., 64). It is the awkwardness of that near afterthought, "but also," that points to the difficulty of Collins's attempt to have his cake and eat it too, so to speak. See a similar objection in Louis Francis Hartman and Alexander A. Di Lella, The Book of Daniel (trans. Louis Francis Hartman; AB 23; Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1978) 91 . Furthermore, his reading leaves untouched the difficulty of the mismatch between the Ancient of Days as a divinity and the Son of Man as a symbol, produced out of the conflation of the two source texts. Precisely concealed in that awkward syntax is, in my view, the awkwardness of the chapter itself as produced by its conflation of two texts and two sets of meanings. 4 1 am virtually certain that other readers of the piece will easily think of comparable examples.</page><page sequence="3">DANIEL BOYARIN 141 18 The holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess the kingdom forever and forever and ever."5 There follows further explanation of the fourth beast and its horns and its fate, and its defeat of the holy ones: 22 Until the Ancient of Days came and gave judgment for the holy ones of the Most High and the time came and the holy ones possessed the kingdom. The text then goes back to explain once again the fourth beast as a terrible kingdom with ten kings- and an eleventh king worse than any of them who will set aside three previous kings and try to wear down v. 25) the holy ones of the Most High. He will force them to change their law and their appointed times (Sabbaths and festivals), and he will be permitted to do so for a time, and for two times, and a half a time, until: 26 The court will be seated,6 and his dominion will be taken away, for de- struction and perdition until the end. 27 Kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under all heaven were given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High. Its kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and all of the dominions will serve and obey it. "The people of the holy ones" cannot be other than Israel or its faithful martyrs. I conclude then that from the viewpoint of method two entirely separate issues must not be conflated. The first is the meaning of the One like a Son of Man as interpreted in the pesher and as its meaning is constructed in the quilted apocalypse that joins the two originally separate apocalypses that I shall presently identify. The second is the possible other meanings the figure has when taken out of this context. These meanings can be earlier or later or even synchronic ones, made available via the workings of intertextuality, this intertextuality being signposted in the very roughness of the sewn seams- what Michael Riffaterre refers to as "ungrammatically"- of the existing text.7 It is confusion of these two moments that has led to much of the ink being spilled in vain in the interpretation of this chapter. ■ The Two Apocalypses of Daniel 7 Let us first take a look at the text as we have it in front of us. The text begins with Daniel's vision of the four beasts in 7:2-8: 5 All translations of Daniel are taken from John J. Collins, Daniel: A Commentary on the Book of Daniel (ed. Frank Moore Cross; Minneapolis: Fortress, 1993) unless otherwise noted. 6 There seems to be a corruption here in the text. Hartman and Di Lella give: "But when the court sits in judgment, its dominion [the dominion of the eleventh horn] will be taken away, by final and utter destruction," assuming a very plausible haplography. This interpretation is supported as well by the midrash on Daniel 7 in Rev 13:6-7. 7 Michael Riffaterre, Text Production (trans. Terese Lyons; New York: Columbia University Press, 1983).</page><page sequence="4">142 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW 1 In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and the visions of his head on his bed. Thereupon he wrote down the dream: 2 "I watched and behold, the four winds of heaven stirred up the great sea. 3 Four great beasts came up from the sea, each differing from the other. 4 The first was like a lion but had wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a human being, and a human heart was given to it. 5 Behold, another beast, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. Thus it was told: "Arise, devour much flesh." 6 After this I watched, and behold, another, like a leopard. It had four wings of a bird on its side and the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it. 7 After this I watched, and behold a fourth beast, fearsome and terrible and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth. It ate and crushed and trampled what was left with its feet. It was different from all the other beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. 8 1 considered the horns, and behold, another, little horn emerged in their midst. Three of the former horns were uprooted before it. Behold, there were eyes like human eyes in that horn and a mouth speaking great things. The first beast is like a lion with eagle wings. Its wings are plucked and it is then made to stand on two feet like a human being and given a human heart. The second beast is like a bear with three fangs (or ribs) between its teeth; it is enjoined to devour much flesh. The third beast is like a leopard with four bird wings and four heads and it is given dominion (or a tongue: pbìB in the мт, but the Greek presupposes ]üb). The fourth beast is the most terrifying of all, possessing ten horns; it eats with iron teeth and then crushes and tramples what is left. An eleventh horn emerges, three of the former horns are uprooted, and, "Behold, there were eyes like human eyes in that horn and a mouth speaking great things" (v. 8). 8 8 Without pretending to have any interpretation of this vision in mind, I would observe a few points. Each of the beasts has a numbered set of some anatomical feature that does not belong to it by nature. Each of the beasts is, at least arguably, afforded a human organ in the course of the vision, but this can be seen only if we engage in some necessary emendation. There is at least one piece of credible evidence that the text has been corrupted. As pointed out by H. L. Ginsberg more than a half-century ago ( Studies in Daniel [Texts and Studies of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America 14; New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1948]), the two visions of the eagle and the bear have somehow become conflated or reversed, for it is surely the bear that is made to stand on his hind-legs like a human and not the eagle. If we emend the text accordingly, we will discover that the eagle is given a human heart, the bear is made to stand like a human, the leopard has a human tongue (following the Greek), and the fourth beast has eyes like human eyes and a mouth that speaks. The three fangs, moreover, will appear in the mouth of the lion-eagle who is enjoined to devour much. There is, accordingly, a structural unity to the vision of the four beasts as I have just reconstructed it, following Ginsberg, who has recently been supported by Hartman and Di Lella, who transfer the human heart from the lion-eagle to the bear, thus partly spoiling the plan {Book of Daniel, 209). Although other commentators from Collins to Goldingay have rejected this emendation, I would argue that the present literary considerations support it. See too Ziony Zevit, "The Structure and Individual Elements of Daniel 7," ZAW 80 (1968) 385-86, at 387, who summarily dismisses Ginsberg's suggestions. I am convinced, however, by Ginsberg's argument (although this will not affect my thesis in the present paper at all). Giving each of the</page><page sequence="5">DANIEL BOYARIN 143 We then find the following sequence: 9 1 watched until thrones were set, and an Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was white as snow and his hair like lamb's wool. His throne was flames of fire and its wheels flashing fire. A river of fire flowed and went out from before him. 10 A thousand thousands served him, and a myriad of myriads stood before him. The court was seated and books were opened. 11 I watched then from the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking, I watched until the beast was slain and its body was destroyed and committed to the burning fire. 12 As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, and an extension of life was given to them for a time and a season. 13 I watched in the vision of the night, and behold, one like a human being came with the clouds of heaven, and he approached the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. 14 To him was given dominion and kingdom. All peoples, nations, and languages will serve him. His dominion is an everlast- ing dominion, which will not pass away, and his kingdom is indestructible.9 Now, on the one hand, it has to be observed that a very skillful hand has put this text together, so skillful that biblical scholar Ziony Zevit refers to the "essential unity" of the chapter as "obvious."10 There remain, however, two abrupt changes of scene in these two verses, one that jumps from the description of the speaking horn to the tribunal and then after another two verses one that jumps back even more abruptly to the speaking horn. At least one plausible philological/literary scenario would have it that indeed verses 11-12 originally followed verse 8 (in some pre- text to Daniel 7), which then would have read very smoothly: 8 Behold, there were eyes like human eyes in that horn and a mouth speak- ing great things.11 I watched then from the sound of the great words that beasts something human explains their capacity to rule at all. They are beasts who can imitate a man sufficiently to have authority. This interpretation, dependent as it is on an emendation, is, of course, highly speculative. I offer it in memory of my lamented teacher. 9 Translation following Collins, Daniel , 274-75, but I have restored the emendation. 10 Zevit himself provides the following précis of the plot: "Section two (v. 7-12) begins with a detailed description of the fourth beast and then concentrates on a description of the eleventh horn before which three others are uprooted and which has eyes and a mouth speaking 'big things.' There follows a change of scene to the tribunal, where the throne [sic], judge and attendants are cursorily described, an abrupt change back to the horn talking , and finally, one last scene in which the fourth beast is destroyed, its body burnt, while the first three, stripped of power, have their lives spared for a period of time. The third and final section of the visions consists of one scene in which one 'like a son of man' comes up to the 'ancient of days' and is presented to him." Zevit, "Structure," 388 [emphasis added]. Zevit's account alone, I think, accurate and precise as it is in its description of abruptness and truncatedness, would suggest, in contrast to his own expressed view, a text that is not of one piece. Of course, the definition or understanding of unity and disunity has to be made precise. To be sure, "all of the images in the visions are explained in the interpretations," (ibid., 389) and in that sense the chapter is, as I too would claim, unified, but the unification is achieved by the author's manipulation and incorporation of pre-existing sources (as clearly attested by the literary considerations I shall offer). While Zevit has recognized the use of pre-existing sources in the construction of the pericope, nothing in his discussion indicates an appreciation of the synchronic effects of weaving such disparate sources together.</page><page sequence="6">144 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the horn was speaking, I watched until the beast was slain and its body was destroyed and committed to the burning fire. 12 As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, and an extension of life was given to them for a time and a season.11 While it is the case, as Collins points out,12 that this is a somewhat truncated ending for the vision, it remains compelling to see this as the natural continuation from verse 8, just as, I shall propose, the natural continuation of verses 9-10 is verses 13- 14. 13 Looking now at my second hypothesized source text, we will find an even smoother ride. Attaching verses 9-10 to verses 13-14, we now have: 9 1 watched until thrones were set, and an Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was white as snow and his hair like lamb's wool. His throne was flames of fire and its wheels flashing fire. A river of fire flowed and went out from before him. 10 A thousand thousands served him, and a myriad of myriads stood before him. The court was seated and books were opened. 13 1 watched in the vision of the night, and behold, one like a human being came with the clouds of heaven, and he approached the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. 14 To him was given dominion and kingdom. All peoples, nations, and languages will serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which will not pass away, and his kingdom is indestructible.14 This reconstructed text provides a coherent whole (save only for the lack of a direct sequel for the court scene, but this is no smoother in the current arrangement). Without seeing the appearance of the One like a Son of Man as a direct continuation of the appearance of the Ancient of Days, it is impossible to explain why there is more than one throne (a point of which the rabbis of the midrash were well aware).15 Second, the fact that the One like a Son of Man approaches the Ancient of Days also 11 Translation following Collins, Daniel, 21 A, but I have restored the emendation. 12 Ibid., 280. 13 Martin Noth, "Zur Komposition des Buches Daniel," Theologische Studien und Kritiken 98/99 (1926) 143-63, at 145, 159. Noth deletes v. 8 too (or rather considers it "sekondär") and takes lib as the sequel to 7. If we, as do many scholars, follow the Septuagint and treat lia as a doublet of some kind (perhaps even a very significant doublet), then "I watched until the beast was slain" makes a much more graceful sequel to v. 8. (In fact, it is possible that 11a was constructed by an unskilled revisor concerned for the lack of fit between 10 and lib.) Or, if we follow Noth, once v. 8 was added, then 11a was added to provide a (very awkward) continuity. In any case, this revision would have been quite late, as no Greek text of Daniel reflects it. 14 Translated as in Collins, Daniel , 275; cf. the treatment in Matthew Black, "The Throne- Theophany, Prophetic Commission, and the 'Son of Man' ," in Jews, Greeks, and Christians: Religious Cultures in Late Antiquity; Essays in Honor ofW. D. Davies (ed. Robert G. Hamerton-Kelley and Robin Scroggs; Leiden: Brill, 1976) 57-73, at 60. 15 Interpreters who do not make this connection of the One like a Son of Man as the occupant of the second throne are forced into very weak and forced explanations of the plural "thrones" here: e.g., John Goldingay, Daniel (WBC 30; Dallas, Tex.: Word, 1989) 165.</page><page sequence="7">DANIEL BOYARIN 145 suggests that verse 13 is the natural continuation of verse 10. Thirdly, the text as we have it does not provide a smooth narrative, for after the books are opened, there is no judgment scene condemning the beast to the fire. He is merely thrown in.16 Next, verses 9-10 and verses 1 3-14 are in a poetic style marked by their rhythm, elevated diction, and parallelism, while the narrative of the four beasts and its sequel in verses 11-12 are clearly prose.17 Let me flesh out this claim, for which the original text will be helpful: Пгггз p] фггг?

Noth himself regards v. 14 as the secondary addition of the author of Daniel, a point of which I am less convinced. V. 14 seems to me both necessary and smooth as an original part of the throne vision; indeed, it is in some sense the very point of it. It is, moreover, presupposed by v. 18 and not only by the more elaborate (and perhaps later) version of the pesher. 18 Note the alliteration of the repeated л-sounds in the beginning of several words in this verse, for which see Stanislav Segert, "Aramaic Poetry in the Old Testament: Daniel 2-7," Archiv Orientální 70 (2002) 75. 19 It should be noted that BHS sets precisely these verses as poetry and not as prose, while the entire surrounding context is set as prose. According to Segert ("Aramaic Poetry," 66-67), this judgment was made by Walter Baumgarten already in 1937.</page><page sequence="8">146 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW 9 1 was seeing until thrones were set up and One Ancient of Days sat: His raiment was like white snow II And the hair of his head was like the wool of sheep. His throne was sparks of fire II Its wheels were burning fire. 10 A river of fire flowed and went out from before him. A thousand thousand served him II And a myriad of myriads stood up before him. He sat in judgment and books were opened before him. 11 I was seeing then from the voice of the great words that the horn was speaking. I saw until the beast was killed and his body was destroyed and was put into the fire. 12 And the other animals gave over their reign but an extension of life was given to them for a time. 13 1 was seeing in the vision of the night and behold, With the clouds of heaven One like a Son of Man was coming II And to the Ancient of Days he came II And they brought him close before him. 14 And to him was given sovereignty and glory and kingdom II and all of the peoples and languages will worship him. His reign is an eternal reign which will not pass II And his kingdom will not be destroyed. 15 My soul, I Daniel, was sick in its sheath and my visions of the night pan- icked me. The most prominent poetic sign in the italicized verses is the use of synonymous parallelism, that which can fairly be said to be the form of biblical poetry -whether Hebrew or Aramaic20- and a legacy, of course, from earlier Semitic poetries. Moreover, as shown by Stanislav Segert, these verses also exhibit a rhythmic structure typical of biblical poetry.21 According to Segert's summary, there are myriad poetic features precisely in the italicized verses above and none whatever in the interposing verses.22 The case for the distinction should be considered closed, and the implications for my present argument seem clear as well. This strongly supports the view that two originally separate texts, one prose and one poetry, have been felted together by the author of Daniel 7. Finally, in addition to the narrative infelicities observed when the text is read as is, there is a further ungrammaticality in the literary logic if we consider the One like a Son of Man to be the fifth beast, Israel, and not a divinity. The vision of the four beasts is clearly a symbolic or even allegorical vision; the beasts represent something else, kings or kingdoms, but the Ancient of Days is not an allegorical symbol of any kind- he is undoubtedly God. One would expect that his compatriot, the One like a Son of Man who actually approaches him, would also not be an allegory, but a real persona, also an actual divine entity and not a symbol of something else. 20 Ibid., 68. 21 Ibid., 73. Note that Segert does not use his analysis to further an argument for sources in the text. 22 Ibid., 79.</page><page sequence="9">DANIEL BOYARIN 147 In the present form of the text, constituted as it is with that second figure acting as the counterpart of the animals and the symbol of Israel, we find an allegorical symbol, a vision like one of the four beasts, interacting with a real character, God, the Ancient of Days. This is clearly a sign of a literary mismatch,23 because in the vision of the two thrones and the One like a Son of Man approaching the Ancient of Days, the One like a Son of Man is clearly a member of the heavenly court. I thus believe that Delcor is correct in insisting that "le fils d'Homme est ici un symbole, comme les quatre bêtes, et non un membre de la cour céleste à quelque titre que ce soit. Il s'identifie avec une réalité terrestre au même titre que les quatre bêtes,"24 but only on condition that it be understood that it is to the work of the author of the pesher, seemingly the actual author of Daniel 7 itself, to which the statement applies. And this author has created the mismatch. In the final text, we end up with God speaking with a symbol for Israel and not with a member of the celestial court. Either "the one like a son of man" [s/c] is a mere symbol of some other entity (Israel, as the pesher would have it) or he is an actual member of the heavenly court and thus not a symbol.25 As the text is constituted before us, this is a fatal contradiction in meaning. Finally, a further disjunction is implied in the fact that for the beasts, Daniel says simply that he saw such and such a beast, while here he sees an entity " like a human being." If this were an allegorical picture as the other four are, then why not "I saw a human being"? It follows that Daniel in the original apocalypse saw a real divine entity in the form of a human being and not a picture of a human being standing for something else. I am convinced, therefore, that despite the Ugaritic battle between the sea and the rider on the clouds, pointed to especially by Collins as a decisive blow against the theory of two conjoined apocalypses,26 Martin Noth, who made the proposal of two interwoven sources already in 1926, was essentially on target. Collins himself remarks that "Daniel 7 is not simply a reproduction of an older source, Canaanite or other."27 Given this correct observation, the argument that there could not be two apocalyptic sources for Daniel 7 owing to the alleged presence of both motifs in Ugaritic myth becomes much weaker. It should be emphasized, moreover, that there is not a clear sequence in the Ugaritic epics between Baal's defeat of Yam and his investiture by El as subordinate deity. In KTU 1 .2 IV 32-34, it is Ashtart and Kothar wa-Hasis, Baal's allies (and not El), who declare Baal king of the gods after his defeat of Yam.28 Baal's recognition by El as his legitimate subordinate comes somewhat later in the myth when El permits Baal to build a 23 Collins, Daniel, 305. Collins sees this point clearly but nonetheless does not concede that this mismatch is conducive to a two-source hypothesis. 24 Mathias Delcor, Le livre de Daniel (Sources Bibliques; Paris: Gabalda, 1971) 155. 25 As he is clearly understood in Mark 13:27 as well (personal communication, Richard Hays). 26 John J.

Mark Smith refers to this acquisition of his own palace as "a highly protracted process."29 Moreover, as Collins himself informs us, the Ugaritic texts that seem most clearly to refer to Baal's appointment by El are not in the Baal Epic at all but in other Ugaritic texts and fragments.30 In fact, in my reconstruction of two apocalypses, I think I can descry the outlines at least of a syncresis between two separate mythic motifs in Daniel, Baal's defeat of Yam and Baal's investiture by El as king of the gods and El's virtual successor. Note that both of them would result in the triumph of the junior god, thus explaining their having been conjoined by the author of Daniel as well. In Exodus 15, for example, we see both the defeat by y' of the Sea and his triumphant reign thematized, but this is not the same thing as investiture of the younger god by the elder one. Nonetheless, the compatibility of the two narratives enabled, on my hypothesis, their conflation in Daniel 7.31 1 should note that I do not offer these considerations in support of my analysis of Daniel 7 as the conflation of two apocalypses but rather to raise significant doubt that the Ugaritic evidence militates against it. Whatever the original mythic origins of the two apocalypses in Ugarit or Israel, it seems clear that the author of Daniel had before him two texts in two literary forms, a myth that had been transformed already into a prose political allegory (the four beasts) and a poetic fragment of myth that the author of Daniel sought (largely but not entirely successfully) to so transform through his own literary and then interpretive art. Further evidence that the one with the appearance of a Son of Man is an actual divine figure in at least some of the sources of Daniel can be adduced as well. The one with rather remarkable resemblance to a man is mentioned three more times in Daniel- in 8:15, 10: 16, and 10: 18- although not under the name of One like a Son of Man, but rather, in Hebrew diction "QD ГКПйЭ (8:15 only, "like the appearance of a man"). In the first of these verses, we find the One who appears as a man commanding the angel Gabriel: "And it came to pass, when I, even I, Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. And I heard a man's voice . . . which said, 'Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.' " Once again, we can see that the One like a Son of Man or "with the appearance of a human" is not a mere symbolic or allegorical figure but a divine entity. In addition, the fact that this figure has the authority to command an angel such as Gabriel seems to indicate that he has indeed already received his dominion.32 An allegorical symbol in a vision can hardly be such an active agent. Indeed, it is the son-of-man-like figure who explains the vision. 29 Ibid., 296. 30 Collins, Daniel, 287. 31 Even with Exodus 15, however, it should be mentioned that y' does not kill and defeat the Sea but rather subordinates him to the purposes of y', as the midrash understood well. (I am grateful to Daniel Fisher for helpful conversations on this matter.) See, too, John Day, God's Conflict with the Dragon and the Sea: Echoes of a Canaanite Myth in the Old Testament (University of Cambridge Oriental Publications 35; Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 1985) 165. 32 The point has been made well by Paul Escobar, "The Disciples, the Pharisees, and the</page><page sequence="11">DANIEL BOYARIN 149 The thesis of an originally independent throne vision with two divine figures can also be supported thematically.33 Autopsy of the vision itself argues for the interpretation of the One like a Son of Man as being a holy and heavenly being. In the prophetic book closest to Daniel in spirit and tone, the book of Ezekiel, God is referred to as having human form more than once: at 1:26 an appearance like a human being (D1K ПХ1ЕЭ ГГШ), which is almost word for word our expression in Daniel's Hebrew diction, and again at Ezek 8:2, where the expression is "an appearance like a man" (2ГК ¡ГШ, reading СГХ for мт Ш with Greek and other witnesses), which may, according to some commentators, refer to a separate heavenly being. Furthermore, clouds, as well as riding on or with clouds, are a common concomitant of biblical theophanies.34 J. A. Emerton made the point even more decisively: "The act of coming with clouds suggests a theophany of Yah we himself. If Dan. vii. 13 does not refer to a divine being, then it is the only exception out of about seventy passages in the ОТ."35 1 want to bring Emerton 's point out more explicitly than Emerton did and remark that since every other such incident in the Tanakh refers to an appearance of God, we should read this one too as the revelation of God, a second God, as it were, and not an angel. This is not a human being (or primordial Anthropos )36 but one who looks like a human being, an explicitly anthropomorphic divine figure as in Ezekiel. The implication is, of course, that there are two such divine figures in heaven, an old God, the Ancient of Days, and a young God,37 the One like a Son of Man. Comparing the following description of a basic structure in the Canaanite pantheon, the relation of El to Baal, as described by Frank Cross, will help Multitudes: The Various Audiences of the Son of Man," unpublished paper (Berkeley, Calif., 2009). 33 See too A. Feuillet, "Le fils de l'homme de Daniel et la tradition biblique," RB 60 (1953) 187-89. See, too, Black, "Throne," 61, who concludes properly from Feuillet: "This, in effect, means that Dan. 7 knows of two divinities, the Head of Days and the Son of Man." One of the earliest readers of Daniel 7, the author of the Similitudes of Enoch, certainly reads the two-throne apocalypse independently of the "beasts from the sea" pericope, suggesting either that he saw the exegetical point offered here, or, even more intriguingly, that he was not reading Daniel 7 but rather a source text for Daniel 7. See too Adela Yarbro Collins and John J. Collins, King and Messiah as Son of God: Divine, Human , and Angelic Messianic Figures in Biblical and Related Literature (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 2008) 73. 34 Hartman and Di Lella, Book of Daniel, 101 list Exod 13:21; 19:16; 20:21; Deut 5:22; 1 Kgs 8:10; Sir 45:4. 35 Emerton, "Origin," 231-32. 36 As remarked already, with his usual good judgment, by Erik Sjöberg, Der Menschensohn im ethiopischen Henochbuch (Lund: Gleerup, 1946) 193. Mowinckel, somewhat surprisingly, still adopts the Religionsgeschichte perspective by which the "Son of Man" is the name for the primordial man, whom the so-called gnostics would call Anthropos, and Daniel's "One like a Son of Man" is a secondary defanging of the concept! (Sigmund Olaf Plytt Mowinckel, He That Cometh: The Messiah Concept in the Old Testament and Later Judaism [trans. G. W. Anderson; Oxford: Blackwell, 1956] 372-73). 37 For a study of the ubiquity of this pattern, see Moshe Idei, Ben: Sonship and Jewish Mysticism (Kogod Library of Judaic Studies; London: Continuum, 2007).</page><page sequence="12">150 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW to corroborate the deep connection between this pattern and the most ancient wellsprings of Israel's Canaanite cult: In Akkadian and Amorite religion as also in Canaanite, Ël frequently plays the role of "god of the father," the social deity who governs the tribe or league, often bound to league or king with covenant ties. His characteristic mode of manifestation appears to be the vision or audition, often in dreams. This mode stands in strong contrast to the theophany of the storm god whose voice is the thunder and who goes out to battle riding the cloud chariot . . . Ba l comes near in his shining storm cloud. Ël is the transcendent one.38 The homology between this and our Ancient of Days and One like a Son of Man is striking. This unreconstructed relic of Israel's religious past (if not her present as well) was no doubt disturbing to at least some Jews in antiquity, including, I suppose, the author of Daniel, who forced it to be a representation not of a divinity but of the people of Israel. Other Jews adopted wholeheartedly, or simply inherited, the doubleness of Israel's God, the old Ancient of Days, and the young Rider on the Clouds with the appearance of a human being. The two-throne apocalypse in Daniel calls up a very ancient strand in Israel's religion, one in which, it would seem, the El-like sky-God of justice and the younger Rider on the Clouds, storm- God of war, have not really been fully and successfully merged. ■ What Did the Author Do? The redactional work that joined together the apocalypse of the four beasts and the apocalypse of the two thrones is of an ideological piece with the work of the author of Daniel in adding his pesher.39 According to my hypothesis, the author of Daniel felted these two visions together in order to make possible the demythologizing and historicizing interpretation (pesher) of the newly compounded apocalypse that we find in verses 15-29, while at the same time providing hooks backward to chapter 2 and forward to chapter 8. This felting provides a much more harmonious text, although not, of course, one entirely without discordant notes as well. By splicing the apocalypse of the two thrones into the apocalypse of the four beasts, the author revised completely (but not completely successfully) the theology of the throne vision of two divine figures and turned them into one divine figure and one symbol of a human group, the righteous Jews. To the question of why the author included the throne vision at all only to reduce its theological significance, I would answer that in order to provide a fire to which the fourth beast could be consigned, the author of Daniel inserted the first verses 38 Frank Moore Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1973) 43. 39 This work of his is thus consistent with the work of the Deuteronomists and Prophets, who, according to Adela Yarbro Collins and John Collins, "criticized and qualified" the divinizing royal ideology of ancient Israel {King and Messiah , xi).</page><page sequence="13">DANIEL BOYARIN 151 of the throne apocalypse before finishing the narrative of the four beasts, since these verses of the throne apocalypse provide two elements that he wished for, a judgment (books were opened) and a punishment (the river of fire). Continuing the throne apocalypse after the intruded verses that signal the end of the beast apocalypse enabled the author to reinterpret the One like a Son of Man as well, such that he now is not the counterpart of the Ancient of Days but rather of the beasts, especially the fourth beast. The particle kě ("like") in the case of the One like a Son of Man is quite different in usage than the same particle with respect to the beasts. In the former case it means a real divine entity that has the form of a human being, while in the latter cases it means a vision that appears like a bear, leopard, etc. The morphological coincidence of kě being used in two senses enabled the relatively seamless quilting of the two pieces even though they were semantically very different in the original source texts.40 This set up the combined text as a new apocalypse which enabled a reinterpretation of the One like a Son of Man. Having separated him from his natural place on the second throne as a heavenly being alongside the Ancient of Days, he is brought down to earth, and like the four beasts, read as a human political entity, Israel. Thus the four beasts, whatever they were in the source myth (which is beyond the scope of the present argument), become now the empires of Babylonia, the Medes, Persia, and the most terrible fourth one of Alexander and his descendants, which will, in the end, be defeated by the One like a Son of Man- namely the people of the holy ones on high, faithful Israel- at the successful end of the war against Antiochus. The author of Daniel has made this so by his weaving of a single apocalypse out of two mythic texts, namely, by his transformation of what is essentially a mythical representation into a historical one.41 The very disjunct that I noted before between 40 For the disjunct in the use of kě in the present text between the animals and the One like a Son of Man, see Goldingay ( Daniel , 168), who, nonetheless, comes to quite different conclusions from mine. 41 In this sense I both agree and disagree with Hartman and Di Lella: "Since there is sufficient consensus that kabar 'ěndš, 'one in human likeness' (7:13), is a symbol of qaddíšé c elyônîn , 'the holy ones of the Most High,' the understanding of this much disputed person will not be influenced in any appreciable way by one's hypothesis that there may be two hands at work in the chapter" {Book of Daniel, 85). They are, of course, just right vis-à-vis the interpretation of the book of Daniel, but if my hypothesis of a prior composition incorporated into the book were deemed acceptable, another meaning of the One like a Son of Man may be descried before the text, as it were. This point obviates objections to the notion of the imagery as drawn from Israelite-Canaanite myth, such as the one offered by Zevit, who states: "Writing against the pagan abominations of Antiochus Epiphanes, it is most doubtful that he would have used any imagery that smacked of paganism as a vehicle for the message so clearly set forth in this chapter. If any images were adopted from the non- Je wish world, they must have been neutral ones" ("Structure," 391). This objection is obviated, however, if instead of thinking of adoption we think rather of suppression, and if instead of thinking of non-Jewish - as if "Jewish" comprised a certain kind of severe orthodox monotheism- we think rather of traditional material that is being "neutralized" by its demythologization. We have met the "pagan" and he is us, to misquote Pogo. Notwithstanding the comment of an anonymous reader of this paper, I fail to see how Daniel 8 and 1 1 damage my thesis in any way. Whatever the precise meaning of the attack by the goat on the heavenly host in 8:10 (and in its parallel in ch. 11), it</page><page sequence="14">152 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the Ancient of Days as a real presence and the One like a Son of Man as a symbol is precisely what the author of Daniel desired to achieve in his search for a perfectly "monotheistic" representation. As in any author, but perhaps in his case more than many, the workings of intertextuality have left their mark on the surface of the text, and it is this roughness of the surface that allows multiple interpretations both in traditional reading and in modern scholarly investigation alike. As Carsten Colpe has put it, "[T]he differences between figure and interpretation suggest fragmentation and an alien tradition."42 The "alien" tradition is, however, a tradition from within Israel that has been alienated by the author of Daniel, more like the "alien word" of Bakhtin than like the "alien" of heresiological purity- seeking. The pesher in verses 16-18 makes this, I think, crystal clear: 16 1 drew close to one who was standing there and asked him about all this and he answered and made known to me the explanation [pesher] of the words. 17 These great beasts which are four are four kings that will arise from the earth. 18 And the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and hold the kingdom forever and ever. As Hartman and Di Lella point out, "Moreover,43 the Jews on hearing or reading the apocalypse would surely have been baffled by verses 21-22, 'that horn [= Antiochus IV] waged war against [the angels] and was prevailing against them until the Ancient One arrived'; and by vs. 25, 'He [Antiochus] will utter words against the Most High, and [the angels] he will devastate, planning to change the feast days and the law; they will be handed over to him for a year, two years, and half a year.'"44 If we substitute "Israel" in each bracketed instance of the "angels," the text would be crystal clear to them and to us: "Antiochus did fight against the Jews because of their adherence to the Mosaic Law, and he did abolish the celebration of the Jewish feast days, and the Jews were in his control for some three years (1 Масс 1:41-63; 4:26-66). Thus 'the holy ones of the Most High' must refer to the faithful men, women, and children who were being persecuted by the Seleucid tyrant."45 1 thus conclude with Hartman and Di Lella that in Daniel 7 as we have it before us " 'the one in human likeness' must be a unireferential symbol of only 'the certainly does not seem to imply a second God but only the arrogance of the emperor, for which compare the arrogance of the king of Babylon (as in Isa 14: 12-15) who thinks he can attack the host of heaven itself. The demythologization of the apocalypse is, moreover, carried out even further in the angelic explanation in ch. 8 (see vv. 24b-25: "he will destroy powerful people and his plotting will be directed against holy ones, and deceit will prosper in his hand. He will grow great in his own mind"), just as in ch. 7. 42 Carsten Colpe, "Ho Huios Tou Anthropou," in Theological Dictionary of the New Testament (vol. 8; Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1972) 8:406. 43 1 do not accept their argument to which this is a "moreover": namely, that were the holy ones angels, the book would not comfort those for whom it is intended- that is, the "disenfranchised Jews who were being hounded by Antiochus IV" (Hartman and Di Lella, Book of Daniel, 91), a perfect example of begging the question. 44 Ibid. 45 Ibid., 95.</page><page sequence="15">DANIEL BOYARIN 153 holy ones of the most high,' i.e., the historically recognizable Jews who suffered and died rather than apostatize."46 The author of Daniel has made the One like a Son of Man the analogue of the great stone of Daniel 2 which comes and crushes the four kingdoms symbolized by the four metals in the great statue. Hartman and Di Lella are correct in thus interpreting the book of Daniel, but not so in ignoring the incongruity, the lack of fit, of this view with the older apocalypse embedded in the text itself. The analysis I offer here thus enables both traditional views about the One like a Son of Man to stand: on the one hand, the clearly correct view that the One like a Son of Man as he appears in the vision itself is a divine redeemer figure, and, on the other hand, the equally clearly correct view that the author of the book of Daniel has dethroned and demythologized this figure and turned him into a symbol for the faithful, holy, people of Israel. I believe that I have accomplished three things in the analysis so far. First, I hope I have shown that chapter 7 of Daniel is essentially the work of a single author (with the possible exception of the account of the eleventh horn, which conceivably is the work of a secondary hand) who has shaped traditional mythical materials by combining them into a demythologized historical apocalypse. His work in producing the pesher on this newly produced (by him) apocalypse is consistent with the semantic effect of combining the two pre-existing texts into one and supports it. Second, I hope to have shown how we might now study the pre-existing text itself as diachronic religious evidence, notwithstanding the very effort of the author of Daniel to demythologize it, to dethrone the young God with the appearance of a Son of Man and turn him into a mere symbol of the people of Israel. Third, we can now see more clearly how synchronically the text makes itself available to be read in the fashion that it was in the Similitudes of Enoch and the Gospels as producing a second divine figure, the Son of Man, in heaven together with the Ancient of Days. Diachronic production of the text out of its sources produces intertextuality on the synchronic surface. Source criticism is about the history of the text. Intertextuality is about the text as a synchronic structure. This is a point frequently glossed over in biblical-studies usage of the term intertextuality as if it simply were a fancy word for source criticism. An analogy might help. In Rome, one wanders upon the surface of the ground, but everywhere there are fragments of older strata of the city woven into the fabric of the modern city. When I taught there recently, the office I had at the Gregorian University was in a building, one wall of which was from the time of the Empire, one wall medieval, and two walls from the eighteenth century. Phenomena such as this occur all over the Eternal City. One can discern the lineaments of an older city, of older cities, right on the surface; one does not need to be an archaeologist to see it. The diachronic situation of having been built in several periods is replicated in the synchronic appearance of the building and the city. This is how I conceive of 46 Ibid., 92. This could make Daniel the earliest text, I believe, in which "holy ones" is used to mean "martyrs," a most frequent usage in later Hebrew, of course.</page><page sequence="16">154 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the biblical text; older religious materials, and indeed, texts, have been woven into the fabric of the current text, but in their own right and in the very marks of the weaving, and one does not have to be a philologist to perceive this. Not only we modern scholars but earlier readers of many generations could discern the older forms, and for many Jews, these were very appealing. Just as the builders of the medieval building in Rome incorporated a still-standing Roman wall into their building, and then the modern builders incorporated that Roman wall and the still sound medieval wall into theirs, new religious texts and concepts could be produced out of old ones, sometimes coming very close to those most ancient strata of all.47 Thus the later Jewish religious notion of a dual (or binitarian) Godhead reproduces (but not uncannily) one of the most ancient strata of biblical (or even pre-biblical) myth in Israel. The point of this analogy, which may well seem commonplace to biblical scholars, is to emphasize the diachronic matter of sources and the synchronic matter of interpretations at one and the same time. It is no accident that Freud chose Rome as his analogue for the unconscious and not Jerusalem, for example. It is precisely the ways that Rome wears its history on its surface that present it for these hermeneutical moments. The analysis presented in this paper enables us to go both backward and forward in time, back to the most ancient sources of Israelite cult and forward to its manifestations in the forms of Judaism found in Enoch and the Gospels. ■ Israel's Second God: Interpreting the Two-Throne Apocalypse Concluding, then, that the pesher written by the author of Daniel asserts that the One like a Son of Man is a representation of the holy ones of Israel during the Maccabean revolt, one can nevertheless inquire separately into the meaning of the figure in the vision text, notwithstanding its present context, which is what I shall propose to do next. For all his success in reweaving, the author of Daniel has still left indices of the patchwork on the surface of the text, making the "older" or "more original" meaning of the throne apocalypse and the figure of the One like a Son of Man available for interpretation as a divine figure. For the rest of this paper, I want to concentrate on interpreting the hypothesized pre-text, the apocalypse of the two thrones. Taking the two-throne vision out of the context of Daniel 7 as a whole, we find several crucial elements: 1) there are two thrones;48 2) there are two divine figures, one apparently old and one apparently young; 3) the young figure is to be the redeemer and eternal ruler of the world. It would certainly not be wrong to suggest, I think, that even if the actual notion of 47 I first developed this notion of older forms of Israelite religion as present on the surface of the biblical text in "The Sea Resists: Midrash and the (Psycho)Dynamics of Intertextuality," Poetics Today 10 (1989) 661-77, later incorporated into Boyarín, Intertextuality and the Reading of Midrash (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990). I am grateful to my colleague Ronald Hendel for reminding me of these publications and rescuing me from some potentially very embarrassing formulations. 48 After the rabbis, I have found that only Mowinckel {He That Cometh , 352) emphasizes this point sufficiently, but, of course, since the literature is massive, I have almost certainly missed others.</page><page sequence="17">DANIEL BOYARIN 155 messiah is not yet present here, the notion of a divinely appointed divine king over earth is, and that this has great potential for understanding the development of the messiah notion in later Judaism (including Christianity). The second-God redeemer figure thus comes, in my view (a view that is, of course, not new but very controversial), out of the earlier history of Israel's religion. Goldingay writes: For the anointed one to be a heavenly figure would be a novel idea; by definition, the anointed one is an earthly descendant of David. The visionary portrayal of him coming with the clouds of the heavens might simply signify that he comes by God's initiative and as his gift, without suggesting that he is in himself other than human. . . . Nevertheless, if the humanlike figure is the anointed, the anointed as Daniel pictures him now has a very transcendent dimension. If the idea of the anointed moves between a God pole and a hu- man pole, this humanlike figure is at the former.49 The One like a Son of Man, Goldingay 's "humanlike figure," is thus, as he argues, clearly a divine figure, who, as messiah, necessarily will have both a human and a divine pole. I want to sharpen Goldingay 's point further. We cannot see this coming with the clouds of heaven as a "gift" to a human, for then he would not be One like a Son of Man, but simply a son of man. In the simile lies the divinity; the deutero s theos is in the detail. Rather than, however, seeing the divinity of the redeemer king as a novel idea, I would suggest that it is, in fact, one of the oldest of the elements of this vision and one that would have a very lively future life. As Carsten Colpe has written with characteristic clarity of argument: "The figure of the Son of Man undoubtedly attracted to itself the attributes of Yah weh, e.g., riding on the clouds .... Such traits could be transferred to an eschatological Son of Man only if He was a heavenly being and not a mere earthly messiah."50 Where I part company with Colpe is in his statement that these traits "point directly to an origin of the concept outside the tradition of Israel." There is very little warrant for this statement, if any; there is no reason to consider this concept as anything but a part of the inheritance of ancient Israel together with the other Canaanite tribes and groups.51 Following the argument made originally by Emerton, Collins has helpfully summed up the main points of comparison with Canaanite (Ugaritic) representations. As he argues, "What is important is the pattern of relationships,"52 namely, the fact that in Daniel there are two godlike figures, one old and one young; the younger 49 Goldingay, Daniel , 170. 50 Colpe, "Ho Huios," 406. 51 See the statement of Smith: "The biblical evidence pertaining to the asherah does not sustain a historical dichotomy between 'normative Yahwism' over and against 'Canaanite religion' or a 'popular religion' tainted by Canaanite influence." Mark S. Smith, The Early History of God: Yahweh and the Other Deities in Ancient Israel (2d ed.; The Biblical Resource Series; Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 2002) 110. 52 Collins, Daniel , 291 .</page><page sequence="18">156 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW one comes riding on the clouds, and he receives everlasting dominion.53 Colpe has noted that "the mythographical similarity between the relation of the Ancient of Days and Son of Man on the one side and that of El and Baal on the other ... fits into the broader conclusion that older material lives on in the tradition of Israel and Judah."54 Those interpretations- and they are legion- that take even the most compelling parallel between the narrative in Daniel and the narrative of El and Baal from Ugarit as evidence of actual literary influence are thus, in my humble view, mistaken. Finally, and continuing this line of thought, it is a mistake to think of Israelite cult as ever being a uniform and fixed thing; it is not that there was a cult of El and y' that was later replaced by a cult of y' alone, but rather that different strands of Canaanite cult, broader strands such as the El cult and more narrowly focused ones such as the Y'cult, became related and conflated in different ways at different times and places.55 It is, therefore, counterintuitive for me to imagine a religious scenario in which y' was broadly understood as a God subordinate to El until the Deuteronomic reforms, as held by Otto Eissfeldt, except for the very earliest stages of the cult of Israel.56 There are, to be sure, in accordance with the notion expressed in the last paragraph, some remarkable texts in the Hebrew Bible that do seem to represent survivals of this very archaic stage. The clearest example of a biblical text in which y' is a son or subordinate of El is Deut 32:8-9: òinfr чза лзовЬ п'вд лЪпз nix ча 1тпэга спэ ]i4Ípi? Ьпщ 8 :inbm bin npir iar mír pbn чэ 9 When Elyon established the nations, when he separated humans from each other, he set the borders of the nations according to the number of the sons of El. For the portion of y' is his nation, and Jacob the allotment of his in- heritance. As given, the verse certainly seems to indicate that y' is one of the sons of Elyon or El, the one of the sons who has been afforded Israel as his particular lot and inheritance. The translation of verse 8 follows the Septuagint and other ancient witnesses including two Qumran mss, while the Masoretic Text has undermined the explosive potential of this verse by emending "sons of ЕГ to read "children of 53 I have modified Collins 's original list of such patterns in two ways. I have dropped the comparison with the sea, since I believe that the sea vision and the Son of Man vision were once two separate elements, and I have emphasized the differential ages of the two divine figures, which seems to me crucial for understanding the pattern of relationships here. 54 Colpe, "Ho Huios," 419. 55 Smith, Early History of God, 7-8. 56 Otto Eissfeldt, "El and Yahweh," JSS 1 (1956) 25-37.</page><page sequence="19">DANIEL BOYARIN 157 Israel," which makes little sense.57 Apart from this and some other possible cognate texts in the Bible,58 we find only Y ' as the supreme God of Israel. As Mowinckel already realized and Cross ratified, Baal as intermediary between humans and El parallels the functions of the Angel of the Lord in the biblical texts.59 It is no wonder, then, that this Angel is conflated and ambiguously identified with y' himself in many biblical texts, and no "outside" influence whatever need be posited. For the merging of El and y' , nothing could be more eloquent than Exod 6:3: "And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as El Shaddai, but my name, y',I did not make known to them." The ancient southern theophanies of Y ', especially at Sinai and the Sea, are (as shown by Cross) too Baal-like for us to see Baal as a later incursion (dressed up as Y ', as it were) into the divine economy of Israel. My best guess on this is that El was the general Canaanite high divinity while y' was the Baal-like divinity of a small group of southern Canaanites, the Hebrews, with El a very distant absence for these Hebrews. When the groups merged and emerged as Israel,60 y', the Israelite version of Baal, became assimilated to El as the high God and their attributes largely merged into one doubled God, with El receiving his warlike, storm-god characteristics from y'.61 Thus, to restate the point, the ancient El and y'- a southern Hebrew equivalent in function (within the paradigm of relations between El and a young warrior-god) to the northern Baal62- merged at some point in Israelite-Canaanite history and apparently quite early.63 1 would suggest- and 57 Jeffrey H.

Smith, God in Translation: Cross-Cultural Recognition of Deities in the Biblical World (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 2008) 193-216. Smith has a long and detailed discussion on the Deut 32:8 issue. 58 Another text that possibly exhibits a fragment of a survival of this very ancient Israelite religious notion of a council of El of which y' is a member is Psalm 82, although the interpretation of this psalm is obscure. For an excellent (save only a certain apologetic Tendenz ) discussion of these two texts, see Michael S. Heiser, "Deuteronomy 32:8 and the Sons of God," Bibliotheca Sacra 158 (2001) 52-1 A, and see other earlier literature cited there, y' is not mentioned in the psalm at all, as we have it according to the Masoretic Text, but there are important witnesses that read y' for Elohim. Pace ibid., n. 36, this variation makes an enormous difference in interpreting the psalm, to the point where one might suggest that the reading Elohim represents another masoretic attempt to reduce the theologically explosive potential of the text. If I am not mistaken, other references to the Divine Council in the Hebrew Bible have y' at its head, thus representing precisely the merger of y' into El that I posit in this article. 59 Cross, Canaanite Myth , 180. 60 Ronald Hendel, Remembering Abraham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005) 57-75. 61 Cross, Canaanite Myth , 58.

Cross, in contrast, argues that y' was originally a cultic name for El used in the south and this usage eventually split off from, and then ousted, El ( Canaanite Myth , 71).

El and y' had very different and in some ways antithetical functions, and this dysfunctionality, I propose, left a residue in which some of the characteristics of the young divinity always had the potential to split off again in a hypostasis (or even separate god) of their own.64 This tension and resultant splitting manifests itself in the traditions behind the Daniel 7 theophany, where we see a new young one, nameless, it would seem,65 at least until he comes to be called Jesus- or Enoch.66 As a much later rabbinic poetic text would have it, y' is: "ancient on the day of judgment and a youth on the day of battle." This event, if indeed there ever was one like it, must have happened very early on, as it is constitutive of Israel itself 67 This "merger," if you will, leaves its marks right on the surface of the text, where the EI-y' combination can still be detected in the tensions and doublings of the biblical text, available to be resurrected, as it were, by astute readers of a certain cast of religious mind as a second, young God, or as a part of God, or divine person within God (and all of these options have been adopted by perfectly "orthodox," non-Christian Jewish theologians as well as by Christians68). Some of the ancient (and modern) readers noting one stratum and ideological line in the text protest that that is the valid one, while others claim the opposite. this question. In a later chapter of his book, Cross treats the close affinities between Baal and y' which are so close, indeed, that as my teacher H. L. Ginsberg realized already in the thirties of the last century, an entire Baal hymn has been lifted intact and adapted for y' in Psalm 29. As Cross emphasizes, this could hardly have been done if the imagery were not appropriate already for y' (ibid., 156). Cross therefore writes, "The language of theophany in early Israel was primarily language drawn from the theophany of Ba'l" (ibid., 157), a formulation that I would slightly modify to read: the language of the theophany of y' in ancient Israel was parallel (even nearly identical) to the language of Baal's theophanies among northern Canaanites. Cross, of course, recognizes the merger here but it is less clear why EI/y' should have absorbed Baal's characteristics that seemingly did not exist before in Israel's religion. As Cross's reconstruction seems not to recognize y' as a variant of Baal, where would he come from? This difficulty is obviated if we assume an ancient cult of El as the universal old God of all of the Canaanites and Baal and y' as variant forms and names of the young God, with y' merged into El in the later forms of official biblical religion. Of course, I do not imagine for one moment that y' did not further appropriate characteristics of Baal as he moved northward and became more of a rain- and storm-god in addition to the mountain- and volcano-god that he had been in his putative original southern home. See also Peter Hay man, "Monotheism- A Misused Word in Jewish Studies?" JJS 42 ( 1 99 1 ) 5. 64 A similar explanation, mutatis mutandis, might help to understand the place of hokmâ and her connections with Asherah, on which see Smith, Early History of God, 133, and sources cited there. 65 It is here that I part company most decisively with Eissfeldt, "El and Yahweh" and Margaret Barker, The Great Angel: A Study of Israel's Second God (London: SPCK, 1992). 66 Another possible hypothesis would be that these traditions are a direct continuation of such survivals as Deut 32:8. I find this less plausible than my explanation offered in the body of the text, but it would be hard to prove. In any case, what is clear enough in Daniel and presumably in whatever traditions lie behind it is that the Ancient of Days is y' and not an Elyon separate from and superior to y' 67 Cross, Canaanite Myth , 186. 68 Daniel Abrams, "The Boundaries of Divine Ontology: The Inclusion and Exclusion of Metatron in the Godhead," HTR 87 (1994) 291-321 .</page><page sequence="21">DANIEL BOYARIN 159 We find in Aphrahat, the Iranian Father of the Church, the following attack on an interpretation (presumably Jewish) that makes the One like a Son of Man out to be the people of Israel:69 "Have the children of Israel received the kingdom of the Most High? God forbid. Or has that people come on the clouds of heaven?" С Demonstration 5.21). While the first point is, of course, merely polemical (as the "God forbid" makes clear), the second is exegetical and to the point.70 On the other hand, the Jews could clearly have retorted: "Is a divine redeemer subject to oppression by a Seleucid king who forces him (the divine redeemer) to abandon his holy days and his law for three and a half years? The Son of Man must be the children of Israel!" Our job as scholars is to take neither of these two positions but to note the surface remains in the text that give rise to such a bifurcated interpretive tradition in which everyone is right. The difference between traditional and modern readings of the text is that we try to see both sides of this unresolved tension in the text and thus make sense of both faces of Janus. Traditional readers did not look at the text and find a patchwork of different texts from different periods; they fixed on one or another of the meaning-strands and said: this is what the text means. In other words, I am suggesting that the reading of the two-throne apocalypse as signaling a double divinity and a transfer of sovereignty from an older to a younger God is a distinct synchronic hermeneutic option. Many Jews in antiquity, including Jesus and his community, as well as the new communities that he has engendered, insisted that the Son of Man is a name for the divine-human redeemer.71 Other Jews, then, and most Jews since late antiquity, insisted no: the One like a Son of Man is Israel, and there is no figure called "the Son of Man." The unresolved tension in Daniel 7 is what gives rise to the legitimately two-faced interpretive tradition about the meaning of the chapter and especially the crucial term, so fateful for the history of religion, "the Son of Man." The pesher insists that the One like a Son of Man is a collective, not an individual and certainly not a divine individual but the saints of the Most High. These saints, for the pesher, are almost doubtlessly the Maccabean heroes who redeemed the temple after a time, two times, and a half time (three and a half years, the actual historical time of the temple's desecration), and to whom dominion has been given. The author of Daniel, in writing this pesher into the text, has accomplished two purposes for his own time: he has discredited the appearance of a second divine 69 Thus predating by centuries Ibn Ezra's collective interpretation, pace Collins, Daniel , 87, who writes that that 12th-century rabbi was the first to interpret it thus. 70 Pace Collins, 308 n. 271, who believes that it is a mere reductio ad absurdum. I would also surmise that there had been a Jewish interpretation prior to Aphrahat that saw the Son of Man as a representation of the collective, Israel. 71 In another article (Daniel Boyarin, "How Enoch Can Teach Us about Jesus," Early Christianity 2 [201 1] 51-76), I have tried to show that the Parables of Enoch demonstrate another independent Jewish group's reading of Daniel in a way that is similar (but different, too) to that of the Jewish groups involved with Jesus.</page><page sequence="22">160 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW figure in the text (or at least, he thinks he has), and he has inscribed his own heroes, the Maccabees, who will issue in the Hasmonean dynasty as the legitimate, heroic, angelic, and divinely ordained rulers of Israel. Note 7:22: "until the Ancient of Days came and provided the holy ones of the Most High and the time arrived and the holy ones held the kingdom." After these holy ones suffer for three and one-half years under the dominion of the arrogant Seleucid, then: 26 Justice will be given and the dominion will pass to destroy and desolate completely. 27 And the kingdom and the dominion and greatness of the king- doms under all of the heaven is given to the people of the most holy ones; their kingdom is an eternal kingdom and all of the rulers will be subservient and obedient to them. Voilà: demythologization, historicization, and Maccabean propaganda, all in one fell swoop. It should further be at least adumbrated that such "reforming" movements leading, inter alia, to absolute centralization of the cult as well as suppression of widespread religious tendencies are usually the province of dominant classes with highly hierarchical structures, the Josianic and Maccabean reforms both being examples of this phenomenon in Israel.72 On my reading, the young God in the original mythic text in Daniel is the figure who will redeem Israel and the world and not an exalted Davidic king.73 There is, as I have argued, nothing in this vision that suggests or even allows seeing the One like a Son of Man as an actual human being. Setting aside the pesher and just looking at the original vision, we do find already, however, that this divine figure, whether messiah or not, will be given "the dominion, the glory, the kingdom and all of the peoples, nations, and languages will worship him, and his dominion will be eternal dominion which will not pass and his kingdom which will not be destroyed" (v. 14). This mythic pattern of second God as redeemer will be crucial, of course, in interpreting the Gospels and the pattern of religion proclaimed there. We will have to try to understand better the relationship of this divine redeemer to the human redeemer, the Davidic messiah. Without subscribing to views that too specifically identify the second God with Baal or y' or even Marduk, I would assert that the general outlines of a myth of a young God subordinated to an old God are enacted in the sources of the throne vision of Daniel 7 , however much the author of Daniel seeks to suppress this myth . In place of notions of El and Y ' as the two Gods of Israel, I would suggest that the pattern of an older God and a younger one, a God of wise judgment and a God of war and punishment, have been transferred from older forms of Israelite-Canaanite religion to new forms in which the older God, whose supremacy is not in question, is now entirely named by the Tetragrammaton, while the functions of the younger God have been, in part, taken by supreme angels or other sorts of divine beings, 72 1 am grateful to Daniel Fisher for reminding me of this point. 73 Pace Barker, Great Angel, 40. 1 thus agree with Emerton's conclusion that "the language used of the Son of man suggests Yah we, not the Davidic king" ("Origin," 231).</page><page sequence="23">DANIEL BOYARIN 161 redeemer figures- at least in the "official" religion of the biblical text. There is not the slightest reason, however, to imagine that the bulk of the "people of the land" had ever accepted this form of official monotheism. Once y' absorbs El, the younger God has no name of his own but presumably is identified at different times with the archangels or other versions of the Great Angel, Michael, as well as with Enoch, Christ, and later on Metatron as well. Some of his ancient guises, especially "the Little Yahu,Yahoel" (!), indicate his ancient (extra- biblical) identity as y' .74 It is the power of that myth itself on its own that explains the continuing life of Jewish binitarianism into Christian Judaism and that is vitally present in non-Christian Judaism as well. There are thus two legacies left us by Daniel 7: it is the ultimate source of "Son of Man" terminology for a heavenly redeemer figure and it is also the best evidence we have for the continuation of a very ancient binitarian (or even ditheistic) Israelite theology deep into the Second Temple period. Although these are separate in Daniel (since there is there no figure called the Son of Man), it is the not-entirely-successful suppression of this myth in Daniel- and thus its strong association with the "One like a Son of Man"- that will explain the later development of the Son of Man as a title in both the Similitudes of Enoch , as well as in the Gospels. While all this is, as I have said, of little significance for the interpretation of the Book of Daniel, for which it is clear that the One like a Son of Man is Israel, or more precisely the Maccabean martyrs, the intertextuality of it all is of the utmost importance for the history of Israel's religion. The bottom line, I think, is that when interpreting the book qua book, we must take it on the terms of its final redaction, but that does not prevent us from paying attention- indeed for a historical perspective, it is necessary to pay attention- to other meanings that various components of the text might have had on their own.75 Better put, perhaps, we must pay attention to the way that these various components do not quite fit together, for it is the cracks and seams that enable the productivity of the text in its future incarnations. The recognition of the separateness of the vision 74 "Yahoel" appears in the Apocalypse of Abraham (70-150 C.E.), but then as late as 3 Enoch (4th- 5th c. C.E.) we find "Yahoel Yah" and "Yahoel" explicitly given as names for Metatron (Andrei Orlov, "Praxis of the Voice: The Divine Name Traditions in the Apocalypse of Abraham," JBL 127 [2008] 53-70 and Philip S. Alexander, "The Historical Setting of the Hebrew Book of Enoch," JJS 28 [1977] 163-64). See also in this context Gedaliahu G. Stroumsa, "Form[s] of God: Some Notes on Metatron and Christ; For Shlomo Pines," HTR 763 (1983) 269-88. As Alexander points out in his article, these very names are predicated in other contemporary texts of God himself. The lines between exalted "angels" and gods get harder and harder to draw and see. Cf. Emerton, "Origin," 242: "At some stage, the old myth was reinterpreted in terms of the supremacy of Yahwe, who had been identified with both Elyon and Baal. Then the Son of man was degraded to the status of an angel, even though he retained the imagery which was so closely attached to him in tradition. This would help to explain the attribution of an exalted status to such beings as Michael and Metatron in later Judaism." 75 This is the precise contrary of the position taken by Mowinckel, He That Cometh , 353, who argues that the "Son of Man" was a pre-existing messianic title derived from the primordial man ( Anthropos ) concept that was transformed by the author of Daniel into a figure for the people of Israel. See also ibid., 420-37.</page><page sequence="24">162 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW of the two thrones from its context allows us to look both at the possible history of such a religious vision and at its possible consequences for an understanding of later movements within the religion. It thus has a diachronic dimension, but it also has a synchronic dimension, in that it explains why later interpretive-religious strands within the religion have read the text as they have. Part of the reason for the conflict and debate among scholars is that while seeming to answer the same question, in truth, they have been asking (and thus answering) very different questions. One question is the meaning of the phrase One like a Son of Man and its usage within chapter 7 of Daniel; quite another question would be what other meanings the text might have both before its incorporation in the book of Daniel and in its afterlife.76 1 would take it as a bit of very precious evidence- all the more so as it is against the grain of biblical theology itself- for the continued vitality of worship of an old and a young God in Israel. This argument follows the form of the Collinses' own in another closely related context: "The fact that the dominant attitude in biblical tradition insists on a sharp distinction between divinity and humanity, and is sharply critical of kingship makes the preservation of the royal psalms all the more remarkable. It requires that we take them seriously as a witness to preexilic religion, before it was chastened by the harsh historical experiences that led to the demise of the monarchy."77 Ditto, I would say, for Daniel and the tradition of the Rider on the Clouds as a second divine figure (or perhaps it would be more precise to say, given my considerations above, for the Ancient of Days as a second divine figure). The historical ties of that pattern of religion to later forms of Judaism, including both rabbinic Judaism and Christianity, are thus clarified if my reconstruction bears weight. Where John Collins seems to consider the pattern of religion enshrined in the throne vision as a frozen relic from Israel's past (or even a foreign past),78 I would see it as very much a living part of Israel's religion both before and long after, explaining both the form of Judaism we call Christianity and also much in non-Christian later Judaism as well.79 76 The failure to make this distinction leads scholars as distinguished as Black ("Throne," 61-62) into confusion, as it has led many others (on both sides of the hermeneutical divide), many of them mentioned by Black. 77 Collins and Collins, King and Messiah , 24. 78 "It has been argued that motifs should not be 'torn out of their living contexts' but 'should be considered against the totality of the phenomenological conception of the works in which such correspondences occur.' Such demands are justified when the intention is to compare the 'pattern of religion' in a myth and a biblical text, but this has never been the issue in the discussion of Daniel 7" (Collins, Daniel , 281). 79 See Daniel Boyarin, "Beyond Judaisms: Metatron and the Divine Polymorphy of Ancient Judaism," Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman Periods 41 (2010) 323-65.</page></plain_text>
