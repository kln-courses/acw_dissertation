Pekelis maintained that the time had come to develop a "jurisprudence of welfare." Recognizing that judges have much more freedom than the myth allows them— freedom, that is, to make law and to fashion remedies for purported grievances—he asked "freedom for what?" His was a "call for the growth of systematic participation of the judiciary ... in the travail of society." Welfare, admittedly, is an ambiguous concept, but to Pekelis it assumed "as its end the ethical and political doctrine professed by our society and attempts to find in the arsenals of judicial doctrine and social science the means for their realization." Welfare jurisprudence is the rejection of "an issueless life and an issueless jurisprudence." 1 * This manuscript was completed in December 1975; except for some citations, it has not been updated. I am therefore not taking into consideration such works as Berger, Government by Judiciary (1977) or Glazer, "Should Judges Administer Social Services?" Public Interest, no. 50, (Winter 1978), p. 64. Analysis of those and other offerings about the question of "judicial activism" must await another time and another forum. 333</page><page sequence="2">334 ARTHUR S. MILLER There is no way of knowing how many lawyers and judges read or were otherwise influenced by Pekelis's views. Even so, it is now obvious that he presciently forecast what in fact has taken place since then: judges, most of all Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States but also on other federal and state courts, have indeed become deeply immersed in the travail of society; they are "activist" as never before in American history. Consider these examples: Item: In December 1975 federal district Judge W. Arthur Garrity placed a Boston high school in "receivership" because of non compliance with integration orders, appointed a receiver, and took over administration of the school.2 Item: In January 1976 Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr., declared that Alabama's prison system amounted to cruel and unusual punish ment contrary to the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution and directed that forty-four guidelines designed to rectify prison conditions be followed. He also created a citizens' review board to monitor compliance and report to the court. Finally, Judge Johnson warned state officials that they could be held personally liable for monetary damages if they failed to comply.3 Item: In 1973 the Supreme Court, speaking through Justice Harry Blackmun—a Nixon "strict constructionist"—wrote the most sweep ing Supreme Court opinion in recent memory in knocking down state abortion laws and establishing a trimester system when a state may regulate the woman's choice to have an abortion.4 Item: Beginning in 1962, with the decision in Baker v. Can, federal courts have consistently either invalidated legislative reapportion ments or, of more importance, told the state legislatures to reapportion under pain of having the judges do it for them.5 Item: In 1966 the Supreme Court, in Miranda v. Arizona, promul gated a little code of criminal procedure concerning what police officers must do while interrogating criminal suspects.6 Item: In Perez v. United States, the Court in 1971 held that purely local loansharking was reachable by Congress through the interstate commerce clause because loansharking was a national problem.7 Other examples could be given, but heeding William of Occam, one need not needlessly multiply them to make the point: the judiciary has indeed become an active participant in social affairs.</page><page sequence="3">Judicial Activism 335 An "affirmative jurisprudence" is being created, complementary to the programs of the Positive State.8 Not all judges so act, to be sure, but enough of them do in areas of social turmoil to make them the target of heavy attack—some of which comes from venal politicians or other know-nothings but some of which issues from a group of academics widely called "neoconservatives." 9 The fulminations of the know-nothings and opportunistic politicians can be dismissed as transient excrescences on the body politic; but the neoconservatives are worth serious attention. My purpose here is to analyze the new judicial activism in the light of the criticisms of neoconservatives, using Professor Nathan Glazer's provocative article in the Fall 1975 issue of The Public Interest as a point of departure.10 Glazer maintains inter alia that the Supreme Court "is engaged in a damaging and unconstitutional revolution"; that "the courts truly have changed their role in American life"; they "now reach into the lives of the people, against the will of the people, deeper than they ever have in American history"; the courts are "authoritarian" and "a free people feels itself increasingly under the arbitrary rule of unreachable authorities"; this, Glazer, asserts, "cannot be good for the future of the state." Were such statements accurate, that would be a sweeping and damning indictment. Glazer raises important questions about the nature of an activist judiciary in the American constitutional order, but his assertions should be taken as just that—a statement of the questions rather than answers to complex problems. There is another dimension to the general question of judicial activism that was slighted in Glazer's exposition. In this essay, the contours of that differing perspective are suggested. What follows develops the following themes: (1) The judiciary, speaking generally, has always been activist; this is particularly true of the Supreme Court. (2) There are, however, new twists on judicial activism in recent decades, in ways that in some respect go even further than Professor Glazer's criticisms. (3) Contrary to Glazer, an activist judiciary may well be the final, even desperate hope of a crumbling system of American constitutionalism to save itself from its own inconsistencies and inequities; in other words, those who are triggering the courts, for after all judges are not self starters, are, as the slogan of several years ago goes, "working within the system." Like Ralph Nader and his efforts to create a</page><page sequence="4">336 ARTHUR S. MILLER competitive enterprise system, the litigants believe the rhetoric of American "democracy" and act accordingly. (4) Even so, despite superficial evidence to the contrary, the judges cannot and will not prevail in the ultimate resolution of the human disputes that characterize and at times disrupt American society. Constitutionalism, Professor Daniel Bell (another neoconserva tive) tells us, may be defined as "the common respect for the framework of law, and the acceptance of outcomes under due process." 11 One need only consult Charles Howard Mcllwain's text on constitutionalism to learn that other definitions exist; 12 but Bell's definition is accepted for purposes of the present essay. Major attention will be accorded the Supreme Court, but federal judges in general will also be scrutinized. SOME BACKGROUND OBSERVATIONS A beginning may be made with a sociological truism. The functioning of a state and its legal system are closely intertwined; a legal system, including the judiciary, does not operate in a political vacuum. Although truistic, these facts tend to become obscured, submerged in a bog of mythology about the nature of law and lawyers and legal systems. The prevailing ideology of American lawyers is "legalism"—the notion that law is a discrete entity in some way separate from the society which it helps to regulate and control. This means that the orthodox model of judicial decision making is that of Blackstone. Judges find but do not make the law; they are limited by the nature of the adversary system to facts brought forth by opposing counsel plus "strict" judicial notice; they are impartial; and they are competent to deal with complex issues.13 The orthodoxy has long been under attack, and is not accepted by the cognoscenti. Nevertheless, a curious ambivalence in legal thought makes knowledgeable observers uneasy about publishing the shortcomings of the Blackstone model. Hence the pretense, as revealed in the standard texts used in law school classes in constitutional law, still is that constitutional decisions are babies brought by judicial storks.14 Some go even further and argue that of course the orthodoxy is faulty but those shortcomings should be kept from the laity, else the symbolic position of the Supreme Court will be badly shaken and its place in the constitutional order</page><page sequence="5">Judicial Activism 337 jeopardized.15 One consequence of this mindset, a part of the legal profession's ideology, is that thousands of law students sally forth each year armed with J.D. degrees and some facility with legal jargon, but with little understanding of law as an instrument of social control or of its relationships to the sciences, social and behavioral and natural. The judiciary, furthermore, is not a "democratic" institution. Not only do federal judges have lifetime appointments, removable under the Constitution only by the extraordinary means of impeachment, but Supreme Court Justices are accountable to no one—only to the Constitution and their consciences, as Chief Justice Earl Warren said in his valedictory speech—for their decisions.16 An essentially oligarchic institution, the Supreme Court operates with the au thority and often with the opacity of a modern Delphic oracle. Moreover, it works in an atmosphere of strict secrecy; its public face is limited to largely ceremonial but at times helpful oral arguments and to periodic announcement of decisions. What takes place behind the red velour curtain of the Marble Palace is a tightly held secret, as are the internal operations of all courts.17 Lack of accountability plus secrecy plus what most observers assert is a considerable power add up to an untidy sum. It is a form of elitism, even despotism, often benevolent no doubt,18 that fits uneasily into a constitutional order usually (unthinkingly) called democratic. (I believe that it is more confusing than useful to employ the word "democracy" as if it meant something commonly accepted. That it does not should be obvious, there being by one count at least two hundred definitions of the term.19) Hence the arguments since Marbury v. Madison about the role of the Supreme Court and the self-asserted power of the judiciary "to say what the law is." 20 Judges, moreover, are part of the political process and in fact would be meaningless and functionless outside of politics. Excessive preoccupation, by lawyers and scholars alike, with law as legalism has by and large beclouded this indisputable fact. And if politics involve, as Harold Lasswell has said, answering the question of who gets what, where, when, and how?, then it is important to analyze the Court—the judiciary generally—as one does other political institutions. Who wins lawsuits becomes the basic, indispensable criterion—not, as some would have it, the reasoning of judges or the</page><page sequence="6">338 ARTHUR S. MILLER way in which judicial opinions are written. The reasoning and opinions are important only to lawyers; "result-orientation" is an unavoidable aspect of the adversary system, as reflected in the judicial process.21 That means that judicial activism is to be evaluated in terms of "democratic" theory—in terms, that is, of furtherance of the values of due process and of equality. By definition, the adversary system, as reflected in the American judiciary and its operation, means due process; it is constitutional ism as Daniel Bell defined the term. But the fact that the Supreme Court engages, as Professor Martin Shapiro has said, "in the very stuff of routine politics," 22 should not be taken to mean that it is equatable in all respects with the avowedly political branches of government. It has functions diffe rent from those of Congress, in the main a charismatic role that fulfills, as the Grand Inquisitor put it, some of the desires of humans—for miracle, mystery, and authority. The Court, any court, is clothed with mystery and speaks with authority; small wonder, then, that people at times look to the judges for miracles, for ways to save them—the people—from their own follies. That judges cannot do that is obvious, but in a secular society imbued with religiosity but not real religion there is no substitute. Shapiro has argued that "the real problem" about the Court is how to enable it to make policy—that is, act politically—while professing to be apolitical; as Shapiro puts it, "without violating those popular and professional expectations of 'neutrality' which are an important factor in our legal tradition and a principal source of the Supreme Court's prestige." 23 He wants the impossible. A jurisprudence of nondisclosure about the judiciary surely cannot—more, should not—be rebuilt. It is too late in the day for "the distinction between what the Court tells the public about its activities and what scholars tell each other" any longer to have the semblance of validity. "It would be fantastic," Shapiro continues, "if the Supreme Court ... were to disavow publicly the myth upon which its power rests."24 Fantastic, perhaps, but that is precisely what has happened since those words were written. Justice Byron White, among others, has openly acknowledged that the Court's task in constitutional interpretation is one of creativity, of making law.25 (That bespeaks a jurisprudence of process, rather than one of logical principles internally consistent</page><page sequence="7">Judicial Activism 339 one with another.) And the heavens have not fallen; the Supreme Court and the judiciary generally is still high in esteem among governmental institutions (President Richard Nixon knew that he could not defy the Court's unanimous decision in 1974 on the White House tape recordings); and federal judges, such as Garrity and Johnson, become obviously and deeply immersed in "political" matters. The public, as Professor Leonard Levy has acknowledged, cares about results: 26 it does not read judicial opinions. Contrary to those who, like Professor Shapiro, advocate "squid jurisprudence"— covering the operations of the judiciary in a dense cloud of black ink—the prestige and ultimately the power of the courts depends on something rather more substantial than adherence to a long exploded myth.27 JUDICIAL ACTIVISM IN PERSPECTIVE Led by a gaggle of professors, many of whom are votaries in the cult of Frankfurter worship, it has become fashionable in recent years to characterize, and usually to castigate, the Supreme Court (and other courts) as being too activist. The term is only loosely employed; it is never adequately defined. A high-level abstraction, it seems to mean that the Justices since Earl Warren became Chief Justice have been too ready openly to create new law and to break new constitutional ground. The advocates of judicial passivity appear to disagree with Justice William O. Douglas's assertion in 1962 that constitutional questions are "always open." 28 Refusing to concede that a refusal to decide is itself a decision, a decision at least to maintain the status quo, and failing to follow the logic of the open secret that judges are philosophically not fungible,29 the passivists desire a somnolent judiciary which is not an active participant in the travail of society. Their views are, of course, fully entitled to First Amendment protection, although it should always be remembered that the amendment merely protects speech and that it does not require it to be "true" or accurate. Activism, to be sure, does characterize much of the judiciary today, as Professor Glazer tells us. In at least three ways, that activism has characteristics not mentioned by Glazer. First, the judges—particularly the Justices of the Supreme Court—have since at least Cooper v. Aaron 30 at times issued general, as distinguished</page><page sequence="8">340 ARTHUR S. MILLER from specific, norms; second, they have begun to issue "back-door" advisory opinions sua sponte; and third, with the change in nature of the state from a negative, night-watchman posture to one of affirmative orientation, the judges have begun to operate to say "you must" at times as well as what they said historically: "you cannot." That Glazer is correct about the increased activity of courts does not mean that he is accurate when he says that judges are to enunciate "the will of the people"; nor is it at all clear that the state, if by that word is meant something different from the people, is harmed by judicial activism.31 Each aspect requires explanation; but before doing so, it is desirable to discuss the general question of judicial activism. Speaking generally, federal judges have always been activist. Since 1803 the Supreme Court has maintained that "it is em phatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is."32 Since the beginnings of the republic the question is: What direction should judicial activism take? Brief reference to history will help to validate that statement. Since 1789, much of American constitutional law has revolved around the development of finance capitalism. Early on, the Supreme Court, as is well known, was a nationalizing influence. Under the domination of Chief Justice John Marshall, its decisions in Marbuiy, Martin, McCulloch, Cohens, and Gibbons33 constitutionally permitted a vast increase in the powers of the federal government. Marbuiy, to be sure, was naysaying; but in a way that established the Court as the ultimate arbiter of constitutionality. At the same time, astute use of the obligation of contracts clause in such cases as Fletcher v. Peck and Dartmouth College v. Woodward34 both cut away state-government regulation designed to curb the businessman and paved the way for the economic exploitation of the continent. The "basic doctrine of American constitutional law" was, as Professor Edward S. Corwin said, "vested rights." 35 The Marshall Court's activism promoted government interven tion into economic life in ways to aid the growing number of business corporations. As Professor Wallace Mendelson has put it: "Conservative tradition insists that by putting the sanctity of 'contracts' above other considerations of ethics and public welfare, Marshall and his associates promoted economic stability. Would it not be more accurate to suggest rather that they encouraged the</page><page sequence="9">Judicial Activism 341 flagrant corruption of state politics and reckless waste of natural resources that marked the nineteenth century? Surely judicial protection of fraud in the Yazoo land scandal paved the way for the Robber Barons and their Great Barbecue at the expense of the American people." 36 The point, for present purposes, is that the Supreme Court early on was quite activist—as much so as in recent years. Only the issues differ. Then it was finance capitalism; now it is civil rights and civil liberties. Moreover, Chief Justice Marshall in Fletcher v. Peck established the practice, since followed, of finding new rights and principles buried in the vague contours of the Constitution. Influenced by what Hamilton called "the first princi ples of natural justice and social policy," 37 he invalidated Georgia's attempt to prevent an enormous fraud (perpetrated, it is meet to note, by two United States senators; two congressmen; and three prominent judges, including an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court). The state of Georgia, Marshall went on to say, "was restrained" from passing a rescission of the fraudulent land sale "either by general principles which are common to our free institutions, or by particular provisions of the Constitution of the United States." 38 There should be little wonder, then, that judges today articulate political theories of what is socially proper when called upon to interpret the Constitution—particularly when one recalls what Justice William Johnson said while concurring in Fletcher: "I do not hesitate to declare that a state does not possess the power of revoking its own grants. But I do it, on a general principle, on the reason and nature of things; a principle which will impose laws even on the Deity."39 The Warren Court at its most extravagant extension of doctrine—as, say, in Miranda v. Arizona 40— or the Nixon Court, at times equally extravagant—as, say, in the abortion cases 41—never went as far as did Johnson (to try to bind the deity). Judicial activism after the Civil War took two directions. First was the continued protection of business enterprise, at the expense of the workingman, who was asked to bear many of the burdens of an industrializing nation; second, since 1937 the equality principle has been expanded to enhance civil rights and liberties. The half century between the time that the Justices casually agreed, without argument, that the corporation was a person under the Fourteenth Amendment,42 and thus protected by the due process clause, and</page><page sequence="10">342 ARTHUR S. MILLER the time when hydraulic pressures of social protest peaked in the mid-1980s to create the "constitutional revolution" of 1937 was characterized by judges, in both private and public law, being in effect an arm of the business community and their minions in the political branches of government.43 Activism, again, so much so that John R. Commons could in 1924 call the Supreme Court "the first authoritative faculty of political economy in the world's history." 44 Conservatives then, contrary to today, looked upon the Constitution and the Court as bulwarks against a rising tide of majoritarian democracy. Conservatives, in other words, welcomed judicial activism; their ox was not being gored at that time. Judicial activism since 1937 is too recent and too well known for more than brief mention. The Justices first constitutionalized Keynesian economics and the American version of the welfare state; and then, having stripped themselves of their historical role of protecting finance capitalism, they cast around and found in the rising tide of equalitarianism ways to continue its position as "equal in origin and equal in title" 45 to the other branches of government. But in so doing the Court added new twists to its propensity for innovation. The redefinition, first, took the posture of propounding norms of general applicability—something new under the constitutional sun. The landmark opinion is Cooper v. Aaron, the Little Rock school desegregation case. There a unanimous Court, in an opinion unique because it was individually signed by each Justice (rather than the usual practice of one member writing an opinion or of issuing decisions per curiam), maintained that "the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution." The Court went on to assert that "every state legislator and executive, and judicial officer is solemnly committed by oath taken pursuant to Article VI, cl. 3, to support the Constitution." The Marbury activism took an exponential jump; the writ of the Court ran generally, not merely to the parties before the bench. That type of activism has since been repeated in other contexts. In 1966, for example, a divided Court in Miranda v. Arizona 46 not only overruled past precedent but promulgated a little code of criminal procedure as to when lawyers must be present during police interrogations of suspected criminals. Such a "back-door" advisory opinion is the second facet of the</page><page sequence="11">Judicial Activism 343 new judicial activism. The Justices at times go far beyond the facts of a given case and attempt to settle a number of problems at once. When in 1973 the Nixon Court, led by "strict constructionists" Harry Blackmun, Lewis Powell, and Warren Burger, not only validated voluntary abortion by consenting females but went much further to establish a trimester system when a state might regulate abortions,47 it so staggered one law professor that he asserted, quite seriously, that the decisions were "not constitutional law," 48 a piece of intelligence that should interest the attorneys general of Texas and Georgia (where the suits were brought) as well as the Supreme Court itself. What the president and the Congress cannot do obtain an advisory opinion from the Supreme Court—the Court at times does sua sponte. These opinions, furthermore, are general norms, far wider than even class actions. (It is wryly amusing to note that the same group of Justices who made class actions more difficult 49 at times make law wholesale by issuing opinions that they say bind everyone, not merely individuals or members of a class.) Finally, modern judicial activism sometimes has an affirmative thrust. Rather than being a series of "thou shalt nots," from time to time it takes the form of judges saying what other governmental officials must do. Put another way, there has been a noticeable tendency in recent years for courts to impose affirmative duties upon government rather than leaving officials to determine their options after invalidating one of those options. Discretion over policy thus was taken from, say, school officials or state legislatures and vested (again, at times) in the judiciary. Green v. School Board provides an illustration. Said Justice William Brennan for the Court: "school boards operating [dual] school systems were required by Brown II 'to effectuate a transition to a racially nondiscriminatory school system.' " Brennan went on to say that under the second Brown decision school boards "then operating state-compelled dual systems were nevertheless clearly charged with the affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch." His conclusion merits close attention: "The Board must be required to formulate a new plan and, in light of other courses which appear open to the Board, such as zoning, fashion steps which promise realistically to convert promptly to a system without a 'white' school</page><page sequence="12">344 ARTHUR S. MILLER and a Negro school, but just schools." 50 Other decisions of the same genre are in the books, not only in racial matters, but also in legislative reapportionment and criminal procedure.51 The net result, in school cases at least, is that the federal judiciary has indeed become a "national school board."52 The logical extension of the Court enunciating affirmative duties was seen, moreover, in December 1975 when District Judge W. Arthur Garrity summarily removed a Boston school board and placed it in "receivership," with himself in charge.53 Receivership is a term in the law of bankruptcy, and while in a loose sense the Boston school might be bankrupt in that it had not complied with judicial orders to integrate the system, surely it was not in the financial sense. All of that presumably flowed logically from the Supreme Court's unan imous opinion, authored by Chief Justice Burger, in the Charlotte Mecklenburg busing case and the Keyes case.54 It indicates once again how a principle once enunciated often tends to be carried to its logical extreme—a phenomenon that Glazer attributes to the training of lawyers to see and value continuity. The new activist posture, then, relates not only to the issues being decided. True enough, the power of the federal government is steadily being further constitutionalized, just as it was in John Marshall's time. Maryland v. Wirtz and Perez v. United States provide examples of that.55 In the former, the application of the federal wage and hour act of 1938 to state employees was upheld as a valid exercise of the power of Congress to regulate commerce; while in Perez an admittedly local criminal action (loansharking) was held to be within the purview of federal law because, as Justice Douglas said for the Court, "loan sharking in its national setting is one way organized crime holds its guns to the heads of the poor and the rich alike and syphons funds from numerous localities to finance its national operations." In other words, organized crime (including loansharking) is a national problem requiring a national solution. Douglas did not mention Kansas v. Colorado, a 1907 decision holding that because a social problem transcended state lines did not ipso facto give Congress power to act.56 Activism by the courts today is principally in areas of individual rights and liberties. And it is there that the Court has made a mutational leap—an exponential jump into new forms of innova</page><page sequence="13">Judicial Activism 345 tion. Why such a foray into what had theretofore largely been judicial terra incognita should pose serious questions of the legitimacy of those exercises of power is completely mysterious. But that is precisely what is being argued, at times in words bordering on strident incredulity.57 Like Edmund Burke after the French Revolu tion,58 the neoconservatives see Jacobins at the gates of the city, led—astoundingly—by those men (and a few women) in black robes whose predecessors had manned the barricades against the onslaught of the mob. A strange twist to history, one might conclude, unless it be true, as I think it is, that the judges are the true conservatives. Like Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s, they are trying to save the "system." Professor Glazer sees "harm to the state" emanating from judicial activism—a cryptic remark proffered without explanation of the nature of the harm or of the nature of the state itself. Apparently Glazer equates the state with something different from the arith metical sum of the interests of the people who live in the United States—perhaps an anthropomorphic superperson in the Gierkian sense.59 It will do little good, in fact it will do much harm, to make such unsupported statements. One supposes that Glazer has not thought through the question. THE WILL OF THE "LAW"-OR OF THE "PEOPLE"? What, precisely, is the function of the Court in constitutional interpretations? Even now, two centuries after the formation of the republic, there is no settled conception of what Cardozo called "the nature of the judicial process." The ideal may be simply stated: the Court is to give effect "to the will of the law." As Chief Justice John Marshall said in 1824, possibly with tongue in cheek (could he actually have believed these words?): Courts are mere instruments of the law, and can will nothing. When they are said to exercise a discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law; and when that is discerned, it is the duty of the court to follow it. Judicial power is never exercised for the</page><page sequence="14">346 ARTHUR S. MILLER purpose of giving effect to the will of the judge; always for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the legislature; or, in other words, to the will of the law.60 Marshall in effect echoed Blackstone and Bacon. Said the former: a judge is "sworn to determine, not according to his own private judgment, but according to the known laws and customs of the land; not delegated to pronounce a new law, but to maintain and expound the old one." Said Bacon: "Judges ought to remember, that their office is jus dicere, and not Jus dare; to interpret law, and not to make law, or give law. Else it will like the authority, claimed by the Church of Rome, which under pretext of exposition of Scripture, doth not stick to add or alter; and to pronounce that which they do not find; and but show of antiquity to introduce novelty." 61 The problem is to understand the nature of judicial decision making. Dean Edward Levi once called it "reasoning by analogy," pointing out that the pretense of the declaratory theory of law (as espoused by Marshall, Blackstone, and Bacon) has long been rejected. This may be close to the mark, but is not really helpful, for Levi does not explain the criteria by which one analogy is chosen over another. On the other hand, Professor Glazer—amazingly—suggests that it is the duty of judges to give effect to "the will of the people," drawing on Lord Bryce for support. "To construe the law," Bryce wrote of the Supreme Court, "that is, to elucidate the will of the people as supreme lawgiver, is the beginning and end of their duty." Bryce then adds in a footnote: "Suppose, however," someone may say, "that the court should go beyond its duty and import its own views of what ought to be the law into its decision of what is the law. This would be an exercise of judicial will." Doubtless, it would, but it would be a breach of duty, would expose the court to the distrust of the people, and might, if repeated or persisted in a</page><page sequence="15">Judicial Activism 347 serious matter, provoke resistance to the law as laid down by the court.62 What, however, can "the will of the people" mean? At the very least, perhaps, it may suggest that in the ultimate resolution of social matters, nothing official—from whatever source—will prevail unless it is accepted by the people. But what will the people accept? And how are judges to know? On the other hand, if the will of the people means that the judges are to intuit some sort of public consensus on specific issues, other problems obtrude. What is the "public"? And how is that consensus to be determined? Is a Gallup poll to be the test of constitutionality or of judicial propriety? Those questions answer themselves, and suggest that Professor Glazer either is not serious in his talk about the will of the people or that he has not thought through the implications of such a position. Furthermore, and this is of greater significance, the logical end of Glazer's position is one of major itarianism—precisely what the neoconservatives in general appear to abhor. If constitutionalism has any core meaning in the United States, one aspect of it is that the majority does not always prevail, that the individual qua individual or qua member of decentralized group at times can win out over what majorities want. It will simply not do, accordingly, to argue as does Professor Shapiro that "if the Court is to be successful as a political actor, it must have the authority and public acceptance that the principled, reasoned opinion brings." 63 Shapiro's focus is on the wrong part of the Court's work—the justification or rationalization rather than the decision. It is who won or who lost that counts, not how the game was played. Even most lawyers, Chief Justice Roger Traynor of the California Supreme Court once said, do not understand how appellate judges make up their minds.64 How, then, can the opinions, as distinguished from the results, matter? Rather closer to the mark was Professor Alexander Bickel, who in 1962 opined that "the Court should declare as law only such principles as will—in time, but in a rather foreseeable future—gain general assent. . .. The Court is a leader of opinion, not a mere register of it, but it must lead opinion, not merely impose its own;</page><page sequence="16">348 ARTHUR S. MILLER and—the short of it is—it labors under the obligation to succeed." 65 Indeed it does; but what Bickel did not answer is how the Justices can determine which principles can "gain general assent." Here, as with Glazer and Bryce, one is reminded of the pungent remarks of Judge Jerome Frank: In Repouille v. United States, a citizenship case involving the question of whether Repouille was a person of "good moral character," as the statute required, Judge Frank said: The precedents in this circuit constrain us to be guided by contemporary public opinion [in determining good moral character] about which, cloistered as judges are, we have but vague notions. (One recalls Gibbon's remark that usually a person who talks of "the opinion of the world at large" is really referring to "the few people with whom I happened to converse.") Seeking to apply a standard of this type, courts usually do not rely on evidence but utilize what is often called the doctrine of "judicial notice," which, in matters of this sort, properly permits informal inquiries by the judges. However, for such a purpose ... the courts are inadequately staffed so that sometimes "judicial notice" actually means judicial ignor ance.66 If judicial notice at times becomes, as Judge Frank said later, mere "cocktail hour knowledge,"67 then serious questions about the nature of the adversary system of settling litigation—and in constitutional questions, large questions of public policy—are raised. There is simply no way under the way the system now operates for judges to ascertain "the will of the people" or to determine which principles will in time "gain general assent." Furthermore, "the will of the law" cannot be determined if by that phrase it is meant that the judge locates in what Jhering called "a heaven of legal concepts" the one principle or rule to guide the decision. For it is manifest that in any case that reaches the Supreme Court and gets attention "on the merits"—and perhaps in all appellate litigation— the principles of doctrinal polarity operates. There are always inconsistent lines of doctrine—of the law—and it is the task of the judge to choose from between them. In so doing, he must—as Justice White has told us—create law.</page><page sequence="17">Judicial Activism 349 We are left, then, in a parlous situation indeed if the goal is to have something other than "the will of the judge" in operation in constitutional and other decision-making. For when all is said and done, it is indeed the will of the judge that is articulated. There are no external standards of judgment that bind the Justices; they can pick and choose within the broad parameters of the adversary system and to the extent that they think their decisions will be accepted.68 That evaluation must, of course, be intuitive; one has only to point to Frankfurter's cloudy crystal ball in Baker v. Can to know that his fear of judicial intrusion into the briar patch of legislative reapportionment did not eventuate. The basic question from the standpoint of American constitu tionalism is to determine how much discretionary power the people are willing to consign to the judges in the making of what Frankfurter once called sociologically wise decisions. That problem, even today, has not yet been answered (almost two centuries after the Supreme Court began to operate as an informal council of revision of the acts of other governmental agencies). It is a problem that surely is not going to be answered by reference to Blackstonian theories or by citation of people long dead, including Lord Bryce. The vague contours of a possible way to approach it are suggested here. A beginning may be made with the reminder that the courts are part and parcel of the political process. No one denies that they make law. But so do other, nominally democratic (in that they are elected) organs of government: the Congress and the president. And so does the appointed bureaucracy (as well as the private bu reaucracies of the nation).69 Judicial discretion thus should be seen in the context of the entire spectrum of governmental activities. In one of his last opinions, Justice William O. Douglas iterated one of his familiar themes: "... the entire federal bureaucracy is vested with a discretionary power, against the abuse of which the public needs protection. 'Administrators must strive to do as much as they reasonably can to develop and make known the needed confine ments of discretionary power through standards, principles and rules.' "70 Americans have become accustomed to and accept legislative discretion, even though the sanction of the ballot box is more apparent than real; and not only accept but appear to demand presidential discretion, including that of the bureaucracy</page><page sequence="18">350 ARTHUR S. MILLER (over which the president nominally rules). Only an occasional maverick, such as Justice Douglas, or a law professor, such as Kenneth Culp Davis, are perturbed by the well-nigh uncontrolled discretion vested in much of the bureaucracy, high and low.71 Rather than being bothered by it, some observers applaud it as a necessary feature of government in the modern era. That being so, why is there perturbation about the discretion of federal judges? Theirs is a power of decision that is usually final, whether it be district judges (the bulk of whose rulings are never appealed), or appeals judges who in the circuit courts operate as "mini-supreme courts" because most of their decisions are never reviewed on the merits, or the Supreme Court itself. Judges are like administrators in that their decisions are both discretionary and final, and both are not elected (and thus responsible to the electorate). Both groups of public officials are not "accountable" in the constitutional sense of having to answer in another place for their actions. The reference here is to the great bulk of decisions, judicial and administrative, not to the occasional one that does get reviewed in another place. The sporadic and happenstance should not be taken for the usual: judicial review of administrative action is a sometime thing (in which the bureaucrat is usually sustained), and the few appeals from lower court decisions usually do not prevail. Life in the "administrative state" that is the United States of America has its drolleries. For a lawyer, who must get his amusement where he can find it, obsessive concentration upon a few hundred federal judges accompanied by little attention being accorded three million public and the several million private bureaucrats seems to be an odd misdirection of priorities. Further more, it is important to realize that only a relatively small segment of judicial discretion is under fire. Plea bargaining, for example, is seldom criticized, whether it is on the level of crimes in the streets or crimes in the (executive) suites. In both, and in between, a rough form of barter economics replaces the "rule of law." Prosecutors routinely engage in this practice, one in which judges equally routinely participate and which has the weighty authority of the Supreme Court to validate it. Sentencing practices of judges are notorious for being uneven, but that has not exercised many commentators (e.g., Glazer does not mention this aspect of what he</page><page sequence="19">Judicial Activism 351 calls an "imperial judiciary"). Moreover, thousands of decisions tumble each year from the judicial spigots without public or private reaction (or even knowledge). WHY THE OPPOSITION? In final analysis, there is no escape from the proposition that judges are entrusted with immense discretion. Even if in the vast majority of decisions there are no social ripples of dissent, at times the exercise of discretion does—as is obvious—draw fire. Conse quently, it is necessary to determine which decisions of the federal courts today pose the question of excès de pouvoir. Four decisional areas may be noted: administration of the criminal law, separation of church and state, racial relations, and abortion. There may be others, but these are noteworthy for having been vociferously criticized by professional commentators and segments of the public alike—the basic criterion of choice. Legislative reapportionment is not placed in that listing, for the controversy appears to have died down; the legal doctrine is settled in large part, even if the politics remain. Is there a common thread running through the four categories that enables one to analyze the problem of judicial power? I believe that there is—and that it deals only partly with the new activism discussed above. General norms judicially promul gated are well on the way to acceptance.72 Back-door advisory opinions raise hackles only if they deal with certain issues.73 The third leg of the new activism is somewhat different—where courts attempt to tell people what they must do, as distinguished from what they cannot do. Obviously there are semantic problems in perceiving judicially imposed "duties" as compared with "limita tions," 74 but nonetheless it is here that some of the public and some of the professions unite, not in unanimous disagreement with examples of judicial fiat, but with enough anger or dismay that it is easy to perceive that something basic is at work. What, then, is their common denominator? It is fairly simple and equally obvious: Each of the decisional areas directly affects the personal life-styles of many Americans or deals with personally held, deeply felt, irra tional beliefs. The attack, to be sure, has seldom been so bluntly put. For the professional critic, disagreement is couched in high level abstractions: the reasoning of the Justices is subjected to</page><page sequence="20">352 ARTHUR S. MILLER scathing analysis; seldom is there a stated disapproval of the result reached. For the public it is different. The laity cares nothing for reasoning; it wants to know who won and who lost and, of supreme importance, what does it mean to me? The question this poses is crucial—and unanswerable: Are the professional critics of the Court's decisions hiding their objections to the results reached behind a cloud of legalistic verbiage? And are those among the professoriate who are not concerned with reasons and structured opinions tacitly indicating their approval of the results? One would have to know the motivations of each commen tator to state an adequate answer to that. However impossible it may be to answer, however, the problem should be faced. No one lawyer or judge or layman or political scientist—is a dispassionate observer of the human comedy. We all tote our preferences and predilections around with us; these may be known but hidden or unknown and still hidden. That much, I think, is clear; there is a myth of neutrality in legal research and writing.75 Gunnar Myrdal, who comes as close to being a modern (social science) Renaissance man as anyone in this century, has noted this in several books. He calls, as a consequence, for a person to "face his valuations" and to state them for all to see when reading some discourse.76 In my judgment, he is correct: with deference to those who belabor the Supreme Court for alleged faults of omission and commission, it is of vital importance that we know where they stand on the substantive issues, as well as on the methodology of judges.77 Judicial lawmaking means that choices must be made between conflicting principles leading to opposing ends. These choices are not logical derivations from agreed premises.78 The principle of doctrinal polarity being in operation, the law, by definition, is unclear; it is made by the decision of the Court, created anew in each case in some degree. If the choices that judges must make are, as Judge Braxton Craven maintains, always "result oriented," 79 then something of critical importance is at issue: the problem of ends or of goals. Yves Simon has asserted that in a democratic state "deliberation is about means and presupposes that the problem of ends has been settled." 80 But that is precisely what is lacking in the four decisional areas listed above. Compare two types of cases. First, Shapiro v. Thompson, in which residency requirements for welfare were cut down; Goldberg v. Kelly making a hearing necessary before welfare payment can be termi</page><page sequence="21">Judicial Activism 353 nated; Baker v. Can and its progeny, which established "one person one vote" as a constitutional principle; Perez v. United States, making local crime a federal problem; Boddie v. Connecticut, setting up a due process requirement of indigents' access to civil courts; and Reid v. Covert,81 invalidating courts-martial of civilian dependents of mili tary personnel serving abroad. In each the Court was activist; in each its reasoning was typical; in each it made new law. Second, Miranda v. Arizona, on the right to counsel for criminal suspects; Engel v. Vitale, outlawing prayers in public schools; Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, permitting racial integration of public schools by busing students; and Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton,82 the cases establishing when abortion could be regulated by the state. Again, each was an activist decision; in each its reasoning was in the usual mold; and each made new law. The second group, of course, is so controversial that constitutional amendments to overturn them have been seriously proposed in all save the Miranda situation—and there Congress, in the general area of criminal procedure, has dealt with some of the Warren Court decisions and the Nixon Court has chipped away slowly but steadily at the underpinnings of Miranda itself.83 The problem is to understand why these decisional types have been so stoutly resisted, while passive acquiescence has characterized the first group. Pro fessor Glazer attributes it to "the apathy of cynical and baffled people," in talking about why efforts of resistance to judicial decrees have failed thus far. (That probably means those people with whom he talks.) He ends his sharp critique of the Court by saying: In 1954 the Court abandoned prudence and for 15 years firmly and unanimously insisted that the segregation and degradation of the Negro must end. It succeeded, and even tually the legislative and executive branches came to its side and the heritage of unequal treatment was eliminated. That was indeed a heroic period in the history of the court. But even heroes may overreach themselves. It is now time for the Court to act with the prudence that must in a free society be the more regular accompaniment of its actions.84 But why would it have been prudential to refuse to rule in the designated (and similar) areas, and thus leave the final decision to the political branches? The answer is not self-evident. What values</page><page sequence="22">354 ARTHUR S. MILLER of constitutionalism are furthered by judicial passivity? Again, by no means is the answer obvious—or even ascertainable. It is idle, even mischievous, of Glazer to talk of "the will of the people" as if it could be ascertained or as if "the people" were an identifiable entity or, of more importance, as if "the will of the people" determined the decisions of legislatures or executives. The Supreme Court, to be sure, is an oligarchic institution, but so, too, are Congress and the state legislatures, as well as the ostensibly representative bodies of local government; and so, too, are executives at any level of government. To call the courts "authoritarian," as Glazer does, is to confuse the mythology of American governance with the reality. Judges are no more authoritarian than executive officials and bureaucrats—and surely are less so than those who control the giant corporations, financial institutions, and labor unions. Each of these groups probably exercises more power in fact, if not in constitu tional theory, than do the judges. Judges, after all, are bound by the invisible chains of the adversary system and by institutional imperatives leading to conformity. The Justices in each of the areas had three choices: to refuse to rule, to go along with the political branches, or to state their own understanding of the Constitution. Whatever the choice, they, consciously or not, had to make an evaluation of the probable harm of alternative decisions—to the people at large or to identifiable individuals. Both a refusal to rule and approval of the politicians' choices would mean that at least a few would be harmed, if not physically then psychically. If so, the Court would be approving majoritarianism; the rights of the individual would be swallowed up in a societal whole. The values of consensus would replace those of constitutionalism. Everyone of course has a full First Amendment right to such an opinion—that the majority—"the will of the people"—should always prevail, but that is hardly what constitu tionalism is all about. That, be it noted, is precisely what is at issue in the efforts, seriously begun in 1974 and 1975, to have a written bill of rights promulgated in Great Britain. The fear is of legislative majorities, dominated by the unions.85 There can be no doubt that the goals of white and black Americans do not coincide; nor do those who favor abortion against those who do not; nor those who fear an established religion and those who want subsidies for religious organizations from government; nor those caught in the</page><page sequence="23">Judicial Activism 355 toils of criminal-law administration and "society" at large. It is relatively easy to reconcile those goals politically. That is done routinely in legislatures and the public administration. But the problem is that the political system leaves many people dissatisfied and unhappy. The critical issue, however, is whether a lone individual or a minority group should have to bow down against his conscience and at times against human decency to that principle of majoritaria nism. The dilemma is clear: if the individual or group prevails, as in the four decisional areas, then others (in larger numbers) have to suffer losses. Who should bear the burden of conformity? And to what? The best that can be hoped for is what we now have, something at times denigrated as the "guardian ethic," 86 but something for which in the American system there is no replacement. If Justices of the Supreme Court (and other judges) do not act at times to catch the conscience of the people, and to draw them up short and make them rethink their premises, there is no one else. Not Congress, not the president, not the leaders of private life; not one is up to the mark. In the American constitutional order, only the judges can—if they will, which by no means is certain—as Judge Learned Hand suggested in a famous passage.87 What, then, of the legitimacy of the Supreme Court's (and that of the other courts) activism in recent decades? The short answer is the same as that for the legitimacy of its Marbury role: it has been established. One decision alone proves the point: United States v. Nixon, in which the Court said that the now-disgraced president had to give up the famous tapes to the special prosecutor of the Watergate conspiracy. When Nixon capitulated, after hints by his counsel that he might not, for the first time in American history the writ of the Court ran against the president qua chief executive. As with his predecessor, President Truman,88 Nixon clearly saw that defiance of the Court would have been disaster. An activist judiciary prevailed. The American people cheered. In general, it is not excès de pouvoir that is at the core of discontent; rather, it is the direction of the exercise of power—whose ox is being gored.89 A "democratic" nation will continue to tolerate an activist judiciary; and if sheer numbers of people are concerned, they may demand it—as Glazer implies.90 For he inveighs against the public interest</page><page sequence="24">356 ARTHUR S. MILLER lawyers, those who in recent years have helped to bring a flood of new types of litigation—and of litigants—into the courts. This means that more people are expecting relief for perceived troubles and also that they are using the established institutions of American constitutionalism to try to effect social change. When the avowedly political branches of government are unresponsive, what other peaceful avenue do they have? Close off the judiciary, as Glazer wishes, and the bottled-up furies of discontent may well explode. To oppose the use of the system by public interest lawyers is to oppose what Bickel called "the morality of process"—to him "the highest morality." 91 Furthermore, a judiciary adhering to the "passive virtues" means, in final analysis, a passive populace, one in which "the masses" know their place and keep it. But, again, is that what constitutionalism means? Hardly. YES, BUT ... A court may pronounce but it cannot administer. It must, in the usual case, trust the bona fides of others—officials in other branches of the federal government and of the state and local governments—to translate its decree into operational reality. Judge Garrity's appoint ment of a receiver for the Boston High School is so unusual that it surely will not be quickly emulated.92 In some of the reapportion ment cases judges have, of course, told the legislatures to redraw the voting districts or the court would do it for them. Again, the legislatures capitulated. But a federal judge is not likely to drive a school bus or to monitor schoolrooms to learn whether prayers are being said. Nor is a judge likely to listen to the conversations of doctors and their female patients who want abortions. And those who administer the criminal law will do so without the presence of a man in a black robe or his designate. In net, there are and there will continue to be administrative checks on judicial power, just as there are lower court checks on Supreme Court power, as well as Supreme Court checks on lower court power. As Bishop Hoadly said in 1717 in his sermon to the King: "Whoever hath an absolute authority to interpret any written or spoken laws, it is he who is truly the lawgiver, to all intents and purposes, and not the person who first spoke or wrote them." Whether an activist judiciary is also a powerful organ of</page><page sequence="25">Judicial Activism 357 governance, in the sense of being able to promulgate binding, permanent norms on the people, is an unanswered question. Professor Glazer believes that the courts are "authoritarian" and are increasingly subjecting a "free people" to the "arbitrary rule of unreachable authorities." (But how can they be authoritarian when the adversary system is used? Is that not an example of "the morality of process"?) This, he says, has led to a loss of respect and trust of the courts by the people. Strong statements, those— particularly if they are accurate perceptions. But are they? I suggest not—that the judiciary is far from "imperial," and that in the long and perhaps even the short run the judges will not prevail. Americans are not close to having a government by judiciary, even with the new activism and the explosion of litigation. Societal decisions, insofar as they are made by public government, are in final analysis articulated by legislatures and, of much more importance, administrators. Adolf Berle said a few years ago that: "Ultimate legislative power in the United States has come to rest in the Supreme Court of the United States."93 Professor Philip Kurland is nearer the mark when he recently said, "ultimate legislative power ... resides not in the judicial branch but in the executive branch of the National Government." 94 Kurland echoed Professor Clinton Rossiter, who in 1960 called the president the "Chief Legislator," and Amaury de Riencourt, the European social critic, whose 1957 volume, The Coming Caesars, merits close attention as a description of American government.95 The basic question being one of power, how then can one assess that of the courts, particularly that very special court, the Supreme Court of the United States? Analysis should begin with the following kept in mind: (1) having neither purse nor sword, as Alexander Hamilton said, the judiciary still remains "the least dangerous" of the departments of government "to the political rights of the Constitution"; (2) the modern state is the administra tive state; if with the fall of Richard Nixon, the presidency no longer can be called imperial, then surely the bureaucracy can; 96 (3) two factors characterize the social context in which American governmental institutions must operate: first, the growing realiza tion of the finite nature of man, his resources and his power, and second, as Senators Frank Church and Charles Mathias said in July 1974, "emergency government has become the norm"; 97 and (4)</page><page sequence="26">358 ARTHUR S. MILLER the capacity of the law, however enunciated and promulgated, to change behavior patterns and thoughts of the American people is at best an open question; data do not exist to substantiate firm conclusions on the problem. Lawyers and political scientists and Court watchers generally assume that the Supreme Court has enormous power. Any assess ment should place it on a continuum with other governmental institutions, public and private.98 The Court can then be viewed comparatively. If such a power continuum of the American polity were to be constructed, it would look something like this: at one end is the lone individual, who is relatively meaningless in the indus trialized and urbanized nation-state that is the United States of America. Politically speaking—that is, in terms of power—an individual is significant only as a member of a group or groups.99 The isolated individual does not exist as such. The group, the Constitution to the contrary notwithstanding, is the basic societal unit. Only groups have political or economic power. Robert Merriam put it well in 1944: "The lone individual does not figure either in family relations, in neighborhood relations, in state relations, or in the higher values of religion. Nowhere is he left without guiding social groups, personalities, and principles." 100 At the other end of the continuum are the massive organizations of the bureaucratic state: Big Government, Big Business, Big Labor, Big Foundations, Big Farmers' Organizations, Big Veterans' Legions, Big Churches, Big Universities. These bureaucracies tend to interlock; they cooperate as much as they conflict; they make up the administrative apparatus for "the corporate state, American style." 101 No American is untouched by one and usually more of these organizational monstrosities. We all are beholden to them in one form or another. There the power lies in American govern ment—and there it will remain. There is little or no likelihood that they will be broken up; the contrary will probably be true: they will continue and they will grow and they will envelop not only the nation but the world.102 Somewhere between those extremes lie the two embattled depart ments of government—Congress and the courts. Speaking generally, and with full recognition of recent attempts to regain lost power or attain new power, Congress is still the sapless branch of govern ment. It is like a great beached whale, still alive, but mindlessly</page><page sequence="27">Judicial Activism 359 flipping its tail to and fro; now and then a flip of the tail can be lethal, as Richard Nixon and his merry men learned. But that is the exception and should not be taken as evidence of much more than that Congress still has some energy, but not much; it cannot govern— and what is more: it does not want to govern.103 At most, Congress has an occasional but seldom used power of veto. Without filling in the details of the range of power exercise in the American polity, where do the courts fit? Certainly not with the locus of public power in the bureaucracy; and not even with Congress. Somewhere toward the individual but of course relatively far from him. Judges, including those on the Supreme Court, can enunciate norms, but require a reservoir of public acceptance to make them stick. Little exploration beyond the superficial level of poll-taking has been made into the factors which work for or against such acceptance or confidence. Moreover, far too few empirical studies have been made about compliance with judicial decisions— "impact analysis," as it is sometimes called—to reach firm conclu sions. What little is known with certainty is that at times there is compliance and at times there is not. Furthermore, the record, such as in church and state questions, varies from state to state throughout the country. The Justices shoot their thunderbolts from the Marble Palace on Mount Olympus, but whether they are merely hortatory pleas rather than acceptable commands depends upon some as yet little explored factors. Two of those factors are worth special mention: first, if decisions, as suggested above, cut too close to the bone of primordial and no doubt irrational beliefs and preferences, then noncompliance may result; and second, if it is granted, as is obvious, that the courts are part of the political process in the American constitutional order, then as with any other part of public government they must receive the approval, tacit or overt, of the leaders of the elite groups in the nation. As for the first, one example should suffice to illustrate the point: busing to achieve desegregation in the public schools. The funda mental issue about busing is not about the power of the judiciary; rather, it is the position of the black in American society. And of that this much can be said now: the white American, generally speaking, is not ready to accept the black as his equal and to accord him the same social status as whites receive. The National Advisory</page><page sequence="28">360 ARTHUR S. MILLER Commission on Civil Disorders asserted in 1968 that the United States was moving toward the formation of two nations, one white and one black.104 So we are, something presciently noted by Lerone Bennett in 1965: "The basic facts of the Negro situation is shattered community. Negro and white Americans do not belong to the same social body. They do not share that body of consensus or common feeling that usually binds together people sharing a common bond. ... Black man is incomprehensible to white man in America and vice versa: this is the root cause of the rebellion—broken community and the failure of Americans to create a single social organiza tion." 105 Despite Supreme Court pronouncements by the score and such congressional statutes as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, in the generation since the landmark decision in Shelley v. Kraemer 106 only surface changes have taken place. The black ghettoes still remain; the blacks are still at the low end of the pole of economic betterment; their unemployment rate is markedly higher than that for whites. In employment and else where, "tokenism" has replaced separate but equal. Most blacks are still separate and still unequal, and as the United States celebrated its Bicentennial serious efforts were being made in several pillars of the Establishment to "prove" scientifically that they are genetically inferior.107 Two inferences may be drawn from that basic indecency to a long subjugated 11 percent of the populace. One is that the mass of whites want it that way and are quite content to keep the blacks in a condition of second- or third-class citizenship. The other is that the power structure of the American polity also is quite content to rock along with cosmetic changes for the blacks but with nothing fundamental being done. One would have to probe deeply into the psyche of the white American to learn why and how his fears and dislike of blacks are motivated.108 That has not been done and perhaps cannot be done, but one thing is clear—the white intellec tual leaders of the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, who told the people in the South what they ought to do, are strangely silent when it comes to such places as Detroit, Michigan, or Boston, Massachusetts. Ivy League professors and media pundits who during the 1960s became missionaries to the "benighted" southerners and spoke confidently about what should be done do not march to integrate the South Boston High School or pontificate</page><page sequence="29">Judicial Activism 361 about their backyard. Suddenly the ox has turned, and it is the "enlightened" North that is being gored. And they do not like it. Of course, they do not live in South Boston, but in lily-white suburbs. The point is that they are unwilling to tackle the white Bostonian with the zeal that they attacked the white southerner. Indeed, there is no perceptible attack at all. Silence reigns supreme in Cambridge and New Haven and on Park Avenue, as two groups of disadvan taged—the Irish and the blacks—battle it out. (The intellectuals in some respects resemble those pillars of Washington society who considered it high sport and très amusant to ride out to see men kill each other at Bull Run.) This, of course, is not to condone the whites either in the South or in the North for their treatment of those citizens who had the lack of foresight not to be born with skins that shade of sallow pink so prized by the whites. The indecencies heaped upon the blacks, past and at the present, need no restatement here. They are too well known. My point is that most whites like it that way—and that is one of the principal, perhaps the principal, reason why judicial activism in racial matters, even when accompanied by political actions, is not prevailing in ways other than "tokenism" or cosmetic changes of no real substance. Despite Lerone Bennett's statement about "shattered community," America never has had "commu nity" in any sense of full participation by the blacks. The "com munity" that was shattered was one with black Americans in a permanently subservient position. Outside of a handful in sports and entertainment and "tokenism," blacks are still second-class citizens. They have full legal rights but are not accepted into the mainstream of American life. Nor is there much evidence that they will be. The gap between the law in books and social practice, already frighteningly large, is growing. Law indeed has its limits, however promulgated. The "Negro problem," as Gunnar Myrdal said in 1944,109 is really a problem in the hearts of white Americans. No one as yet knows how law can touch the hearts of anyone. If, as Pascal said, the heart has its reasons that Reason itself does not know, how is the putative rationality of the law to reach those reasons? That bleak fact underlies the power questions of the judiciary. Americans are schizoid about the black citizenry. Judges and others verbalize or intellectualize ideas of freedom and equality, only to</page><page sequence="30">362 ARTHUR S. MILLER run hard against feelings—emotional responses—that cut through the putative rationality of the law and help to trigger hidden resentments and insecurity, because the beneficiaries take judicial rulings and American rhetoric seriously. No reasonably adequate resolution of the problem will take place unless and until the rational and irrational come together. If that does not happen, the law however articulated simply is not going to be much more than an exhortation to be good or to be better, rather like Sunday sermons or newspaper editorials. Judges, again speaking generally, have no way of imposing sanctions upon those who do not obey their decrees. Judge Garrity's order to put a Boston high school in "receivership" means at most that the schools will be run by federal courts, not by elected school boards; emphatically it does not mean that the social situation will change. Would it make any difference if the American elites were to come out strongly for racial equality? Or, to put the question another way, is the apparent silence of most of the elite a tacit indication that the judges have lost, in some areas at least, a solid base of support in the community without which they cannot expect to be effective? Since the group theory of politics has, if not a dominant, at least a highly influential place in the thinking of political scientists, what are the consequences when a few federal judges are left to pursue their lonely way without the support, overt or tacit, of the most important groups? These questions must be answered if any comprehensive judgment is to be made upon judicial activism. Professor Glazer suggests a partial answer: "Even the guardians of the 'guardian ethic'—the better educated, the establishment, the opinion-makers—are now doubtful of many of the rulings they urged when, unable to institute them through the elected represen tatives of the people, they made law through recourse to the courts." Glazer does not tell us in which way the guardians are doubtful; we are left to infer that it is either dislike of specific rulings or of a growing belief there indeed may be "limits to state action," as von Humboldt maintained.110 Whatever the case, it is probable that if there are limits to governmental action, Americans must soon face one of the most potentially explosive social situations in their history. People in this country and elsewhere who have been taught to have expectations of personal betterment are now told, at times bluntly or even brutally, that it will not—it cannot—happen. When</page><page sequence="31">Judicial Activism 363 judges act in an "activist" way, they seem to be proceeding on an assumption that the limits of governmental action have not been reached. In this, they may be correct. No one knows the heights people may be able to reach. The judges may not prevail, but they should not be denigrated for trying to further the cause of human decency. One important segment of the American elite was not listed among the "guardians" by Professor Glazer: the corporate and financial managers of the country's supercorporations and giant banking and other financial concerns. The Supreme Court, for most of its history, protected this group; it was in fact its ultimate guardian against a burgeoning majoritarianism. Since 1937, however, the Court no longer blocks socioeconomic programs on the basis of the Justices' notions of general principles which are common to our free institutions—and thus lost their strongest historical power base. The businessman turned from being highly favorable to being at least indifferent and perhaps even hostile to the judiciary. The result was the use of Congress as a "super court of appeals" by business enterprises,111 accompanied by a lack of positive support for the judiciary. Other power groups—for example, the Roman Catholic church on the abortion and church-and-state issues—are similarly affected. Like the businessman, the attempt is to manipulate the political process, not the courts, as the way to achieve their ends. This can be put another way. The judiciary, not the legislature nor the bureaucracy—for both are captives of interest groups112—has become the forum for furthering the rights of the unallied and the disadvantaged. It is, in many respects, a forlorn hope, a final desperate attempt to influence the organs of American constitu tionalism without dropping into the abyss of violence. When the courts became the target of pressure from the black Americans, others on the lower scale of the social strata took hope that they, too, might get verbal and eventually emotional agreement with their demands. But these Americans—the poor, the black, the disadvan taged—by definition have insufficient political muscle adequate to alter public policy in fundamental ways. What they cannot do politically, it is doubtful that the courts can do for them. (The problems are multiplied when, as in South Boston, the disadvan taged are quarreling among themselves.)</page><page sequence="32">364 ARTHUR S. MILLER The judges, for example, cannot mandate employment oppor tunities for the hard-core unemployed (at this writing some nine million workers are known to be out of work). To be sure, the Employment Act of 1946 makes it express government policy to take action to maximize employment opportunities for those desiring to work.113 But even Professor Glazer's "imperial judiciary" is not likely to translate that statement of high policy into a requirement purportedly binding on Congress and the executive in fact to provide jobs, even though the need may be acute both in a personal and a societal sense. Tom Wicker, the columnist for the New York Times, said on December 14, 1975: "Leon Sullivan, a respected black leader from Philadelphia and a member of the board of General Motors, believes .. . that 'new seeds of insurrection are being sown in the cities of America' by the pervasive poverty to which unemployment rates contribute heavily, and that if nothing is done to move toward full employment 'within the next four years at most,' the resulting explosion will make the urban riots of the sixties 'look like little church meetings.' " 114 If there really were an imperial judiciary in the United States, then a constitutional right to a decent job could easily be found within the interstices of the due process and equal protection clauses. The argument is easily made. A necessitous man is not a free man. Liberty is protected by due process of law; that clause, as Chief Justice Hughes said in 1937,115 at times may require govern mental action. Due process thus would become an affirmative command as well as a negative limitation.116 The new judicial activism, noted above, in which affirmative duties are imposed upon government in certain situations could logically be extended to the economic sphere. But that, as some English say, "ain't bloody likely." The judiciary is impotent to deal with such abrasive social problems; like the people in Kansas City, the judges have "gone about as fur as they can go" in intervening in the political process. Certainly they have gone as far as most of them want to go. Absent strong, yet subtle pressure from their peer groups, the judges will probably choose to remain silent—to exercise what Frankfurter thought was the su preme judicial virtue of self-restraint, save for an occasional maverick. Unless the elites get behind the courts and support them in all of their actions, little more can be expected of them.</page><page sequence="33">Judicial Activism 365 CONCLUSION The law, said Emerson, is but a memorandum. By and large he was correct, even though law, both judge-made and otherwise, may have a considerable educational impact. But a memorandum of what? Government in the United States (and elsewhere) has always been and still is relative to circumstances. Judges know the limits of power. This does not mean that all will cease being activist—nor that they should stop intervening into abrasive human disputes. The judiciary, including the Supreme Court, is a part of govern ment; it should be allowed to perform its lawful and constitutional role. No doubt many of its decisions will be disliked by segments, large or small, of the populace; but consensus or majoritarianism is not now, nor should it ever be, a test of what is right and proper for the judges. American constitutionalism will suffer—the American people will suffer—if the courts do not continue to act. By continuing to be activist, to protect the values of constitutionalism rather than of consensus, they can operate as a partial safety valve for bottled-up social protest; they can provide a breathing spell to enable slow-moving legislatures and executives to respond to reasonable expectations. With all of their failures and with their obvious shortcomings, Americans need them; the requirement is not to denigrate them for being "activist"—as was said above, that has always been true of judges—but to provide them with the necessary help and resources better to perform their important role.117 There are important, unmet needs in our scholarship (and social decisions) concerning the judiciary. One is this: What values should a judge further? If activist judges are considered to be doing "good" things today, will not others in the future do "bad" things? By what criteria is the good to be separated from the bad? And further: If the judiciary is to be a primary agency for social change, should not more attention be paid to the quality of the people now chosen to be judges? As Professor Kurland has said, "For the most part, judges are narrow-minded lawyers with little background for making social judgments." 118 On a more technical but still important level, are Judges Garrity and Johnson performing nonjudicial functions while sitting as Article III judges? 119 Finally: Is it not time to examine the</page><page sequence="34">366 ARTHUR S. MILLER adversary system as a means of setting public policy, in order to make sure that a system taken from feudal days and used for settling minor problems of meum et teum is in fact adequate to the needs of a highly industrialized, continental-sized nation with worldwide interests? 120 These, among other matters, must be provided if indeed the judiciary will be able both to remain activist and to perform in a reasonably adequate manner. The challenge stated by Alexander Pekelis has been met in part, but in so doing some flaws in the system have become apparent. NOTES 1. A. Pekelis, Law and Social Action, pp. 1-41 (M.

Its premises are presumably taken as a given accepted, that is, as axiomatic^/ôr teaching purposes. Even Thurman Arnold, toward the end of his life, could maintain that the ideal of dispassionate justice, though "unattainable," was of "tremendous importance"; without it, "we would not have a civilized government." Arnold, "Professor Hart's Theology," 73 Harv. L. Rev. 1298 (1960). But Arnold can hardly be correct—although this is not the time to argue the point. For brief rejoinder to Arnold, see Miller and Howell, "The Myth of Neutrality in Constitutional Adjudication," 27 Univ. of Chi. L. Rev. 661 (1960). 15. See Mishkin, "Foreword: The High Court, the Great Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law," 79 Harv. L. Rev. 56 (1965), criticized in Miller and Scheflin, "The Power of the Supreme Court in the Age of the Positive State: A Preliminary Excursus," (1967), Duke L. J., 273, 522 (1967). 16. Said Warren: "We, of course, venerate the past, but our focus is on the problems of the day and of the future as far as we can foresee it." He went on to say that in one sense the Court was similar to the president, for it had the awesome responsibility of at times speaking the last word "in great governmental affairs" and of speaking for the public generally. "It is a responsibility that is made more difficult in this Court because we have no constituency. We serve no majority. We serve no minority. We serve only the public interest as we see it, guided only by the Constitution and our own consciences" (395 U.S. vii [1969]). 17. See Miller and Sastri, "Secrecy and the Supreme Court: On the Need for Piercing the Red Velour Curtain," 22 Buffalo L. Rev. 799 (1973). 18. See A. Berle, The Three Faces of Power (1967): "The danger is that . . . the Supreme Court [could become] a variety of benevolent dictator." This, he said, would eventually deaden the public to its responsibilities. But, as was Berle's wont, this tends to be hyperbole; it does not explore the complexities of the question. 19. See M. Rejai, Democracy: The Contemporary Theories (1967), for discus sion. See also, E. Schattschneider, The Semisovereign People, pp. 130-31 (1960): "The great deficiency of American democracy is intellectual, the lack of a good, usable definition." Professor Schattschneider continues: "democracy [as "government by the people"] ... is something unattainable, . . . [but] it is one of the most emotion charged words in our civilization." And see Crick, Introduction to N.</page><page sequence="36">368 ARTHUR S. MILLER Machiavelli, The Discourses, p. 27 (B. Crick, ed., 1970): ■ to call governments 'democratic' is always a misleading piece of propaganda. ... It confuses doctrine with theory: we may want the democratic element in government to grow greater, but it is still only an element while it is government at all." In the judgment of the present writer, the word "democracy" is a slogan, a symbol which helps to organize the masses. To the extent that it connotes relative freedom of the individual vis-à-vis totalitarian nations, then it has some validity; but it has little if it means participation in government. See A. S. Miller, "For Reasons of State": Machiavellianism and the American Con stitution (in process). 20. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803). Chief Justice Marshall's statement about the role of the judiciary was quoted by Chief Justice Burger in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974). 21. See the candid comments of Judge Braxton Craven of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Craven, "Paean to Pragmatism," 50 No. Car. L. Rev. 977 (1972). Judge Craven maintains, rightly in my judgment, that all judges are "result oriented," the difference among them being that some know it but others do not. Furthermore, I believe that the history of American constitutional adjudication can and should be written around the theme of the Supreme Court being "result oriented." Surely Marbury v. Madison should be analyzed in that way. 22. M. Shapiro, Law and Politics in the Supreme Court, p. 332 (1964). 23. Id. at 31. 24. Id. at 27. 25. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 531-32 (1966).

Cohen, Law and the Social Order, pp. 380-381 (1933) (collection of essays): When I first published the foregoing views [on judicial legislation] in 1914, the deans of some of our law schools wrote me that while the contention that judges do have a share in making the law is unanswerable, it is still advisable to keep the fiction of the phonograph theory to prevent the law from becoming more fluid than it already is. But I have an abiding conviction that to recognize the truth and adjust oneself to it is in the end the easiest and most advisable course. The phonograph theory has bred the mistaken view that the law is a closed, independent system having nothing to do with economic, political, social, or philo sophical science. If, however, we recognize that courts are</page><page sequence="37">Judicial Activism 369 constantly remaking the law, then it becomes of the utmost social importance that the law should be made in accordance with the best available information, which it is the object of science to supply. 26. L. Levy, Against the Law: The Nixon Court and Criminal Justice, p. xiv (1974): "My bias is in favor of well-wrought opinions that demand respect even from doubters who prefer different results. Regrettably, the judicial crusaders exert a greater influence than the judicial craftsmen. The public cares about results and has little patience for reasons." Professor Levy gives no examples of "well-wrought opinions." 27. The power of the judiciary is discussed on pp. 356-364 below. 28. Glidden v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530 (1962). 29. As Justice Douglas said in Chandler v. Judicial Council of the Tenth Circuit of the United States, 398 U.S. 74 (1970). The public, or at least the educated layman, has long known this, and lawyers so operate in their practice—when they go "judge-shopping," for example—but there is little exploration of the matter in the legal literature.

Glazer, supra note 10, at 123. Just why Professor Glazer singles out 1954 as the time that "the Court abandoned prudence" is completely mysterious, on two grounds: first, the Court had previously, in Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948), made what still could turn out to be an even more revolutionary ruling (in holding that judicial enforcement of private racial discrimination was invalid state action); and second, the Court in 1954 merely ruled on segregation in education; it took considerably more litigation for the Brown v. Board of Education principle to be extended to all areas of official action. See, for discussion and the cases, T. Emerson, D. Haber, and N. Dorsen, Political and Civil Rights in the United States (1966). 85. See L. Scarman, English Law—The New Dimension (1974); Miller, "Does Britain Need a Bill of Rights?"

Hand, "The Contribution of an Independent Judiciary to Civiliza tion," in The Spirit of Liberty: Papers and Addresses of Learned Hand, 118, 125,1. Dilliard, ed. (paper edition, 1959): It is a condition upon the success of our system that the judges should be independent; and I do not believe that their indepen dence should be impaired because of their constitutional func tion. But the price of this immunity, I insist, is that they should not have the last word in those basic conflicts of "right and wrong—between whose endless jar justice resides." You may ask what then will become of the fundamental principles of equity and fair play which our constitutions enshrine; and whether I seriously believe that unsupported they will serve merely as counsels of moderation. I do not think anyone can say what will be left of those principles; I do not know whether they will serve only as counsels; but this much I think I do know—that a society so riven that the spirit of moderation is gone, no court can save; that a society where that spirit flourishes, no court need save; that in a society which evades its responsibility by thrusting upon the courts the nurture of that spirit, that spirit in the end will perish. 88.

Since the judiciary is not a self-starter, it is obvious that half of the litigants, speaking roughly, must always be pleased by the results of</page><page sequence="42">374 ARTHUR S. MILLER the exercises of judicial power. One need not applaud everything the judges have done in recent years to say that Professor Glazer has little empirical evidence about general discontent among the American people on the conduct of the courts. See W. Watts and L. Free, State of the Nation, p. 72 (1974), indicating that, among governmental institu tions, the courts are highest in esteem of the people. 90. See Downing, "Judicial Ethics and the Political Role of Courts," 35 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. 94, 106-107 (1970): The fact that the courts are the principal forum for resolving so many important political issues is indicative of serious default on the part of our legislative and executive institutions. So long as this default continues, and the courts are responsive to pleas for resolution of such issues, the judiciary (a most fragile institution in the halls of power politics) will continue to be buffeted by the full force of increasingly devastating political conflicts arising in the nation. . . . There appears to be little prospect that the legislative and executive processes can soon be transformed in such a way as to permit our political system to cope with society's deepest problems. . . . In short, while it is very doubtful that the courts can save the country, only they may be able to buy us the time necessary for revitalization of our other institutions. In one of his last opinions, written after beset with the illness that forced his resignation, Justice Douglas said: "cases such as this one reflect festering sores in our society; and the American dream teaches that if one reaches high enough and persists there is a forum where justice is dispensed. I would lower the technical barriers and let the courts serve that ancient need. They can in time be curbed by legislative or constitutional restraints if an emergency arises. We are today far from facing an emergency. For in all frankness, no Justice of this Court need work more than four days a week to carry his burden. I have found it a comfortable burden even in my months of hospitalization" (Warth v. Seldin, 95 Sup. Ct. 2197, 2215 [1975] [dissenting opinion]).

More and more it may be seen that the latter, relatively small group is at sharp odds with the</page><page sequence="44">376 ARTHUR S. MILLER former, much larger group—which includes most blacks.
