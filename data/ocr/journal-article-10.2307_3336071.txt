<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JENNE BRONZE QUESTION FISHER- wo NSMITH, JR. It has been over four years since I dis- cussed a small corpus of Jenne bronzes in African Arts (Nesmith 1980:89-90), and in the interval new information has be- come available on the history of bronze- working in the Inland Delta of the Niger River. Archaeologists have published pertinent results of broad research and excavation. Samples of terracottas gathered from both stratified and un- stratified digging have been made known, many with scientifically deter- mined dates. These sculptures have re- vealed a north and a sharply different south delta modeling style. Some un- dated bronzes in the style of the north- ern terracottas have appeared in cata- logues, books, and journals, thus enlarg- ing the Jenne corpus. Other undated bronzes in the southern style are now known but have not yet been published. These have included the contents of a pot, the subject of this article, which yield evidence for dating to the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries. The main contents offer a unique opportunity to study the work of one craftsman who cast and hammered a wide variety of bronze objects. The known Jenne cor- pus, including small hair or necklace pendants, has tripled. What was de- scribed to me in Bamako in 1979 as le grand mystkre still remains a puzzle re- garding date and authorship, but it has certainly been reduced in scope. The archaeological data provide a glimpse of the start of bronzeworking that is based on more than local tradition and Arab narrative. Around Akjoujt in Mauritania, copper was being mined and worked by the middle of the first mil- lennium B.C., from or even before the local start of ironworking; in the Azelik and Agadez areas of Niger, copper- smelting dates go back to about 1000 and 2000 B.C. (Sutton 1982:296). In Mali, ex- cavations at Jenne-jeno reveal copper ornaments at levels dated to about A.D. 400; the copper must have come from Saharan sources and thereby gives the earliest evidence of a developed interre- gional copper trade (McIntosh 1981a:612; McIntosh 1981b:20). We have yet to find when bronzework- ing in the Inland Delta became more spe- cifically bronzecasting and when open-mold casting progressed to closed-mold casting. Among the Jenne burial bronzes examined, there are pieces twisted and hammered by hand, cast in open molds, and cast enclosed by the lost-wax technique. While it pro- vides no more than a point of perspec- tive, there is evidence of lost-wax casting at Daima, near Lake Chad, dating from A.D. 700 to 1150 (Connah 1981:173, 187). Ninth-century dates no longer seem anomalous for the Igbo-Ukwu lost-wax castings unearthed near the main Niger Delta (McIntosh 1981a:612). The earliest hard evidence of lost-wax casting in the Inland Delta is a mold fragment exca- vated near Mopti and dated to around the turn of the twelfth century (Bedaux et al. 1978:146). For decades the distinctive terracotta figures of the Inland Delta have sur- faced, through erosion or digging, from abandoned habitation mounds rising from the flood plain. The digging has been either surreptitious, leaving an un- comfortable number with no findspot, or official, yielding an increasingly useful historical record. The first official excava- tions were conducted by Captain Flore- tin, Commandant at Goundam, ninety- seven kilometers southwest of Tim- buktu, in 1896, and then by his successor, Lieutenant Desplagnes, in 1901 (De- splagnes 1903:153). Thereafter, French scholars continued to publish official ex- cavations, albeit almost all without the benefit of stratification and scientifically obtained dates. Scientific excavations were started by a team from the Univer- sity of Utrecht in 1975 and R.J. and S.K. McIntosh in 1977, the results of which may serve as the core of a future chronology of sculpture in the region. In the 1970s, the technical measurement of time slowly became enhanced by the ad- dition of the thermoluminescence dating of pottery to the radiocarbon dating of wood. In the north the most refined an- thropomorphic figures in terracotta have usually been designated "Nonanke" or "Jenne" (Guimont 1978:18; de Grunne 1980:13, 25). The findspots indicate that they come from a triangle formed by Mopti in the north and Ke Macina and Jenne in the south (de Grunne 1980:25- 27), and they have been dated by radiocarbon or thermoluminescence techniques to the fourteenth and fif- teenth centuries.' This northern style displays an elongated human head with bulging eyes, a triangular and prominent nose, and lips that in profile resemble somewhat triangular slabs set perpen- dicular to the face (de Grunne 1980:13, 14, 49, 1.28). The body is naturalistically rendered. The large number of such ter- racottas contrasts with the notably small number of comparable bronzes, which have been described as rare (Guimont 1978:14), and the record of a linkage be- tween these particular bronzes and dated strata or pottery, if any, remains unpublished at this writing. In the south a sharply different style of anthropomorphic modeling has been variously called "Bamana," "Segou," or "Bankoni," according to the location of the finds (de Grunne 1980:25,48,49). Perhaps "Proto-Bamana" is a more appropriate term.2 In these terracottas, the torso rather than head is elongated. The cylindrical head at times is hardly differentiated from the neck, and the arms and legs are cylindrical elements often without hands and feet. A variant modeling has a crude globular head as wide as the body, and no neck or shoul- ders (de Grunne 1980:1.35). The arms seem to attach directly to the head. De Grunne has published a number of Proto-Bamana terracottas with dates ranging between the fourteenth and six- teenth centuries (1980:49). With a few dates published elsewhere, the range ex- tends to the thirteenth through sixteenth centuries.3 These calculations are in- teresting for their bearing on the ages of the twenty-five known human and ani- mal bronzes in the Proto-Bamana style, and of other bronze pieces found with them.4 It seems likely that there was also bronzecasting southwest (upstream) of the trade centers of Jenne and Timbuktu, in what is now Bamana country. The technical skill equals that found in the best Jenne work, and the modeling style is both close to the terracottas and com- patible with that of the Bamana in later times. The bronze objects illustrated here were recently found buried together with nineteen bronze bracelets in a single pot. 5 The location of the site is unknown. 64</page><page sequence="2">According to one source, the pot was used to store these pieces, a use con- firmed by another source in referring to quite similar contents of other storage pots. A storage origin seems well sup- ported by the internal evidence: the pieces have not been broken, nor do they seem to have been defaced in a ritual of desanctification, as have bronzes and terracottas in many grave and cult sites of the delta. The numerous bracelets in half-round section are an eye-catching, but not exclusive, feature of Proto- Bamana terracottas (Wheeler &amp; Villarreal 1982:nos. 50, 62)), as is seen in a twelfth- fourteenth-century example from Jenne-jeno (McIntosh 1982:415).6 The duplication in other pieces suggests a craftsman's or diviner's inventory rather than grave goods from altars or personal adornment. Indeed, some of the minia- ture tools and equipment are traditional symbols of a blacksmith-bronzecaster. Among the Bamana, the blacksmith is historically a man of unique skills and power, who makes nearly all types of their sacred sculpture (McNaughton 1981:68-71). His roles include that of mas- ter diviner. To pursue the individual identification and symbolic meaning of these bronzes, one should view them in the context of both Bamana and neighboring art tradi- tions. The Bamana are the most numer- ous of the Mande group of peoples, which includes the Bozo, Soninke, Bobo, Malinke,and others (McNaughton 19- 75:intro.), most claiming an origin on the same upper reaches of the Niger River. These peoples have a common language base and share similar myths, social or- ganization, religious beliefs, and sculptural forms. The adjacent Dogon share elements of the language and major cultural traits. Originally, they probably were Mande (McNaughton 1981:3). The diminutive animal at the top of Figure 1 could well be the long-snouted, short-legged aardvark, a burrowing animal of special significance to Bamana farmers. (However, others familiar with Senufo bronze divination pieces may re- call the deliberately ill-defined quad- ruped that offers the diviner a choice of animal identities). The aardvark has a stocky body, large ears, and powerful digging claws (Zahan 1980:71-73). When startled, it digs with remarkable speed a chamber in the ground in which to hide itself. Because of its speed, strength, and underground association, it is likened to sorghum, with its fast-growing, sturdy root system to support the tall stalks. The aardvark is carved with the pangolin TOP: 1.

It has been described as an element in a classic Bougouni style but appears also at Dioila and Bamako (McNaughton 1981:195-97). In her cata- logue, Maria Kecskesi shows an example (no. 14) of an aardvark carved in wood by the Bamana (according to Zahan), and another Bamana carving (no. 15) of the aardvark type, which closely resembles the little bronze figure in the head and neck (Kecskesi 1983:25-29). The next animal in Figure 1 (second center) is a horse or more likely a donkey Even when ears are portrayed, which the tiny scale precludes here, the distinc- tion is a problem in art throughout the delta. A bronze equine of the Bozo, with legs short in relation to the body and the rider proportionally tall, is designated a donkey (Ligers 1971:fig 83). It is uncer- tain whether four fourteenth-century terracotta figures represent horses or donkeys in view of their large ears (de Grunne 1980:43-45, I. 10-13). In wood sculpture, the Dogon sometimes mount their hogon, or chief-priest, on a long- eared donkey (Laude 1973:no. 53). The equine wears a topknot in the shape of a bun or pompon. Such a pom- pon is on a waterbird, sacred to some delta peoples, that is the subject of a Jenne burial bronze pendant I examined ?, ~i~l 3. MODERN IRON STAFF, BAMANA. DETAIL 30cm., COMPLETE STAFF 63.5cm. in Bamako in 1979. The same pompon appears on the next equine in Figure 1 (third center); with its short legs and tall rider it may also be a donkey. The shortlegged animal illustrated at the bot- tom center has a pompon and, again, is perhaps a donkey. Its outline is marred by a miniature basket7 and tools that have become fused with it in storage. The horse in a Jenne equestrian woodcarv- ing, dated to the tenth-thirteenth cen- turies, also wears the pompon (Arts d'Af- rique Noire 1977:no 24, cover; and 1981:no. 31:6). This element appears as well on a bronze horse-with-standing-man pen- dant that may refer to a Dogon myth of origin (Newton 1981:50). Both the don- key and horse have special significance to such peoples as the Dogon and Bamana, but to suggest a link with a par- ticular cult would be inappropriate at this time. However, a miniature horse- man from another pot that recently be- came available for my examination has the conical back-curving hairdress of the Gwandusu cult ancestress, common in Bamana iron forgings.8 In the two remaining mounted exam- ples in Figure 1 (enlarged in Fig. 2), that a horse is represented seems clear. The animal's forelegs are almost half again longer than the hind legs so that the chest is elevated, giving the horse an alert and even aggressive look. The same stance is displayed in a woodcarving of a Bamana horse and rider from the Bou- gouni district (Goldwater 1960:no. 92), and again in another Bamana horse and rider (Schidler 1973:no. 39). Such Bamana figures appear to be concen- trated in the circles of Dioila and Bou- gouni, although they are also used elsewhere (McNaughton 1981:240). The stance occurs in a similar woodcarving of the Dogon (Laude 1973:no. 47), and in another dated to the eighteenth or early nineteenth century (Fagg 1981:129). Fi- nally, the horse in the Jenne equestrian woodcarving of the tenth-thirteenth centuries that was illustrated on the cover of Arts d'Afrique Noire has the same pose. The aggressive stance may indicate the mounted warrior, a ubiquitous sym- bol of the force and power with which societies are built and broken in West Af- rica (McNaughton 1975: field notes). The riders in Figure 2 have an elon- gated neck and torso with a head only slightly differentiated from the body. In full face and profile, they resemble, with allowance for difference in scale, two ter- racotta figures in Proto-Bamana style, one of which is dated to about the fif- teenth century (de Grunne 1980: 1.34, 1.39), and five others, including one dated to the thirteenth century (de Grunne 1982b; nos. 1,12, 23-25). All the de- tail on the terracottas is not repeated in the bronze miniatures. Some sixty simi- lar terracottas have been published; three have been dated to the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries (Wheeler &amp; Villarreal 1982:6-47; nos. 36, 50, 73). These three in turn resemble two terracottas said to be from country adja- cent to the Btamana at Bougouni and the Bani River watershed (Schidler 1973:68, no. 78; 14-15 map). Despite the small scale and surface corrosion of these bronzes, one can dis- cern the uptilted face, close-set eyes, long, thin nose, and low mouth. Mounted on horses also composed of cylindrical elements, these riders share the spare lines, tension, configuration, and the quiet elegance of the traditional ironwork of Bamana blacksmiths. Figure 3 shows such forged elegance in a Bamana mother and child. A long plait of hair rises from the back of the head, end- ing in a spearhead (out of view). The spatulate hands and other characteristics suggest a Segou origin (McNaughton 1981:312). A standing figure in iron from the Malinke of Sirakoro, 135 kilometers west of Bamako, is close in style and proportions to the bronzes (McNaughton 1975: field notes, no. 22). Figure 4, a modern Bamana piece, has the conventional Proto-Bamana up- tilted face, low mouth, and close-set eyes (repeated in the horse), but not the long, narrow nose. The rider of the second donkey(?) in Figure 1 (third center) is somewhat simi- lar to the conventional Proto-Bamana style, but the rider of the third don- key(?), with fused basket, is in the var- iant Proto-Bamana style. Although en- crustation and the photographic angle make it difficult to see here, the head is round and relatively large, as in the ter- racotta illustrated in de Grunne (1980:I. 35) and another example in Wheeler and Villarreal (1982:no. 57), and the arms are attached directly to the head. The former terracotta has Bankoni (just outside Bamako) for a findspot in Bamana coun- try. One of twelve bronze equestrian fig- ures examined from other storage pots has a rider in the variant style, in this in- stance carrying a shoulder spear. A bronze ring, relatively old, with a rider whose arms attach directly to a round head (Fig. 5) seems clearly in the same modeling tradition, and therefore is at- tributed to the present-day Bamana. Use of the variant, then, occurred possibly as late as a century ago. The rider sits in an unusually high Arab saddle, like one found in a much larger Bamana wood sculpture of the same subject (Schiidler 1973: 42, no. 39). Although some be- lieve the round head has been somewhat worn away through use, it also brings to mind the warrior's cap like those found on some modern Senufo bronze eques- trians. This bronze horse and rider is interest- ing for the complex genealogy of its modeling style. Called Dogon by the trade some years ago, it has a tiny raised 66</page><page sequence="4">t *saw 4. BRONZE RING. BAMANA(?), 5.8cm. 97 7a:* 5. BRONZE RING. BAMANA, 5cm. oval/circle representing a saddle ele- ment, directly below the rider on the flank, which is related to a device appear- ing on another bronze horse and rider recently published and also attributed to the Dogon (Brincard 1982:A9). In the lat- ter, the circle outlines a hole for suspen- sion that passes through the rib cage of the horse, as in two bronze bulls in Fig- ure 7. The flap-like legs and the rumps of both horses are like those of the bulls, and flap-like, schematic arms of the rid- ers are also seen in Figure 1 (third center). Although both horsemen have the same rounded head or cap, the long and awk- ward neck of that published by Brincard is closer to the conventional than to the variant neckless Proto-Bamana style. The muzzle of the first horse is pointed like the beak of a bird; that of the second is longer and open, butit too is bird-like. In turn, this open bird-beak muzzle is related to the open bird-beak muzzles of bronze horses on Soninke/Malinke chiefs' staffs (sono) published recently (Bassani 1979: figs. 1,3; Brincard 1982:E1-E3). These riders and other tig- ures differ greatly from Figure 5 in points of style, though all share some conven- tional or variant Proto-Bamana similarities, such as long necks, flap-like arms, vestigial legs, high Arab saddles, and heavy chest straps on the horses. In 1979, I was told by a senior Saracole (Soninke) source that there is no knowl- edge or tradition of Soninke bronzecast- ing in Mali. It now appears that the Soninke rulers and smiths of the Empire of Ghana had a pre-Islamic and now for- gotten bronze modeling style, surviving in part among these bronzes, which in- fluenced other Mande groups; or that Soninke, Malinke, Bozo, Dogon, and Bamana, with local differences, drew upon a yet earlier and undefined savanna model. A Bamana example in iron, from Bougouni, with the Soninke bird-beak muzzle has been published (d'Udekem &amp; Klobe 1977:fig. 4). The three human shapes in Figure 7 are seen enlarged in Figure 8, set tem- porarily in day so that they will stand up- right. They were perhaps made to be sewn to clothing or to be used in divina- tion.9 The sculpture on the left has a head with miniscule features like those of the fifteenth-century terracotta illus- trated in de Grunne (1980:1.34). The sculptures in the center and at right have a simple conical and almost undiffer- entiated head topping the elongated neck. A fourteenth-century terracotta from the Bougouni region, of a woman with a similar head, has been published (de Grunne 1982a:no. 24), and the same configuration is found in another publi- cation (Wheeler &amp; Villarreall982:nos. 16, 17). Such dates should be regarded as no more than measured but loose approximations. The second and third of these minia- tures could represent a human or mythi- cal figure, but the first, cast with one arm missing, needs further reference to Mande myth. We are told that the Bamana, Dogon, Bozo, Sarakole, Malinke, and others know and use, with local variation in detail, a basic myth in which the blacksmith descended from heaven, establishing a unique role as leader, instructor, and maker of sacred and secular objects used in everyday life (Dieterlen 1973:53, 59). In a Dogon expli- cation, the smith came down with Yasa, female twin of Nommo, who is entrusted with the care of the universe (Dieterlen 1973:43, 48-50). He amputated one of her arms to make his hammer, and a hand to make a pair of pincers. Before beginning work, a Dogon smith knocks his anvil three times with his hammer, once in apology to Yasa. The oldest blacksmith in a territory maintains a shrine that in- cludes a wood statue with one arm mis- sing, which represents Yasa. An apparent iron example from Bougouni also exists (d'Udekem &amp; Klobe 1977:no. 2). It is clear that the pair of bronze ani- mals in Figure 7, pierced for suspension, are bulls. There were two breeds of bovine at Jenne fifty years ago, the 67</page><page sequence="5">humped zebu and straight-backed bam- bara. The bronzes fit a long description of the latter in main details (Monteil 1932:216, 217). Such cattle go far back in local history. The excavations at Jenne- jeno revealed bones of a small bovine in every phase, that is, from circa 250 B.C. to circa A.D. 1400 (McIntosh 1979:233, 235). Because bronze was a sacred metal, the bulls probably have a symbolic mean- ing that is as yet unknown; a bovine head appears among Jenne bronze animal pendants forming a large necklace (de Grunne 1980:46, 1.33). The bulls were modeled over a clay core, which left a narrow cavity in the underside not seen in side view, a technical feature in small castings that implies a marked shortage of copper and its alloys. The miniaturization of a blacksmith's tools, such as those displayed in Figure 7, and the yet smaller utensils shown with the basket accompanying the equestrian bronze at the bottom of Fig- ure 1, is well documented among Mande peoples. The smith's mystic tie to the Earth and consequent power pass to his tools and equipment. Bamana smiths make miniature bronze spirals, ham- mers, and sandals for amulets, with slave shackles and blacksmith's pincers prefabricated for sale in the open market (McNaughton 1981:x, 146,151). The pin- cers (balan) attached to a Bamana necklace is a symbol of the smith's power (McNaughton 1975: field notes, no. 27). Nearby Minianka (like others as far away as the Yoruba) make miniature tools in bronze or iron for use as ritual instru- ments (Jonckers 1979:117). Pincers of bronze (or iron) are used to attract favors such as good hunting, and Bozo fisher- AA% 6. BRONZE BELL AND BRACELET. 5.2cm, 8 cm. men on the banks of the Niger use them as protection against specific harms (Daget &amp; Konipo 1951:81). Blacksmith pincers are represented on a Jenne ter- racotta woman dated to the thirteenth century (de Grunne 1980:I. 15). The tools and other equipment in Fig- ures 7 and 1 in part illustrate the blacksmith's focal position in Mande so- ciety. The axe suggests weaponry and his carving of sacred wood sculptures, the adze also suggests carving, and the spoon, perhaps household activity. The pincers, in addition to having signifi- cance as talismans, may represent the handling of hot metal or dangerous medicines. In Figure 1, the basket melded to the equestrian contains im- plements fused within it: a hoe-blade with a tang, a shovel blade with a socket-both agricultural tools-and a flat disc or spatula with a long handle for handling hot breadstuffs. 10 Separate is a sword or knife blade with a tang, the blade bent accidentally to a 450 angle; it is possi- bly a weapon or the smith's woodcarving knife. In this group the tanged instru- ments were hammered rather than cast, and a recently broken tip of a tang shows copper or a high-copper alloy as the metal used. The variety of implements would seem applicable to many of the situations encountered by a Bamana blacksmith-diviner. The last of the storage-pot contents to be considered here, a full-scale bell and bracelet (Fig. 6), may not be by the same hand. Of a size often used by diviners, the bell has a double suspension ring, a raised line around its junction with the conical body, and a double line around the base, above which is a row of six (2 x 3) three-sided perforations. The Dogon today use a symbolic count of 3 to depict the male principle, and 4 (or a circular shape) for the female (Nesmith 1979:22 et seq.). The Bamana use the same number symbolism (Zahan 1974:7). While the symbolism should be noted, it does not necessarily apply to the detail on this bell. Moreover, similar terracottas lately exhibited (Wheeler &amp; Villarreal 1982) re- veal symbolism in which 4 represents the male and 3 the female principle." At the top of the cone, the bell encloses a lump of iron, visible in an X ray, that does not appear to be part of a missing clapper. The Minianka often attach a piece of "red copper" to "black" iron, or vice versa, to enhance the "force" in the smith's equipment used for ritual (Jonckers 1979:115-17). The bracelet is semicircular in section and hollow cast. Its only or- nament is an area on the outer hoop marked with tightly spaced transverse lines. A similar bracelet from another pot has a more ornate combination of geometric designs, like those on the chest of the iron mother in Figure 3. The miniature pieces in the storage pot are notable for their refined modeling and the technical skill required to cast them. Despite their heavy coat of verdi- gris, it is apparent that the blacksmith worked with a patient eye for delicate de- tail and that he used unusually fine clays for the investment. Indeed, those who have handled the small ninth-century bronze pendant from Igbo-Ukwu, which de- picts a human head, at the Museum of Mankind in London will recognize a comparable jewel-like quality. As is too often the case in the delta, the miniatures' findspot is uncertain. Four out of six sources-experienced Ameri- can, European, and African dealers and collectors-give the Mopti-Ke Macina- Jenne triangle as the location and regard the style as Jenne. One names Dialloube, a district eighty kilometers north of Mopti, in what some French maps define as "Le Pays de Jenne." A French ethnic map shows Bamana settled at the loca- tion of Dialloube (Pacques 1954: Carte des Populations). Both locations seem based on second- and third-hand information, however. Some data presented here may be used to support the Jenne attribution. Bracelets associated with the miniatures appear on a Jenne terracotta, and the pompon seems a prominent feature of Jenne animal imagery. We have a Jenne horse in wood with overlong forelegs like Bamana and Dogon examples. In a city founded by Soninke traders in the third century B.C. (McIntosh 1982:414), it is possible that a local blacksmith cast bronzes for export to groups in the trad- ing area, such as the Dogon or Bamana. Most pieces in the pot bear traces of sandy delta soil indicating a riverine (and Jenne) rather than savannah findspot. On the other hand, the miniatures as a whole reveal a close and coherent view of presumably non-Islamic work in the different plastic style of a people just south of the triangle. Both mounted and standing human figures resemble the ancient Proto-Bamana terracottas and some later Bamana metal figures. While the iconography, including twenty equestrian figures among thirty-one known miniature figures executed in the round, cannot be linked as yet to a par- ticular cult, it is not incompatible, for example, with that of the Gwandusu mounted ancestress, which the Bamana forge in iron. The types of tool portrayed in miniature would appear rather useless to Bozo fishermen or Nono rice planters working the low watery spots of the del- ta. Moreover, Bamana wood and iron equestrian figures, some southern ter- racottas, a bronze aardvark(?), and the Minianka practice of enclosing iron in a bronze casting raise the possibility of a link between these bronzes and the Bou- gouni district. A considerable tonnage of high-quality iron ore was extracted from the mines around the town of Bougouni (McNaughton 1981:101-2). Of all the 68</page><page sequence="6">Bamana ironworking centers, this one is described as "a veritable birthplace of blacksmiths" (Pacques 1954:104). Al- though this does not necessarily mean that Bougouni was also a bronzeworking center, an ancient burial bronze has been found in the vicinity. Perhaps the most telling piece of evi- dence of both findspot and date rests in the traces of sandy delta soil. The rep- resentation of tools and portrayal of what may be an aardvark indicate a pos- sible link between these small bronzes and the millet- and sorghum-growing Bamana farmers. We are told by ar- chaeologists that, first, all the settle- ments in the sandy upland soils of the delta favored by millet and sorghum cul- tivators appear to postdate Phase IV at Jenne-jeno or, as one may infer, about A.D. 1400; and second, as documented in Arab writing, the settlement of the re- gion by slowly migrating Bamana may have started early in the thirteenth cen- tury, but reached a maximum penetra- tion in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (McIntosh 1979:238, 240). The Arab official al-Sa'di (1596-1656?), resid- ing in Jenne and Timbuktu, stated that the Bamana were present near Jenne in great numbers in the mid-sixteenth cen- tury, sacking it near the turn, and obtain- ing full control of their territory during the mid-seventeenth century (al-Sa'di 1900, vol. 2:172, 223, 411). It is reasonable to suppose that the Bamana arriving in the Jenne vicinity in the thirteenth-seventeenth centuries would cast in the Proto-Bamana style, for which there are terracotta dates of the thirteenth-sixteenth centuries. A concentration of dates in the fourteenth-sixteenth centuries com- pares with penetration, which reached large numbers in the sixteenth century. The human heads on the bronzes are cer- tainly not in the common Bamana sculptural style of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, despite the excep- tions noted; similar terracottas lately exhibited (Wheeler &amp; Villarreal 1982) re- veal number symbolism in which 4 rep- resents the male and 3 the female princi- ple, rather than the reverse as has re- cently been widely attested. The heads do not fit the plastic style of the Bozo as recorded by Ligers (1971) or that of the Dogon as illustrated by Laude (1973). While the Proto-Bamana dates rest upon a frail statistical base, we have neverthe- less a convergence of archaeologic, his- toric, and ethnographic material that may confirm a Jenne findspot and what we may well describe as an approach to fifteenth-sixteenth-century bronze dates.

Roy Sieber examined the bronzes, read the manuscript, and offered valuable comments. This article covers miniatures only; the other bronzes of the In- land Delta and small necklace pendants will be covered at a future date. 1. In a broader tabulation of thirty-seven northern ter- racotta dates in four publications, the style is indeed con- centrated in the fourteenth-fifteenth centuries, but its range statistically is the twelfth-seventeenth centuries, giv- ing a record of over five hundred years in use. Such a span without convergent data is too wide to help much in dating similar bronzes. The dates appear in de Grunne (1980, 1982a, 1982b), and Wheeler and Villarreal (1982), supplied privately by letter after publication. In addition, fifteen such dates were supplied for the exhibit "Djenne Terracot- tas: The Prehistoric Sculpture of Mali," James Willis Gal- lery, San Francisco, May 3-June 30, 1983 (no catalogue). 2. At this juncture none of the three former names seems quite suitable. The known findspots of bronze, iron, and terracotta work reveal a style area reaching south of the true delta and somewhat beyond bounds now marking the Bamana, who may or may not represent the indigenous Mande group. A similarity between known Malinke and Bamana modeling styles is disconcerting. However, in the present state of our ignorance, the term "Proto-Bamana" is selected to reflect the fact that an ancient terracotta tradi- tion is found concentrated in present Bamana country, with enough stylistic evidence to suggest a connection with later Bamana plastic art. A sequel to this study is planned that will include, in contrast, a group of ancient and modern bronzes in the Malinke style. 3. Dates for nine southern terracottas in four publications range from the thirteenth through the sixteenth centuries, or four hundred years, but they are concentrated in the fourteenth and fifteenth. The statistical base is too small to suggest more than a possible direction of data when and if more become available. The dates appear in de Grunne 1980, 1982a, 1982b, and in Wheeler and Villarreal 1982. In addition, three more dates were made available during the 1983 Willis Gallery exhibit. 4. At time of writing, the twenty-five known figurative bronzes (all from pots) in the Proto-Bamana style are dis- tributed as follows: four in Africa, four in Europe, and sev- enteen in the United States. I examined twenty-one of these for this study together with sixteen associated pieces, of which eight are probably by the same hand. The thirty- seven examined have a convincing patina that suggests con- siderable age; where fractured, the metal surface shows signs of heavy decay 5. These figures first came to my attention in the U.S. art market, where it was recognized that they were old and from Jenne country, but otherwise without precedent and meaning. A few similar pieces appeared somewhat later in Europe. 6. This unpublished dating has been supplied to me by R.J. McIntosh, who requests that it be viewed with caution, being new and unseasoned by time. 7. Roy Sieber persuasively points out that given the scale of the tools, their container is more logically a basket than a crucible, as was first thought. 8. I am grateful to Dr. Sieber for spotting the Bamana re- semblance in this smallest (ca. 2.5 cm.) of all equestrians so far encountered. 9. In modern times (ca. 1950), the warrior theme has been expressed by a squatting bronze figure with a spear, mod- eled in the Jenne style and used for divination, according to a Mali source with first-hand information. The piece is de- signed to topple unless propped up with pebbles, suggest- ing similar use for other bronzes not intended to hang or to stand free, such as the human figures in Figures 7 and 8. Bamana smiths are master diviners (McNaughton 1979:69). 10. Two photos of this type of spatula in modern use in Timbuktu are published in Au coeur du Mali (Commissariat au Tourisme du Mali, Bamako, n.d., pp. 10, 11). 11. Of eighty-seven terracottas from present Bamana coun- try that I examined-not all illustrated-fifteen have number counts of 4 for male in their plastic detail, as occurs among the Mande-speaking Vai on the coast of Liberia. The Mande peoples apparently once had an earlier number symbolism than that now in the Niger Bend. I am grateful to the Honorable Bai T. Moore, a Vai, for introducing me to the male 4 in his sector of the Guinea Coast in 1978. Bibliography al-Sa'di, Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Abd Allah. 1898-1900. Tarikh al-Sudan. Translation by Octave V.
