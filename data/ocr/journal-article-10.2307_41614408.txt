<plain_text><page sequence="1">Volume IH, No.3 The BRITISH ART Journal Landseer and the lion-tamer The ' Portrait of Mr. Van Amburgh ' at Yale Stephen Duffy A years popular lion-tamer of the figure called reign on of the Isaac Queen London Van Victoria Amburgh stage was in an the (1800-68). American earliest years of the reign of Queen Victoria was an American lion-tamer called Isaac Van Amburgh (1800-68). Known as 'Van Amburgh the Brute Tamer', his performances at Drury Lane and Astley's Amphitheatre drew large audiences and won the enthusiastic admiration of the young Queen herself. In little more than a month, between 10 January and 12 February 1839, she made as many as six visits to Drury Lane to see him perform, and on one occasion stayed behind after the show to watch the animals being fed.1 'One can never see it too often,' she wrote in her Journal for 29 January 1839. 'Van Amburgh... has great power over the animals, &amp; they seem to love him, though I think they are in great fear of him. He took them by their paws, throwing them down &amp; making them roar, &amp; he lay upon them after enraging them.'2 With barely a moment's delay, Victoria commissioned a painting of Van Amburgh and his animals (PI 1) from Edwin Landseer, who had been firmly established for more than a decade as the most fashionable animal painter of his time. By early 1839 he had already painted her favourite dogs and he had recently embarked on a full-scale portrait of the new Queen on horseback. Although she had soon learnt that he was stubborn and that he could also be irritatingly slow, he worked on this commission to paint Van Amburgh with alacrity. On 23 February 1839 the Queen was shown, at Buckingham Palace, in the artist's presence, 'a most beautiful picture Landseer is doing of the Lions; it is perfection; Van Amburg (who has not yet sat) lying on the ground holding the Tiger by the head who is roaring - and one could fancy one heard it; the large Lion lying behind him, the other Lion growling at him, the panther reclining his head in his lap, and another leopard looking out, with the Lamb leaning against the man's breast; it is quite beautiful, like nature, and you are supposed to be inside the cage'.3 On 2 March the Queen noted that the picture 'had greatly got on'.4 TWo months later it was finished and hanging in the Royal Academy's exhibition. 'Most beautiful', she enthused, '...a wonderful piece of painting. . . just exactly as I saw him.'5 Although it was already acknowledged that dogs were Landseer's particular forte, some of the 'big cats' were almost as familiar to him. His earliest drawings had included lions and tigers sketched at the Tower of London and at Exeter 'Change in the Strand. As a boy he had even dissected the carcass of a lion presented to him and his friend Thomas Christmas by the owner of Cross's menagerie at Exeter 'Change. In 1823 he contributed five designs to Tiuenty Engravings of Lions, Tigers , Panthers and Leopards , a publication combining natural history with anecdote, written by John Landseer, Edwin's father, and illustrated with engravings by Edwin's brother Tom.6 Van Amburgh and his animals , like many of Landseer's paintings, is more than simply a portrait or an animal study. The subject of a man with lions inevitably evokes the biblical 25 1 Van Amburgh and his animals by Edwin Landseer (1802?-73), 1839. 113 x 174.6 cm, Oil on canvas, The Royal Collection © 2001, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II</page><page sequence="2">The BRITISH ART Journal Volume III, No.3 story of Daniel in the lions' den. Indeed, not only was this a reference familiar to probably every member of Van Amburgh's audience, it was also the inspiration for the lion- tamer's act, according to his manager. In his Biographical Sketch of I. A VanAmburgh 'H. Frost' wrote: It was that remarkable and wonderful episode in Biblical history, found in the sixth chapter of Daniel, that induced Mr. Van Amburgh to contemplate the possibility of subduing the whole animal kingdom; and, while pondering over the escape of Daniel from the Lion's Den, he conceived that the age of miracles had not expired, and at once resolved to solve the problem.7 Man's innate superiority to animals and his right to govern the earth, a distasteful notion to most modern sensibilities, was questioned by few Victorians, and the moral value of Van Amburgh's act as a demonstration of Man's God-given authority over all other creatures was repeatedly emphasised by his admirers.8 Although the presence of scratches on his neck and right arm in Landseer's painting might suggest that such authority was not unchallenged, there could be no better proof of Van Amburgh's power (and by extension that of the rest of humanity) than the relaxed manner in which he reclines in the cage guarding the lamb. 'This lamb, a regular feature of Van Amburgh's performances, was a deliberate evocation of another biblical text: 'The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fading together; and a little child shall lead them' ( Isaiah 11:6). When a mezzotint after the painting was published, nearly 40 years later, in 1878, it was given the tide Dominion , lest anyone should mistake its moral and religious message.9 As well as the Queen, Van Amburgh's eminent admirers also included the Duke of Wellington. According to Frost, the Duke came twice to see Van Amburgh perform and 'held a conference of full half an hour each time with our modern Lysimacus'.10 In May 1841, during a visit to the Duke's country estate at Stratfìeld Saye, the painter George Hayter recorded in his diary in excruciating syntax that the Duke had told him: There are two subjects [one was the Duke's entry into Madrid during the Peninsular War] which out [sic] to be painted &amp; I should like to see it done well. I think the one a great moral lesson, we are informed that all the animals of the creation were created for our use; but we don't know how to reduce some of them to obedience. The Lyon, the Royal tiger, the Hyena &amp; others, but Van Ambourg has effected this, what I want Landseer to paint for me is Van Ambourg. He is a fine athletic man, surrounded by the animals he has so well known, not only how to render obedient to himself but also to live in peace with each other. Van A standing upright a fine figure of a man, with these animals lying round him, and the lamb at his feet for he places the lamb between the Lyon &amp; the Tiger and they dare not touch it. This is not all, you see in an adjoining cage these ferocious beasts together not injuring each other, this is education, this is the great moral lesson, then he lamented that Edwin Landseer's health had not permitted him to paint this picture for him, and repeated the description of Van A's prowess.11 Presumably Wellington had commissioned the painting in 1839, when he and the Queen had been so impressed by Van Amburgh's performances. Unlike the Queen, however, the Duke had to endure a long wait before his picture was completed. It was probably not until the late summer of 1846 that Landseer began work on it in earnest, and it was not until March 1847 - after he may have received some help from another artist - that it was finally finished in a form rather different from that described to Hayter.12 Titled 26 ' Portrait of Mr. Van Amburgh, as he appeared with his Animals at the London Theatres' (PI 2), it was exhibited at the 1847 Royal Academy exhibition where its reception by the critics was kind, but seldom leavened by much enthusiasm. The Art-Union , for example, thought that it offered 'no scope for [the] imagination', though it applauded the power of the composition and the intensity of the eyes of the lioness.13 The Duke himself, however, was quite as pleased with his picture as the Queen had been with hers. In payment he sent Landseer a cheque for one thousand pounds, though the fee had originally been agreed at half that sum.14 He suggested that the painting should be engraved,15 and he hung it in a prominent position opposite a portrait of his great predecessor the Duke of Marlborough in the Piccadilly Drawing Room of his London home, Apsley House.16 Although it was later moved to the library after Wellington's death, it remained at Apsley House until in the middle of the last century it was relegated to a damp and draughty out- building at Stratfìeld Saye, a victim of the disdain for Victorian art which was prevalent at that time. Sold in deplorable condition at auction in 1975 and later restored, it was bought in 1977 by Paul Mellon and given by him in the same year to the Yale Center for British Art.17 As he had indicated to Hayter, the Duke regarded his painting above all as an illustration of Man's dominion over the natural world. No doubt he admired the lion-tamer's courage, but it was the religious significance of Van Amburgh's act which made the deepest impression on him. According to Algernon Graves, Landseer told the Duke's son that his father had called the portrait 'his sacred subject',18 and to this day it retains its original frame with an ornamental cartouche, added by the Duke, inscribed with lines from the first chapter of Genesis, proclaiming Man's 'dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth'.19 The Duke bought relatively few works by contemporary artists, preferring the Old Masters (especially seventeenth-century Dutch pictures), and almost all his modern paintings had subjects connected with his family or his public life.20 As a man of no military or political standing, Van Amburgh was exceptionally honoured by Wellington's request for his portrait. It is clear that the Duke saw him as much more than just a brave and entertaining stage performer. For the second portrait Landseer probably relied in part on studies made for the first - there is no record of any further sittings by Van Amburgh - and in both pictures the number and sex of the big cats (a lion, a lioness, a tiger and two leopards or cheetahs) are the same.21 But, as is obvious from even a cursory glance, the two are very different in composition and character. In the Duke's (much larger) painting Van Amburgh is shown as an erect and commanding figure, and the lamb is omitted, despite the Duke's original wish for it to be at Van Amburgh's feet between the lion and the tiger. The viewer is also now located outside rather than inside the cage - a feature of her own painting which the Queen had particularly noted - and the animals appear far more humanised than they had been before. It is important, however, to establish at once that in the 19th century these animals were judged to be remarkably true to life. 'The animals are marvellously truthful and express obedience to the extended arm in every variety of position and of look,' wrote a reviewer of the Royal Academy exhibition in The Athenaeum ; and The Times , when referring to the lion in the corner, which with its extraordinary pose and Expression might seem to us to be merely feigning submission, said only</page><page sequence="3">Volume III, No.3 The BRITISH ART Journal that it was 'given to the life'.22 'Landseer never painted animal portraiture more naturally and beautifully than in this composition', added The Art Journal in 1879.23 Although the Victorians could accept animals with anthropomorphic features as entirely natural, there is no evidence from contemporary sources that Landseer intended the animals in the Yale portrait to express distinctively human emotions. The Duke of Wellington himself had been concerned to see that the animals were represented convincingly. According to the Quarterly Review , when Landseer showed him some of his sketches he was told, 'Very fine, I daresay, but not what I want;' and an equally cool hint [from the Duke] struck out a most picturesquely placed panther: 'No - that's a taught trick' [he said].24 Presumably the Duke regarded the final result as entirely naturalistic. It was the figure of Van Amburgh, not the animals, which was criticised as forced and unconvincing. 'The expressions conveyed by the actions and heads of the beasts better denote their subjection to a superior power than does the figure of Van Amburgh his dominion', wrote The Athenaeum , though it went on to blame Van Amburgh rather than Landseer for this failing: 'The deficiency is not that of the painter - it is that of the lion-tamer himself. The theatrical figure, truly rendered, suggests no idea of the moral power exercised by man over the brute race. Here is no lord of the creation.'25 In heterogeneous, the Queen's audience picture the seems meagre, to respond but remarkably to Van heterogeneous, audience seems to respond to Van Amburgh with curiosity but very little enthusiasm or admiration. In the Yale portrait, on the other hand, the objects in the foreground suggest an intense but ambivalent response. Landseer often used objects as signs to suggest a person relevant to the narrative but not actually seen in the painting. Perhaps the best-known examples are the Bible and the spectacles of the dead shepherd in The old shepherd's chief mourner (by 1837; Victoria and Albert Museum, London). The use of objects as signs in this way would have been familiar to him from the art of Hogarth (to mention only the most renowned English precedent), but even Hogarth did not use objects for this purpose with more invention than Landseer.26 In Portrait of Mr. Van Amburgh he elaborates this device to suggest, not a person or persons outside and probably unaware of what is happening in the scene shown in the painting, but the presence of an audience actually looking at the principal part of that scene (Van Amburgh and his animals in the cage). The objects complement the pose which Van Amburgh has adopted to impress a watching audience as well as to intimidate his animals. In the history of portraiture this use of symbols is an exceptional means of emphasising the process of looking and responding, very different from the traditional expedients of pointing fingers or having the sitter gaze directly at the viewer. It is fully in accord with the increased importance of sight in relation to the other senses which has been identified as characteristic of the modernity of the 19th century.27 The objects which indicate the presence of the audience comprise a bouquet of flowers, a laurel wreath, two pieces of orange peel and a torn playbill. Arrayed across the foreground of the painting, they comment on Van Amburgh just as similarly placed still-lifes comment on the figures in some religious and genre scenes painted in the Low Countries between the 15th and 17th centuries.28 Although 27 2 ' Portrait of Mr. Van Amburgh, as he appeared with his Animals at the London Theatres' by Edwin Landseer, cl846-7.

The playbill, however, is more complex. It refers to Van Amburgh, but it also teases, with rather leaden humour, another of the leading stage characters of the day, Landseer's friend William Macready (1793-1873), the great classical actor. Macready, a redoubtable champion of the traditional theatre, had been outraged by the lion-tamer's appearances at Drury Lane eight years earlier.29 In his diary he had berated the newspapers for lauding the trash' of Van Amburgh, and ruefully noted many of the Queen's visits to see him perform. 'Saw the Court Journal', he had written on 2 February 1839, 'which contains a wretched piece of trash, justifying the Queen's patronage of Mr. Van Amburgh.'30 In 1836 he had even had a fist-fight with Alfred Bunn, the manager of Drury Lane, because Bunn, desperate to bring in audiences and ever willing to stage vulgar shows like animal spectaculars, had cut Richard III to just its first three acts in order to make it more acceptable to popular taste.31 In Landseer's picture the playbill advertises Van Amburgh in 'positively his last appearance on this stage' as the main attraction, followed by Macready and his company in another of Shakespeare's plays - The Taming of the Shrewd2 28 Whether the Duke of Wellington approved of this pleasantry remains a matter of speculation. According to the Quarterly Review (which in 1853 published an article on Apsley House peppered with anecdotes which are hard to ignore but also sometimes impossible to verify), the Yale portrait was painted 'after the positive instructions of the Duke', but it is not clear from this or any other source what was the extent of his involvement.33 Although it is hard to imagine that he could fail to notice the playbill - as a devotee of the theatre, traditional as well as sensational, he may even have enjoyed the joke - it fits so oddly with his perception of the picture's religious message that one might wonder if he was even aware of it.34 Only one contemporary review - that in The Examiner which condemned 'the play-bill with its stale jokes in one corner of the fore-ground'35 - made any reference to Landseer's witticism. In planning his picture Landseer turned to famous paintings by Rubens and by Jacques-Louis David. The lions around Daniel in Rubens's Daniel in the lions' den (PI 3), which in Landseer's time was in the collection of the Duke of Hamilton, seem to have influenced the pose or placement of as many as four of the animals in Van Amburgh's portrait, notably the tiger which in its stance almost mirrors that of the snarling lioness to the right of Daniel. As for the influence of David, that can be seen immediately if Landseer's picture is compared with The oath of the Horatii (PI 4). In a similarly claustrophobic setting with an arched background, Van Amburgh stands like the Horatii brothers, his gesture of command directed towards the cringing lion and lioness which take the place of Camilla and Sabina, the Horatii's swooning womenfolk. Even the boards on which Van Amburgh stands echo some of the lines of the paving in David's picture. Nor is this perhaps the only reference to the French master: the pose of Van Amburgh also has similarities to that of Tatius in The intervention of the Sabine women (PI 6). Both David's paintings could have been seen by Landseer in the Louvre when he paid his first visit to Paris in 1840, but (like Rubens's Daniel) they must also have been familiar to him from reproductive prints.36 Landseer was presumably drawn to David's Roman scenes by the vaguely Roman costume which Van Amburgh wore in order to evoke gladiatorial associations in the minds of his audience. The poses struck by the lion-tamer, ironically similar to those of actors in the traditional theatre, would also have been perfectly at home in the language of expression and gesture which had been the foundation of Neoclassical history painting. There are few more potent images of heroism and masculine vigour than The oath of the Horatii , and we know from Hayter that the Duke of Wellington admired Van Amburgh as 'a fine figure of a man'. In turning to David for the stance of the lion-tamer, Landseer may also have had in mind Sir Joshua Reynolds's practice of deriving a sitter'^ pose from a renowned work of art in order to dignify the composition. 3 Daniel in the lions' den by Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640), cl6l5.

It is difficult, however, to find any thematic link between the portrait of an American lion-tamer and The oath of the Horatii , David's glorification of self-sacrifice for the good of the state. Moreover, if we look at David's reputation in Britain and the historical associations of his most famous painting it soon becomes apparent that Landseer chose a surprising compositional model for a portrait intended for the Duke of Wellington. David's historical pictures were reasonably well-known in England in the early 19th century.37 Even those unable to visit Paris had several opportunities to see versions of his compositions on display in London after 1815. But, although the British were curious to see what David had painted, their verdict was usually far from flattering. Throughout the century few British art lovers would have quarrelled with Hazlitt's assertion that the paintings of David and his followers were 'repulsive to the senses and cold to the heart'.38 Landseer's own teacher, Benjamin Robert Haydon, although a tireless champion of historical painting, was equally contemptuous, asserting that it had been the Napoleonic wars that had allowed England to escape 'the contagion of David's Brick dust which infected the Continent... ', and naming the Sabine Women among those works which demonstrated 'irrefutably' that French artists were 'floundering in the bye paths of Art, though their own conceit and their own ineffable elevation of head is so high'.39 Although there was often respect for French draughtsmanship, the British response to David was almost invariably hostile and its tenor remarkably consistent: his history paintings (and French neo-classical pictures generally) were austere to the point of frigidity and their figures were like statues translated into paint. They were also unimaginative and unnatural: '[The French] style of art is false from beginning to end', wrote Hazlitt, 'nor is it redeemed even by the vices of genius, originality, and splendour of appearance.'40 There was also an overt political dimension to much British criticism. For some (though not Hazlitt who was an admirer of Napoleon), David's domination of French historical painting had been analogous to the tyranny imposed on France itself by his political master, and he was even more notorious as the painter who had played a leading role in the Revolution and voted for the death of the King.41 Moreover, of all his historical paintings, few were more closely associated with the Revolution than The oath of the Horatii. Modern historians have endlessly debated whether it prefigured the events which broke out four years after it was first exhibited, but there can be no doubt that it became a template for republican symbolism. It was frequently invoked in prints and medals celebrating revolutionary fraternity, and it was David himself who in 1794 organised the Festival of the Supreme Being at which 'the altar to the fatherland' was decorated with a frieze derived from his masterpiece.42 Despite these associations, there was, however, perhaps a precedent for Landseer's use of The oath of the Horatii in a painting which was already in the Duke's collection. As David Blayney Brown has recently revealed, the most celebrated of the Duke's modern pictures, Wilkie's Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch (PI 5), painted for Wellington in 1818-22, has a compositional structure 6 The intervention of the Sabine women (detail) by Jacques-Louis David, 1799. Oil on canvas, 385 x 522 cm, Paris, Musée du Louvre. Photo RMN which 'at times seems more than coincidentally parallel to' that of David's painting. The rider's legs, straddling his horse, echo [those of] the Horatii; the white sheet of the dispatch has the same focal impact as their swords; the old seated Pensioner who receives its content with equanimity, as if nothing else could properly be expected, is the counterpart of the brothers' father; the group of women and children on the right substitute their joy for the Roman women's fear; and behind them all, the arching trees close off the background like David's row of columns.43 One might also add that, though their characters are utterly different, Wilkie's white-shirted Irishman and the stupified Pensioner to whom he explains the news have undeniable similarities of pose and placement to David's Camilla and Sabina. 29</page><page sequence="6">The BRITISH ART Journal Volume III, No.3 7 Detail of [WM Thackeray] The Paris Sketch Book: by Mr. Tïtmarsh (London, 1840), vol I, p 106 The case is not proven and Dr Brown is appropriately circumspect about his brilliant observation, but it is difficult to dismiss it out of hand. It might also be noted that The oath of the Horatiïs theme of selfless devotion to the state (and its possible conflict with familial loyalties) would have been entirely relevant to Wilkie's old soldiers. But, on the other hand, Wilkie seems to have fully shared his countrymen's prejudices against contemporary French painting. During his visit to Paris with Haydon in 1814 he condemned David's 'badly coloured compositions' and remarked of French artists in general: 'Their compositions are without taste, their expressions without dignity, and theatrical; and if anyone were to except their power of drawing the figures, I do not know what would be left to recommend them.'44 For his friend and biographer Allan Cunningham, Wilkie was nothing less than the hero of a 'Protestant-independent' manner of painting which was the utter antithesis of the 'unnatural' and rigidly structured art which was associated in British minds with David and the French Academy.45 If Wilkie did make use of The oath of the Horatii , it is impossible to believe that by doing so he intended any slight upon the Duke of Wellington or his soldiers. As Wilkie himself wrote to Haydon, 'With respect to the commission, I felt in the highest degree proud of it,'46 and his recorded comments on the Duke convey the deepest admiration for him. Moreover, it was quite possible for some Britons to ignore David's political career. Wilkie himself made no reference to it in his published journals and neither did Haydon. George IV even owned a clock adorned with gilt- bronze figures adapted from The oath of the Horatii , as well as one with similar figures derived from The intervention of the Sabine women.® The appropriate conclusion seems to be that, if Wilkie consciously used David's composition, he did so for formal reasons, perhaps in the knowledge that a thematic connection existed between their subjects and that a great historical work would be the appropriate foundation on which to base a painting which raised genre to the level of history. For Landseer, his choice of The oath of the Horatii as the basis of his composition may have owed something to his knowledge that, in painting the portrait of an American, he was painting the citizen of a republic. 'H. Frost' was keen to stress Van Amburgh's loyalty to 'that plain and republican simplicity to which he had in early life been inducted'.48 But it is difficult to imagine such a staunch monarchist as the Duke of Wellington approving such reasoning, and (as with Wilkie's picture, if it owes anything to David) one must wonder whether the Duke was aware of the source of the composition. According to the Quarterly Review , the Duke determined the lion-tamer's pose: 'The unfortunate eyes and straddle of Van Amburgh were a likeness more pleasing to the practical patron than to the refining artist. Sir Edwin, however, was compelled to obey orders.'49 But this is not to 30 say that he knew that Landseer had taken this figure and his composition as a whole from David. The Duke may have known and even given it his approval, but in view of David's revolutionary credentials this seems unlikely. In motivated fact Landseer's by more than use just of compositional David may well considerations. have been motivated by more than just compositional considerations. Although his prickly and unpredictable character led to strained relations with many of his patrons, he always seems to have been on good, though very formal, terms with the Duke of Wellington, and there is no reason to doubt that he acknowledged the Duke's status as the hero of his age.50 But whether he was an admirer of Van Amburgh is another matter, and, as we shall see, there is evidence that he was more than a little presumptuous with the Duke's commission to paint the American's portrait, as its extraordinary reference to Macready may have already suggested. Indeed, surprising as it may appear, given the august and influential patron for whom it was painted, it is likely that the picture had a hidden satirical intent. In Landseer's case it does not seem irrelevant that David's historical scenes were dismissed in England as pompous and unnatural. This is suggested by his probable use of some caricatures published as part of yet another attack on David by a British critic. In 1839 the young WM Thackeray had written an article in Fraser' s Magazine , 'On the French School of Painting', which was republished the following year as one of several essays in his Paris Sketch Book . In the 1850s Thackeray became one of Landseer's closest friends, but they certainly knew one another long before - they may have met in the late 1830s at one of the famous soirées held by their mutual friends Lady Blessington and Alfred, comte d'Orsay - and it is possible that Landseer had read the Paris Sketch Book on its publication in 1840 when he first visited the French capital.51 In his review of the 1839 Royal Academy exhibition Thackeray had dismissed the Queen's portrait of Van Amburgh as 'a bad picture', and had even confessed to 'a kind of delight in finding out Mr. Edwin Landseer' in a weak moment. But, although he expressed reservations about Landseer's ability to paint the human figure, he always acknowledged his mastery as a painter of animals, and never doubted his place among the leading artists of his time.52 In his essay for Fraser 's Magazine Thackeray discussed modern French painting with unusual sympathy for an Englishman, but on the subject of David's historical pictures he was every bit as scathing as Hazlitt or Haydon had been. He accepted that David had 'a genius for painting portraits and common life', but he had no doubt that as a painter of the heroic he 'failed signally; and what is worse, [he] carried a whole nation blundering after him'.53 The figures of Tatius (wrongly identified as Romulus) in the Sabine Women and those of the Horatii brothers were singled out for particularly harsh criticism: And how are we to suppose yonder straddle [of 'Romulus'] to be the true characteristic of the heroic and the sublime? Romulus stretches his legs as far as ever nature will allow; the Horatii, in receiving their swords, think proper to stretch their legs too. . . Romulus's is the exact action of a telegraph; and the Horatii are all in the position of the lunge. Is this the sublime? Mr Angelo [the fencing master], of Bond-street, might admire the attitude; his namesake, Michael, I don't think would.54 And to emphasise his point, Thackeray added stickmen caricatures of the poses of the figures to his text (PI 7). It is not unreasonable to suggest that this little frieze o'f parodies was in Landseer's mind when he conceived his second</page><page sequence="7">Volume IH, No.3 Tbe BRITISH ART Journal S Alexander and Diogenes by Edwin Landseer, 1848. Oil on canvas, 112.5 x 142.6 cm. ©Tate, London 2001 Although, used to support despite the appearances, contention the that animals the Yale cannot portrait be used to support the contention that the Yale portrait satirises Van Amburgh, the composition itself, even setting aside its possible origins in caricature, may be significant. Van Amburgh was not an actor but a circus and stage performer - a class of entertainer rarely afforded the honour of a painted likeness - but both his portraits by Landseer can be related to the tradition of theatrical portraiture which had flourished in England with Hogarth, Reynolds and Zoffany and which continued well into the nineteenth century. The title of the Duke's picture explicitly identifies it as a portrait of Van Amburgh 'as he appeared with his Animals at the London Theatres'. Few works of this kind, however, assert their essence as images of spectacle in such an unequivocal manner. By including the iron bars and the audience (visible in the Queen's picture and represented by the foreground objects in the Duke's), Landseer proclaimed the staged as opposed to 'natural' character of the scenes he depicted. In doing so he also differentiated them from conventional theatrical portraits in which, though the sitters often strike dramatic poses, the audience and any immediately recognisable 31 portrait of Van Amburgh. Not only is it similarly derived from The oath of the Horatii, but the commanding pose of the stickman 'Romulus' is even closer to that of Van Amburgh than it is to the figure of Tatius on which it is based.55 Landseer himself was an accomplished caricaturist in pen- and-ink, producing literally hundreds of amusing sketches of his contemporaries, particularly his fellow guests at aristocratic house parties.56 Private jokes and facetious banter were also an expected part of communication in the artistic circles he frequented at the time he painted Van Amburgh for the Duke. Macready was not the only one of his friends to hold the lion-tamer in contempt. Charles Dickens, who had derided Van Amburgh in a review of the London theatres in The Examiner in 1840, wrote an apologetic letter to Landseer in June 1847 in which he signed himself 'Charles Dickens otherwise Wan Amburg'.57 A month later, after he had seen a performance by 'Miss Chapman, the British Lion Queen', he wrote sarcastically to another correspondent: 'Seriously, she beats Van Amburgh. And I think the Duke of Wellington must have her painted by Landseer.'58 The 'smart' set of artists and writers around Landseer was hardly likely to be impressed by a sensationalist performance like Van Amburgh 's, and Landseer himself was above all a man who delighted in the majesty of wild animals in their natural surroundings, not reduced by fear to tame subservience in a cage. In the 1840s Landseer seems to have become more reflective, more critical of the world around him, than he had been earlier, and by 1847 his attitude to Van Amburgh may well have hardened since he had painted the first portrait for the Queen eight years earlier.59</page><page sequence="8">The BRITISH AR X Journal Volume III, No.3 indications of the stage are usually omitted.60 It is as if he wished to emphasise that it was Van Amburgh the performer, rather than Van Amburgh the man, who so impressed the Queen and the Duke of Wellington. Moreover, in the Duke's picture the overtly staged character of the composition is emphasised by the pose of the lion-tamer, taken from a source condemned in Britain as forced and artificial, and by an artist associated in many British minds with the exercise of despotic power. Taken together these facts suggest that Landseer considered Van Amburgh's act to be a travesty of nature, rather than nature itself as the Duke believed. For all the Duke's emphasis on the universal moral implications of Van Amburgh and his animals, in Landseer's portrait we see a man playing a rôle, like an actor on the stage. He is also doing so in a bombastic manner characteristic of melodrama, which was already being supplanted in the contemporary theatre by a more restrained and naturalistic style.61 British theatrical painting includes many instances of portraits so imposing in scale and historical allusion that they come close to history painting. Renowned examples include Hogarth's Garrick as Richard III (1745; Liverpool, National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside, Walker Art Gallery) and Reynolds's Mrs Siddons as the Tragic Muse (1784; San Marino, California, Henry E. Huntington Art Gallery); Lawrence even described his portrait of John Philip Kemble as Coriolanus (1798; London, Guildhall Art Gallery) as 'a sort of half-history picture'.62 Landseer's portrait of Van Amburgh, on the other hand, while grand in scale, undermines its biblical and historical allusions (to Daniel in the Lions' den and to David and Roman history) by making it clear from the beginning that this is a representation of a stage performance. In the 1840s history painting was much in the news with the work of the Fine Arts Commission which was then organising competitions of designs for murals in the new Palace of Westminster.63 The Commission actively sought to promote high art in England at a time when, thanks mainly to the influence of its chairman, Prince Albert, the German practice of funding public art for moral purposes was much admired in English artistic society. Haydon was one of those who submitted designs to the competitions, and Landseer himself had been involved in Prince Albert's ill-conceived scheme to decorate the Garden Pavilion at Buckingham Palace in fresco as a trial run for the Westminster murals.64 But, though Landseer painted many historical subjects, he avoided noble themes of the kind required for monumental art, and he seems to have regarded himself as unsuited to traditional history painting. Portrait of Mr. Van Amburgh , as a modern theatrical scene with a composition based on a famous but despised historical work, pokes fun at the pretensions of history painting, particularly the high moral and rhetorical style which had been vigorously promoted by David and Haydon and which now seemed utterly outmoded. In doing so it resembles, whether wittingly or not, the simultaneous campaign by Thackeray and others in Punch to mock the entries for the Westminster competitions, many of which were actually in a new, more naturalistic, style which owed little to Haydon's beloved grand manner.65 It may also make fun of the practice, exemplified above all by Reynolds, the founder of English academicism, of incorporating poses from prints after the Old Masters into portraiture. Although few submissions to the Royal Academy's annual exhibitions acknowledged the ideals of high art, the competitions for the Palace of Westminster gave those ideals a new contemporary relevance, and Haydon's Lectures on Painting and Design , 32 published in 1844, were specifically intended to keep what he called 'sound principles of High Art in the public mind'.66 The Yale portrait is not the only satirical painting which Landseer produced at this time and it is not the only one to refer to such theoretical issues. In 1848, the year after he painted Van Amburgh, Landseer exhibited Alexander and Diogenes (PI 8), in which two terriers act out the famous scene from Plutarch where Alexander the Great encounters the philosopher Diogenes in his tub. More than any other work, it demonstrates Landseer's willingness to challenge the conventions of history painting and even to undermine the moral value of classical precedent.67 Eight years earlier he had shown Laying down the Law (Chatsworth, the Trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement) which lampoons the legal profession by depicting a poodle and various other dogs as a befuddled judge surrounded by his court officials and jurors.68 This vein of satire, mocking cruelty and pretension, seems particularly relevant to his portrayal of Van Amburgh in the Yale portrait. On 25 March 1848 the Duke of Wellington wrote briefly to Landseer to send him his payment and to arrange delivery of the picture which had remained in the artist's studio after the Royal Academy exhibition. The Duke added that he was aware 'how much I am indebted to you for the care and pains which you have devoted to the execution of this work of art'.69 The letter which Landseer wrote in reply is a fascinating document which is worth quoting in full: March 26th 1848. St. Johns Wood My Lord Duke I have very great pleasure in offering your Grace my thanks for your highly flattering letter just received, and beg to acknowledge the receipt of your draft enclosed, for one thousand pounds; that generous sum accompanied by your kind praise and approbation of the treatment of the subject is more than I deserve. Your Grace is solely entitled to the merit of the point selected in the picture, if grandeur or dignity is depicted, as an illustration of the text from Scripture. The mind and thought belonging to the picture is yours, the matter only mine. The amount you have awarded the picture is so much more than I should have asked that I venture to hope you will allow me the pleasure to paint whatever you will do me the honour to suggest, in addition to the Van Amburgh subject. I have the honour to remain, my Lord Duke, most gratefully and very respectfully yours E. Landseer70 On one level, this can be read as a conventional letter of thanks to a generous patron. It certainly establishes that the religious connotations of the subject were entirely in the mind of the Duke rather than the artist. But surely it is also possible to discern behind Landseer's words a sense of embarrassment about the painting and an admission that it was rather more than the Duke imagined it to be? Unlike the Duke, Landseer, it seems, had his doubts whether 'grandeur or dignity is depicted', and the offer to paint another work 'in addition to the Van Amburgh subject' seems suspiciously like an attempt to make some amends for his disingenuous treatment of a patron who had been exceptionally kind to him.</page><page sequence="9">Volume III, No.3 The BRITISH ART Journal There portrait is a to further, consider. slightly Although macabre, aspect Landseer of the was Yale a portrait to consider. Although Landseer was a notoriously dilatory portrait painter, it is possible to suggest a reason why, after being commissioned to paint the picture probably in 1839, it was only in the summer of 1846 that he finally found the inspiration to work on it in earnest. By that time another American entertainer was the toast of London society. Indeed, his success was on a scale that would have astonished Van Amburgh himself. From almost the moment he arrived in London in February 1844 Charles Sherwood Stratton (1838-83), the boy midget known as General Tom Thumb, had enjoyed enormous public acclaim (PI 9). 71 Presented by his 'guardian', the incomparable showman Phineas T Barnum, he was soon fêted in the most fashionable salons and, after receiving royal approval with three appearances before the Queen at Buckingham Palace, his performances of songs, dances and monologues attracted all ranks of society in their thousands to the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly. The Duke of Wellington paid several visits. Once, when 'the little General' was impersonating Napoleon musing on the island of St Helena, the Duke asked him what was the subject of his thoughts and was doubtless delighted to receive the reply: 'I was thinking of the loss of the battle of Waterloo.'72 When he appeared in a play at the Lyceum Theatre in May 1846 Landseer and Macready agreed - though admittedly 'with no relish' on Macready's part - when Dickens proposed that they should all go to see him 73 It was on 4 April 1846 that Benjamin Robert Haydon opened the exhibition of his latest historical works at the Egyptian Hall while Tom Thumb was also appearing there in his third season.74 On occasions Haydon expressed great faith in the public's taste for grand historical painting, but he had seen little evidence of it in the years since 1820 when he had attracted enthusiastic crowds to the same building to see his enormous picture, Christ's entry into Jerusalem (Cincinnati, Ohio, St Mary's Seminary). In 1846, however, he soon discovered that it was Tom Thumb who now ruled the public's heart. On 12 April he wrote the pathetic entry in his diary, 'Tom Thumb had 12,000 last week; B.R. Haydon, 1331/2 (a little girl).'75 After he closed his exhibition in May he wrote in a brief moment of defiance, '...I marched out before General Thumb, a beaten but not conquered exhibitor',76 but little more than a month later, on 22 June, crushed by disappointment and huge financial debts, he committed suicide. Landseer had joined Haydon's studio in 1815 and remained there for some three years. Haydon lent him anatomical studies of a lion and later asserted that 'Landseer dissected animals under my eye, copied my anatomical drawings and carried my principles of study into animal painting'.77 According to WP Frith, Landseer attributed much of his success 'to Haydon's insisting upon dissection of animals as a vital element in the practice of an animal painter', but as early as 1819 Haydon was complaining of Landseer's ingratitude, and for the rest of his life he continued to carp at his success.78 One of the last entries Haydon made in his diary was 'Edwin Landseer has received this year 7000 - sale &amp; copy right - here I am his old Instructor, obliged to withdraw my Pictures for Tom Thumb with the loss of £111. 8s. 10d'.79 Landseer's attitude to Haydon was probably deeply ambivalent - an inextricable confusion of grudging respect and lofty disdain. No doubt there were faults on both sides, but, whatever the rights and wrongs of the relationship, it is clear that Landseer could not forget his teacher, even though he must have often longed to do so. No comment by him on Haydon's death seems to have been recorded, but Haydon may not have been far from his thoughts when he at last found the inspiration to paint Van Amburgh's portrait for the Duke of Wellington. Haydon had worshipped the Duke ('the greatest Hero in the world'),80 and had painted him on many occasions; but the Duke's only recorded response to Haydon's death had been to send round a servant to collect a hat he had lent him.81 Many others, however, felt an acute sense of guilt about Haydon after he was gone. In an editorial The Times acknowledged his status as a martyr for the cause of high art and savagely attacked 'the display of a disgusting dwarf [who] attracted hordes of gaping idiots who poured into the pockets of a Yankee showman a stream of wealth one tithe of which would have redeemed an honourable English artist from wretchedness and death'.82 Perhaps Landseer also expressed some of this shame tinged with patriotic fervour in his portrait of Van Amburgh, even as he mocked the high art to which Haydon had been so devoted. After all, like Tom Thumb, the lion-tamer was a stage performer - not a painter (a member of a far more prestigious profession) - who had crossed the Atlantic and won the enthusiastic approval of the two most admired and influential people in the land, the Queen and the Duke of Wellington. And what could demonstrate the triumph of the Americans better than Van Amburgh's command of a lion, the very symbol of Britain, which writhes in* the corner in Landseer's remarkable portrait?83 33 9 Tom Thumb as Napoleon.

I would like to thank everyone at Yale for providing me with a warm welcome and a wonderful environment for academic study. It is unjust to mention only a few people by name, but I must nevertheless make a particular point of thanking Judith Colton of the art history department and, at the Yale Center, the former Director, Patrick McCaughey, the Senior Curator of Paintings and Sculpture, Malcolm Warner (who kindly made very valuable comments on an early draft of this article), Cecie Clement and Lori Misura. Outside Yale, I also wish to thank Richard Ormond for the great kindness with which he has allowed me to benefit from his unrivalled knowledge of the sources relating to Landseer. Others who have helped in various ways and whom it is a pleasure to thank include Victoria Crake, Jeremy Howard, Peter Hughes, Christopher Lloyd, Nicholas Mackenzie and Alicia Robinson.

The subject of the lion and the lamb was later to be of great significance to Landseer 34 (see Lennie, op cit, pp 231-3). It has often been pointed out that the lion at the rear of the cage in Landseer's painting anticipates his famous bronze lions at the foot of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square. The widespread admiration for Landseer's depictions of the animals in his two portraits of Van Amburgh may even have played a part in the decision to award him this enormously prestigious commission. On the Trafalgar Square lions see Ormond, op cit, pp 204-6. 10 Frost, op cit, p 17. Early in his life Lysimachus (c360-281 BC) was one of Alexander the Great's bodyguards.

The evidence for Landseer receiving help with the painting, perhaps from another artist, is a letter dated 14 December 1846, from him to someone whose name is difficult to read. It appears to be Cullen, but may be [Henry] CoUen (1798-after 1872), a miniature painter, who was friendly with Landseer. In it he writes: 'I'm working again at the Picture of V Amburgh. I find it will be necessary for me to give a morning to the subject before you are good enough to lend me a hand. . .

And God said let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. In the 28th Verse it is said, - have dominion over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.' The Duke would appear to have been a pioneer of the 19th-century revival of picture frames inscribed with biblical quotations, a manner of presenting paintings associated particularly with the Pre- Raphaelites. 20 See Wellington, op cit, and CM Kauffmann, Catalogue of Paintings in the Wellington Museum, London , Victoria and Albert Museum, 1982. One of the Duke's very few modern paintings not associated with his family or public life was also commissioned from Landseer (and was his only other work by the artist): An illicit whisky still in the Highlands (1826-9; London, Apsley House). Sir Walter Scott introduced Landseer to the Duke in 1824 (Lennie, op cit, p 37). 21 Although leopards were advertised, there was some confusion as to whether Van Amburgh's big cats included leopards or cheetahs (and the Queen in her Journal for 23 February 1839 (quoted in the second paragraph of this article) mentions a panther). As Campbell Lennie remarks, "The two spotted cats which the Queen referred to in her Journal [on another occasion] as "2 Chetas, or Kind of leopards" seem to be neither quite one thing nor the other' (Lennie, op cit, p 105). Van Amburgh was said to be the first trainer to combine lions, tigers and leopards in a stage performance, as well as the first to put his head between the jaws of a lion (TUrner, op cit, p 4). 22 The Athenaeum, XX, no. 1019, 8 May 1847, p 495; The Times, 1 May 1847, p 6. 23 The Art Journal, October 1879, p 208. 24 The Quarterly Review, XCII, December 1852 and March 1853, p 454. 25 The Athenaeum, XX, no. 1019, 8 May 1847, p 495. 26 The relevance of Hogarth to Landseer was recognised in the nineteenth century (see W Cosmo Monkhouse, Art Journal, 1879, pp 178-9, 201-4 and 245-9). 27 See, for example, Caroline Arscott in Katharine Lochnan (ed), Seductive Surfaces: the Art oflìssot, New Haven &amp; London, 1999, p 53, with bibliographical references. 28 See Gerhard Langemeyer, 'Das Stilleben als Attribut' in Stilleben in Europa, Münster, Westfälisches Landesmuseum, 1979, pp 220-41. Of course, the use of still-life in this manner became commonplace throughout much of Europe. The composition of Landseer's painting, with the framed principal scene and the still life in the foreground, may be compared with seventeenth-century Dutch paintings (see, for example, Werner Sumowski, Gemälde der Rembrandt-Schüler, Landau, 1983, 1, pp 64, 568, 574 and 593). The bars of the cage in the Yale portrait, however, are exceptional in emphasising the unique and self-contained nature of Van Amburgh's environment. 29 See AH Saxon, 'Edwin Landseer's Joke on Macready', Nineteenth-Century Theatre Research, 6:2 (Autumn 1978), pp 89-93. 30 William Toynbee (ed), The Diaries of William Charles Macready 1833-1851, London, 1912, 1, p 494. 31 JC Hrewin, Mr. Macready.

Thackeray was also a friend of Macready (see, for example, Ray, op cit, H, pp 220, 226 and 401); both men were members of the Garrick Club, Macready a founder member in 1831, and Thackeray from 1833 (Geoffrey Ashton, Kaiman A Burnim and Andrew Wilton, Pictures in the Garrick Club.

In fact, Ellen Chapman with her animals was painted twice by George Christopher Horner: Sotheby's, London, 21 March 2001 (103). In 1864, at a time when their friendship had cooled, Dickens even referred to Landseer disparagingly as 'that Van Amburgh of Trafalgar Square' in a letter to WP Frith: Graham Storey, ed, T he Letters of Charles Dickens, X, Oxford, 1998, p 381. 59 See Ormond, op cit, p 181. It may also be relevant that public attitudes towards cruelty to animals had become less tolerant since 1839 (see Harriet Ritvo, The Animal Estate. The English and other Creatures in the Victorian Age, Cambridge, Ma, and London, 1987, pp 127-31). The RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), founded as the SPCA in 1824, acquired its royal patronage in 1840. Landseer drew a presentation portrait of the Society's founder, Richard Martin (Ormond, op cit, p 17). 60 The largest single published source of English theatrical portraits is Ashton, Burnim and Wilton, op cit. None of the portraits of actors in costume in the Garrick Club's collection depicts an audience or a stage setting that would be immediately identifiable as such by any viewer. Perhaps the most notable among the few exceptions to this observation (which applies to French as well as English) theatrical portraiture before the mid-19th century are Hogarth's various versions of The Beggar's Opera where the audience as well as the actors are shown. On the subject of settings in theatrical scenes see Geoffrey Ashton, 'The Golden Age of British Theatrical Portraiture', in Ashton, Burnim and Wilton, op cit, pp xxiii-xxix; also Shearer West, The Image of the Actor. Verbal and Visual Representation in the Age of Garrick and Kemble, London, 1991, pp 27, 32 and 57. 61 Michael R Booth in John Russell Brown, ed, The Oxford Illustrated History of Theatre, Oxford and New York, 1995, p 324. Van Amburgh in Landseer's portrait, by striking a pose which has its origins in painting, appears as if taking part in a tableau vivant, an immensely popular feature of theatrical practice in the early nineteenth century. Landseer also adds a further dimension by painting a figure who himself is imitating a painting. On tableaux vivants and their relation to painting and the novel see Martin Meisel, Realizations. Narrative Pictorial, and Theatrical Arts in Nineteenth-Century England , Princeton, 1983, pp 47-9 and 91-165. 62 Quoted Ashton, Burnim and Wilton, op cit, pp xxviii (see Kenneth Garlick, Sir Thomas Lawrence, a complete catalogue of the oil paintings, Oxford, 1989, no. 451(b), and also Shearer West, 'Thomas Lawrence's "Half- History" Portraits and the Politics of Theatre', Art History, vol 14, no. 2, June 1991, pp 225-49). See also Ashton, Burnim and Wilton, op cit, pp xxviii-xxix for the grand manner in theatrical portraiture. 63 See Christine Riding and Jacqueline Riding, eds, The Houses of Parliament: History, Art, Architecture, London, 2000, pp 213-23. 64 Lennie, op cit, pp 117-19; Riding and Riding, op cit, pp 219-20. 65 See, for example, Punch, or the London Charivari, y 1843, p 38, VI, 1844, p 205; and Riding and Riding, op cit, p 234. 66 BR Haydon, Lectures on Painting and Design, London, 1844, 1, p ix. 67 Ormond, op cit, p 198. 68 It was even suggested at the time that the painting was intended to satirise certain members of the bench or the Privy Council, though none has been identified. On this picture see Ormond, op cit, pp 191-4. 69 Wellington, op cit, p 336. The original letter was sold at Sotheby's, London, 21 February 1978 (329). (I am very grateful to Richard Ormond for this reference. A copy of the letter is in the archives at Stratfield Saye House.) Together with the letter in the Sotheby's sale was 'an autograph biblical quotation [presumably the two passages from Genesis] "written by the Duke of Wellington [and] given by him to Mr. E Landseer at Apsley House Augst 26 1846"'. This suggests that it was only then or shortly after that Landseer finally began to work seriously on the picture, although, given the dated nature of the humour in the playbill, it is possible that he first gave some thought to it in 1839 when the Duke probably awarded him the commission. 70 Wellington, ibid. Landseer did not paint another picture for the Duke. 71 For Tom Thumb in London see Raymund Fitzsimons, Bornum in London, London, 1969, and AH Saxon, P.T. Bornum.

Ironically, Haydon had depicted Napoleon musing on St Helena (Brown, Woof and Hebron, op cit, pp 18 and 163-4). 75 Pope, op cit, y p 533. 76 Pope, op at, y p 544. 77 Pope, op cit, n, pp 357-8; see also ibid, I, p 413 and y p 377. 78 WP Frith, My Autobiography and Reminiscences, 2nd edn, London, 1888, ffl, p 242; Lennie, op cit, p 17; also Pope, op cit, U, p 466. On 12 July 1842 Haydon wrote in his diary: 'The dogs of Landseer are exquisite, but why does he not paint a Lion, not a drawing-room Lion like Vein Omburgh's, but a down right, savage monarch of the Woods?' (Pope, op cit, y p 182). On 6 February 1839 Haydon had been to see Van Amburgh (Pope, op cit, iy p 543), but he did not record his opinions of the performance in his diary. 79 Pope, op cit, y p 547. 80 Pope, op cit, iy p 588. 81 Lennie, op dt, p 138. In 1828 the Duke had declined Haydon's request to be allowed to dedicate to him a pamphlet 'on the causes which have obstructed the advance of High Art in England for the last 70 years' (Pope, op cit, in, p 323). 82 The Times, 26 June 1846, p 5. 83 Whatever Landseer's intentions, Punch at least was aware that the lion in the corner could be used to represent Britain. In 1847 it published a cartoon, based on Landseer's painting, tided 'The Russian Van Amburgh taming the British Lion; Showing the Power of an Emperor's Gold'. It shows "Bar Nicholas I, as Van Amburgh, brandishing a bag of gold in front of an abashed British lion with a crown on his head {Punch, or the London Charivari , XU, 1847, p 201). Geoffrey Ashton noted that in the period 1750- 1850 'many political caricatures derive their impact from a theatrical allusion that the public would recognise immediately' (Ashton, Burnim and Wilton, op cit, p xxvii). 35</page></plain_text>
