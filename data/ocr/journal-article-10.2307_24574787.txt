Fig. 1: Postcard printed during WWI by ARTISTIQE Partnership, Wilno. Unknown author. The writing says: »A young volunteer. Petya Karapuzov runs away to the war without a warm coat«. The surname of Karapuzov is formed from the word &gt;karapuz&lt; - baby, shorty, plump kid. Priority in the attempts to comprehend the messages of childhood during World War I belongs to contemporaries of that time, and men of letters, writers and po ets were among them. Nursery rhymes and lamentation lyrics by Leonid Andru son, Nikolai Benedict ( Wentzel), Izabella Grinevskaya have a motif rendered by a mother where she mourns over the fate shattered by the war - both her own, wid ow's fate and the orphaned children's fate. Nikolai Klyuev's poems about peasant family living through the war, about a widow's lot are filled with compassion.1 The overall frame of mind in the literature of that time resonated with the folk legend about a child's tear that in the Heaven's trial turned the scale in favour of the Russian soldier against the adversary soldier. 1 Cf.

Child images widely used by different authors portrayed both their adoration of &gt;infant fighters&lt; and a gently ironical attitude towards the young seeker of war adventures (Fig. 1). In a way, these postcards also reflected the reality and were meant to cheer up soldiers. These and other artistic works have definitely contributed to the mental memory of the war, to the perception of wartime childhood through arts, and to preserving people's emotional response to this pivotal event. Russian realities of the early 20th century forced their way into children's magazines, which were more like books than periodicals. With the war around, bigger sections in the magazines were given to opinion journalism, which was emotional and often propagandist. A majority of children's magazines chose to romanticize the war, staying in the educational and overall societal mainstream of rendering the events of the war to children.3 A major concern for authors was patriotic fervour in children and the youth. Great tribute for recording children's reactions to the war events is due to educationists and psychologists, including school teachers, who analyzed children's behaviour in the war settings and pub lished their »follow-up« observations in pedagogical journals. For example, the &gt;Russkaya Shkola&lt; (Russian School) journal encouraged its authors to ask them selves »how has the war influenced children, what traces has it left in their souls?«4 Prominent Russian historians Nikolai Kareev, Pavel Milyukov, Pyotr Struve and others looked at WWI in a wide historical-philosophical context, trying to find its roots and draw lessons from history. This process was interrupted by rev olutionary events, which overturned the fate of the nation together with the fates of many scholars.5 Thus, an unbiased historical study of the WWI period was de layed for many decades. In Soviet times, imperial Russia's last war was plagued as being &gt;imperialistic&lt; and &gt;disgraceful&lt;. Historians of that time focused exclusively 2 Loc. cit., 446. 3 Cf. Larisa N.

The post-Soviet period set full-fledged studies of WWI in motion. Large-scope archival research began, and the sources were being published.6 The range of re search tasks became wider, and the questions scientists &gt;addressed&lt; to the sources were broadened. The drivers that helped the studies to advance were conferences, which were usually devoted to the war anniversaries, and acted as &gt;crossroads&lt; of various historiographical traditions. Let us mention two of them. One of the first big conferences took place in Moscow in 1994, launching systematic international discussion of the approaches and methods in war studies.7 A ground-breaking event was the inclusion of a special &gt;Children and War&lt; section in the proceed ings of a conference that was organized on a jubilee year at the Leningrad State University.8 It was only at the verge of the 21st century that children were brought into the Russian historiography of WWI. The inclusion of this &gt;forlorn&lt; category hap pened owing to the development of quite a number of study lines, of which two have been the key ones. They were, firstly, the establishment of historical-anthro pological approach in military historiography and, secondly, the development of children's studies&lt;. Both synthesized the achievements, subject matters and research tools of many disciplines, including social history, historical psycholo gy, history of mentalities, everyday history, history of language arts (literary and folklore texts of various genres), pedagogy, culture studies and other humani ties. Both took shape in Russian historiography in the post-Soviet time, when the humanities got rid of the ideological harness, where contacts with foreign researchers became active, and a wide access was provided to the expertise in historiography available globally. Speaking of wartime childhood history, truly valuable are studies by Elena Senyavskaya, Russia's leading specialist in military anthropology. Interesting, for instance, are her methodological approaches to studies of &gt;human factor&lt; in wars using the historical science toolkit.9 A crucial postulate by Senyavskaya is that the 6 Cf.

The understanding of various aspects of the »children and the war&lt; matter has been much promoted by the introduction into the scientific discourse of previously unknown or little known sources covering years 1914-1918 through publication of collations of documents: essays, diaries, letters and memories of wartime childhood.11 Interpretation of the materials contained in these sources calls for non-trivial approaches. Common manners in the analysis of children's autobiographic texts about the war have been found by Russian historians and psychologists through dialogue with foreign colleagues, mainly relying on mate rials related to WWII.12 Some researchers have considered childhood in WWI through the prism of socio-demographic problems: refugee migrations, changes in family structure due to drafting of reservists and the deaths of fathers with resultant child or phanhood and homelessness. Closely scrutinized were the circumstances of unwedded soldiers' wives and their &gt;illegitimate&lt; children, who were utterly indigent during the war, since, according to the law, rations and welfare were due only to the officially registered (church wedded) soldiers' wives and their children.13 Child labour multiplied in scope during the war: children were more 10 Elena S.

The proportion of children in private enterprises was up to 40 % of all workers. In urban areas, children during the war became responsible for standing many-hour queues for food.14 The situation in which children found themselves during the war is highlighted in publications on the activities of foster care agencies and charity organizations, including monasteries, Romanovs' Ref ugee Assistance Committee, and other committees working under the patronage of the royal family.15 Another aspect of wartime childhood is school and education during the war, where, on the one hand, the teaching profession sharply grew more feminized, and on the other - the school had to adopt absolutely new, wartime-related func tions, such as care of and assistance to children of fighting and dead soldiers, organization of charity events, making, collecting and forwarding items to the frontline, establishment of pupils teams to assist in farming, etc. Researchers usually focus on how the morale building and school daily routines changed.16 Petersburg: Nestor 2009,183-214; Valentina A.

Prayers for the dead in rural schools included also the mention of fellow villagers who had died in the war. The war induced a rapid change in the attitudes of villagers towards school and education for children, who could read newspapers and letters from the front to their practically illiterate families and neighbours. Public appraisal of the school rose also as it organized charity cam paigns for the benefit of orphans and the injured, and the sending of letters and parcels to the frontline. All of that eventually raised the status of a schoolchild in a peasant family.18 Researchers could not but be intrigued by such a wartime phenomenon as children running away to joint the troops. A famous poet Korney Chukovsky thought its scope resembled a new children's Crusade.19 Volunteers varied in terms of social status and age, but boys aged 10-13 prevailed.20 Among the prima ry reasons for children to run away to the frontline researchers named patriotic feelings, adventurous spirit and &gt;war romanticism&lt;, the desire to transform the habitual war games into the &gt;reality format*. It has not yet been studied whether some children ran away to the war fleeing family problems, poverty, school ex ams, or controversies with parents or teachers. There is no doubt, however, that numerous newspaper and magazine publications about children's heroism, and examples of courage, which impressed both children and adults, did stimulate those runaways. On the other hand, front-line soldiers quite often remarked that children could be useless or even detrimental, being a hindrance in battle and in the field. It was not only fatherly care that awaited children joining troops and often claim to be orphans.

Involvement of agile and adroit children in dangerous operations was not rare. For instance, field officers willingly employed teenagers in surveillance, obser vations of enemy motions and location. Those who knew some German proved to be especially useful.21 This interesting aspect has been covered by Igor Kanaev and Pavel Shcherbinin, who focused on the attempts of Russian counterintelli gence to withstand the use of children as spies during WWI. Relying on archival materials and periodicals, these authors described a practice of secret services of other countries recruiting ethnic Russian or otherwise Slavic teenagers. Af ter training, for example at the Warsaw special training school, these children, disguised as refugees, conducted intelligence activities or guerilla warfare in the rear of Russian troops. Activities of spy children have been reported from Odes sa, Petrograd, Kiev and Moscow.22 On the other hand, the authors did not analyze how the identification of children as spies influenced the spy fever induced in the Russian society by propaganda.23 Neither have the recruitment methods or the motives for the children to go over to the enemy side been investigated. In fact, as applied to WWII the topic of child collaborationism is still practically a taboo.24 Running away to the war was closely related to children's deviant behaviour. A justification for many thefts by children was the &gt;noble cause&lt; of gathering money to get to the frontline. Teenagers sent off home from the frontline also took to stealing, as they have tasted freedom and were unwilling to live in the family. Instead they became vagabonds, sometimes with most unhappy consequences. Compared to the pre-war year 1913, juvenile (under 18) crime in 1925 increased by 33%, and in 1916 - by 72 %.25 However, pilfering by children is not a novelty, and neither is homelessness that induces stealing. Recent Russian historiography stands out for a wider analysis of deviations, partly owing to the generally high interest in deviant behaviour among modern Russian historians. The problem of child prostitution during the war was raised by Pavel Shcherbinin.26 As a fol 21 Cf. loc. cit., 209. 22 Cf. loc. cit., 210-211. 23 Cf.

She believed one of the reasons for such deviations was the &gt;early maturation&lt; of wartime children - unsupervised teenagers were increasingly visiting bars, pool rooms and other leisure and entertainment facilities, which cost quite a lot.28 There, teenagers felt like adults, spent their first income and then, having devel oped a taste for pleasures, easily took to stealing. The rapidly developing cine matography was also an attraction for children and teenagers.29 Thus, childhood during WWI has been considered by researchers from differ ent angles and through its various manifestations. Yet, the interest in the every day life of children appeared most vividly. Speaking of the sources for studying the everyday life of children during WWI, Pavel Shcherbinin mentioned, first of all, family archives (including photographs, letters, recollections) and periodi cals (both secular and ecclesiastical). Another group of sources in his listing was materials from central and regional archives, especially the now undeserving ly forgotten storage of former party archives, where one can find, for instance, recollections of members of the revolutionary movement, including information about their childhood. The researcher also found it potentially useful to study wartime laws and regulations concerning children and parents, to examine items of visual arts and literature (for children and about children) as sources, to study children's game, children's folklore and the material dimension of childhood (toys, furniture, clothing, etc.).30 Deciding on the sources of relevance one should remember a remark by Alia Sal'nikova, the author of a fundamental study on the history of Russian child hood in the 20th century, that the types of sources should be prioritized depend ing on the research tasks: (Proceedings of the History and Philosophy Unit at the Tambov State Technical University: collected scientific papers) 4 (2006), 71-77. 27 Cf.

[...] when one speaks of the children's world as it functions &gt;in ternally&lt;, official documents should yield the priority to personal sources, where the &gt;private&lt; lives of each child are added up to form a &gt;common&lt; &gt;children's&lt; life of the era«.31 A true wellhead of sources created by children themselves and letting one look at the war through their eyes, not yet dimmed by adult stereotypes, are pedagogical journals published during World War I. Such were, first of all, Vestnik Vospi taniya, Russkaya Shkola, Narodnyi Uchitel', which published both excerpts and full texts of children's essays and letters, their utterances on the war, drawings, results of interviews and questionnaires. Journal publications shed light on such aspects as the effect of war on school, including growing learning activity of chil dren; recognition of the value of education by villagers and the alteration of the attitude towards children; changes in children's leisure, including game practices and topics for drawings; stereotypes forming in children's mentality in relation to Russian battle forces and the &gt;enemies of Russian No wonder researchers today thoroughly search pedagogical journals for information about wartime child hood. For instance, Lydmila Semyonova and Veronika Karpova overviewed the contents and assessed the materials published in the Russkaya Shkola journal in their articles.32 A great contribution elaborating the methods of analyzing texts created by children was made by Alia Sal'nikova. The key message of her approach is that time-variable age, gender, regional, ethnic, social, subject matter components of childhood should be taken into account. Analyzing children's texts and chil dren's memories of the &gt;age of catastrophes&lt;, the researcher took notice of the vocabulary and style usage, set of images, and emotional colouring. She came to a conclusion, that in order to atone for the linguistic &gt;paucity&lt;, children were eager to »reproduce everything the way it was in reality«33 with utmost honesty. The monographic book by Alia Sal'nikova &gt;Russian childhood in the 20th century: the history, theory and practice of research&lt; (2007), a special section in which is devoted to WWI, was unfortunately published in as little as 300 copies. It is perhaps because the book soon turned into a bibliographic rarity that the authors who have lately addressed the topic often overlook the conclusions con tained therein and partly replicate the previously performed studies. 31 Alla A.

In contrast to most Russian authors, the research er relied not only on domestic but also on international research traditions, tak ing into consideration a widest range of childhood studies, covering also the &gt;age of catastrophes&lt;. Employing the gender-based approach, the author expanded, for instance, on the characteristics of the texts and drawings produced by girls. Expectedly, drawings by girls were more peaceable and lyrical, depicting the wounded and the nurses attending to them, infirmaries and medical trains. The researcher in terpreted the typical combination of war scenes and nature motifs (e. g., pictures of girls gathering flowers and chasing butterflies while bombs are thrown down on them from a German airplane) as a »silent protest against the horrors of war, which carries death to all the living and the beautiful«34. It is a conspicuous fact that girls' letters to the frontline were often quite one like another, whereas boys showed more creativity. Girls' texts, on the other hand, were more pitiful and sympathetic, even towards the enemy. Besides, girls made a specifically feminine sort of messages - embroidered inscriptions on handker chiefs, tobacco pouches and other hand-made items they sent to soldiers. Inter estingly, the letters with which soldiers replied to girls were also quite peculiar: they featured a grandiloquent, ornately courteous style. To write such letters to &gt;learned damsels&lt; soldiers sought assistance from junior officers and clerks.35 The emotional state of child-authors set in a war context shows through in children's texts. Girls would more often than boys write about their fear, not hiding their feelings behind bravado. Relying on psychological data, Alia Sal'nikova conclud ed that in children the unease was transformed into its antithesis - aggressive ness, »in which girls matched boys, and sometimes even outmatched them«.36 Militarization of the everyday life of children also had an effect on the litera ture and games developed for them. While the wartime fiction pictured boys as heroes and described their feats, it showed girls more often as victims of the cruel and insidious enemy. In addition to the literature, the socio-cultural environ ment of the childhood, the feelings and attitudes of children were much influ enced by games and toys created by adults.37 Admiration of children in military outfit, encouragement of the military style in children's clothes by adults also nourished certain sentiments among children. The &gt;formatting&lt; of children's atti tudes towards the war showed most vividly in organization of a militarized youth 34 Loc. cit., 160. 35 Cf. loc. cit., 149-151; Alla A.

Thus, there appeared games within children's correspond ence with their fighting fathers. One such game was a picture that one of the correspondence counterparts started to draw, and the other one continued or completed. In the traditional &gt;war game&lt;, which turned into the most popular outdoor entertainment for both urban and rural children, girls usually ended up with the undesirable role of enemies, which was the only way for them to join the boys' company. Girls themselves played &gt;hospital&lt; games, pretending to be nurses and &gt;treating&lt; wounded soldiers, often represented by dolls. Doll funerals, which were a typical component of such games, are sometimes erroneously interpreted as a manifestation of a certain frame of mind during wartime. Examples from Russian literature for children and various ethnographic data convincingly prove that this ritual is an &gt;all-time cliché&lt; in children's games.39 Russian historiography of the WWI period takes the reader right to the ques tion of the responsibility of adults before children, of the line in military-patri otic upbringing that runs between the task of adapting children to the war in a least traumatizing way on the one hand, and romanticizing the war in texts and games, which adults make for children, on the other, the latter causing fascina tion with war and not just impeding the children's further transition to peaceful life but also generating a special type of personality.40 WWI contemporary literary critics and pedagogues wrote that inconsiderate propaganda and concentrated information about the war targeted at children de prived the younger generation of the idea of peace and friendship among nations, made blindfolded patriotism and egotism take over, and led to a bloom of ethnic ideas.41 The problem of children's captivation by war and involvement in its actual events was also a concern for servicemen, who witnessed teenagers take part in war battles and thought that, as a result, the children developed a &gt;pathological mentality.

Conclusions Contemporary Russian historiography helps to understand the multifarious na ture of wartime childhood, but does not yet disclose all of its dimensions.

The roots of many socio-cultural phenomena that reach across centuries, have also run through the thick historical stratum of WWI, which has shaped the largely militarized generation that passed on to its compatriots - children and grandchildren - the norms and values modified by the war. Thus, while leaving behind the Orthodox spirit, the military-patriotic education in the Soviet school did, however, reproduce some of the practices from WWI, and the pioneer or ganization was morphologically (but not ideologically) a clone of the scout move ment, which had arrived in Russia on the eve of WWI.

June 28th, 2014. The fact that no monographic studies on &gt;childhood during WWI&lt; are available proves that it has not been sufficiently investigated. So far, most researchers have considered wartime childhood ignoring the close connection to the preceding and the subsequent periods. Thus, there are hardly any studies on childhood dur ing the Russo-Japanese war (1904-1905), which also induced an unprecedented upsurge of child patriotism, or the numerous wars that Russia was part of in the 19th century and earlier. By examining the problem of &gt;children and the war&lt;</page><page sequence="14">126 Olga llyukha in a wide historical range one can discern the persistent, cross-century features in the behaviour of children during wars, see the attitudes of children towards war at different times in history, and measure the responsibility of adults for the information children are exposed to. A key issue that needs to be thoroughly addressed by researchers within this topic is identification of the determinant factors behind the formation of the spectrum of behavioural models of children during a war - indicating both adaptation and disadaptation - to eventually de termine how the psychology of Homo belli, &gt;man of war&lt; is formed.
