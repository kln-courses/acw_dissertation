THE RELIGIOUS INTERPRETATION OF RARYLONIAN SEALS AND A NEW PRAYER OF SHAMASH-SHUM-UK1N (BM. 78219) By St. LANGDON The text which accompanies this article is the first Semitic prayer to the grain goddess Nidaba now published and the first example of a. prayer in which the god and goddess of the penitent are actually named. Prayers of the atonement rituals usually have a formula to be filled in for the occasion when the penitent complétés the formula by naming his god and goddess1. The adaptable line usually runs ; — anaku annanna mar annanna sa ili-ëu annaana istarta-su annannatum " I such a one, son of such a one, whose god is such a one, whose goddess is such a one'." Here the layman filled in his name, his father's name and the names of his 1. The doctrine of spécial cuit attachaient and the belief in a protecting god and goddess is of Suraerian origin as will be shewn'below. It is extremely probable that the Sumerians did not receive their officiai naraes until the âge of puberity when each person formally received a name indicating his c-'t attachaient. See the article on Sumerian Names in Hasting's Encyclo/jedia of Religion and Et/iics. Semitic names are often based upon the same principle but here the rule does not regularly obtain. See Krausz, Die Gôttcr namen in den Babylonischen Siegel cylimler legenden, 3 ff. Poebel's hostile criticism in OLZ., 1913, 62 f., in which he denied that seals are ordinarily dedicated to the man's personal god is certainly erroneous. Poebkl failed to distinguish the motifs of the figured scenes from the meaning conveyed by the accompanying in scription. See below. 2. The formula was generally known from Assyrian copies of prayers. For its use in Babylonian texts see Pinches, PSBA., 1909, 62, 17. In copies used at Assur, RA., 13, 109, 19.

Ebeling, Religiôse Keilschrift texte aus Assur, No. 55, is an incantation prayer as recited by Asurbanipal1. In place of the regular formula it has ana-ku Asur-bani-pal mar ili-su, "I A. son of liis god". A well known prayer to the sun-god was adapted for the use of Shamash shum-ukîn and here also the adaptable phrase is replaced by ana-ku ilw Shamas-shum ukîn mar ili-su, Myhrman, Babylonian Hymns and Prayers, No. 12. In the Pro ceedings of the Society of Biblical Archœology, 1918, 104-110, the writer published BM. 78432, a prayer to the moon-god as adapted for Shamash-shum-ukîn. Here the formula is simply [anaku iluSamas-]sum-uktn arad-ka, "I S. thy servant". For these reasons I wrote in the Reoue d'Assyriologie, XIII, 102, in the belief that these adaptable formulae were a héritage from the Sumerians retained in writing but obsolete in practice. I there stated my conviction that the penitent gave only his name omitting that of his father and did not mention any god and goddess by name. The argument was that the Semites rejected the belief that the great gods became protecting deities of individuals. This statement rested upon a misunderstanding. When the penitent said that his god is such an one he did mean one of the greater deities, his protecting genius, by which he became mar ili-su, "sop of his god". The greater deities became "a man's god", his inner dwelling spiritual protector. When the prayers state that a man's god is such and such and his goddess such and such they refer to the custom by which each Babylonian was specially devoted to the cuit of a great god and goddess. The prayer on BM. 78219 is of the greatest possible importance on this point for it contains the formula of prayers properly filled up ; — I Shamash-shum-ukîn son of his god, Whose god is Marduk, whose goddess is Zarpanit. The god of this prince was, therefore, Marduk. A fragment of a prayer by Shamash-shum-ukîn to Marduk is published by Myhrman, ibid., No. 18, in which he speaks of himself simply as [anaku] arad-ka ilu Samas-sum-ukîn (1. 18), "I thy servant S. ". But in BM. 78432 he speaks to the moon god as " I thy servant The term arad-ka " thy servant" has here only a général import!. It does not désignât© 1. Another prayer as used by Asurbanipal has been published. King, Magic, No. 27 (K. 2371 +13791), is a prayer to Nergal which has (line ll)Hhe formula anaku annannu mar annanni arcid-ka, "I some one, son of some one, thy servant Here ardu servant is employed of Nergal by any worshipper who chose to use this hymn, and does not describe the penitent as a spécial devotee of Nergal. But K. 2836 + K. 6593, a variant of this prayer, has the formula completed as follows anaku Asur-bani-apli arad-ka, "I Asurbanipal thy servant". The formula is similar to that of BM. 78432. 2. See the preceding note.</page><page sequence="3">THE RELIGIOUS INTERPRETATION OF BABYLONIAN SEALS 51 a person as the spécial devotee of any one god1. On the other hand consécration to the cuit of a god and his consort carried with it the title pâlifiu, the fearer. Thus Shamash-shum-ukîn would be described as pûlih iluMarduk, pâlit} ilat Zarpanitum. A man may be the devotee of two gods!; so the owner and copist of the syllabary, CT., 12, 3, 26, Nabu-kusur the amel bappir iluNabu banda(da), the inferior butler of Nebo, calls himself pa-lih i-luBêl u ilujSlabu, devotee of Marduk and Nebo. The same scribe ordinarily appears as pâli(i iluNabû, CT., 12, 7, Colophon; 12, 9, Colo phon. But in CT., 12,17, Colophon, he is sa iluNabû palhu, " He who fears Nebo 3 These facts, espëcially clarified by the fragment here published, render our under-, standing of several fundamental dogmas of the Babylonian religion much more definite. A man is mqr ili-su " son of his god " with reference to his own god. This protecting genius is to be identified with the great god and his consort to whose cuit an individual was attached. A passage from a similar prayer to Shamash has; — Daily I soine one^ son of his god, Whose god is such an one, whose goddess is such an one, Stand before thy divinity*. According to the fragment published here this formula was completed in some such way as this ; — Daily I, Nabukusur, son of his god, Whose god is Nebo, whose goddess is Tashmet, Stand before thy divinity. 1. Babylonian seals of the periods of Ur and the first Babylonian dynasty usually carry the name of a god, his titles, the naine of the owner, his father's name, and the epithet eri-su = arad-ka. For example Babyloniaca, III, 238, the seal of a Semite Nur-at)i-su has the inscription " Ninshubur faithful messenger of heaven, who holds a sbining scepter, Nurahishu son of llishu-ibishu, thy servant". The epithet "thy ser vant " probably désignâtes Ninshubur as the spécial god of Nurahishu, in this and similar cases. 2. If arad on seals may be taken to dénoté dedication to a spécial cuit then dual dedication must be assumed on a seal of the period of Rim-Sin, PSBA., 1917, PI. IX, " Ishtar, son of Imgur-Sin, servant of Dagan and Ninshubur." 3. pâli/} in these cases clearly désignâtes the individual as the spécial devotee of the gods in question. When p&amp;lif}, followed by the name of a deity-, is employed as a title the word has this restricted and con ventional sense. And {île same statement is probably true for the term arad. Note the same restricted use of the term as devotee in kl la pâlif}. ili-t u istari-l anaku cpèek, " 1 am treated as one who is not a devotee of my god and goddess i.'e., as one who is not attached to any cuit, King, Création, Appendix, V, 68. On the other hand pâlih may be employed in a général sense similar to ardu. For example a prayer to Ninurta arranged for général use has silim itti ja atû pa-tifj-ka, " Be gracious with me, a watchman, thy worshipper King, Magic, 2, 35. This prayer was written for ail Babylonians and Assyrians the majority of whom weré probably not devotees of Ninurta. Note also, for the général use of this word, the phase of Nabuna'id pa U-ijy ilâni a istari anaku, Neu-babylonische Kônigsinschriften, 252, No. 6, 9. On the other hand a hymn to Nebuchadnezzar II, chiefly addressed to Nebo, at the end, PSBA., 1898,157, 14-20, contains a short address, to Marduk who was probably the spécial deity of this famous king. Line 16 has pa-li-i(j.-su binûtu kati-[èu], " His devotee, the création of his hand Nebo is not referred to in this hymn in any such intimate relation to the king. 4. Babyloniaca, III, 25 , 39 f.</page><page sequence="4">52 ST. LANGDON The entire doctrine of spécial cuit attachaient whereby every orthodox person was described as " son of his god" is of Sumerian origin. The evidence of the Sumerian seals is not clear for the decisive title " my god, his god" never occurs here. A definite source for the doctrine occurs in a Sumerian incantation of the sériés é nu sub, Babyloniaca, III, 15, 28, lù-gâl clumu dingir-ra-ni, " the man son of his god 1 It is attractive to believe that the Sun^erians, once having formulated the doctrine that each individual is the création of some great god and attached to his cuit, na turally dedicated their seals to their own nrotecting deities in most instances®. But not until the period of the Ur dynasty do we obtain seals addressed to deities and bearing inscriptions which lend theraselves as evidence of this doctrine. A seal from Umma dated in the reign of Dungi lias;,— Lu-Ninshubur servant of the god Shara3. A tablet inscribed with the détails of the sale of a house bears the seal of the seller ; — Sinmagir son of Ninurta-gamil servant of Ninsianna and Kabta '. The follçwing legends are characteristic of seals in this period. Abil-i-li-su, son of Ninurtagamil, servant of Dagan5. Sin-ra'im-Uri-(ki), son of Sin-ikisham, servant of Shamash and Ajac. Eriâti-ilatAja, consecrated woman of Shamash, daughter of Sharrum-Adad, servant7 of Shamash ®. From the last mentioned seal we liave evidence that women stood in the same relation to one of the great gods as men themselves, that is, if we mày interpret ardu, ardat on seals in the sense of devotee of a spécial god. Since in the extensive incan tation and prayer literature women are never referred to, this remarkable fact was noted in my outlirte of Babylonian magie9 and it was suggested that perhaps women 1.

"Under normal conditions each individual is guarded by a divine spirit or god. He is called the " man's god" and man is defined in a religious sense as " son of his god". There are no exaraples of females to whom this définition is applied. This can hardly be attributed to accident, for our sources mention hundreds even thousands of men who were bewitched and whose gods abandoned them, but never a woman. I fail to understand this aspect of their religion. According to their civil laws women held an extremely high position in society, they were often priestesses and consecrated to religious orders. But although women are constantly mentioned as having power to bring about the condition of tabu, yet they are never mentioned as fallen to the powers of the devils or witches, or as being under the protection of a personal god. It might be added that they never appear in the private penetential psalms. Unless some sound reason can be brought forward for this almost total exclusion of women from the scope of religion and the interests of the gods I shall assume, when the texts refer to sinners, sufferers and penitents by the title "son of his god", that the défi nition might apply to women also. " The fact, that the formulae in the prayers is worded so as to be filled in by men only, led me to raise the question as to whether women were supposed to have a personal god and whether they ever employed the rituals of incantation and prayers at ail. The striking fact that they never appear in prayers and incantations was, however, correctly attributed to the fact that the orthodox texts were worded es pecially for men, but that women were included and held an equal standing with men in their relation to the gods. The seal cited above may be adduced to prove that every woman was devoted to a spécial cuit whether they were priestesses or not. Like, men the devils also attacked females and overpowered their indwelling gods. This statement is supported in a Sumerian source accompanied by a Semitic trans lation ; — (The demons),,in the city and land cause wailing, small and great they cause to cry. Man and woman they bind, filling them with lamentation'. Direct and most important evidence for the religious position of women in Sumer and Babylonia is furnished by a unique and remarkable bilingual incantation for a woman in child-birth\ In this text the women is called; — sal-bi sàl-dumu dingir-ra-na sinnistum si mar-ti ili-âu This woman daughter of her god '. 1.

LANGDON Obviously, then, a woman reciting one of the incantation prayers would say for example ; — - I, Eristi-Aja, daughter of Sharrum-Adad, whose god is Shamash, whose goddess is Aja. Or, in case, tlie other formula was preferred she would adapt the formula às follows ; — I, Erisbti-Aja, daughter of her god, Whose god is Shamash, whose goddess is Aja. No incantation prayers are known prior to the period of the Assyrian kings Asarhaddon and Asurbanipal. The Assyrian incantation sériés are ail copies from Babylonian sources, but at present few Babylonian texts of this kind have been recovered. The period in which long incantation sériés, interspersed with prayers of the lifting of the hand, were first introduced and received their final arrangement, was most probably that of the first Babylonian dynasty. We have seen that a Su merian text of the Isin period, contemporary with the first half of this Babylonian dynasty, already contains the phrase "son of his god", and seal inscriptions now begin to carry the phrase servant of a god. In ordinary religious texts a believer may be the servant of any god. The evidence of the seals would have been more conclusive as sources for the doctrine of the divine sonship and attachment to spécial cuits if they had carried the phrase pâlih, " worshipper ", or "whose god is such and such". Never the less it is wellnigh certain that the adaptable formulae of the Semitic prayers of the lifting of the hand were introduced in this period. Seals from the âge of Sargon the ancient, of Gudea and of Dungi, generally contain the name of the owner and his father's name simply or they are*dedicated to the reigning king or to a high officiai. For example we have on a seal of the dynasty of Agade; — Eri-dTud son of Dudu The seal of the Sumerian ruler of Lagash, Lugalanda, a half century anterior to the dynasty of Sargon carries one of the oldest seal inscriptions; — Lugalanda, the nu-ku-mal priest king of Lagash 3. From the same pre-Sargonic period the seal of Eniggal a scribe will illustrate the simplicity and untheological import of glyptic inscriptions in the early period ; — Eniggal, scribe of the house of the queen consort'. 1.

Thus we see that seals of the earliest (pre-Sargonic period) were generally simple identifications of individuals with no religious signification whatsoever. From these scanty sources it would be hazardous to argue ex silêntio that the most ancient Su merians and Semites had not yet adopted the belief in a personal god to whose cuit they were attached, who in a mystic sense abode in their bodies and whose sons and daughters they were. At any rate the phrase ' ' son of his god " symbolises a profound doctrine of the Sumerian religion which is seldom reflected on seal inscriptions in any way whatsoever before the âge of Dungi. Coming now to the seal inscriptions of the âge of Sargon the ancient we meet with a style still purely secular and one which continued in use in the periods of Gudea and Dungi. Characteristic of this second epigraphical period of glyptic in scriptions is the dedieation of the seal to the reigning monarch or to a high officiai \ Seals of the kings themselves followed the old style giving simply the name of the owner and a royal title. The. following inscriptions will illustrate the personal défi nition of individuals in these periods ; — To Shargalisharri, king of Akkad, Ibni-sharrum the scribe thy servant®. To Ubil-Asdar, brother of the king, Kalki the scribe, thy servant". To Gudea, priest king of Lagash, Lugal-me the scribe thy servant'. On the other hand the seal of this ruler who owed allegiance to no monarch has simply ; — Gudea priest king of Lagash *. 1. Toscane in Reo. d'Aasyriologie, 7, 57. 2.

LANGDON In the period of the five famous kings of Ur we naturally expect to find a large number of seals dedicated to these rulers, for not only were they rulers of an extensive empire but they received apotheosis and were revered as gods. Consequently a large number of their subjects profess themselves to be their servants, and dedicate their seals to them. Here again arad-su " tliy servant" which characterises seal inscrip tions in the periods of Sargon and Gudea has a purely secular significance and probably defines the owner as an officiai in the service of the crown or of some state officiai ; — To Ur-dEngur, the mighty man, king of Ur, Hashhamar priest King of Ishkun-Sin thy servant1. To Dungi, the mighty man, king of Ur, king of Sumer and Akkad, Ur-dShulpae son of Lani the superior minister, thy servant2. That the title arad-.su " thy servant" has in this type of inscription no religious significance is proven by the seal of the son of Bur-Sin where the title is omitted ; — To Bur-Sin, the mighty man, king of Ur, king of the four régions, Ur-Bau his son *. But many seals of this period revert to the. older form and do not describe the person as the servant of a great dignitary ;— Lugalurrani, son of Ukush, the baker*. Puria son of Abanum the kizû! ofïïcer. To this period we must probably assign the origin and acceptance of the dogma concerning the relation of each individual to a deity. The title " son of his" god has not yet been recovered. Incantations in which this phrase occurs have not been preserved from the âge of Ur, but seal inscriptions now begin to reveal religious motifs. Muhadum servant of Nergal Atarish servant of the god Amurrû'. To this period belongs the cuit dedication (cjuriously modeled after the style of the dedications to dignitaries), Babylaniaca, III, 238; — To Ninshubur, faithful messenger of heaven, bearer of the holy wand, Nurahishu, son of Ilishu-ibi-shu, thy servant. 1.

Ibid., 119.</page><page sequence="9">THE religious INTERPRETATION OF BABYLONIAN SEALS 57 Here is another example of the new type of religious inscriptions ; — Ishar-ili, son of Gimil-lu-ni, servant of Ishtar(?)\ In this period the parallel practice of inscribing simply the names of a man's god and goddess on his seal became common, " Shamash and Aja! " Ishtar and Tam muz3", " Adad and Shala"'. The dogma of spécial consécration to a god and his consort, if this be the underlying idea of these seal inscriptions, does not seem to have obtained universal acceptance in the period of the dynasty of Ur\ By far the greater number of seals bear simply the name of the owner, his father's name (rarely omitted) and frequently a title. Or they belong to the class of seals dedicated to a dignitary. The doctrine of spécial cuit attachment, of an indwelling deity, becomes the foremost belief in the personal religion of the Babylonians only in the succeeding era of Isin and Babylon. Seals of this period almost invariably refer to the owner's protecting god or carry simply the names of his god and goddess. Apil-ili-shu, son of Narâm-ili-shu, servant of the god Shahan6. Apil-ili-shu. son of Ninurta-gamil, servant of the god Dagan'. It should be noted, however, that inscriptions of the pre-Sargonic period already designate a certain god as a man's god dingir-ra-ni. The earliest family of rulers at Lagash" always refer to the god /Jan-X" as their personal god. Note the parti cularly interesting epilogue to the inscription of Entemena in Clay, Miscellaneous Inscriptions, No. 4; — "May his god dDun-X. for his life to Ningirsu in Eninnû prayer lift up.

LANGDON turban universally characteristic of divinity. Sometimes the conducted man carries a goat or fruit branch as sacrificial ofïering, sometimes an attendant mortal brings the offering. On the Morgan seal the mortal is followed by two attendant deities one apparently carrying a goat. In any case the man's goddess who stands behind him on the stereotyped scene of the Gudea and Dungi periods appears on one very early seal assisting the man's god in the intercession'. We may conclude from these' glyptic scenes of the periode of Agade and especially from the pre-Sargonic inscrip tions of Ur-Ninà and his successors that the Sumerians accepted this doctrine of spécial cuit attachment to a great deity and had extended the belief to include the god's consort. Whether they yet held the belief so characteristic of later Sumerian incantations that a man's god was actually present in the bodies of his protégés may bs regarded as doubtful. The thesis that these seals are based upon incantation rituals has not been suggested but this explanation appears to be the only one which receives solid sup port from Sumerian rituals and beliefs. If the owner of a seal was especially de dicated to the cuit of a god and his divine consort, if he believed that these deities were ever present in his body to defend him against the devils, if he believed that in time of trouble his god and goddess interceded for him before the great water god whose oath and lioly water loosed from the bans of the devils, what could be more natural than to represent himself on his own seal as led into the presence of this great deity by his own god and attended by his own goddess ? In a few cases the seated deity is obviously the sun god Shamash who is also a deity of lustration and power over the devils. When we look at the scene on Ward, $78, a seal of the period of Agade on which is depicted the owner being led to Shamash by his own protecting god, the following lines from a Sumerian incantation against the démons seem to describe the owner's idea in causing this seal to be made ; — By the command of Ea may the mun, son of his god, Be pure, be clean, be bright. Likè a water bottle may he be washed. Like a butter jar may he be purified. Unto Shamash chieftain of the gods entrust him. 1. This important seal proves that the belief in a protecting god and goddess belongs to the earliest Su merian period. The owner of the seal is bearded and stands with both hands folded at the waist behind his god and goddess who present him to a seated divinity. The divinity bolds the overflowing water jar. Seal in the Louvre first published by Menant, Glyptique Orientale, Vol. I, p. 111. See also Ward, Seal Cylinders, No. 28". The dedication of a seal to a man's god and goddess in the period of Sargon is also illustrated by the incantation seal, Ward, 453 c, which carries the names of Pabilsag and his consort Gula, the deities of Larak.</page><page sequence="11">THE RELIGIOUS INTERPRETATION OF BABYLONIAN SEALS 59 And may Shamash chieftain of the gods in peace Restore him into the kind hands ot his god'. The interprétation which identifies these présentation scenes with the rituals of atonement receives support from a group of seals of the pre-Sargonic and Sargonic period on which the owner of the seal represents himself being attacked by one or more of the seven devils. This motif was unknown in glyptic art before Ward pu blished a small group of such seals Nos. 453, 453 a, 453 6, 454 6, 454c, and 453c .on page 169 of his Seal Cylinders of Western Asia These seals of utmost importance in the history of Babylonian religion have apparently rested in the British Muséum, the Metropolitan Muséum of New York City and, previous to foundation of the Pier- ' pont Morgan Library, in private collections for a long period unnoticed and unstudied. On seal 453 (British Muséum) the owner is attacked by a winged dragon and a lion. In the left field a lion attacks an antelope*. Ward (page 160) supposed that both dragon and lion represented Nergal*. He was quick to observe the obvious connec tion between the winged dragon with bird legs and pantherlike head and the démons figured on the backs of two bronze talismans whose obverses represent the devils and incantation scenes5. This dragon with bird legs, claw fingered hands, scorpion tail, and grimacing animal face is now generally identified with the fever démon Labartu". Also one small silver and two bronze figures of a similar démon have been found7. These have been generally interpreted as representing the wind démons. Ail are four winged and probably belong to a somewhat late period. The dragon on early seals 1. CT., 16, 11, VI, 31-42. 2.

Heuzey, including in his studyonly those seals where the Sun god combats the démons, supposed that in these scenes a denion*'of darkness opposes Shamash as he approaches the western horizon. 5. Only the famous bronze talisman of the Collection de Clercq lormerly supposed to represent a funeral and scenes from Hades was known to Ward. A similar one was discovered by Scheil in Constantinople. For reproductions of both see Frank, Babylonische Beschworungsreliefs, Tafeln I-IV. 6. This identification rests upon an inscription on a stone talisman in Berlin published by Weissbach, Miscellen, Taf. 15; see Frank, ibid., 75. Since the inscription is a duplicate of the first eight lines of the La bartu sériés and the talisman represents the same incantation scenes as the two bronze incantation tablets mentioned above, the dragon on the back of these bronze tablets is supposed to be Labartu although this figure is absent on the Berlin tablet. 7.

LANGDON has only two wings. The lion which attacks the owner of the seal is one of the seven devils1. That is proven by the représentation of the seven devils on the de Clercq bronze relief. Here the seven devils are conventionalised forms of the pan ther, lion, dog, sheep, ram, bird and serpent. On seal 454 a the lion devil and the Labartu démon join hands and greet each other in joy at their mutual wickedness. On the third register of the de Clercq bronze the lion and panther greet each other in a very similar attitude before the bed of a patient whom they have laid in their toils. Finally a conclusive argument for the interprétation of these seals on the sup position that they represent man and beast attacked by the devils are the left portions of the scenes on Ward, Nos. 453 and 453 c*. On each seal the lion démon attacks an antelope or a goat; the lion on 453 c has wings. On seal 454 b it is apparently the bird limbed dragon that attacks a goat. [Seal 453 c is dedicated to dGula and Pabilsag" the ovvner's god and goddess. 454 6 is dedicated to Shamash.] These scenes are well illustrated by a passage from a Sumerian incantation ; — The cattle which thrive in the plain (the démon) seized upon. The wild goats, the antelope, and the rams afar(?) he caused to go. The kid and the full grown kid of the field he seized. The kid and the fail grown kid he hunted. Like the wind he overwhelmed, like lightning he struck down1. The saine anxiety of man both for himself and his cattle is revealed on a seal of the Cassite period, Menant, La Haye, No. 27 ; — Sparing, having mercy, delivering, restoring of health, cattle and garden, name and life, may these exist for me rightly. And as a commentary on the scene which depicts the onslaught of the démons upon man, from an extensive literature the followiug is most applicable; — Headache rushed over the plain hastening like the wind. Like lightning it flared, above and beneath it pervades. Ilim that fears not his god 5 like a reed it rends. 1. The idea continues in the glyptic of the Hammurabi period. See Delaporte, l. c., 266, the owner of the seal assaulted by winged dragon, bird limbs and fantastic body and head. On the left a lion démon assaults the antelope. The man's god and goddess are Shamash and Aja. See also 269, 270, etc. 2. See also No. 59 of Delapobte's Catalogue du Musée Guimel. 3.

The group of incantation seals published by Ward reveal also their origin in the most ancient period by the rétention of scenes from the legend of Gilgamish and Enkidu. Another cylinder from a collection in Petrograd published by Ward as No. 300 a of his opus magnum shevvs the lion headed devil, here with human body, captured by the sun-god and brought before the seated sun-god ; a priest assists in the binding of the démon. The owner of the seal stands behind the seated god, a respectful observer of the binding and condemnation of his persecutor. The anomaly of the double rôle of Shamash on this seal is probably due to the fact that the sun-god was supposed to pass judgement on the' démons and that he was also the god of the owner of the seal. The man's god with the aid of the aèipu priest leads the man's evil foe bound into the presence of the great judge. It must, however, be admitted that in later texts the water god Ea, the various tire gods and the grain goddesses are the powers which dispose of the devils. This seal is illustrated in part by the words of an asipu priest as he enters the house of a man possessed by a démon; — When I enter into the house, May Shamash go before me, may Sin go behind me. May Nergal go at my right, May Ninurta go at my lefts. On many ancient seals the sun-god is represented in conflict with the démons. The owner of the seal thus commémorâtes his escape from the devils. Seal No. 68 of the Bibliothèque Nationale in Delaporte's Catalogue represents Shamash over powering two of the seven devils. Here the artist preserves for us the most ancient conception of the e-vil spirits ; sons of the heaven god and children of the earth they are of divine origin and by descent equal to the great gods \ They are the seven evil gods say the incantation texts .

LANGDON were probably represented in art and described in legend as anthropomorphic gods precisely as the great gods of civilisation themselves. One of the seven devils is called ilu limnu "the evil god" simply. Consequently when we find one of the great gods, most frequently Shamash, in conflict with a hostile deity as on the seals collected by Ward, Nos. 136-140 6, the scene is almost certainly to be interpreted by reference to incantation texts. Note for example Ward, 140 6' ; Shamash subdues the démon who had bound the owner of the seal and the man's god stands in adoration before the great water deity Ea, god of atonement. On the seal of Asdar (?) nawir Shamash on the left destroys the ilu limnu, the god of evil and on the right lie subdues another of the devils represented as a god with menacing and horrible dog face8. We are now in the period of transition when the evil gods were being transformed into animais3 On a number of these seals the démon is repre sented issuing from the mountains and in one case the sun-god comes into conflict with the ''evil god" as he rises from the eastern mountains*. Passages from incan tation texts fully illustrate this legend concerning the lairs of the seven devils ; — Headache from the mountain house has gone forth. From the house of Enlil it has gone fortb. •vFrom the midst of the mountains it has descended upon the land. From the ends of the mountains upon the land it has descended. From the plains it has descended not to be turned back. From the mountain goats unto the cattle stalls it has descended. From the antelope unto the split horned* it has descended, From the split horned unto the great horned6 it has descended7. We have here again reference to the hostility of the démons towards the wild and domestic animais. Cattle plagues were classifîed with human diseases and attri buted to the démons. Since Sumerian and Babylonian economic life depended so largely upon property in live stock and the wellfare of the cattle so seriously con cerned the interests of wealthy land owners it is not surprising that a man's god was supposed to protect his cattle also. Naturally we may not infer for animais the same mystic presence of a man's god and goddess in his person. Hovvever, I would on 1. Same seal in Delaportr, 73. 2. Dblaporte, l. c., No. 68. 3.

On the ancient seal of the Bibliothèque Nationale, Delaporte, 79, the owner commémorâtes the deliveranCe of his flocks from a démon. He himself and an attendant bring each a kid as oflering to a god and a wild goat leaps toward the protecting and delivering god of the flocks. On this principle of representing the conquest of démons who have assaulted the owner's cattle I would explain the bull which leaps into the lap of an agricultural deity Ward, Nos. 317, 318. On 317 the owner's goddess accompanies him. A large number of seals of the Ur period re present an unidentifîed animal leaping into the lap of a seated god1. On others the crab is placed before the seated divinity. For these animais no explanation can be given on the basis of incantation beliefs and practices. In the glyptic of Sumer and Akkad, legend, the rituals of atonement and astrological fantasy are often strangely intermingled. In any case the figures of lions8, dogs3, bulls4 placed directly behind the thrones of deities have, I believe, direct reference to demonology. The owners of the seals commemorate the expulsion of the démons from their flocks, domestic animais and wild animais. Vases, the priest vvith pouring water jar, censers, altars and varions unidentified utensils of glyptic art from the âge of Gudea onward surely refer to the rituals of atonement. Especially characteristic of the Ur dynasty is the scene in which the owner of the seal is led by the hand of his own god or goddess into the presence of a great deity to whom he prays (su-il-la) in the ceremony of atonement or to whom he appeals in a simply liturgical prayer (er-sag-hun-gà)s. Simple religious scenes of this kind which characterize the glyptic of Gudea and Ur, when they have no obvious connection with incantation, I would explain as representing the owner saying a liturgical prayer of private dévotion, always conducted in Sumerian. Sometimes the man's goddess leads him to the deity6. The particular passage in these Sume rian prayers of private pennance, always acts of pure spiritual dévotion and un connected with magie ritual, which these scenes illustrate is the following ; — May my god, lord of prayer, address a prayer unto thee. 1.

I believe that these seals are based upon the ceremonies of private pennanee in which the man's god and goddess are implored to assist him in bis prayer to a great god. Or in many cases they represent scenes and ideas of the rituals of atonement in which a man's god and goddess assist the priests in overcoming the démons who have beset him and his flocks and the wild animais of the chase. For furthçr illustrations of the scenes based upon simple penetential prayers the following may be cited. In an erèaghunga to the goddess Aja wife of the sun-god the penitent addressed to her these line? ; — My god lias made supplication unto thee, may thy heart repose. My goddess has spoken intercession unto thee, may thy soul repose'. In a prayer of pennanee in which the priest alternâtes with the supplicant in addressing a goddess (Ishtar ?) the priest intervenes with the following line; — His god and goddess who are paiped with him cry out unto thee3. A similar liturgical prayer to Enlil has a passage taken by the priest on behalf of the penitent ; —■ May his god who is moved to intercede speak prayer unto thees If the scenes on seals extending from the earliest period to the end of the dynasty of Ur which represent a human led into the presence of a deity by a god or goddess have been correctly interpreted, then the seated deity can in no case be the indivi dual's personal god. Hé is the god to whom lie prays and his god and goddess intercede for him. The psalms of private pennanee leave only one conclusion pos sible. These deities assisted him in his prayers. The same statement is necessarily true of the prayers intercalated in the rituals of atonement. Here the penitent calls himself the son of his god and tells the god to whom lie prays the names of his personal god and goddess. The Ur period begins to replace the scene of a mortal led by the hand of his god or goddess by another whose motif finally suppressed the earlier processional scene altogether.

These seated deities are the deified kings of the period. Behind the owner of the seal stands the man's goddess with both hands raised in act of adoration1. The great emphasis henceforth placed upon the interceding figure of the mother goddess, of whatever type the man's goddess may have been, in glyptic art coincides with her unrivaled position in the liturgical literature of the period. The great mother goddess both in public song services and in the prayers of the private penetential was constantly appealed to as the deity who concerned herself most passionately with mankind. In the Sumerian liturgies she stands in a rela tion to men entirely différent from that of the great maie deities. The sorrows of men are her sorrows and she is represented in ail these song services as wailing over human calamities*. Consequentlv seals of the Hammurabi period reject the old scene of the mortal led by the hand altogether and almost invariably represent the interceding mother goddess standing behind her protégé. Now the seated divinity generally wears the horned turban for emperor worship had been abandoned. The mortal now ordinarily stands in the attitude of one saying the .prayers of the lifting of the hand (su-il-la). Generally the left hand is raised and the right folded at the waist. Or if he brings a lamb or kid in his left arm the disengaged right arm is raised3. More often the animal is presented to the seated or standing deity with both hands. Seals of this type reflect the increasing influence of the incantation rituals. These are taken from the Semitic prayers of the magie rituals in which the penitent often brings a sacrificial animal. Theological tendencies are clearly reflected in the glyptic of the various periods. The interceding goddess owes her extraordinary ubiquity on seals of the Ur and Hammurabi periods to the rise of liturgies and the overshadowing importance of the mater dolorosa in these liturgies. The older scene of the mortal led by the hand reflects the older psalms of the private penitential not 1. Delaporte, opus laud., p. xm, discovered the chronological principles of glyptio in eatly Sumerian art. For seals with this motif see Nos. 98-123 of his volume. 2. See for the liturgical type of the mother goddess the writer's Tarn mu 3 and Ishtar, p. 111. In this connection the writer calls attention to his rendering of the Sumerian verb tud when emplôyed of a mother goddess by the English " beget ". Two of his critics have objected to this rendering on the ground that *' beget " in English is emplôyed only of a father. The choiee of this rendering was made in order to make a logical translation, for Sumerian employs the verb tud as well as synonomous verbs ugu, gan for both father and mother. Moreover the mother goddess was clearly conceived of as bi-sexual and capable of conceiving of herself. See 'Tammus and Ishtar, pp. 4 S. The writer lias been unable to understand the Sumerian point of view in regard to the principles of procréation. The Semite is guilty of the same inconséquence using the verb banû indifïerently for both father and mother. 3. Delaporte, 162, etc. Reçue d'AssyrioLogie, X</page><page sequence="18">66 ST. LANGDON attended by magie. The figure of the deified god without horned turban reflects the sway of that intensified emperor worship of the Ur and Isin dynasties. The mortal with uplifted hand reflects the incantations and prayers of the private atonement which began to have enormous vogue in the Isin period and dominate Babylonian religion to the end of its history ". The figure of the uplifted left hand occurs rarely in very ancient Sumerian glyptic (Delaporte, l. c., 53, 81; Musée Guimet, 25, 26) and disappears to reappear a milenium later in the revival of prayers of the lifting of the hand in magie rituals. The principal idea underlying the scènes which men usuallv inscribed upon their private seals from the most ancient times to the end of the first Babylonian dynasty is based upon demonology and spiritism. " Man son ofhisgod" is the deep reli gious belief revealed in one way or another according to the dominating idea of the period. On Cassite seals the engraved scene recedes in importance. The owner when depicted preserves the attitude of prayer of the preceding period'. The interceding mother goddess rarely appears'. The seal now becomes à talisman and a charm with a long inscription generally addressed to the owner's protecting god. In view of their vital importance for the religions interprétation of seals I have collected and edited ail the published Cassite seal inscriptions in the article which follows directly upon the present one. On Assyrian seals the relation of the owner of a seal to his god and goddess is not referred to either by inscriptions which are almost universally absent nor in the engraved scenes themselves. Worsluppers do not imfrequently appear on Assyrian seals but the position of the hands is moraj$k£ that of'tfes Egyptian worshipper. The owners liere seem to be "ret&gt;sesented'û©t in th# aci of saying the prayers of private pennance (ersaghunga) or the attwvoment but in 'the act of général worship.

And Assyrian glyptic replaces tli# old Babylonian in Babylonia itself 1. A large number of Sumerian incantations of the type published by Thompson in CT., XVI-XVII have been exoavated at Nippur and belong to the Isin period. These do not contain su-Ll-la prayer". In fact in cantation sériés like the bit rimki, bit sald mê, which consist of Semitic prayers of the lifting of the hand accompanied by magie ceremonies seem to have been written by the Semites of the period in which the figure with uplifted hand appears on the seals. Old Sumerian Su-il-la prayers existed in scant number but they were not employed in magie rituals. 2. See for example Ward, No. 528. 3.
