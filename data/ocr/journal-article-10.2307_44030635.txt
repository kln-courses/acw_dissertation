<plain_text><page sequence="1">Informed by Roland Barthes's A Lover's Discourse , this essay considers visual and linguistic strategies in the film and the short story versions of Brokeback Mountain in order to explore key narrative figures - the loop, the post- card, the memorial, and the address - and how they convey affect in love and loss.

To many, aspects of Brokeback Mountain were deeply famil- iar because its protagonists' gestures and sentiments have been experienced by those who have fallen in love and lost the object of their affections. Brokeback Mountain is also a love story that puts into question categorical definitions of gayness and normative masculinity, and therefore it involves social politics and identity issues particular to geo- graphic contexts and historical situations (Patterson). Nonetheless, Brokeback Mountain the film also achieved strong identification and recognition across various parameters Mosaic 43/1 0027-1 276-07/00 1022$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">2 Mosaic 43/1 (March 2010) of gender, community, and nation (Hart 152). These are all aspects of Brokeback Mountain s immense magnetism and broad cultural resonance. It is, however, not the valence between identity politics and attributions of universality that I wish to pursue here. In recent criticism, these debates have been addressed intelligently and with great variety, implicating gender, genre themes, mass culture, and national cinema and lit- erature traditions.2 Alternatively, I would like to analyze the conduits of amorous feel- ing in the Brokeback Mountain narratives and the cultural mechanisms that function to grip the reader and viewer in such powerful emotional states. According to Pullen, "the performance of emotion is key to the progressive potential of Brokeback Mountain to tell a story of male homosexuality within the masculine genre of the frontier and the cowboy" (159). My goal is to identify and make visible the means by which emotion is conveyed in the rush of Brokeback Mountains sensations - in other words, to put my finger on some intangibles surrounding the joyful and painful feel- ings of subjects in love. Feelings of love transpired not only for Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist, the con- flicted cowboys in Brokeback Mountain , but also for the viewers and readers who fell into empathetic states of mourning for the characters' many losses as well as their own (Stacy, Reading dedication page; Holleran 13). In A Lover's Discourse , French literary critic, cultural theorist, and semiotician Roland Barthes writes that "identifications" occur when "the subject painfully identifies himself with some person (or character) who occupies the same position as himself in the amorous structure" (129). Not only watching the film but also reading the short story became, for many, obsessional activ- ities akin to a dysfunctional love affair. As Barthes so aptly states of the lover s delirious fall into these ambiguous states of intersubjectivity, of having but not-quite-having the Other: "I am engulfed, I succumb" (10). For some aficionados, a forced weaning from the Brokeback Mountain texts - as if from a pathological dependence - appears neces- sary (Kostos). "This can t go on" is a figure of speech identified by Barthes whereby "the sentiment of an accumulation of amorous sufferings explodes in this cry," and it is akin to Jack's iconic lamentation to Ennis: "I wish I knew how to quit you" (Barthes, Lovers 140; Proulx, "Brokeback" 21). "I am crazy," writes Barthes, further capturing the lover s plaintive dementia (120). Yet Barthes's ability to so deftly articulate this near-psychotic condition of love is also a paradox, which he readily admits: "I am mad to be in love, I am not mad to be able to say so. [. . .] I quite sanely describe my madness" (120). The tension sustained by the apparent impossibility of a "logical" or "systematic" discourse about love and the fact of having, nonetheless, written one is one of Barthes's contra- dictory achievements in A Lover's Discourse. Along parallel lines, Holleran points out the challenges faced by a critic of the film Brokeback Mountain: "Trying to analyze this</page><page sequence="3">Andrea D. Fitzpatrick 3 film is to reduce the claims it has on one's feelings; it's pointless to do so" (15). For many reasons (especially the force of loves sting and its irrationality), Barthes's insights from A Lovers Discourse can enrich our understanding of the set of interre- lated texts called Brokeback Mountain. A Lover's Discourse is not a dialogue between lovers but a roster of the words and phrases that are said repetitively - the lover speaking to himself - in a state of anxiety and obsession, in a "syntax" that is "perverse," with "no logic" (Barthes, Lover's 6). Barthes's compilation (a lexicon of words and figures of speech arranged alphabetically) exem- plifies the dozens of ways in which the experience of love is not about the sensations of comfort in the presence of the lover, but about disconnection, alienation, feeling bereft, and waiting for the Other. Barthes's collection of vexing emotions and compulsive behaviours is spiked with anxiety, pathos, even trauma, but also comedy, and it there- fore offers a qualification of notions of romantic love as purely blissful and fulfilling. According to Carol Mavor, "A Lovers Discourse is knitted into familiar cardigans of love, which give like a mother, even when it hurts or, perhaps, especially because it does hurt" (154). An attempt to impose structure on an unruly set of artistic and literary organ- isms, A Lover's Discourse is significant in offering semi-structural analysis to subject matter that is inherently nebulous and subjective. A Lovers Discourse is knowingly par- adoxical in its attempt to give form to states of pure feeling, to codify extreme emotions such as the feelings of being overwhelmed or pushed to the edge. Mavor describes this valence between the sensual and the analytical as follows: "The writing appetite of Barthes is a conflicted, but extremely beautiful gastronomy of withholding and hedo- nism (anorectic or ascetic and hedonistic)" (6). The list of figures in the table of contents expresses the "madness" of Barthes's endeavour to flesh out such figures as (to cite just a few): s'abîme/ to be engulfed, démons/ demons, écorché/ñayed, exil/ exile, incon- naissable/ unknowable, insupportable/ unbearable, jalousie/ jealousy, mutisme/ silence, ravissement/ ravishment, retentissement/ reverberation, and vouloir- saisir! will-to-possess. Further, A Lover's Discourse is, like his Camera Lucida and The Pleasure of the Text, characteristic of Barthes's late work in that he allows the structuralism and rationality of his earlier works to persist (albeit faintly, in the numerous chapter headings, which focus and narrow the themes) yet also to unravel, by his luxurious writing style and by his emotional choice of subject matter (obsessive love, mourning and memory, and the bliss of reading). To give more palpable structure to the heady, affective aura that surrounds Brokeback Mountain, Barthes's A Lover's Discourse offers a good foundation because it presents a set of recurring figures identified in a broad selection of literary, philo- sophic, and psychoanalytic texts. In a comparative sampling, Barthes's intertextual web</page><page sequence="4">4 Mosaic 43/1 (March 2010) draws from such diverse sources as Goethe's Werther, Freud, Lacan, and Plato's Symposium , and describes at length the behaviours, emotions, objects, and figures of speech that characterize the subject in love. In the Barthesian sense, figures are graph- ics, outlines, words, turns of phrase, bodies, positions, and emotions - fragments of meaning that convey the contingencies between language and image: "Figures take shape insofar as we can recognize, in passing discourse, something that has been read, heard, felt. The figure is outlined (like a sign) and memorable (like an image or a tale)" (4). Barthes s subject-in-love must constantly negotiate an "image-repertoire," the set of familiar figures, cultural poses, recognizable signs, and images that inform (if not sustain) his or her amorous subjectivity, that condition and construct his or her responses to the perilous process of love s unfolding (6). Figures are, of course, integral parts of the image-repertoire, and therefore Barthes s approach, which helps form a bridge between literary accounts of figures and their look as visual images, is ideally suited to analyzing a film adapted from a short story, as well as to progressive adaptation studies in general (which, according to James Naremore, is an evolving interdisciplinary niche between literature, film, and other cultural media like theatre, graphic novels, and television). This is pertinent to a reading of the short story "Brokeback Mountain" alongside its adaptation to the feature film because Barthes s conception of the image- repertoire fluidly breaks down borders between literary descriptions and their potential as visual images. Indeed, as the cultural mythologist for whom the linguistic and the visual are equally worthy of semiotic analysis, Barthes reads literature through an intensely visual paradigm: "The image is presented, pure and distinct as a letter: it is the letter of what pains me" (132). Informed by Barthes s discourse on love, what will be explored in the following pages are the ineffable qualities of rapture and anguish that permeate Brokeback Mountain. By drawing out a set of affective figures - namely, the loop, the postcard, the memorial, and the address, which propel the narrative in the Brokeback Mountain texts - a more nuanced understanding of these cultural phenomena will ensue, as will, one hopes, some insights on love itself. I approach these metaphoric object- images as figures in the Barthesian sense, where the visible form is as worthy of read- ing as the underlying symbolic content, where the intertextuality of an adaptation extends meaning beyond the scene at hand. To approach two of the Brokeback Mountain texts (the short story and the film) through a set of figures is rewarding because it enriches the metaphoric content within and across the texts and demon- strates the imbrication of the written word and the screen image. Inspired by a figure Barthes calls "Loves obscenity," I would like to study the figures of affect in Brokeback Mountain , to speak both analytically and emotionally, to explore the seduction of love from first to last sight ( Lovers 175).</page><page sequence="5">Andrea D. Fitzpatrick 5 Annie beginning Proulx but starts after the the short love affair story between "Brokeback the two Mountain" cowboy not protagonists, at the chronological Jack Twist beginning but after the love affair between the two cowboy protagonists, Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar, has abruptly ended due to Jack's untimely and violent death. When the reader first encounters Ennis, he is barely middle-aged but old in spirit, living tem- porarily in a shabby trailer and in need of ranch work. Although, with her short story collections Close Range and Bad Dirty Proulx is known for the bleakness of her rural Wyoming environments and the harshness of the situations in which her characters find themselves (Moore), "Brokeback Mountain" also offers rare romantic delicacy, which is exceptional in its tenderness and dazzling aesthetics. In the opening paragraph, Proulx hints at the effects of two men, the surprise of love, and the rustic mountain environ- ment where that love flourished one brief summer in Wyoming in 1963, two decades prior to this moment. She mentions that "the shirts hanging on a nail shudder slightly in the draft," and that Ennis is graced with morning lust, "suffused with a sense of pleas- ure because Jack Twist was in his dream" (1). The fleeting sensations of Ennis's dream are conveyed by the extremes of temperature, sensual elements that course through the story: "If he does not force his attention on it, it might stoke the day, rewarm that old, cold time on the mountain when they owned the world and nothing seemed wrong" ( 1 ). Ennis's memory of Jack needs gentle attention the way a campfire flame needs tend- ing, and thus Proulx alludes to the activities that brought the two men together in an intimate way on the mountain. Although there is a sliver of pleasure, a sense of dread also permeates "Brokeback Mountain" from the first page. Ennis is trying to resuscitate a dream of Jack from their summer on Brokeback Mountain, an Edenie time when "nothing seemed wrong." This suggests that the present state of Ennis's world - in a drafty trailer with two shirts hanging on a nail - is quite wrong. Ennis is a man dream- ing of the past rather than the future. Although the reader is not yet aware of the sig- nificance of the two shirts (that only one of them is Ennis's, and that they are locked in a haunting embrace), the way they "shudder slightly" evokes a post-coital tremble as much as a posthumous reflex of rigor mortis. According to John Kitterman's psychoan- alytic interpretation of the shirts, "they are ghosts; they mark the return of the repressed, the piece of the real thing which sets the whole plot in motion, like an unburied body in a Greek tragedy" (56). Ultimately, the trembling shirts are just one of Proulx's uniquely phrased premonitions that love will be lost and tragedy will ensue. Proulx's opening scene in the scrappy trailer points to a number of temporal directions at once: the past, the present, and the future, Ennis's bleak, unchanging life of poverty and emotional deprivation without any further adrenaline- rush trips to schedule with Jack. An initial difference between the short story and the film is that the story involves these complex temporal loops (it begins at the "end" and is inundated</page><page sequence="6">B u £ m § &lt;N © &lt;U 60 5 řo "3 W tj •S c 3 I I g OQ Ë &lt;ê S to I (X) 1 I J ü O CQ fi O Ī f •§ 0 cu iá 1 § •3 Ä 2 Ä s II ŁO S&gt;1 3| uà á ° * i 5l 3 U •s B g 3 W ca . &lt;u -h Uh</page><page sequence="7">Andrea D. Fitzpatrick 7 with memories), while the film s trajectory is essentially more linear. It starts when the men are still teenagers (both are looking for work when they meet outside the ranch foreman s trailer) and then moves forward from there, punctuated by a few significant flashbacks. The temporal looping of Proulx's narrative is an important figure of the lover's discourse for "Brokeback Mountain" because it involves repetition, affect, and a recognizable form. When Barthes writes of the figure "ravishment," he describes a similarly looped temporality in which the impulses of memory run rampant and beginnings and ends are interwoven: "There is a deception in amorous time (this deception is called: the love story). I believe (along with everyone else) that the amorous phenomenon is an 'episode' endowed with a beginning (love at first sight) and an end (suicide, abandonment, disaffection, withdrawal, monastery, travel, etc.). Yet the initial scene during which I was ravished is merely reconstituted: it is after the fact. I reconstruct a traumatic image which I experience in the present but which I conjugate (which I speak) in the past" ( Lovers 193). Amorous time, which willingly loops back upon itself, seeking to revisit the initial scene of wonder at the first spark from the lover, is the non-place of memory in which Ennis will seemingly reside, indefinitely perhaps, because all his dreams are of the past. John Howard describes the similarity of the opening and final scenes of the story, which come together "full cir- cle," as follows: "We first meet Ennis. And he's the last man standing in the end. Alone. At the closet; his lover dead" (100). Eric Patterson observes, "By beginning and end- ing the story with what Ennis thinks and feels after Jack is gone, Proulx locates the narrative of their experience together as Ennis's memory, reinforcing the mood of nostalgia and regret" (260). The loop is a closed narrative structure that disrupts the expectation of linear time, involves a traumatic trajectory of repetition and return, and stretches temporality into a potentially never-ending continuum (Ross 96-99). At the beginning of Proulx's story, we are brought to where it will end: with an under- standing of Ennis's life without Jack as an endless half-life, a waking somnolence in its silence and solitude, uninterrupted by a new experience of love in the present. The loop is also an iconic figure that announces a rural Western regionalism. Both protagonists work with lassos: Jack in the rodeo and Ennis in livestock jobs on ranches. In the film, one also sees Jack use his lasso to flirtatiously pull Ennis into leaving Brokeback Mountain at the behest of their boss, the ranch foreman Joe Aguirre (see Figure 1). Here the loop is a relational figure because Ennis is enmeshed by Jack's desire, roped into the lover's nexus. In Lee's complexly choreographed scene, Jack throws his lasso around the taciturn, seated Ennis and tightens it, then releases it. Next, when Ennis stands up and attempts to walk down the slope, Jack lassoes Ennis's feet and pulls the rope tightly, causing Ennis to trip and fall. A wrestling match follows, where Ennis and</page><page sequence="8">8 Mosaic 43/1 (March 2010) Jack flip over one another, grasping, wriggling, and rolling in the tall grasses. The tension that builds from this rapid-fire series of physical contacts is due to the precarious shifts between heteronormative rough-housing, homoeroticism, and a potential for explosive violence. The ambivalence of the loop figure therefore suggests a gamut of conflicted responses, including desire, emotional openness, introversion, and resistance. In Proulx s story, the loop figure emerges again in dialogue during a detumescent motel scene in which Ennis and Jack re-consummate their love after a four-year hia- tus. In order to explain to Jack why he can t entertain leaving his wife and family to run, as Jack suggests, a "little ranch operation," Ennis replies morosely, "I'm stuck with what I got, caught in my own loop" (14). The loop here represents the predicament that restricts so many of Ennis s actions and life-choices: his family responsibilities, work, as well as (perhaps most acutely) the on-going, paralyzing fear of violent, homopho- bic reprisals if his and Jack's secret relationship is discovered. Thus Ennis resigns him- self to remaining in the chokehold of domestic responsibilities within an internecive, homophobic society where the potential for violence and death is real. These factors contribute to the unfulfilled direction of Ennis's life, a cycle of monotonous regularity in which he perpetually attempts to avoid the fatal equation instilled in him by his sadistic father, whereby "two guys living together" means "be[ing] dead" (14). The repetition and circularity of the loop figure ultimately represents the conun- drum of Jack and Ennis's love affair, in which, even twenty years later, nothing has moved forward or progressed. "Nothing ended, nothing begun, nothing resolved," writes Proulx to describe the fiery argument that concludes their final camping trip together (22). Both lovers exist in a perpetual state of limbo, dreaming of the past while anticipating horse-packing trips in the future - scheduled only once or twice a year - when they can be reunited. Yet, due to the rarity and brevity of their meetings, they never fully enjoy the "present" moments when they are together. As Proulx writes, "One thing never changed: the brilliant charge of their infrequent couplings was darkened by the sense of time flying, never enough time, never enough" (20). The temporality of the lover's discourse is not linear but enervated by expectation, plagued by waiting, and forever in memory's unrelenting grip. In "both A Lovers blank Discourse, (encoded) Barthes's and expressive writes (charged of "the special with longing dialectic to signify of the desire)" love letter" (157). as "both blank (encoded) and expressive (charged with longing to signify desire)" (157). What do love letters have to do with Brokeback Mountain ? For such barely literate char- acters as Ennis and Jack (neither of whom finished high school), love letters would appear contradictory, yet postal missives are sent in both texts in significant ways. I am, of course, referring to the postcards that appear in both the story and the film, where</page><page sequence="9">Andrea D. Fitzpatrick 9 they are inscriptions of desire and hope extending from one character to another. The postcards function in lieu of telephone calls to arrange their secluded mountain meet- ings; they patch the temporal and spatial gaps that keep Ennis and Jack apart for months at a time, between the states of Wyoming and Texas. Postcards are phenomenological objects par excellence because condensed within their small, flat, paper borders are the legacies of geographic distances travelled by the postcards and the hands through which they have been passed. Postcards capture the touch of the lover's hand in the penman- ship and the dried saliva under the stamp, and, in a causal relationship, signal the lover s absence (the mail object is present because the lover is away). The postcards are not a penchant of the screenwriters or those who conceived the film, but a proclivity of Annie Proulx, whose first novel is entitled Postcards. Extending across the United States over the course of a generation, Postcards tells the saga of a rural farming family, originating in Depression-era Vermont, whose unsubtle sur- name "Blood" suggests the gruesome physical traumas that befall various characters, as well as the ties that bind the family members to one another and to the land. Each chapter in the novel opens with the display of the written side of a postcard, so the handwriting, archaic typewriter fonts, rubber stamps, postage, news, and salutations take on a graphic presence. Representing postcards in a novel in such a way allows them to convey both words and images simultaneously, so that words become images in their own right. In the film Brokeback Mountain , postcards are, therefore, densely intertextual in that they refer to previous literary works by Proulx. Further, in addition to the geographic spaces through which they travel, postcards make a number of other connections: they express in words (however cryptic) Jack's and Ennis s desire to meet in order to rekindle their love; and in photographic images they illustrate the moun- tain ranges where the affair will be staged, away from the prohibitions of rural homo- phobic society (see Figures 2 and 3). As objects, the postcards in Brokeback Mountain are (rather literally) intermedia devices linking the story and the film: they materialize the translation from the printed word that defines the story's medium to the lens- based imagery that constitutes the film, as if referencing the adaptation process itself (from story to screenplay to feature film, through various hands and scripts). What is written on the postcards also reflects each protagonist's personality. Jack (whose postcard breaks the four years of silence between them) is the more loqua- cious, expressive, and driven to action of the two, although clearly not concerned with punctuation or spelling: " Friend this letter is a long time over due. Hope you get it. Heard you was in Riverton. Im coming thru on the 24th, thought Id stop by and buy you a beer. Drop me a line if you can , say if your there " (10). Ennis's hastily written response to Jack's invitation is a postcard addressed, stamped, and marked simply with " you</page><page sequence="10">0 'S 2 ôr&gt; Ü 1 D &lt;4-1 0 ŠT 4J 3 O U S 3 rt &lt;u U-. 3 0 Ph m § &lt;N © &lt;U X 00 5 ir 1 w -3 •S 'S c 3 1 IS « -a -v S oq Ē ¿ I i rt Si O ļ 'c c w 0 ■5 Ï v§ c &lt;u 1 to O O« ° Cú &lt;u n 3 n d «® hJ «Î 00 s-§ £ c ^ .3 &lt;N h3</page><page sequence="11">o; i-) i-i H-) I § 0 -3 s &lt;55 "č3 1 D o &gt;• &lt;L&gt; 3 O U S 3 ctí &lt;U PU £ u o (X! m o 0 &lt;N © &lt;u X bü 5 ir T3 &lt;u u • Ë •H -2 c s 1 ■ts « I g ŪQ Ë &lt;§ i PU 'S c w 0 1 ī Jä G v&gt; -o c« u O a, o a&gt; rs &lt;u 3 u cu co</page><page sequence="12">12 Mosaic 43/1 (March 2010) bet " (10). Ennis's re-awakened desire is necessarily hidden from his curious young wife, Alma, partly due to the fact that Jack s postcards always pass through her hands before they reach his. The postcards sent and received between Jack and Ennis are tac- tile objects that function privately in a coded language, where the men must read and write between the lines. This type of erotically charged communication between lovers is described by Barthes as follows: "Language is a skin: I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the tip of my words. My language trembles with desire" (73). In an essay on the themes of love, photography, and affect found in Barthes's work (in particular Camera Lucida, but also A Lovers Discourse ), Eduardo Cadava and Paola Cortés-Rocca observe that "lan- guage desires nothing more and nothing else than to touch the beloved's body - and the world in which it exists" (6). The postcards in Brokeback Mountain can therefore be thought to extend the reach of the characters and offer a means of making erotic, hap- tic contact, letters to caress and be caressed by the Other, tersely and secretly, without giving anything away to a third party into whose hands they might fall. In the film, the close-up shot of Ennis's fingertips making contact with Jack's words magnifies the extent to which the love letter that arrives functions as an index of both parties' desire to make more palpable, physical contact in the near future. Just as postcards can be flipped over in a physical way to show these two "sides" to the key Brokeback Mountain texts (the short story and the film), their emotional con- tent also changes radically. The first postcard Jack sends to Ennis to break the four-year silence between them is received by Ennis with quiet elation, as "the first sign of life in all that time" (Proulx, "Brokeback" 10). The sureness that the postcard invitation will be met with a response is a significant foundation of Jack and Ennis's tenuous relationship because it is through postcards, rather than any other means of communication, that they schedule their trips. Barthes also makes clear the high stakes involved in letter writing, which is predicated upon an intersubjective relationship that must be sus- tained or it risks collapse at any moment: "Like desire, the love letter waits for an answer; it implicitly enjoins the other to reply, for without a reply the other's image changes, becomes other " (158). Like any extended dialogue, the love letter awaits an answer, and this pregnant anticipation is more promising, but also potentially more disappointing, than other types of waiting. While the postcards are initially emissaries of desire, they finally deliver the cata- strophic news of Jack's death, which is as sudden as it is traumatic. When one of Ennis's postcards to Jack, sent twenty years into their relationship, is returned stamped "DECEASED," Ennis receives the news of Jack's death in a manner as silent, imper- sonal, and as unceremonious as the daily mail: a red rubber stamp bluntly made by an</page><page sequence="13">13 I S o &lt;u ii 3 O U 5 i-* 3 4&gt; PL, £ U O Uh m o 0 &lt;N © &lt;U ÖD * T3 s Si -5 •H ■2 c s 1 .2 £ g cq Ë £ 1 pu Q W C/D ā a Q -o JŹ i« 6 "O 0&gt; G 3 'S Î o 'S S E H J 2 J c1 C "55 â&gt; &lt;/&gt; C &lt;/&gt; «y T3 .a s .2 1 Í/5 .2 O -T3 B ^ £&gt;</page><page sequence="14">*13 I S &lt;4-1 o a&gt; £ «3 S 3 cö a&gt; Uh % u O Uh m o 0 &lt;N © &lt;u 00 TD &lt;u Ì •S S c a 1 j«¡ I g OQ e £ a B 773 Uh U rt 0 3 1 Ē i "§ T3 ?

Fitzpatrick 15 anonymous postal worker, without warning, buffer, or explanation (see Figure 4). Ennis's first, shocked reaction is disbelief, and then, upon learning of the horrific "acci- dent" by a telephone call made to Jack s wife Lureen in Texas, Ennis is emotionally shat- tered, as surely as was Jack's face by the fatal blows of the tire rim/ tire iron that killed him (Proulx, "Brokeback" 22). In Proulx's anti-heroic world of wounded masculinity, it is a sense of abject vulnerability that permeates, evident in the violent manner of Jacks death at the hands of murderous assailants and, subsequently, in Ennis s emo- tional state - stunned and speechless. The returned postcard bears the non-negotiable news that so brutally essentializes Jack s character to a single word consigning him to the past tense. Proulx describes the despair felt by Ennis, who is usually stoic, as expan- sive and as encompassing as the Western landscape itself: "The huge sadness of the northern plains rolled down on him" (23). In keeping with the tragic character of the story, the charming figure of the love letter transforms radically into a traumatic fig- ure, a sign that instantly discontinues the history of pleasure associated with Jack's presence (equally in Ennis s expectation of it and in its fulfillment), striking out any future possibility of romantic love for Ennis. Because there is no response to Ennis s attempted dialogue, the symbolic content of the postcards in Brokeback Mountain runs the gamut from euphoric excitement to the worst emotional suffering: the final, irre- versible severance of their protracted love affair. The failed trajectory of the postcard also embodies the loop structure (here more like a boomerang than a lasso); originating and concluding with Ennis, it does not advance. As such, the returned postcard is an allegory for Ennis and Jacks doomed relationship, a futurity that never comes to fruition. The feeling is one of desire never having realized its potential or its destination. The read devastating by Jack) does news not delivered prevent by Ennis, the returned at the postcard end of both (a deathly versions memento of Brokeback never read by Jack) does not prevent Ennis, at the end of both versions of Brokeback Mountain, from using another postcard to create a memorial to Jack. As Proulx makes clear, this postcard, purchased specifically for this purpose, depicts the snow-capped peaks of Brokeback Mountain, rather than any other mountain. When Ennis opens the trailer closet door, he takes a few moments to adjust two shirts hung by a wire hanger on a nail, buttons one of them, and then sets straight the new postcard. The image, with its mountain summit scraping such high altitudes, not only references the setting of their once-burgeoning love, but also incarnates Jack's personality: his attempts at social freedom, his optimism, and his idealism (head always in the clouds). The two old shirts are Ennis's and Jack's, blood-stained by the "playful" match of tumbling and punching, the "contortionistic grappling and wrestling" that occurred with the lasso</page><page sequence="16">16 Mosaic 43/1 (March 2010) incident twenty years earlier (Proulx, "Brokeback" 26). The shirts embody the fetishis- tic function attributed by Barthes to any piece of clothing worn by the lover during a significant amorous encounter ( Lover's 128). In the figure "habit/ habiliment," Barthes writes of the way a special garment transports the lover to a palpable connection (less an intense closeness than an impossible fusion) with the Other: "united, enclosed within the same sack of skin, the garment being merely the smooth envelope of that coalescent substance out of which my amorous Image-repertoire is made" (128). In Brokeback Mountain , the ensemble of postcard and lovingly entwined shirts creates a faceless portrait of Jack, a paltry reminder of the one whom Ennis can never again hold. Ennis's postcard no longer symbolizes a future assignation (its reverse side remains uninscribed) but, coupled with the anthropomorphic embrace of the old shirts - "the pair like two skins, one inside the other, two in one" - creates a nostalgic, memorial image (Proulx, "Brokeback" 26). With the reversal of the shirts in the film, so that Ennis s surrounds Jack's, a posthumous embrace is extended from Ennis to Jack. What is specific to the film is the ability to see the photographic side of the post- card (and the mountains splendid, heroic iconicity), and this deepens its metaphoric richness. Lee poignantly depicts this secret shrine of cowboy ephemera, whose mod- esty belies its talismanic significance, in the concluding scene of the film. In the dusty, depressing trailer whose arid atmosphere appears to be part of an intended contrast (between Ennis's current environment and the memories of Brokeback Mountain), Lee creates a composition of pictures, frames, and windows (see Figure 5). This com- position includes the film frame itself, and within it, Ennis, who stands facing the fol- lowing: a wood-panelled closet door, which is open to present the white-bordered postcard tacked above the shirts, a poignant ensemble adjacent to which there is a win- dow framing a view of a dirt road, a field of grasses, and a distant yellow horizon of crops held under a pale blue sky. Lee condenses the beautiful expansiveness fostered by the remembered, eroticized mountain landscape into a two-dimensional postcard tacked to the inside door of Ennis's closet (where his gayness, as Daniel Mendelsohn points out, will also remain). Although the postcard s cheap printing and garishly hot colours little resemble the brisk, cool meadows witnessed in the mountain scenes of the film, it alludes, nonetheless, to a wealth of sensory pleasures. Ennis's postcard-and- shirt memorial alludes to the fleeting, intangible moments previously experienced in the film involving an embodied relation to Jack (and the mountain environment where the love affair unfolded in space and time). The film, in fact, exploits the viewers' mem- ories of the sensuality offered by the lushly filmed scenes of Brokeback Mountain - its mists and frosts, sunrises and sunsets, rich jewel tones (cerulean blue, forest green, slate grey, and crimson), and panoramic landscapes, as well as the human topographies of</page><page sequence="17">Andrea D. Fitzpatrick 17 the young men's faces (skin caressed by the cameras' close-ups at every opportunity) and the sounds of their shared conversations, singing, and harmonica - by reducing them to a faded, flattened, silent postcard image. Christian Metz contrasts the struc- tural capacity of the film medium with that of photography to make a case for why personal photographs, rather than cinematic experiences, can become fetish objects (in the Freudian sense): although they involve fewer sensory dimensions, photo- graphs can - due to the fact that they are small, tangible, image-fragments - be cher- ished and preserved as intimate objects. Therefore, while the "real" mountain's dimensions of transcendence, openness, and "naturalness" functioned as the very possibility of the love affair itself, what is acutely conveyed by this final scene in the film is the loss, after Jack's death, of so many of the sensual dimensions associated with the mountain. While those sensual dimensions are inaccessible as embodied experiences, they are simultaneously transformed into and made "accessible" as pho- tographic fetish objects. However, although the photograph can indeed be held and fetishized, Barthes in Camera Lucida makes the important qualification that the pho- tograph also represents "a reality one can no longer touch" (87). Lee's final scene in the film points to the palpable human body that will remain missing from the pic- ture - Jack's - a body that was once touched by Ennis's desire. Lee's concluding cam- era gesture zooms into a close-up of the phantasmic mountain on the postcard and the top of the shirts. This focus on the memorial ensemble alludes to Jack's body by emphasizing its absence from the postcard image and from the interior of his shirt. The postcard ultimately offers only a photographic fetish to mourn Jack's death; it can only index the embodied experiences the lovers had together on the mountain. Lee's layered aesthetic (of windows and framed pictures) is not merely a virtuoso formal gesture but also a memorial image that delivers complex narrative significance. The viewer and reader mourn Jack's death and the loss of his charismatic personality as much as lament Ennis's monochromatic life without him. Ennis's choice of image - the postcard - takes him back in time to the initial, wondrous scene of amorous "ravish- ment" (to use Barthes's terminology) with Jack on Brokeback Mountain. As A Lovers Discourse makes clear, this implies a haunting temporality, loss, and a love-tainted visual memory that is inherently photographic: "Love at first sight is always spoken in the past tense: it might be called an anterior immediacy. The image is perfectly adapted to this temporal deception: distinct, abrupt, framed, it is already (again, always) a mem- ory (the nature of the photograph is not to represent but to memorialize)" (194). Lee's concluding shot of Ennis's memorial conveys the intensity of affect inherent in this memorial figure through a set of physical and emotional relationships that are shown to be simultaneously preserved and lost.</page><page sequence="18">18 Mosaic 43/1 (March 2010) The another, last figure, where the both address, image and involves language a visible are inherent body (itself in its "a meaning. figure") The speaking address to another, where both image and language are inherent in its meaning. The address is a projection that is both embodied and linguistic, words exhaled from one body to reach another. In both versions of Brokeback Mountain , Ennis 's last spoken words, "Jack, I swear - ," are addressed to the postcard-and-shirts memorial and whispered regretfully, "through a few stinging tears" (Proulx, "Brokeback" 27). These words do not engage his dead lover in dialogue as much as address him (as Ennis did with his postcards) because, like the final postcard sent to Jack, there is no answer, no further reciprocity. Jack is nonetheless invoked by Ennis's chosen words because, as Proulx writes, "Jack had never asked him to swear anything and [Ennis] was himself not the swearing kind" (27). Indeed, it is Jack, not Ennis, who peppers his talk with expletives (most often "fuckin"). Therefore, Ennis's declaration, the way he swears out of charac- ter, speaks to Jack and of Jack but not with Jack. This lack of continued reciprocity is one of the founding characteristics of the lover s discourse. The way Ennis s address breaks off, so the sentence remains incomplete, expresses the syntax of the lover s soli- tary discourse according to Barthes. Little phrases are repeated to oneself like a mantra ("a syntactical aria") to ward off the anxiety of the other's absence ( Lover's 6). As Barthes states, "Such sentences are matrices of figures precisely because they remain suspended: they utter the affect, then break off, their role is filled" (6). The suspension that characterizes the forlorn lover's syntax is also symbolic of the unrealized potential of Ennis's stuttering, fragmented relationship with Jack, Ennis's regret for lost oppor- tunities, and all the things left unsaid, especially how much he really loved Jack. As Jim Stacy argues, it is also Ennis's inability to express his love for Jack as gay that is central to the tragedy of his situation: "But, though he knows now, still he doesn't dare to speak the name: 'Jack, I swear. . .' Much of the sadness of this story lies in Ennis's unfixable loneliness and in this message undelivered, a silence that burns for the word" (215). Whether or not the address - the declaration of love - is delivered face to face is as important as the (a) symmetry of body positions in the film and the story. The way Ennis speaks to the memorial - the faceless portrait of Jack - is significant in his attempt to finally face Jack directly with an expression of his love, yet it is another sign offered too late. Recall that the last time one sees Jack's face and is made aware of Jack's per- spective in the film is the scene where, after his and Ennis's painful argument on their last camping trip together (the "I wish I knew how to quit you" scene), Jack has a wist- ful, bittersweet memory of being hugged by Ennis during one of their glory days on Brokeback Mountain. While standing in front of a campfire, Ennis wraps his arms around Jack from behind him and, while resting his head on Jack's shoulder, whispers in his ear. This endearing position, with Jack leaning back into Ennis's body, where</page><page sequence="19">Andrea D. Fitzpatrick 19 Jack felt a solid semblance of love from Ennis, initially suggests a moment of perfect harmony. Yet Proulx's qualification of Jack's daydream leaves the reader with a more nuanced understanding of the embrace and the significance of the body positions: "Later, that dozy embrace solidified in his memory as the single moment of artless, charmed happiness in their separate and difficult lives. Nothing marred it, even the knowledge that Ennis would not then embrace him face to face because he did not want to see nor feel that it was Jack he held. And maybe, he thought, they'd never got much farther than that. Let be, let be" (22). The crushing effect of Proulx's statement is that something has indeed ruptured this scene (at least for the reader, if not for Jack). Ennis does not embrace Jack face to face because he cannot admit to loving a man. The irresolvable conundrum of the love affair (which pivots around Ennis's homophobia and repression) leaves Jack meeting his violent death (just months after this daydream) never fully knowing the extent to which Ennis loves him, never hear- ing it face to face in a relationship of embodied symmetry. Only posthumously, with Ennis's declaration "Jack, I swear - ," is love expressed out loud, although it is never heard by Jack, and neither is it (figuratively speaking) to his face because the memo- rial involves a postcard of Brokeback Mountain rather than a picture of Jack. With Ennis's address, we are returned to Jack, but access to him is withheld. Ennis's speech ("Jack, I swear - ") is out of character, so the invocation of his dead lover by mirroring the Other's speech habits reflects the instability of love and the way it is imbricated with mourning. Cadava and Cortés-Rocca elaborate upon the instabil- ity of the Barthesian subject in love and how this subject's sense of autonomy, whole- ness, progress, and anticipated futurity are entirely shaken, predicated as they are upon the continued presence of the lover: "That this experience of living at the threshold of death and life is another name for the experience of love - for what takes place in our relation to the one we love - is confirmed when, in A Lovers Discoursey Barthes con- fesses: 'I have projected myself into the other with such power that when I am without the other I cannot recover myself, regain myself: I am lost, forever'" (24). The figure from A Lovers Discourse cited by Cadava and Cortés-Rocca is actually "catastrophe," which aptly describes the endless consequences of Jack's death for Ennis, the existen- tial loop or, in Barthes's phrase, a "trap from which he can never escape," the purga- tory of emptiness that consigns him to a present living in the past tense (48). Ennis has lost not only Jack to death, but also himself. One is forever transformed by love, never again the same, never autonomous, not even in solitude; ultimately one mourns the loss of the former self as much as the loved other. In describing the mourner's inability to express a stable sense of self in the wake of the death of a loved one, Judith Butler writes, "My narrative falters, as it must" (23). Butler suggests that the state of</page><page sequence="20">20 Mosaic 43/1 (March 2010) aggrieved speechlessness is an ethical paradigm founded upon the continued inter- connectivity of subjects in life and death. It is the experience not merely of being "choked up" in grief, but also of being constituted as a speaking subject by way of prior relations to loved others: "Let s face it. We re undone by each other. And if we're not, we re missing something" (23). Thus, Ennis's "Jack, I swear - " is a partial statement that manifests the failure and flaws of the lover s discourse, which is also a discourse on mourning. The relations between the two protagonists, Ennis and Jack, involve desires of the heart, journeys through memory and geographic space, interdependence, and catastrophic loss, and they suggest the transformative potential of characters, letters, and embodied relationships. The affect and visual impact of Brokeback Mountain revolves around the layering and intensification of these losses and the fact that neither the film nor the story offer the possibility of Jack s essence, the love affair, the moun- tain's freshness, or its permissive magic to ever be fully recovered. NOTES 1/ My reference to the sublime is based on Edmund Burke's notion from the eighteenth century, which suggests Romantic extremes of emotion when facing the splendour and ferocity of the natural world, which appropriately includes the peaks and valleys of mountain ranges as well as destructive weather pat- terns. 2/ The special feature issue of Film Quarterly 60.3 (2007), devoted to Brokeback Mountain, shows such crit- ical variety, evident in the essays by Chris Berry, Joshua Clover and Christopher Nealon, Kim Kitses, D.A. Miller, Ara Osterweil, B. Ruby Rich, and Robin Wood. 3/ The publication of these images is made possible by the generous financial support of the University of Ottawa's Faculty of Arts.
