<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan:  Candi Kendalisodo, Candi Yudha, and the Panji statue  from Candi Selokelir – the climax geographical situation and layout of the  sanctuaries Mount Penanggungan (1,653 m), situated approximately 50 kilometres  to the south of  Surabaya, has a peculiar shape (fig. 10.1). It has one cen- tral peak, which is surrounded by four lower summits and four more hills  on a lower level, such that it resembles a natural mandala.1 The names  of  the four upper hills, starting from the one in the northeast and then  proceeding clockwise, are Gajah Mungkur, Kemuncup, Sarahklopo, and  Bekel (fig. 10.2). Most of  the 81 sanctuaries or their remains are located  on the northern and western slopes of  the mountain.2  Many of  the sanctuaries are grouped in such a way that their loca- tions follow an ascending line on the mountain slope – for example, sites  LXI, LXII, LXIV, LXVII, and LX on the western slope, starting from  Candi Jolotundo (XXVII). Others are grouped together in close proxim- ity – for instance, sites I, XVI, LIV, LII, LIII, LI, L, and IL on the upper  western slope. Around Gajahmungkur ten sites are grouped close to each  other: VII, XX, XXI, III, XIX, IX, XXII, XVIII, VIII, and LXIX.3 As  not all the buildings are dated, we cannot conclude that these arrange- ments were the result of  a plan. However, the addition of  new sanctuar- ies may have allowed paths of  procession and groups of  sanctuaries to  develop gradually. These sanctuary groups and lines may correspond  with the so-called mandala which are mentioned in the Nagarakertagama  1 Compare my explanations on Mount Penanggungan in Chapter IV, sub-chapter ‘Water and moun- tain’. 2 I use Romondt’s (1951) numbering of  the sites in Roman numbers. 3 I visited most of  these sites during several climbs on the mountain since 1993. © Lydia Kieven, 2013  This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-  Noncommercial-NonDerivative 3.0 Unported (CC-BY-NC-ND 3.0) License. </page> <page sequence="2"> Fig. 10.1.

The building consists of  several terraces – the typical  feature in the religious architecture of  the East Javanese period – with  a central staircase. In many cases some of  the terraces are decorated  with narrative reliefs; however, at numerous sites the reliefs are no longer  extant. Often one or three altars were found on the upper terrace of  the  sanctuary, perhaps originally with a statue placed on top of  or near the  altar.5 In front of  the terraced buildings were often small shrines to be  used for offerings. It may be assumed that most of  these elements – re- liefs, altars, and shrines – originally existed at most of  the sanctuaries.  Some sites consist of  several small, ascending courtyards with altars and  terraced buildings. The terraces follow the incline of  the slope and are  oriented towards either the mountain peak or the peak of  the hill on  which they were built. I refer to them with the Indonesian term pemujaan  (place of  worship).6 The hermitages, pertapaan (place of  meditation),  consist of  a natural rock-cave or are man-made constructions.  Sanctuaries with relief  depictions of  cap-figures are:  – Candi Gajah Mungkur (XXII) – dated AD 1360  – Candi Wayang (VIII) – probably approximately AD 1360  – Candi Yudha (LX) – probably mid fifteenth century – Candi Kendalisodo (LXV) – probably mid fifteenth century – Candi Selokelir (XXIII) sculpture – dated inscription from AD 1434  I have selected Candi Kendalisodo and Candi Yudha for detailed discus- sion because they represent two different kinds of  sanctuaries (a hermit- age and a place of  worship) and also because their relief  depictions dis- play a different placement and arrangement. I investigate the sculpture  from Candi Selokelir as one of  only two known statues of  cap-figures.  The two other places are listed in the table in Chapter V, with brief  in- formation on their relief  depictions. 4 Supomo (1977, I:66-8) and Hariani Santiko (1990:163-4, 1998:240-1) discuss various names that  occur in Old Javanese literature and obviously all refer to hermitage communities: wanasrama, asrama,  patapan, kadewaguruan, mandala, and karshyan. 5 As mentioned in chapter IV, Hariani Santiko (1998:245) argues that no sculptures were placed in  the mountain sanctuaries. I, however, do not concur with this. 6 In Indonesian they are also called punden berundak. 295 </page> <page sequence="4"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs history and function of the sites Dates found in inscriptions on Mount Penanggungan range from the  late tenth century until AD 1511 (Van Romondt 1951:52). The earliest  dated site is Candi Jolotundo (AD 977), which is a holy bathing place  located on the western foot of  Mount Penanggungan.7 The majority of   the buildings are located on the upper reaches of  the mountain and date  from the fifteenth century, with the bulk dating from around the middle  of  the century. This implies that most were built and used during the  times of  conflict in Majapahit, that is, between the Civil War in 1405-06  and the attack by Muslims from Demak in 1478. Reliefs with cap-figures  only appear on buildings in the mountain’s upper reaches and date from  the middle of  the fourteenth to the middle of  the fifteenth century. Mount Penanggungan is mentioned in several ancient Javanese  texts and in oral traditions. There is evidence of  a special connection  with King Airlangga. The Calcutta-stone inscription,8 dated AD 1041,  mentions that King Airlangga went into a retreat on Pucangan. The  Nagarakertagama (Nag. 58.1, 78.1) mentions hermitages at ‘Pawitra’ and  at ‘Pucangan’. That Penanggungan/ Pawitra/ Pucangan are synonyms  for each other has been argued by several authors.9 The term pawitra in  Old Javanese, having its root in Sanskrit, means ‘purifying; pure, free  from evil, auspicious, sacred, holy’ (Zoetmulder 1982:1329). This term  refers to the sacredness which is ascribed to Mount Penanggungan due  to its peculiar shape. The Old Javanese word pucang means ‘areca-palm,  areca-nut’ (Zoetmulder 1982:1427), thus pucangan is the place of  the  areca palms. In fact ‘wild areca palms were reported to have been grow- ing on this mountain’ (Rouffaer 1909:182). The name ‘Penanggungan’  is a name that developed more recently, which can be translated from  Indonesian as ‘enduring/suffering’ or as ‘being responsible’.10 The  7 Compare my discussion of  this tirtha in Chapter IV, sub-chapter ‘Water and mountain’. 8 So called because it was brought to the Indian Museum in Calcutta by Raffles in 1813. The inscrip- tion relates facts of  King Airlangga’s life. Kern (1917:85-114) translates both sides of  the inscribed stone,  one of  which is in Sanskrit and the other in Old Javanese. These translations are also published in Kern  1885 and 1912. 9 Pigeaud 1924:215, 1960-63, IV:155, 239; Krom 1931:270; Noorduyn 1982:426. 10 I am, however, unsure about the meaning of  these words in relation to the mountain.  I am grateful to John Miksic, who provides another interesting interpretation in his comments on my  thesis (27-4-2009): ‘I am inclined to think that the name derives from the sense of  tanggung which means  to carry on one’s shoulders. This could be a reference to the four lesser peaks which appear to sit on the  shoulders of  the taller peak which symbolizes the head.’ 296 </page> <page sequence="5"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan | inscription on the Calcutta stone mentions that in AD 1041 the king  founded a hermitage at Pugawat/ Pucangan (Rouffaer 1909:180-2;  Krom 1931:259).11 According to traditional folklore, it is also believed  that at the end of  his life Airlangga himself  withdrew from worldly  affairs on Mount Penanggungan (Stutterheim 1937b:406-10; Supomo  1972:289-90). The traditional belief  found in later semi-historical babad  has it that Airlangga’s daughter lived in the hermitage on Pucangan. In  some of  the Panji stories the aunt of  Panji, Kili Suci, is a hermitess on  Pucangan.  The Nagarakertagama (Nag. 58.1) relates that King Hayam Wuruk  on his journey through the realm, coming from Candi Jawi, visited a  hermitage on the slope of  Mount Pawitra. This shows that the specific  hermitage, or even the whole mountain, was so highly venerated by the  king that he – probably accompanied by a large retinue – made the ef- fort to climb the mountain, since hermitages are usually situated on a  rather high level and are not easily accessible. Nag.78.1b mentions that  Pucangan and Pawitra belong to the seven free domains of  hermitages  (dharma lepas karshyan) under royal authority; these hermitages received  donations from the king so that poor rshi could fulfil their worshipping  and ascetic practices.  The Tantu Panggelaran, which narrates the story about the move of   Mount Meru from India to Java (Pigeaud 1924:62-6, 134-7), mentions  ‘Pawitra’ as the mountain’s top which fell down to the island of  Java  before the main part of  the mountain was set down further to the east.  Mount Penanggungan’s peculiar shape, which corresponds to the de- scription of  the mythical Indian Mount Mahameru, and which is that of   one central peak surrounded by eight summits, as well as its geographi- cal location to the west of  Mount Semeru, the highest mountain of   Java, make it clear that the ‘Pawitra’ of  the Tantu Panggelaran is Mount  Penanggungan. The Old Sundanese text Bujangga Manik from the late fifteenth or  early sixteenth century, describing the journey of  a hermit through Java,  speaks of  how the main character climbed Mount Pawitra and the sa- 11 The Sanskrit version of  the inscription has the name ‘Pugawat’ while the Old Javanese one names  it ‘Pucangan’. Rouffaer (1909:180-2) and Kern (1917:113) explain that ‘Mount Pugawat/Pucangan’ are  both synonyms for today’s Mount Penanggungan. Very recently the identification of  Pucangan with  Penanggungan has been questioned, for example by Hadi Sidomulyo  who suggests that the location of   Pucangan is near the town of  Jombang (personal communication on 24-09-2012). The issue requires  further research. 297 </page> <page sequence="6"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs cred Mount Gajah Mungkur (Noorduyn 1982:258, 414). This highlights  the importance of  the mountain even during later times and for pilgrims  from far away. All these historical and semi-historical sources reveal the  existence of  a long tradition of  ascetic practice associated with Mount  Penanggungan and its high esteem and status as a holy place.  The sites on Mount Penanggungan had different functions and  served various purposes. Most of  them were places of  worship. It has  been argued that these sites served for the worship of  the ancestors and  of  gods, particularly and predominantly for the worship of  Siwa (Hariani  Santiko 1998:246). Others served as hermitages. Several sanctuaries  combined both functions, as is evident from the layout of  some sites,  amongst them Candi Kendalisodo, and from the location of  some sites in  close proximity to each other. Further evidence is provided through the  use of  the terms karshyan/patapan/mandala as synonyms in ancient texts.  For example, the Nagarakertagama (Nag. 58.1, 68.2, 78.1, 78.7) indicates  these were groups of  buildings which served as centres of  religious edu- cation, as places to retreat from the world, and for worship of  the ances- tors and gods.12 Still other sanctuaries are holy water places, such as  the two well-known and relatively early sites Candi Jolotundo (AD 977)  and Candi Belahan (ascribed to the mid-eleventh century), and Candi  Balekambang the remains of  which bear some relief  carvings. The importance and meaning of  Mount Penanggungan must be  considered in the context of  the cult of  mountain and ancestor wor- ship as a predominant feature in the religious practice in ancient Java.  Mount Penanggungan in particular was considered as the holiest of  the  mountains, as the ‘Lord of  the Mountains’ (Supomo 1972:290). On  the slopes of  other mountains in East Java, such as Mount Arjuno or  Mount Lawu, hermitages and small sanctuaries were also built, but in  far lesser numbers than on Mount Penanggungan. In a previous chapter  I presented the long ongoing scholarly discussion about mountain and  ancestor worship in East Java.13 The major issues are the resurgence of   an ancient indigenous megalithic culture; the impact of  the advance  of  Muslim power; and the chaotic and unstable political situation in  fifteenth-c entury Majapahit, which led to an increased tendency to  practise asceticism at remote sites. As mentioned before, the ‘resurgence  12 Compare Agus A. Munandar (1990b:195-259); Hariani Santiko 1998. See also Chapter IV, sub- chapters ‘Unity of  the realm’ and ‘Decline of  Majapahit’. 13 Chapter IV, sub-chapters ‘Decline of  Majapahit’ and ‘Water and mountain’. 298 </page> <page sequence="7"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan | of  a megalithic tradition’ has been questioned in recent years, and I  do indeed not consider this tradition to be a determining factor for the  increase of  mountain sanctuaries. The issue of  an interconnection be- tween the political instability and ascetic practice, however, is of  particu- lar importance and relevance for my object of  research. The principals, or donors, for the foundations of  the sanctuaries  were members of  the wealthy or aristocratic society of  Majapahit. This  is suggested by the mention of  ‘Pucangan‘ and ‘Pawitra’ as free domains  under royal authority in the Nagarakertagama (Nag. 78.1b). By commis- sioning architects and artists, these principals manifested their claim to  be part of  constituting the political order. Reality, with competitions in  the aristocratic hierarchy during the time of  political upheaval of  the  fifteenth century, was mirrored in fiction, with the struggle of  Panji in  the Panji stories.14 The frequent depictions of  Panji stories in reliefs on  Mount Penanggungan, and the Panji sculpture from the middle of  the  fifteenth century from Candi Selokelir, should be considered against this  background. The tradition of  hermits living in remote areas had increased in the  late Majapahit period, and their status had risen as well. Most likely, pil- grims from all parts of  society, in particular members of  the aristocracy  and even kings, retreated to hermitages in seek of  spiritual knowledge  and power. The remoteness of  the mountain from the world, from the  noise and distractions of  daily life, attracted pilgrims who sought the  silence for inspiration and to reach an understanding of  religious knowl- edge.  This remoteness corresponds to the secrecy of  the esoteric Tantric  knowledge, which lies beyond the basic religious and ritual practice. The  more remote or higher up on the mountain, the deeper or higher you  can progress towards attaining the secret Tantric knowledge. The beauty  of  the site, with its nature, forest, ravines, and spectacular views was re- garded and perceived as full of  awesome magic and spirits. This beauty  contributed to the arousal of  langö, which is a yantra for the unification  with the Divine. The mountain thus became a yantra itself  in achieving  this union. After having reached, on the upper slopes of  the mountain,  the union with the Divine, in the understanding of  the Tantric doctrine,  the pilgrim would descend and take a bath in Jolotundo to unify with the  14 See Chapter II, sub-chapter ‘Panji stories’. Compare Hunter 2007. 299 </page> <page sequence="8"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs ishtadewata. This is the process of  the Tantric Kundalini path: the ascent  to the Sahasrara, followed by the descent to the Anandakanda-padma.15 The community of  others searching for the same goal was certainly  supportive of  these religious seekers. The effort of  climbing the moun- tain to reach the sanctuaries, however, means it is unlikely there were  masses of  people in this group, but rather that it was an exclusive com- munity of  worshippers and pilgrims.16 Water is a very important theme in the mythology of  Mount  Penanggungan and its sanctuaries. As elaborated in Chapter IV,  w ater has a twofold symbolism depending on its function as amerta or  tirtha. Following the Samudramanthana story in the version of  the Tantu  Panggelaran, Mount Penanggungan itself, as the top of  Mount Meru,  produces the amerta through the churning of  the ocean. The tirtha, such  as Candi Jolotundo, on the lower slopes of  the mountain served for ritu- ally purifying the pilgrims and, thus, for preparing them on their path  to a higher stage of  esoteric knowledge before they climbed the moun- tain. Earlier in this book I explained the symbolic identity of  amerta and  the semen of  Siwa, which finds its manifestation in the lingga sculpture  of  Jolotundo, this sculpture mimicking Mount Penanggungan itself.  Jolotundo comprises both meanings of tirtha and amerta: the water sources  along the slopes of  the mountain – manifestations of  amerta – also have  served for recurrent purification and preparation of  the pilgrims in the  sense of  tirtha. In a very practical way, water was necessary for the supply of  the  hermits and pilgrims with drinking water; during the rainy season, water  was provided by brooks and water sources. We do not know how the  situation was in the dry season, when water was scarce. There must have  been people who provided the hermits and the pilgrims with food and  water, and they certainly gained merit through these deeds. Still today, some of  the sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan are  visited by the local people, who bring offerings or meditate there. Candi  Jolotundo is particularly respected; pilgrims come to take a ritual bath  15 See Chapter IV, sub-chapter ‘Tantrism’. 16 I am grateful to John Miksic for his comment (27-4-2000) on the number of  pilgrims visiting  P enanggungan: ‘This mountain is not particularly high. It is only about a thousand metres to the moun- tain’s shoulder where the majority of  the shrines are located. Jolotundo is located at 500 metres, from  there it is only another 500 metres to the shoulder zone.’ Furthermore, Majapahit’s capital Trowulan,  with its population of  ‘at least 100,000 at its peak’, and located only about 30 km from Penanggungan,  would have provided a large number of  pilgrims.  300 </page> <page sequence="9"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan | Fig. 10.3.

On the other hand, in the course of   time many sanctuaries or parts of  them have been damaged or destroyed,  and many reliefs stolen. During my visits to Mount Penanggungan since  1993, I was sad to find again and again that parts of  the sites had been  damaged or had disappeared, perhaps having found their way into the  international art market so that they now in private hands.  candi kendalisodo This site – no. LXV – is located on the northern slope of  Gunung  Bekel, the northwestern hill below the peak of  Mount Penanggungan,  at a height of  about 1100 metres. Access to the place requires a long,  steep walk of  three to four hours. The sanctuary consists of  two parts, a  terraced construction and a natural rock-cave which is closed by a man- made split gate (fig. 10.3). Both parts are decorated with narrative reliefs.  All three reliefs on the gate walls have been stolen, and three of  the four  panels on the terraced structure have been damaged, but luckily photos  301 </page> <page sequence="10"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs of  them have been preserved by the Dutch Archaeological Service. In  addition, I was able to take some photographs in situ myself.17  Candi Kendalisodo served both as a pemujaan and as a pertapaan.  There are no inscriptions or dates. Stutterheim (1940:132) dates the site  to the middle of  the fifteenth century, as most of  the sanctuaries on the  upper level of  Mount Penanggungan are from that time. I agree with this  date, as this dating is supported by the style of  the reliefs. In the follow- ing discussion of  the site, I will refer to my earlier article (Kieven 2000);  however, at some points in this chapter I will suggest new interpretations,  which I have developed since then. Candi Kendalisodo has the highest position in a group of  five sites  (LXI-LXV). The other four sites are scarcely visible. Inscriptions were  found at site LXI, dated AD 1414, and at site LXIII, dated AD 1404.  An inscription from site LXIV was read as AD 1410 or 1451. Site LXIII  was a simple hermitage, and at LXIV the image of  a dwarapala was  found (Van Romondt 1951:36-7). These sites probably formed a mandala  group of  both pemujaan and pertapaan. Due to the fact that it occupies  the geographically highest position and is the largest in size within this   mandala, Candi Kendalisodo may have been the central and most impor- tant place in this mandala.18 Visitors enter the small plateau, which opens  to a spectacular view over the northern plains of  the Brantas delta. The  pemujaan is situated at the south side of  the plateau, and the pertapaan at  the east side.  The pemujaan consists of  three terraces with a central staircase. The  two lower terraces are decorated with four large relief  panels which must  be read starting on the first terrace from left to right (panels 1 and 2);  on the second terrace from right to left (panels 3 and 4).19 They feature  a noble couple, the male wearing a cap as headgear. Due to weathering  the carving of  the cap is less clear in some panels, while a sharp-edged  cap is visible only in panel 3. The lady, her long hair loose, has the typi- cal features of  a young noblewoman. Another couple is comprised of  a  17 The relief  depicting Bhima and the one depicting the temptation scene of  Arjuna were stolen  around 1992; the relief  depicting the bathing widadari was stolen around 1997 (information by Pak   Paedan, the juru kunci of  Kendalisodo and of  other Penanggungan sanctuaries, on 16-6-2010). 18 As mentioned in Chapter IV in my discussion of  mountain sanctuaries, Supomo (1977:67-8), Agus  A. Munandar (1990b:202-3), and Hariani Santiko (1988:240-1) point to the existence of  such hierarchies  within a kadewaguruan/mandala. 19 Two of  the panels have been damaged since 1996; very sadly, the upper parts of  the body, including  the cap of  Panji, have been cut out. Luckily I took photos of  the complete panels in 1996. 302 </page> <page sequence="11"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan | maid servant with the typical hair bun, and a small, dwarf-like panakawan.  Obviously the maid servant is the companion of  the noblewoman and  the panakawan the companion of  the nobleman. The cap-figure has been  interpreted as Panji (Holt 1967:89; Terwen-de Loos 1971; Kieven 2000).  In my earlier article (Kieven 2000), I identify the narrative with the  Jayakusuma story. This story was very popular in the nineteenth century  in Surakarta; however, no earlier written versions are known.20 It speaks  of  Panji and his betrothed Candrakirana who, before getting married,  are ordered by his parents to visit his grandparents who live on the is- land of  Borneo and pay homage to them. While they are crossing the  ocean by boat, a storm separates them and brings him to Borneo and  her to Bali. Only later, after many adventures, do they meet again.21 I  am less certain now that I interpreted this narrative correctly. However,  the t opics of  crossing of  the ocean and the subsequent separation of  the  two protagonists, both of  these topics constituting crucial elements in the  Jayakusuma story, are also to be found in several other Panji stories. Thus,  maybe another unknown version served as the source material for the  depiction at Kendalisodo.22  The first panel (fig. 10.4) depicts the two couples within a compound  consisting of  several buildings and enclosed by a wall, which suggests  an aristocratic ambience. In the main building two people are pictured  sleeping. The two aforementioned couples kneel while making the ges- ture of  sembah towards the sleeping persons, which means they are taking  leave. Obviously this happens in the night or the early morning, a time  when Javanese people still today set out on a journey to avoid the heat of   the day. The second panel (fig. 10.5) shows the same two couples walk- ing in a beautiful landscape marked by rocks, trees, and a flagstone path  winding through the mountains. The panakawan carries a vina, a stringed  20 Poerbatjaraka (1940a:103) discusses the story, same as Padmapuspita (n.y.). A summary of  the plot  is also provided in Sulastrin Sutrisno et al. 1983:37. Coster-Wijsman (1952) discusses a textile with depic- tions of  the story in wayang style, kept in the Royal Tropical Institute in Amsterdam. 21 Terwen-de Loos (1971) gives another interpretation of  the reliefs, which is based on the life story  of  Raden Wijaya, the founder of  Majapahit, as told in the Kidung Harsa Wijaya. On many points this  interpretation is not at all convincing to me. According to Terwen-de Loos, the episode in the reliefs  depicts the part of  the story after Raden Wijaya has fought against the Kediri attack, this fight forming  an important part of  the story. If  it were so, then in my opinion some reference to the fight would be  illustrated in the reliefs. Beyond this, Terwen-de Loos mixes up the relief  panels. Thus, I cannot follow  her interpretation. 22 Another interesting point related to my interpretation is Soekmono’s (1995:102) note, referring to  Van Hoëvell (1851, II:111), that in ‘popular lore, Jolotundo was a tomb prepared for the Jenggala king  Panji Joyokusumo’. 303 </page> <page sequence="12"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs Fig. 10.4.

It is the only known depiction of  this instrument in  ancient Javanese art, especially in this relatively late phase of  Indian influence in Java. It perhaps reflects  an increased contact with Indian traders at that time. Kunst (1968:20) explains this instrument has  similarities with the North-Indian bin and the South-Indian vina. I was lucky to be given the opportunity  by Ernst Heins, ethnomusicologist in Amsterdam, to examine the original correspondence between Jaap  Kunst and Willem Stutterheim in 1936 on this subject. A translation of  a few passages from the Dutch  says: Stutterheim (10-1-1936): ‘[...] one of  the newly found reliefs of  the Penanggungan on which a  beautiful and clear rendering of  a zither with two gourds.

[...] In the reliefs of  the Bayon such double gourd bins are  also shown.’ [I am grateful for the translation by J.

A separation is not explicitly shown, but if  indeed  the Jayakusuma or a story with a similar plot is depicted then the scene  in the last panel and Panji‘s gesture towards the sea indirectly suggests  the upcoming separation: when crossing the ocean the two lovers will be  separated, while the original purpose is to pay homage to his grandpar- ents on another island across the ocean. However, perhaps it is merely  the theme of  crossing the water which is given priority without any refer- ence to what might actually happen.  The fact that the major elements of  Panji stories are extant, and that  the nobleman wears the cap, allows us to conclude that the depiction of  a  Panji story was in fact intended. Furthermore it has to be considered that  the reliefs at Candi Kendalisodo, due to its rather late date of  construc- tion within the Majapahit period, stood in a long tradition of  depictions  306 </page> <page sequence="15"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan | of  Panji stories, so that the presentation of  but a few selected features  was sufficient enough for visitors to identify these reliefs as a Panji story. As discussed earlier (Kieven 2000), the whole sequence may symboli- cally suggest the journey which visitors to this sanctuary had undertaken  themselves. They also had left their family, probably in the night or very  early morning; they had walked through a beautiful landscape with  rocks, ravines, and woods, following a steep path on the mountain slope;  they certainly took a rest, if  possible at a water site at the lower slope of   the mountain. They did all this in order to pay homage to the ancestors,  which is one of  the purposes of  visiting this sacred site on the mountain.  The second purpose is to seek advice and listen to the teaching of  a  hermit, suggested by Panji’s hand indicating the direction towards the  pertapaan.  I want to call particular attention to the motif  of  water in both the  third and fourth panel. The depiction of  the lake with waterspouts in the  third panel recalls the holy water places Candi Jolotundo (on the west  side), Candi Belahan (on the east side), and Candi Balekambang (on the  north side) on the lower levels of  Mount Penanggungan. There most  likely existed other tirtha places in former times. Thus, from wherever  the pilgrims began their ascent to Candi Kendalisodo, they would cer- tainly pass by a water place. This is taken up in the relief  depiction, thus  supporting my impression that the visitors are directly addressed in the  illustrations so they can identify themselves with the depicted persons.  The relief  thus visualizes the symbolic meaning of  the Bathing Places  on Mount Penanggungan: purification and preparing for the passage to  Higher Knowledge. The depiction of  the ocean in the fourth panel indi- cates the crossing of  water in order to proceed to the spiritual teaching  which is then conducted in the hermitage. In a certain way, the theme of  the final episode of  the Panji story  is carried on in the relief  depictions on the pertapaan. The three panels  depict two scenes from the Arjunawiwaha and one from the Bhimasuci  story.26 Two panels feature scenes in which water is predominant. To the  left of  the gate a panel depicted the widadari bathing in water, and to the  right of  the gate there was the popular scene in which two widadari try  26 None of  these three original panels is still extant today, the panel with the bathing widadari only  having been stolen in recent years. 307 </page> <page sequence="16"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs Fig. 10.8. Candi Kendalisodo, pertapaan, Bhima relief   (courtesy of  Kern Institute, Leiden University, OD nr. 12634) to seduce the meditating Arjuna.27 The upper left panel depicted Bhima  entering the ocean, the crucial moment in the Bhimasuci story before he  meets Dewaruci on the bottom of  the ocean (fig. 10.8); there he is taught  how to find the Supreme Knowledge and the amerta.28 Bhima‘s headgear  is a supit urang.  My interpretation of  the site runs as follows: Candi Kendalisodo as a  whole is a mirror of  the gradual approach of  the worshipper to the final  encounter with the Divine. In this scenario, the Panji story and particu- larly Panji with Candrakirana function as companions and guides for  the pilgrim, owing to the popularity of  this story and its connection to  daily life. In the pemujaan the worshippers first pay homage to the ances- tors and proceed symbolically towards the mountain top. Along the way  the depicted union of  Panji and Candrakirana – in the romantic scene  symbolizing the sexual intercourse – is another part of  the preparation  of  the adept, suggesting the final union with the Divine according to the  Tantric concept. The adept is then, with the depiction of  the last panel,  directed to go down to the water, which he/she finds back at the hermit- 27 Other examples can be found at Candi Surowono, Candi Kedaton, and in a single stone from  Kediri (compare Kieven 1994). 28 See Chapter IV, sub-chapter ‘Water and mountain’.  308 </page> <page sequence="17"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan | age. There he/she can seek teaching from a living hermit. The reliefs on  the hermitage walls demonstrate for the adept what he/she is supposed  to do: first to clean him/herself, as depicted in the scene of  the widadari  bathing in the lake which symbolizes purification through passing tirtha.  In a second step the adept would meditate and control the senses as does  Arjuna. In a third step he/she would enter the water, as does Bhima. In  this final step he/she will proceed to the Highest Knowledge – by the  spiritual passage through tirtha, and eventually followed by achieving  amerta. The hermit will give the appropriate advice in this process.   What I have just explained corresponds to the Tantric Kundalini  path. Kendalisodo represents a quasi-concise form of  this path, which we  find in a more extended way in Candi Panataran. The adept follows the  movement of  the Kundalini in the body upwards to the Sahasrara-cakra,  which accords the ascent to the top of  the pemujaan. Then the adept goes  down to the Anandakanda-padma, symbolized in the pertapaan in two depic- tions of  water: the widadari scene and the final scene of  Bhima entering  the ocean. The temptation scene of  the Arjunawiwaha, showing both  erotic and ascetic qualities, displays the quintessence of  this process.29 We have seen that the illustration of  water at Candi Kendalisodo is  a predominant feature: in two panels of  the Panji story on the pemujaan,  and in two panels on the pertapaan water plays a dominant role. As men- tioned, the depictions of  water here symbolize both amerta and tirtha in  the respective panels. Furthermore, at this specific place on the slope  of  Mount Penanggungan water is an important topic per se, since it is a  symbol of  the amerta which emerges from Mount Meru.  Another form of  symbolism on the political level is the struggle of   young royals within the political hierarchy. As mentioned before, the  increasing number of  sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan during the  fifteenth century may reflect the political instability of  this late phase of   Majapahit, when many members of  the aristocracy sought advice of   hermits or even withdrew from daily life to remote areas on mountains.  The story of  Prince Panji, who struggles to become an accomplished  kshatriya, was a model for these royals. In identifying with him, they were  here at Candi Kendalisodo introduced to the encounter with the hermit  in the pertapaan. The frequent depictions of  Panji in other sanctuaries on  Mount Penanggungan confirm the important role attributed to Panji. 29 Compare the discussion of  the Arjunawiwaha depiction at Candi Surowono. 309 </page> <page sequence="18"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs In comparing the pemujaan with the pertapaan we find the typical di- chotomy in the layout of  a temple: that between the mundane world and  the sacred world, respectively. This dichotomy is expressed in the style  and the way the male protagonists of  the stories are depicted. The Panji  story has the typical features of  the ‘post-mythological stories’, while  Arjuna and Bhima belong to the ‘mythological stories’ which are based  on the Indian epics. As in other sites, the Panji story prepares and intro- duces the visitor to the sacred sphere. Panji acts again as an intermediary. Candi Kendalisodo maintained the highest place in the spiritual  hierarchy within a mandala group. It makes sense that this highest place  was decorated with reliefs illustrating the approach to the highest level  of  esoteric knowledge. The high aesthetic quality of  the reliefs, with  the beautiful images on the stone walls, and the beautiful scenery of   the place itself  formed part of  this approach. The aesthetic attraction  of  hermitages was a common feature in Old Javanese poetry (Supomo  1977:68). The Nagarakertagama (Nag. 32) reports on the forest hermitage  of  Sagara, which was visited by the king. The poet describes the beauti- ful scenery in detail, as well as the stone carvings on the walls. Langö  is the means to achieve the goal of  the final union with the deity and  the liberation ‘from the snares in which the world keeps man trapped’  (Zoetmulder 1974:185). This can easily be transferred to the situation of   the retreating seekers of  truth on the mountain sanctuaries, remote from  the world, who would experience langö by watching the reliefs and enjoy- ing the beautiful scenery.30  candi yudha Candi Yudha – no. LX – is located on the northwestern saddle between  the Bekel Hill and the body of  Mount Penanggungan at a height of   about 1,000 metres. This sanctuary is of  the pemujaan type, with four ter- races and a central staircase. It is dated to the year AD 1486. During the  time of  Van Romondt (1951) the relief  decorations were still in situ, and  there was a small shrine in front of  the temple. When I visited the place  in 1996, all reliefs and the shrine had gone. However, photos by the OD  30 Patt (1982) has elaborated on the natural beauty of  the scenery of  many sites. She reasons that the  choice of  such places to erect a sanctuary was in fact deliberate. 310 </page> <page sequence="19"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan | Fig. 10.9. Candi Yudha  (courtesy of  Kern Institute, Leiden University, OD nr. 12052) from the early twentieth century provide us with excellent images of  the  site and the reliefs. Candi Yudha (fig. 10.9) is part of  a group of  three sanctuaries,  the others being the sites LXVI (Candi Naga II) and LXVII (Candi  Pandawa); all three are terraced sanctuaries.31 There are several ways to  access Candi Yudha, but one would always start at Candi Jolotundo and  follow a long line of  sanctuaries on the western slope of  the mountain  to a certain point beyond Candi Sinta (no. XVII), where you would turn  onto a sidetrack leading to the three sites. All three places offer beautiful  views of  the mountain peak and, through the saddle between the hills of   Bekel and Gajah Mungkur, towards the plain of  the Brantas River and  the ocean, which is visible on clear days.  The temple is decorated with four long relief  panels on the two lower  terraces.32 One reads the reliefs, starting on the first terrace, from the  right to the left panel, and on the second terrace, from the left to the  right panel.  The two lower long panels depict scenes from the Arjunawiwaha (figs.  10.10 and 10.11). The right panel has the scene where God Indra sends  out the heavenly nymphs to seduce Arjuna. One of  the widadari has  31 Candi Pandawa, AD 1511, is the most recent of  all Penanggungan sanctuaries. The relief  panels  at this site, today no longer extant, illustrated scenes, presumably from the Mahabharata (Van Romondt  1951:41-3). 32 In my descriptions I will use the present tense, although the place is very much damaged today. 311 </page> <page sequence="20"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs Fig. 10.10.

Candi Yudha, first terrace, left side of  the staircase (courtesy of  Kern Institute, Leiden University, OD  nr. 12057, cropped from the original) adopted an erotic posture, anticipating the encounter with Arjuna. The  left lower panel depicts the scene of  the seven widadari preparing for  Arjuna’s seduction, six of  whom bathe while Suprabha watches them.  The six bathing nymphs are all in erotic postures. Both are important  scenes in the Arjunawiwaha story. They display similarities, concerning the  depiction’s composition and iconography, to the corresponding scenes  depicted in Candi Surowono.33 In both scenes Suprabha, who plays a  principal role in the story as the most beloved by Arjuna, is depicted with  a crown; this distinguishes her from the other nymphs, who have a simple  hairdress. The second panel displays the six nymphs next to Suprabha  in very erotic positions. 33 Compare Worsley 1986: scene 15, scene 14. 312 </page> <page sequence="21"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan | The two long panels on the second terrace illustrate scenes from the  Ramayana. On the left side of  the staircase Rama teaches Wibhisana, the  brother of  the demon king, the asta brata, the eight rules for a righteous  king. They are accompanied by Lakshmana, the monkey king Sugriwa,  his general Hanuman, and Anggada. On the right panel the demon king,  Rahwana, orders the waking up of  his other brother, Kumbhakarna.  On either side next to the staircase, the left pillar portrays Sugriwa  with Hanuman standing behind him, while the right pillar depicts  Kumbhakarna who faces the threat of  the two monkeys. The third ter- race has no long relief  panels, but the pillars next to the staircase are  again decorated with figures of  the Ramayana story: on the left-hand side,  Sugriwa with Hanuman, the latter on his way to fly across the ocean  to Lengka (fig. 10.12); on the right-hand side, Rahwana, who faces the  monkeys.34 Thus in the depictions on the two upper terraces there is a  division between the left side featuring Rama with his followers and the  right side featuring the demons.  Each of  the two panels on the first terrace are framed to the right and  left by a standing figure in noble attire. These figures face the respective  panel and hold one arm up. On the right side of  the staircase they both  point to the left, which is to say the outer figure indicates towards the  panel, and the left figure indicates towards the staircase and at the same  time towards the following panel. The two figures framing the second  panel both point to the panel itself. In both cases the figures seem to  invite the viewer to take a look at the episodes in the panels. The figures  at the inner sides next to the staircase have a sharp-edged crescent-moon  shaped cap, while the headgear of  the outer figures is a kind of  wig with  curls of  hair shaped in the form of  a cap. Such a headgear is known from  the depiction in the Gambyok relief  (c. AD 1400) where this wig figure  acts as a companion of  Panji; he is a specific kind of  kadeyan, an arya or  rangga of  the same noble status as Panji.35 This character seems to have  become popular during the late Majapahit period.  I interpret these reliefs as follows: the figure with the sharp-edged cap  is Panji or else symbolizes a young royal person who has the same status  as Panji. He and his companion welcome the visitors and present them- selves as introducers and intermediaries between the mundane world  34 The Ramayana reliefs have been described and interpreted by Stutterheim (1938:29), but he does not  describe the relief  panels of  the lower terrace. See also Van Romondt 1951:35. 35 See Chapter III, sub-chapter ‘Kadeyan’. 313 </page> <page sequence="22"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs Fig. 10.12. Candi Yudha, panel on the third terrace,  depicting Sugriwa and Hanuman.  (courtesy of  Kern Institute, Leiden University, OD nr. 12061) from which the worshippers come and the sacred world which they are  entering. The first step into the sacred world is illustrated by the dispatch  of  the widadari by God Indra, and by their preparation and purification  in water as depicted on the lower level. Panji and his companion point  to this preparation. Both scenes are highly erotic and suggest, in an in- direct way, the union of  male and female, the goal of  the Tantric path.  Although not illustrated here, it is known from the Arjunawiwaha story  that Arjuna could only consummate his marriage with the widadari after  some struggles: several trials during his meditation, including the tempta- tion by the widadari, and, finally, the successful fight against the demon  Niwatakawaca.36  The upper levels contain scenes from the Ramayana presenting the  preparation for the fight between Rama’s army, under the leadership of   Hanuman, and the demons. The ambiguity between loyalty to Rahwana  and resistance against him is thematized in the two differing charac- ters of  Rahwana’s brothers, Wibhisana and Kumbhakarna. The ideal  kingship is then symbolized as the solution to this ambiguity in Rama’s  teaching of  the asta brata towards Wibhisana. The emphasis placed on  Hanuman, who is featured in three scenes, refers to his particular role  in the late Majapahit time, when his mystical qualities were highlighted  36 Compare the discussion in Chapter VIII (Candi Surowono) on the Tantric character of  the Arju- nawiwaha. 314 </page> <page sequence="23"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan | and he was upgraded to the status of  a semi-deity.37 The upper terraces  of  the temple present a parallel to the task that is waiting for Arjuna  to be fulfilled: his fight against the demon Niwatakawaca. Thus the  Ramayana scenes are a continuation of  the Arjunawiwaha scenes. After  the successful fight – Rama and Hanuman against Rahwana, or Arjuna  against Niwatakawaca – the hero can proceed to be fully recognized as a  kshatriya, thus meeting all conditions to become a king. The selection of   the specific scenes places the focus on the aspects of  eroticism, prepara- tion for the practice of  asceticism, and ideal kingship. The actions of   Arjuna and Rama are also preparations to eventually become reunited  with Suprabha and Sita, respectively.  This mythological process parallels the preparation of  a young royal  to ascend in the hierarchy: by being introduced to the Tantric doctrine,  by being confronted with the fight against opponents, and by being  taught the ideals of  a righteous king, he would finally fulfil the precondi- tions to become an accomplished kshatriya. On the esoteric level, through the erotic situations on the lower level  of  the sanctuary, the visitor is attuned to the Tantric path, and he/she  must go along this path via many struggles in order to reach the union  with the Divine. As the Tantric teaching was highly secret, it makes  sense that only the preparations to the Tantric goal were depicted in the  reliefs and that the final goal, the union of  Siwa with Sakti – which in  the two stories is symbolized in the union of  Arjuna with the widadari or  by Rama with Sita – was left to the mere imagination of  the worshipper.  It is highly probable that there was a spiritual teacher who provided the  complete explanations so the adherent would understand. We may imag- ine that the final teaching was sought for in a hermitage in the vicinity of,  or further up on, the mountain. It is remarkable that here in Candi Yudha both terraces have depic- tions of  a kakawin based on the Indian Mahabharata, as usually kakawin are  only displayed in the upper terraces of  a temple. The Panji and kadeyan  figures only appear on the lowest terrace, which accords to their usual  placement within a temple. The fact that they are depicted outside of  the  actual narrative illustrations, and that they are taller than the protago- nists in the panels, allows them to appear on the same level as the wor- shippers. This is comparable to the depictions of  standing figures in the  37 In the final panel on the upper terrace, he is ready to fly to Lengka to encounter Rahwana, who is  facing him. Compare Kieven 2011, and Chapter VII on Candi Panataran.  315 </page> <page sequence="24"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs Inner Bathing Place at Candi Panataran and at the entrance of  Candi  Mirigambar. They are themselves not involved in any narrative, but,  rather, only act as companions and guides. In this way their function as  introducers/intermediaries to the sacred world becomes clear. The four  figures in Candi Yudha point with their hands to the respective panel or  to the following panel. Panji himself  is depicted next to the staircase, such  that he is closer to the next step to the upper terraces symbolizing the  more sacred sphere, while the kadeyan figure occupies the outside posi- tion with a stronger connection to the mundane sphere. The water in the  bathing scene of  the widadari has the purifying function of  tirtha, just as  it does in the scene on the hermitage wall of  Candi Kendalisodo. Thus  the pilgrim is purified and prepared for the encounter with the sacred  sphere before going further in this visit of  the pemujaan. The placement  of  the four figures on the corners has the same function as those at Candi  Panataran, Candi Surowono, and Candi Mirigambar, where the scenes  on the corners function to introduce the pilgrims to the temple’s impor- tant message. The corners thus have the same function as elsewhere the  lower or entrance part of  a temple has. None of  the three sanctuaries – Naga II, Pandawa, Yudha – forming  one mandala group, shows signs of  having a hermitage. They are all ter- raced sanctuaries (pemujaan) for worship, with no recognizable hierarchy  in their respective location or in architecture or decoration. We can  imagine that the pilgrims on their way to hermitages on the mountain  visited these pemujaan; these visits served as a preparation for their en- counter with the religious teaching in the hermitages. The Yudha reliefs  constitute a visualization and thus a symbol of  this preparation.38 the panji statue from candi selokelir This statue (fig. 10.13a) is one of  the only two known three-dimensional  images depicting a nobleman with a cap. The Selokelir sculpture from  the middle of  the fifteenth century represents the climax in the develop- ment of  the Panji cult in the Majapahit period. A few features typical  of  the depiction of  a deity characterize this Panji figure as an object  of  worship in a way similar to the worship of  a deity, however, without  38 The depictions on Candi Pandawa may have had the same function. 316 </page> <page sequence="25"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan | Fig. 10.13a.

This is comparable to the ascent of   other heroes, such as Bhima and Hanuman, to a semi-divine status in the  same time period. Based on the well-established role of  Panji as an inter- mediary, this Panji image incorporated the same function of  introducing  pilgrims to the sacred world and to esoteric teaching. Displaying both  human and divine features, Panji had developed to be the ideal character  to act as this intermediary. 317 </page> <page sequence="26"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs The ruins of  Candi Selokelir are located on the southwestern slope  of  the hill Sarahklopo, which is the southwestern of  the eight hills  surrounding the peak of  Mount Penanggungan. In 1900 the site was  visited, and later documented, by the Dutch official Broekveldt (1904).  The local people in those times called the site Watoe Kelir.39 Broekveldt  mentions the ruins of  two terraced sanctuaries and of  another building.  He describes the place as having an extraordinarily beautiful view. This  gave Rouffaer (1909:182) the idea that this site was perhaps identical  with the hermitage of  Panji’s legendary aunt Kili Suci. Krom (O.V.  1915:2) describes six monuments which originally stood on the plateau  of  this site. After a recent meticulous restoration, undertaken by the  Archaeological Service, the typical terraced structure of  a pemujaan, hav- ing one central staircase, is now clearly recognizable.40 Candi Selokelir  was originally decorated with narrative reliefs. Duijker (2010:173, figs.  61, 167) describes a relief  which was photographed by Claire Holt in  1933, depicting a scene featuring Bhima. During my visits of  the site in  2000 and 2011, I could still detect a few fragments of  narrative reliefs,  without however being able to identify any. From some remains, such as  parts of  depicted legs, I could recognize the typical style of  depictions of   ‘post-mythologial stories’.41 Stutterheim (1936b) reports the discovery of  two parts of  a sculpture.  Initially, the body was found and thought to be the part of  a female  image, due to the soft forms of  the body. Sometime later the head was  discovered, and Stutterheim recognized the completed statue as being  similar to the image of  the Grogol statue.42 The characteristic element  for identifying the Selokelir statue as Panji was the cap. Stutterheim  (1936b:335) dates the figure to the middle of  the fifteenth century, refer- 39 Watu (Indonesian) or selo (Javanese) means ‘stone’. Kelir (screen) refers to the screen in the wayang  performance. Thus Watukelir/Selokelir can be translated as ‘screen of  stone’. The name refers to the  stone basement, carved with some reliefs, which was compared to a wayang screen. 40 During my visit to Candi Selokelir in the year 2000 only a few parts of  the terraced construction of   the main site were extant. In 2011 I was happy to see the well-reconstructed site. No remains seem to be  left of  the other five monuments mentioned by Krom. 41 Same as in other remote sites, a large number of  relief  fragments have vanished in the course of  the  last years. Many stones have just been heaped up, ignoring any of  the discernible connections between  some relief  fragments. Several fragments of  narrative reliefs originating from the site are kept in the  Museum Majapahit in Trowulan; they display the style  reminiscent of  that of  Panji reliefs. 42 See Chapter III, sub-chapter ‘Kadeyan’ 318 </page> <page sequence="27"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan | ring to some dated stones from the Selokelir site (AD 1434)43 and to the  Grogol statue of  AD 1413.  The Panji sculpture is now kept in Bandung in the arts library of   the University ITB (Institut Teknologi Bandung). The statue, 150 cen- timetres high, depicts a body, standing on a lotus cushion, with a long  kain, bare chest, and the left arm hanging straight; the right arm, partly  broken, holds a lotus bud in front of  the body beneath the chest. The  figure is adorned with jewellery – bracelets, necklace, long earrings,  footrings – and with an upawita. The head is slightly bent down and gives  the impression of  being in a concentrated meditation. The whole body  and the face have a soft, rounded shape. The neck has three wrinkles,  similar to those of  the Panji figure in the reliefs at Candi Mirigambar.  The armpits show hair.  The hair on the head consists of  some thick curls and is covered by  a cap with a sharp edge. As this figure is three-dimensional, we have the  rare opportunity to see the whole cap (fig. 10.13c/d).44 On the front and  the back the cap is pointed. Between the hair and the edge of  the cap a  small kind of  ribbon is placed. Seen from the side, the cap displays the  typical crescent-moon-like shape of  caps in depictions of  young noble- men in two-dimensional reliefs.45  The described features identify the image as a noble person. The lo- tus cushion and the upawita are indications of  the possible rank of  a deity.  The Grogol statue, in comparison, lacks the lotus cushion, the upawita,  and the rich adornments, such as bracelets, a necklace, and footrings.  Both figures, though the Selokelir statue to an even larger degree, display  soft forms of  the body and the face which are appropriate for the refined  character of  Panji. Stutterheim (1936b:334) claims this soft style is typi- cal of  the art of  Majapahit in the fifteenth century. This in fact becomes  evident in a comparison with other examples from the fifteenth century,  such as the reliefs from Candi Mirigambar and from Candi Kendalisodo,  with reliefs of  the fourteenth century such as those on the Pendopo  Terrace at Candi Panataran, which display a stiffer style.  We do not know the exact original placement of  the image. Was it  standing on top of  one of  the sanctuaries? Was it accompanied by other  43 Some inscriptions are mentioned in O.V. 1915:4. 44 The Grogol statue, which would have provided another opportunity to view the cap from all sides,  is no longer extant. OD-photos only display the profile. 45 See the panels depicting Panji wearing a cap on the Pendopo Terrace at Candi Panataran. 319 </page> <page sequence="28"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs statues?46 The fact that the figure is freestanding like that from Grogol  has led Lunsingh Scheurleer (2000:200-1) to suggest that the statue  represents a deity. She presents this idea in the context of  her argument  that characters such as Panji and Bhima rose to the status of  deities dur- ing the Majapahit period. I suggest a slightly different variation of  this  interpretation, namely that Panji and Bhima were worshipped in the  same way as deities, but were not regarded as proper deities. I agree that  Panji’s being represented in a statue shows that Panji was indeed wor- shipped as a high-ranking character, all the more so because the Selokelir  figure is depicted standing on a lotus cushion and having the upawita,  which are common elements in the depiction of  a deity.  A certain group of  deity statues in the late Singasari and the  Majapahit period have been investigated by Klokke (1994, 1998). These  statues had formerly been considered as portrait statues of  historical  kings and queens. They display typical features of  deity statues: four  arms, standing on a lotus cushion, and having an upawita. Klokke comes  to the conclusion that they should more appropriately be called deifica- tion images. She argues these male statues do not have individual facial  features, given that most of  them have a female counterpart with the  same facial features. Thus they cannot portray individuals. Another  aspect of  the statues which must be accounted for is their hand gesture,  which indicates meditation. The Old Javanese esoteric text Jnanasiddhanta  (Haryati Soebadio 1971) and the Nagarakertagama provide further sources  for Klokke’s argumentation. The Jnanasiddhanta refers to meditation as a  means to acquire the ultimate truth and to unify with the Supreme God.  The Nagarakertagama (Nag. 40-48; Robson 1971:52-9) mentions many  deceased kings who were unified with a particular god. From all these  sources Klokke concludes that the images are not individual portraits,  but represent kings and queens meditating in order to become unified  with the particular deity, and so become deified. The Panji statue and these deification images possess a few common  features: the stiff  posture of  the body, standing on a lotus cushion, with  a lotus bud held in the hand, and the head slightly bent downwards.  However, there are many differences as well: the Panji statue only has  46 During my visit in 2011 I could not detect any trace in the site which would allow me to decide what  the original placement of  the sculpture was. The female statue from Mojokerto (inv. no. 310), exhibited  in the National Museum in Jakarta, shows iconographic traits resembling the Panji statue. Further re- search is required to analyse whether the two statues form an original pair. 320 </page> <page sequence="29"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan | two arms, rather than the four arms characteristic of  these particular  deities; Panji only holds one hand in front of  the body and not both  hands together in a mudra of  meditation; the garment and adornment  of  the Panji statue is very simple; the statue is depicted wearing not a  crown but a cap. The Panji figure has hair under the armpit, a feature  not appropriate for a deity image, which assigns Panji a human status.  Considering all these aspects of  similarities and differences, I conclude  that the Panji statue cannot represent a deity. However, the similarities to  the deification images emphasize that indeed Panji had risen to a deity- like rank without being an actual divinity.  The Selokelir statue is an extraordinary example of  the development  of  local East Javanese features, particularly within the context of  the pol- itical and religious conditions during fifteenth-century Majapahit. Panji  formed part of  a local Javanese cult which had developed independently  of  the old Indian tradition, and he had become an object of  worship.  Traces of  this cult were already found in the existence of  the earlier  Grogol statue and in the depiction of  panel 9 at Candi Mirigambar  where a woman sits in a sembah posture in front of  the high-positioned  Panji. The Panji figure of  Selokelir represents the climax of  this increas- ing rate of  worship of  Panji in the late Majapahit period. Hunter (2001) argues that there was a revival of  the Indian culture in  Java in the fifteenth century. Heroes of  the Indian epics were raised to a  new, semi-divine status similar to Panji. Bhima’s exorcist and purificatory  qualities were intensified in myths such as the Bhimasuci, and Hanuman’s  bravery and his mystic qualities were, for example, exposed in the  Ramayana reliefs at Panataran. They were frequently depicted in temple  reliefs and in statues, and were worshipped in an even more fervent way  than Panji.47 In a way, Bhima and Hanuman play a similar role as Panji,  that is, as intermediaries between the wordly sphere and the Divine.  However, while Bhima and Hanuman act on the level of  the ‘mythologi- cal stories’, Panji does so within the ‘post-mythological stories’ – visually  expressed, for example, through the different kinds of  headgears. I assign  a more human character to Panji than to Bhima and Hanuman, which  47 For the Bhima cult, see Stutterheim 1935a; Sbeghen 2004; Duijker 2010. For the Hanuman cult,  see Klokke 2006, and Kieven 2011. The increase of  the Hanuman worship in India at the same time  is perhaps an indication of  mutual influence between India and Java (Lutgendorf  1994, 1997). Besides  Bhima and Hanuman, Lunsingh Scheurleer (2000) discusses other new objects of  worship in East Java,  such as Garuda. 321 </page> <page sequence="30"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs makes Panji even more appropriate as an intermediary. Panji does not  usually act in an exorcist way, although, interestingly, Sidapaksa does  when depicted as a nobleman with a cap in Candi Surowono. A particular element of  the Selokelir statue, the lotus bud, might  express still another symbolic meaning. The figure holds the lotus bud  in front of  the lower part of  the chest (fig. 13b). This part of  the body  corresponds to the position of  the Anandakanda-padma, the seat of  the  ishtadewata, in the Tantric Kundalini path, which is located beneath the  Anahata-cakra of  the heart.48 The Anandakanda-padma is usually visually  represented with eight petals (Pott 1966:34). Due to erosion we cannot  decipher the number of  petals of  the depicted lotus flower here, so we  do not know if  an exact correspondence was given. However, the fact  alone that the lotus was held in front of  the Anandakanda-padma suggests  that Panji is pointing to this very cakra, and is thus indicating the Tantric  Kundalini path. This is emphasized by the meditative posture of  the  figure, given that meditation is an essential element in Tantric practice.  Zoetmulder’s findings support my argument: We saw that the purpose of  the yogi is to cause the god to be present  within his body, so that he will be able to concentrate on him with all his  faculties. The repeated mention of  the lotus in the manggalas points in that  direction, as we saw that the lotus of  the heart [anandakandapadma] is the  seat of  the istadewata. [...] ‘Although in visible form in the lotus (pangkaja),  he [the god] is in the fullest sense and essentially immaterial.’ [Zoetmul- der quoting Hariwijaya 1.1.]  (Zoetmulder 1974:183) [...] the meditation which concentrates solely upon the god in the heart- lotus [...]. (Zoetmulder 1974:184) Throughout the previous decades the cap had developed as a well- known and popular feature to characterize the depiction of  a nobleman  and Panji in particular; Panji was clearly connected to the mundane  world. Through the widespread and frequently enacted role of  Panji  as an intermediary between the mundane and the sacred, the Selokelir  48 Compare Chapter IV, sub-chapter ‘Tantrism’, and Chapter VII on Candi Panataran. 322 </page> <page sequence="31"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan | statue represented this intermediary position as well as a closer affilia- tion to the sacred sphere, owing to its deity-like attributes. This figure  incorporates both spheres at the same time: the mundane and the sacred.  Thus Panji is the intermediary par excellence. I found a nice correspondence in the text by Michele Stephen (2010),  in which she interprets Tantric Kundalini yoga to be inherent to the  Balinese cremation ceremony. She describes this ceremony as the dis- solution of  the material body into ether, by which the soul is set free  from earthly bonds. This dissolution is a complex process consisting of   three steps: (1) the material body dissolves into the subtle body; (2) the  subtle body, symbolized by the puspa-flower piercing the sixth cakra ajna  between the eyebrows, dissolves into the body of  bliss; (3) the ‘third and  final body [is then] freed from all material ties, [and] the spirit returns to  its orgin, [...] pure spirit’ (Stephen 2010:465). While the first two steps  are described in Balinese esoteric texts, the final body is only known  or admitted to be known by few Balinese ritual specialists (Stephen  2010:464), indicating its high esoteric and secret character. I see the cor- respondence with the role of  Panji as follows: (1) Panji in his mundane  character is a symbol of  the material body; (2) Panji holding the lotus in  front of  the heart prepares for the puspa to pierce the sixth cakra, which  means he prepares for the subtle body to dissolve into the body of  bliss.  Panji himself  does not fully manifest the body of  bliss, he only prepares  for it. Neither does he represent the pure spirit of  the third and final  body, but he prepares the ground. Again he functions as an intermediary.  Since the essence of  Balinese rituals can be traced back to Old Javanese  origins, I think that this comparison supports my understanding of  the  symbolism of  Panji, as expressed in the Selokelir statue.49 conclusion The three sites under scrutiny display different forms of  the symbolism  of  Panji. They all have in common that Panji acts as the intermediary  49 I propose an interpretation of  Panji, one that goes beyond the interpretations I have developed so  far. The Panji statue of  Selokelir resembles the shape of  a lingga in an anthropomorphic way, which is un- derlined by the cap, which looks similar to the glans. Applying the symbolism of  the lingga as producing  the life-giving amerta in union with the female, the Tantric principle is being signalled. This idea deserves  more discussion, though it is beyond the scope of  this book.  323 </page> <page sequence="32"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs between the mundane world and the sacred world and guides the pilgrim  to proceed to an understanding of  the religious doctrine.  Candi Kendalisodo demonstrates in its architectural layout and its  relief  depictions a concise form of  the Tantric path. Panji in the Panji  story prepares the pilgrim, who comes from the mundane world, for his/ her encounter with the esoteric teaching in the hermitage. The progress  from the mundane to the supra-mundane stage, typical for the layout  of  the East Javanese temples, is here in Candi Kendalisodo displayed  in horizontal form – first the pemujaan, then progressing to the pertapaan.  This dichotomy corresponds, as in many other sites, to the two genres of   the depicted stories: the ‘post-mythological stories’ – the Panji story on  the pemujaan – and the ‘mythological stories’ – Arjunawiwaha and Bhimasuci  on the pertapaan. In Candi Yudha again Panji functions as a character who helps  the worshipper to enter the sacred world and to prepare him for the  Tantric path. While in Candi Kendalisodo the emphasis lay on the  spiritual accomplishment, Candi Yudha’s focus was more on the quali- ties of  a kshatriya who was able to defeat the destroyer of  the world order.  Although no Panji story is depicted, the well-known Panji figure acts as  the intermediary person who takes the visitor by the hand and points to  the essential messages embedded in the relief  depictions. Panji and the  kadeyan are sufficient to act as indicators and intermediaries.  The communities who used the sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan  were multiple. There were hermits who stayed permanently in the sites  and received pilgrims who sought advice in religious matters. These  hermits had withdrawn from the world, many of  them coming from  an aristocratic background. Many pilgrims were members of  the royal  or wealthy families who might also have been the donors for the sanc- tuaries. Most likely, some of  the sanctuaries were more exclusive than  others. Kendalisodo seems to have been the ultimate and most exclusive  hermitage within a large mandala of  sanctuaries, and was entered only by  particular seekers of  Knowledge. Candi Yudha formed part of  a small  group of  sanctuaries which functioned as places of  worship and were less  exclusive. The visit of  this group may have prepared the pilgrim to pro- ceed higher on the mountain to hermitages such as Candi Kendalisodo,  where they received the final teaching in the religious and, particularly,  the Tantric doctrine. The symbolism of  the reliefs played a different role  for these different categories of  visitors. For the adepts willing to undergo  324 </page> <page sequence="33"> Chapter X Sanctuaries on Mount Penanggungan | teaching by the rshi, the reliefs symbolized the Tantric path, and particu- larly the Panji reliefs helped in the gradual approach to the final goal of   this path. For a short-term pilgrim or more common people the secrets  of  the Tantric path were less obviously illustrated. The highest sacred  doctrine was kept secret and was only to be accessed by the initiated.  This seclusion on a spiritual level corresponds with the geographical se- clusion and the remote location of  the sites on the mountain slopes. The  adept made a strong spiritual effort to achieve the Highest Wisdom; on a  concrete level the adept had to make the physical effort of  climbing the  mountain to access the remote sites.  That the search for religious knowledge had become more important  during the late Majapahit period is reflected in the large number of  sanc- tuaries and hermitages on Mount Penanggungan. To a certain degree  this was probably due to the chaotic political situation of  the time, and  perhaps also due to a revival of  the Hindu-Buddhist beliefs against the  influences of  Islam. The hermitages were centres for the retreat from the  world and for religious teaching.  The symbolism of  Panji differed depending on the particular func- tion of  the site. In the hermitage of  Candi Kendalisodo he was a guide to  the religious/esoteric sphere; in the pemujaan of  Candi Yudha he guided  young aristocrats, showing them the way to ideal kshatriya-hood, which  included the preparation for the religious teaching. In all these cases  Panji depictions welcomed the visitors on their own mundane level, and  the Arjunawiwaha, Bhimasuci, and Ramayana reliefs belonged to the sacred  sphere which the worshippers and adepts could only enter with the help  of  a spiritual teacher. Panji continued in the role of  intermediary, a role  he had played in the temples of  preceding times. Panji’s symbolism as an  intermediary had become well established amongst the religious commu- nity and pilgrims. Panji, being a nobleman himself, would in particular  have attracted members of  the aristocracy, who would have compared  themselves with Panji.  The large number of  Panji depictions on Mount Penanggungan  reflects the increased importance and popularity of  this character dur- ing the Majapahit period. This came to a climax in the transformation  to a cult of  worship in the final phase of  Majapahit, as expressed in  the Selokelir statue. The fact that the practice of  this cult took place on  Mount Penanggungan in particular is because of  the peculiar shape of   the mountain, which had been considered sacred for many centuries.  325 </page> <page sequence="34"> | Following the cap-figure in Majapahit temple reliefs Since sculptures were usually only erected to depict deities, in the Grogol  statue and, subsequently, in the more elaborate form of  the Selokelir  statue Panji had risen to a very high status. The Selokelir statue with its  deity-like shape may even have allowed the pilgrim and worshipper to  entertain the prospect of  becoming divine him/herself  in the final re- lease from worldly bonds and in the union with the Divine. Panji, in his  half-human, half-divine appearance, was again the intermediary in this  process. The Panji statue on Mount Penanggungan marks the climax of   this whole process. Mount Penanggungan itself  is the sacred world to which the Panji  statue points. The status of  Panji as a guide is reinforced by the loca- tion of  the statue on the foot of  the mountain. Panji would welcome  the pilgrims on this spot and guide them in proceeding higher up, to  the sanctuaries placed on the upper slopes of  the mountain, where they  would receive esoteric teaching. Thus, the Selokelir statue represents the  essence of  the symbolism of  Panji. 326 </page> </plain_text>
