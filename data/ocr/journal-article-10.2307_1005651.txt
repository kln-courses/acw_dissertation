CHARACTERISTICS Are these the Works, which thy Admirers say Are written in the Gentlemanly Way? -A Poem Occasion'd by Reading Shaftesbury's Characteristics. The literary and philosophical work, Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, etc., by Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, grandson of Dryden's Achitophel, was one of the most widely-read and influential books of the eighteenth century. Vari- ously reviled and lauded in that century for its out- spoken deism, the Characteristics is now important as the first thorough treatment of esthetics in English and as the manifesto of the movement to establish morality as independent of religion. With few exceptions, Shaftesbury was attacked by nearly every anti-deist of the century, but was enthusi- astically praised by such writers as James Thomson, Francis Hutcheson, Lord Monboddo, Diderot, Voltaire, and Herder. The learned and acid Isaac Watts at- tributed the popularity of the Characteristics entirely to a strong tincture of infidelity and profane sneers at Christianity. Although granting the work "a lively pertness, a parade of literature, and much of what some folks now-a-days call politeness," Watts wondered "how a book, in the main so loosely written, should ever ob- tain so many readers amongst men of sense." The poet Thomas Gray, however, supplied six famous rea- sons to account for Shaftesbury's vogue: first, he was a lord; secondly, he was as vain as any of his readers; thirdly, men are very prone to believe what they do not understand; fourthly, they will believe any thing at all, provided they are under no obligation to believe it; fifthly, they love to take a new road, even when that road leads no where; sixthly, he was reckoned a fine writer, and seems always to mean more than he said. 1 The research for this study was undertaken with the support of two grants from the Penrose Fund of the American Philo- sophical Society. Shaftesbury's influence was strong even on those whose training was established on contrary principles. Ezra Stiles, early President of Yale, read the Charac- teristics "during the rise, height, and decline, of his scepticism," and particularly admired Shaftesbury's "sublime views of Nature, and of the moral govern- ment of the Most High." Like most other readers he was particularly charmed with the portion of the work called "The Moralists: A Philosophical Rhapsody," having "no thoughts of deism, and least of all that this was the deists' bible, or their favourite author." John Newton, slaver, Christian convert and friend of the poet Cowper, was deceived in similar fashion by Shaftesbury's rhapsody, which he studied so ardently that he could almost repeat it verbatinm. Also unaware of its design and tendency, he "thought the author a most religious person" and that he had only to follow him to be happy. A certain free-thinker, however, taking advantage of his attachment to the Character- istics, almost destroyed his religious faith by interpret- ing its ambiguous passages in an anti-Christian sense, convincing Newton that he had never really understood the book. The early experience of Benjamin Franklin followed a similar pattern except that he retained his scepticism throughout life. From reading Shaftesbury he became "a real doubter in many points of our religious doc- trine," and throughout his life he retained many con- cepts of benevolent morality originally acquired from Shaftesbury. The beauty of Shaftesbury's language and the sub- limity of his conceptions entranced other readers who remained unaware of his deism or impervious to it. Mrs. Elizabeth Carter knew not whether she was in her right mind after reading his rhapsody, her head being filled "with beauties, and love, and harmony, but all of a divine and mysterious nature." The Characteristics (London, 1711) is composed of six treatises, five of which had appeared previously in pamphlet form. In the Characteristics, Shaftesbury does not present these treatises in the order of original publication, but in a new order which he thinks will best reveal his thought. First appears, A Letter con- cerning enth-usiasm, which had originally been pub- lished in 1708; second, Sensus Commiinunis: an Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Huimtour, originally published in 1709; third, Soliloquy, or Advice to an Author, orig- inally published in 1710; fourth, Awl Inquiry concerning Virtue and Merit, originally published in 1699; and, fifth, The Moralists; a Philosophical Rhapsody, orig- inally published in 1709. Four of these five tracts are reprinted verbatim, but An Inquiry is completely re- written, the major changes occurring in style, not in 297</page><page sequence="3">298 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. thought. To these five treatises, Shaftesbury added a number of explanatory and critical footnotes, an elab- orate system of cross-references, and a sixth treatise, Miscellaneous Reflections, which serves as a lengthy commentary on the preceding works. Of primary importance in a brief survey of Shaftes- bury's thought is his protest against Hobbes's ethical doctrine and against the assumption of certain divines that the foundation of conduct is the expectation of re- wards and punishments in a future state. This protest rests on Shaftesbury's assumption that men are not entirely selfish in their motives, but that benevolent impulses also are operative. Only benevolent or un- selfish acts, he maintains, can be properly termed vir- tuous. Shaftesbury's related view that virtue is man's greatest good and that virtue is within the reach of every man, somewhat erroneously described by some critics as a doctrine of optimism, reflects his approach to the problem of evil. The doctrine of virtue is in- separably connected in Shaftesbury's esthetics with the Platonic concept that truth, beauty, and good are the same. He believes that the perception of good is much like the perception of beauty, that a moral sense gives us unerring insight into the beauty of objects, thoughts, and conduct. Although all men have moral sense, he asserts, a taste for beauty in form and action must be developed by rigorous training. Opponents of Shaftes- bury frequently ridicule these concepts unfairly by al- leging that they place true virtue on a level with ap- probation of the beauty of geometrical figures or the harmony of music. A further important doctrine of the Characteristics, one which has been neglected until now, is the political view that religious worship should not be imposed by the state or the magistrate. The Characteristics is one of the earliest major literary works to enunciate the doctrine of separation of church and state. The essence of Shaftesbury's ethical system was pre- sented in his earliest work, An Inquiry concerning Vir- tue, said to have been written when he was but twenty years of age and published in 1699 when he was twenty- eight. In 1708 Shaftesbury's views were presented in lighter vein in A Letter concerning Enthusiasm, osten- sibly a review of the most absorbing human interest story of that year, the excesses of a group of religious fanatics, culminating in their effort to raise one of their number from the dead. Shaftesbury's vindication of providence, an answer to the Manicheanism of his friend Bayle, is found in The Moralists. The rhap- sodical and Platonic overtones of this dialogue com- bined with Shaftesbury's esthetic concept of virtuoso- ship have given rise to erroneous attempts to ascribe romantic and mystical symbolism to Shaftesbury's thought. Analysis of the theory of virtuosoship reveals, however, that Shaftesbury's esthetic concepts are ac- tually a logical extension of the stoic and classical train- ing which dominated his tastes and conduct throughout his life. Shaftesbury was vitally interested in contem- porary philosophy, and his work contains original com- ments on the thought of Locke, Hobbes, and Descartes as well as on lesser known theorists. Perhaps the best estimate of Shaftesbury's contemporary influence is found in the vast number of his intellectual opponents, including such stalwart antagonists as Mandeville and Berkeley. The best-known works of both authors were written in large measure to counteract the influence of Shaftesbury, even though they attempt to do so from almost antithetical principles. Throughout. the eighteenth century Shaftesbury was variously regarded as an orthodox Christian, a deist, and an infidel. Much of this confusion is caused by inadequate knowledge of the background of Shaftes- bury's work. Many of the so-called anti-Christian passages in the Characteristics are not anti-Christian at all, but merely vigorous protests against the efforts of organized religion to assume political powers. Other passages ridicule a literal interpretation of the Scrip- tures and snipe at absurd doctrines and traditions, a method in which Shaftesbury was preceded by Bayle and followed by Bolingbroke, Voltaire, and Paine. In itself, this higher criticism, no matter how flippant, is not anti-Christian, for Shaftesbury cites such clergymen as Tillotson and Jeremy Taylor who had preceded him in exposing the weaknesses of the doctrine of literal inspiration. Shaftesbury drew the wrath of the ortho- dox upon himself not so much for his ridicule of the Scripture as for his unequivocal insistence that ridicule is a legitimate weapon to be used against imposture in all subjects, including religion. Shaftesbury's critics, especially those of the eighteenth century, have devoted more space to this doctrine, which they interpret to mean that ridicule is a test of truth, than to any other aspect of the Characteristics. It is also a primary rea- son for his being generally classified as a deist. DISCRIMINATION OF DEISMS The essence of deism consists in the view that the existence and sovereignty of the divine being may be discovered by man's reason unassisted by revelation. Two major forms in the eighteenth century may be designated as scientific deism and humanistic deism. The former, which derives from the scientific method and discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton, professes to dis- cover God through the signs of order and contrivance in the physical universe; the latter, which derives from Shaftesbury's moral-philosophical speculation, professes to discover God through the moral nature of man. Even though scientific deism modified the original tenets of Newtonianism, the description of the latter system in Benjamin Martin's A Panegyrick on the Newtonian Philosophy fits scientific deism as well. "The Business of this Science," he says, is to enable us, in a proper manner to consider the HEAV- ENS, that is, the infinite Space, the interminable Void, the To-pan, or Universe, of all created Worlds, the Sun and</page><page sequence="4">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 1951] CHARACTERISTICS 299 Stars which God has ordain'd; it shews us that Suns and Stars are synonymous, and must equally imply those im- mense Fountains of Light and Heat, which, in form, govern and animate a system of revolving Planets: And thus it astonishes the Mind with a certain indubitable Proof and Prospect of an Infinity of Worlds, and creates an Idea every way worthy of, and adequate to the Notions we ought to entertain of an infinitely wise, perfect, and powerful Being. Shaftesbury's identical end of supporting faith in the divine order was based on arguments from a contrary direction. His declared purpose was to lead his read- ers "into such an Apprehension of the Constitution of Mankind and of human Affairs, as might form in 'em a Notion of Order in Things, and draw hence an Ac- knowledgment of that Wisdom, Goodness, and Beauty, which is supreme." The glimpse of the divine being which the Newtonians sought in the natural universe, Shaftesbury discovered in man. Whether based directly on the writings of Newton and Shaftesbury or not, the principal works of English deism followed one or the other of these two plans. Not only religious and philosophical treatises but also poetical works such as Thomson's Seasons sometimes combined the two forms of deism, making it now diffi- cult for us to separate their distinctive elements. The problem is further complicated by the fact that although scientific deism was derived from Newtonianism, all elements of Newtonianism are not deistical. Since Newton and most of his literary disciples were sincere Christians who deplored the attempts of deists to make religion independent of revelation, we must distinguish between Newtonianism and scientific deism. In a strict sense, Newtonianism consists of no more than Newton's mathematical and experimental discov- eries, the application of them to practical problems in the history of science, and their influence upon general literature. A study of the latter phase is Marjorie Nicolson's recent book on Newton's Optics as a source of poetical imagery and speculation concerning the esthetics of light and color. Newtonianism of the scien- tific laboratory is definite and concrete, and we can be relatively certain of what it is. The laws of motion and optics can be stated as the primary element of Newtonianism. In the minds of most of its adherents, moreover, New- tonianism was equivalent to the inductive method of reasoning. Henry Pemberton, for example, considered as a first principle that we must not "indulge conjectures concerning the powers and laws of nature, but to make it our endeavour . . . to search out the real and true laws by which the constitution of things is regulated." This is as much Baconianism as Newtonianism, how- ever, and few Newtonians conformed to the rigorous- ness of this prescription. Even Pemberton did not in- sist that each man set up his own laboratory. He felt that his View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy, 1728, a popularized treatment, made it possible for every gentleman to "form a comprehensive view of the stu- pendous Frame of Nature, and the Structure of the Universe, with the same Ease he now acquires a Taste of the Magnificence of a Plan of Architecture . . . without engaging in the minute and tedious Calcula- tions necessary to their Production." Other Newton- ians, however, maintained that each man must perform experiments for himself and not rely on the findings of others. In addition to reading the best scientific books, especially systematic ones, he must own and use such scientific instruments as the telescope, air-pump, barom- eter, and particularly the microscope, which was con- sidered to reveal more of nature's secrets than all the other optical instruments put together. With these in- struments, he must carry out a full course of experi- ments. Benjamin Martin believed that Newtonian phi- losophy could be understood by no other method. Such deists as Franklin and Paine may be called Newtonians largely by virtue of their following an experimental procedure in astronomy or physics. Franklin, an ac- quaintance of Pemberton's, carried on electrical and meteorological experiments throughout his life, and Paine in his twenties "purchased a pair of globes, and attended the philosophical lectures of Martin and Fer- guson." Experimental method was an essential feature of Newtonianism, but Newtonianism is not exclusively experimental. Its mathematical basis is obviously a priori, and despite Newton's iterated aversion to hy- pothesis, there are several in his thought. Newton's scientific discoveries have various ramifications in meta- physics. Newton himself drew some metaphysical con- clusions from his positivist method, and his disciples extended the speculative process, sometimes extracting contradictory consequences from his physical discov- eries. For this reason Newtonianism cannot be limited to a particular method of investigation. The same amplitude in scope which makes it impos- sible to define Newtonianism as experimental method keeps it from being, what some critics have attempted to see in it, a rigorous limitation of knowledge to that which can be proved without possibility of doubt. Al- though the Newtonians certainly expressed the desira- bility of attaining certitude, Pemberton admitted that proofs in natural philosophy cannot be as conclusive as those in mathematics since the latter are ideas in our own minds, whereas the former are outside our minds. Hence Pemberton considered it necessary merely "to steer a just course between the conjec- tural method of proceeding [raising philosophical sys- tems]; . . . and demanding so rigorous a proof as will reduce all philosophy to mere scepticism." The Newtonian doctrine which had greatest influence on deism was the metaphysical view that nature itself is both a divine revelation and a proof of the existence of God. This view was widely extracted by Newtonians from Newton's scientific works and was specifically ex- pressed by Newton himself in a series of letters to Bent- ley. The latter in sermons against atheism had used</page><page sequence="5">300 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. the motion of the planets to prove the existence of God, and Newton had confirmed his arguments in personal letters written after the delivery of the sermons. The essence of the argument is that the principle of gravity is inadequate by itself to explain the systematic motion of the stellar universe. Gravity might give the planets a motion of descent toward the sun, but "the transverse motions by which they revolve in their several orbs re- quired the divine arm to impress them according to the tangents of their orbs." That the motion must have been impressed by an intelligent agent is proved, more- over, by the differences in velocity between various planets and satellites. The same form of argument- with more attention to a priori elements-formed the basis of Samuel Clarke's A Discourse concerning the Being antd Attributes of God, 1706. Clarke argued that some being must have existed from eternity and that this being cannot be the material world. The ex- istence of an intelligent being is proved from the orig- inal of motion: motion either began or is eternal; if it began it must have a cause; if eternal, it must have a cause or be necessary and self-existent; if self-existent, there can be nothing at rest. That the "supreme Cause and Author of all Things, must of Necessity be Infi- nitely Wise" is proved both a priori and a posteriori by his works "evidenced more illustriously in the late Dis- coveries in Astronomy and Natural Philosophy." The same pattern is repeated by scores of writers, including William Wollaston in his popular theological work with the deistical title, The Religion of Nature Delineated, 1722. One of the most interesting manifestations of the argument is an early work of Thomas Paine's, "The Existence of God" based directly on Newton's letters to Bentley. Paradoxically, this statement by an arch- deist later circulated in England as a religious tract with the title "Atheism Refuted." In Shaftesbury also we find purple passages con- cerning the revelation of God through nature. We read in The Moralists: "All Nature's Wonders serve to ex- cite and perfect this Idea of their Author. 'Tis here he suffers us to see, and converse with him, in a manner sutable to our Frailty. How glorious is it to contem- plate him, in this noblest of his Works apparent to us, the System of the bigger World!" There is much in this strain in the Characteristics, but it is not necessarily Newtonianism. Pythagorean and stoic thought were permeated with reasoning from nature to God, and the Shaftesburian cosmology is primarily stoic. Even though references to "liquid Ether" and gravity show that Shaftesbury probably knew of Newton's theories, yet Cicero or Pythagoras could just as well have in- spired the various rhapsodies in The Moralists concern- ing the multitude of fixed stars, visible and invisible, "Whence we are naturally taught the immensity of that BEING, who thro' these immense spaces has dispos'd such an infinity of bodys, belonging each (as we may well presume) to systems as compleat as our own world." Physico-theology and stoic terminology are related, but they are not of the same immediate family. The Newtonians, moreover, did not make a rigid dis- tinction between their demonstrations of the harmony of the system and the speculation of Pythagorean and stoic cosmologies. Desaguliers in The Newtoniant Sys- tem of the World, 1728, for example, asserted that "The System of the Universe, as taught by Pythagoras, Philo- laus, and others of the Ancients, is the same, which was since reviv'd by Copernicus, allow'd by all the unpreju- dic'd of the Moderns, and at last demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newton. . . . All the Difference between the modern and ancient System, is only what is added to it since the Invention of the Telescope." Closely allied in Newtonianism to the doctrine of har- mony in the universe is the doctrine of a plurality of inhabited worlds. Since we know that the earth is in- habited, Newtonians reasoned, we assume by analogy that the other planets are also. The philosopher, per- ceiving mountains and valleys in our moon, assumes that the same things are to be observed in the moons of Jupiter and Saturn by the inhabitants of these planets and hence infers that the globes in our system and in every system belonging to each star through all the in- finity of space "are so many habitable Worlds, of num- berless different Beings, possessing some Degree of animal and vegetable Life." This created in the mind a sublime and august idea of the divine author. Some Newtonians even based their belief in a future state on the curiosity which our observation of other planets raises. It does not seem reasonable and conformable to the wisdom of nature, they argued, that our curiosity should be thus greatly raised only to be disappointed in the end. According to Colin Maclaurin in Ain Account of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophical Discoveries, "we might conclude, that the like desires would be frustrated in the inhabitants of all the other planets" and that the system of nature would be unfolded in only an imperfect manner in all of them. This would lead to the conclu- sion then that our present state is only a probationary period for further advancement. Eighteenth-century references to a plurality of worlds cannot with any certitude, however, be attributed di- rectly to Newtonianism, for the doctrine goes back his- torically to Plato's Timaeus, it prevailed throughout the history of thought, and its basic features in the eight- eenth century were derived chiefly from theological and philosophical premises rather than from observation. This A. 0. Lovejoy has shown in detail in his study, The Great Chain of Being. The deists, moreover, used the doctrine against some of the orthodox assumptions of the Newtonians rather than to support themll. In Franklin, for example, the doctrine may have been sug- gested by the Newtonians, but since it depends upon polytheism-each system of sun and planets has its own God-it is safe to say that the doctrine is here a priori, deistical, and contrary to Newtonianism.</page><page sequence="6">VOL. 41. PT. 2. 19511 CHARACTERISTICS 301 Far from being a positivist or mechanistic view of the universe, Newtonianism was used also to uphold faith in the Christian miracles. Newtonian philosophy, ac- cording to Benjamin Martin, shows us that the first cause "may interpose to produce any of the Phaenomena of Nature, without interrupting the Course of her Op- erations in the ordinary way." The infinite wisdom which established the order of the generation of animals in the common way may at any time produce a maln, "either adult, as the first Adamt, or in Utero, from a special or peculiar Animalcule, as in the Incarnation of Christ: So that, in general, we hereby see that there is nothing absurd, unreasonable, or inconsistent with the Nature of Things, in the Doctrine of a miraculous Power." Newton himself accepted the literal inter- pretation of Scripture, including the miracles, as did most of the physico-theological school. Pope's footnote reference to Newton's Optics in An Essay on Man is designed to show that the universe is not mechanically perfect and that God must interpose occasionally to set it right. The foregoing elements are reasonably definite and were specifically stated by most Newtonians. Two cor- ollaries growing out of these elements may be added as less conscious but implicit features of Newtonianism. First is the ethical view, stemming originally from Soc- rates, that virtue consists of knowledge. It follows from the Newtonian assumptions that we cannot expect vir- tue of the same lustre in a little mind as in a great one, and that we cannot expect those who do not understand the natural rightness of the broad system to keep from transgressing the laws of right conduct. "If . . . we would have Mankind be virtuous, and act aright," said Benjamin Martin, "let their Minds be early form'd and embued with the Principles of Philosophy, i. e. of Wis- dom and Knowledge." The equating of virtue with knowledge is the basis of the moral theory of Samuel Clarke, the ethical phi- losopher of Newtonianism, who defined virtue as the conformity of our actions with certain eternal and im- mutable relations and differences of things, or of the fitness of things. It is the basis also of Wollaston's The Religion of Nature Delineated in which virtue is defined as acting according to truth and treating things as they are. As I shall show later, this view distinguishes New- tonians from Shaftesbury, who maintained that virtue consists not in knowledge but in following the dictates of moral sense or good affections, and from other deists, who held elemental reason or the light of nature to be a sufficient guide to conduct and who asserted that nothing can be regarded as necessary knowledge which is beyond the comprehension of the ordinary man. The second corollary-that a parallel exists between the harmony of the physical universe and ideal political relationships-is the foundation of Desaguliers' alle- gorical poem, The Newtontian System of the World, the Best Model of Governmeent, 1728, in which the monarch is compared to the sun, and the chief ministers to plan- ets who are impelled to him by a principle of attraction. This may be nothing but an ingenious conceit, but Paine also stated the parallel between physics and politics by asserting in The Rights of Man that man's "wants, act- ing upon every individual, impel the whole of them into society, as naturally as gravitation acts to a center." Scientific deism, an independent movement, with many elements common to Newtonianism, but almost as many contrary to it, also uses the Bentley-Newton- Clarke proof of the existence of God. No other feature is more important to scientific deism than reasoning from the harmony and order of the physical universe to the existence of God and to his moral attributes. Newtonians held that only science can be esteemed "a genuine Commentary on the Bible of Nature," but the deists went a little further and argued that science and reason are the only reliable sources of our knowledge of God. The doctrine of the plurality of worlds, although also common to both systems, illustrates in the consequences drawn from it, a fundamental difference in the two sys- tems. It was used by the Newtonians, to support the orthodox Christian doctrine of a future state. It was used by Paine, a scientific deist, to overthrow Christi- anity. Speaking in The Age of Reason of the plurality of worlds and the Christian doctrine of atonement, Paine asserted, "The two beliefs cannot be held together in the same mind; and he who thinks that he believes both, has thought but little of either." We must re- member, moreover, that the doctrine of several worlds is "scientific" only when based directly upon astronomi- cal observation. Otherwise it belongs to the moral- philosophical concept of the Great Chain of Being, which originated centuries before the discoveries of Newton and which is based almost entirely on a priori reasoning. Newtonian science was only a supplementary, not an essential, feature of deism, for some deists had no knowledge whatsoever of science. All of the tenets and presuppositions of deism, moreover, could be sup- ported entirely by a priori reasoning completely inde- pendent of scientific investigation. An important de- istical element quite independent of science was the discarding of revelation. Whether scientific or not, all deists with the exception of a few so-called "Christian deists" maintained that the knowledge of God obtained from reason was either contrary or at least superior to that from revelation. With Paine the deists cried, "The word of God is the creation we behold." When this attitude was combined with a knowledge of science, there arose a recognition of the conflict be- tween the Bible and science, a recognition which existed in incipient form even among the Newtonians. Not only such early deists as Blount and Woolston, who turned the Scriptures into allegory, but Newtonians like Desaguliers, who expressed contempt for those who quoted Scripture to prove the motion of the earth to be a heretical doctrine, were aware of the difficulties of interpreting the Scriptures in a literal sense. The con-</page><page sequence="7">302 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. flict between science and the Bible had already broken out in the seventeenth-century controversy over Thomas Burnet's A Sacred Theory of the Earth. Deists, how- ever, did not generally use science against Christianity. Even Paine did not attack the Bible on scientific grounds, but almost exclusively on textual and moral grounds. Other deists attempted to disparage Scrip- ture by drawing attention to such odd customs as polygamy which seem to be advocated therein. But whether based on scientific grounds or not, all anti- Biblicism was contrary to the spirit of Newtonianism. The position of the deists in regard to miracles was also the direct opposite of the Newtonians'. Even at the beginning of the eighteenth century, Christian apolo- gists asserted the authenticity of the Scripture miracles to be the fundamental proof of Christianity, a view which Shaftesbury ridiculed. Such other deists as Col- lins, Woolston, Bolingbroke, and Paine devoted much of their effort to disparaging and denying miracles, efforts of which the Newtonians would by no means have approved. The elements of deism most directly antithetical to Newtonianism, however, are those described by Pro- fessor Lovejoy as intellectual equalitarianism and ra- tionalistic anti-intellectualism. The deists, holding that human reason or the light of nature is universal and all sufficient, believed that nothing can be regarded as valid belief or needful knowledge which is beyond the comprehension of the ordinary man. Since all essential knowledge is available simply and clearly, they felt, subtle, elaborate reasonings about abstruse questions beyond the grasp of the majority are unimportant and the conclusions so drawn are probably not true. This is obviously contrary to the Newtonian zeal for indi- vidual experimentation and the theory that virtue is knowledge. The section in Pope's An Essay on Man asserting "That we can judge only with regard to our own systemn, being ignorant of the relations of systems and things" is a type of anti-intellectualism, an indirect attack on physico-theology and perhaps also on Clarke's ethical and epistemological doctrine of the relations and fitness of things. The related deistical doctrine that all knowledge including that of god and society is based upon reason-some of it available almost innately-also goes counter to the experimental basis of Newtonian- ism. The deistical theories of reason, requiring empiri- cism (reasoning only from what we know) but admit- ting certain deductive truths, were in a sense based on Locke; at the same time the concepts which they in- cluded of "the light of nature" and "the candle of the Lord," derived from seventeenth-century Latitudinarian divines, were anti-Locke in suggesting innate ideas. A third element, moral sense, added by Shaftesbury, was in his thought almost equivalent to reason, but converted to pure feeling by many of his followers. Since there are as many elements of deism contrary to Newtonianism as there are doctrines shared by New- tonians and scientific deists, the term "Newtonian de- ism," used as early as 1894 by Moncure D. Conway in his edition of Paine's works, seems to be inexact and unsatisfactory. The term "scientific deism," however, seems to be valid as a description of systems denying a Scriptural revelation and establishing a belief in God through the external evidence of contrivance and design in the universe. The parallel term "humanistic deism" describes Shaftesbury's system, a system founded on a concept contrary to Newtonianism, and embracing several spe- cifically anti-Newton elements. Shaftesbury entered the literary world with his principle that the existence of God could be proved on moral grounds and that this was a higher principle than any material revelation on which to worship him. With Shaftesbury, the starting point is man. At the outset of his speculation, Shaftesbury specifi- cally says that it is possible for a rational creature "to have a Liking or Dislike of moral Actions, and conse- quently a Sense of Right and Wrong, before such time as he may have any settled Notion of a GOD." Shaftes- bury portrays man as a creature of reason and of affec- tions. Like most writers of the Augustan Age he takes the operation of reason for granted, but he presents in An Inquiry concerning Virtue a detailed analysis of the nature and function of the affections. The addition of moral sense to the faculties of man represents both Shaftesbury's most highly-publicized contribution to thought and the weakest part of his system. Moral sense is usually interpreted as a type of intuition, and Shaftesbury certainly uses it to explain the existence of non-empirical knowledge and concepts. Hence it is basic to his principle of the moral nature of man and the universe. The weakness of the concept, however, is that it is nowhere clearly defined or explained. In some sections of the Characteristics it is not to be dis- tinguished from reason, and in others it is almost equivalent to innate ideas. It represents variously knowledge and a motivation to action. Regardless of the exact nature of moral sense, however, its function is to bring the individual to knowledge of supreme truth, good and beauty. In Shaftesbury's system before ascending into the higher regions of divinity, "it is necessary to descend a little into ourselves, and bestow some poor Thoughts upon poor honest Morals." From self-knowledge we proceed to the divine, realizing that we must suppose goodness and beauty in the universal whole on which is based our own moral affection and love of goodness and virtue. After we are sure of the pervasive presence of affection and love in nature, "there remains then only to consider of the Object, whether there be really that Supreme-One we suppose. For if there be divine Excellence in Things; if there be in Nature a supreme Mind or DEITY; we have then an Object consummate, and comprehensive of all which is good or excellent." The central doctrine of Shaftesbury's thought is the correlative nature of order in the universe and order</page><page sequence="8">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 1951] CHARACTERISTICS 303 in the individual, a stoic variant of the familiar medi- aeval concept of microcosm and macrocosm, a doctrine the Newtonians would not challenge. Shaftesbury maintained, however, that the primary study should be man's moral conduct rather than mysteries of science. When Pope says that the proper study of man is man, he is echoing Shaftesbury. Apart from this fundamental difference in direction, there are several specifically anti-Newtonian elements in the Characteristics. First of all, Shaftesbury ridi- cules the fundamental Newtonian principle of proving the existence of God by "a first cause, a first being, and a beginning of motion." He clearly regards this type of reasoning as inferior to his own stoic-Platonic principle of a unity in nature. If we are convinced that "there is at this present a universal Mind," he argued, "'twill easily be yielded that there ever was one." Shaftesbury went even further in ridiculing the New- tonian prescription for experimental activity. At least his condemnation of the inferior virtuosi who pass from a study of mankind to a minute examination of "the insect-life, the conveniencys, habitations and OEconomy of a race of shell-fish," would seem to be a reflection on the Newtonian zeal for microscopic research. The doctrine of a future state, moreover, which the New- tonians regarded as a fundamental truth, Shaftesbury considered as mercenary and slavish, and, like the stoics, he felt that a satisfactory system of ethics could be built on the assumption that the present existence is the only one. This is not to say that the Character- istics is not proportionately as full of references to the glory and order of the universe as are the works of the Newtonians, but in Shaftesbury they are derived from stoic morality, not Newtonian science. Shaftesbury finds in nature a "uniting principle," a oneness, which may be Plotinian or Stoic, but is not Newtonian. The harmony of the individual mind with the universe-a stoic concept-Shaftesbury introduced in the Character- istics in order to inculcate the moral doctrine of the subordination of the individual to the good of the whole and of the individual's passions to the good of the indi- vidual organism. One of the characters in The Moral- ists indeed remarks that "The contemplation of the universe, its laws and government, was (I aver'd) the only means which cou'd establish the sound belief of a DEITY," but Shaftesbury intends this remark solely to stigmatize belief in miracles. He does not use it to supersede his primary doctrine of the moral nature of man as proof of the deity, but to overthrow completely the view that miracles may be accepted as testimony of the divine. Even though the sky should open and all kinds of prodigies appear, he says, this might prove the existence of powers but not necessarily of an immortal, wise, benevolent, and omnipotent God. Like Bacon and Spinosa, Shaftesbury finds the only convincing proof of a divine being to be the order of the universe, not viola- tions of it. Since Newtonians were inclined to accept the intervention of a divine hand in the universal sys- tem, Shaftesbury's attitude is on the whole opposed to Newtonianism rather than favorable to it. The final difference between Shaftesbury and the Newtonians concerns ethical conduct. The Newtonian view equates virtue with knowledge, as we have seen, and in such moralists as Clarke and Wollaston virtue consists in following reason. In the Shaftesburian view, virtue is based upon good affections, and the practice of morality consists in following moral sense. Throughout the century the opposing views were frequently used as a basis for moral discussions. Sir John Hawkins in The Life of Samuel Johnsont, for example, lists three sects or classes of writers on morality. Shaftesbury, he says, "makes virtue to consist in a course of action con- formable to what is called the moral sense; Wollaston says it is acting . . . according to truth, and treating things as they are; Dr. Clarke supposes all rational agents as under an obligation to act agreeable to the relations that subsist between such or according to what he calls the fitness of things." Although it was fash- ionable to conceive of three independent systems and although a lively controversy among their exponents existed throughout the century, the differences are more superficial than real. Both Wollaston and Clarke based virtue on reason, and Shaftesbury's moral sense as it is developed in the Characteristics amounts to the rigid control of feeling by reason. Tom Jones's famous tutor Square, for example, represents a coalescence of the three systems. From Shaftesbury, he borrowed the phrase "the natural beauty of virtue" as well as the opinions that human nature is the perfection of all vir- tue, and that vice is a deviation from our nature in the same manner as deformity of body is. From Wollaston he derived the phrase "the unalterable rule of right," and from Clarke and his many disciples, he adopted the phrase, "the eternal fitness of things." This mixture is possible because Square represents merely rational mo- rality, common ground between the Shaftesburians and the Newtonians. Other areas may be found in which Shaftesbury and Newtonianism do not conflict. Shaftesbury no doubt would have agreed with Newton's principle that "If natural philosophy, in all its parts by pursuing the in- ductive method, shall at length be perfected, the bounds of moral philosophy will also be enlarged," but in the Characteristics the process is reversed. Shaftesbury considers the study of moral philosophy of such primary importance that it should precede even natural philoso- phy. Shaftesbury, furthermore, has no enthusiasm for the inductive method, but teaches that the inquiry into the nature of God and the universe may be pursued by pure reason. Whether scientific deism and humanistic deism are incompatible, they certainly are different. Among the universe-intoxicated Newtonians, nature is external, and we sometimes lose sight of man completely. In Shaftesbury, nature is just as much internal as external, and we are constantly reminded of man's inherent good</page><page sequence="9">304 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. affections. In the sense that the Characteristics reveals man himself as so constituted in his own nature that he may perceive universal truth, good and beauty without the aid of a material revelation, Shaftesbury's work is literally the manifesto of deism. II. AN INQUIRY But still his merit you cannot regard, Who thus pursues a posthumous reward; "His soul," you cry, "is uncorrupt and great, Who, quite uninfluenc'd by a future state, Embraces virtue from a nobler sense Of her abstracted, native excellence, From the self conscious joy her essence brings, The beauty, fitness, harmony of things." -Soame Jenyns, On the Immortality of the Soul. To prove the existence of God without reference to Scripture is not in itself a sufficient manifesto of deism. Wollaston's The Religiont of Nature Delineated, for ex- ample, deliberately avoids all mention of revelation, but Wollaston remained a respected Christian theologian. Deism requires a certain amount of anti-Biblicism. Perceiving the iconoclastic passages in Miscellaneous Reflections in a total view of Shaftesbury, we can now be sure of his deism, but his first treatise, An Inquiry concerning Virtue, was not openly antagonistic to reve- lation. Theologians protested against it not because he established faith in the deity upon the moral nature of man-a doctrine not necessarily antithetical to Christi- anity-but because in so doing he condemned a favorite doctrine of orthodox divinity, that rewards and punish- ments in a future state are the only adequate motives to virtuous conduct in this life. Although an important part of Shaftesbury's treatise is a protest against this doctrine, it was not originally designed as a controversial piece. After circulating as a private document in manuscript form in a limited circle, the original version was given to the press in 1699 by John Toland while Shaftesbury was out of the country. According to tradition, Shaftesbury, greatly annoyed, immediately set about buying up this un- authorized edition before many of the books were sold. Letters among the Shaftesbury papers in the Public Records Office reveal, however, that Shaftesbury asked Pierre Desmaizeaux to translate his work into French in 1701, a request which casts much doubt on the tradi- tional account of his chagrin at its initial publication. Shaftesbury's immediate purpose in the Inquiry was to protest against the arguments of some clergymen that without the prospect of a future life, men would be more miserable than beasts and that the best of men would be often the most miserable. An idea of the currency of this doctrine may be found in a discourse by Francis Atterbury in which is brought together an incredible array of seventeenth-century authors who allegedly sup- port his manifesto of misery.' Tillotson had asserted that without hopes of a happier future life, "Mankind 1 Sermnons and Discourses 2: 20, London, 1740. would be the most imperfect and unhappy part of God's Creation"; Henry More that "If there be no Life here- after, the worst of Men have the greatest share of Hap- piness; their Passions and Affections being so contin- ually gratify'd"; Dr. Goodman that if man "have not hopes to counterbalance his Fears, and a Reward here- after for his Self-denial at present, his Condition is far the worst of any Creature in the World"; and Bishop Wilkins that if there be no future state of happiness, "not only Nature, but Virtue likewise must contribute to make Men miserable." Atterbury's quotations in support of the allied notion that without the expectation of a future life, physical sensations might be esteemed the whole measure of happiness and misery, are equally startling in their grim materialism. Tillotson had con- ceded that without hope of reward "Virtue is but a dead and empty Name," and that, if there be no future life, "the Apostle allows the reasoning of the Epicure to be very good; Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die." Dr. Scot had lugubriously reasoned that if there were no other life after this, it would be folly so much as to attempt "the Enjoyment of God by Contemplation and Love, and the Imitation of his Perfections." Dr. Sher- lock, in keeping with his view that Christianity "is no Religion for this World, were there not another Worldl to follow," had asked, "Where is the Man who would not comply with the Devil's Temptation, to fall down and worship for all the Kingdom's of the World, and the Glory of them, were he not to lose a brighter and a richer Crown for it ?" Glanvill more prosaically had asserted that "If this be all the Life of Man, his End and Happiness would then be to provide for the Body, and the Gratification of its Senses." At least two bish- ops had joined the melancholy chorus. Bishop Wilkins had flatly affirmed that "if there be no such thing to be expected as Happiness or Misery hereafter, why then the only Business that Men are to take care of, is their present well-being in this World," that if for gain or profit a man "can cheat or steal securely, this will be so far from being a Fault, that it is plainly his Duty; that is, reasonable for him to do; because it is a proper Means to promote his Chief Ends," and the same is true "for other Cases of Anger, Hatred, Revenge." Bishop Pearson with apparent conviction had stated that "Such is the Sweetness of our Sins, such the Connaturalness of our Corruptions, so great our Confidence of Impunity here, that, except we look'd for an Account hereafter, it were unreasonable to expect that any Man should for- sake his Delights, renounce his Complacencies by a se- vere Repentance, create a Bitterness to his own Soul." Shaftesbury was probably familiar with most of these writers mentioned by Atterbury as well as with a fa- mous sermon preached by Robert South on "The Rec- ompense of the Reward." In this sermon, preached on September 11, 1698, one year before the publication of An Inquiry, South attacked the "strange proposition" that "a Christian, in all acts of duty, ought to sequester his mind from all respect to an ensuing reward, and to</page><page sequence="10">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 1951] AN INQUIRY 305 commence his obedience wholly and entirely upon the love of duty itself, abstracted from all regard to any fol- lowing advantages whatsoever." 2 This doctrine, South declared, may be practical to angels, cherubims, and seraphims, but to ordinary mortals with less glorified natures it is an irrational paradox. South prefaced his statement of this paradox with the remark that it had for a long time "passed current with too many," show- ing that Shaftesbury was by no means the first to object to mercenary morality. The phrase "the recompense of the reward" comes from a verse in Hebrews (11: 26) describing Moses, who refused the title "son of Phar- aoh's daughter" and its accompanying pleasures, choos- ing rather to share the afflictions of God's people, "for he had respect to the recompense of the reward." In a letter to Lord Somers, June 2, 1709, Shaftesbury ridi- culed the clerical application of the phrase, and it is likely that he had it in mind when he wrote Ani Inquiry.3 South's sermon demonstrating the insufficiency of the view that "virtue is its own reward" is a typical state- ment of the theological justification of sensible rewards. South attempts to establish two principles, both of which are antithetical to Shaftesbury's system, first, that duty in itself is not a sufficient motive to doing one's duty, and second, that the proposal of a reward on God's part and a respect to it on man's are necessary to engage man in a course of duty and obedience. Modern readers may wish to discard this type of the- ology as obsolete bigotry, but it cannot be ignored in a treatment of Shaftesbury's thought. The issue was a vital one in his day, and Shaftesbury's concept of hu- manistic deism came in part as a reaction to the affirma- tions of divines like South. Shaftesbury's protest ante- dated a parallel treatise, A Letter to the Reverend Dr. Francis Atterbury (1706) by a well-known liberal theo- logian of the Augustan Age, Bishop Benjamin Hoadly. Like debaters on two different teams upholding the proposition, Resolved: that a high standard of conduct does not depend upon rewards and punishments in a future state, Shaftesbury and Hoadly used almost iden- tical arguments based on a common background and reasoning, but arrived at independently. Shaftesbury's An Inquiry represented the first round in a tournament. It raised at least one printed reply, Robert Day's Free Thoughts in Defence of a Future State: . . . With Oc- casiontal Remarks on a Book Ilntituled, An Inquiry con1- cerninig Virtue (1700), but neither Shaftesbury nor his opponent had much influence at this time. Six years later Francis Atterburv enunciated the doctrine of fu- ture rewards in a funeral sermon, and Hoadly wrote the letter mentioned above in protest. In rebuttal, Atter- bury reviewed the background of the controversy by presenting the impressive list of distinguished authors 2 Sermonis preached 1lpoII several occasionis 1: 345-355, Lon- don, 1859. 3 Benjamin Rand, ed., The life, tunpublished lettcrs, anid philo- sophical regimeni of . . .Shaftesbury, 401, N. Y., Macmillan 1900. already cited. Hoadly, in a second reply, asserted that most of the great men represented in Atterbury's heap of quotations resembled him only in general expressions, which they did not mean in his sense. Although there is no evidence that either Atterbury or Hoadly was aware of the earlier skirmish between Day and Shaftesbury, the latter took a keen interest in the subsequent progress of the dispute among clergy- men. "They for their parts," he wrote to a friend in 1709, "(witness Dr. A y against the good Mr. H-y) have asserted virtue upon baser principles, and more false and destructive by far, than Epicurus, . . . or any of the antient atheists." 4 Shaftesbury carried on the controversy in Sensus Communis and in The Mor- alists, both of which appeared in 1709, and in 1711 he printed a greatly improved version of An Inquiry as the keystone of his Characteristics. Until this time, the at- tack on rewards in a future state had been associated with Hoadly, but after the incorporation of An Inquiry into the Characteristics Shaftesbury became known as the chief foe of the doctrine. In the first book of An Inquiry, which treats the re- lation between religion and virtue, Shaftesbury shows, first of all, that everything in the universe is arranged according to a good order and agreeable to general in- terest; then he proceeds to the species and individuals of creatures within the universal system. Their con- duct, he states, is to be esteemed good or ill, natural or unnatural, according to their affection. We do not say that a man is good "when he abstains from executing his ill purpose through a fear of some impending punish- ment, or through the allurement of some exterior re- ward." 5 This, in essence, is Shaftesbury's objection to the doctrine of a future state. Since the nature of virtue consists "in a certain just disposition or proportionable affection of a rational creature towards the moral objects of right and wrong," only actions so motivated and without the expectation of reward can be denominated virtuous or meritorious. Individual conduct and virtue are greatly influenced by the belief or disbelief in God. If the deity be considered as an arbitrary power enforc- ing obedience to his absolute will by particular rewards and punishments and if, on this account, the creature be incited to do good or refrain from evil, "there is in this case . . . no virtue or goodness whatsoever." 6 If the deity be considered, on the other hand, as worthy and good, being understood to have, besides mere power and knowledge, "a high and eminent regard to what is good and excellent, a concern for the good of all, an(d an affection of benevolence and love towards the whole, such an example must undoubtedly serve . . . to raise and increase the affection towards virtue." Where this theistic belief is entire and perfect, the opinion of the superintendency of a supreme Being will vastly increase 4Letters of the Earl of Shaftesbury, 30, London, 1746. 5 J. M. Robertson, ed., Characteristics 1: 247, London, 1900. Hereafter cited as "Robertson." 6 Ibid. 1: 267.</page><page sequence="11">306 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. both the shame of guilty actions and the honor of just ones. The fear of future punishments, and the hope of reward, however, cannot be considered to stem from good affections, nor can this fear or hope be considered as consistent with goodness and merit. "If it be true piety to love God for his own sake, the over-solicitous regard to private good expected from him must of ne- cessity prove a diminution of piety." Day's initial protest against these principles is in the form of an analogy between actions done in prospect of advantage in a future state and those done out of regard to the present.7 As "He that takes an honest Care of the Interests of his own Person, Family, Friends and Country in this Life" is acknowledged to act rationally and wisely, so he who takes a diligent care of his own interests and the interests of others in a future state must likewise be acknowledged to act rationally and wisely; "and to act rationally and wisely, is to act vir- tuously." When Day answers Shaftesbury's fundamen- tal maxim that to do good in hope of reward increases the vicious principle of selfishness, he does so not by challenging the assertion, but by defending selfishness. His argument is a prevenient rebuttal of Shaftesbury's theories of the origin of society. First, he says, selfish- nless is innate, and no man may divest himself of it; sec- ond, the selfish principle is not vicious in its own nature, "but becomes so only by being pursued irregularly." An ordered society is regulated selfishness. Each mem- ber has voluntarily surrendered several of his natural rights for the better preservation of what he has not given up. Thus he is bound in reason and in conscience not to pursue his private interest to the detriment of the public or to the prejudice of another person who is in straits; to be selfish, however, when neither the pub- lic nor any private person is damaged thereby, "is natu- ral, necessary and honest," and he who does not then pursue his private interest is a fool or a madman. The prospect of reward has nothing in it to make selfishness vicious, "for a Man cannot do himself too much good, if in doing himself good he does others no injury." To Shaftesbury's substitution of the advantages and delight in virtue itself as the prime motive of virtuous conduct, Day replies that for the generality of mankind the love of virtue or even the realization that in this life there is more to be gained by virtue than by vice is still an insufficient motive. Devotees of sense may admit that virtue may have many charms and vice some im- mediate troubles or imminent dangers, "but they could be content a while with the Pleasures of Sense, bear the Troubles and venture the Dangers." Furthermore, even though it is generally granted that the virtuous man obtains present advantage through his virtue and the vicious man reaps suffering because of his vice, it is well known that very often the reverse exists. As long as it is even possible for a virtuous man to suffer 7 For a complete discussion of Day's treatise see: A. 0. Ald- ridge, Shaftesbury's earliest critic, Modern Philol. 44: 10-22, 1946. or a vicious man to prosper, how are men to be per- suaded to forego vice and seek virtue? Day refuses to pass over the notorious fact, which counts heaviest against Shaftesbury's scheme, that suffering and real ill in the world are likely to be the lot of the most virtu- ous. The extension of this reasoning is the strongest argument which may be advanced in defense of a future state. Day bases it on a hypothesis which he says the author of An Inquiry admits and calls "perfect theism," that everything in the universe is according to a good order, agreeable to the general interest, and perfectly contrived. If this much is true, then man must exist again; for an order of things without future existence is not the best order which we can imagine. Were it true that sin was punished with adequate pain and vir- tue rewarded with adequate pleasure in this life, then there would be no need of a future state to justify the order of things. But just the opposite state of affairs prevails in this life-a statement which hardly needs proving. Here Day is leading up to an expression of the hope which the patriarch Job, at the climax of his quest for an answer to the riddle of his suffering, strug- gled in vain to assert and to believe-tlhe hope that, since there is obviously no just dispensation of rewards and punishments in this life, there must be a future state in which good will be rewarded and evil punished. There is no positive proof in the Characteristics that Shaftesbury was ever aware of Day's comments, but it is highly probable that his spokesman, Theocles, in The Moralists, has Day in mind wlhen he alludes in 1709 to the reception of An Inquiry and "what offence was taken at it." 8 Theocles devotes several paragraphs to defending its author for his philosophical liberty in rea- soning "without the least show of zeal or passion, upon the subject of a Deity and a future state." The author is justified, Theocles asserts, because in ordinary theo- logical controversies, there is not much attention paid to men who are "loose in the very grounds and princi- ples of all religion"; yet these are the men who most need to be taken into consideration. Since these per- sons are not inclined to accept arguments from author- ity, it is necessary to convince them by an impartial and disinterested course of reasoning. This the author of An Inquiry had attempted by leaving his readers to draw their own conclusions from his principles, his primary aim being to reconcile them to virtue that they might be next drawn to religion by the removal of the greatest obstacles to it, those which arise from the vices and passions. Since his readers were not yet convinced of a god or a future state, he was forced to establish vir- tue on principles they would admit. After asserting that the only true service paid to God or to any superior proceeds from esteem or love, Theocles asks how such a principle can do harm to religion. He cannot see any detraction to a belief in after-rewards in conceding that the actions such a belief motivates are not equal to those 8 Robertson, 2: 50.</page><page sequence="12">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 19511 AN INQUIRY 307 which are voluntary and carried out with inclination. He finally defends the serving of God out of affection and love by the main principle of An Inquiry, that the wise and perfect order of the world proves the existence of a Supreme Mind, an object of love "the most amiable, the most engaging, and of the highest satisfaction and enjoyment." If this perfect order does exist, then there is no ill in the universe.9 The evidence seems to indicate that Shaftesbury had read Day's critique, for he has Theocles admit Day's argument that the existence of a future state justifies ill in the world since "he needs not be over and above solicitous as to the fate of virtue in this world who is secure of hereafter." 10 Theocles' reservations show, however, that Shaftesbury is more inclined to challenge than to submit to his adversary. The vindication of providence by a future state, continues Theocles, is valid only to Christians, who already have faith. Scep- tics and inquirers who have no faith must seek provi- dence in this world, and the "aggravation of the ap- pearing disorders in worldly affairs, and the blackest representation of society and human nature [Day's method of argument], will hardly help them to this view." Before they will accept the notion of a future state, they must be convinced of order and justice in the present world, that virtue is "to itself no small re- ward, and vice in a great measure its own punishment." In conclusion, Theocles charges that by "building a future state on the ruins of virtue, religion in general, and the cause of a deity is betrayed; and by making re- wards and punishments the principal motives to duty, the Christian religion in particular is overthrown, and its greatest principle, that of love, rejected and ex- posed." If Day ever read this vindication of Shaftes- bury's principles, the idea of a retaliatory paraphrase may have come to him as it came several years later to Mandeville, who effectively turned many pious minds 9 These arguments would serve equally well to defend Hoad- ly's tracts against Atterbury, for Hoadly and Shaftesbury thought along almost identical lines in regard to the moral order of the universe. According to Hoadly, "The chief Hap- piness of any Being, in whatsoever state it is, or of what Dura- tion soever its Life is; must result from the most excellent Parts of its Constitution: that the Happiness of a Being, made capable of imitating God, tho' never so short a time, must con- sist in that Imitation; that Virtue is the Imitation of God, and therefore must be the Happiness of Man: That the chief Hap- piness of a reasonable Creature must consist in living as Rea- son directs, whether he lives one Day, or to Eternity." A letter to the Reverend Dr. Francis Atterbury (London, 1706). Hoadly may have been indebted in part to Shaftesbury for these opin- ions, published midway between An Inquiry and the Character- istics, but it is doubtful because of the limited circulation of the original version of Shaftesbury's treatise. It is an attractive theory, however, to assume Shaftesbury's influence and to re- gard as a payment of the debt, two articles in The London Jour- nal (Nos. 676-677), June 10 and 17, 1732, defending Shaftesbury against the attack of Berkeley in his Alciphron. These articles are attributed to Hoadly by Joseph Warton in a note concern- ing Pope. William Lisle Bowles, ed., The works of Alexander Pope 5: 314, London, 1806. 10 Robertson, 2: 57. against the Characteristics by speaking of Shaftesbury's "design of establishing heathen virtue on the ruins of Christianity." The argument concerning future rewards had been waged among the theologians in France as in England, the most famous disputants being Fenelon and Bossuet. It was then removed to a broader plane of interest by Shaftesbury's friend and fellow advocate of philosophi- cal liberty, Pierre Bayle. In his Pense'es Diverses sur la Comete, Bayle states the theological arguments gen- erally used to vindicate the doctrine of future rewards and refutes them with arguments drawn from psycho- logical observation. He admits that theoretically the doctrine should be powerful enough to move Christians, but insists that actually it does not, for men's opinions and their actions are not consistent. Passion and tem- perament master their religious principles, and conse- quently they choose a present reality instead of a re- moter promise. Somewhat cynically, Bayle argues that men do not live according to their principles; in a strug- gle between that which reason declares to be right and that which passion desires, passion is generally victor. All religious and national groups, pagan and heathen, with diverse moral opinions of varying degrees of aus- terity, give in to the same passions, which in their judg- ment are sinful. Bayle joins Shaftesbury in asserting the sufficiency of reason as a motive to virtue. Indeed, Bayle's remarks answer Day's strongest argument, the analogy from rewards and punishments in civil life. According to Bayle, reason had dictated to the ancient sages that it is necessary to do good for the love of good itself and that virtue should divorce itself from thought of recompense, for only an evil man would abstain from evil out of fear of punishment." In this passage, which is somewhat inconsistent with his previous declaration that passion generally gains the victory over reason, Bayle seems to have descended to "a pitch above the third heaven," a pinnacle of sublimity usually associated more with Shaftesbury than with the author of the Dic- tionary. There are even stronger links between Bayle and Shaftesbury. In purpose and form, Bayle's Pensees is much like Shaftesbury's A Letter concerning Enthusi- asmn. Both were occasioned by historical incidents, the appearance of the comet of 1680 and of the French prophets respectively; both are in the form of a letter to a friend; and both teach that enlightened scepticism or even atheism is preferable to bigoted credulousness. The latter principle is fundamental also to An Inquiry concerning Virtue. Shaftesbury's correspondence with Bayle was begun in 1699, and there is little doubt that he was familiar at that time with the Pensees and with the first edition of Bayle's dictionary, 1697. In 1701, when Desmaizeaux was translating An Inquiry at Shaftesbury's desire, Shaftesbury was eager to have Desmaizeaux' work sent as a present to Bayle.'2 "1 Pensees, Sec. 178. 12 Rand ed., op. cit., 307.</page><page sequence="13">308 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Bayle is perhaps best known for his principle, re- peated by Shaftesbury, that a community of atheists may observe high principles of morality, immeasurably higher than those of a group of religious zealots, but it cannot be ascribed, even in its post-classical form, exclusively to the paternity of Bayle. In Bacon's essay "Of Superstition" we are told that times inclined to atheism are civil times, but superstition ravishes all the spheres of government. Bayle carries on the proof from every conceivable point of view, demonstrating by de- duction, analogy and history that the morals of a relig- ionless society would be adequately regulated by a code of honor and decency. Bayle's ostensible purpose is to convince his country- men that the appearance of comets or other natural wonders has no religious significance, for these pre- tended miracles may be used as effectively to prove the existence of false gods as of the true. This provides him opportunity to analyze the social and moral influ- ence of all forms of religious belief, pagan and Christian. He argues that atheism does not necessarily lead to im- morality, that those with high religious beliefs do not act in accordance with them, that many of the most wicked men on earth have been noted for their piety, that virtuous conduct is a result of human law rather than religious faith, and that there is no connection be- tween human destiny and such prodigies as comets. To support the contention that religion is no guarantor of morals, Bayle asserts that religion calls for superficial observances rather than moral perfection. Jews, for example, would ostracize one of their number for not having a child circumcized, but not for calumny, deceit or adultery. In fasting and similar observances, the devotee finds either some compensation for his denial or some casuistical loophole for avoiding it. Religion is not allowed to interfere with the ruling passion.13 Instead of promoting virtue, religious zeal may do just the opposite, for zealots believe they will be forgiven their vices and evil deeds on the strength of their fanati- cal devotion to external acts of religion.'4 Wicked and vicious people, Bayle maintains, are often the most re- ligious and credulous. He gives as example Louis XI, a cruel tyrant and confirmed believer in the efficacy of prayer.15 People in high court circles are thus not as a consequence of their high position less likely than their subjects to accept superstition and vulgar errors. Bayle is not maintaining that believers are necessarily any worse than atheists. To him belief and unbelief merely have nothing to do with virtue. Either to convince or to bait the very pious, he points out that the devils and mortals in league with devils, all believe in God, but are still evil. Indeed, their belief makes their evil more culpable than if they were atheists. Bayle is, perhaps humorously, using a priori metaphysical reasoning to 3 Pensees, Sec. 137. 14 Sec. 144. 15 Sec. 152. demonstrate that which lhe l)elieves to be a matter of common observation. Because of this doctrine, Bavle was condemned by William Law as the principal author among those who seek to "expose virtue and religion as being only the blind effects of complexion, natural temper and cus- tom." 16 This doctrine that morality springs from so- cial custom, a doctrine in general conforming with the theories of Hobbes, Locke and Mandeville, represents the antithesis of Shaftesbury's system. According to Law, Bayle was forced to assert that religious opinions and beliefs had no influence at all upon men's actions in order to maintain that a society of atheists could be as virtuous as a society of people professing religion, for if religious opinions or beliefs were allowed to have any influence upon conduct, then it must also be allowed that a society of atheists must be less virtuous than a society of believers. Shaftesbury follows Bayle in affirming that a society of atheists may be virtuous, but parts company by bas- ing his proof on the opposite assumption that opinion and belief do influence conduct. His indirect vindica- tion of atheists is part of hiis discussion of the forces which react upon a principle of virtue in a rational crea- ture. The first half of At Inquiry is devoted to the relationship between religion and virtue, a subject like- wise occupying almost half of Bayle's Pensees. Fol- lowing Bayle, Shaftesbury points out in his introduction that many religious zealots are extremely degenerate and that many considered to be atheists have conducted themselves in a virtuous and upright manner. Then he proceeds toward his definition of virtue, which like his whole moral system is based upon individual affection.'7 It is by affection only, he teaches, that a creature is esteemed good or ill, natural or unnatural. Virtue con- sists in the affections being directed toward that which reason teaches is good. This introduction of reason as a force equally important as affection leads to a twofold "difficulty in the case," one of which Shaftesbury recog- nized and attempted to clear up. The other, which rests upon a difficult distinction between errors in fact and errors in opinion, still represents a logical flaw in his system. Affections may be directed toward the public welfare, but the action which they cause may be harm- ful. Even affections and reason together may produce a harmful action, for example, "a dutiful son aiming at an enemy, but by mistake or ill chance happening to kill his father." The result is harmful, Shaftesbury says, but the action is not wrong. In the same manner, harm- ful deeds caused by weaknesses or imperfections in the senses cannot be termed wrong. Yet Shaftesbury is forced to place some limitations on the excusing of hu- man error. He therefore denies that wrong opinion may be offered as excuse. In some countries monkeys, cats and crocodiles have been worshipped as deities, but to preserve the life of one of these creatures at the ex- 16 Remarks upont ...

Thus evil done because of false opinion or belief, although with good intentions, is evil still. Shaftesbury makes here a dis- tinction between a mistake in fact, which, because no sign of ill affection, can be no cause of vice, and a mis- take in right, which is the cause of unequal affection and consequently of vicious action. This distinction is ex- tremely tenuous even with Shaftesbury's additional comment that a slight mistake will not destroy the character of a virtuous man, but gross or frequent mis- takes through superstition or ill custom will do so. Deciding whether the wrong action in almost any given case be the result of error in fact or in belief would re- quire the utmost ingenuity of casuistry, a talent which Shaftesbury elsewhere vigorously condemns, and even then the decision would be disputable. Are vicious deeds based upon theories of racial supremacy, for ex- ample, errors in fact or in belief ? The second difficulty is one inherent in all systems recognizing both salutary and harmful impulses in the individual. We call the salutary impulses virtuous and measure one man's virtue by the extent of these im- pulses. Yet we feel that another man who has strong harmful impulses which he is able to restrain has even greater virtue. Virtue in one sense seems to rest solely in the good affections, but in another sense seems to depend on the presence of both good and bad. In Aris- totelian terms, which has more virtue, the temperate man who never has extravagant or wrong desires, or the continent man who has wrong desires and masters them? It would seem that the man who has no ill pas- sions has less of a virtuous principle than the man whose good affections master the ill. Some critics of Shaftes- bury, unimpressed by the high decorum of his personal life, accused him of being like the temperate man, in Shaftesbury's phrase, "cheaply virtuous." The "diffi- culty in the case," Shaftesbury resolves by asserting that the man with controlled evil affections becomes in- creasingly more virtuous, not less, in proportion as he gains the victory over their influence. This leads to the principle that vice and virtue are variously mixed among mankind, that there are very few men who are completely vicious or corrupt. Passing from a consideration of the nature of virtue to the forces which have the power to exclude virtue in the individual, Shaftesbury comes to the treatment of the sociological influence of atheism. There are, according to his outline, three hypothetical forces which work against virtue, namely, that which (1) takes away the natural sense of right and wrong, or (2) creates a wrong sense of it, or (3) causes the right sense to be, opposed by contrary affections. The natural sense of right and wrong itself, by which is meant not only a discernment of the good or ill of one's species-but a desire to obtain one and avoid the other-is the basis of Shaftesbury's ethics, introduced, as we see, early in his literary career. Since this sense is a first principle in our constitution and as natural to us as natural affec- tion itself, Shaftesbury declares, "there is no specu- lative opinion, persuasion, or belief, which is capable immediately or directly to exclude or destroy it." 18 Neither religion nor atheism, therefore, Shaftesbury concludes, may have any influence on this natural sense except perhaps indirectly by the creating of contrary affections. The moral nature of man supersedes relig- ion itself. The second force, the wrong sense or false imagina- tion of right and wrong, proceeds only from custom and education in opposition to nature. To eat the flesh of one's enemy is against both the stomach and the moral sense, but custom may convince certain men that it is right and honorable.19 Here, by the way, is Shaftesbury's own answer to the chief objection made throughout the century to his doctrine of moral sense, the objection that moral standards differ radically from one group to the next. Atheism, Shaftesbury says, has no direct effect in setting up a false sense of right and wrong although habitual licentiousness mav eventually cause a loss of moral sense. Corrupt religion, however, may have an extremely pernicious effect in corrupting the moral sense. If superstition and false religion advance any- thing which is in its nature odious and abominable as being the will of a supreme deity, they teach a love and admiration of that ill. It is surprising that Shaftes- bury's implication that Christianity is guilty of this evil, one of the few reflections on Christianity in. An Inquiry, was not noticed by Day. If there be a religion which teaches the adoration and love of a God whose character it is to be captious and of high resentment, subject to wrath and anger, furious, revengeful, and revenging himself, when offended, on others than those who gave the offence; and if there be added to the character of this God a fraudulent disposition, encouraging deceit and treachery amongst men, favourable to a few, though for slight causes, and cruel to the rest, 'tis evident that such a religion as this being strongly enforced must of necessity raise even an approbation and respect toward the vices of this kind, and breed a suitable disposition, a capricious, partial, revengeful, and deceitful temper.20 The belief in a God who, on the other hand, is in all representations "a true model and example of the most exact justice, and highest goodness and worth" will in- evitably cause a like principle and affection in human conduct. Thus, in regard to corrupting moral sense, religion "is capable of doing great good or harm; and atheism nothing positive in either way." If we believe that God is just and good, Shaftesbury declares, we must suppose that "there is independently such a thing as justice and injustice, truth and false- hood, right and wrong," according to which we pro- nounce him just, righteous, and true. "If the mere will, decree, or law of God be said absolutely to consti- 18Ibid. 1: 260. 19Ibid. 1: 261. 20Ibid. 1: 263.

SOC. tute right and wrong, then are these latter words of no significancy at all." Shaftesbury's asserting the independent existence of moral principles against the basing moral distinctions entirely upon the will of God is generally thought to be a reflection upon Locke, who held the latter view.21 The problem had been discussed by scores of writers in the seventeenth century, Culver- wel also holding the will of God theory, and Cudworth, the independent existence theory.22 A host of moralists in the eighteenth century carried on the controversy. The final force working against virtue consists of "the opposition made by other affections to the natural sense of right and wrong," a sense antecedent to reason and to religious belief. Shaftesbury recognizes two motives of obedience to a Supreme Being, awe of his power, "presupposing some disadvantage or benefit to accrue from him," or admiration of his excellence and worth, "thinking it the perfection of nature to imitate and re- semble him." In the first motive, Shaftesbury declares, there is no virtue or goodness whatsoever, merely servil- ity. In the second, however, when God is reverenced as worthy and good, and esteemed for an affection of benevolence and love towards the whole, this example together with the feeling of the superintendency of a divine presence will raise and increase the affection to- wards virtue. In discussing the evil which religion may cause by stimulating affections of self-love, Shaftesbury uses the doctrine of future rewards and punishments to show that only religion may cause the right sense to be opposed by contrary affections. Atheism is still with- out influence on individual conduct, for the advantages of virtue may be recognized without belief in God. This far, Shaftesbury goes with Bayle. He gives the argu- ment a contrary turn, however, by stressing the positive side of religion, the belief in a completely benevolent God, and showing the advantages to virtue of a theisti- cal belief above the atheistical. These consist in giving the individual an increased sense of slhame in evil ac- tions, a sense of honor in lnoble actions, and a sense of goodness and beauty in the entire universe, as well as in reconciling him to hardships because of his faith that the world order is in the main just and good, a faith which enables him to suffer hardships for virtue's sake. With this, Shaftesbury comes to the conclusion of the firstl half of An Inquiry, that "the perfection and height of virtue must be owing to the belief of a god." The three important elements in Book I are the vin- dication of a society of atheists, a view presumably in- fluenced by Bayle, the protest against the orthodox doc- trine of rewards and punishments in a future state, a protest with which not many clergymen had been in sympathy, and the doctrine of the benevolent affections, an opinion widely held by divines of all types, Platonists, 21 Essay concerning hunvan understanding, Bk. I, Chap. III, Sec. 6. 22 Nathanael Culverwel, The light of nature, Chap. V, Lon- don, 1654; Ralph Cudworth, Eternal and immutable morality 1: ii, 2, London, 1731. latitudinarians and the orthodox. The latter doctrine, which is the foundation of humanistic deism, is devel- oped in Book II as the central theme combined with the proof, to offset the proponents of a future state, that virtue works to man's interest in this life. Although Book II is longer than Book I, its only element of originality apart from the theory of benevo- lent affections carried over from Book I is a classifica- tion of the passions. There is some novelty in proving that the natural or benevolent affections, the first class, may exist to excess, but proving the excess of the other two classes, the selfish passions and the unnatural pas- sions (by definition harmful), to be against an indi- vidual's interest has occupied moralists throughout the history of letters. There are few dissenters except pos- sibly the propounders of paradoxes, and even Mande- ville did not maintain that private vices are private benefits. In presenting his doctrine of the benevolent affec- tions, Shaftesbury refutes the moral and social philoso- phy of Thomas Hobbes. Among the many doctrines upheld by Hobbes in his Leviathan, Shaftesbury was particularly opposed to those stating that all social rela- tions are based on fear, that the natural condition of man is a state of war, and that the dominant passions are selfish. An understanding of Shaftesbury's inter- pretation of Hobbes can best be obtained from his owI statement in his "Preface" to Select Sermons of Dr. Whichlcote (London, 1698). This is he, who reckoning up the passions or affections by which men are held together in society, live in peace, or have any correspondence one with another, forgot to men- tion kindness, friendship, sociableness, love of company and converse, natural affection, or any thing of this kind; I say forgot, because I can scarcely think so ill of any man, as that he has not by experience found any of these affections in himself, and consequently, that he believes none of them to be in others. But in the place of other affections, or good inclinations, of whatever kind, this author has substi- tuted only one master-passion, fear, which has in effect, devour'd all the rest, and left room only for that infinite passion towards power after power, natural (as he affirms) to all men, and never ceasing but in death. So much less good nature has he left with mankind, than what he allows the worst of beasts. The view that all social relations are based upon fear and upon a struggle for power leads in Hobbes' reason- ing to the principle that the natural condition of man is a state of war. He asserts that "men have no pleas- ure, (but on the contrary a great deale of griefe) in keeping company, where there is no power able to over- awe them all." Out of the three principal causes of quarrels, competition, diffidence, and glory, he reaches the conclusion "that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called Warre; and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man." 23 The politi- cal state is formed, as every casual reacler of Hobbes 23 Leviathan, Chap. 13.</page><page sequence="16">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 1951] AN INQUIRY 311 knows, as the visible power to restrain the natural pas- sions from leading men to constant warfare. "For the Lawes of Nature," he affirms, "(as Justice, Equity, Modesty, Mercy, and (in summe) doing to others, as wee would be done to,) of themselves, without the ter- rour of some Power, to cause them to be observed, are contrary to our naturall Passions, that carry us to Par- tiality, Pride, Revenge, and the like." 24 This leads to the inevitable conclusion, to which Hobbes' fame is primarily due, that man's passions are entirely selfish. There are other doctrines of Hobbes to which Shaftes- bury objects in other parts of the Characteristics, to be considered in a subsequent chapter, but An Inquiry is concerned with Hobbes mainly in proving the existence and effective strength of benevolent affections. To prove his point, Shaftesbury was forced to combat another body of opinion, one on the side of religion and as strongly anti-Hobbes as Shaftesbury himself. Many of the opponents of Hobbes, Shaftesbury explains in his "Preface" to Whichcote, were afraid to advance the principle of good nature lest the need of sacred revela- tion be taken away. "So that they were forced in a manner, to wound virtue and give way to the imputa- tion of being mercenary, and of acting in a slavish spirit, in the ways of religion, rather than admit a sort of rival (in their sense) to the faith of divine revelation." The atheists, fearing that the acknowledgment of moral and social principles would prove the existence of God, and certain divines, fearing that the same admission would prejudice revelation, both, to use Shaftesbury's phrase, made war on virtue itself. The prevalence of the theo- logical doctrine of rewards and punishments, Shaftes- bury ascribes to the influence of Hobbesian principles, on the theory that without them there would have been less heard "of terror and punishmt1eent; and more of mnoral rectitude and good niature." There is very little new to be said about the sources of Shaftesbury's views of benevolence and natural af- fections. That they existed widely among the Cam- bridge Platonists and others before Shaftesbury and that Shaftesbury was familiar with literary expressions of the views is beyond doubt. The background has been sufficiently explored by Professor R. S. Crane, and there would be little value in citing representative pas- sages from sermons, discourses and miscellaneous works which show similar ideas and parallel expressions.25 Shaftesbury's primary contribution consisted in dem- onstrating the existence of a divine being by the doc- trine of natural affections and hence establishing hu- manistic deism. We must take issue with his implication in the "Pref- ace" to Whichcote's sermons, however, that divines had neglected to use moral arguments in the refuting of Hobbes, for the doctrines of natural benevolence and of 24 Leviathan, Chap. 17. 25 Suggestions toward a genealogy of the man of feeling, E.

Quart. 11: 204-205, 1932. a light of nature obliging the performance of actions promoting the public good had been given formal pres- entation by Richard Cumberland in A Treatise of the Laws of Nature, a work designed specifically to confute Hobbes wholly within the bounds of philosophy without the introduction of theological disputes.26 In the fifth chapter, "Of the Law of Nature, and Its Obligation," Shaftesbury's basic principle that virtue is the good and vice the ill of every man is demonstrated in even greater detail than Shaftesbury attempts to expound it. Cum- berland shows that the practice of virtue brings as its results fuller knowledge of God and men (the most no- ble cause of happiness, public and private), conformity of our nature with the divine nature, and the dominion of our reason over passions and all voluntary motions; the consequent joy and tranquility from an inward sense of piety and justice represent the principal reward of virtue; the practice of vice, on the other hand, causes great anxiety of mind through conscience, fear of ven- geance both human and divine, sense of the malice and envy of others, and a sense of merited punishment. Shaftesbury's chief divergence from this scheme con- sists in regarding these conditions as effects of either natural or personal affections rather than as the rewards and punishments of virtuous and vicious conduct. As Shaftesbury expresses the problem, the difficulty concerns the existence of two separate sets of affections, those directed towards the common nature or species, that is, compassion, mutual succor and love of fellow- ship, company, family and friends, and those directed toward the private nature or self system. The follow- ers of Hobbes, Shaftesbury charges, assumed that the two sets of affections are in opposition and that the private interest demands the abolishment of the social affections. Shaftesbury proposes to show that "what men represent as an ill order and constitution in the universe, by making moral rectitude appear the ill, and depravity the good or advantage of a creature, is in na- ture just the contrary." Here Shaftesbury is using a forensic trick, bordering on misrepresentation, by sug- gesting that in the Hobbesian scheme, moral rectitude is necessarily associated with self-ill and depravity with self-advantage. Hobbes had indeed asserted the preva- lence of the self-affections, but he had not suggested, nor need he admit, that they are necessarily vicious. It is true enough, however, that Hobbes's system is quite remote from the main principle of Shaftesbury's system, that virtue is the advantage and vice, the disadvantage of every creature. Shaftesbury first appeals to the universal assent that men who are wholly devoid of natural affection and a social principle find little satisfaction in sensual pleas- ure and are usually morose, malignant and miserable. But, he continues, this assent exists only with regard to absolute immorality or complete degeneracy, and many 26 Cumberland's treatise was written in Latin and published in 1672 as De Legibus Naturae Disquisitio Philosophica. It was translated by John Maxwell in 1724.</page><page sequence="17">312 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. believe that to be immoral and inhuman "in a little de- gree, should be no misery nor harm at all." Shaftes- bury proposes to show that this is an illogical and in- coherent manner of thinking by demonstrating that the system of the affections is as orderly and symmetrical as that of the body, and that whoever removes a good affection or introduces an ill one by acting in prejudice of his integrity, good nature or worth, is as cruel toward himself as though he were deliberately mangling the physical parts of his body. Shaftesbury affirms that all actions are motivated by the passions or affections, which consist of three groups, the natural affections, which lead to public good; the self-affections, which lead to only private good; and the unnatural affections, which lead to neither public nor private good, but the opposite. The latter type are wholly vicious, but the two former may be either vicious or virtuous according to their degree. Public affection may be too high, for example, when pity is so overwhelming that it prevents extending the succor required, and private affection may be too weak when insensibility to danger leads to loss of life. There are in every species, according to this theory, natural and self affections in just the proper number and degree, when in balance, to secure its sur- vival and prosperity. Extreme timorousness may be according to the economy of those animals with no pro- vision for defense, and courage contrary to it. Courage, on the other hand, is essential to the economy of de- fensively-armed animals. The proper balance of the affections is comparable to the harmonious tuning of the strings in a musical instrument, and the different species are comparable to different instruments. Men differ from each other more than do other species, Shaftesbury continues, because man lives less in accord with nature than do other species "and by means of religion itself is often rendered the more barbarous and inhuman." The unbalance of the affections is vice. Vice exists when either the public affections are weak or deficient, or the private affections are too strong, or other affections arise which support neither the public nor private system. To prove his case against Hobbes, Shaftesbury needs to show that none of these three con- ditions is advantageous to the individual. The first proof, concerning the natural or public af- fections, rests on the premise that the pleasures of mind are greater than those of body and that mental enjoy- ments are either the actual operation of the natural af- fections or their effects. The expressions of counte- nance and other outward marks, Shaftesbury offers as self-evident proof of the superiority of social pleasures to any others. The features reflect a more intense and undisturbed joy from social pleasures than from the satisfaction of hunger, thirst or similar appetites. A further example is the exercise of the mind in the dis- covery of speculative truths, "a natural joy in the con- templation of those numbers, that harmony, proportion, and concord, which supports the universal nature."' Even this speculative pleasure is surpassed by the ex- ercise of benignity and goodness, the contemplation "of a beautiful, proportioned, and becoming action." Even the melancholy aspect of virtue, the carrying on of the tender affections through fears, horrors and griefs is pleasurable. Moving the passions in this mournful way holds greater enjoyment than anything in the way of "sense and common appetite." The foregoing mental enjoyments are the natural affections themselves, but pleasure may also proceed as the result of natural affec- tions through sympathy, the participation in the delight of others, and through the consciousness of the love, merited esteem or approbation of others. Shaftesbury goes so far as to say that nine-tenths of the pleasure in life is derived from these two sources. For clarity, he restates the argument in terms of an easy temper and a quiet mind, both of which depend upon the natural and good affections. All human be- ings, even those enjoying the greatest degree of out- ward prosperity, are subject to crosses, indispositions and inconveniences, which will breed ill humor unless they are suppressed by kind affections. Religious de- votion may serve as a remedy only when it is "of the pleasant and cheerful sort," which is in itself natural affection, for if it is of the harsh and dismal sort, it will aggravate the ill temper. Peace of mind also rests upon the kind affections, for each man reviews in his mind his desires and actions, and every man who does ill, realizing through his conscience that he deserves ill, suffers mental anguish. After a treatment of various phases of conscience, Shaftesbury proceeds to demon- strate that even the pleasure of the body and the satis- factions of sense depend upon the natural affections. This he does by showing that neither the crudest de- bauchery nor the most exquisite pleasure produces sat- isfaction in the absence of fellowship or company. Shaftesbury concludes the discussion of natural affec- tions by describing their part in the balance of affections and the consequence to the individual of their deficiency. Nature has so ordered it among animals and human be- ings that their passions flourish in relation to the type of existence they lead. Animals which in a wild state expend all their passions in seeking a livelihood, if placed in circumstances richly catering to all their needs, would find their temper and passions grown out of pro- portion. Their easy life would be attained at the ex- pense of the natural good disposition and orderliness of the species. In raising the argument to the human level, Shaftesbury strikes at luxury in metropolitan centers, a condition later to be unconscionably justified by Man- deville. Mankind also requires honest employment, Shaftesbury affirms, and in luxurious cities "where numbers of men are maintained in lazy opulence and wanton plenty," unnatural vices increase.27 Where there is no healthy and natural exercise, that which is unnatural and vicious will be substituted. Reverting to the parallel between the external body and the in- 27 Robertson, 1: 313.</page><page sequence="18">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 19511 AN INQUIRY 313 ward constitution, Shaftesbury asserts that the inward part must also be exercised and that no exercise is "so essential as that of social or natural affection." With- out orderly and natural affection, "new and unnatural must be raised, and all inward order and economy de- stroyed." The delicate arrangement of the moral struc- ture requires an exact balance of the affections. Man's natural affections prompt him to the good and interest of his species and community, and he of all creatures is least able to bear solitude, a condition which makes him either morose and ill-natured, if a result of choice, or discontented, if a result of compulsion. In undertaking to prove his next point, that "by having the self-passions too intense or strong, a crea- ture becomes miserable," Shaftesbury first of all lists some of these passions, love of life, resentment of in- jury, appetite towards nourishment and towards the means of generation, love of praise, and love of ease. Since love of life is basic and, therefore, the one prin- ciple that might be considered to overbalance the natu- ral affections in securing the happiness of a creature, Shaftesbury tries to show at the outset that even this passion may be against an individual's interest. He does this by asserting that life itself may sometimes be a misfortune as in sickness and infirmity, the creature's interest being better served in not prolonging it, and that a disproportionate love of life may furthermore lose its own object, for example, when manifested as fear, if courage is the quality needed to preserve life. Even if life be spared as the result of cowardice, the price may be too great because of mental turmoil caused by constant fears which continue to operate and by the consciousness of having committed base and mean ac- tions. Anger, a passion of an opposite nature, is much more serviceable in preserving an individual from harm and is plainly one of the passions tending toward the advantage of the self-system. Yet the ravages of the excess of this passion and its attendant, revenge, pro- duce such ill effects on mind, body and circumstances of life that misery is the inevitable consequence. The rest of this section consists in an analysis of other self-affections, luxury, sexual love, economic interest, emulation or love of praise and love of rest. It is not necessary to trace Shaftesbury's proof that in modera- tion these passions serve the interest of the individual, but in excess, when they become riot, debauchery, ava- rice, pride or ambition, and sloth, they grow contrary to real interest. Their worst effect, Shaftesbury con- cludes, is in creating a sordid disposition of selfishness and causing the suppression of the natural affections. They are "the certain means of losing us the chief en- joyment of life, and raising in us those horrid and un- natural passions, and that savageness of temper, which makes the greatest of miseries, and the most wretched state of life." This group of passions consists of the unnatural affec- tions, the third in Shaftesbury's scheme, those which lead neither to public nor to private good. Since by definition they are wholly vicious, Shaftesbury does not have much difficulty in proving them contrary to self- interest. These unnatural passions include inhuman delight in viewing torments, petulancy, malice, malig- nity, envy, moroseness, misanthropy, superstition and unnatural lusts. Shaftesbury makes a supplementary class of affections which may have some tendency to- ward private good, but are so exorbitant and abhorrent to natural affection that they should be deemed un- natural. These include enormous pride or ambition, arrogance, tyranny, extreme anger and revenge, in- veteracy and rancor. Finally, he adds treachery and ingratitude, which are strictly "mere negative vices" and not passions, having neither aversion nor desire, but are derived from "the defect, unsoundness, or cor- ruption of the affections in general." The possible ob- jection that no matter how unnatural these passions may be, they do carry with them some kind of pleasure and satisfaction, Shaftesbury answers by comparing them to physical pains, which produce pleasure during intervals of assuagement. It is in this sense that they are "negative vices." The natural condition of ani- mosity, hatred or cruelty is likewise misery and torment, which gives place to merely temporary pleasure as the passions are momentarily satisfied or appeased. After a listing of the unnatural passions, Shaftes- bury's rhetorical description of their relation to indi- vidual advantage is somewhat superfluous. The man beset with these affections, he asserts, has cut himself off from the rest of nature, and conscious of the mer- ited ill will of every human soul, feels continual fear, melancholy and despair. In his formal conclusion, Shaftesbury asserts that no one can be wicked or vicious except by the deficiency of natural affections, the excess of the selfish, or the mere presence of the unnatural. Each of these conditions brings misery and ill to the individual, but their op- posite brings happiness and good. Referring to his scheme as "moral arithmetic," Shaftesbury places the obligation to virtue in attaining the greatest self-good by means of a just balance or economy of the passions. The parallel to be developed in The Moralists between "the united structure and fabric of the mind, and of those passions which constitute the temper, or soul" and the order of the universe in which each individual continues useful to himself as he is useful to society is suggested in the final passage. Virtue, "that single quality, thus beneficial to all society, and to mankind in general, is found equally a happiness and a good to each creature in particular; and is that by which alone man can be happy, and without which he must be miserable." Shaftesbury's term "moral arithmetic," which he uses to describe his method of weighing the affections ac- cording to their efficacy in producing happiness, sug- gests that man should compute the consequences of his actions mainly in terms of greatest self-interest and thus seems to conflict with his emphasis on the natural</page><page sequence="19">314 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. affections and with his protest against mercenary mo- rality. The apparent inconsistency inherent in a sys- tem based on the benevolent affections which neverthe- less seeks to ground morality on seeking the greatest self-good was faced earlier by Cumberland, who, after proving that "those human actions which promote the publick good, obtain the greatest advantages for their reward" had asserted that "every one uses the best method in his power, to procure his own happiness (which is part of the publick happiness) who constantly promotes the common good" and that it is necessary "that he should thus act, if he would use his utmost endeavours to make himself happy." The objection Cumberland foresaw was that his method of deducing the laws of nature subordinates the common good (and consequently the honor of God and happiness of all other men) to the happiness of every particular person. Cumberland answered that his systenm teaches just the opposite, that the rational pursuit of an individual's own happiness obliges him to pursue the common good and the honor of God and that the primary end of God and of the individual who fulfills the law of nature, which is public good, is far greater than the sanction of that law, individual happiness.28 The translator and editor of the 1727 edition, John Maxwell, in a note presents a further repudiation of "this objection against our author and some other moralists," among whom he may be in- cluding Shaftesbury. Maxwell admits that "no action can be called virtuous, so far as the agent is excited to it by private interest, or self-love," but affirms that it is "plainly impossible for any moralists to set other motives to action before men, but these from self-love." Although benevolence is really natural to all men, it does not always incite men to action based on common good because "upon some false views they imagine their private interest would be oppos'd by it." Echoing the primary purpose of Ani Inquiry, Maxwell suggests, "Re- move these false views, and benevolence, when the seem- ing Obstacle is remov'd, must influence men." To a further objection to Cumberland's scheme which would apply equally to Shaftesbury's, that "the force of moral obligation consists in rewards and punishments," Max- well replies that the force of moral obligation consists in love of the deity and our fellowmen as well as re- wards and punishments. The truth is, he asserts, that both benevolence and self-love oblige, "sometimes each operating singly, but, for the most part, both jointly concurring in exerting their power, with regard to the action." This is the best explanation, if one is needed, of the apparent inconsistency of Shaftesbury's denunci- ation of the view to rewards and punishments in Book I and his analysis of the self-profit of virtue in Book II. Shaftesbury recognized that it is impossible to dispense with self-interest altogether, but he was firmly con- vinced that benevolent affections operate concurrently. Thus he objected to Hobbes and certain divines who 28 A treatise of the laws of niature, 270-275. founded their schemes of virtue exclusively on self- interest. Maxwell disposes of one more possible objec- tion to Cumberland's scheme, that according to it, "the principle of self-love is more strong and uniform than that of benevolence." Maxwell asserts that there is nothing in Cumberland's system to raise one principle above the other (an observation which would probably hold true of Shaftesbury's system as well), but that he personally believes that most people desire their own advantage more than that of others and that such a de- sire is not inconsistent with virtue. \Ve remember that according to both Cumberland and Shaftesbury, "true self-interest" consists in the exercise of the benevolent affections. Maxwell adds that he believes there are some people "of so exalted and generous a disposition, as to entertain as great, nay, a greater, desire of the general good of mankind, than of any private advan- tage." This became the opinion of Shaftesbury's dis- ciple, Francis Hutcheson, who going much further than Shaftesbury in insisting upon the absolute benevolence of actions to merit the claim of virtue, asserted that in an opposition between the desire for individual happi- ness and the happiness of all rational beings, the moral sense would demand the sacrifice of individual lhappiness to the happiness of the rational system. It is but a short step from this notion to Godwin's idea of political justice. III. ENTHUSIASM A Cicero, a Shaftsbury, a Bayle, How quick would they diminish in their sale? Four fifths of all their beauties who would heed, Had they not keen enthusiasts to read? -John Byrom, Enithutsiasmii: A Poctical Essay. Vast differences in style and purpose are revealed by the systematic presentation of philosophy in An Inquiry and the casual observations on a particular occasion in Shaftesbury's next literary venture, A Letter co)icern- ing Enthusiasm, 1708. The former received only negli- gible attention, but the latter was immediately attacked in three separate pamphlets, savagely condemned in Censura temporur, reviled in miscellaneous poems, ser- mons, and pamphlets over a period of several years, and publicly denounced in the House of Lords during the Sacheverell trial. Although Shaftesbury's letter, whichi he insists was first intended only as a private epistle, contains many of Shaftesbury's philosophical opinions, they appear for the most part in masquerade dress as incidental comments. The purpose of the letter, to ad- vocate that a spirit of tolerance and good, humor be adopted by the English toward a group of French prot- estant emigres claiming powers of prophecy, is socio- logical rather than philosophical. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, members of a religious sect known as Camizars or Camisards were being cruelly persecuted in their homeland, the persecution perhaps being responsible in part for the</page><page sequence="20">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 19511 ENTHUSIASM 315 frenzy of their religious observances. William du Serre, a native of the village Dieu-le-fit, had been the first to claim divine inspiration and the gift of prophecy in June, 1688. Before the end of the following Feb- ruary there had arisen in the district five or six hundred protestants of both sexes including a child of fifteen months "that gave out themselves to be Prophets, and inspir'd of the Holy Ghost." 1 In September, 1706, three of these prophets, Elias Marion, John Cavalier, and Durand Fage, arrived in London, where they forth- with began to display their prophetical talents. The ecstatic trances preceding the delivery of their inspira- tions, undoubtedly a source of their notoriety, were ac- companied with such physical and emotional violence that the prophets frequently fell prostrate upon the floor, rolled their eyes, twisted their lips, foamed at the mouth, heaved their breasts, and sometimes lay pros- trate in a trance. After brief periods of inertness, they would break out into a frenzy of contortions and convulsions, during which they would "quake, groan, laugh, belch, sigh, sing, shriek hideously; and at last, stretching their Mouths open, in a yawning, distorted, dreadful manner, in a doleful Tone, and as loud as they were able, would utter their Prophecies." 2 Since the prophets themselves were under the Spirit while proph- esying, it was necessary for scribes, of whom there were three, John Daude, Nicholas Facio, and Charles Por- tates, to write what was pronounced in their inspira- tions. Assuming everything uttered by the prophets to be divine, the scribes copied every word, referring to each other's notes to fill in chasms caused by rapid de- livery or faulty diction, and when this device failed, call- ing upon the Spirit to fill in the lacunae. There have been prophets and fanatics in all ages, and even the agitations, ecstasies, prophetical warnings, and miracles of the Camisards would probably have evoked little interest on the part of Shaftesbury or other Englishmen had the prophesying been confined to the Camisards. Polite society began to take notice, how- ever, when "two English Gentlemen of Quality and Estates, . . . from being at first only Auditors of the illiterate Camizars and pretended Prophets," learned to imitate and outdo them at their own arts. People in America would be aroused in much the same manner in our day if a famous industrialist and a congressman were to engage openly and persistently in evangelism on behalf of some emotional fanatic sect to which they announced themselves as converts. The two English- men, John Lacy and Sir Richard Bulkeley, both pub- lished vindications of the prophets, the former in A Cry froimi the Desart: or Testimonials of the Miraculous Things lately come to pass in the Cevennies, and, Warn- ings of the eternal spirit, both in 1707; the latter in An answer to several treatises lately published on the sub- icrt nf the Prnbhefs in 1708. Althoulh Lacy is not 1 [Richard Kingston] Etithusiastick Imiipostors no Divinely Inspir'd Prophets, 2, London, 1707. 2 Ibid., 3. named in any of Shaftesbury's works, he is described obliquely in A Letter concerning Enthusiasm as the gentleman who has "writ lately in defence of revived prophecy." Shaftesbury's letter also contains three quotations from A Cry from the Desart and a descrip- tion of Lacy himself in a prophetic trance. One of the most sensational London events of the cen- tury was the notorious promotion scheme on the part of the prophets to prove to their daily-expanding num- bers of converts and to a larger body of sceptics that they were actually possessed of miraculous powers. The test of their supernatural powers, a demonstration to be performed on one of their deceased adherents, Thomas Emes, consisted in no less than raising him fromn the grave. On his deathbed December 23, 1707, Emes had been assured by his fellow prophets that he would be miraculously resurrected, and a few weeks later the date on which the miracle would take place was announced in print. On the appointed day, May 25, 1708, a vast crowd gathered in the graveyard to view the modern miracle, a special detachment of sol- diers to hold back the crowd on hand at the express command of Queen Anne. According to some sources, Lacy, who had been appointed to perform the miracle, merely stayed away, and the crowd went home disap- pointed.3 According to other sources, the prophets prayed several hours over the grave, exhorting their former companion to arise, the crowd being amused at first by the ecstatic antics of the prophets, but enraged after several hours of unproductive trances and gyra- tions. Regardless of Lacy's presence or absence, Emes failed to burst his cerements and arise. Lacy had his excuses for the failure prepared well in advance. Some- time before the day of the test, Edmund Calamy, Lacy's former pastor, had promised that if Emes did arise again, he would join with the prophets, provided that, on the other hand, if Emes did not arise, Lacy would entirely quit the prophets. Lacy demurred, hesitated, and finally said "he did not know how far the infidelity of the present age might provoke God to deny so public an appearance, in a way of punishment." 4 In a vindi- cation published shortly after the failure, Lacy explained that raising the dead and similar miracles requiring great faith, prayer, and fasting are obstructed by the presence of a revengeful, defiant, adverse multitude, that prophetic periods are not always punctual, and, finally, that the prophets had been threatened beforehand with violence and thus declined to subject themselves to the malice of the mob. It has been suggested that Shaftesbury's reference to the claim of the new prophesying sect "among many other miracles, to have had a most signal one, acted pre- meditatedly, and with warning, before many hundreds of Deople. who actually give testimony to the truth ot 3James Sutherland, Background for Queen Anne, 36-74, Lon- don, Methuen &amp; Co., 1939. 4Edmund Calamy, An historical accouint of my ozwn life 2: 105, London, 1829.</page><page sequence="21">316 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. it," 5 is an allusion to the Emes episode, but this is doubtful, not only because Shaftesbury's reference im- plies a much greater success than attended the efforts to raise Emes, but also because the letter seems to have been composed before the attempt at resurrection. In a letter to Lord Somers, July 12, 1708, Shaftesbury states that a printer had a copy of the work left in his hands several months previously.6 The particular mir- acle Shaftesbury probably had in mind was the first miracle attempted concerning which the prophets gave advance notice and specified a place of meeting acces- sible to all.7 It concerned the person of a proselyte Elisabeth Grey, niece of a playhouse candle-snuffer, whose alleged promiscuous love-making with Lacy un- der the guidance of the spirit later caused great scandal. To Elisabeth it had been revealed that "there would arise in her Neck and Throat a hard Excresence of Flesh or rather of a bony substance, that would so ob- struct the Passage of her Breath, that it would cause her Neck to swell mightily, and even almost choak her." The rest of the miracle consisted in Lacy's re- moving the obstruction and preserving her from death. A large company of witnesses, both sceptical and credu- lous, assembled as part of Lacy's Sunday congregation. After one of the most inquisitive spectators discovered that the lump appeared only when Elisabeth's chin re- mained firm against her bosom and disappeared when her chin was forcibly lifted, the meeting was broken up with a furious argument between the prophets and their opponents over whether a miracle had really occurred. Whether or not Shaftesbury's letter was written be- fore the fiasco of the burying ground, the character of Lacy prominently figures in it. One may well wonder why Lacy, an Englishman of means, social position, and learning, should have become a convert to the Cami- sards. We learn from his preface to A Cry from the Desart that he first became impressed with their tidings of the speedy approach of the Kingdom of God; then after visiting the natives of Cevennes in London, he became satisfied of the truth of their accounts of divine inspiration. He accepted their revelations as authentic because of their bodily agitations, the moral rectitude of their conduct, and the conformity of their words to the doctrines of Scripture and the resemblance to Scrip- ture idiom. To us, as well as to many of Shaftesbury's contemporaries, these reasons may not seem convincing. Yet there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of Lacy's professions. As a gentleman of means, he obviously had no material end to gain by his stand, but actually suffered through the scorn and rudeness of the mob on several occasions. Not only such adherents as Lacy and Sir Richard Bulkeley, but also a bishop of the Church of England, expressed faith in the powers of the Camisards. Bishop Edward Fowler, ridiculed by "Robertson, 1: 31. 6 Rand, op. cit., 387. Rand says that A letter concerning en- thusiasm was sent to Somers under date of September, 1707. 7 Kingston, op. cit., 83. Shaftesbury for his belief in fairies, also credited the reality of the prophets' possession, holding it demoni- acal possession, however, rather than divine. To pro- nounce the prophets impostors or cheats, he writes in his Remarks on the Letter . . . concerning Enthusi- asm., is to pronounce them atheists, "and to declare our- selves as Uncharitable, as we judge them Impious, con- sidering what their Reputation has generally been to the time of their pretending to be Divinely Inspir'd." 8 Only possession, he says, could explain Lacy's speak- ing in Latin. Shaftesbury is just as charitable in his attitude toward the prophets and their English converts, never mention- ing Lacy by name but referring to him merely as a "gen- tleman who has writ lately in defence of revived proph- ecy." He quotes from Lacy's first reason in A Cry from the Desart for accepting the prophets as genuine, the resemblance of their bodily agitations to those de- scribed in Scripture, "That the ancient prophets had the spirit of God upon them under ecstasy, . . . as appears evidently . . . in the instances of Balaam, Saul, David, Ezekiel, Daniel, etc." 9 These symptoms, Shaftesbury remarks, are like the symptoms which the poor gentleman himself labors under. Hereupon Shaftesbury describes seeing Lacy under an agitation, "uttering prophecy in a pompous Latin style, of which, out of his ecstasy, it seems, he is wholly incapable." To witness this sight, Shaftesbury probably attended one of the prophets' meetings in a private bench-filled parlor. Both Shaftesbury and Fowler mention the Latin in Lacy's prophecies, because the fluency of his Latin utterances, contrasting with the paucity of his classical education, was taken by prophets as the prin- cipal proof of his supernatural powers. He had left school at sixteen, having learned no more than Virgil, Horace, and a smattering of Greek, and had seldom turned back again to Latin except on one occasion twenty years prior to his prophecies when he had at- tempted to read Strada de Bello Belgico and, finding himself unable to do so, had laid it aside. In a book publishing the text of his Latin inspirations, he leaves it to the reader to decide whether they can be explained by his early study.10 The sight of Lacy under agitation reminded Shaftesbury of Virgil's description of the Sibyl, whose agonies "were so perfectly like" Lacy's. To show that Virgil's description of the forcible inspir- ing of mind and body is "the very style of our experi- enced author," Shaftesbury paraphrases another pas- sage from A Cry from the Desart, an affirmation under oath that the inspired "undergo a probation, wherein the spirit, by frequent agitations, forms the organs, ordinarily for a month or two before utterance." 11 Although the antics of Lacy and the French prophets were the immediate cause of Shaftesbury's composing 8 (London, 1708), p. 69. 9 P. x in Lacy; 1: 32 in Shaftesbury. 10 The prophetical warnings of John Lacy, ix, London, 1707. 11 Robertson, 1: 33.</page><page sequence="22">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 1951] ENTHUSIASM 317 his letter, his treatment of enthusiasm rests upon a broad literary background from Plato to Henry More, the latter's Enthusiasmus Triumphatus being a direct source of Shaftesbury's concepts. In Miscellaneous Re- f ections Shaftesbury acknowledges borrowing More's principles of the affinity between atheism and enthusi- asm [Sec. I, XLVII &amp; LXVI], the distinction between inspiration and enthusiasm [Sec. II], the influence of melancholy (a sour and morose temper) on enthusiasm [Sec. XV], the spurious imitations of every virtue which melancholy or enthusiasm produces [Sec. XXXVI], and the salutary nature of "devotional en- thusiasm" as seen in such noble minds as Plato and Plotinus [Sec. LXIII].12 Shaftesbury fails to acknowl- edge, however, another fundamental concept which he shares with More, a concept which, once granted makes toleration the only logical response to enthusiasm. This is the principle set forth at length in the section, "Of the Willingness and Patience to suffer in Enthusiasts" [Sec. LIX]. Here More demonstrates that enthusiasts relish persecution and readily accept torture and dteath, apparently being happiest when they feel themselves on the road to martyrdom. Shaftesbury repeats the evi- dence that persecution will fail to curb enthusiasm, but he gives the case a new twist by offering ridicule as an alternative treatment which, he believes, will be effec- tive. More declares the sovereign cause of enthusiasm to be melancholy. Shaftesbury calls it ill humor, which is to him another name for the same thing. Then in- stead of adopting More's threefold remedy or antidote of temperance, humility, and reason, Shaftesbury offers the simpler and all-embracing cure, good humor, the obvious balance or antidote to ill humor. The need of good humor or the good-natured affec- tions in human relationships is a corollary of Shaftes- bury's theories of divine benevolence and human affec- tions in An Inquiry concerning Virtue. To provide a wider audience than that afforded by their plain and systematic form in An Inquiry was probably one of his reasons for publishing the letter. It is not primarily a treatise on religious enthusiasm any more than it is merely another pamphlet in the ephemeral controversy over the Camisards. By applying the principles of An Inquiry to a burning public issue involving such gen- erators of human interest as divinations, miracles, for- eign refugees, the consorting of nobility with the multi- tude, and rumors of sexual irregularities, Shaftesbury assured himself of a hearing. The essay contains three elements, the theory of the nature, origin, and treatment of enthusiasm, the theory of divine benevolence and moral order in the universe restated from An Inquiry, and the application of these theories to the local situa- tion. The combination of these elements inevitably re- sulted in a plea for toleration, which is sincerely and explicitly stated. If it here and there appears super- cilious, it is because of Shaftesbury's efforts to avoid the 12 Ibid. 2: 197-198. ponderousness and pedantry of a formal treatise. It is this plea for freedom of expression which distinguishes his pamphlet from the vast controversy concerning the prophets, which gives his work originality, and which makes his letter significant literature. The interpretation of Shaftesbury's letter as a plea for tolerance is supported by the evidence that Shaftes- bury regarded enthusiasm, the ostensible subject of the letter, as a universal human characteristic. In the first section he classifies enthusiasm as a passion-in its less desirable manifestations linked with the universal de- sire for delusion and self-deception. In the last section he shows the resemblance between inspiration and en- thusiasm-in its salutary manifestation linked with the universal desire for creation and self-expression. He makes the reader's mind go a progress from disapproval to acceptance, from contempt to understanding. Into his introductory dedication and eulogy of Lord Somers, Shaftesbury skillfully interweaves examples of the natural credulousness of mankind, which serve a double purpose of rendering the French prophets more palatable through the emphasis of their universal human traits and of weakening in a single blow the foundations of all religious sects. By citing the ease of feigning po- etic ecstasy in invoking the muse, Shaftesbury prepares for the conclusion that men are "wonderfully happy in a faculty of deceiving themselves, whenever they set heartily about it." By calling to mind the delight in vicarious experience and the pleasure in identifying oneself with fictitious characters, he subtly represents the common basis of faith in old wives' tales and faith in scriptural and traditional miracles. In this connec- tion he introduces Bishop Fowler, the "learned and truly Christian prelate" who is able to give a full ac- count of his belief in fairies. After this rather bold beginning, Shaftesbury, shift- ing to another arena and varying his tactics, attempts to disarm the conservative by complimenting the nation upon its freedom. The general truth that "there can be no impartial and free censure of manners where any peculiar custom or national opinion is set apart, and not only exempted from criticism, but even flattered with the highest art," he follows with the particular as- sertion that court, nobility, and church are denied such privileged exemption. Shaftesbury mingles this state- ment, obviously contrary to fact, with his plaudits on British liberty, hoping by his assertion of a fictitious condition to hasten acceptance of the principle behind it. Lest some should object that British liberty may run too far, Shaftesbury points out the difficulty of deciding to whom should be given authority to set limits on free examination. The best remedy, he insists, is the liberty itself which is complained of. If men reason ill, reason itself must teach them to do better, and if their ridicule is at first misdirected, eventually it will fall where it deserves. Hereupon Shaftesbury treats at some length his notion, to be discussed later, that ridicule should be</page><page sequence="23">318 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. freely permitted against imposture and superstition of all kinds. The remedy of amused toleration is not only effectual, he insists, but the least harmful to truth and to the state. Religious excesses or panics, raised by contagion of passions like fear and terror, are increased when op- posed by the sword, but assuaged if bantered or if the attention of the public is diverted. The ancients, aware of this, had averted bloodshed and persecution by treat- ing superstition and enthusiasm mildly. Here Shaftes- bury is offering the only sensible alternative to the vain project of his countrymen to secure conformity in relig- ion by force. Were the same methods used in the other sciences, he says, "we should have as bad logic, as bad mathematics, and in every kind as bad philosophy, as we often have divinity, in countries where a precise orthodoxy is settled by law." 13 Not only does forcible interdiction fail to stamp out enthusiastic beliefs, he adds, but it is likely to have the contrary effect and promote and propagate them. After rallying advocates of religious conformity with a fanciful prediction of the illicit love affairs and Ar- cadian colonies which would arise if the method of sup- pression and persecution were used against poetic li- cence and the extravagant passion of love "in its heathenish dress of Venuses and Cupids," Shaftesbury proceeds to discuss the relation of good humor to re- ligion. Although asserting that he tries never to think or write on religious subjects without putting himself in as good humor as possible, he is not attempting to deny the seriousness of religion or arguing that it should be treated flippantly. He does state that people who are all air and humor know little of religious doubts and scruples and are thus free from a habitual temper of devout melancholy or enthusiasm. But he continues in a revealing passage which has been overlooked by crit- ics of the letter, friend and foe alike, "Be the habit what it will; to be delivered of it as so sad a cost as inconsid- erateness, or madness, is what I would never wish to be my lot. I had rather stand all adventures wvith relig- ion, than endeavour to get rid of the thoughts of it by diversion." 1 With this preliminary declaration of his own convic- tion of the need for religious feeling, a declaration quite in keeping with the conclusion of Part I of An Inquiry, that "the perfection and height of virtue must be owing to the belief of a God," Shaftesbury proceeds to affirm the need for good humor as a basis of right religion, as "not only the best security against enthusiasm, but the best foundation of piety and true religion." Good hu- mor inclines a person toward a faith that the universe is orderly, kindly, and well disposed, but ill humor drives a man either to atheism, to believing the world is governed by a devilish or malicious power, or to combining sourniess and moroseness with majesty and 13 Robertson, 1: 15. 14Ibid. 1: 17. greatness in conceiving of God. The latter is a false representation, Shaftesbury insists, for among human beings, the most divinely good characters welcome a free and liberal treatment since the more familiarly they are examined, the more their worth appears. Hence religious schismatics make almost no headway wlhen they are tolerated by humane and liberal administra- tions, but they thrive and proselytize under persecution. Paul drew more advantage from the malice of his Jew- ish persecutors than from the utbane and lenient treat- ment of the Athenians. Infant Christianity was nur- tured through the martyrdoms of Rome. Because the French Protestants had fostered the same spirit of mar- tyrdom in their own country, Shaftesbury is warning the English to deny them this weapon by continuing to grant them absolute tolerance. He commends his coun- trymen for refusing to honor the prophets with a perse- cution and for delivering them up to contempt by repre- senting them in puppet shows at Bart'lemy Fair. This type of ridicule Shaftesbury regards as the sovereign remedy against fanaticism, even asserting that the "an- cient heathens" would have had more success in silenc- ing Christianity had they used the Bart'lemy Fair method instead of torture and death. Because of this and similar references, Shaftesbury has been accused of attempting to discredit Christianity and to bring its founder into contempt. His accusers interpret his view that ridicule would have been a pow- erful weapon against Christianity as meaning that Chris- tianity is ridiculous. The two are obviously not the same. There is no doubt that in the Miscellaneous Re- flections he sets out to ridicule the literal inspiration of the Scriptures, an attempt not in the least covert or con- cealed, but the foregoing argument reveals no hostility to Christianity. Just after it he remarks that ridicule had been applied long before the Christian era to the best doctrines and best characters that had then arisen, and these had received no injury, but rather advantage from the attacks. As an example, Shaftesbury points to the ridicule by Aristophanes of Socrates, whom Shaftes- bury describes as the divinest man of the ancient world. "So far was this from sinking his reputation, or sup- pressing his philosophy, that they each increased the more for it; and he apparently grew to be more the envy of other teachers." Since Shaftesbury is placing Christ and Socrates, for whom he expresses high ad- miration, in the same category, he cannot be justly ac- cused of affronting either Christ or Christianity. What he is attacking is the sullen or sour temper which he holds responsible for the gloomy moroseness of conven- tional piety. This "melancholy way of treating religion," Shaftes- bury continues, makes it unlikely that we should turn to it in good humor, but chiefly in adversity or discom- posure of mind or temper, the times in which we are least fit to contemplate anything above us. Actually it is only when we are in the best of humors that we can</page><page sequence="24">VOL. 41, PT. 2,19511 ENTHUSIASM 319 understand the divine attributes and what true goodness is. Then we may best perceive whether "those degrees of punishment, that temper of resentment and those measures of offence and indignation," vulgarly supposed to be in God, agree with the ideas of goodness which have been divinely implanted. The best security against superstition is "to remember that there is nothing in God but what is godlike; and that he is either not at all, or truly and perfectly good." When we are afraid to use our reason freely on "whether he really be, or not," we are presuming him bad and denying his goodness. At this point Shaftesbury uses the Scriptures to prove this right of questioning God, citing the indignation of Job at his friends' flouting of reason, of experience and of actual fact in glossing over the inequities of provi- dence. Job, who had accused his friends of flattering and mocking God, was eventually vindicated for refus- ing to sanction their pious sophistries. Shaftesbury himself has been accused of taking part with Job's friends in asserting the universal benevolence of God and his providence despite the notorious evil and misery prevailing in the world. Shaftesbury was aware of this difficulty, but for the present he defers considering the proofs of divine benevolence in order to attack narrow doctrines which assert divine characteristics on weak grounds. "What virtue," he asks, is there "in assuming an opinion contrary to the appearance of things, and resolving to hear nothing which may be said against it?" None but an ill-natured man can wish against the existence of God, for this is wishing against public and private good, but there is no merit in belief unless based on reason andl understanding. How mistaken then is the opinion which holds that affectation of belief con- trary to reason should ever result in reward hereafter or impartial use of reason in disfavor. "This is being sycophants in religion, mere parasites of devotion." Shaftesbury is condemning the widespread notion found in the works of Tillotson and others that to strive for religious faith is good policy since if God really exists, belief will be rewarded, and if not, nothing is lost through being deceived. This notion is completely mis- taken, Shaftesbury declares, for belief so motivated will bring no happiness in this world or the next, reason will not sanction the cheat, and opinion of the Supreme Deity founded on so injurious a thought will grow steadily worse. It is no more in keeping with the divine character to insist on uniform recognition and praise than it would be for a philanthropic public servant to take offense at individuals in a remote province who had never heard of him or who should be bewildered by odd and contrary stories concerning him. Among human beings it is far less divine to do good for the glory's sake than to do good knowing that the deeds may go unregarded or even be received as inglorious. How unreasonable then to represent the Divine Being as sharing the weak, vain, and malicious traits of hu- man nature. We should, therefore, place no limits on the free use of questioning and reason in religion, for reason must assure us antecedent to revelation or tradition that God exists; this same reason will assure us of his goodness. It is not goodness, but only malice, which we need fear, and we insult God to attribute this human weakness to him. Reason teaches that should there be a universal mind, which must be a good-natured mind since there can be no opposing interests, we should have more cause for comfort than if there be none. Yet, many good and religious people, Shaftesbury observes, would be easier in their minds if they were assured that there were no God. This would be otherwise if men would think of God as kindly and would recognize that malice and similar defects of passion are inconsistent with his supreme goodness. In keeping with his Socratic devotion to self-knowl- edge, Shaftesbury insists that we must discover the nature of our own affections and discern what is lauda- ble or lovely. Then we may consider God. Unless we can first discern the nature of the divine, our praises of God will be ignorant or inept. We shall be like an audience with no ear in music, applauding a great mu- sician. God, like the musician, will set no value upon ignorant commendation, or forced or misplaced ap- plause. To appreciate goodness, one must share the quality in some measure. "The praise of goodness from an unsound hollow heart must certainly make the greatest dissonance in the world." 15 The habit of self-examination will also help in con- trolling what Shaftesbury calls enthusiasm of second- hand, that is, a tendency to be swayed by the testimony of others to believe in false miracles. The right knowl- edge of our passions, including discernment of the growth and power of enthusiasm, will teach us how little weight to give these delusions, which pretend to be morally certain and matter of fact. Shaftesbury asks whether any one of the hundreds who gave testimony to the miracles of the prophets had ever been entirely free from addiction to the sect or its practices and had been esteemed wholly free of melancholy or in all likelihood incapable of enthusiasm. If not, the panic or enthusi- asm may have been caught by contagion and each indi- vidual swayed by the general delusion. Deception, conscious or unconscious, is a simple matter, Shaftes- bury declares, for according to descriptions of prophetic agitations in sacred or divine histories, "the spirit is everywhere the same as to the bodily organs." Sup- porting his theory of the induced nature of enthusiasm, Shaftesbury introduces his own experience in witness- ing Lacy prophesying under ecstasy, and by dint of a series of quotations from Latin classics, he shows that the enthusiasm or revived prophecy of the moderns was of a nature exactly similar to the fanaticism and frenzv of the ancients. The evidence of avowed materialists 15Ibid. 1: 30.</page><page sequence="25">320 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. such as Epicurus and Lucretius admitting visionary fancies in their schemes, and of Lucretius making use of inspiration when writing against it reveals, accord- ing to Shaftesbury, the principle that mankind has an innate disposition towards supernatural objects. In the remainder of the letter Shaftesbury tries to show that this native tendency to enthusiasm is not al- ways to be suppressed forcibly as something entirely evil, for it is akin to creative inspiration. The sublime in human passions, the spirit of heroes, statesmen, poets, orators, musicians, and philosophers may be regarded as noble enthusiasm in the same sense in which Plato called inspiration, divine enthusiasm. From outward appearance (livine inspiration and enthusiasm are in- distinguishable. Although inspiration is a real feeling of the Divine Presence, and enthusiasm a false one, "the passion they raise is much alike." Our great task, therefore, is to discern the several kinds of enthusiasm, both in ourselves and in others. Before we are compe- tent to judge whether the spirits be of God, "we must antecedently judge our own spirit, whether it be of rea- son and sound sense; whether it be fit to judge at all, by being sedate, cool, and impartial, free of every bi- assing passion, every giddy vapour, or melancholy fume." 16 After this we may judge the spirit in others and weigh the validity of their testimony by their per- sonal merit and the solidity of their brain. This delib- erate and tolerant method rather than persecution or suppression, Shaftesbury offers as the antidote to en- thusiasm and delusion, adding that it is best performed by keeping to good humor lest "the remedy itself may turn to the disease." The purpose of the whole letter, he says, has been to show that enthusiasm is wonderfully powerful and extensive and that to identify it or to know it fully and distinctly is an extremely difficult task requiring acute powers of discernment. In the final paragraph Shaftesbury recognizes that he has "in some measure justified enthusiasm, and owned the word." Although two hundred years after the event it is pos- sible to analyze Shaftesbury's letter and conclude its main drift to be that truth is the most powerful thing in the world, in its own day the letter was not thus dispassionately viewed. Bishop Fowler, whom Shaftes- bury had derided for his belief in fairies, attacked, with blunt sarcasm and labored good humor in his Remarks upon the Letter to a Lord concerning Enthusiasm, 1708, Shaftesbury's attitude toward miracles and toward the "reality of Invisible Beings." The author of Reflections upon a Letter concerning Enthusiasm, 1709, after en- dorsing the Remarks and proposing to follow its exam- ple of mixing levity and seriousness, jointly reviewed and ridiculed Shaftesbury's principles. Typical of his sallies is the query, why is not the world completely moral if, as is alleged, stage plays and puppet shows are effective in reforming society.17 With some meas- ure of perception he points out that Shaftesbury's "great 16 Ibid 1: 38. 17 Op. cit., 28-29. point" is an oblique levelling of the pretended inspira- tions of modern prophets with those in the Scriptures. He also asserts that Shaftesbury's accusations leveled at the malice of God actually concern God's justice, a necessary and noble attribute.18 In similar vein, Mary Astell's Bart'lemy Fair: or, an Enquiry after Wit, 1709, subjects Shaftesbury's letter to almost two hundred pages of unrelieved irony. Using the method of re- ductio ad absurdum., the author suggests that a puppet show be acted in honor of the lord to whom Shaftes- bury's letter is dedicated. If the writer were to treat his lord with the same "good manners" he shows to- ward God, she asserts, he might end up in the pillory or in an insane asylum.19 In the midst of much tedious raillery is found some forward-looking social criticism, although probably unconscious and certainly irrelevant to Shaftesbury's principles. The author points out that in society it is ridiculous for lords and misers to enjoy privileges and wealth and for men of genius and talents to be despised; contrary to Shaftesbury's letter, there- fore, follies, extravagances, and impostures (those of wealth and social position) are privileged and "not only exempted from Criticism, but even flatter'd with the highest Art." 20 In the same year, 1709, Robert Jenkins in his Re- marks on some Books lately publish'd described Shaftes- bury's letter in such terms as "execrable Design, ma- licious and ignorant Falshood, false and wicked Insinu- ations, little Efforts of Wit and Malice, he acts a Popish part, he fights against God, he hath little regard to good Sense, he promotes Deism and Atheism, his Book is Crepitas Satanae." 21 In the next year, 1710, passages from Shaftesbury's letter were read aloud and publicly condemned in the House of Lords during the trial of Henry Sacheverell. In the same month in which Shaftesbury's pamphlet was listed among the recent publications in History of the Works of The Learned, August, 1708, it was bit- terly assaulted in Censura Ternporum as a work out- doing even such a "detestable book as Bayle's Miscel- laneous Reflexions" and described as "Nine or ten Sheets full of such flagrant Buffoonry, Raillery and Ridicule upon all Religion, Natural as well as Reveal'd, as are enough to shock an ordinary Atheist." Since this extravagant attack is the earliest I know of, preceding Fowler's by two months, and one hitherto not noticed, it deserves more than cursory mention. Cens-ura Tern- porum is a monthly periodical in dialogue form in which are considered, according to its subtitle, "the Good or Ill Tendencies of Books, Sermons, Pamphlets." The author, Samuel Parker, apparently more alert for ill tendencies than good, seems to have appointed himself 18 Ibid., 68-74. 19 Op. cit., 37-42. 20 Ibid., 62-63. 21 Quoted by John Edwards, Some new discoveries of the un- certainty, deficiency, and corruptions of human knowledge and learning, 200, London, 1714.</page><page sequence="26">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 1951] ENTHUSIASM 321 a one man. Watch and Ward Society over the London bookshops. Few works could have seemed to him more incendiary than Shaftesbury's letter, for he has one of his characters remark that he cannot look into it with- out trembling and that almnost every period seems to come like a flash from Hell. Since the dialogue form in Censura Terporum is purely artificial, I shall sum- marize the charges against Shaftesbury without refer- ence to Sophronius or Eubulus by whom they are ut- tered. The first charge is that the author admits his letter to be an outrageous assault upon the Divine Majesty, "beyond all the Mockery and Insolence of the Soldiers in the Praetorium." This is based on Shaftes- bury's notion that the Romans could have done more to stem Christianity by using banter and burlesque than by persecution. According to Parker, the application of Shaftesbury's methoid of bantering, the suggestion that Christianity might have been suppressed by exhib- iting Christ and the apostles in puppet shows, is nothing but thinly-veiled blasphemy, a mixture of malice and contempt. Parker next objects that Socrates is given a more favorable treatment than Christ, being put into the hands of the wittiest of all poets and brought onto the stage of the Athenian theatre whereas Christ and the apostles are to be brought to trial in, a puppet booth. Parker attempts to conceal the pettiness of this argu- ment by apostrophizing God in capital letters and de- claiming in a gust of amazed rhetoric: "How great are the Riches of thy Mercy, that thou withholdest thy Hand from discharging Thunderbolts thick upon us for such towering Eruptions of Blasphemy!" Parker has a more legitimate argument in listing the opprobrious phrases which Shaftesbury uses in refer- ence to Christianity. Among those he cites are the descriptions of a Christian as "a Volunteer in Faith" and "one who would needs be over good, and thinks he can never believe enough." Those which purport to describe Christianity include: A new sort of Policy . . . which extends it self to another World, and considers the future Lives and Happiness of Men, rather than the present, has made us leap the Bounds of Natural Humanity; and out of a supernatural Charity, has taught us the way of Plaguing one another most de- voutly. -The saving of Souls is now the Heroick Pas- sion of exalted Spirits. -Militant Religion, Soul rescuing Spirit, and Saint Errantry. -Odd and contrary Stories told up and down. -Delusions which come arm'd with the specious Pretext of Moral Certainty, and Matter of Fact. Certainly these phrases are disrespectful to certain phases of Christianity, intentionally so. Shaftesbury is using his favorite weapon, ridicule, to discredit big- otry, selfishness, vanity, and narrowness, characteristics which he had previously attacked in general and indi- rect terms in the Inquiry. The Letter is merely the free application of ridicule to the specific characteristics of opinion ancl conduct which deny the principles of divine benevolence and human affection laid down in An In- quiry. It is only with regard to this doctrine of the goodness of God that Parker rises above trivialities and discusses a real principle. He charges that the author has no notion "of any Moral Virtue or Perfection, but Good Nature," that he emphasizes the good nature of God to the exclusion of his justice. He would have it, according to Parker, that it is unreasonable to expect regularity and obedience and that "the World's ill dealt with, if 'tis not left to tear it self in pieces." Parker finds this view even less palatable than that of Epicurus, who had represented God as indifferent but not weak; whereas God is here represented as interested in the world, but unoffended if his creatures "run riot, dispute his Authority, and oppose his measures." This is an extreme representation of Shaftesbury's argument, de- signed to influence the reader against it. This aspect of Shaftesbury's theology appears less ludicrous, how- ever, in his own words: "One would think it were easy to understand that provocation and offence, anger, re- venge, jealousy in point of honour or power, love of fame, glory and the like, belong only to limited beings, and are necessarily excluded a being which is perfect and universal." 22 The reader will have to decide for himself whether Shaftesbury's meaning is the same as Parker's. This need of interpretation is one of the main causes of the controversies over the Letter. It is difficult to say with certainty when Shaftesbury is serious, when ironical, and when in jest. Thus Parker charges that one main drift of the letter is to dress up all religion in the garb of enthusiasm and then to condemn the two indiscrimi- nately. This charge may be either defended or refuted according to the interpretation which one puts on Shaftesbury's words. When the letter is viewed in the light of An Inquiry concerning Virtue, one realizes that Shaftesbury's profound veneration for pure theism led him to ridicule crude and narrow misrepresentations and perversions of it, but not the religious spirit itself. When Parker comes to the end of his critique he really has proved nothing against Shaftesbury. Perhaps realizing the tenuousness of his initial at- tack, Parker returns to the Letter in, the next issue of Censura Terporum, September, 1708. Here he makes a flanking attack on Shaftesbury's theory of good hu- mor, one more telling than his original sally, but still insufficient to demolish it. Shaftesbury in his constant emphasis on the necessity of good humor in approach- ing religion had, written that we are never so unfit to think of religion as in adversity "in ill health, under affliction, or disturbance of mind, or discomposure of temper," the occasions when we ordinarily have re- course to it.23 Parker asks what we shall do then "upon a Sick Bed, under the Smart of any sore Calam- ity, or the Pressure of a groaning Spirit; much more at the Hour of Death." It is hard indeed, he says, to 22 Robertson, 1: 28. 23 Ibid. 1: 24.</page><page sequence="27">322 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. Soc. believe that when we are most in need of religious meditations we are most unfit for them. Indeed, he asserts, it is most inconsistent with the divine good nature, which is elsewhere insisted upon, "so to dis- pose things, that the more occasion we have for that solid Relief and Support Religious Considerations af- ford, the less we should be capable of them." If Shaftesbury were to reply to this charge, he probably would not deny that religion may be a source of solace in affliction, but would hold to his assertion that this is still not a proper condition in which to formulate opinions about the divine character and the order of the world. Not all the responses to Shaftesbury's letter were un- friendly although all those published in England were. In France, the Catholic authors of Journal des Sgavans "treated him with sufficient candour" even though they objected to his theology and his jumbled style. The authors of Bibliothetque Choisie and Histoire des Ou- vrages des Savans, described by Shaftesbury as "Prot- estant writers, such as live in a free country, and can deliver their sentiments without constraint," 24 gave fa- vorable reviews, and LeClerc defended Shaftesbury's style against the charge of disorder, possibly at Shaftes- bury's suggestion, on the ground that he was writing a letter, not a treatise. In Miscellaneous Reflectionis Shaftesbury took notice of these French comments, but ignored the zealots of his own country who had, attacked him. In a private letter to Michael Ainsworth, however, he gave his opin- ion of the reflections which were commonly sold with his pamphlet. The authors, he wrote, care not who defends religion, or how it is defended, if it be not in their wcay. They cry out upon a deluge of scepti- cism breaking out and over-whelming us, in this witty knowing age; and yet they will allow no remedy proper in the case, no application to the world in a more genteel, polite, open, and free way. They for their parts (witness Dr. A y against the good Mr. H y) have asserted virtue upon baser principles, and more false and destructive by far, than EPICURUS, DEMOCRITUS, ARISTIPPUS, or any of the ancient atheists. They have subverted all morality, all grounds of honesty, and sup- planted the whole doctrine of our SAVIOUR, under pre- tence of magnifying his revelation. In philosophy they give up all foundations, all principles of society, and the very best arguments to prove the being of a Deity. And, by the way, this pamphlet, which they are so offended at, is so strong on this head, that the author asserts the Deity even on the foundations of his inniate idea, and the power of this notion even over atheists themselves, and by the very concession of EPICURUS and that sect.25 This passage clearly reveals that the pamphlet repre- sented to Shaftesbury a plea for good-humor and tol- erance in religious faith and a vindication of the moral integrity of man and the universe as the most valid proof of the existence of God. 24Ibid. 2: 167. 25 May 5th, 1709.

PROVIDENCE Whether some Soul, incompassing this Ball, Unmade, unmov'd, yet making, moving All; Or various Atom's, interfering Dance Leapt into Form (the Noble work of Chance,) Or this great All was from Eternity. -John Dryden, Religio Laici. An Intquiry concerning Virtue and A Letter conicernt- ing Enthusiasmn have been treated separately in individ- ual chapters because they appeared first and contain the essence of Shaftesbury's thought. An Inquiry, more- over, is a formal treatise presented in orderly fashion, inviting the reader to pursue an ordered way through it. The other treatises of the Characteristics, however, with the possible exception of The Moralists, are mis- cellaneous and digressive and are therefore in subse- quent chapters not considered as entities, but merely as depositories of miscellaneous n'otions which may be arranged according to five or six broad topics or sub- jects. According to Joseph Warton, Shaftesbury wrote The Moralists as a direct confutation of Bayle's Manichean opinions, a plausible theory, for the treatise, although it attacks in passing the philosophies of Descartes, Hobbes, and Locke, is substantially a presentation of the problem of evil, ultimately resolved in a triumphal declaration that evil has only apparent, not real, exist- ence.1 Although Shaftesbury removes the problem from theological controversy to ethics, on which level he had touched on it in An Inquiry, he gives the im- pression that he is writing against a clever antagonist and using every device at his command to refute, if not to convince, him. The treatise contains four answers to the Manichees: (1) natural law is responsible for so-called natural evils, which in themselves demonstrate law and order; (2) positive good is attainable by all men through control of the passions; (3) the unity of the universe is itself a proof of order; and (4) the evil complained of has only apparent existence, a truth we do not perceive because we fail to view the entire sys- tem. In addition the treatise contains (1) a defence of arguing for the providence of God on moral grouncls as not contrary to religion; (2) a denunciation of Hobbes' state of nature theory; (3) a discussion of the place of miracles in Christian evidences; and (4) an analysis of the stages of experience in estlhetic response. The Moralists as a rlhapsodic dialogue has an ana- logue in Henry More's Divinie Dialogues published in 1668. Much longer and more detailed than The Moral- ists and cluttered with theological disputations, the Di- vine Dialogues contain such kindred matters as proofs of the existence of God from the system of the universe and the anatomy of its creatures, replies to the objec- tions raised against providence on the ground of evil in the world and limitation of the good, an assertion of the existence of a natural sense in man which reacts 1 Works of Alexander Pope 3: 58, London, 1806.</page><page sequence="28">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 19511 PROVIDENCE 323 against moral defornmities, and an argument that belief in providence strengthens faith in revealed Christianity. Shaftesbury could have written on these subjects with- out having heard of either MIore or Bayle, but since he was both a personal friend and correspondent of Bayle, it is logical to assume that much of his incentive to de- fend the benevolence of the universe came directly from Bayle's contrary opinion. The essence of Bayle's criti- cism of providence, which incorporates nearly all of the common arguments on the subject, is found in three articles of his dictionary, "Paulicians," "Marcionites," and "Manichees." Fearing prosecution on charges of blasphemy, Bayle did not dare present his criticisms of providence as his own opinions but represented them as purely historical attitudes, or what the Manichees would say if they were living in a later age. In the arti- cle "Paulicians" he summarizes all of the arguments brought against the Manichean account of the origin of evil and exposes a fallacy in each one. Then he asserts that the objections of the Manichees are unanswerable by reason and that the only proof of the supremacy of good is the Word of God. Ironically, he affirms that for him the issue of the controversy rests on the maxim, "From matter of fact to possibility, the consequence is good," and on the enthymeme, "This has come to pass, therefore it is not repugnant to the holiness and good- ness of God." Almost humorously, he keeps returning to his only possible way out of the dilemma: evil exists and is, as a consequence, according to the will of God; therefore it is good. Only faith, he iterates, can bring us to this solution. This amused orthodoxy is probably Bayle's self-pro- tection against heresy-proceedings. Shaftesbury was no more satisfied with such a solution than was Bayle, but he believed that he could, in opposition to Bayles' Manicheism, prove the benevolence of the universe by purely moral reasoning. He thus deliberately ignored the doctrinal disputes of the theologians. Bayle also discusses the problem on general philosophical grounds in the article "Manichees," which may be considered as a fair statement of the principles Shaftesbury is oppos- ing. The article contains an imaginary dialogue be- tween Melissus and Zoroaster, the latter defending the duality of good and evil by a series of questions. "If man is the creature of one principle perfectly good, most holy and omnipotent, can he be exposed to diseases, to heat and cold, hunger and thirst, pain and grief? can he have so many bad inclinations? can he commit so many crimes? can perfect holiness produce a criminal creature? can perfect goodness produce an unhappy creature?" Melissus might answer that man was orig- inally happy, but becoming wicked through his own choice, became unhappy as the effect of God's wrath. God is not the cause of moral evil, but of physical evil, which is the punishment of moral evil, a punishment which flows necessarily from perfect goodness, being essential to justice. Zoroaster then would reply that if God were truly good and holy, he would have created man not only without actual evil, but without an inclina- tion toward evil. Therefore "man, coming out of the hands of his Creator, had only the power of determin- ing himself to evil, and . . . having determined him- self to it, he was the sole cause of the crime, which he committed, and of the moral evil, which has introduced itself into the world." Zoroaster might then have ex- plained the intermixture of good and evil in the universe by hypothecating principles of good and evil in a state of nature at war over supremacy. To bring an end to the struggle, it might be assumed, they agreed to share the whole, and hence both the good and the bad princi- ples obtained some influence over the affairs of man and the universe. It is this hypothesis, which describes the gods in terms of Hobbes' theory of the origin of human society, that Shaftesbury attacks in The Moralists. In this eighteenth-century version of the Book of Job, Philocles, the narrator, represents the man of sceptic temper, the proponent of 'liberty in reasoning, who re- jects unproved assumptionls ancl demands rational dem- onstrations; Palemon, who propounds the problem of evil, is loosely the spokesman for Bayle or the Mlani- cheans; Theocles, whose rhapsodies or nature hymns serve as contrast to Palemon's rants, is the spokesman for Shaftesbury himself or the advocates of a benevolent universe, and the anonymous formal sort of gentleman, whose remarks seem uniformly to confuse the issue, represents orthodox divinity. The problem is introduced with the following rant: O wretched state of mankind! Hapless Nature, thus to have erred in thy chief workmanship! Whence sprang this fatal weakness? What chance or destiny shall we accuse? Or shall we mind the poets when they sing thy tragedy, Prometheus! who with thy stolen celestial fire, mixed with vile clay, didst mock heaven's countenance, and in abusive likeness of the immortals madest the compound man: that wretched mortal, ill to himself, and cause of ill to all.2 Throughout the dialogue the fable of Prometheus sym- bolizes the various explanations, philosophical and theo- logical, which have been used to explain evil in the world. For the moment Palemon is satisfied with the beauty of the landscape and the planetary system; his com- plaint is directed solely against human kind. Man, he feels, is both ridiculous and vile. His ridiculousness is shown in the artificial gallantry which prevails between the sexes in' the beau monde; his vileness in the hy- pocrisy and corruption of the political and economic worlds. Hence Palemon asks concerning evil in gen- eral, "through what contingency, what chance, by what fatal necessity, what will, or what permission, it came upon the world; or being come once, should still sub- sist." He repeats that all the rest of creation is beauti- ful except mankind, and struggles to find a Prometheus symbol by which he can exonerate God for the faults and blemishes of mankind. Philocles, however, com- pares the Prometheus fable to the Indian tale of the 2 Robertson, 2: 10.</page><page sequence="29">324 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. world being supported by an elephant and the elephant by other animals, with the difference that, Prometheus being enough to take the weight from Jove, the Greeks did not go beyond the first remove. The philosophers would say that either the gods could have prevented Prometheus' creation or not. If they could, they were answerable for the consequences; if they could not, they were no longer Gods, being thus lim- ited and controlled. And whether Prometheus were a name for chance, destiny, a plastic nature, or an evil daemon, whatever was designed by it, 'twas still the same breach of omnipotence.3 Philocles refuses to accept the hypothesis that the work of creation was for the best, that "even from this misery and ill of man, there was undoubtedly some good aris- ing; something which overbalanced all, and made full amends." Such, a hypothesis of doing ill that good may follow, Philocles affirms, is never accepted in human actions in which we do not justify a bad means by a good end. Such a hypothesis shows the gods in the light of mountebanks who "could create diseases, and make mischief, in order to heal, and to restore," a com- parison which reminds us of Bayle's characterizing orthodox attempts to exonerate God for evil as com- paring God to a father who allows his children to break their bones in order to exhibit his skill in setting them. Shaftesbury's first definite answer to the critics of providence is the theory that the operation of natural law is responsible for so-called natural evils. Philocles does not follow the customary attempt to explain the production of an erring nature from an unerring han(l. Instead he denies that she errs. The apparent coln- trarieties, diversities of interests, oppositions of various orders, he affirms, actually show the beauty and order of the world; "from such various and disagreeing prin- ciples, a universal concord is established." The sacri- fice of one nature to another, the consumning of v\egte- tables by animals, the succession of insects, birds and beasts, all show the operation of natural law. Although natural law may at times seem harsh, we would never want to see it suspended, to see, for example, the law of gravitation upset to rescue from a precipice a puny animal which would die soon anyway in the due course of events. Earthquakes, storms, fires, monstrous births exhibit "nature still working as before, and not per- versely or erroneously, not faintly, or with feeble en- deavours; but overpowered by a superior rival, and bv another nature's justly conquering force." Moral evils, the deformities of soul and temper, may be explainecl by the same hypothesis, for the interior form dependent on exterior forces must partake likewise of their occa- sional deformities. This is perhaps the best answer that call possibly be given to the problem of evil. It appears in More's Di- vine Dialogues, and, strangely enough, it is even more clearly and explicitly stated by Bayle. In his Pensees 3Ibid. 2: 16. diverses sur la conzete, Bayle points out that the mate- rial world is governed by one set of laws, the moral world by another. Actually we would not want them to merge; yet we complain that they do not in all argu- ments over the problem of evil. For example, we criti- cize providence for allowing the prosperity of the wicked. Yet to expect that God should make a wicked man fall ill oni account of his wickedness is as foolish as if we expected a rock to fall on a vase and not break it.4 In a later section of The Moralists Shaftesbury pre- sents a variation of the argument in discussing the en- ergy of nature.5 Every particular nature, he asserts, constantly produces what is good for itself unless it is hindered by some foreign nature, either corrupting it from within or overpowering it from without. All the "weaknesses, distortions, sicknesses, imperfect births, and the seeming contradictions and perversities" are caused, not by the miscarriage of the particular nature, but by the force of some foreign nature. It is the na- ture of the whole universe to produce what is good for itself just as this is the nature of every particular ele- ment. Since there is nothing foreign which can do violence to the whole, all it produces is to its own good, the good of all in general. "And what is for the good of all in general, is just and good." Although the argument from the laws of nature may ,b)e the best vindication of providence, Shaftesbury does not rest his case here. Bayle had asserted that if a good principle alone exists, pure virtue would be "our pleas- ure, our desire, and our happiness." 6 If Shaftesbury can convince us that virtue is to the interest of everyone in this life, which is tantamount to proving virtue su- preme in the universe, he may be said to have given an adequate solution to the problem of evil. This prin- ciple had been the basis of Book II of An Inquiry, but in the person of Theocles, Shaftesbury goes through the argument again, proving good to be neither pleasure nor the gratification of the passions. Good is found in the exercise of reason and judgment, in mental satisfac- tions, which may be considered as pleasure only in the broadest sense of the word. Pleasure in the narrow sense cannot be good, for what is pleasure to one man may be pain to another. Philocles, half-way dissenting, observes that if pleasure be not good, nothing is, for we are convinced that its opposite, pain, is indeed ill. With this challenge, Theocles undertakes to show in gradual stages "what that good is, or where, which can afford contentment and satisfaction always alike, without vari- ation or diminution." Philocles is without much diffi- culty brought to admit that the first step, performing generous services for a friend, is a constant good capable of being attained, but he experiences trouble in advanc- ing to the next step, a mystical love of mankind. The- 4Sec. 231. 5 Robertson, 2: 106. 6 "Paulicians." 7 Robertson, 2: 29 ff.</page><page sequence="30">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 1951] PROVIDENCE 325 ocles then suggests the possibility of feeling affection for the mental images of friends whom we know by corre- spondence alone or for the noble citizens of an ancient kingdom. Then he suggests that a love for the Genius of the People may be transferred to the Sovereign Genius and First Beauty of the World, which would be sensible of its love and capable of a return. After this somewhat tentative conclusion, he starts anew on a somewhat different course, bringing up the quality of temperance for discussion and securing assent that it is a virtue and that it is of advantage to everyone who attains it. Since temperance is the parent of all virtues, he suggests, by attaining it we have within our grasp whatever is good, generous or great. After several digressions, Shaftesbury again resolves the issue of the goodness of the world upon the triumph of virtue or vice. If virtue is rewarded by happiness, providence is vindicated; but if in the nature of things virtue is "unprovided for, and vice more prosperous be the better choice, . . . then is all order in reality in- verted, and supreme wisdom lost." 8 To prove the for- mer condition, Theocles states as a primary principle that before we may judge what is good or ill we must understand "the fabric of the mind, the constitution of the soul, the connection and frame of all its passions and affections." If we were to make this inquiry, The- ocles continues, we would realize that the government of the temper, regulation of the appetites and balance of the passions would reveal beauty and decorum within man as well as elsewhere in nature, "and the order of the moral world would equal that of the natural." This balance and order is obviously within the choice of every man, and, when it is made, the beauty of virtue appears and with it the perception of deity, "the Su- preme and Sovereign Beauty, the original of all which is good or amiable." The principle of unity as an infallible sign of order is Shaftesbury's sovereign proof of the goodness of providence. In all phases of Shaftesbury's thought, in ethics, in literary theory, in formal esthetics, and in teleology, his fundamental principle is the uniting scheme, the symbol of the union of all parts within the whole. In the person of Theocles he asks how there can exist an idea of order and perfection un- less nature possesses it and how a creature himself formed by nature can possibly discover imperfection in nature and presume to correct it. He reminds us that "nothing surely is more strongly imprinted on our minds . . . than the idea or sense of order and proportion." 9 By reason we realize that "whatever things have order, the same have unity of design, and concur in one; are parts constituent of one whole, or are in themselves, entire systems." From this we un- derstand that if all the parts of the universe are not united into one system, there can be inferred no order, proportion, or design, but if all of the parts are united, 8 Ibid. 2: 67. 9Ibid. 2: 63. "then is the whole a system complete, according to one simple, consistent, and uniform design." When we examine the universe, we realize that none of its Farts are independent, but all are united and related to the system. The earth, plants, animals, and the elements are all related and interdependent, as are the world, the planets and the sun, and all show the "order, union, and coherence of the whole." Shaftesbury does not go so far as some other eight- eenth- and twentieth-century zealots in copying whole textbooks of anatomy and botany to prove the existence of God, but his method is related to this system of rea- soning. Holbach points out that this absurd system only makes known that certain beings exist in nature who would not exist if their parts were organized in a different manner.'0 Hume asserts that Shaftesbury's reasoning concerning the uniting principle of the uni- verse and the identical subsistence of plants and animals is a confusing of identity with related succession and the imagining of "something unknown and mysterious connecting the parts, beside their relation." 11 As Shaftesbury continues with his presentation of the uniting scheme, he implies that it is a much more con- vincing proof of the existence of God than the better- known demonstrations of Locke and Clarke. Philocles is amazed at the simplicity of the uniting principle com- pared with the complexity of more conventional proofs. I expected to have heard from you, in customary form, of a first cause, a first being, and a beginning of motion. How clear the idea was of an immaterial substance, and how plainly it appeared, that at some time or other matter must have been created. But as to all this you are silent. As for what is said of "A material unthinking substance being never able to have produced an immaterial thinking one," I readily grant it, but on the condition that this great maxim of nothing being ever made from nothing may hold as well on my side as my adversary's. And then, I sup- pose, that whilst the world endures, he will be at a loss how to assign a beginning to matter, or how to suggest a possi- bility of annihilating it.12 This form of reasoning, in substance the conventional Newtonian and Lockean argument, Shaftesbury rejects as inconclusive, for it may be applied in just the oppo- site fashion to show that "the poor dregs of sorry mat- ter can no more be made out of the simple pure sub- stance of immaterial thought, than the high spirits of thought can be extracted from the gross substance of heavy matter." Shaftesbury is captious, not because he does not believe in God or Providence, but merely be- cause he does not accept Locke's proofs as he elsewhere likewise rejects those of Descartes. The final phase of the argument that unity itself is a sign of order is founded on the philosophical problem of identity. The problem concerns such questions as whether Socrates is the same man at six and at sixty, when waking and sleeping, when drunk and sober, when 10 System of nature 2, Chap.

The answer will depend on whether personality consists in matter, form, individual number, spirit, consciousness, memory, or a combina- tion of qualities. Locke gives a lengthy discussion of the problem in which he declares that the identity of the same man consists "in nothing but a participation of the same continued life, by constantly fleeting particles of matter, in succession vitally united to the same organ- ized body." 13 Personal identity, he asserts, consists in the unity of self-consciousness of a thinking, intelligent being. Although asserting that consciousness is an- nexed to an immaterial thinking substance, Locke dis- cusses elsewhere in his essay the other possibility that God may have given to some systems of matter a power to think just as he gave to some the power to live.14 This became one of the doctrines most bitterly con- demned by Locke's opponents because, on this supposi- tion, it could be maintained, and actually w'as often maintained in the eighteenth century, that it is material substance which thinks in human beings. This incipient materialism became the main principle of contention in an extended controversy between Sam- uel Clarke and Anthony Collins. The controversy arose out of a discourse by a nonjuring clergyman, Henry Dodwell, who attempted to prove that the soul is a prin- ciple naturally mortal, which may be made immortal by the pleasure of God through the sacrament of bap- tism. Clarke, in replying, attempted to prove the im- materiality and natural immortality of the soul, and Collins, in answering Clarke, ostensibly undertook the defence of Dodwell, but actually used the controversy as a convenient means of spreading his own material- istic opinions. The central points at issue were those of personal identity and the essence of thought. Col- lins maintained that "Personal Identity consists in Consciousness, and that Consciousness is only a Mode in a fleeting System of Matter." 15 Clarke, on the other hand, maintained that personal identity consisted in the soul or principle of thinking and that the soul is imma- terial."6 In arguing whether thinking is a property of mate- rial or immaterial substance, both became involved in the problem of identity. Collins's theory that conscious- ness, a property of material substance, is a "fleeting transferrible Mode or Power" was attacked on the ground that it makes "Individual Personality to be a mere external imiaginary Denomination, and nothing at all in reality: Just as a Ship is called the same Ship, after the Whole Substance is changed by frequent Re- 13 Essay concerninhg humnani understanding, Bk.

"Since it is not possible for those individual numerical Acts of Thinking or Consciousness that are past to exist again; the same numerical Being, with the same numerical individual Consciousness, can- not exist at two different times, and consequently can- not possibly be rewarded or punished for an Action done." 18 This difficulty Collins felt was obviated in his hypothesis "that present Consciousness or Memory is nothing but a present Represenitation of a past Action, and that personal Identity consists only in having such a Consciousness or Memory." The controversy over identity is used by Shaftesbury as a device to inculcate the principle of the world as "one entire thing" governed by a divine artificer or universal genius. He makes the concept concrete by analogy with objects from nature, demonstrating the difference between the oneness and sameness of a real tree and the lack of inner consistence of a tree shaped of wax or accidentally made in the sand or the clouds. The real tree forms a whole or oneness hecause of the concurrence of its parts towards the common end of its support, nourishment, and propagation. "By virtue of this, our tree is a real tree, lives, flourishes, and is still one and the same even when by vegetation and change of substance not one particle of it remains the same." 19 Despite Shaftesbury's interest in the problem of iden- tity, his attitude toward the related question of the im- materiality and immortality of the soul, judged by a subsequent passage, is one of complete indifference. Philocles, after hearing the rhapsody over the oneness of the tree, suggests that trees and rivulets have their hamadryads and nymphs belonging to them, "and these too, by what I can apprehend, of immaterial and immor- tal substances." Theocles replies that it is an injustice to say "they belong to these trees" rather than "these trees to them," but as for their immortality "let them look to it themselves." They and all other natures "must for their duration depend alone on that nature on which the world depends." This sardonic phantasy shows that for Shaftesbury matters of theology and, per- sonal immortality are secondary, his basic concern be- ing to show that an intelligent cause superintends all natural manifestations in the universe. Going from trees to human beings, Shaftesbury pro- ceeds to give his solution of the problem of individual personality. The experience of each human being will 17 A Third Defence, ibid., 290-291. 18 An Answer to Mr. Clarke's 3rd Defenice, ibid., 370-371. 19 Robertson, 2: 100.

There is a "strange simplicity," Shaftesbury feels, that a person- ality should be one and the same "when neither one atom of body, one passion, nor one thought remains the same." He scorns the materialistic explanation that matter or a particle of matter remains with us when everything else is changed because he feels that "mat- ter itself is not really capable of such simplicity." But whatever be supposed of uncompounded matter, when matter is put together in frames like ours, we perceive this simple uniting principle by which individuals "are really one, live, act, and have a nature or genius peculiar to themselves, and provident for their own welfare." How then can we "overlook this in the whole, and deny the great and general ONE of the world ?" 20 To the question of the sceptic Philocles concerning whether the invisible powers of the universe are of ma- terial or immaterial substance, Theocles replies with a counter-question, asking Philocles whether he considers his own self to be material or immaterial, or, if he pre- fers to be of no substance, whether he chooses to call himself a mode or accident. Regarding this aspect of the problem as a useless logomachy, Shaftesbury finds identity neither, like Collins, in matter, nor, like Clarke, in spirit, but in a uniting principle, which forms the personality or self of the individual as well as the self of nature or the world. Whatever objections an indi- vidual may raise against the existence of a supreme being will apply with equal force to his own existence. Metaphysical points of mode and substance may lead to the conclusion "that there cannot be in Nature such a universal One as this," but the same reasoning must also conclude that "there cannot be any such particular one as yourself," a conclusion which the particular mind itself rejects as absurd. Whatever is true of the unity of the individual is true of the universe as well. At this point Shaftesbury describes a pair of theories which deny the administering mind of the universe. One is a modern hypothesis, that "the world was from eternity as you see it, and is no more than barely what you see: 'Matter modified; a lump in motion, with here and there a thought or scattered portion of dissoluble intelligence.'" The other hypothesis affirms that "the world was once without any intelligence or thought at all: 'Mere matter, chaos, and a play of atoms, till thought, by chance, came into play, and made up a har- mony which was never designed or thought of.' 'p21 Shaftesbury identifies the latter hypothesis as that of Epicurus, but says no more about the former. In an- cient times the mechanistic theory of the eternity of the world had been proclaimed by Strato, and in the seven- teenth century, we are told on the authority of Cud- worth. Strato's ghost had begun to walk in the form of 20 Robertson, 2: 102. 21 Ibid. 2: 105. revived hylozoism.22 It is possible, therefore, that Shaftesbury is merely attacking the theory in general without attaching it to a particular philosopher.23 He may, on the other hand, be referring to Collins, who had propounded a theory that thought is produced by an aggregation of separate particles which in themselves lack the power of thought. This may explain Shaftes- bury's phrase, "dissoluble intelligence." The reference to the eternity of the world may concern Collins's strange promise to conclude his debate with Clarke with an essay demonstrating the existence of God and proving the creation of matter ex nihilo. It is a strange promise because Collins makes no attempt to carry it out, but implies instead that it cannot be done. He merely asserts that Strato, Xenophon, and the ancient atheists as well as the Chinese Literati agree with Spi- noza "that there is no other Substance in the Universe but Matter, which Spinoza calls God, and Strato, Na- ture." 24 Collins's implied designation of Spinoza as a mnaterialist may suggest that Spinoza also may have been included in Shaftesbury's censure. This is more plausible than the opposite view of J. M. Robertson and some other modern readers that Shaftesbury's theory of a universal mind is of a piece with Spinoza's theory of God-Nature. Actually in the Augustan Age, Spinoza was regarded as a greater atheist than Hobbes. He is accused by Clarke of denying divine authorship of the world in the following interpretation of his system. That, since 'tis absolute'ly impossible for any thing to be created or produced by another; and also absolutely impos- sible for God to have caused any thing to be in any respect different from what it now is; every thing that exists, must needs be so a Part of the Divine Substance, not as a Modi- fication caused in it by any Will or Good-Pleasure or Wis- dom in the whole, but as of Absolute Necessity in itself, with respect to the manner of the Existence of each Part, no less than with respect to the Self-existence of the whole.25 Whether Shaftesbury had Spinoza, Collins, or any other individuals in mind, there is no doubt that he is ridiculing all forms of materialism, which he describes as atheistic faith. In contrast he recapitulates the arti- cles of theistic faith; that his own self is "a real self, drawn out and copied from another principal and origi- nal self (the Great One of the world)"; that "as there is 22 The true intellectual system of the universe 1: 207, N. Y., 1837. Much of Day's Free thoughts is devoted to an attack on revived hylozoism. 23An exact parallel to Shaftesbury's comparison of the two mechanistic philosophies is found in Gildon's Deist's manual (1705), the condemning of the theory of the eternity of the world probably being provoked by Section 16 of Blount's Ora- cles of reason.

AMER. PHIL. SOC. one general mass, one body of the whole, so to this body there is an order, to this order, a mind; that to the gen- eral mind each particular one must have relation, as being of like substance"; and that "the particular mind should seek its happiness in conformity with the general one, and endeavour to resemble it in its highest simplic- ity and excellence."26 The uniting principle, as it is the clearest proof of the existence of an intelligence in the universe, is likewise the best proof of its goodness. Shaftesbury has a further use for the uniting princi- ple on the human level as an argument against suicide. To Philocles, who declares that since good is unobtain- able in this life, our best policy is to end our existence, Theocles replies that we need first to know in what our self consists and to prove that it cannot be concerned with anything hereafter. To do this, we must decide against pre-existence and find a better argument against it than that "we remember not, nor are conscious."'2 There are many things in which we have been con- cerned of which we flow have no memory, and for all we know we may continue existing and forgetting to perpetuity. "We are no more the self-same matter or system of matter from one day to another," and we have no guarantee that our interest will end with the dis- solving of certain particles or a particular form. Since we have no idea how chance or providence may dispose of us, we cannot be sure of making a good exchange by voluntarily departing this life. Shaftesbury recurs to the problem of identity in Mis- cellaneous Reflections, where he rid,icules the solution of Descartes, but offers no alternative theory of his own. According to Shaftesbury, the seeming logic of the phrase, "WAe tlhink: therefore we are," tells us no more than "If I am: I am." 28 The real question is what constitutes the we or I and "whether the I of this in- stant, be the same with that of any instant preceding, or to come." Paraphrasing Locke once more, he as- serts that we have only memory as a criterion, avid memory may be false. We may take for reality that which is only dream and be conscious of a past dream which actually never took place.29 This is what metaphysicians mean when they say "that identity can be proved only by consciousness, but that con- sciousness, withal, may be as well false as real in respect of what is past." To all this metaphysical reasoning, Shaftesbury adds merely that he will take his being upon trust, that he will act as resolutely on the assumption that he exists as if he "had effectually proved it a thousand times, to the full satisfaction of our metaphysical or Pyrrhonean antagonist." In the 1711 edition of A4n Inquiry is a passage not in the 1699 version concerning the hypothesis that exist- 26 Robertson, 2: 105-106. 27 Ibid. 2: 35. 28Ibid. 2: 275. 29Essay, Bk. II, Chap. XXVII. ence is merely a dream. Even though we adopt an ex- treme form of scepticism by doubting the world of objects around us, we cannot doubt as to what passes within ourselves. Our passions and affections are knowni to us. Thev are certain, whatever the objects may be on which they are employed. Nor is it of any concern to our argument how these exterior objects stand: whether they are realities or mere illusions; whether we wake or dream. For ill dreams will be equally disturbing; and a good dream (if life be nothing else) will be easily and happily passed. In this dream of life, therefore, our demonstrations have the same force.30 This passage may be merely a further illustration of Shaftesbury's concern with the problem of identity or it may mean that something had occurred between 1699 and 1711 to bring to his attention philosophical ideal- ism; this may have been the publication of Berkeley's Principles of Human Kntowledge in 1710. Shaftesbury's common sense attitude toward personal identity was adopted by Butler in a review of the prob- lem although he did not stress the uniting principle as the clearest and best proof of a good and intelligent force in the universe.31 The final step in the complete vindication of provi- dence in The Moralists is the argument that if in the mighty union of the universe there seem to be any- parts which are not properly ordered, it is because our finite minds cannot comprehend the immensity of the scheme. Evil may seem to exist, but it is evil only in appearance. On a minor scale this may be illustrated by the un- learned man, who sees no relevance in the dissected parts of a plant or animal, in contrast to the scientist, who understands the relation of every part to the whole -or by a landsman entirely ignorant of navigation, who, placed on a sailing-vessel in calm weather, would perceive the order and unity of the decks and every- thing below, but "being ignorant of the intent or de- sign of all above, would . . . pronounce the masts and cordage to be useless and cumbersome, and for this reason condemn the frame and despise the architect." 32 Theocles warns us to consider the complexity of the universe into which we can have but little insight and of which we cannot know the ends and purposes. Wheni we once recognize the uniform, consistent fabric and own the universal system, he affirms, "we must of a consequence acknowledge a universal mind." If, in a lonely desert, we were to hear a perfect symphony or 30 R-obertson, 1: 336-337. 31 See "Dissertation I" appended to The analogy of religion. Thomas Rundle, a contemporary of Butler's, held a much less favorable view of Shaftesbury's understanding of the subject, observing, "He had also the misfortune to live before the Phi- losophy of Person was generally known; and Des Cartes, whom he unhappily studied, perplexed him with cob-web metaphysics, and made him puzzle himself, though he will not his readers."

In the universe everything dem- onstrates order and perfection, "all is delightful, ami- able, rejoicing," with one exception, man! His unequal moral state seems to indicate that defects exist, but this apparent difficulty, as we have seen above, is resoived by demonstrating the triumph of virtue over vice. A greater difficulty than man's moral deformities, however, is his physical limitations. Plhilocles suggests that there is a flaw in the scheme of things because of man's impotence, his susceptibility to disease, and his dependence upon artificial means for supplying his wants.33 Theocles in reply reduces all these objections to the single principle that man lacks the physical ad- vantages of other animals and illustrates it with the possession or non-possession of wings. He points out that the whole structure of flying creatures is sub- servient to the wing and that other parts are diminished accordingly. The bodily structure of man, on the other hand, is manifestly unfitted for wings, and were he given them, his other parts, including the brain, would suffer. Man would then cease to be man, and his state would be less desirable than it is now. Bal- ance is the key to the anatomy of a species as well as to the structure of the entire universe. If man lacks the physical advantages of some animals, he possesses greater powers of reason, a vastly preferable quality. Animals have instincts, men reason. Both show the order of nature. Although in his "Philosophical Regi- men" Shaftesbury bases an almost identical discussion on a principle of Epictetus, in his reasoning he is follow- ing very closely Locke's exposition of why God did not endow mankind with "microscopical eyes." 3 Lest his readers remain unconvinced, Shaftesbury has Philocles assert in a subsequent passage that he is will- ing to accept the proofs of order in the universe, but that he is still not satisfied with the demonstration that evil in the universe is evil in appearance only.35 The- ocles therefore reviews the whole argument, beginning with a principle, to which Philocles assents, that "in an infinity of things, mutually relative, a mind which sees not infinitely, can see nothing fully; and must therefore frequently see that as imperfect, which in it- self is really perfect." The burden of proof, Theocles continues, rests on the one who charges the appearance of evil to be more than appearances, and for him to de- mand proof of the opposite is to demand that his an- tagonist be infinite, for "nothing beside what is infinite can see infinite connections." In spite of this admitted grandeur of the undertaking, Theocles does essay dem- onstration. Getting Philocles to admit that the appear- ances of ill may possibly be appearances alone and that all may be conducive to the interest of a universal One, Theocles asserts that if it may be so, it follows that it 33Ibid. 2: 72 ff. 34 Rand, Life, 184-185; Locke, Essay, Bk. II, Chap. XXIII. 35Robertson, 2: 108. must be so. If we once grant a self-principle in the whole, it is obvious that "whatever is possible in the whole, the nature or mind of the whole will put into execution for the whole's good: and if it be possible to exclude ill, it will exclude it." Since it is possible to exclude ill, notwithstanding the appearances, it must therefore be excluded. The lack of logic here is that Philocles did not grant that it was possible for the uni- versal mind to exclude ill; with his finite knowledge he had no way of knowing. Philocles merely granted, from recognition of this limited knowledge, that what seemed ill to him might in actuality be not ill. In other words, only the conceivable possibility, not the actual possibil- ity, has been admitted. There is a slightly better showing of logic in Theocles' disposal of the Manichean hypothesis. If there are two or more principles in nature, he says, either they must agree or not. If not, all must be confusion until one predominates. If they agree, the agreement must be reached through natural reason, not by chance, by "some particular design, contrivance, or thought: which brings us up again to ONE principle, and makes the other two to be subordinate." At this stage Theocles begins his rhapsodies in good earnest, lavishly praising the divine mind in almost ev- ery aspect of the universe. He opens with a lyrical version of the chain of being theme, later made even more familiar by Pope, Thomson, and Akenside. The sole animating and inspiring power of the universe moves everything in nature according to "sacred and inviolable laws, framed for the good of each particular being; as best may suit with the perfection, life and vigor of the whole." The vital principle is widespread. All lives, and by succession still revives. The temporary beings quit their borrowed forms and yield their elementary substance to new-comers. . . . New forms arise, and wheni the old dissolve, the matter whence they were composed is not left useless, but wrought with equal management and art, even in corruption, Nature's seeming waste and vile abhorrence.36 We shall never fully perceive the wonders of nature, Theocles continues, because of the difficulties of compre- hending matter, motion, time, space, sense, and thought. Thinking of the metaphysical difficulties inherent in such controversies as that of Collins and Clarke over identity and the mechanics of thought, he observes that we labor in vain "to understand that principle of sense and thought, which seeming in us to depend so much on motion, yet differs so much from it, and from matter itself, as not to suffer us to conceive how thought can more result from this, than this arise from thought." Despite his critical attitude toward Descartes' epistemo- logical formula and his theories of animal insensibility, Shaftesbury continues with a statement concerning the efficacy of thought, strongly reminiscent of Descartes' attempt to establish his own existence. Thought, lhe asserts. 36Ibid. 2: 110.</page><page sequence="35">330 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. we own pre-eminent, and confess the realest of beiings, the only existence of which we are made sure by being con- scious. All else may be only dream and shadow. All which even sense suggests may be deceitful. The sense itself remains still; reason subsists, and thought maintains its eldership of being.37 Shaftesbury's attitude toward Descartes is very much like his attitude toward Locke, a surface denunciation concealing a partial discipleship.38 Descartes used his rationalism to establish a mechanistic universe. Shaftes- bury loosely followed his method to establish a theistic universe. As Philocles says, he will make the world a machine, if you allow a mind.39 From the subject of his own thought, Theocles pro- gresses to the original and eternally existent thought whence we derive our own. And thus the assurance we have of the existence of beings above our sense and of thee (the great exemplar of thy works) comes from thee, the all true and perfect, who hast thus communicated thyself more immediately to us, so as in some manner to inhabit within our souls, thou who art original soul, diffusive, vital in all, inspiriting the whole.40 Theocles' rhapsody continues with paeans to the sun, planets, and stellar systems and with glowing accounts of the benefits to man from the earth, minerals, air, water, and light. These he follows with vivid descrip- tions of the extremes of the arctic and tropic regions, descriptions in which, unlike the similar passages in Lucretius, the pleasant and benevolent aspects of nature are stressed. If beasts and men are confined in arctic 37Ibid. 2: 112. 38 For ridicule of Cartesian psychology see Robertson, 1: 191, and for his epistemology see 2: 275. Only a passing reference is made to the theory of animal insensibility in the Character- istics (2: 287), but in Second characters, Shaftesbury speaks of "those philosophers (modern) the poorest and most shifting, for the sake of a system, hypothesis, who, surpassing all ancient conceits and extravagances of the kind, deny ideas, sense per- ception, (i.e. life) to animals." Benjamin Rand, ed., 105-107, London, 1914. A comparison of the philosophies of Descartes and Shaftesbury is given in K. Heinrich Von Stein's Die Ent- stehung der Neueren Asthetik, 160 ff., Stuttgart, 1886. For ridicule of Locke's theory that morality depends on the will of God see Robertson, 1: 264 and 1: 193; of his credibility in accepting travelers' tales, 1: 223; of his obscure language, 1: 302; and of the purpose and scope of his entire essay, 1: 193- 195. Among passages presumably influenced by Locke are those concerning the identity of a tree, 2: 100, the existence of God, 2: 69-70, and the physical limitations of man, 2: 73-74. Much of Shaftesbury's thought concerning the natural social instincts in man and animals which he used against the theories of Hobbes is also derived from Locke. Shaftesbury's extreme criticism of his former tutor may have been due to a subcon- scious recognition of his heavy indebtedness and a desire to as- sert his independence and originality by emphasizing points of difference. Beyond this, Shaftesbury was undoubtedly sincerely opposed to much of Locke's philosophy because of the com- pletely different streams of thought he absorbed through the stoic and Platonic traditions. For other references to Locke see Rand, ed., Life, 326, 344, 402, 414, 416; Rand, ed., Second characters, 105-107 177-178. 39 Robertson, 2: 93. 40Ibid. 2: 112. regions by raging cold, the kind, compensating gifts of heaven bring them timely relief. If the scorching sun of the tropical regions confounds weak-sighted mortals, breathing air which cannot abate the fire in their burn- ing breasts, the bounteous creator sends at last the re- freshments of night and gentle gales. The elephant, the silkworm, the camel, the mionstrous crocodile all have their uses, their peculiar beauties and their place in the structure of Shaftesbury's vindication of providence. In these lush nature hymns,Theocles blends the themes of unity and the illusory nature of evil. Unable to declare the use or service of all things in this universe, we are yet assured of the perfection of all, and of the justice of that economy to which all things are sub- servient, and in respect of which things seemingly deformed are amiable, disorder becomes regular, corruption whole- some, and poisons (such as these we have seen) prove heal- ing and beneficial.41 No doubt Shaftesbury felt that just as people who may in plain characters "read divinity from so many bright parts of the earth, choose rather those obscurer places, to spell out that mysterious being, which to our eyes appears at best under a veil of cloud" so to his readers the veil of rhapsody may appeal as a contrast to the straightforward prose of An Inquiry. V. VIRTUOSOSHIP The bloom of nectar'd fruitage ripe to sense, And every charm of animated things, Are only pledges of a state sincere, Th'integrity and order of their frame, When all is well within, and every end Accomplish'd. Thus was beauty sent from heav'n, The lovely ministress of truth and good In this dark world: for truth and good are one, And beauty dwells in them, and they in her, With like participation. -Mark Akenside, The Pleasures of Imagination. Throughout Shaftesbury's justification of providence the view is stressed that the universe is a unified organ- ism of beauty as well as order. By means of both the rhapsodic and formal sections of the Characteristics, Shaftesbury erects a philosophic system from which es- thetic values are inseparable and subordinate only to ethics, if subordinate at all. In this system he laid the groundwork for English formal esthetics. The general theoretical basis of Shaftesbury's esthet- ics may be considered under the term virtuosoship, a term commonly associated with Shaftesbury in English literature. It is used in a favorable sense to indicate interest or proficiency in the arts based on a broad moral and philosophical understanding, and in a disparaging sense to indicate pedantry, trivial undertakings, and artistic affectation. In the broadest meaning of the word, in which moral and esthetic concepts are united, "everyone is a virtuoso, of a higher or lower degree." The concepts of ethics and esthetics are not mutually 41 Ibid. 2: 122.</page><page sequence="36">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 19511 VIRTUOSOSHIP 331 exclusive in Shaftesbury's system, for he speaks of the "beauty of virtue" and regards beauty as "the original of all which is good." Since separate categories are generally accepted in philosophical discussion, however, the terms "ethics" and "esthetics" will be used through- out this chapter in their usually-accepted senses, but with no suggestion that Shaftesbury makes a distinction between the two. In previous chapters we have seen Shaftesbury's defense of the moral nature of man, his sympathetic portrayal of enthusiasm, and his vindication of the providence of the universe. When these concepts are combined with Platonic assumptions of absolute good and beauty, they form a distinctive system of esthetics. On the surface, questions of esthetics may seem of minor importance or even irrelevant to deism, but with Shaftesbury, esthetic considerations are of fundamental importance. In his system, God, is necessary to beauty, and beauty is necessary to God. The concepts of uni- versal order and beauty are inseparable. The following broad principles are found in Shaftes- bury's esthetics. Truth, good, and beauty, which are in essence the same, are discovered by a moral sense which is inherent and universal. We receive only an initial insight or prepossession by moral sense, however, and must attain a deeper understanding of the founda- tions of beauty and truth through the development of taste. The foundations of beauty are absolute, and taste is thus based on a universal standard, not upon individual whim. Beauty is equivalent to order and harmony, and consists of form, not matter. It is not the object of sense, but of the mind. The elements in the universe, physical and spiritual, may be arranged in a scale according to their degree of pure form or mind, a scale at the pinnacle of which exists the "first beauty" or original mind. We perceive beauty in proportion to our ascent of this scale through intellectual development. Most critics would agree that this is the essence of Shaftesbury's esthetic system. The difficulty is found in deciding exactly what these principles mean, for they are subject to several interpretations, especially the con- cepts that beauty is mental and that through it we gain access to the original beauty. Critics with a mystical bent may use these principles to interpret Shaftesbury's esthetics as a type of Plotinian mysticism. This is the way of two of Shaftesbury's German critics, C. F. Weiser, author of the most thorough study of Shaftes- bury, who supports his interpretation with dozens of references to Plotinus, and Ernst Cassirer, who has more recently continued the process without the lavish references.' The basis of the mystical interpretation is Shaftesbury's phrase, "the beautifying, not the beauti- fied is the really beautiful," which serves to associate Shaftesbury with Plotinus. After this initial step has been taken, the rest of Shaftesbury's system is drawn 1 C. F. Weiser, Shaftesbury und das Deutsche Geistesleben, Leipzig, B. G. Teubner, 1916; Ernst Cassirer, Die Philosophie der Aufkldrung, Tiibingen, 1932. upon to support a theory of intuitive understanding of the "inner form" of creation which reconciles the ap- parent opposition between the one and the many. Ac- cording to this interpretation, Shaftesbury does not view esthetics exclusively from the point of view of a work of art, but seeks from it the answer to the question of pure life-form. He teaches that beauty, which is pure form, is not perceived by the senses, but by pure con- templation. This intuitive perception, which is the basis of all artistic enjoyment and artistic creation, gives rise to a Promethean identification with the forming power and makes accessible to us the true divinity of mankind and with it and through it the divinity of all. Shaftesbury does not, according to Cassirer, like the classical estheticians, seek to define a work of art by establishing rules comparable to logical definitions, nor, like the empiricists, seek to discover the total psycho- logical effect of a work of art upon the one perceiving it. Instead he views the perception of beauty as the turning from the world of the created to the world of the creating, from the universe as a concept of objective reality to the motivating forces which have formed it and hold it together. According to Cassirer's inter- pretation, the seeker of beauty by recognizing "inner form" perceives the secret of nature and the physical world, and becomes a "second maker under Jove" as he observes and comprehends divine being. This is the process of creation or artistic "genius." Another quite different interpretation of these same principles is that they represent the stoic ideal of the conformity of the individual to the design and order of the world system. According to this interpretation, systematically presented by Esther Tiffany, moral sense gives us a basic proclivity toward good and beauty, but this native tendency must be perfected through the de- velopment of right taste, which is equivalent to regula- tion of opinions and passions by reason.2 As we remove ourselves from the influence of opinion through the de- velopment of the rational faculty, we perceive the good- ness of the universe and live in perfect harmony with the whole. Historically, Shaftesbury has been associated with a series of writers, including Francis Hutcheson, Adam Smith, David Hume, Adam Ferguson, and Lord Kames, who regarded him as the initiator of a trend in philoso- phy, of which they were part, to consider morality in general as deriving its existence from a taste, sentiment, or feeling of the beauty of virtue and the deformity of vice. A writer's contemporaries or near-contemporaries have the greatest familiarity with his language and in- tellectual milieu and are in the best position to interpret his meaning; hence the cumulative evidence of a long series of subsequent writers who acquiesce in an original interpretation is a good indication of the soundness of that interpretation. It is, on the other hand, possible for a stream of writers to Dernetuate zross errnrs or 2 Shaftesbury as Stoic, Publ. Mod. Lang.

The weakness of critical studies by contem- poraries is that they are likely to be written without adequate investigation and that they may be based on incomplete evidence. The intellectual brilliance and achievement of Shaftesbury's followers, however, is a sufficient warrant for accepting their interpretation of his esthetics as a system of sentiment. Esther Tiffany's interpretation is probably based on a more painstaking search into the Characteristics than most made in the eighteenth century and is based as well upon Shaftesbury's journals and upon a projected supplement to the Characteristics, material not pub- lished until this century. Her interpretation depends upon seeing in Shaftesbury's concepts a background of stoic philosophy and discovering verbal echoes of stoic philosophers. Cassirer's interpretation depends upon seeing in Shaftesbury's concepts a background of Plo- tinian and neo-Platonic philosophy and vesting Shaftes- bury's phrases with the meanings they would have in a Plotinian system. The former interpretation is valid because it is supported by obvious parallels in meaning and language in the Characteristics, by numerous ref- erences to the Stoics, and by the whole tenor of Shaftes- bury's journal, which is essentially a restatement of stoic ideals, digested for Shaftesbury's personal use. The latter interpretation is not valid because it is based on pure conjecture and cannot be supported by any occult allusions nor indeed by a single mention of Plotinus in either the Characteristics or Shaftesbury's other works. It finds in Shaftesbury an esoteric esthetic requiring more mysticism than any of the Christian mysteries. It is true that there are neo-Platonic ideas in the Characteristics, especially in the vindication of providence in The Moralists, but there is no warrant to carry over these purely teleological concepts to the esthetic process. Although Shaftesbury declares for the existence of innate ideas, it must not be forgotten that there is a good mixture of Toland with his Plato. The definitive statement of Shaftesbury's purpose in writing the Chiaracteristics is the author's own-"to as- sert the reality of a beauty and charm in moral as well as natural subjects; and to demonstrate the reasonable- ness of a proportionate taste, and determinate choice, in life and manners." In this statement, which brings together the good and the beautiful, there is nothing that can be considered esthetic in the narrow sense, for it concerns only conduct. We shall see that the esthetic elements which appear in the Characteristics are intro- duced primarily to support an ethical theory. Shaftes- bury's first published work, a preface to Whichcote's sermons, was entirely moral, and so was his first inde- pendent work, An Inquiry. Here he introduces beauty by way of analogy with the good primarily to give added weight to his moral theory. The mind, he says, per- ceives moral beauty and deformity in exactly the same manner in which it perceives the foul and fair or the harmonious and dissonant in music or art.3 Similarly 3 Robertson, 1: 251. in Seusus Conutnuntis', he asserts that the beauties of poetic art are inspired by "moral magic," that their art is an expression of inner harmony and numbers.4 This he follows with the observation that "the most natural beauty in the world is honesty, and moral truth." The actual identification occurs in The Moralists, where the statement is made that beauty and good are "one and the same," 5and the locus classicus is the statement in Miscellaneous Reflectiotts that "what is beautiful is harmonious and proportionable; what is harmonious and proportionable, is true; and what is at once both beautiful and true, is, of consequence, agree- able and good." 6 In the notes to this passage Shaftes- bury clearly shows, however, that he regards the quest for beauty as decidedly beneath the quest for virtue, or esthetic considerations as secondary to ethical. In connection with the concept of moral beauty, it is customary to think primarily of Plato and the Cam- bridge Platonists. Although Shaftesbury was undoubt- edly acquainted with these writers and used them in his own work, it is important to realize that they were not necessarily sources of his tlheories of moral beauty. John Maxwell in an essay appended to his edition of Cumberland's Law of Nature, 1727, illustrates the con- cept "that Good, to which the Law of Nature insti- tuteth, is the Beauteous-Beneficial" by giving a number of quotations from classical sources without mentioning Plato, Plotinus, or the Cambridge Platonists. Since he crowns his series of illustrations, most of which are drawn from Cicero and Seneca, with three pages of quotations from the Characteristics, it is logical to as- sume,that he is placing Slhaftesbury among a group of writers whom he assumed to be identified with the concept and most closely associated with Shaftesbury. The absence of the Platonists shows that for Maxwell at least, the identification of beauty and good was a familiar doctrine not dependent upon Platonism. In reading Maxwell, it will be noticed that he is concerned with the beauteous-beneficial instead of merely the beau- teous-a concern which Shaftesbury shared. Shaftes- bury makes the definite statement that "beauty and truth are plainly joined with the notion of utility and convenience," a stoic rather than Platonic emphasis.7 A good part of the Characteristics is a polemic against the ethics of Hobbes and the epistemology of Locke, the latter of whom, Shaftesbury felt, had delivered the "home blow" against morals by basing all ideas of vir- tue and order upon opinion.8 In general, it may be said that the concept of moral sense as the prolocutor of the benevolent affections is directed against Hobbes and that the concept of innate ideas as inherent knowl- edge is directed against Locke. Unfortunately, Shaftes- bury does not keep the two concepts separate, but al- 4Ibid. 1: 91. 5Ibid. 2: 128; see also 2: 141. 6Ibid. 2: 268; see also 2: 344. 7Ibid. 2: 267. 8 Rand, Life, 403.</page><page sequence="38">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 19511 VIRTUOSOSHIP 333 lows them to merge indiscriminately. In his index Shaftesbury lists a number of passages under "Moral sense" and others under "Ideas innate," but by cross- references in the notes he practically identifies the two concepts. It is impossible to extract a precise and com- prehensive definition of moral sense from the Character- istics, for the concept changes character according to Shaftesbury's forensic needs. If the concept could be limited to affection alone, it would have more validity than it has when encumbered with the concept of in- nate knowledge. In a passage specifically aimed at Locke in Advice to an Author, moral sense is equivalent to following a natural scheme of life uncorrupted by vice. Shaftes- bury assumes that all virtues are natural and all vices are unnatural in opposition to the view that "all actions are naturally indifferent." If nature is taken in a physiological sense, there is little doubt that whatever is natural is right and whatever is unnatural is wrong, and the moral sense as purely natural inclination is an unerring guide to virtue. In a somewhat broader sense, Shaftesbury uses af- fection to refer to social instincts, ranging from the procreation and care of offspring to love of the clan, the country, and the public.9 In a still broader sense the natural affections are made to include love to one's kind, courage, gratitude, and pity.10 Here a sense of right and wrong consists in the addition of a reflecting faculty to these natural affections. The primary purpose of Sensus Communis is to de- velop this concept of social instincts. Its title means a sense of community interest rather than the generally- accepted meaning of prudent judgment. Shaftesbury points out that most men have a strong faith in what they regard as the opinion and judgment of the gen- erality of mankind, but that when a careful survey is made no such thing as a common accord is to be found. In two subjects of utmost concern to mankind, religion and politics, it is obvious that sectarian and national variations create countless differences in opinion, and in morals the differences are still wider, some of the most admired modern philosophers having maintained "that virtue and vice had, after all, no other law or measure, than mere fashion and vogue." 11 Although this is an attack on Locke, and Shaftesbury is an avowed enemy to philosophers of this school, he is equally op- posed to the concept of generally-received opinion as an arbiter of right, and temporarily leaves his readers with a sceptical note, promising to reveal later some assur- ance of the stability of things. In a subsequent section, he supplants his scepticism with the statement that com- mon sense refers to the heart, not the head, a notion which he supports by extensive references to classic authors and their commentators.12 In this use of the 9 Robertson, 1: 74. 10 Ibid. 1: 266. "Ibid. 1: 56. 12Ibid. 1: 69-71; see also 2: 288-289. term, it signifies a "sense of public weal, and of the common interest; love of the community or society, natural affection, humanity, obligingness, or that sort of civility which rises from a just sense of the common rights of mankind, and the natural equality there is amongst those of the same species." There is notlhing said specifically here about the source of this community spirit, but it is here implied that it is innate. Shaftesbury appears at his weakest when he attempts to defend his theory of preconceptions by enlisting the passions, including anger, shame, and pride, as evi- dences of a sense of moral beauty and deformity. Ac- cording to this reasoning, the passions of anger and resentment are founded on "a sense of wrong, natural to all men, and a desire to prosecute that wrong at any rate." 13 They are not impelled bv selfish interests, "but out of hatred to the imagined wrong, and from a certain love of justice, which even in unjust men is . . . shown to be beyond the love of life itself." Pride is founded on a sense of worth, honor or merit, whether the quality be actually present or fancied, and shame im- plies a sense of what is mean or odious. Thus, Shaftes- bury's spokesman asserts, "as long as I find men either angry or revengeful, proud or ashamed, I am safe: for they conceive an honorable and dishonorable, a foul and fair, as well as I." Shaftesbury is not much given to paradoxes, but this one is fantastic enough to serve for a lifetime of writing. As the astute Jonathan Edwards observes, if anger were a result of a sense of moral beauty, a disposition toward anger would increase in proportion as a man develops sweetness and benevolence of temper, but in reality the opposite tendency prevails.14 No one will deny that passions are innate if they are limited to anger, fear, and love, and many psychologists extend the list to include various subdivisions includ- ing gratitude and pity. If Shaftesbury's moral sense went no further than this, as some of his disciples main- tain, it might be generally accepted, but actually Shaftes- bury declares for a theory of innate ideas of the kind which Locke opposed. In At Intquiry Shaftesbury as- serts the existence of a "common and natural sense of a sublime and beautiful in things" or an innate percep- tion of the beauty or deformity of actions as well as of the shape, motions, colors, and proportions of the ob- jects of sense.15 This sense of right and wrong, he de- clares, is "as natural to us as natural affection itself" and is "a first principle in our constitution and make." 16 In The Moralists Shaftesbury tries to place his theory on a physiological basis and takes the offensive against Locke. He prepares his readers by describing presensa- tion or instincts in animals, which give them perfect knowledge, entirely independent of experience, concern- ing the seasons of the year. the building of their habita- 13 Ibid. 2: 140-141. 14 Dissertation concernting the nature of true virtue. 15 Robertson, 1: 251. 16 Ibid. 1: 260.</page><page sequence="39">334 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. tions, and the rearing of their young.17 A few pages beyond he uses this evidence of presensation in animals to prove by analogy the existence of similar presensa- tions in human beings. The exact time of the entrance of sensations or principles into the body, he asserts, is a matter of small consequence. The question is whether they are from nature or not.'8 In order to support his conviction that they are from nature, Shaftesbury sug- gests that the word innate be changed to instinct, to be defined as "that which nature teaches, exclusive of art, culture or discipline." The bodily organs are formed by nature, and the instinct for their use is also from na- ture, not from learning and experience. The proof of this is seen in the various means of providing for the young among all species, the arts and labors "which demonstrate their anticipating fancies, preconceptions, or presensations." Among human beings no learning is necessary to recognize the elements of fleshly beauty, and the infant is pleased with the first view of a ball, a cube, or a dye. Finally, as there is an inherent sense of the beauty of figures, there is one as natural of ac- tions. As soon as actions, affections, and passions are discerned, "an inward eye distinguishes, and sees the fair and shapely, the amiable and admirable, apart fromn the deformed, the foul, the odious, or the despicable." The standard objection to all theories of absolute beauty or absolute good is that no agreement has ever existed in the human race concerning what is beautiful or good. Shaftesbury was aware of the perpetual vari- ance among men, "the one affirming, the other denying that this, or that, was fit or decent." 19 Shaftesbury's reply is essentially the same as Hutcheson's more formal presentation in 1725, which furnished the stock answers used throughout the century. All men agree concerning the basic standard of beauty; their differences enter only in its application. In Shaftesbury's words, "All own the standard, rule and measure: but in applying it to things, disorder arises, ignorance prevails, interest and passion breed disturbance." In An Inquiry, Shaftes- bury gives a slightly different explanation of diversities -that the inherent force of nature may be overcome by the contrary forces of custom and education.20 One of the important differences between Shaftes- bury's system and Hutcheson's is that Shaftesbury con- sidered the moral sense to operate in regard to both ethics and esthetics, but Hutcheson confined the moral sense to ethics and considered esthetics under a sepa- rate sense of beauty. To explain diversity in opinions of what is beautiful, Hutcheson compares the inner sense of beauty with the external senses, which every- one allows to be natural. There is as great a variety about the objects of the external senses, Hutcheson as- serts, as about the objects of beauty, and it is only be- caius wp have distinct names for the external senses 17Ibid. 2: 76. 18Ibid. 2: 135. 9 Ibid. 2: 137 ff. 20 Ibid. 1: 261. and none for the internal, that we are led to believe that the former are more fixed and real and natural than the latter. Hutcheson takes space to assert that internal senses no more presuppose innate ideas than do exter- nal, for "Both are natural Powers of Perception, or De- terminations of the Mind to receive necessary certain Ideas from the presence of Objects." One great cause of the apparent diversity of fancies in the sense of beauty as well as in the external senses is the associa- tion of ideas, which makes objects attractive or repellent for reasons entirely apart from their beauty or deform- ity.21 Another cause is the variation in tempers of men. Although men are generally disposed to benevolence and virtue, particular kinds of it may appeal most strongly to particular tempers, for example, courage to military men, and sweetness of temper to men of smaller cour- age.22 From this general principle Hutcheson extracts three specific grounds to explain the vast diversity of moral principles in various nations and ages. In dis- cussing the first ground, the different opinions of hap- piness or natural good and the means to advance it, Hutcheson asserts that the apparent cruelties practiced in remote places are founded on a desire to promote the public good, and he joins with Shaftesbury in scoffing at the absurdity of the monstrous taste in readers and writers of travels, who dwell on the strange and abnor- mal rather than on the evidences of natural affections and public good. The second ground of diversity in sentiments, the diversity of systems to which men con- fine their benevolence, is based on Shaftesbury's argu- ment that the various sects, parties, factions, cabals of mankind in larger societies are all brought together by a public spirit. The last ground of diversity, the false opinions of the will or laws of the deity, is obviously based on Shaftesbury's argument in An Inquiry con- cerning Virtue. In spite of Hutcheson's assertion that his sense of beauty does not presuppose innate ideas any more than do the external senses, his system and Shaftesbury's are not saved from the objections levelled against sys- tems of innate ideas. As Holbach has demonstrated against all systems of inner benevolence, our sentiments of good and evil are no more innate than our ideas of a circle or triangle. Shaftesbury's question of whether they arise from nature or art is beside the point. Hol- bach asserts that they come from experience and that we are able to grasp moral truths with about the same facility with which we perceive truths of physics or geometry. We distinguish between pleasure and pain, a circle and a triangle, or a praiseworthy action and a culpable action only by the diversity of effects that things produce within ourselves. Our sentiments can- not be disinterested, for we can applaud only that which pleases us. Holbach admits that every man is born with a desire for nourishment, which may be called an instinct, but only experience can teach him to distinguish 21 Inquiry into . . . Our Ideas of Beauty, Treatise 1, Sec. 6. 22 Ibid., Treatise 2, Sec. 6.</page><page sequence="40">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 19511 VIRTUOSOSHIP 335 between agreeable foods and those which are disagree- able or dangerous.23 As long as Shaftesbury means physiological needs or instincts when he is dealing with innate ideas, he is on sound ground, but when he speaks of sentiments or af- fections, he cannot prove that they are prior to experi- ence. Locke's doctrine that these are based upon opin- ion turned Shaftesbury against his tutor, but it is never- theless true. There is much even in the Characteristics which counts against the doctrine of natural affections. All of the evidence of the secular gentleman in Miscel- laneous Reflections on the multiplicity of opinion con- cerning religious beliefs and customs used as an argu- ment against revelation may be used against moral sense.24 Also there is as much space devoted in the Characteristics to the stoic and Platonic doctrine that the passions should be controlled by reason as there is to the apparently contradictory doctrine that moral sense should be in command. In fairness to Shaftes- bury, it should be pointed out that in An Inquiry, the treatise in which he formulated the doctrine of moral sense, he asserts that the natural affections and the un- natural affections operate concurrently and that happi- ness depends on the proper order or economy of the passions. Passions may be innate, but they also submit to regulation by reason. Also in some passages moral sense is seen to be at one with reason. Esther Tiffany has an interesting theory that the doctrine of instinctive perception of moral values was adopted by Shaftesbury primarily as a weapon to com- bat the views of churchmen and Hobbesists that right and wrong depend upon a standard arbitrarily imposed by an external authority. She points out that the doc- trine of innate sense is carefully formulated in An In- quiry, but that in the subsequent treatises it changes character because of various qualifications added to it so that in the end it becomes no more than "a blindly- held groping ideal." The theory itself, she asserts, is "so contrary to the main emphasis of Shaftesbury's teaching that the explanation of it makes him more trou- ble and involves him in more inconsistencies than almost any part of his philosophy." 25 The trouble with this hypothesis is that it does not take into account Shaftesbury's aversion to the ethi- cal implication of Locke's attack upon innate ideas. Shaftesbury opposed Locke, not because he created an arbitrary system of morals, but because he allegedly did just the opposite by grounding morality upon individual opinion. Nearly all of Shaftesbury's works, including his letters, reveal his opposition to Locke's relativism, and Shaftesbury's defence of innate perceptions appears in The Moralists and Miscellaneous Reflections as well as in An Inquiry. 23 System Social ou Principes Natitrels de la Morale 1: 76 ff., Londres, 1773. 24 Robertson, 2: 354 ff. 25 Op. cit., 664. If we associate the affections with passion and com- pletely ignore the matter of whether they are innate, or even assume that they are acquired, we are still going to perceive a contradiction in the Characteristics concerning the relative influence of passion and rea- son. In the seventeenth century, the basing of moral conduct almost exclusively upon reason was condemned by divines and moralists as "stoic insensibility," and as a counter-doctrine, anticipating Shaftesbury's moral sense, was stressed the salutary influence of the charita- ble affections and passions.26 These opposing doctrines are both found in the Characteristics. Although the vindication of the affections was re- garded as an anti-stoic doctrine, actually it may be found in modified form, as Esther Tiffany has pointed out, in the works of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. Epictetus states that we come into the world with innate concepts of good and evil and of the appropriate and inappropri- ate. Then through experience and education we learn to apply these ideas or preconceptions of the rational and irrational to the problems of life. This is the es- sence of Shaftesbury's teaching on the moral sense and the key to the only possible means of reconciling his con- trary doctrines of affection and reason, the latter of which will be discussed in the next few pages. The system of Epictetus is in general consistent because in it reason remains the single salutary motivating force, and the shadowy intellectual preconceptions are not considered beneficial until they are adapted by rea- son. Shaftesbury, however, may be accused of confu- sion because the natural affections in his system are considered as vital motivating influences upon conduct. It is obvious that both passion and reason may and do operate concurrently in most human beings and that no system can be valid which fails to take both into account. The question is not psychological, however, concerning the fact of the operation of reason and pas- sion, but moral, concerning which of the two should be allowed to dominate or control. Taste and moral sense are not, as they may seem to be, similar ideas, but almost opposite, the latter based on affection, the former on reason. The qualifications attached to the theory of innate sense which are found in the last two treatises of the Characteristics convert Shaftesbury's esthetics from a system of simple intuitive perception to a system of complex intellectual perception based upon the development of a right taste for a fixed standard of beauty. In Advice to an Author, Shaftesbury shows taste to be established on a standard in the nature of things; and in Miscellaneous Reflections he shows that this taste is not innate, but developed through discipline and train- ing. The concept of taste in the arts is not expressed for its own sake, but primarily to provide an analogy for developing the concept of a standard in moral con- duct. Although the arts, Shaftesbury says, are simply 26 R. S. Crane, Suggestions toward a genealogy of the man of feeling, E. L. H., Jour. English Lit. Hist. 1: 205-230, 1934.</page><page sequence="41">336 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. an imitation of outward grace and beauty, we "not only confess a taste, but make it a part of refined breeding to discover, amidst the many false manners and styles, the true and natural one, who represents the real beauty and Venus of the kind." 27 Similarly, in regard to hu- man beings there is a "foundation of a right and wrong taste" in "inward characters and features" as well as in "outw-ard person, behaviour and action." The artist cannot produce an adequate representation unless he fully understands the standard or measure of this inte- rior beauty. The sense of inward numbers, the practice of social virtues, and the favor of the moral graces are all essential to the poet or painter, and "the science of virtuosos, and that of virtue itself, become, in a manner, one and the same." The artist is nothing but a copier after nature in the above sense of a standard, and Na- ture's powerful decrees and instincts and inbred senti- ments reveal to us the discrepancies of an artist who defies nature in any way. Yet custom and fashion sometimes run contrary to nature, and the great task of the artist is deliberately to reform his taste according to her just standard. Vulgar taste is based upon whim and fashion, but just taste is based on nature and at- tained by the victory of the faculties of mind, wit, and judgment over the "territories of the heart."28 In other words, our taste is derived from natural instincts and affections which may be called innate, but is liable to corruption by fashion and custom or wantonness and humor, from which it may be redeemed only by the use of reason. In Miscellaneous Reflections, Shaftesbury clearly states that taste is not innate. Now a taste or judgment . . . can hardly come readly formed with us into the world. . . . Whatever good facul- ties, senses, or anticipating sensations, and imaginations, may be of nature's growth, and arise properly, of thenm- selves, without our Art, Promotion, or Assistance; the gen- eral idea which is formed of all this management, and the clear notion we attain of what is preferable and principal in all these subjects of choice and estimation, will not, as I imagine, by any person, be taken for innate. Use, prac- tice, and culture must precede the understanding and wit of such an advanced size and growth as this.29 Taste is more than merely the result of education and training. These may give us an opinion of what is good or beautiful, but reason alone will reveal reality to us. One of the most important of all stoic doctrines is this of the conquest of fancy or opinion by reason. It is expressed by Shaftesbury tersely and simply. We cre- ate, he says, our own taste, which may be either just or unjust. The method by which we may confirm in ourselves an opinion of good which will "secure to us an invariable, agreeable, and just taste in life and man- ners" is to search opinion, call in question our "early prepossessing taste" and recall our fancy "from the 27 Robertson, 1: 217. 28Ibid. 1: 229. 29 ibid. 2: 257. power of fashion and education, to that of reason." 3 A few pages subsequently Shaftesbury specifically re- lates this doctrine of the regulation of opinion to the moral sense and implies that moral sense itself must be subject to reason. After asserting the existence of an "imagination of something beautiful, great and becom- ing in things," which he identifies in the notes with moral sense, Shaftesbury asserts that this imagination may be foolishly as well as wisely applied, for example, to such subjects as material possessions and honors. When this occurs, the opinion of good is placed in the wrong subjects, and passions are raised which are in- capable of any real satisfaction. Our inner work miiust therefore be, in pure stoic terms, "to regulate fancy, and rectify opinion" by placing the opinion of good "where it is truest, in the affections or sentiments, in the gov- erning part and inward character." Essentially the same argument is found in The Mor- alists in a passage in which Shaftesbury describes the various and contrary pursuits of men; one valuing hero- ism, another prudence; one prizing commercial prowess, another debauchery. Even those who seek the same thing do so for different ends. One seeks wealth to indulge his palate, another to acquire popularity. Among the virtuosi, one admires music and art, an- other gardens and architecture. "All censure one an- other, and are despicable in one another's eyes [and] . . . by fits . . . are as despicable in their own . . . as their humour changes, and their passion turns from one thing to another." 31 Since there is no universal agreement concerning the manner in which riches are to be used or in what manner to be applied, Slhaftesbury concludes, "they are neither good in themselves, nor directly any cause or means of good," and the same con- sequence follows for fame and honor, pleasure and even life itself. By following nature or freeing ourselves from passions and low interests, however, we aclhieve moral independence of the goods which depend on for- tune, age, circumstances, and honor and attain the posi- tive, certain, and perpetual goods which are founded in virtue only and which we may bestow upon ourselves. The rule of life then is to match opinion with real good and pick out the false fancies from the true. Perhaps the main source of confusion in Shaftesbury's theory is that he does not explain the difference between fancies in stoical passages like the above and moral sense or natural affection in passages derived from ILati- tudinarian divines. To most eighteenth-century critics, Shaftesbury's main emphasis seemed to be on the salu- tary influence of moral sense. According to Hume's analysis, Shaftesbury, with some confusion, based his system on that of the ancients, who affirm that virtue is nothing but conformity to reason, but "in general seem to consider morals as deriving their existence from taste and sentiment," in contrast to the moderns, who affirm the beauty of virtue and the deformiiity of vice, but "in 30 Ibid. 2: 272. 31 Ibid. 2: 146.</page><page sequence="42">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 19511 VIRTUOSOSHIP 337 general try to explain these distinctions by abstract rea- soning and logical deductions." 32 Mandeville, also counting Shaftesbury as an advocate of sentiment, ob- jected that he taught that men could be virtuous without self-denial, "that men without any trouble or violence upon themselves may be naturally virtuous." 3 There is a passage in The Moralists, howevef, which teaches the contrary doctrine, that the difficulties in the way of virtues are what make them virtues, that there would be no merit if virtue met always with reward. Had the good and virtuous of mankind consistently triumphed without opposition, he asks, Where had the virtues had their theatre, or whence their- names ? . . . What merit, except from hardship? What virtue without a conflict, and the encounter of such enemies as arise both within, and from abroad? 34 This goes contrary to the basic principles of An Inquiry, for Mandeville is right in asserting that Shaftesbury teaches in the main that the natural affections are both pleasing and virtuous. Here is a difficulty which Shaftesbury did not resolve: if the natural affections are inherently pleasing, where do the trials come in? The answer from both Shaftesbury's principles and general experience is probably that some virtuous ac- tions may be entirely pleasing and others accompanied with pain or self-denial, but the greater degree of merit belongs to the latter group. Everything that Shaftesbury says on taste is based on the view that virtue consists in practicing self-control and in regulating opinion by the conscious exercise of the intellectual faculty. It is not really possible to rec- oncile the doctrines of affection and taste as they stand in the Cliaracteristics, but they may be rendered con- sistent if interpreted in the light of the "Philosophi- cal Regimen." In a section devoted to the passions, Shaftesbury places the affections on two different levels and teaches that we should follow passions in regard to society, but that we should be governed by reason alone in regard, to our moral character and in regard to the universe as a whole.

But in another order of life, in another species, and in respect of another, a higher relation, nothing can be more dissonant than this; nothing more inconsistent with that true affec- tion, which in a mind soundly rational is, as it were, in the place of all. To act by temper simply is, in such a one, the greatest degeneracy; a sinking down into a lower spe- cies of nature.35 In discussing natural affection, Shaftesbury makes a distinction between affection and passion. The latter, 32 An inquiry concerning the principles of mXorals, Sec. 1. 33 F. B. Kaye, ed., The Fable of the Bees 1: 33, Oxford, Clar- endon Press, 1924. 34 Robertson, 2: 58. 35 Rand, Life, 158-159. he says, is based on personal interests, on our fancy or opinion of what is good. The former is based on the design and will of nature and consists in a love entirely devoid of interest. True affection cannot exist without true liberty from the passions.36 Natural affection in the vulgar sense consists in merely being pleasantly dis- posed toward friends, relations, countrymen, or what- ever else is engaging or delightful. Natural affection in the true sense consists in being able to give up these pleasant relationships if providence should so decree, in regulating our will to "be in conformity to the supreme will, and ready to receive whatever happens and is ap- pointed." True affection means our complete control over the power of chance or circumstances to raise con- trary passions, and the complete subordination of our passions to the good of the whole. Shaftesbury's dis- tinction closely resembles the common seventeenth-cen- tury dichotomy of the active and the passive affections. All this may seem rather remote from esthetics, but it will be remembered that Shaftesbury's analogy be- tween art and virtue is largely a device to expedite the development of a moral theory. On purely estlhetic grounds, however, Shaftesbury clearly establishes the development of true taste upon rigorous training and use of reason. This is a phase of Shaftesbury's esthetics which Cassirer completely ignores in his theory of in- tuitive understanding. According to Shaftesbury, the perception of true beauty depends upon "the criticizing or examining art" and not upon direct intuition. The phrase which is of greatest importance in the metaphysical approach to Shaftesbury's esthetics is an inconspicuous line in The Moralists, "the beautifying, not the beautified, is the really beautiful." 3 Critics with a proclivity for the occult have found in this phrase an epitome of Plotinian thought, particularly the sen- tence in the seventh book of the sixth Ennead, "Even here we have to recognize that beauty is that which irra- diates symmetry rather than symmetry itself and is that which truly calls out our love." 38 Shaftesbury's phrase is based on the principles that beauty is found in form, not in matter, and that it is per- ceived by the mind, not by the senses. Both are rather academic concepts since it is difficult to separate form from matter or mind from sense except perhaps in the conceiving of mathematical relations or in memory. It is granted, of course, that one element may be empha- sized more than the other; in design, for example, line may be stressed at the expense of color. Shaftesbury establishes the principle that beauty is found in form by means of an illustration. A beautiful metal statue is admired, not for the metal or matter of which it is made, but for the art's sake. Beauty, therefore, is something entirely independent of body, and this must of necessity e niinrl 36 Ibid., 2 ff. 38 Stephen Mackenna, Plotinuts 5: 189, London, Medici Soci- ety, 1930.</page><page sequence="43">338 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. The beautiful, the fair, the comely, were never in the mat- ter, but in the art and design; never in body itself, but in the form or forming power. . . . What is it but the design which strikes? What is it you admire but mind, or the effect of mind? 'This mind alone which forms. All which is void of mind is horrid: and matter formless is deforming itself.89 The word design is significant in the interpretation of this passage. One of the principal aims of the whole Characteristics is to prove the existence of moral de- sign in the universe, and one of the methods of demon- stration is to draw an analogy between morality and esthetics. This passage is one phase of the analogy; beauty in artistic objects consists in their order and design as the beauty of the universe consists in its moral design. In this passage, mind is considered as the only form- ing power, and in a subsequent passage all perception of beauty is limited to mind. Shaftesbury's attempt to prove that the enjoyment of beauty is mental and that beauty may not be the object of sense rests almost en- tirely on the manipulation of words.40 Whatever is clearly based upon sense perceptions, Shaftesbury in- sists is something other than beauty; whatever may be attributed to mental activity, Shaftesbury claims for beauty. He will admit no element of the perception of beauty in sexual attraction. By making good use of connotation, he persuades us that sexual attraction is hunger, not love, and compares this appetite with the one for food. We do not apply the notion of beauty to fruits and vegetables on the table although we find them beautiful when growing in the garden or the field. The method of argument here seems to be to confuse all senses with the gustatory sense, and by showing that the pleasures of the table are entirely physical, to per- suade us that the pleasure from sight is entirely mental. Shaftesbury points out, nevertheless, that seeing may be just as "low" as taste if it is not in the service of pure contemplative devotion. Although the theory of the contemplation of the forms is rather nebulous, it leads to a concrete esthetic principle, that beauty can- not be perceived without contemplation and rational examination. Animals in a field of clover, for example, do not enjoy the beauty of their surroundings, for it is not the form, but the savor beneath it which attracts. Likewise among human beings, "thirst better allayed by the clear brook than the thick puddle, makes the fair nymph to be preferred, whose form is otherwise slighted." In other words, attraction toward the physi- cal charms of feminine beauty does not necessarily im- ply esthetic appreciation, an observation which may be true, "for never can the form be of real force where it is uncontemplated, unjudged of, unexamined, and stands only as the accidental note or token of what appeases provoked sense, and satisfies the brutish part." There is apparent disagreement between Shaftesbury 39 Robertson, 2: 132. 40 Ibid. 2: 141 ff. and Hutcheson in regard to the rational element in the perception of beauty, for Hutcheson affirms that the pleasure of perception does not arise from any Knowledge of Principles, Propor- tions, Causes, or of the Usefulness of the Object; but strikes us at first with the Idea of Beauty: nor does the most accurate Knowledge increase this Pleasure of Beauty., however it may super-add a distinct rational Pleasure from prospects of Advantage, or from the Increase of Knowledge.41 According to Hutcheson, beauty and harmony are per- ceived by an internal sense, the responses of which are necessary and immediate, like those of the external senses. The external senses enable us merely to tell one color from another, to distinguish the higher from the lower in musical notes, or discern the proportions of solid figures. The internal sense of beauty, however, gives us the pleasure we attain from music, painting, or architecture. The poet, for example, has a far richer perception of the natural beauty of a landscape by means of his internal sense than has an expert on agriculture or botany. Shaftesbury and Hutcheson agree concerning the ex- tra-sensory nature of the process of perceiving beauty; they differ merely concerning the rational element in- volved. Hutcheson assumes that the perceptions are direct and immediate, entirely independent of reason; whereas Shaftesbury affirms that the complete process requires the agency of reason. Hutcheson, therefore, is much closer to pure sentiment than is Shaftesbury, who goes so far as to say that the perception of beauty is entirely rational. There is nothing so divine as beauty, which belonging not to body, nor having any principle or existence except in mind and reason, is alone discovered and acquired by this diviner part, when it inspects itself, the only object worthv of itself.42 In this passage Shaftesbury may not be using mind and reason in the sense of a logical process of contemplation, examination, and judgment, but merely as general terms to express extra-sensory perception. Hutcheson's ex- planation of internal sense is an expansion of the thought of this passage although it fails to provide com- plete understanding because it does not include the concept that mind is both perceiver and object perceived. If taken literally, the statement that the mind can find beauty only by perceiving mind is obviously contrary to experience. It must, therefore, be interpreted. The simplest view is that of Bernard Bosanquet, that "the content of reason which beauty embodies for sense did not signify for Shaftesbury anything more than the formal principle of antiquity-the principle of unity in multiplicity."43 This interpretation would hold for Hutcheson, for the formula of uniformity amidst variety 41 Op. cit., Treatise I, Sec. I. 42 Robertson, 2: 144. 43 A history of Aesthetic, 178, London, G.

"You seek beauty, and you do well. Be assured, then, that it springs from the rational part of you." 47 In other words, inward beauty represents moral perfection. In The Moralists we are told that the highest productions of human kind are those engen- dered in the heart or derived from the mind, our senti- ments, resolutions, principles, determinations, actions. Is it not logical to assume that it is these manifestations of human mind together with the parallel manifestations of the original mind which are meant when Shaftesbury speaks of the mind inspecting itself ? In the same para- graph Shaftesbury tells us that it is the wise and able man who passesi over considerations of material interest and "having righter models in his eye, becomes in trutl the architect of his own life and fortune by laying within himself the lasting and sure foundations of order, peace and concord." It is this moral integrity that Slhaftesbury hias in mind when he refers to "inner form" or "numbers of an in- ward kind." Where then is this beauty or harmony to be found? How is this symmetry to be discovered and applied? Is it any other art than that of philosophy, or the study of inward numbers and proportions, which can exhibit this in life? . . . Who can admire the outward beauties, and not recur instantly to the inward, which are the most real and essen- tial, the most niaturally affecting, and of the highest pleasure, as well as pronlt and( advantage? 4S There is absolutely no basis for interpreting Shaftes- bury's "inner form" as a mystical understanding of the secret of nature or of reconciling the one and the many, the inner and the outer, or this world and the other world.49 "Inner form" is another term for moral beauty or moral and intellectual adjustment to the universe. Its close relationship to stoic morality is seen in the "Philosophical Regimen." But if these outward things are fine with me, the otlhers will be lost that are truly fine, and that make me so, in the better sense. . . . Thus whilst I am in search of fineness, hunting beauty, and adding (as I imagine) great beauty 44Robertson, 1: 94-95. 45 Die Philosophie der Aufkliirung, 203. 46 Robertson, 2: 133. 4 Rand, Life, 246. 48 Robertson, 2: 270-271. 49 Cassirer, op. cit., 113. to myself in these ways, I really and in effect grow (le- formed and monstrous, sacrificing all internal proportions, all intrinsic, real beauty and worth for the sake of these things, which are neither the world's beauty, nior the pub- lic's, nor society's, nor my own in particular, nor anybodly's besides.50 Elsewhere in the Characteristics this moral (loctrine that beauty consists of complete conformity to nature in the stoic sense is demonstrated by analogy with literary and other artistic works. In Sensus Conniuniis Shaftesbury asserts that poets and men of harmony are necessarily influenced by the "moral magic" of senltiments, actions, character, and the "proportions and features of a human mind." The "love of numbers, decency and proportion" is the passion which inspires themi, and their principal and most influential theme is "purely manners, and the moral part." The beauty and effect of their art con- sists in representing moral truth (inward numbers) by means of harmonious symbols (outwardl numbers), in vocal measures of syllables, and sounds, to express the harmony and numbers of an inward kind; and represent the beauties of a human soul, by proper foils, and contr-a- rieties, which serve as graces in this limning, and render this music of the passions more powerful and enchanting.0 In Soliloquy, Shaftesbury states that the man who really deserves the name "poet," must first know him- self or "those numbers which make the harmony of a mind" before he can presume to depict men and man- ners or "give to an action its just body and proportion." Such a poet is indeed a second maker: a just Prometheus, under Jove. Like that Sovereign Artist or universal Plas- tick Nature, he forms a whole, coherent and proportional in itself, with due subjection and subordinacy of constituent parts. He notes the boundaries of the passions, and knows their exact tones and measures; by which he justly repre- sents them, marks the sublime of sentiments and actioln, and distinguishes the beautiful from the deformed, the amiable from the odious.52 This passage does not mean, as Cassirer interprets it, that the esthetic experience rests upon the individual's thinking of himself in regard to his original, indwellinlg forming power, not as one created, but as a creator. It does not mean that each man becomes a "second creator under Jove" by transcending the empirically real and perceiving the inner design which lies at the basis of each work of art. It does not mean that he in this way comes to comprehend the divine. Shaftesbury is talk- ing about the creative experience of the poet alone, not about the perceptive experience of all men. The poet is a creator in the sense that God is, forming a whole, duly coherent and proportioned. This "moral artist" understands the inward form and structure of his fel- low-creatures because he has a prior knowledge of him- self and knows how to guide himself by judgment and understanding. Here Shaftesbury is not even proposing 50 Rand, Life, 251. 51 Robertson, 1: 91. 5"Ibid. 1: 136.</page><page sequence="45">340 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. a cult of artistic genius, not even suggesting the con- ventional notion of inspiration by felicity. If Shaftes- bury is considered as! the founder of a new school of genius, he is so only in the sense that he advocates sub- jective as well as objective criteria of art, that he finds beauty in the artist, not in the art.53 Elsewhere in Soliloquy Shaftesbury asserts that in all kinds of writing relating to men and manners, it is necessary for the author to understand poetical and moral truth, the beauty of senti- ments, the sublime of characters; and carry in his eye the model or exemplar of that natural grace, which gives to every action its attractive charm. If he has naturally no eye, or ear, for these interior numbers; 'tis not likely he should be able to judge better of that exterior proportion and symmetry of composition, which constitutes a legiti- mate piece.54 Again these "interior numbers" have nothing to do with a revelation of the secrets of nature and the physi- cal world in each appearance of the beautiful. Shaftes- bury is merely comparing the numbers of poetry, "ex- terior proportion and symmetry of composition," with interior numbers or poetical and moral truth, the natu- ral and rational basis or standard of art and conduct. Such phrases as "interior numbers" and "second cre- ator under Jove" fit conveniently into a system of Plo- tinian mysticism if they are given the interpretation which the system requires. When they are shorn of their esoteric meanings, however, and regarded as parts of an extended analogy between moral and artistic in- tegrity, as Shaftesbury intended them, there is not much basis for a Plotinian interpretation. The principle of the hierarchy of beauty-that there exists in nature a scale of objects and minds ranging in order from the lowest to the highest-is the culmina- tion of Shaftesbury's esthetics and is grounded upon the principles previously described. Each of the prin- ciples is involved in the section of The Moralists in which Shaftesbury presents the scale of beauty and seeks to wean us by easy stages from a desire of the pleasures of sense to those of the spirit.55 Should we love the beauty of the ocean, we are told, it would be absurd to seek possession, like the Venetian doge, through a marriage ceremony. Should we be charmed by the beauty of trees, it would similarly be absurd to satiate ourselves with their fruit. And, finally, should we admire the graceful proportions of "living architec- ture," sensual indulgence would provide merely an inferior pleasure. We who are rational, and have minds, should not absurdly seek enjoyment from objects of sense, but in objects of the mind, in which is com- prehended all that is "truly, fair, generous, or good." Through this spiritual bond, beauty and good "are still one and the same." 53See: Louis I. Bredvold, The tendenicy toward Platonism ir Neo-Classical esthetics, E. L. H., Jour. English Lit. Hist. 1: 91-119, 1934. 54 Robertson, 1: 216. 55Ibid. 2: 124 ff. The methods by which we learn to relish this divine beauty are the same as those which we apply in the in- ferior arts. Basically, all love is enthusiasm, every- thing from the transports of poets to gallantry, war, and heroism. Yet the native enthusiasm must be refined and cultivated through the development of taste. As we do not instantly acquire the sense by which the beauties of the fine arts are discovered but need training for this perception, so there is a skill or science required for the understanding of the sovereign beauty. We must not assume that what we admire is beautiful or what we like is good; but must seek, beyond our fancies, for the absolute standard. The basic principle to observe is that in matter as such there is no beauty whatsoever, but beauty is imposed upon matter as form. "So that the beautifying, not the beautified, is the really beauti- ful." Beauty exists only in mind, "which means and intends for it, regulates and orders it." We discover this beauty as we ascend through three degrees or orders of beauty: first, "the dead forms . . . which bear a fashion and are formed, whether by man, or nature; but have no forming power, no action, or intelligence"; second, "the forms which form, that is, which have intelligence, action, and operation"; and, third, that "which forms not only such as we call mere forms, but even the forms which form." The first order includes all material objects in the universe; the second includes men and any other creatures with intelligence; and the last, "which fashions even minds themselves, contains in itself all the beauties fashioned by those minds; and is consequently the principle, source and fountain of all beauty," is the divine creator. There has never been any question about this order- ing being derived from Plato and Plotinus. The ques- tion concerns its interpretation. Shaftesbury is not presenting a system of mystical intuition, but is using Platonic symbolism to illustrate the predominantly stoic concept of the singleness in purpose and essential good of the whole universe. By placing God as the highest order, and showing that music, architecture, and every- thing of human invention is originally in or derived from this Supreme Beauty, Shaftesbury proves that perception of all beauty, particularly the final stage, de- pends in some measure on the Supreme Beauty. The Supreme Beauty, to Shaftesbury, does not represent a mystical creating force from which emanates a vague principle of love or good, but represents an intelligent providence which superintends the social structure of the universe so that universal order may be maintained. In an earlier section of The Moralists the scale of beauty is presented primarily from this social point of view.50 The one who is "well-knowing and experienced' in all the degrees and orders of beauty, in all the mysterious charms of the particular forms," rises to what is more general and seeks the highest of the kind. "Not cap- tivated by the lineaments of a fair face, or the well- drawn nronortions of a human body." he views life 58 Ibid. 2: 20 ff.</page><page sequence="46">VOL. 41. PT. 2, 19511 VIRTUOSOSHIP 341 itself and embraces the mind. From single minds he rises to communities, friendships, and other social rela- tionships, and, still seeking richer satisfaction, pro- gresses to the good of mankind. Finally, in quest of order and perfection, he "seeks the good of all, and affects the interest and prosperity of the whole." And since all hope of this were vain and idle if no uni- versal mind presided; . . . 'tis here the generous mind labours to discover that healing cause by which the interest of the whole is securely established, the beauty of things and the universal order happily sustained. In Miscellaneous Reflections Shaftesbury analyzes this social ideal in detail, showing the manner in which the various elements of the universe are knit together in one harmonious whole. Here the scale of beauty has three divisions, things inanimate, animate, and mixed. In the inanimate the scale runs from regular figures and symmetries with which children are delighted to archi- tecture and the arts, from stones and rocks to moun- tains, vales and "nature herself considered as inanimate and passive"; in the animate, from animals to men, from single individuals to organized groups of living crea- tures, "the union and harmony of Nature herself, con- sidered as animate and intelligent"; and in the mixed, from the union of body and mind of a single person to friendship and love joined with a household, city or nation to form "that agreeable idea of home, family, country." This same scale appears in the "Philosophi- cal Regimen" followed by a quotation from Marcus Aurelius stating that the things admired by the multi- tude are "held together by cohesion or natural cohe- sion," a quotation emphasizing the social aspect of this stoic conception.57 The ascent of the scale of beauty would mean for Shaftesbury, not a mystical sense of identification with the divine or a mystical intuition of the secret of nature and the universe, but instead the attainment of the stoic ideal of freedom from the passions and low interests to- gether with reconcilement to the order of the universe, harmony with nature and friendship with both God and man.58 It is not suggested that the Platonic and stoic philosophies are antithetical. Indeed Shaftesbury re- gards the one as an outgrowth of the other. Yet in the Characteristics is found the stoic teaching of individual adjustment to the universe as a harmonious whole com- posed of cooperating subordinate elements, rather than the neo-Platonic idea of the One as a mystic entity with which the individual seeks to incorporate himself in an effort to blot out all distinction between the one and the many. In morals, the stoic emphasis on the whole of the uni- verse as a regular, balanced, and ordered economy leads to the conception of a rigorous code of conduct based on an immutable natural standard of right and wrong. The opposite view, which emphasizes the elements of chance and uncertainty in the universe, leads to a flex- 57Rand, Life, 244. 58 Robertson, 2: 133- ible code of conduct based on the view that right and wrong are mutable and relative. In esthetics a similar relationship exists. The emphasis on order and regu- larity is associated with stability, permanence, and con- formity to universal standards, and the emphasis on independence, variety, and experimentation is associated with variation, change, and individual proclivity as the sole criterion of excellence. Shaftesbury in both ethi- cal and esthetic relations, consistently emphasizes the whole, even in a passage written in the "romantic way," which is sometimes quoted as exhibiting a contrary trend. One of Shaftesbury's characters in The Moral- ists vindicates a taste for the wild, the primitive and the irregular in landscape and natural surroundings as he praises the charm of "even the rude rocks, the mossy caverns, the irregular unwrought grottos, and broken falls of waters, with all the horrid graces of the wilder- ness itself." 59 This does not in the least invalidate Shaftesbury's continued emphasis on order and regu- larity, for these primitive beauties are clearly presented as those of an inferior kind, and they are praised entirely on the grounlds that true order is found amid the crude and rugged conditions of nature "where neither art, nor the conceit or caprice of man has spoiled their genuine order, by breaking in upon that primitive state." Al- though Shaftesbury is condemning the "formal mockery of princely gardens," he vindicates a rapturous enthu- siasm for natural scenery, not because of the surface or representative beauty of the woods, rivers or seashores, but because through representative beauty we obtain closest access to the first beauty, which is equivalent to the order of the universe. He is seeking to transport us by means of the pleasures of the sense to those of the mind. In morals, similarly, particular affections are of value only as they transport us to natural affection or love for the whole. In An Inquiry we are told that partial affection, or social love in part, without regard to a complete society or whole, is in itself an inconsistency, and implies an absolute contradiction. . Whatever affec- tion we have towards anything besides ourselves, if it be not of the natural sort towards the system or kind, it must be of all other affections the most dissociable, and destruc- tive of the enjoyments of society.A0 The identical relationship in which morality and es- thetics stand in regard to order and the whole is seen in The Moralists.11 The whole is a system established upon order and held together by a social cohesive force. Morals and the arts are founded upon a perception or sense of this order and proportion as it is reflected in all of its subsidiary elements. Whatever things have order, the same have unity of design, and concur in one, are parts constituent of one whole, or are, in themselves, entire systems. Such is a tree, with all its branches: an animal. with all its members; an edifice, 59Ibid. 2: 125. 60 Ibid. 1: 299-300. 61 Ibid. 2: 63 ff.</page><page sequence="47">342 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM T,rRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. with all its exterior and interior ornamenits. Wlhat else is even a tune or symphony, or any excellent piece of music, than a certain system of proportioned sounds? In the universe, all individual parts are united even- tually into a harmonious whole, "a system complete, according to one simple, consistent, and uniform de- sign." Even man himself, whatever his individual or internal perfection, cannot be considered complete un- less he exists in perfect accord and harmony with the system of his kind. The essence of the Characteristics lies in the doctrine of this kinship between the artist and the moralist, both creating an individual systemii of order and integrity as part of the order an-d whole of the universe. It is epitomized in the description of the poet as "a second maker: a just Prometheus, under Jove," and as a "moral artist" who understands the inwaard numbers of the mind or moral integrity. In both nmoral and artistic realms, "he forms a whole, colherent and proportioned in itself, with due subjection and sub- ordinacy of constituent parts." 62 With this moral and esthetic theory, it was inevitable that Shaftesbury should be a classicist in literary and artistic theory and uphold standards of unity and order. In the final section of Sensus Commuinn is, he applies the principle of universal order to painting. A painter, he asserts, must not be a realist in the sense of duplicating objectively on canvas the exact physical details which he sees before him, for to do so would be to present only a part of nature, the limits of his art obviously making it impossible to present the whole. "However, his piece, if it be beautiful, and carries truth, must be a whole, by itself, complete, independent, and withal as great and comprehensive as he can make it." To attain this artistic integrity, he must obviously depart from objective reality. He realizes that "he is even then un- natural, when he follows nature too close, and strictly copies life." In this section Shaftesbury represents the antithesis of romanticism. The particulars of a scene, he continues, must be sacrificed to the general design, "in order to form a certain easiness of sight; a simple, clear, and united view, which would be broken and dis- turbed by the expression of any thing peculiar, or dis- tinct." In support of this opinion, Shaftesbury presents in the notes a long quotation from Aristotle's Poetics, and asserts that the greatest artists were careful to ob- serve the principles of the "whole itself" and "one united view" and that when they erred, "it was on the side of greatness, by running into the unsizable and gigantic, rather than into the minute and delicate." In the text, Shaftesbury continues with a philosophical defense of portraying the general as opposed to the particular in art. He admits that variety is the dominant principle in nature, that everything has a peculiar, original char- acter "which, if strictly observed, will make the subject unlike to anything extant in the world." The good poet and painter carefully avoid following nature in this sense. however, for they hate minuteness and fear sin- 62 Ilid. 1: 136. ,ularity. The "face-painter" belonigs to an inferior )rder, having little in common with the poet, but is like he historian, copyinig exactly what he sees. Shaftes- ury contrasts these inferior painters with men of genius nd invention, who design their work fromi the many ob- Iects of nature, not from a particular one. The best mrtists have regarded the best statues as better models whan the most perfect humanl bodies, and the best crit- cs, including Aristotle, have preferred poetry to history is "better teaching the truth of characters, and nature Af mankind." The French translator in a note to this passage supports Shaftesbury's disparagement of por- traiture with the authority of Poussin, asserting that Poussin had contempt for those who were able only to copy nature as they saw it and that lhe insisted that subjects be original and the execution unique.63 A similar treatment of the themie of order and unity from a purely literary point of view is presented; in detail in Miscellanieous Reflectionls.64 The stoic element in Shaftesbury's mioral philosophy cannot very well be reconciled with his theodicy, the vindication of providence on the assumption of the benevolence of the entire universe, for if the moral order of the universe is entirely benevolent, there is nlo nleed of stoic austerity. Shaftesbury's earliest critic, Robert Day, exposed this weakness of An Inquiry. The inconsistency is by no meanis peculiar to Shaftes- bury, however, for the vindication of providence takes up much room also in the writings of the stoics. In The Moralists, Shaftesbury's vindication of providence is based, not on the ground that destiny provides the temporal good of every man, but that every mani through stoic moral virtue may place himself on a level above temporal good. The universe is vindicatedl because it is possible for every man to transcend temiporal needs, reasoning closely linked with the conclusion of Ai In- quiry, that virtue is the good and vice, the ill of every man. The contrary principle of The Moralists that evil is necessary in the world is only apparently contradic- tory, for without evil there can he no trial of virtue and, consequently, no virtue. Despite the fact that Shaftesbury's mloral and esthetic theories are intended primarily to vindicate the moral order of the universe, some nmodern critics have paidl more attention to corollary concepts and ancillary pas- sages than to his fun(ldamental aims. They hlave ideniti- fied with primitivism Shaftesbury's rlhapsodic praise of wild and irregular beauty in The Moralists because in the eighteenth century a taste for the wild and irregu- lar in landscapes was frequently accompanied by a preference for rural over urban societies and primitive over contemnporary civilization. We can best under- stand Shaftesbury by initerpreting his ideas as Shaftes- bury himself understood them rather than by fitting them into any patterns of thought of the age whlich are evident only in a retrospective view. Shaftesbury prob- 63 Essai sur l'usage de la raillerie, 164-165, la Haye, 1710. 64 Robertson, 2: 317 ff.</page><page sequence="48">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 1951] VIRTUOSOSHIP 343 ably would not have understood the label "primitivism," and even if he had, he would probably have asserted that it had no real bearing on his works. As defined by Arthur 0. Lovejoy, "primitivism is, of course, the belief that the earliest condition of man and of human society, l'homrne tel qu'il a di' sortir des mains de la Nature, was the best condition." 65 Al- though primitivism is almost opposite in character to virtuosoship, there is no question that Shaftesbury holds ideas prominent in primitivism, in fact fundamental to it. Among these are the views that a natural light or reason is available to all men, that mankind is essentially benevolent, and that man's benevolence is based upon feelings and expressed by them. If it can be proved that the motivations of man's inner or natural senses are more wholesome and salutary than those formed by education, the position of the primitivist is greatly sup- ported. Shaftesbury actually asserts that men's first thoughts of honesty "are generally better than their second: their natural notions better than those refined by study or consultation with casuists." 6' "For even rude Nature itself, in its primitive simplicity, is a bet- ter guide to judgment than improved sophistry and pedantic learning." 67 But there is much more than a doctrine of virtuous natural feelings required for a theory of primitivism. Primitivism is a form of sociological theory, and, even though anti-social in some of its manifestations, must refer to the social organism. Primitivism has two phases: (1) the view that man was better a long time ago than he is now (chronological primitivism); (2) the view that man is better as a savage than living in a civilized state (cultural primitivism). Primitivism assumes that when all aspects are fully considered, the earlier organism is to be preferred to the modern, or the uncivilized state to the civilized. In the above pas- sages from Shaftesbury there is no social teaching what- soever. Men's first thoughts may be better than their second, or rude instincts may be preferred to a laby- rinth of pedantry and sophistry just as well in New York City as in the Virgin Islands. Even if it be granted that Shaftesbury is speaking of man in a soli- tary state, he is not stating that when all aspects of civilized and uncivilized societies are considered, the latter is to be preferred to the former. He is merely rebuking pedantry, and praising in contrast natural simplicity of character, not primitive society or the lack of society. He is saying that no learning is better than false learning, not that nature is better than culture. The case for Shaftesbury's primitivism is presented in most forceful and detailed form by Lois Whitney in her book, Primitivisnim and the Idea of Progress, and in an earlier article, "Thomas Blackwell, A Disciple of Shaftesbury," Miss Whitney deals with theories of 6t Foreword to Lois Whitney, Primitivism and the idea of progress, xi, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press, 1934. 66 Robertson, 1: 88. 67Ibid. 1: 215. primitivism in order to trace a parallel contradiction in Shaftesbury and Blackwell.68 In neither her book nor her article, however, does Mliss Whitney directly label Shaftesbury's thought primitivism, but considers his theories as bolstering primitivism and containing primi- tivistic presuppositions and inferences. In her article she begins with summarizing Shaftes- bury's refutation of Hobbes's view that the state of nature is a state of war, citing his statements that "there is naturally in every man such a degree of social affec- tion as inclines him to seek the familiarity and friend- ship of his fellows"; 69 that "If eating and drinking be natural, herding is so too. If any appetite or sense be natural, the sense of fellowship is the same": 70 that "In short, if generation be natural, if natural affection and the care and nurture of the offspring be natural, things standing as they do with man, and the creature being of that form and constitution he now is, it fol- lows 'that Society must be also natural to him,' and 'that out of society and community he never did, nor ever can, subsist' ": 71 and that the state of nature was "not that imperfect rude condition of mankind . . . which some imagine; but which if it ever were in na- ture, could never have been of the least continuance, or any way tolerable, or sufficient for the support of human race. Such a condition cannot indeed so prop- erly be called a state." 72 In this connection Shaftesbury also says that if man ever existed in a pre-social state, it must have been but "the rough draught of man, the essay or first effort of Nature . . . not in its natural state, but under violence, and still restless, till it at- tained its natural perfection," 7 and Shaftesbury asks "Could she Nature then rest, think you, in that deso- late state before society?" 4 "Faith, justice, honesty, and virtue, must have been as early as the state of na- ture, or they could never have been at all." '5 Further, man "is not only by Nature sociable within the limits of his own species or kind but in; a yet more generous or extensive manner. He is not only born to virtue, friendship, honesty, and faith; but to religion, piety, adoration, and a generous surrender of his min(d to whatever happens from that Supreme Cause or order of things, which -he acknowledges entirely just and perfect." 76 In the above quotations Shaftesbury says that man's natural state is a virtuous one, but, it is important to notice, he does not say that man loses his virtue when he becomes civilized. To maintain that a sense of fel- lowship or social affection is natural is no more an argument in favor of a pre-civilized state than is to 68'Philol.

SOC. maintain walking, the exercise of vocal chords, or the desire to procreate, to be natural. It is true that Shaftesbury's theory of the origin of society is more favorable to primitivism than is that of Hobbes, but Shaftesbury still does not maintain that the earlier or least developed forms of society are the best.77 If we turn next to Miss Whitney's book, we shall find in addition to passages illustrating Shaftesbury's theories of benevolence and natural virtue, two par- ticular passages cited which seem to lead to "certain other primitivistic presuppositions and inferences." 78 In the first Shaftesbury speaks of that simplicity of manners and innocence of behavior which has been often known among mere savages ere they were corrupted by our commerce, and, by sad example, instructed in all kinds of treachery and inhumanity. 'Twould be of advantage to us to hear the causes of this strange corrup- tion in ourselves, and be made to consider of our deviation from nature.79 Although on the surface this passage seems to praise the noble savage at the expense of the wicked product of civilization, when it is seen in its context it is seen to have a quite different meaning. Actually Shaftes- bury is condemning a particular section of John Locke's Essay concerning Human Understanding in which Locke credulously repeats the tales of travelers con- cerning the monstrous religious customs and beliefs among savage tribes. Locke in attempting to destroy the doctrine of innate ideas was prone to believe ac- coiints of diversitv in relivinils observances. and 77 The other passages from Shaftesbury in Miss Whitney's article are of opposite tendency, being designed to illustrate a contradiction in Shaftesbury's thought. This contradiction con- sists in the statement that a moral sense is natural to man, that "faith, justice, honesty, and virtue, must have been as early as the state of nature," together with the conflicting statement that a sense of beauty, moral and physical, depends upon rea- son, practice and culture. The point of the article is that this contradiction is parallel to one in Blackwell, who states that the Greeks of Homer's time were "unaffected and natural," "noble and virtuous," but contradicts himself by asserting a theory of a cycle of social development in which manners become more virtuous as dangers and hardships produce bravery and temper- ance in a wealthy and prosperous society together with a theory that "natural" goodness must be instilled in man by the "arts of life." Miss Whitney's argument is in brief: Shaftesbury is in- consistent; Blackwell's works exhibit a similar, generally rele- vant, inconsistency; therefore Blackwell is a disciple of Shaftes- bury. At best this reasoning is not very convincing, and it is made less so by Miss Whitney's Primitivism and the idea of progress in which she shows that Blackwell's same general in- consistency existed in scores of eighteenth-century writers, many of whom exhibit no direct connections of any kind with Shaftes- bury. There is no reason to single out Blackwell for compari- son except for the comments of a few biographers on Blackwell's admiration of Shaftesbury, but these comments, in Miss Whit- ney's own words, "refer more specifically to his style than to his philosophical point of view." There is about as much rea- son for labeling Blackwell a disciple of Shaftesbury as there is for labeling Shaftesbury a primitivist. For a consideration of Shaftesbury's contradiction mentioned above see page 335 ff. of this chapter. 78 Op. cit., 35. 79 Robertson, 1: 226-227. Shaftesbury as a proponent of doctrines of innate moral sense and natural reason, doctrines which assume a certain amount of uniformity, impugns the veracity of the tales of deviation from nature and scoffs at Locke's credulity.A0 Shaftesbury in the passage quoted is merely asserting that even among savage tribes, sim- plicity and innocence are more prevalent than moral and religious atrocities. It is Locke who brought in the savages as evidence, not Shaftesbury. By alluding to deviations from nature, Shaftesbury means merely that similarities between savage tribes rather than differ- ences should be stressed. His theory of moral sense is ethical and epistemological and has nothing intrinsically to do with primitivism even though it may be used to support primitivism. If we examine Shaftesbury's note to the sentence pre- ceding the passage just quoted, we shall perceive that Shaftesbury's main interest in this section of his treatise is to condemn superficial scholarship and learning and to appeal for a renewed emphasis upon practical virtue in literature and philosophy. To this end' he quotes ex- tracts from Isaac Casaubon's Preface to his commentary on Persius on the "subject of philosophy, learning, and the sister arts, after that ancient model which has since been so much corrupted." These extracts are dedicated to the praise of learning and a statement of its purpose, and they express many of Shaftesbury's favorite themes, particularly the subject of the union of poetry and phi- losophy. Casaubon asserts the view that the purpose of learning is not to make a vain display or to please the ear with empty sounds, but to develop right conduct and high ideals by exerting an influence upon contem- porary life, and he condemns the pedantic approach to scholarship and the substitution of sophistical terms and "hard words" in theology in place of true understand- ing and sound learning, ideas echoed throughout the Characteristics. The historical view of learning given in these extracts is part of Shaftesbury's intellectual equipment also and goes contrary to primitivism. Ca- saubon describes the course of literature as a flourish- ing during the classical age, followed by a dying out, and a recent restoration to light. The invasions of the Goths brought on the corruption in theology and other sciences, he says, but the underlying cause was the wrong training in liberal disciplines and the ignorance of languages. Support of Casaubon's views is found in the other sections of the Characteristics which Shaftes- bury himself refers to immediately following the Latin quotations. All of the passages here cited are directed against pedantry, but one in particular contains a doc- trine anti-primitivist in tendency. In it Shaftesbury so See Essay concerning hunian understanding, Bk. I, Chap. III, Sec. 9; Chap. IV, Sec. 8. A parallel passage is Wollaston's comment: "I cannot without a degree of indignation find a sort of writers pleasing themselves with having discovered some un- civilized nations, which have little or no knowledge of the Deity, &amp;c. and then applying tneir observations to the service of athe- ism. As if ignorance could prove any thing, or alter its nature by being general !"

For as the highest improvements of temper are made in human kind, so the greatest corruptions and degeneracies are discoverable in this race. . . . Even those creatures of prey who live the farthest out of society, maintain, we see, such a conduct towards one another as is exactly suitable to the good of their own species. Whilst man, notwith- standing the assistance of religion and the direction of laws, is often found to live in less conformity with Nature, and by means of religion itself is often rendered the more barbarous and inhuman. . . . No wonder if in such soci- eties 'tis so hard to find a man who lives naturally and as a man.82 When this passage is closely examined, it will be seen that it is actually not an expression of primitivism but merely the principle that the worst and the best are to be found among human beings. Shaftesbury is saying that a greater variation in nature appears in man than in any other creature. Individuals of other species do not vary a great deal from each other, but great varia- tions in moral character are to be found among man- kind. Shaftesbury had previously stated that man by nature needs the strongest force of social affections. Man lives "in less conformity with Nature" when he acts contrary to his inherent affections. To point this out is not a denunciation of progress nor is it a yearn- ing for the old or primitive. In fairness to Miss Whitney it is necessary to state again that she does not specifically label Shaftesbury a primitivist and actually states that "the general implica- tions of his theory of proportion and harmony in the moral life have a quite opposite tendency." 83 The fre- quent linking of Shaftesbury with primitivist theories, however, makes it necessary to point out specifically that there is in the Characteristics absolutely no state- ment of primitivism, either chronological or cultural, even though some of Shaftesbury's doctrines may give support to primitivism. A classicist as well as a deist, Shaftesbury was known in the eighteenth century as a restorer of ancient philosophy, and ancient philosophy is not primitive innocence.84 81 Robertson, 1: 124-125. 82Ibid. 1: 292. 83 op. Cit., 91. 84 In her book Miss Whitney discusses three contradictions in Shaftesbury, which perhaps need to be considered here. The first is that the operation of moral sense is presented as being controlled both by reason, the reflective principle, and by feeling or affection, considered as prior to reason and stronger. Op. cit., 33. The second is that Shaftesbury regards alternately as guides of conduct, moral sense, presented as natural to all men, and taste, considered as based upon study and practice. Ibid., 35-36. The third, derived from W. R. Scott's Francis Hutche- son, his life, teaching, and position in the history of philosophy (Cambridge, 1900), is that he forgets his central principle that the social affections make man's chief end the good of society by making the artistic life an end in itself.

Although Shaftesbury rejected the primitivistic sup- positions of many deists as valid sociological theory, his political views were conditioned in part by the cosmo- politanism of nearly all deists. According to Professor Lovejoy, the deists assumed that since gifts of nature are equally distributed, no one race or nation has special privileges of access to God. It is a logical step from this position to the view that no sect or dynasty of men may have privileged access to God or special right to rule over their fellows. This reasoning led to two important political principles in the Characteristics, denial of the doctrine of apostolic succession in the church, and denial of the divine right of governors in the state. Deism, of course, cannot be considered as primarily a politi- cal movement, for both Tories, like Bolingbroke, and Whigs, like Shaftesbury, could be ardent deists. Yet Shaftesbury's deistical presuppositions undoubtedly con- tributed to his opposition to the Tory doctrines of in- herited authority. The true nature of Shaftesbury's political views has been obscured by critics who have charged that Shaftes- bury followed Hobbes in assigning to the magistrate the power of determining what the national form of worship should be.1 Among authors of some note, Lamennais compares Hobbes and Shaftesbury as agreeing that re- ligion is a purely political matter, to be regarded not on the authority of God, but on the authority of the king.2 This association of Hobbes and Shaftesbury is probably derived from John Leland's A View of the Principal Deistical Writers, first published in 1754, in which it is asserted that Shaftesbury exactly agrees with Hobbes in "making the magistrate or supreme civil power the sole judge of religious truth and orthodoxy, and resolv- ing all doctrines and opinions in religion, and the au- thority of what shall be accounted holy writ, into the appointment of the state." Since Shaftesbury was an unequivocal foe of Hobbes's entire political and social theory, denouncing especially his policy of authoritarian control of literature and opin- ion. it is surDrising to see Shaftesburv and Hobbes com- dealt with the first contradiction on pages 334-335 of this chapter and with the second on page 335. The third, it seems to me, is no contradiction at all. Both social good and artistic integrity may be legitimate ends of life, and they are not mutually ex- clusive. 1 John Stoughton, Religion in England under Queen Anne and the Georges 1: 133, London, 1878.

True, the question of the religious establishment and civil authority is important in the Characteristics; it is repeatedly introduced and treated formally and by innuendo. Yet Shaftesbury's treatment of the question has practically no bearing on Hobbes, but Nwas provoked by a series of important events in English church history between 1700 and 1711. Shaftesbury's treatment itself may even have contributed to an important political up- heaval of the period. This large and important section of Shaftesbury's works can be fully understood only in the light of these historical episodes, which appeared extremely stirring and significant to Shaftesbury and his contemporaries, but which are now practically for- gotten. They reveal that most of Shaftesbury's darts against religious organization are directed specifically against the extreme High Church group and its attempt to establish its authority as independent of the civil state and to assert its almost exclusive right to serve in the priestly capacity. Shaftesbury's contrary position that the church derives its authority from the state and that it has no exclusive commission from heaven is a posi- tion shared by many clergymen in the Church of Eng- land and is derived from a political philosophy quite contrary to that of Hobbes. To show this will require a brief survey of the somewhat complicated ecclesiasti- cal history of the period. During the tremendously exciting period between 1700 and 1711, the terms High Church and Low Church came into being to explain the dissensions between con- flicting groups within the Church of England. In gen- eral, the Low Church group was made up of moderates and latitudinarians who advocated a policy of toleration toward other religious groups and whose political sym- pathies were Whig; the High Church group was made up of the high-flyers, Jacobites, and nonjurors who were intransigent in their opposition to other religious groups, particularly the dissenters, and whose political syvmpathies were Tory. The animosities between the two groups were continually flaring up over such issues as the rights of the Lower House of the Convocation, the practice of occasional conformity, the civil and sacer- dotal powers of the establishment, the principle of pas- sive obedience, and the state of the nation in regard to infidelity. Shaftesbury did not declare himself spe- cifically on all of these issues, but all contribute to the background of the Sacheverell affair and the high-flying affirmations of apostolic succession, issues on which Shaftesbury took a firm stand. On these issues, Shaftesbury's attitude conforms in general with that of the moderate church group under the leadership of Bishops Burnet and Hoadly. Shaftesbury's final word on tlhe subject of religion is found in the last section of Miscellaneous Reflections, its length and strategic position revealing the great impor- tance which Shaftesbury attached to the issue of the political foundation of religion. He describes a gentle- man of some rank engaged in a discussion of religious questions wvith a group of violent and bigoted adver- saries. These zealots having provoked him to an open vindication of free-thinking and free-discoursing in mat- ters of religion, the gentleman defends himself with lengthy quotations from respected divines and then as- serts his indifference to the names of "heteroclox, schis- matic, heretic, sceptic, . . . even infidel, or atlheist it- self" when levelled against him by his clerical associates. The temperate gentleman represents Shaftesbury him- self, and the dealers in invective represent High Church- men who had attacked him. The continuation of the mild gentleman's remarks represents Shaftesbury's apto- logia for his Cliaracteristics against the aspersions of the clergy, to whom he gives the following advice. "that since they have of late been so elated by some seeming advantages and a prosperity whlich they are ill fitted to bear, they would at least beware of accumulating too hastily those high characters, appellations, titles, and ensigns of power, which may be tokens, perhaps, of what they expect here- after, but whiclh, as yet, do not answer the real power and authority bestowed on them." The garb and countenance will be more graceful when the thing itself is secured to them and in their actual possession. Meanwhile, the antici- pation of high titles, honours, and nominal dignities beyond the common style and ancient usage, though it may be highly fashionable at present, may not prove beneficial or advantageous in the end. I would, in particular, advise my elegant antagonists of this zealot-kind, that among the many titles they assume to themselves they would be rather more sparing in that high one of ambassador, till such time as they have just means and foundation to join that of plenipotentiary together with it. For as matters stand hitherto in our British world, neither their commission from the sovereign nor that which they pretend from heaven, amounts to any absoltite or deter- nmining power.4 The early apostles, the gentleman continues, had the power of performing miracles to substantiate their title of ambassador, but it would be more becoming for the present clergy to use "a modester title to express their voluntary negotiation between us and heaven." Certain I am that if there be any such residentship or agent- ship now established, 'tis not immediately from God himself, but through the magistrate and by the prince or sovereign power here on earth, that these gentlemen agents are ap- pointed, distinguished, and set over us. . . . Allowing it ever so certain a truth, "that there has been a thousand or near two thousand years' succession in this commission of embassy," where shall we find this commission to have lain? How has it been supplied still, or renewed? How often dormant? How often divided, even in one and the same species of claimants? What party are they among mod- erns who by virtue of any immediate testimonial from heaven are thus entitled ? Where are the letters patent ? the credentials ? It is vitally necessary to decide, the gentleman contin- ues, "wlhether their excellencies of the present establish- ment are the sole-commissioned" or whether there are as many commissioned as there are pretenders. 'Tis to be feared, in good earnest, that the discernment of this kind will prove pretty difficult, especially amidst this 4 Robertson, 2: 364-365.</page><page sequence="52">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 19511 THE MAGISTRATE 347 universal contention, embroil, and fury of religious chal- lengers, these high defiances of contrary believers, this zealous opposition of commission to commission, and this din of hell, anathemas, and damnations raised everywhere by one religious party against another. After quoting two stanzas from Gonidibert concerning the priesthood, the secular gentleman concludes his dis- course: The poet, it seems, never dreamt of a time when the very countenance of moderation should be out of fashion with the gentlemen of this order, and the word itself exploded as unworthy of their profession. And, indeed, so far are they at present from bearing with any sceptic or inquirer, ever so modest or discreet, that to hear an argument on a contrary side to theirs, or read whatever may be writ in answer to their particular assertions, is made the highest crime. Whilst they have among themselves such differ- ences and sharp debates about their heavenly commission, and are even in one and the same community or establish- ment divided into different sects and headships, they will allow no particular survev or inspection into the founda- tions of their controverted title. 'When considered by themselves, these remarks seem to be directed against Christianity in general, but when considered in relation to the ecclesiastical history of the reign of Queen Anne, they are seen to have reference particularly to the extreme attitudes taken by the high- flying church party. The ecclesiastical dissensions with which we are con- cerned began in the last years of the seventeenth century over the repeated prorogation of the Convocation of the Church of England. Francis Atterbury rose into prom- inence as ecclesiastical champion of the Tories and standard-bearer of the High Church group by his con- tinual asseverations of the rights of the convocation. As a sign of the times, it is important to notice that the bishops who constituted the upper house of the convoca- tion were in general sympathetic to Low Church princi- ples, and that the lower house contained the zealous high-flyers.5 As the controversy over church powers continued, the lower house vociferously asserted ex- treme sacerdotal rights of the church, and the upper house was placed in the anomalous position of "lower- ing" church authority. Mattlhew Tindal, writing in 1706, praised the Christian spirit of the then present Archbishop "and most of the Bishops, who instead of joining with the Laudean Faction in Ecclesiastical In- croachment, dare provoke the Malice of a Rampant High-Church Party by signalizing themselves in the defence of Liberty." 6 The spokesman of the moderates who came to the fore as Atterbury's adversary was Benjamin Hoadly. On September 29, 1705, Hoadly preached a sermon arguing that Paul in Romans XIII lhad taiight merely that the people should obey rulers 5 Gilbert Burnet, History of mty own time 2: 347, London, 1724-1734.

Y., 1891. 6 The rights of the Christian Chuirch asserted, 257-258, Lon- don, 1706. who governed for the good of their people.7 The lower house of the convocation at the instigation of Atterbury drew up a letter to the bishops asking that synodical notice be taken of the dishonor done to the church by this position which was contrary to the church's stand "against disobedience or wilful rebellion." 8 Hoadly's position as reaffirmed and epitomized some years after is that "it is Lawful, and Gloriouts for . . . Subjects to consult the Happiness of the Public, anid of their Poster- ity after them, by opposinig anid resistig . . . Gover- nours" who act contrary to the end of their institution and invade the rights of their subjects.9 The opposite principle of the divine riglht of the magistrate, extending even to control of religion, was asserted by Offspring Blackall, Bishop of Exeter. In order to demonstrate that it is to the good of the people to be pleased, with their lot of subjection and to yield due obedience and submission to their rulers, he affirmed that "God has given the Civil Magistrate Commission and Authority to govern well all the People commiitted to his Charge, to enact and execute all needful Laws; . . . and to him also appertains to provide for the Establishment of the true Religion; . . . And from subjection to this Au- thority of the Civil Magistrate, or Supreme Legislative Power, no Order of Men whatsoever is exempt." 10 This is essentially the position of Hobbes, and, as we shall see, directly opposite to that of Shaftesbury. Al- though the High Church clergymeen inveighed against Hobbes for denying the independent authority of the clhurch, they uniformly fell back on his arguments to support the doctrines of passive obedience and non- resistance. Hoadly, in replying to Blackall, reaffirmed the Whig principle that if the magistrate abuses his authority, the people may defend themselves against him.1" He also affirmed the principle of religious toleration, declaring that the end of government is the happiness of the gov- erned society, which consists in the "Enjoyment of Lib- erty, Property, and the free Exercise of Religion" and that "as there is no Tyranny so odious to God as Tyr- anny over the Conscience; so is there no Slavery so uneasy and ignominious, as a forc'd Religion, or a Wor- ship imposed upon wveak Men by the Fear, or Applica- tion of outward Inconveniences." 12 Atterbury and the High Church party, on the other side, contended for the power of the lower house of convocation, the divine authority of the magistrate, and the exclusive right of clergymen whose succession could be traced to the apostles to administer the sacrament. The latter principle was carried to extremes by the non- 7 The mneasures of submission to the Civil Magistrate consid- cr'd, 3d ed., London, 1710. 8 Thomas Lathbury, A history of the Convocation, 401, Lon- don, 1853. 9 Op. cit., 39-40. 10 The divine institutiont of Magistracy, 15, London, 1708. 11 Some considerations hum-bly offered to the . . .

The favorite method of the high-flyers to attract attention to their cause was to envisage plots and threats against the Establishment from deists, papists, quakers, unitarians, dissenters, and every possible opposition group. "The Church in danger" became a rallying cry which served admirably to strengthen the hand of the Tories. As a countermeasure the Whigs prevailed upon Queen Anne to deliver a speech in which she repudiated the malicious insinuations concerning the Church's peril and declared her policy to be maintaining both the Es- tablishment and the principle of toleration.13 In the House of Lords, however, Compton, the Bishop of Lon- don, denounced the Whig doctrines of Hoadly's sermon before the Lord Mayor, a sermon in which Compton asserted "rebellion was countenanced, and resistance to the higher powers encouraged." 14 Hoadly was then de- fended in debate by Bishop Burnet. After further debate on the situation it was voted by the House of Lords that the Church was "not in dan- ger," an affirmation which the Commons supported. Four years later a High Church zealot, Henry Sachev- erell, preached two incendiary sermons in which he asserted, directly contrary to the declaration of Parlia- ment, that the Church was in real and imminent danger. In these sermons, subsequently printed as The Com- munication of Sin; being a Sermon preached at the As- sizes held at Derby, August 15, 1709, and The Perils of False Brethren both in Church and State; Set forth in a Sermon preach'd before the Right Honourable the Lord-Mayor, Alderman, and Citizens of London, at the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, on the 5th of November, 1709, Sacheverell denounced the Revolution as an un- lawful act, asserted the doctrine of absolute non-resist- ance, attacked the principle of toleration, classed the ministers among the false brethren, and cast aspersions on Burnet and Hoadly. The Whig reaction to Saclheverell, which Shaftesbury undoubtedly shared and reflected in the passages quoted above, is expressed in the following summary by John Toland of political-religious conditions in 1710. We in England are divided into Whigs and Tories. The First are Zealous Sticklers for Civil Liberty, and sworn Enemies to Ecclesiastical Tyranny, The latter do not will- ingly admit of any Toleration in Matters of Religion; or of any Check upon the Will of the Sovereign. . . .

Primitive Worship and Discipline Prophan'd, and Abus'd; Her Sacred Orders Denyed and Villified; Her Priests and Professors (like St. Paul) Calumniated, Misrepresented, and Ridiculed; Her Altars and Sacraments prostituted to Hypocrites, Deists, Socinians, and Atheists. He places in express terms LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE . . . among the Treacherous and Detestable Doctrines which are Preached by False Brethren, and would not make a Recon- ciliation with the Dissenters, at the expence of One single Ceremony, or by the alteration of the Minutest Word in the Liturgy. . You ought not . . . to think it strange, that he falls foul as furiously against GENEVA as against ROME, which he looks upon as two extreams equally vicious, of which his diminutive Faction, is both the Lauda- ble Middle, and the only Holy Orthodox and Apostolic Church.15 Three years before Sacheverell's sermon, a notorious book had appeared which presented essentially the same theories of church and state as those held by the Low Church. Ostensibly printed as a defense of episcopal power, the work, by Matthew Tindal, The Rights of the Christian Church Asserted (1706), was actually an at- tack on the principles of the high-flyers and non-jurors. It assumed great importance in the struggle concerning ecclesiastical authority and gave Shaftesbury some ideas which were later incorporated into the Characteristics. In his preface Tindal asserts that when he uses the word "clergy" in general, he does not mean "those who main- tain the Principles of our Establish'd Church: But the Popish, Eastern, Presbyterian, and Jacobite Clergy, (who are infinitely the Majority) as well as too many who pretend to be of the Chiurch of England, falling into Notions inconsistent with our Legal Establishment." 18 He asserts the principles of Erastianism against men of the school of Atterbury who zealously advocated the rights of the convocation and the independent authority of the church. On historical and legal principles, Tindal seeks to prove that the "Doctrine of Two Independent Governments, one belonging to the Clergy by Divine, the other to the King and Parliamenit by Human Right is inconsistent with the Constitution of the Establish'd Church." 17 This is in essence Shaftesbury's position as well, and also that of the Low Church clergy. It is a relatively simple matter for Tindal to prove that the Church actually does not exercise the abso- lute independence it claims, and, like Shaftesbury, he taunts the high-flyers for arrogating to themselves pow- ers they actually do not possess. Shaftesbury's ridicule of clergymen for claiming a divine commission is little more than a paraphrase of the following remarks of Tindal. A Clergyman, 'tis said, is God's Embassador, therefore the People neither Collective or Representative can make one, because they have no power to send Embassadors from Heaven. But taking Embassadors in that sense, it will, I'm afraid, prove there are now no Clergymen; since they 15 Mr. Toland's reflections on Dr. Sacheverell's sermon preach'd at St. Paul's, Nov. 5, 1709, 3-8, London, 1710. 16 Op.

Christ, and his Apostles, as they were com- mission'd by God, so they brought their Credentials with 'em visible to Mankind, viz. the Power of working Mira- cles: But what Credential, or what Mission can these Gen- tlemen pretend to? or what Gospel, never before known to the World, are they to discover? Are they not at the best only Commentators, Note-makers, or Sermon-makers on those Doctrines which the Embassadors of God once de- liver'd to the Saints? . . . But let them consider, if he who feigns a Commission from an Earthly King, and acts as his Embassador, without having Authority from him, de- serves a severe Punishment; what must they expect, who falsely pretend a Commission from Heaven, and to be no less than the Embassadors of God to Mandkind? 18 Shaftesbury's familiarity with Tindal's book and his implied accord with him on principles of church gov- ernment is attested to by a letter to Michael Ainsworth in which he remarks that "Dr. Tindal's principles, what- ever they may be as to church government, are in re- spect of philosophy and theology, far wide from the authors of the rhapsody" [referring to The Moralists].19 Tindal and Shaftesbury were irritated by clergymen who applied 2 Corinthians 5: 20 in their treatises on ecclesiastic authority or used it as a text for sermons. A good example of the latter is William Beveridge's "Ministers of the Gospel, Christ's Ambassadors," a sermon designed to prove that ministers in the pulpit are not ordinary human beings, but apostles or ambas- sadors of Christ. "We in our Church," he asserts, "by a successive imposition of hands, continued all along from the Apostles themselves, receive the same Spirit that was conferred upon them for the administration of the Word and Sacraments. . . For as they were, so are we, 'Ambassadors for Christ.'" 20 Clergymeni who answered Tindal associated his doc- trine with that of Hobbes just as later writers errone- ously compared Hobbes and Shaftesbury. William Whitefield, for example, maintained that two errors prevailed concerning the kingdom of Christ, the first, popery or invading the Rights of Mankind, under pretence of a Claim from Christ, (or perhaps of his Vicar,) to Earthly Do- minion and Property. -To these as well as to Pilat, our Lord says in my Text. My Kingdom is not of this World. -The other is no less pernicious in a contrary way; for it brings the Kingdom of Christ, (even as to those things wherein it consists,) under Subjection to the State; and will not allow the Powers of the one to be distinct from the Authority of the other. That Religion which the Prince Commands, (tho, of the Leviathan, [Leviath.] in- stead of the Gospel) is to be professed, and not that which Jesus Christ hath Instituted.2' Actually Tindal's principles are solidly based on the Reformation and the Revolution of 1688 and derive from Locke rather than Hobbes. Tindal's arguments 18 Ibid., 78-79. 19 Rand, ed., Life, 403. 20 Library of Anglo-Catholic theology 12: 200. 21 The Kingdom of Jesus Christ, 4, London, 1708. do have in common with Hobbes the denying of the independent authority of the ecclesiastical body as equal to the civil body, and Tindal does use many of Hobbes' arguments to establish this point. The fundamental difference, however, comes in regard to the attitude to- ward the magistrate. Hobbes, denying that the clergy function by divine right, maintains that the king and every other sovereign exercise their office by divine right.22 Consequently, the sovereign is the divinely- appointed head of the ecclesiastical body. According to Hobbes' political theology, the only articles necessary for salvation are faith and obedience. Faith is internal and invisible, but obedience is overt and apparent since it is accorded to God through obedience to the civil sovereign. Even though the sovereign be an infidel, Hobbes maintains, "every one of his own Subjects that resisteth him, sinneth against the Laws of God." Thus the church is nothing but an instrument to secure un- questioning obedience to the sovereign. This doctrine is essentially the same as the Tory doctrines of passive obedience and non-resistance which were preached by the nonjurors in Shaftesbury's time and which were entirely contrary to Shaftesbury's Whig principles. This Tindal himself pointed out. Between Hobbes and those who claim an independent power in church mat- ters, he observed, "how much soever they may rail at him, there's no other difference, than that he will have the Magistrate to judge for the People as well as him- self, but they would have both blindly follow them." 23 Tindal and Shaftesbury together with the moderates and latitudinarians in the Church go along with Hobbes in denying that the ecclesiastical body has an authority independent of the civil body, but deny that there is any one sole-commissioned church or ecclesiastical au- thority. They advocate the free exercise of religion and oppose both the use of religion as a servant of the mag- istrate, and the magistrate as a servant of religion. The contrary doctrine is asserted by Whitefield, who believes I. That Jesus Christ, as King and Law giver hath given proper Laws to his Church, and Enforc'd them with Penal Sanctions. II. That he hath appointed a distinct Order of Men, to Minister in Holy things in his Church. III. That he hath invested these his Ministers, with the sole Authority of admitting Members into his Church, and of excluding from its Communion. The second principle is the crucial one. Of it White- field affirms that above 1500 Years after Christ, none were suffer'd to officiate in Holy Things, and acknowledg'd by the Faith- ful, who were not thus admitted to the Ministry. Baptism by Lay Hands, was only in Case of absolute necessity; and then, not without License from the Governours of the Church: Absurdly therefore argued for, when there is no such necessity.24 22 Leviathan, Chap. 42. 23 Rights, 28. 24 Op. cit., 11.</page><page sequence="55">350 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISAI [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Tindal had introduced the practice of lay-baptism among the early Christians as a proof of the principle of his fourth chapter, "That 'tis inconsistenlt with tlle Reason, Design and End of Ecclesiastical Discipline, that there shou'd be any particular Imnntutable Formiii of it, or aniv Set of Persons *ith an Unalterable Right to manage it."^ The term "lay-baptism" came to stand for sacraments administered by anyone, including dissentilng clergymen, not ordained by the Church of England. i\Iost authori- ties give the year 1711 as the comllmencement of the coIn- troversy over lay-baptism and ascribe it to two tracts of Roger Lawrence, Lay-Baptismt Invalid and Sacerdotal Powers: or the Necessity of Confession. The subject was quite important earlier, however, in the answers to Tindal. Another important doctrine in the controversy over church authority was the one, attacked by Tindal in his ninth chapter, "that nione can be Bishops, except those who derive thleir Power by a conttinu'd anid uninter- rupted Succession in the Cathlolick Chlurch." In attack- iiig this doctrine, Tindal capitalizes on the disagreement among Anglican divines concerning the interpretation of the twenty-third article. According to Tindal, it "only in general Terms declares, Ministers are to be senlt by those whlio have publick Autthority, without de- termining who they are." 2 In support of his own view, Tindal quotes from Bishop Burnet's Exposition. There is not much Whitefield can say in reply except, And tho' in a late Exposition of this Article a Learned and Reverend Prelate (not quoted in his own Words by this Author,) says, "that this Authority and Power may be devolved upon the Prince or supreme Power, (who compre- hends virtually the whole People in him:) and that, even the People may have this Power, who (separating from a defil'd Worship) may choose some of their own Number to Minister in Holy things; and that this is not annull'd or condemn'd by this article. -Yet (with the lowest Sub- mission and Deference) I most Humbly propose that this cannot be Construed for the meaning of this Article (as it is an Article of the Church of Enzgland,) for the Reason; because in the Preface to the Form of Organization, &amp;c. it is expressly said 'That no Man shall be accounted or taken to be, a lawful Bishop, Priest, or Deacon, (. . .) except he be . . . admitted thereunto, accordinlg to the Form hereafter following, or hath had formerly Episcopal Ordination or Consecration.'" Among the many answers to Tindal, there is one, George Hickes's Two Treatises on the Christian Priest- hood (1709), that is of particular interest in relation to Shaftesbury. Hickes makes special mention of Tin- dal's ridiculing of the priesthood, for assuming the title of God's ambassadors "because they cannot work mir- acles to prove their mission." In reply, Hickes asks, "Is not this pleasant to hear an infidel, who laughs at miracles at one time, arguing from them at another?" 6 The same comment could, of course, be applied to Shaftesbury, as could the following reflections upon Tindal. 25 Op. cit., 338. 26 Prefatory discourse, Sec. XVI. They may as wvell require the credentials of miracles froni us for our doctrines, as well as for our mission, and equally reject both, because God doth not now bear us witness, as He did to our Lord, and His Apostles. . . . Our want of miraculous credentials equally affects both, and I doubt not but it was our author's intention that it should; but as he must give me leave to tell him that our mission is the same that it was in the beginning of the third century, when mira- cles were ceasing; so it is the same ever since they quite ceased. It is possible that Shaftesbury was aware of Hickes's treatises (in which by the way, his own early tracts are savagely assailed) and that in advising the clergy to "beware of accumulating too hastily those high charac- ters, appellations, titles, and ensigns of power, which may be tokens, perhaps, of what they may expect here- after, but which, as vet, do not answer the real power and authority bestowed on them," he was referring to Hickes's lists of "honourable titles and appellations an- ciently given to Christian bishops," of "words setting forth the eminent dignity and authority of the episcopal office," and of "words expressing the subjection and obedience due to them, both from clergy and laity."92 Hickes also uses the objectionable phrase from 2 Co- rinthians in comparing angels in heaven to priests on earth. Shaftesbury's caustic reference to "ambassadors from the Almighty" was taken up by Akenside in the lines from The Pleasures of Imaginiation prefixed to this chapter. Warburton indignantly characterized Aken- side's lines as "A poor joke of his Master's, and spoil'd too in the telling." 28 Shaftesbury's accompanying references to the dog- matism of the zealots who make it the highest crime "to hear an argument on a contrary side to theirs, or read whatever may be writ in answer to their particu- lar assertions" are as closely connected with actual events in ecclesiastical history. To make this clear, it is necessary to return to the Sacheverell case. The Whigs in Commons urged impeachment of Sacheverell on the grounds that his sermons were "Malicious, Scandalous, and Seditious Libels.""9 This, the Tories flatly denied. What concerned both houses of Parliament was the vote passed four years previously about the Church not being in danger. The friends of Sacheverell asserted that the Church always would be in danger, "not from Her Majesty's Administration, but from Papists on the one Hand, and Fanaticks on the other; from these Her profess'd Enemies, and from False Brethlren." To this, "little was return'd, besides bitter Invectives against the Sermons; and particularly, against the Doctrines of Passive-Obedience and Non- Resistance." The Whigs exerted superior voting pow- 27 See Hickes's index, Library of Aniglo-Catholic theology 50: xxiv. 28 Postscript to the Dedication to the Free-Thinkers, Divine Legationt, Hurd, ed., Works . . . of Warburton 1: 190, London, 1811. 29A,4; im,partial account of . . . the case of Dr. Henry Sachev- crell, 1, London, 1710.</page><page sequence="56">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 1951] THE MAGISTRATE 351 ers, and Sacheverell was brought to the House of Lords for trial. The third article of Sacheverell's impeachment charged him with "falsely and seditiously suggesting antd asserting, That the Churchl of England, is in a Conzdition of great Peril and Adversity under her Maj- esty's Admvinistration.'" In defence it was pleaded that the dangers spoken of in Sacheverell's sermon were "either such as arise from the Infidelity and Prophane- ness, the Vice and Immorality of the Age, or else such as always have attended the Christian Church from her first Foundation." To prove the reality of dangers from infidelity, the managers of Sacheverell's defense in- structed the clerk to read from published works con- taining "Blasphemies and impious Doctrines and Ten- ets" dangerous to the Church. Among these allegedly pernicious works was included Shaftesbury's A Letter concerning Enthusiasmn.3 There is little doubt that Shaftesbury was aware that excerpts from his work had been read aloud by the clerk in the House of Lords as an example of the in- fidelity and profaneness of the age. This explains in large measure his comment that to hear an argument on a contrary side to the clergy "or read' whatever may be writ in answer to their particular assertions, is made the highest crime." The last part of the charge made against Sacheverell is that "the Doctor asserts it is the Duty of superior Pastors to thunder ouit their Ecclesiastical Anathema's against Persons entituled to the Benefit of the Tolera- tion, and insolently dares or defies any Power on Earth to reverse such Sentences." 31 This intransigent zeal of Sacheverell probably had some part in Shaftesbury's reference to "this universal contention, embroil, and fury of religious challengers, these high defiances of contrary believers, this zealous opposition of commis- sion to commission, and this din of hell, anathemas, and damnations raised everywhere by one religious party against another." The Sacheverell trial was regarded' as a great tri- umph by the High Church party. So influential was it in political affairs that the Whigs resigned and the Tories came into office. In the general election which followed, the ecclesiastical question was of paramount interest as shown bY the following verses, typical of the party cries prevalent in the campaign. Join Church, join, and do not separate, Lest you repent when that it is too late: Low-Church Is No-Church.32 The subsequent political victory of the High Church is undoubtedly the basis of Shaftesbury's reference to the zealot-gentlemen being of late "so elated by some seem- 30 The Tryal of Dr. Henry Sacheverell, before the Houtse of Peers, for High Crimiies and Ml1isdemneanors, 218, London, 1710. 31 Ibid., 290. 32 The Obserz'ator (Oct. 14-18, 1710). inog advantages and a prosperity wlhich they are ill fitted to bear." There are other passages throughout the Character- istics which become clear when interpreted in the light of the historical events we have been discussing. When Shaftesbury describes some "new pretenders" to des- potic power "who would willing derive their authority" from the Roman Catholic Church "and graft on their successive right," he is undoubtedly castigating the high-flyers and nonjurors, particularly as he speaks of their effort "to give themselves the same air of inde- pendency on the civil magistrate" and their affectation of "the same authority in government, the same gran- deur, magnificence, and pomp in worship." In the same chapter Shaftesbury expresses his contemipt of High Church sacerdotalism by declaring that it is "but a vulgar species of enthusiasm which is imovedi chiefly by show and ceremony and wrought upon by chalices and candles, robes and figured dances." In Advice to an Author, possibly reflecting on the trends of the High Church party, he observes that the clergy have been "reduced by law or settled practice from the power they once enjoyed" and hopes they will not "in defiance of the magistrate and civil power, erect anew their stages and lists." " Further in Miscellaneous Reflections he points out that "groundless arraignments and suspicions, . . . un- necessary invectives, and bitter declamations, an(d . . . a contentious quarrelsome aspect of religion" is re- sponsible in part for the growth of scepticism.)5 "The very clamour itself," he observes, "joined with the usual menaces and show of force, is that which chiefly raises this sceptical spirit, and helps to multiply the number of these inquisitive and ill-humoured' critics." This is of the same nature as! Burnet's comment on the conduct of the Sacheverell trial and was probably inspired by the same events. According to Burnet, the collection of passages from books "full of crude impiety, anrd of bold opinions" gave "great offence to many. who thought that this was a solemin publishing of so much impiety to the nation, by which more miischief would be done than by the books themselves." 36 In the same section of Miscellaneous Reflectionis, Shaftesbury taunts the Church party for pretending to magisterial powers which it does not possess. It can "only become them to brandish such arms," he asserts, "when they have strength enough to make the magistrate resign his of- fice, and become provost or executioner in their serv- ice." Shaftesbury's repeated ridicule of the universi- ties throughout the Chlaracteristics is also explained by his Low Church sentiments. The Whigs in this period consistently attacked the universities as stronglhol(ds of Tory principles. 33 Robertson, 2: 215. 34 Ibid. 1: 233. 35Ibid. 2: 233. 36 Own Tinwe 2: 541.</page><page sequence="57">352 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Finally, the amusing retelling of the story of the apostle Paul's encounter with Diana of the Ephesians is merely a method of making the High Church cry of "the Church in danger" look ridiculous.37 It will be remembered that Sacheverell had been impeached! for perpetuating this cry in defiance of the official declara- tion that the Church was in no danger. Shaftesbury's "noted story" is a sly allegory in which the Ephesian temple represents the Church and the tumult in the city represents the Tory agitation over its alleged peril. Shaftesbury thus describes the conduct of the Ephesians as enthusiasm and a panic concern for the church, run- ning into "popular rage or epidemical frenzy." When their established church came to be called in ques- tion, we see in what a manner their zeal began to operate. All with one voice, about the space of two hours, cried out, saying, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians." At the same time this assembly was so confused, that the greater part knew not wherefore they were come together; and conse- quently could not understand why their church was in any danger. The native enthusiasm of the mob naturally engendered by panic, Shaftesbury continues, was stimulated by craftsmen, "strictly united in interest," who had been secretly called together and warned that their profes- sions and their temple on which their wealth depended were in danger because of the teaching of Paul that "they are no real Gods who are figured or wrought with hands." Shaftesbury includes a thrust at the Scriptures along with those directed against his spiritual adversaries. In commenting on the moderation of the "town clerk or recorder of the city," who had assured the people that everyone was acquiescent in their ancient worship and that no threat to their church was offeredi by the new sect, Shaftesbury mildly suggests that he was guilty of misrepresentation, if not falsehood. This, no doubt, was stretching the point sufficiently, as may be understood by the event in after time. One might, per- haps, have suspected this recorder to have been himself a dissenter, or at least an occasional conformist, who could answer so roundly for the new sect, and warrant the church in being secure of damage and out of all danger for the future. Shaftesbury may have conceived the idea for the Ephe- sian allegory from Tindall's reference in Rights of the Christian Church to the prospect of falling "under the Displeasure of some Ecclesiasticks even of the National Church, for striking at their Great Diana." 38 If further proof is needed that Shaftesbury is attack- ing particularly the High Church party, it is found in his letter to Lord Somers sent with the first impressions of the Characteristics. In describing his Miscellaneous Reflections, Shaftesbury says, I have courage . . . left to attack and provoke a most malignant Dartv with whom I might easily live on good 37Robertson, 2: 208-209. See Acts, 19. 38 Op. cit., 415. terms to all the advantage imaginable. Their blessed foun- tains of virtue and religion were never perhaps thus searched before. . . They who treated the poor Presby- terians as impolite, unformed, without rival literature or manners, will perhaps be somewhat moved to find them- selves treated in the same way, not as corruptions merely of morals and public principles, but as the very reverse or antipodes to good breeding, scholarship, behaviour, sense, and manners. For should this grow credible, and take either with our growing youth or their grown parents, I hope endowed seminaries might chance to make a much worse figure, and the October Club prove less considerable than at present in that height to which a modern statesman (not of their own kind) has . . . exalted in otur senate.A9 Compare with this denunciation of the High Church, his praise of the latitudinarian Burnet: as he has done more than any man living for the good and honour of the Church of England and the reformed reli- gion, so he now suffers more than any man from the ton- gues and slander of those ungrateful Churchmen, who may well call themselves by that single term of distinction, having no claim to that of Christianity or Protestant, since they have thrown off all the temper of the former and all conicern or interest wvith the latter.40 The political significance of Slhaftesbury's attack on the Church was so great that it contributed materially, in the opinion of the Earl of Nottingham, to the fall of the Whig ministry in 1710. His retrospective appraisal, which follows, of the political-religious situation in 1712 is an important document in the interpretation of the political passages of the Characteristics. It is not to be believed, howv much the Clergy were exas- perated all over the Nation, by the publick spreading of that pestilent, and, in truth, heathenish Book, called the Rights of the Church. The Ministry sat by, and the Parliament for a long while took no Notice of it. This inflam'd the Body of the Clergy: And tho' the most and the best Answers against it were written at the Command of Whiggish Bishops, or dedicated to them; yet since the Civil Power did not interpose in a Matter which so nearly concerned the Being of the Church, and the Maintenance of its Clergy, their Dissatisfaction was not lessen'd. The Impeachrnent of Dr. S 7 afterwards for a Point of Doctrine, made them lose all Patience. . . And when the Children of Darkness appeared above-board, when not only such little Scribblers as T[inda]l, C[olli]ns, A [sgil]l, and T[olan]d; but even some whose Birth and Quality gave them a Hereditary Place in our Parliament, appeared in Print against the Christian Religion, in De- fence of what they called Natural Liberty, and Free- thinking, as if his Quality gave any Man a sufficient Li- cense to brave the Lord of Hosts; . . . In truth I have often thought that the fall of that Ministry was a just judgment of God upon them for their Remissness in not giving what Check they could to the horrid Course of those vile and irreligious Books which appeared at that time.4' In view of this historical background, we may see what Shaftesbury means by his references throughout the Characteristics to his respect for religion "by law 39 Rand, ed., Life, 432. 40 Ibid., 421. 41 Observations upon the state of the nation in January 1712/3, 24, London, 1713.</page><page sequence="58">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 19511 THE MAGISTRATE 353 established." Every such reference is intended ironi- cally and is designed to ridicule the notion of establish- ing belief by law. In Advice to an Author, for example, Shaftesbury asserts that only those "to whom the state has assigned the guardianship and promulgation of the divine oracles" should concern themselves with the Christian mysteries and that "it becomes not those who are uninspired from heaven and uncommissioned from earth, to search with curiosity into the original of those holy rites and records by law established." 42 Should this attempt be made, he suggests, the evidence would confirm as true every belief which the law con- siders heresy and error. The only warrant for the "authority of our sacred symbols," he continues, is "the integrity, candour, and disinterestedness of their compilers and registers." Probably referring to the works of critics such as LeClerc and Toland, he asserts, But busy persons, who officiously search into these records, are ready even from hence to draw proofs very disadvan- tageous to the fame and character of this succession of men. And persons moderately read in these histories are apt to judge no otherwise of the temper of ancient councils than by that of later synods and modern convocations. Can anyone doubt that Shaftesbury's reverence for what is "by law established" is ironical, especially in view of his reference to "modern convocations"? Yet this is the passage cited by Lamennais as agreeing with the sentiment of Hobbes that religion is purely a politi- cal matter. Similar passages appear in Miscellaneous Reflections. In commenting on his mockery of modern miracles and inspiration in A Letter concerning Enthusiasm, Shaftes- bury asserts, almost certainly ironically, that he makes a rigid distinction between modern miracles and those of Scripture. "He pretends not," he says, "to frame any certain or positive opinion of his own, . . . but on all occasions submits most willingly, and with full con- fidence and trust, to the opinions by law established." 4 Likewise in a later section, he declares his absolute con- formity to the lawful church. In the same sentence in which he affirms the liberty of others to examine and search the mysteries of religion, he declares his "own steady orthodoxy, resignation, and entire submission to the truly Christian and catholic doctrines of our holy church as by law established." 44 The passage which seems most directly to surrender religious independence is in a speech of Philocles, the confirmed sceptic of The Moralists. Philocles says, I was always the first to comply on any occasion. . . I could never have the sufficiency to shock my spiritual and learned superiors. . . Whereas others pretend to see with their own eyes what is properest and best for them in reli- gion, we, for our parts, pretend not to see with any other than those of our spiritual guides. Neither do we presume 42 Robertson, 1: 231. 43Ibid. 2: 200-201. 44Ibid. 2: 352. to judge those guides ourselves, but submit to them as they are appointed us by our just superiors.45 This is not necessarily Shaftesbury's personal opinion, however, for in The Moralists, it is Theocles and not Philocles, the sceptic, who usually speaks for Shaftes- bury. Philocles represents the tradition of scepticism or "anti-rationalism," which was born in ancient Greece and which flourished in seventeenth-century England. In religion and politics, Pyrrhonism led frequently to conservatism or reaction. If we can know nothing, the Pyrrhonists reasoned, it is impossible to obtain stand- ards of conduct or truth. The best manner of life, therefore, is based on complete acquiescence in the established customs, economic system and religion of one's environment, regardless of their apparent absurdi- ties or injustices. In the thought of such sceptics as Montaigne, Pyrrhonism meant passive acceptance of the status quo. It is obvious then that Philocles does not represent Shaftesbury, who firmly believed in the real- ity and accessibility of truth and virtue. Leland and others who accused Shaftesbury of sharing Hobbes's views on religion and the magistrate, however, not both- ering to make a distinction between Theocles and Philo- cles, compared the attitude of the latter with Hobbes' assertion: Wherefore I purposely pass over the questions of infinite and eternal; contenting myself with that doctrine concern- ing the beginning and magnitude of the world, which I have been persuaded to by the holy Scriptures and fame of the miracles which confirm them; and by the custom of my country, and reverence due to the laws. And so I pass on to such things as it is not unlawful to dispute of.46 In various passages of their works, Shaftesbury and Hobbes do seem to agree that a man is justified in having both a private and a public belief in regard to religious doctrine. As Hobbes in Leviathan justifies the profession of faith to satisfy the command of a sov- ereign even if it means denying Christianity, Shaftes- bury seems to justify the profession of faith to conform to public custom even if it means affirming Christianity. There is a fundamental difference between the two writ- ers, however, in regard to the authority which may command a public faith; Hobbes allots this authority to the magistrate, but Shaftesbury assigns it only to public habit and custom. Shaftesbury's practice may give some insight into his actual personal opinion. In a private essay on enthu- siasm written to his brother he speaks of his attendance at church and receiving the Sacrament.

SOC. the contrary side such established rites of worship as w-ere so decent, chaste, innocent, pure; and had placed us in a religion and church where in respect of the moderate partv and far greater part the principle of charity was really more extensive than in any Christian or Protestant church besides in the worlds; . . . where a good and virtuous life, joined with a religious performanice of all sacred duties and a conformity with the established rites, was enough to answer the highest character of religion.47 This exhibits Shaftesbury in a saintly character and may be viewed with suspicion. Yet since it was written as a private missive to his brother and not intended for pub- lication, there is no real reason for doubting his sincer- ity. Whatever his feelings about receiving the Sacra- ment, Shaftesbury was a deist and enjoyed ridiculing the absurdities in orthodox interpretations of the Scrip- ture. Even if all of the foregoing passages from the Chlaracteristics are taken at their face value, however, they do not amount to an affirmation of the principles of Hobbes. Leland says w ith solmie justice that Shaftes- bury's pretended submission to "the holy writ by public authority established" places Christianity on a founda- tion which will serve the false religion as well as the true,48 but this is not enough to link him with Hobbes. Indeed Shaftesbury himself makes this same point, that when opinion is propagated by law, "Mahometism, Pa- ganism, Judaism or any other belief may stand as well as the truest upon this foundation." 49 Some unkind critics may say that if the foregoing passages are in- sincere, they represent an even more serious indictment of Shaftesbury than if they reflect the obnoxious prin- ciples of Hobbes. In Shaftesbury's defense, we may re- ply that irony is seldom regarded as equivalent to insin- cerity. So far have been cited only the passages whichn might possibly be construed as conformable to Hobbes' prin- ciples. Lest the preceding discussion of the ecclesi- astical background be insufficient to show that such a construction would be erroneous an-d contrary to Shaftesbury's intention, there follows a citation of passages from the Characteristics in which Hobbes' principle of the union of church and state is directly confuted. In the first place, Shaftesbury attributes the concept of "a public leading in religion" to Harrington, not to Hobbes.90 He is no enemy to the Establishment al- though he supports it with extremely faint praise, ask- ing "why should there not be public walks, as well as private gardens ?" 51 He continues with a condemna- tion of all attempts "to prescribe bounds to fancy and speculation, to regulate mein's apprehensions and re- ligious beliefs or fears, to suppress by violence the 47Rand, Life, xxvii. 48 Op. cit. 1: 63. 49 Robertson, 2: 220. 50 Robertson, 1: 14. 51 His language is stronger, however, in a comment on this passage in a private letter in which he asserts that "religion cannot be left . . .to shift for itself, without the care and coun- tenance of the magistrate." Letters, 30. natural passion of enthusiasm, or to enideavour to ascer- tain it, or reduce it to one species, or bring it under any one modification." 52 No doubt with the Higlh- Church-sponsored bills against occasional conformity in mind, he ridicules the fantastic project to obtain uni- formity in opinion as the only expedient against the mutual hatreds and animi-osities brought on by religious differences. An extremely veiled, but nevertheless direct, attack on the uniting of church and civil authority to procure conformity of religious opinion is found in Sentsus Coni- m,unis.53 The folly of this procedure is pointed at in a parable concerning the origin of the attempt to ren(ler "intellectual complexions uniform anid of a sort." As a result of joining politics and religioni, "the magistrate became a dresser, and in his turn iwas (Iressed too, as he deserved, when he had given tip his power to a new order of tire-men." This much is dlirected against giv- ing civil powers to religion rather than against giving control of religion to the magistrate, but the continua- tion of the parable reflects on any combination of the two forces. Although both agreed that absolute con- formity was essential, neither the magistrate nor the tire-men themselves could resolve which of the various modes was the exact true one. Imagine, now, wlhat the effect of this miiust nieeds be; when men become persecuted thus on every side about their air and feature, and were put to their shifts how to adjust and compose their mien, according to the right mode; when a thousand models, a thousand patterns of dress were cur- rent, and altered every now and then, upon occasion, ac- cording to fashioin and the humour of the tinies. The case against joining the powers of magistracy and religion is put even more strongly in The Moralists. Here Shaftesbury insists that differences in opinion should be settled by reason, not by force. He divides atheists into two groups, those who absolutely deny and those who only doubt. The first group, Slhaftesbury delivers up to the magistrate because they bear "an opinion against the interest of mankind and being of society." The second group, however, Shafteshury in- sists, must be reasoned with and persuaded by plhiloso- phy, with wlhich the language of the miiagistrate has little in common. "Nothing can he more unbecoming the magisterial authority than a philosophical style, and nothing can be more unphilosophical than a miagisterial one." 55 Shaftesbury's method of dealing with religious recalcitrants, therefore, is freedom of debate and fair- ness towards one's adversary. Shaftesbury's complete acquiescence in the principles of Hoadflv is revealed in a letter to his Drotege. Michael 52 Compare this with Hobbes's view "that in all things not contrary to the Morall Law, (that is to say, to the Law of Na- ture,) all Subjects are bound to obey that for divine Law, which is declared to be so, by the Lawes of the Common-wealth."

Shaftesbury cautions him against the conceit and pride of the priest- hood and emphasizes the supremacy of the civil power. "Remember," he exhorts, that HE, whom you own to be your Master and legislator, made no laws relating to civil power, or interfering with it. So that all the preheminence, wealth, or pension, which you receive, or expect to receive, by help of this assum'd character, is from the publick, whence both the authority and profit is derived; and on which it legally depends; all other pretensions of priests being Jewish and Heathenish, and in our state seditious, disloyal, and factious; such as is that spirit, which now reigns in our universities, and where the high-church-men (as they are call'd) are prevalent. But to this (thank GOD) our parliament, interposing at this instant, gives a check, by proceeding against Dr. S L, and advancing Mr. H Y, of whom I have often spoke to you.56 The last word which needs to be said on the subject of Shaftesbury's attitude toward' religion and civil au- thority is found in Shaftesbury's earliest published work, his preface to the volume of sermons by Benjamin Whichcote. Here he expressly declares himself against the conjunction of religion and politics, pointing out that the efficacy of preaching is reduced in proportion to its being at any time "serviceable to revolutions in state, or to the support of any other interest than that of Christ's kingdom." Neither government nor reli- gion gains by the union, Shaftesbury continues, "it hav- ing never yet appeared, that divinity has been greatly bettered by policy; or that policy has been any where mended by divinity." Not only does Shaftesbury de- clare himself against this principle, but he specifically cites Hobbes as one of those writers who have been forward in making this un- prosperous alliance, and building a political christianity; . . . who, whether he may have been serviceable any way to the civil government, or christian church; it may be concluded, at least, that he has done but very ill service in the moral world. Whatever may be said of the previous reasoning in this chapter based' on historical events, the above quota- tion seems to establish decisively that Shaftesbury held contrary opinions from Hobbes on the subject of reli- gion and the magistrate. It is admitted that the view that Shaftesbury was not an enemy to religion in gen- eral, but was contending particularly against the High Church party of his own time is largely conjectural, but if the evidence presented to support this view is valid, it will explain in addition one of the most perplexing problems in the interpretation of Shaftesbury's work, his apparently contradictory attitude toward Christian- ity. As Leland points out, passages may be produced, particularly from the preface to Whichcote's sermons, in which Shaftesbury expresses "very favourable senti- ments of Christianity," and in his Several Letters Writ- ten . . . to a Young Man in the University, "there are excellent sentiments and advices, and some which seem 56 Letters, 36. to discover a real regard for the Christian religion." There are also many sentiments agreeable to Christian- ity in the Characteristics, particularly the conclusion to Book I of An Inquiry that "the perfection and height of virtue must be owing to the belief of a God." The problem is to reconcile these passages with others in the Characteristics which, in Leland's words, seem "to be evidently calculated to cast contempt upon Christianity and the holy Scriptures." The apparent inconsistency is resolved in part if we are right in assuming that the passages in the Characteristics satirizing the clergy are motivated by Shaftesbury's identifying himself with the latitudinarian movement against the extreme views of the Church party. In one phase of his writing he is carrying on the ethical principles of Whichcote; in the other he is attacking the high-flying party with the most virulent weapons at his disposal. Although his caustic passages may be deemed un-Christian, they are no more sarcastic or un-Christian than some passages in the work of Swift and other clergymen. Unlike Swift, how- ever, Shaftesbury had no political or emotional loyalties to the established church. He undoubtedly respected the latitudinarian wing of the church as a salutary moral force in the community, but his rationalism kept him from accepting, even tacitly, the doctrines of orthodox Christianity. He was first of all a deist, and like many other deists, he believed in the distinction between a pri- vate and a public religion, perhaps his only common ground with Hobbes. Not only is the Characteristics founded on contrary principles from the Leviathan, but Shaftesbury con- stantly attacks Hobbes directly and by innuendo. Per- haps the most significant difference between Hobbes and Shaftesbury is in their attitude toward political and in- tellectual freedom, a difference not given much attention in the past. Even Cumberland and Cudworth, the chief opponents of Hobbes, have little to say about the threats to liberty in his system. Shaftesbury attacks Hobbes' advocacy of rigid intellectual censorship by the state by means of an allegory in Sensus Communis concerning the egregious customs and conduct of the magi.57 A person living in the time when the magi controlled much of Asia may, because of their odious conduct, have felt a desire to exterminate their whole race including every one of their houses and monuments. But, objects Shaftesbury, if the magi had collected a valuable body of learning or morals, would it be reasonable to con- demn and destroy it "for no other reason than merely because they had espousedi it"? By adopting such a policy, Shaftesbury continues, we would have flown at every religious and moral principle, denied every natural and social affection, and rendered men as much wolves as was possible to one another, while we described them such; and endeavoured to make them see themselves by far more monstrous and corrupt, than with the worst intentions it was ever possible for the worst of them to become. 57Robertson, 1- 59 ff.</page><page sequence="61">356 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Apart from the innuendos in this sentence directed against the selfish system of ethics, the entire allegory is an attack upon Hobbes's view that the sovereign may and should exercise rigid censorship of the press. In a footnote Shaftesbury exposes Hobbes's opposition to the teaching of classical languages on the ground that democratic notions of controlling the actions of sov- ereigns are drawn from Greek and Roman authors and condemns Hobbes's opinion that these books should be rigidly censored. The allegory of the magi has particu- lar reference to these authoritarian theories. Just as the opponents of the magi would be d,isplaying the great- est folly if they should destroy the learning and monu- ments of the magi out of abhorrence of some elements of their conduct, so Hobbes was as ridiculous in recom- mending "the very extinguishing of letters" out of ab- horrence of the "notion of liberty itself" caused by the Puritan government and the ravages of enthusiasm. Continuing in a spirit of raillery, Shaftesbury demon- strates at length the utter inconsistency of Hobbes. Unlike the magi, who seek to conceal their depraved practices by ostensibly espousing excellent moral rules and maxims, Hobbes pretends to be much worse than he actually is. Teaching "that both in religion and morals we were imposed on by our governors," that there are no impulses of love toward anything but our- selves, he, nevertheless, laboriously composed systems for general use and, despite his natural fear, continually ran the "highest risk of being a martyr for our deliver- ance." Were these principles true, it would be more logical for their proponents to conceal them and use them to their own advantage than to spread them abroad. There is really no danger, therefore, to be feared from the authors of this savage philosophy, for this free communication of their principles proves the height of sociableness. Knaves there are in the world, Shaftesbury recognizes, but the real knaves would never confess their true opinions. Real knaves "have no quarrel with religion or morals. . . . They are sure to preach honesty, and go to church." Shaftesbury pre- sents the charitable, but somewhat inadequate explana- tion that selfish systems and other paradoxes are ad- vanced, not because their advocates are fully satisfied with them, but so that they may, by the general scepti- cism they induce, indirectly oppose other dogmatic sys- tems which they feel have brought mankind under sub- jection. The phrase Sensus comnnunis, Shaftesbury uses to mean a sense of common interest in public weal rather than a sense of prudent judgment. In a way the whole treatise of that name is a riposte against Hobbes. Shaftesbury launches out particularly against authori- tarian systems of government by asserting that where there is absolute power there is no public, for those who live under a tyranny "have scarce a notion of what is good or just, other than as mere will and, power have determined." 58 This is a double protest, against both 58 Robertson, 1: 72. the political authoritarianism of vesting all rights in the monarch and the moral authoritarianism of resting all moral distinctions in the will of God. In spite of the worst despotism, Shaftesbury continues, there exists, even in the most tyrannical governments, a sense of community loyalty based upon the natural affection toward government and order. This general reflection on Hobbes's political scheme. Shaftesbury follows with a direct refutation of his the- ory of the origin of society. It is ridiculous, he main- tains, to assert an obligation to virtuous conduct in a fornmed government and not in the so-called state of nature. For, to speak in the fashionable language of our modern philosophy: "Society being founded on a compact, the sur- render made of every man's private unlimited right, into tlle hands of the majority, or such as the majority should appoint, was of free choice, and by a promise." If the promise was obligatory in the state of nature, Shaftesbury comments, it was so because man has an inherent sense of right and wrong, and his obligation to virtue thus exists prior to the formation of an arti- ficial community organization.59 Shaftesbury hereupon presents a theory of the development of society ex- actly contrary to that of Hobbes, a theory maintaining that the herding instinct or innate sense of fellowship brought mankind together in gradually increasing units through the family, the clan, the tribe and' finally, the public. Shaftesbury himself propounds a paradox, that this "herding principle" or "associating instinct" is ac- tually responsible for the divisions and violent factions in society. All men have a sense of social solidarity, but universal good, world brotherhood or even national in- terest are concepts too remote and abstract for some people. These find an outlet for the combining prin- ciple in parties and cabals within the larger unit. The social or sympathetic spirit, Shaftesbury continues, is nowhere exerted so vigorously as in war, which on the surface seems most savage, but in which "mutual suc- cour is most given, mutual danger run, and common af- fection most exerted and employed." Hobbes's theories of society are given further denun- ciation in The Mora-lists by means of a debate between Philocles, the devil's advocate, and Theocles, who pre- sents Shaftesbury's approved view.60 Speaking for Hobbes, Philocles asserts that it cannot be said that man is by nature sociable, for if men entered society by compact they must have found their previous con- dition, without society, endurable since they actually lived so. If they entered society, not from natural in- clination, but from particular circumstances, the state of nature must be a state of war, men being disinclined to meet for love, but eager to fight for interest. The- 59 This reasoning had been used earlier by Cumberland, Maxwell, ed., Chap. V, Sec. 39, and by Samuel Clarke, A dis- course concerning the unchangeable obligations of natural relig- ion, 78, London, 1766. 60 Robertson, 2: 78 ff.</page><page sequence="62">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 19511 CONTROVERSIAL THEOLOGY 357 ocles, however, denies that if we suppose a state of men in which they were unassociated, unacquainted and without language or art, it could be called their natural state. When a man is divested of his natural affections, he is no longer a man any more than is a human em- bryo. If man has existed from eternity, there could be no other state of nature than the one existing now. "If not from eternity, he arose either all at once (and con- sequently he was at the very first as he is now) or by degrees, through several stages and conditions, to that in which he is at length settled." If we accept this evo- lutionary hypothesis, man as such cannot be considered to have existed until the creature reached the social stage. "Either there must be reckoned a hundred dif- ferent states of Nature, or if one, it can be only that in which Nature was perfect, and her growth complete." The second argument against the state of war theory is based on the physical structure or anatomy of man, which, Theocles affirms, determines him to be social. From the simple act of procreation, followed by care of the progeny, arises affection for the tribe, the nation and ultimately for all society. The last step is as natu- ral as the first. Theocles concludes sardonically that he has no objection to speaking ill of the imaginary state of nature, for it fosters the principles of society and banishes the inducements to asceticism. He is not really alarmed by the "transformers of human na- ture who, considering it abstractedly and apart from government or society, represent it under monstrous visages of dragons, leviathans, and I know not what devouring creatures." Finally, Theocles interposes an objection to the truth of their maxim "that man is to man a wolf" on the ground that wolves are very kind and affectionate to other wolves. He revises the maxim to read "that man is naturally to man, as a wolf is to a tamer creature," which, he asserts, is saying no more than that there are two kinds of men, the oppressors and -the oppressed. He concludes his comments on Hobbes' maxim with an observation that could be ap- plied equally to Mandeville's famous paradox a few years later, that "A virulent maxim in bold expressions, though without any justness of thought, is readily re- ceived for true philosophy."

Up to this point we have been treating fundamental notions which cannot be separated from Shaftesbury's system of deism, but which are not necessarily incon- sistent with Christianity. Although Shaftesbury was alone in combining these notions as he did, there were many sincere Christians who held, one or more of Shaftesbury's doctrines concerning the moral nature of man and the order of the universe. As I have previ- ously suggested, the one element which conclusively separates a latitudinarian Christian from a deist is a strong current of anti-Biblicism. For several reasons, Shaftesbury did not attack the Scriptures with the fe- rocity of Paine, but there are many passages in the Characteristics strongly critical of revelation and of the Christian clergy. Without these passages the Charac- teristics probably would never have been considered a deistical work. In treating controversial theological subjects, Shaftes- bury resembles Bayle in his use of extreme irony al- though he rarely assumes Bayle's air of ultra-orthodoxy. Frequently he speaks out with a moral earnestness rarely encountered in Bayle. By using irony and by veering constantly from ridicule to seriousness, Shaftes- bury protects himself from the charge of infidelity. Also by this means, according to his adverse critics, he eludes the arguments of the defenders of Christianity and at the same time artfully enregisters himself among the number of faithful Christians. Among the most important aspects of theological con- troversy in Shaftesbury's works are the notions con- cerning rewards and punishments and the use of ridi- cule in religion. There have been more words lavished on these two themes than on the entire remaining body of the Characteristics, but for the moment we shall con- sider only those which Shaftesbury took cognizance of. Day's treatise on future rewards was serious and well mannered, and Shaftesbury thus accords it polite treat- ment in The Moralists. It was a quite different story, however, in regard to the answers to A Letter concern- ing Enthusiasm. These angry pamphlets throw consid- erable light upon Shaftesbury's remarks in Miscellane- ous Reflections concerning polemic divinity and the tribe of answerers. If they are interpreted as broad asper- sions upon clergymen in general, Shaftesbury appears as a bitter enemy of all religion, but if they are seen as a contemptuous dismissal of inept attacks on his own published work, he appears as a somewhat less formida- ble foe. It was because of these clerical attacks that Shaftes- bury introduced his comments in the second chapter on the "writing church-militant." He offers the ridicu- lousness of gladiatorial divines as his reason for refus- ing to reply to his own adversaries. Nothing of endur- ing merit is ever produced in these mighty controversies, he says, and they are profitable only to booksellers. Shaftesbury compares a bookseller who sets on excited divines to write against each other to a crafty glazier who on a frosty morning tosses a football to urchins for them to kick about, with the result that much of the glass in the neighborhood is broken. His own printer, he says, has pestered him with copies of the Renmarks and Reflections as bait to prepare a reply, but he has astutely put him off by suggesting that they wait for his adversary's second edition, which he knows will</page><page sequence="63">358 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM ITRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. never come.' After this display of indifference toward the zealots of his own country, Shaftesbury emphasizes his contempt by showing live interest in what "the for- eign and more impartial critics" had said about his treatise, referring to the translation of Coste and the reviews of LeClerc.2 Later, in the second chapter of the fifth miscellany, Shaftesbury gives attention to the "new-fashioned theo- logical essays" in dialogue form. Ironically Shaftes- bury observes that these reverend authors, having been seduced by the way of raillery and wit, may, "perhaps, find means to laugh gentlemen into their religion, who have unfortunately been laughed out of it." The trou- ble with these dialogues, Shaftesbury continues, is that the characters have no verisimilitude or personality and all speak in the "figurative metaphorical style and rhetorical manner of the pulpit." Also they are mere puppets in presenting the opinions of their author. Although "they bear different titles, and are set up to maintain contrary points, they are found, at the bottom, to be all of the same side." The ostensible proponent of the adverse side makes the feeblest possible argu- ments in his defense, and in the end tamely lies down "and passively submits to the killing strokes of his, un- merciful conqueror." This is probably not a direct re- flection on Censura Temporumri because in these dia- logues the sceptics or heterodox are not allowed to speak in their own persons, their writings being at- tacked by critics of a single mind. Shaftesbury's target may be the oft-repeated Conference With A Theist (1696) by William Nichols, a collection of dialogues between a Christian, Credentius, who victoriously ex- pounds his views, and a theist, Philologus, who raises objections to Christianity, but is finally defeated and converted. Almost apocalyptically, Shaftesbury is de- scribing in amusing detail the style and method of Berkeley's Alciphron (1732) .3 Berkeley himself admits to some misrepresentation of Shaftesbury's views. In his "Advertisement" he de- fends his forcing his characters to extreme views on the ground that he is reporting conversation, which always goes beyond literal texts. Berkeley is guilty also of a more deliberate perversion of meaning, of which one concrete example will suffice. In the seventh dialogue, he accuses Shaftesbury of denying the freedom of will by asserting that the will "above all others must be al- 1 A second edition of An Enquiry after Wit was published in 1722. 2 Ennemond Casati, Herauts et Commentateurs de Shaftes- bury en France, Revue de Litterature Compare'e 14: 615-645, 1934. 3 In 1734 appeared A Vindication of the Reverend D B y, from the scandalous Im putation of being Author of a late Book, intitled, Alciphron, or, the Minute Philosopher. To which is subioined, The PREDICTIONS of the late Earl of Shaftesbury concerning that Book. The "Predictions" con- sist of Shaftesbury's ridicule of the dialogue method in the hands of orthodox divines. lowed the most slavish faculty." As proof he quotes from Soliloquy: Appetite, which is elder brother to Reason, being the lad of stronger growth, is sure, on every contest, to take the advantage of drawing all to his own side. And Will, so highly boasted, is at best merely a top or football between these youngsters, who prove very unfortunately matched; till the youngest, instead of now and then a kick or lash bestowed to little purpose, forsakes the ball or top itself, and begins to lay about his elder brother. Actually this passage has nothing to do with free will opposed to necessity, as Berkeley implies, but is con- cerned solely with the relative influence of appetite and reason. Had Berkeley given a complete quotation, add- ing Shaftesbury's change of emphasis, "For the elder, like an arrant coward, upon this treatment, presently grows civil, and affords the younger as fair play after- wards as he can desire," Shaftesbury would have been revealed as presenting the supremacy of reason over appetite, a system quite the contrary of the necessitarian one. Berkeley pretends to refute Shaftesbury by means of the principle that moral beauty cannot be found in a world without design. His implication that this prin- ciple is antithetical to Shaftesbury's system is manifestly unfair. Although Alciphron in the third dialogue is intended to represent Shaftesbury, Euphranor, in speak- ing against Alciphron, repeats arguments identical with Shaftesbury's vindication of moral order in An Inquiry. The point of departure is found elsewhere. Berkeley says that the world is not beautiful or moral unless a future state exists to punish and reward. Shaftesbury says that the world is beautiful and moral in itself. It has been pointed out with some justice that Shaftes- bury advocates the use of wit and humor in religious matters and then damns the divines who have the temer- ity to use these weapons against him, although it must be granted on Shaftesbury's side that for the most part they do not use them well. Similarly Shaftesbury him- self uses the dialogue form, but ridicules the divines who also use it. It is not surprising, therefore, that in his third treatise, Soliloquy: or Adzvice to an Author, which is, as the title informs us, a literary soliloquy, Shaftes- bury levels the charge of indecency against anyone who publishes "his meditations, occasional reflections, soli- tary thoughts, or other such exercises as come under the notion of this self-discoursing practice," particularly if he should be a clergyman. "Religious crudities are undoubtedly the worst of any," Shaftesbury continues, and "a saint-author of all men least values politeness." 4 Beyond this, he accuses them of insincerity in preparing solitary meditations for the press, and of slovenly style in neglecting all considerations of good breeding and the rules of criticism. Even more caustic than his reference to living divines are his allusions to Scriptural traditions and doctrines. Somewhat in the manner of twentieth-century debunk- ing biographers, Shaftesbury re-tells the stories of vari- 4Robertson, 1: 110.</page><page sequence="64">VOL. 41. PT. 2. 19511 CONTROVERSIAL THEOLOGY 359 ous Scriptural heroes, ascribing to them characteristics completely different from those accorded them by tra- dition. In this he was preceded by Bayle and to a much lesser degree by English deists, who had not progressed much, however, beyond laughing at Balaam's ass and at Samson's locks. In connection with the rite of cir- cumcision, Shaftesbury indirectly accuses the Scriptures of contradiction and historical inaccuracy.5 He scoffs at the tradition that Abraham received knowledge of the rite as a symbol of divine favor by citing authorities to prove that circumcision had been practiced in Egypt long before the time of Abraham and by suggesting that Abraham, when driven to Egypt by famine, had com- plied with the religious customs of the Egyptians as the price of his bread and maintenance. In tracing the subsequent history of circumcision, Shaftesbury implies that the Scriptural versions are completely at odds. Although Shaftesbury does not cite Genesis 17 in which circumcision is announced as a sym- bol of the covenant between God and the race of Abra- ham, he implies that it is contradicted by Joshua 5: 3 and Exodus 4: 18-26 in which circumcision is treated, according to Shaftesbury's interpretation, as a purely Egyptian rite to which the Israelites conformed for the sake of amicable relations.6 Shaftesbury's general purpose in treating the Penta- teuch is to point out "the strange adherence and servile dependency of the whole Hebrew race on the Egyptian nation" and thus to insinuate that the traditions of Christianity were established upon the occult sciences, judicial astrology and other arts proper to the Egyptian magi. In reference to the exodus under Moses, Shaftes- bury asserts that in spite of the continued direction and aid of heaven, the Israelites "inclined so strongly to the manners, the religion, rites, diet, customs, laws and constitutions of their tyrannical masters, that it was with the utmost difficulty they could be withheld from returning again into the same subjection." In the notes he quotes various ancient historians to support the view that they did not depart voluntarily, as reported in the Scriptures, but that they were forcibly expelled because of the leprosy prevalent among them. In Advice to an Author, Shaftesbury alludes to another unsavory cir- cumstance of the exodus, the retreat of Moses "by the assistance of an Egyptian loan." 7 In animadverting on the "stubborn habit and stupid humour" of the Is- raelites, a shocking phrase to orthodox English ears which were accustomed to hearing the Hebrew patri- archs highly praised and reverenced, Shaftesbury takes the opportunity of citing an even more shocking concept from Scripture, that the Divine Providence gave them laws "which he himself approved not." 8 5Robertson, 2: 189 ff. 6 The argument that the foundation of Hebrew rites was bor- rowed from the Egyptians was apparently familiar before the Characteristics. William Nichols answers it in A conference with a Theist 1: 294-296, 3d ed., London, 1723. 7 Robertson, 1: 230. 8 Ezekiel 20: 25; Robertson, 2: 191. Shaftesbury uses a variation of his method of drawing analogues between acknowledged superstitious enthusi- asm and established Christian doctrines by suggesting that the wisdom of Moses and other Hebrew leaders lay in their knowledge of magic and sorcery derived from Egyptian priests [Exodus 7: 11, 22; 8: 7]. In describ- ing the rise of Joseph, Shaftesbury asserts that he be- came "so powerful in this kind of wisdom, as to outdo the chief diviners, prognosticators and interpreters of Egypt." As he continues with the career of Joseph, Shaftesbury presents him as an opportunist, a sycophant and an exploiter of the underprivileged. He raised himself to be chief minister to a prince, who, following his advice, obtained in a manner the whole prop- erty, and consequently the absolute dominion of that land. But to what height of power the established priesthood was arrived even at that time, may be conjectured hence: "that the crown (to speak in a modern style) offered not to meddle with the church lands"; and that in this great revo- lution nothing was attempted, so much as by way of pur- chase or exchange, in prejudice of this landed clergy, the prime minister himself having joined his interest with theirs, and entered by marriage into their alliance.9 As Richard Hooker admits in an essay devoted to refut- ing Shaftesbury and vindicating Joseph, there is nothing in this account that is directly false, but he adds that neither is there anything strictly true, the whole episode being misrepresented.10 Shaftesbury gives a wrong idea of things, Hooker maintains, by hinting of Joseph's dealings with the Egyptian diviners and by speaking of the Egyptian priesthood in a modern style, in such phrases as "established priesthood" and "landed clergy." Against these innuendoes, Hooker affirms that Joseph's magical powers were not human skills, but supernatural and divine, and that the privileged position of the Egyp- tian priesthood had nothing in common with the Eng- lish clergy, for the Egyptian priests were at the same time nobles and held their lands by virtue of their nobil- ity, not their priesthood. To the success story of Joseph, Shaftesbury joins the observation that Moses emulated his predecessor's pol- icy of alliance with the Egyptian priesthood and the insinuation that Moses' political leadership rested on the skills of divining, soothsaying and magic. Shaftes- bury follows up this uncomplimentary allusion with the assertion that although Moses is described as "the meek- est man on earth" [Numbers 12: 2], he is also reported to have enforced the observation of religious duties with blood and massacre [Exodus 32: 27 ff.; Numbers 16: 41 ].11 Shaftesbury pretends to justify the harshness of Moses by calling attention to the extreme ill humor of his people, but his iconoclastic meaning is apparent. His attitude toward the "manners, actions and char- acters of Sacred Writ" is revealed in an ironical passage describing them as "matters incomprehensible in phi- Robertson, 2:193. 10 Weekly Miscellany, No. 202, Nov. 6, 1736. 11 Robertson, 2: 227.</page><page sequence="65">360 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. losophy, . . . above the pitch of the mere human his- torian, the politician, or the moralist." This generali- zation is prefaced with a concrete illustration of the character of David. It would be impossible by all the art of poetry, Shaftesbury affirms, to make that royal hero appear amiable in human eyes, who found such favor in the eye of Heaven. Such are mere human hearts that they can hardly find the least sympathy with that only one which had the character of being after the pattern of the Almighty's.12 The Scriptural narrative of David had been treated with great freedom in the Dictionary by Bayle, who suggests the possibility of David's being illegitimate, notices the inconsistencies concerning Saul's failure to know David on the day of the contest with Goliath, and suggests that the two accounts of David's magnanimity and Saul's ingratitude are two versions of the same thing. Shaftes- bury treats the character of David in Bayle's manner, but develops an original theme to make him appear lu- dicrous, the religious ecstasy with which he was seized in ceremonials and in prophesying. In contrast to the melancholy Saul, David was a "hearty espouser of merry devotion." The famous entry or high dance performed by him, after so conspicuous a manner, in the procession of the sacred coffer, shows that he was not ashamed of expressing any ecstasy of joy or playsome humour which was practised by the meanest of the priests or people on such an occasion.13 In the notes Shaftesbury expatiates on the extreme abandon with which this dance was performed and sug- gests that unrestrained enthusiasm is a concomitant of the spirit of prophecy. Though this dance was not performed quite naked, the dancers, it seems, were so slightly clothed that, in respect of modesty, they might as well have worn nothing, their nakedness appearing still by means of their high caperings, leaps, and violent attitudes. . . The reader, if he be curious, may examine what relation this religious ecstasy and naked dance had to the naked and processional prophecy (I Sam. xix, 23, 24), where prince, priest, and people prophesied in conjunction, the prince himself being both of the itinerant and naked party. This theme was taken up and developed by Thomas Morgan, in The Moral Philosopher, and both Shaftes- bury and Morgan were answered by Leland.14 The entire force of Shaftesbury's ridicule, Leland charges, consists in the connotation of such words as merry de- votion, high danice, and practised by the meanest of the people. Actually, Leland asserts, everything in the sacred dance was noble, grand, manly, and divine, and the words play and dance carried among the ancients nothing of the idea of unseemliness and levity in divine worship which they conjured up for Shaftesbury's read- 12 Ibid. 1: 230. 13Ibid. 2: 228. 14 The divinie authority of the Old and New Testament as- serted . . .against . . . the moral philosopher 1: 291-300, Lon- don, 1739. ers. Leland observes that Shaftesbury gives us as par- ticular a description of the dance as though he had been present himself, but he has no authentic record of it or of the clothing worn. Leland affirms that a long linen robe was worn, that all was reverent and august, aind that there is nothing said in Scripture about prophesy- ing being accompanied by dancing, Shaftesbury's ac- count being based only on his own fruitful imagination and prejudices. Here also the ridicule lies not in the thing in itself, "but in the Expressions this noble Author in his great Command of Words is pleased to throw in." In the story of Jonah, however, Shaftesbury does find ample source for ridicule in the thing in itself, not in the famous episode of the fish's belly, but in the char- acter of the prophet.15 Jonah is described as "pettish. . . . unlike a man, and resembling . . . some refrac- tory boyish pupil," who is humored by God, as a kind tutor. Shaftesbury traces his career in detail, showing him petulant and churlish at God's decision to spare Nineveh, and draws particular attention to the last verse of the book in which God is represented as showing more "tenderness to the very cattle and brute-beasts, than the prophet to his own human kind." Shaftes- bury's ostensible purpose in introducing the story of Jonah is to illustrate the indulgence of the Almighty together with the mildness and good humor wlhich He exhorts. As he cites other instances of (livine good humor, however, it is apparent that his real purpose is to expose the primitive anthropomorphism of the Scrip- tures. This is undoubtedly his intention in referring to the "popular pleasant intercourse, and manner of dia- logue between God and man [Gen. 3: 9 if.]: I miiight add, even between man and beast [Numbers 22: 28]; and what is still more extraordinary, between God and Satan [Job Chap. 1 and 2; 2 Chron. 18: 18-19]." Shaftesbury finds good humor even in "our Saviour's style" and "merry miracles" and refers, no doubt mla- liciously, to the first-recorded miracle of turning water into wine [John 2: 11]. He also represents the gift of tongues described in the second chapter of Acts as an effect of melancholy and inebriation.16 Immediately after expatiating on the pleasantry and humor of the Jewish and Christian religions, Shaftesbury proceeds to hint that the "dark part of superstition, whiclh among many other horrors produced that of humian sacrifice" might be found in the stories of Abraham and Jeph- thah.2 This is an obvious inconsistency, as is likewvise his earlier description of David as a "hearty espouser of the merry devotion" and of the Hebrews as having "in religion as in everything else, the least good humor of any people in the world." Shaftesbury was probably untroubled by this inconsistency, for the theme of good humor was undoubtedly a subterfuge to permit his sharp ridicule of the ScriDtures. 15 Robertson, 2: 229 ff. 16 1bid. 2: 198. 17 Ibid. 2: 232.</page><page sequence="66">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 19511 CONTROVERSIAL THEOLOGY 361 In Soliloquy Shaftesbury accuses "the sacred vol- umes" of crudity and moral simplicity. Although the comment that "our holy religion . . . is adapted to the very meanest capacities" could be taken in a com- plimentary sense, Shaftesbury's intention is opposite, to show that the ethics as well as the science of the Scriptures is on a primitive level.18 He asserts that the "moral appearances are in many places preserved with- out alteration, according to vulgar prejudice, and the general conception of interest and self-good" and that human nature is alternately assumed to be ambitious, "fond of power and glory," or childish, taken with vain show and "invited to obedience by promise of finer habitations, precious stones and metals, shining gar- ments, crowns, and other such dazzling beauties, by which another earth, or material city, is represented." According to Shaftesbury's exegesis, "the best doctrine could not go down without a treat, and the best disciples had their heads so running upon their loaves, that they were apt to construe every divine saying in a belly sense." In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries one of the strongest proofs offered of the divinity of Christ and the authority of the entire Christian religion was that of the miracles recorded in the Old and New Testa- ments. Divines such as Tillotson, South, Barrow, and Baxter repeatedly asserted the miracles to be the prin- cipal-confirmation of Christian teaching. This view is the keystone of Charles Leslie's Short and Easy Method with the Deists (1679), which became a classic in the confutation of deism. A matter of religious fact may be proved true, according to Leslie, if it satisfies the following conditions: (1) that the matter of fact be such as men's sense may perceive and judge, (2) that it be done publicly, in sight of the world, (3) that pub- lic monuments and observances be established and main- tained in honor of it, (4) that such monuments and observances commence from the time the matter of fact was done. This supposedly infallible rule was attacked by LeClerc and others on the ground that the proofs demanded are just as applicable to falsehood as to truth.19 Apart from the fact that our senses may be deceived, it is quite possible for miracles to be performed by a malicious as well as by a divine power. Although some clergymen to avoid this consequence argued that none but God can work a true miracle, the generality of divines maintained that demonic powers share mirac- ulous powers. One of the underlying purposes of A Letter concern- itg Enthusiasm is to discredit the argument from mir- acles by implying that Scriptural miracles rested on no firmer basis than the pretended ones of Lacy and the French prophets. Shaftesbury does not dare, however, openly to impugn the evidence of miracles. On the sur- face he distinguishes between modern and Scriptural miracles, rejecting the former as mockeries, and ironi- 18Ibid. 1: 183. 19 Bibliotheque Choisie 8: 349, 394-395, 1706. cally accepting the latter on the authority of the church. In Sensus Communis he ridicules the modern zealots who "appear to have no better knowledge of truth, nor better manner of judging it, than by counting noses." 20 By this rule, he asserts, any popular superstition or wild fancy may be verified as absolute truth, and religion is set on the foot of popular tradition. Shaftesbury may be alluding particularly to Lacy and the modern proph- ets, but he probably has reference as well to all who rest the principles of religion upon miracles. Unlike the later sceptics, Shaftesbury does not attack any particu- lar Scriptural miracles, but, going more directly to the point, asserts that miracles, even if proved true, had nothing to do with establishing the doctrines with which they are associated. The subject is introduced in The Moralists by Philocles, who describes a conversation on supernatural subjects filled with references to spirits and apparitions, monstrous births, prodigies, enchant- ments, elementary wars, and convulsions.21 Because of a footnote in Miscellaneous Reflections which treats this passage and another in A Letter concerning Enthusiasm as parallel, it may be assumed that Shaftesbury is de- scribing the adherents of Lacy and the French proph- ets.22 Philocles attributes their zeal for prodigies to a "passion for novelty and surprise, joined with a desire of making impression, and being admired," but charita- bly ascribes their excesses to delusion and love of won- der rather than imposture. In response to the grave gentleman who wonders whether this moderate faiti allows for belief in any miracles whatever, Philocles re- plies that he may go to any lengths in doubting modern miracles provided that he "have a right faith in those of former times, by paying the deference due to Sacred Writ." Only this exercise of incredulity, he asserts, will secure him against the false prophets and their de- luding miracles and against heresy and false religion. Having established his faith in Christianity by past mir- acles and needing no further confirmation, he declares that the belief in new miracles can do him no good, but may do harm by leading him into false sects; therefore the best maxim is "that miracles are ceased." This po- sition was perfectly orthodox; Tillotson had declared that the miracles had ceased because the Gospel doc- trine, after once becoming accepted, could be propa- gated by reason,23 and South had declared that although miracles continued beyond Scripture times, they ceased shortly after, the scaffolding being torn down after the completion of the superstructure.24 After presenting the gist of these arguments, Shaftesbury allows the grave gentleman to express the opposite view, that if we have no confirmation of Scriptural miracles by mod- ern ones, we are under no compulsion to believe there ever were any. Modern miracles, he asserts, represent 20 Robertson, 1: 98. 21 Ibid. 2: 84 if. 22 Ibid. 2: 200. 23 Sermons 2: No. V, Londoni, 1700. 24 Sermon XXXV.</page><page sequence="67">362 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. "'God witnessing for himself," not "men for God," which is the situation when we must rely on human testimony from the past. Shaftesbury is obviously bringing together these contrary opinions in such a way as to lead to the conclusion that there are not at the present and never were any true miracles. Lest this be insufficient he reminds his readers that miracles may just as well be the work of demons and evil spirits as of God, an opinion found not only in the works of Bayle and other sceptics, but also in many orthodox sermons and treatises, including the answers to A Letter con- cerning Enthusiasm. So far Shaftesbury is only sparring, but his last two arguments against miracles, intimately associated with his fundamental beliefs concerning God and the uni- verse, are presented earnestly. Neither the historical record nor modern miracles can attest to the being of God, he asserts. Instead, the rational "contemplation of the universe, its laws and government" is "the only means which could establish the soundf belief of a deity." Innumerable miracles would have absolutely no efficacy in this direction, but would merely prove the existence of certain powers, but whether these powers be one or several, mortal or immortal, good or bad, remains a mystery. Only by goodness may superior powers win belief, and this belief must be established upon an examination of their works and actions. "To whom therefore the laws of this universe and its government appear just and uniform, to him they speak the govern- ment of one Just One; to him they reveal and witness a God." 25 Shaftesbury's final argument is that miracles, far from attesting to a divine providence and order in the universe, actually assert the opposite. A miracle, by definition, would break the uniformity in the world, "'and destroy that admirable simplicity of order from whence the one infinite and perfect principle is known." Those who assert miracles really contradict the order in the universe and, consequently, deny the existence of God; furthermore they breed atheism, for the inquiring youth who is taught to seek variations and breaches of law as a proof of divinity, and upon careful examination finds not confusion, but order, uniformity and constancy, is thereby driven to atheism.26 Of even more importance to Christian evidence than miracles was the authenticity of the Scriptural record, a subject which Shaftesbury introduces with the "known saying of a famed controversial divine of our Church against the divines of another, 'that the Scripture, the Scripture, was the religion of Protestants.' " 27 Shaftes- bury impugns both miracles and Scripture by indirectly showing their interrelationship. Even before Shaftes- bury, the Boyle lecturers were indignantly repudiating -5 Robertson, 2: 92. 26 This argument had been used by Spinosa: Tractat. Theo- logico-politico, Chap. VI. Spinosa is cited by Cudworth, In- tellectual system 2: 123. 27 Robertson, 2: 354. This is a reference to William Chilling- worth's The religion of Protestants, a safe way to salvation. the charge that in orthodox forensics the doctrine is proved by the miracles and the miracles by the doctrine. Shaftesbury changed the formula to state that the Scrip- ture is proved by the miracles and the miracles by the Scripture. After a paraphrase of John 5: 31, which Shaftesbury converts from the particular statement "If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true," to the general "That in what we bear witness only to our- selves, our witness cannot be established as a truth," he asserts that since there are no contemporary miracles in behalf of Holy Writ and that since there is nothing miraculous or self-convincing in its style, without the collateral evidence of ancient records and historians, there would be little to refute the natural argument that the holy records themselves were no other than the pure invention or artificial compilement of an interested party in behalf of the richest corporation and most profit- able monopoly which could be erected in the world.28 Although on the surface Shaftesbury seems to be argu- ing for a type of higher criticism (the corroboration of contemporary records) as the primary defense of reve- lation, actually he is defending historical criticism be- cause of its opposite effect. His inference concerning "the richest corporation and most profitable monopoly" naturally shocked his pious readers, although as Brown points out, Shaftesbury seems to disaVow the notion while impressing it on his readers' imagination. Brown presents the best argument that can be brought against the notion as it applies to Christianity, that it implies that one group of men suffered imprisonment, torments and death so that another group centuries after might enjoy the profit of monopoly and church preferment.29 The notion must have been prevalent before Shaftes- bury, for Dryden refutes it with reasoning parallel to Brown's: Shou'd all conspire how or why to cheat us with a Lye? Unask'd their Pains, ungrateful their Advice, Starving their Gain and Martyrdom their Price. Religio Laici This reasoning protects the good name of the primitive Christians, but it is the later development of Christian- ity as an organized body which is Shaftesbury's primary target. He emphasizes the priesthood as a vested in- terest established upon privilege, wealth, and hereditary right. Its parasitic control of society could be main- tained by its single privilege from law, "that they might retain what they could get" and receive voluntary con- tributions of estates which "could never afterwards be 281bid. 2: 301. This notion goes back to antiquity and is expressed in similar terms by Cicero, Of the nature of the Gods, xlii (C. D. Yonge trans.): "What think you of those, who have asserted that the whole doctrine concerning the immortal Gods was the invention of politicians, whose view was to govern that part of the community by religion, which reason could not influ- ence? Are not their opinions subversive of all religion?" 29 Essays on the Characteristics, Essay III, Sec. III, London, 1751.</page><page sequence="68">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 19511 CONTROVERSIAL THEOLOGY 363 converted to other uses." 30 The evil to which Shaftes- bury objects, however, was not so much the sinecures of the priesthood as the errors and superstitions which they originated and perpetuated. In every nation, he declares, "the quantity of superstition . . . will, in pro- portion, nearly answer the number of priests, diviners, soothsayers, prophets, or such who gain their livelihood, or receive advantages by officiating in religious affairs." Shaftesbury's method of combating the influence of priestcraft and superstition in his own culture is to un- dermine confidence in the Scriptures by attacking the doctrine of verbal inspiration in two ways, ridiculing popular Bible stories, a method discussed above, and demonstrating the unreliability of the text. In Sensus Communis he introduces the second method by asserting the propositions that the morals, character, and genius of an author must be considered and his judgment, candor, and disinterestedness approved by the reader before anything is taken on his authority, and that criti- cal truth is a "matter of nice speculation" because of the obstacles encountered in judging and determining what commentators, translators, paraphrasts, grammar- ians have delivered in the midst of such variety of style, such different read- ings, such interpolationsl and corruptions in the originals; such mistakes of copyists, transcribers, editors, and a hun- dred such accidents to which ancient books are subject.Y These propositions are presented in the text as general precepts of literary criticism, but in Shaftesbury's index they are listed under "Scripture, Judgment of." In Miscellaneous Reflections Shaftesbury openly applies these principles to Scripture. He emphasizes first of all the inevitable uncertainty in all aspects of Christian belief. The Christian who has not been given a special revelation, miracle or sign "has no more than a nicely critical historical faith, subject to various speculations, and a thousand different criticisms of languages and literature." 32 The average person exercises an even greater amount of faith than this, for, having no criti- cal knowledge or training, he must place his confidence and trust "in those modern men, or societies of men, to whom the public, or he himself ascribes the judgment of these records, and commits the determination of sacred writ and genuine story." Shaftesbury is trying to convince his readers that they should reason for themselves independently of authority concerning the validity of the Scriptures. He attacks as absurd the notion that any work or treatise written in human lan- guage can be above human criticism, for if the art of writing depends upon grammatical rules of human in- vention formed by casual practice, there can be no scripture but what must of necessity be subject to the reader's narrow scrutiny and strict judg- ment, unless a language and grammar, different from any 30 Robertson, 2: 183-184. 31Ibid 1: 97. 321Ibid. 2: 201- of human structure, were delivered down from heaven and miraculously accommodated to human service and capacity.33 Shaftesbury's opinion of the literary value of the Scrip- tures is revealed in an illustration, intended as analogy, of paintings in certain churches affirmed to be divinely wrought by a supernatural hand. After commenting on the clumsy style and manner of the pretended heavenly workmanship, Shaftesbury remarks "that if the pencil had been heaven-guided it could never have been so lame in its performance." Shaftesbury emphasizes the unreliability of the Scrip- tures by pointing out that the "Divine Author and Founder of our religion" took no part whatsoever in the composition of the New Testament and that the reputed author of the Pentateuch purportedly treated of his own "death, burial and succession."2 34 He ana- lyzes the first four verses of Luke, emphasizing the writing of the narrative some time after the events had occurred, the multiplicity of those who had undertaken reports before Luke's, the sources of his narrative in what was believed among the catechized from tradition and early instruction and Luke's phrase describing his project, "it seemed good to me." LeClerc in 1690 had used these same verses to show that the Scriptures are not inspired concerning historical matters of fact.35 Shaftesbury's major argument against inspiration con- cerns the variations in the text, an argument which is used not only against literal inspiration, but also against dogmas and positive doctrines. Should the record, Shaftesbury declares, instead of being single, short, and uniform, appear to be multifarious, voluminous, and of the most difficult interpre- tation, it would be somewhat hard, if not wholly imprac- ticable in the magistrate to suffer this record to be univer- sally current, and at the same time prevent its being vari- ously apprehended and descanted on by the several differ- ing geniuses and contrary judgments of mankind.38 Even in Shaftesbury's time, discussion of textual varia- tions and evidences of human authorship was not lim- ited to the sceptic or the unorthodox. Judicious divines, as Shaftesbury points out, condemn those fanatics who base their religion on the "obvious form of their vulgar Bible" and who "plead the sufficiency of a reiterate translated text." 3 These rational divines admit stylis- tic deficiencies, recognize that a shepherd wrote like a shepherd, a prince like a prince, and are concerned to prove only the substance and principal facts of the revelation.

AMER. PHIL. SOC. toms were probably adopted, not out of fear of reprisal, but to keep from shocking conventional readers and to win them gradually to his point of view. Shaftesbury's most vigorous attack on the text of the Bible is introduced in the debate between the dig- nified gentleman of some rank and his zealot opponents over free-professing and free-discoursing in religious matters. The gentleman of dignity taunts the zealots with the textual difficulties in the way of their position that the Holy Scripture is an absolute authority and a standard of truth. He asks whether the title Scriptures represented the apocryphal Scripture or the more canonical? The full or the half-authorised ? The doubtful or the certain ? The controverted or uncontroverted? The singly-read or that of various readings? The text of these manuscripts or of those ? The transcripts, copies, titles, catalogues of this Church and nation, or of the other? of this sect and partv or of another ? of those in one age called orthodox, alnd in possession of power, or of those wvho in another over- threw their predecessors' authority, and in their turn also assumed the guardianship and power of holy things? 8 These questions concerning the validity of the Scrip- tures are supported by lengthy paraphrases of passages from Jeremy Taylor's A Discourse of the Liberty of Prophesying and John Tillotson's The Rule of Faith. Although Shaftesbury represents the passages from Taylor as words "publicly and solemnly delivered . . . by one of the episcopal order" and those from Tillotson as "the exact phrase and words of the great author," and, although quotation marks are used, Shaftesbury is not giving an exact rendering of the words of either author. His very loose, selective paraphrase is designed to support his own argument, not to give the meaning of his author, and, particularly in regard to Taylor, Shaftesbury cannot escape the charge of misrepresenta- tion. For example, Taylor begins a section on the diffi- culty of Scripture in unnecessary points with an affirma- tion that all the necessary articles of faith are clearly and plainly set down in Scripture and that no nman can be ignorant of them without his own fault. Then he adds that there are other "innumerable places, contain- ing in them great mysteries, but yet either so inwrapped with a cloud, or so darkened with unbrages . . . that God may seem to have left them as trials of our indus- try . . ." [Sec. III] Shaftesbury, completely ignoring the preamble, repeats all that is said about obscurity and difficulty, leaving the reader with the impression that there is nothing clear in the Scriptures. In his choice of words as well, Shaftesbury makes suggestions that were probably unintended by Taylor. It is un- necessary to devote space to a complete analysis of Shaftesbury's "quotations." One example will be suf- ficient to illustrate his tactics, and the inquiring reader may make further comparisons of his own. Taylor writes: I consider that there are very many senses and designs of expounding Scripture, and when the gram- 38 Ibid. 2: 355. natical sense is found out, we are many times never the nearer; it is not that which was intended; for there is, in verv many Scriptures, a double sense, a literal and a spiritual. Shaftesbury paraphrases: I consider withal, that there have been many designs and views in expounding these writings; many senses in which they are expounded; and when the grammatical sense is found out, we are many times never the nearer. It is surprising that John Brown did not seize upon this somewhat questionable aspect of Shaftesbury's method of argument, but Brown does not even allude to Taylor or Tillotson. He accuses Shaftesbury of unfairness chiefly in establishing two feeble puppet clergymen and assigning them the impossible task of "proving the Necessity of an absolute Uniformity in Opinion." Shaftesbury himself, Brown continues, pretends to prove only that Scripture cannot be a foundation for uniformity of opinion in all things, but "he throws out insinuations to imply that there is no foundation of truth for any thing in Gospel History." Brown dis- misses Shaftesbury's argument concerning human weak- nesses in the canonizing and transmission of the text as dragging us into "the beaten Track of Controversy" and asserts that his stale objections are fully refuted by a number of authors including DuPin, LeClerc, Tille- mont, Whitby, Lardner, Phileleutherus Lipsiensis, and Jortin. Brown accuses Shaftesbury of unfairness also in implying that confusion of churches and sects means that each has a different Bible and in implying that the primitive fathers "guarded" the sacred records, that is, kept them from inspection and criticism. All sects ap- peal to one common Scripture, Brown replies, and none of the fathers had a view to temporal adivantage, for all firmly believed in immortality and in the truth of their religion. One of the passages in A Letter concerning Enthusi- asmt on which, Shaftesbury himself tells us, an "ill con- struction" was placed is part of a section urging reli- gious toleration in which the emperor Julian, known as "the Apostate," is described as a noble example of tolerance and as a "great restrainer of persecution," even of those "who branded the state religion, and made a merit of affronting the public worship." 40 The "ill construction" is probably that of Mary Astell, who in her Enquiry after Wit (pp. 158-159) cites Julian's denial of education to Christian children by confiscat- ing church land-s and schools, his taxing and excluding from office non-conformists to the state religion, his im- prisoning Christians merely for singing psalms, his tor- turing and executing others, and his scoffing at both God and man. In Miscellaneous Reflections, Shaftes- bury defends his original favorable construction of the Emperor's conduct by relatinog the theme of Julian to the conduct of contemporary divinies as well as to the 39 Essays, Essay III, Sec. III. 40 Robertson, 1: 19.</page><page sequence="70">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 1951] CONTROVERSIAL THEOLOGY 365 broader issue of toleration in general. He remarks that his praise of Julian was no more indeed than had been said of that virtuous and gallant emperor by his greatest enemies; even by those who (to the shame of Christianity) boasted of his having been most insolently affronted on all occasions, and even treacherously assassinated by one of his Christian soldiers. As for such authors as these, should I cite them in their proper invective style and saint-like phrase, they would make no very agreeable appearance.41 Here Shaftesbury is perhaps referring to a famous book by the Whig divine Samuel Johnson, Julian the Apos- tate: Being a Short Account of His Life (London, 1682), a book which, according to one of its critics, made a greater noise in the city of London at its first publication than did the apostacy of Julian the Emperor in the cities of the Roman Empire.42 Since Johnson's book attacks Popery and the Duke of York under the gpise of paganism and Julian, it is strange that Shaftes- bury should attack it, for its political principles are in accord with his own. Yet Shaftesbury's description quoted above fits it perfectly. Johnson gives in great detail and with obvious relish instances of the Chris- tians' hatred and contempt of Julian, "How they re- proached him and his Religion to his very Beard; beat his Priests before his Face, and had done him too, if he had not got out of the way; prayed for his Confusion, and triumphed at his Death, and loaded his Memory with the greatest Disgrace and Infamy." 4 He spends a whole chapter reviewing the legends concerning Jul- ian's death, suggests that the most likely explanation is that he was killed by one of his own Christian soldiers, and quotes an ancient authority justifying "such a Traiterous Assassination." 4 Also in pursuing his at- tack on the doctrine of passive obedience, he admits that "Julian's Persecution was but a flea-biting to what the Christians had formerly felt." 45 Regarding the invectives of Christian divines as un- fit for quotation, Shaftesbury quotes instead Julian's epistle to the Bostrens as "a pattern of his humor and genius, as well as of his principle and sentiments." In this letter, the emperor grants the Christians right to assemble and worship as they please in their own con- gregations, but warns them against sedition and discord. He exhorts the Bostrens to live in peace, to remember that men are informed of truth by discourse and reason, not by blows and violence, and to refrain from injuring or molesting the Galilean people. The impression is left that Julian was a wise and kindly ruler governed by a virtuous and exalted mind. Some critics have 41Ibid. 2: 210-211. 42 [George Hickes] Jovian, or, an Aniswer to Julian the Apos- tate, 1, London, 1683. Other books on the controversy are The Account of the Life of Julian the Apostate vindicated, London, 1682, and The life of Boetiuis, Recoinmiended to the author of the Life of Julian, London, 1683. 43 Op. cit., 20-21. 44 Ibid., 38. 45 Ibid., 40. objected that this is a false impression created by de- liberate misrepresentation.46 They assert that by en- tirely omitting the command concerning Bishop Titus, Shaftesbury presents Julian in a less odious light than he deserves. It is true that Shaftesbury omits the words referring to the Bishop, "Therefore, of your own free will, seize your accuser and expel him from the city," 47 but this by no means counteracts the spirit of tolerance in the rest of the letter and is hardly enough to substan- tiate a charge of duplicity or falsification. Shaftesbury's divine-baiting activities and his carping at the text, miracles and fabulous stories of Scripture may perhaps be dismissed as buffoonery or captiousness, but his indictment of the moral nominalists or nominal moralists among the clergy is pressed with sincerity and conviction. In The Moralists he observes that the gen- erality of religious writers in opposing the atheists write on contrary principles so as to confute themselves. "Some of them hold zealously for virtue, and are real- ists in the point. Others, one may say, are only nominal moralists, by making virtue nothing in itself, a creature of will only, or a mere name of fashion." 48 The real- ists in morality, among whom Shaftesbury counted him- self, follow the principles of Cudworth, who maintained that moral good and evil, honest and dishonest, are not mere names, but have an independent real authority, that virtue "is really something in itself, . . . not con- stituted from without, or dependent on custom, fancy, or will; not even on the Supreme Will itself." The contrary opinion held, according to Cudworth, not only by the ancient Epicureans and Hobbes but also by "divers modern theologers" assumes that "there is nothing absolutely, intrinsically and naturally good, and evil, just and unjust, antecedently to any positive com- mand or prohibition of God; but that the arbitrary will and pleasure of God, (that is, an omnipotent Being devoid of all essential and natural justice) by its com- mands and prohibitions, is the first and only rule and measure thereof." 49 The philosopher Locke was one who held the will of God theory,50 and Cumberland, another of the chief opponents of Hobbes, also opposed the notion of the independent authority of good, not by resting good and evil upon the will of God, but upon the needs and' circumstances of society.51 For this, he was reproved by his translator, John Maxwell, who quotes at length from the Clharacteristics on the real authority of good and evil.52 Shaftesbury's initial attack on the will of God theory appears in A4n Inquiry, and the distinction between real- 46 Siegm.

SOC. ists and nominalists in virtue is used in The Moralists as the central issue in the defense of the earlier treatise. In Sensus Communis Shaftesbury shows the resem- blance between the will of God theory and political authoritarianism. Those who live under a tyranny and admire its power as sacred, he asserts, "are debauched as much in their religion, as in their morals." . . . They have scarce a notion of what is good or just, other than as mere will and power, have determined. Om- nipotence, they think, would hardly be itself, were it not at liberty to dispense with the laws of equity, and change at pleasure the standard of moral rectitude.53 In Advice to An Author Shaftesbury asserts that moral rectitude, the discernment of what is sound and just in the affections, is the sole measure and standard by which religion is judged, spirits searched, prophecies proved and miracles distinguished. "To bid me judge author- ity by morals, whilst the rule of morals is supposed dependent on mere authority and will, is the same in reality as to bid me see with my eyes shut, measure without a standard, and count without arithmetic." 54 After Shaftesbury, the controversy developed into one of the most widely-discussed, moral and theological issues of the century. Samuel Clarke and his followers held that the eternal immutable nature and necessary relation of things existed independently; prior to crea- tion or the will of God. Law and William Warburton insisted that they depend on the will of God. Scores of works were written on a subsidiary issue-whether moral virtue consists in complying with the positive in- stitutions of God or in complying with moral obligation. It was generally held that moral duties are founded in the eternal and immutable reasons of things and are always obligatory, antecedent to command; whereas the positive duties are founded only on prudential reasons and are not binding until enforced by a lawgiver. Logi- cally, the upholders of the will of God theory would argue the supremacy of positive duties, and the asserters of independent moral distinctions would defend moral -duties. Shaftesbury closely associated the will of God theory and the doctrine of future rewards and punishments as aspects of moral nominalism. We have already dis- cussed the background of the latter subject and Shaftes- bury's treatment of it in An Inquiry, but there are pas- sages in other treatises which reflect more directly upon the clergy and should be mentioned here. In Soliloquy Shaftesbury finds moral materialism even in "the sacred volumes," referring to the description of heaven in terms of a material city of gold and precious stones; he points out that "the best doctrine could not go down without a treat" and asserts that the disciples "were apt to construe every divine saying in a belly-sense." 6"5 In The Moralists Shaftesburv sarcastically mocks the re- 53Robertson, 1: 53. 54Ibid. 1: 193. 55Ibid. 1: 183-184. ligious authors and sacred orators who, propounding the doctrine of future rewards, strike at moral virtue as a rival to religion. Morality must not be named; Nature has no pretence; rea- son is an enemy; common justice, folly; and virtue, misery. Who would not be vicious had he his choice? Who would forbear but because he must? Or who would value virtue but for hereafter? 56 In a parallel passage in Miscellaneous Reflections, Shaftesbury represents modern libertines and certain divines as expressing a common philosophy: Happy life, that of the indulged passions, might we pursue it Miserable condition; miserable life, that of reason and vir- tue which we are bid pursue.57 A few pages before this Shaftesbury applies the term "short-thinkers," a retaliatory word of his own coinage to carry all the odium of "free-thinkers," to the selfish computers of happiness and private good, whose pur- suits of interest are attended with a steady vein of cun- ning and low thought, sordid deliberations and false rel- ishes of life. If these grave, circumspect and interested gentlemen, Shaftesbury declares, have, for their soul's sake and through a careful provision for hereafter, engaged in certain speculations of religion, their taste of virtue and relish of life is not the more im- proved on this account. The thoughts they have on these new subjects of divinity are so biassed and perplexed by those half-thoughts and raw imaginations of interest and worldly affairs, that they are still disabled in the rational pursuit of happiness and good.58 In A Letter concerning Enthusiasm Shaftesbury in- cludes even Locke and Tillotson among the moral ma- terialists because of their doctrine that we should strive to have faith in God out of mere prudence, for "if, after all, there be nothing in the matter, there will be no harm in being thus deceived; but if there be anything, it will be fatal for them not to have believed to the full." 59 This doctrine Shaftesbury condemns as a beg- garly refuge which will work contrary to its own pur- pose and actually prevent us from believing either to our happiness in this world or to our advantage in another. Our reason will refuse to sanction the cheat, our religion will deteriorate and our opinion of a Su- preme Deity will become worse "while our belief is founded on so injurious a thought of him." In answer to this condemnation of a hitherto reputa- ble doctrine, one of Shaftesbury's early critics, John Leng, asserts that Shaftesbury uses the same reasoning himself in considering the advantages to virtue of a belief in a deity.f0?

His method of combining parable and irony renders his meaning somewhat ambiguous, but he seems to be ac- cusing the clergy of attempting to match their belief with their interest and declaring them to be successful in the attempt. He tells a fable of three merry gentle- men, traveling in a dismal and desolate country, who to make the journey as agreeable as possible adopted the expedient of praising lavishly whatever they could find of the slightest merit. They eulogized ordinary prospects and indifferent fare so effusively that it was "apparent they had wrought upon themselves to be- lieve that they were tolerably well served." 62 Shaftes- bury denies that he intends by this story "to represent it as an easy matter for people to persuade themselves into what opinion or belief they pleased," but this inter- pretation is hardly much different from the one he does admit: that where fit circumstances concur, and many inviting oc- casions offer from the side of men's interest, their humour, or their passion, 'tis no extraordinary case to see them enter into such a plot as this against their own understandings, and endeavour by all possible means to persuade both them- selves and, others of what they think convenient and useful to believe.63 Probably expecting the reader to apply this to the clergy, Shaftesbury adds that men find it easy to ac- cept the received or authorized opinion-they are anx- ious enough to believe any flattering imposture, and disbelief forces them either to live as hypocrites or be esteemed profane-but he does not advocate a facile acceptance. The alternative he leaves inexpressed, tac- itly appealing to the reader's sense of integrity. He shows the influence of prudent credulousness in reli- gion by instancing the preposterous and contrary faiths and opinions raised on the foundation of miracles and pretended commissions from heaven, and remarking that they "have been as generally espoused and pas- sionately cherished as the greatest truths and most cer- tain revelations." The succeeding discussion shows that Shaftesbury is no more a friend to the influence of prescription, precedent, and authority as sanctions 61 Robertson, 2: 76. 62 Ibid. 2: 217. 63 Ibid. 2: 219. of religious faith than he is to the Spanish Inquisition. In countries where faith has "gone by inheritance, and opinions are entailed by law," he says, the vulgar have almost no choice in belief, but in countries where belief is imposed by "particular courts . . ., peculiar meth- ods of justice, peculiar magistrates and officers, proper inquests and certain wholesome severities," then abso- lute conformity and uniformity are certain to be at- tained. If truth is propagated in this way, he con- tinues, "the very nature of such means can . . . allow but little honor to the propagators, and little merit to the disciples and believers," for untruth may be as ef- fectually supported, upon this foundation as truth. The real purpose of the parable and the discussion of reli- gious authoritarianism is revealed in the principle, which Shaftesbury intends to be applied to his own country and time, that "there can be no rational be- lief but where comparison is allowed, examination per- mitted, and a sincere toleration established." To Shaftesbury, the concept of an established belief goes no further than a declaration that a certain faith is accepted as true by the civil authority. "Whatever be- lief is once espoused or countenanced by the magis- trate," he asserts, "will have a sufficient advantage, without any help from force or menaces on one hand, or extraordinary favour and partial treatment on the other." With this interpretation the parable is made to serve as a plea for a "tolerating, mild, and gentle government" as well as a rebuke to the interested credu- lousness of clergymen. All of the references to religion and the magistrate in the Characteristics require interpretation because of irony, indirectness or other ambiguities, and it is difficult to state precisely what Shaftesbury's attitude was toward the religious establishment. What may well be the most reliable statement is found in "The Philo- sophical Regimen," a compilation of rough notes, un- adorned and unequivocal, which probably represent Shaftesbury's personal opinions. Here he asserts that it is best not to disturb the vulgar in their established ceremonies and opinions concerning religion, for to do so would "lead them into greater error and render them profane and impious."",4 To impugn the received opinions without providing a better means for applying inherent ideas of God and justice is to foster impiety and atheism. Modern superstitions, no matter how bad, are better than pagan. Remember, therefore, Shaftes- bury counsels himself, "to respect these rites, whatever they be, which others have within their own minds erected to the Deity, as well as those other rites which they have publicly erected and in other outward tem- ples." Although the Characteristics seems from the orthodox point of view to be a result of going contrary to this advice, Shaftesbury having been frequently ac- cused of promoting impiety and atheism, the above passage-itself an example of tolerance-is in general consistent with the Characteristics. Shaftesburv un- 64 Rand, Life, 29.</page><page sequence="73">368 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. doubtedly impugns some aspects of orthodox belief, but his main emphasis is on moral order and beauty, divine goodness and pure theism. He observed the external forms of public worship as part of his obliga- tion toward the vulgar who are in need of a public leading, and wrote the Characteristics for those who could at the same time recognize the absurdities of orthodoxy and respond to rhapsodic portrayals of the moral beauty of the universe. The doctrine of Shaftesbury which has seemed most dangerous to religious leaders is that concerning the province of ridicule in forensic discussion. Through- out the entire eighteenth century this subject was given more attention by opponents and proponents alike than any other part of the Characteristics. According to most of these critics, Shaftesbury taught that ridicule is the test of truth, even though the phrase itself does not appear in his work. According to others more closely in touch with the spirit of his work, he merely advocated that the use of ridicule be extended to include religious subjects. The difficulty of getting at Shaftes- bury's real meaning is primarily responsible for the misconceptions concerning his position on ridicule. His flippant, bantering tone, conforming to his own prin- ciple of good humor in forensics, together with his free and easy style, purposely lively and light to mock the ponderous pedants, succeeds admirably in conveying his personality and attitude, but on the other hand forces the reader to guess at his meaning rather than allowing him to grasp it. Also, it is difficult to tell at times whether Shaftesbury is speaking earnestly or ironically, with his fist in the air or his tongue in his cheek. As John Brown says in protesting against Shaftesbury's argumentative ambiguity, "the formalist is under a dou- ble difficulty; not only to conquer his enemy, but to find him." His vocabulary constitutes one of the pri- mary difficulties encountered, for we are uncertain some- times whether he is talking about ridicule at all. We are not sure whether "raillery," "freedom of wit and humour," "mirth," "Ccheerfulness," and similar terms used by Shaftesbury are regarded as synonymous with ridicule or as possessing other meanings. This "shift- ing and mixing" of terms is well described by Brown, himself not averse to employing the device, who charges that Shaftesbury confounds mirth, urbanity, or good humor with raillery or ridicule. Shaftesbury's Letter concerning Enthusiasm begins with words of commendation of the age for its whole- hearted ridicule of private folly coupled with words of regret that it is not so tolerant of being told of public faults. This leads to the underlying principle of the letter, the advocacy of liberty of opinion and freedom of public discussion. In spirit, if not in power, the first two essays of the Characteristics should be ranked with Milton's Areopagitica and John Stuart Mill's Liberty, all works in which intellectual liberty or freedom of discussion is held as the only approach to truth and its most valid test. Thus, Shaftesbury argues that there can never be impartial censure of manners when any segment of society is exempted from criticism. Ridi- cule should neither be feared nor opposed, for experi- ence and reason constitute the only criteria of what may or may not be exposed to ridicule. If men reason ill, " 'tis reason still must teach them to do better." Thus, even if ridicule be ill-placed at first, it will "certainly fall at last where it deserves," for ridicule cannot possibly prevail against reason. "How comes it to pass, then, that we appear such cowards in reasoning, and are so afraid to stand the test of ridicule ?" This question does not imply that ridicule is the test of truth or reasonilng, but the reverse, that reason is the test of ridicule! No subject should be exempt from ridicule because it is deemed too grave, for "gravity is of the very essence of imposture." Indeed, ridicule must be called into play to determine whether the gravity itself is properly placed. The test of ridicule is thus not the test of the truth of opinions, but of the gravity or seriousness in which we hold them. In Sensus communis appears a passage which comes closer to the theory of ridicule as a test of truth. Truth, 'tis supposed, may bear all lights; and one of those principal lights, or natural mediums by which things are to be viewed, in order to a thorough recognition, is ridicule itself, or that manner of proof by which we discern what- ever is liable to just raillery in any subject.65 Here again, however, it is the demeanor rather than the opinion which is at issue. Ridicule decides whether a doctrine deserves a sober hearing rather than whether the doctrine is true. Thus Shaftesbury is attempting to distinguish between pompousness, pedantry, preciosity and legitimate seriousness, offering raillery as the test of attitude or disposition in the discourse of opinions. This leads him to assert that "without wit and humour, reason can hardly have its proof or be distinguished." 66 Considered in its context this means that wit and good humor are prerequisite to free debate, and it is the free debate which is the test of truth, not the good humor. The latter merely overwhelms the magisterial voice and high strain of the pedagogue, which are used "to keep understanding at a distance and out of reach," and by exposing imposture and false gravity clears the way for freedom of discussion. It is to illustrate this unveiling of imposture that Shaftesbury quotes the saying of an ancient sage "that humour was the only test of gravity; and gravity of humour." 67 Much of the hubbub against Shaftesbury's views on ridicule was probably caused by his justifying its use in religious matters. Yet this was nothing new; Dry- den, for example, had asserted that a "satirical poet is the check of the laymen on bad priests." 68 Further- more, Shaftesbury nowhere even implies that religion 65 Robertson, 1: 44. 66 Ibid. 1: 52. 67 Ibid. 1: 52. 68 Preface to the Fables, Essays of Joh1n Dryden, ed. W. P. Ker, 2: 260, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1926.</page><page sequence="74">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 1951] CONTROVERSIAL THEOLOGY 369 should be a particular target although the position of the essay on wit and humor immediately following that on enthusiasm may seem to direct his remarks toward religion. Actually, he is advocating raillery as a weapon against evil where serious moralizing has failed. Con- gratulating "the solemn reprovers of vice" on the suc- cess which they may have enjoyed, he asks "in the meanwhile, why others may not be allowed to ridicule folly, and recommend wisdom and virtue (if possibly they can) in a way of pleasantry and mirth." 69 Throughout the entire essay Shaftesbury is pleading for the freedom of wit and humor in all social rela- tionships, not merely ridicule alone, and certainly not ridicule of religion in particular. The latter is quite subsidiary to his advocacy of making intellectual inter- course, polite, friendly, and easy. Thus, he makes sev- eral restrictions on the use of raillery, explaining that liberty should not become public license. The ethics of public discussion permits much less freedom than may be shown in private discourse among "gentlemen and friends who know one another perfectly well." Subjects which are beyond the grasp of the public or which give offense should not be treated in public; neither should the public be forced to hear what it dislikes, nor should it be laughed at to its face. "What is contrary to good breeding is in this respect as con- trary to liberty." The liberty which Shaftesbury is advocating, he is careful to explain, is only "the liberty of the club, and of that sort of freedom which is taken amongst gentlemen and friends who know one another perfectly well." Thus he tells us later in the essay, "there is a great difference between seeking how to raise a laugh from everything and seeking in everything what justly may be laughed at. For nothing is ridiculous ex- cept what is deformed; nor is anything proof against raillery except what is handsome and just." 7" Far from advocating its unrestrained use, Shaftes- bury admits that satire or ridicule may be misapplied, misguided, or misdirected. "In the same manner as a malicious censure, craftily worded and pronounced' with assurance, is apt to pass with mankind for shrewd wit," he says, "so a virulent maxim in bold expressions though without any justness of thought, is readily re- ceived for true philosophy." The history of the use of ridicule, together with the excesses to which it had risen in his own age startled Shaftesbury a little and put him "in doubt what to think of the practice." 71 By stating that the papists had failed to silence the reform- ing spirit of the protestant martyrs because they pre- ferred the shedding of blood to a merrier way, Shaftes- bury even implies that the weapon of raillery may be successfully brought to bear against a desirable or use- ful reform.2 69 Robertson, 1: 89. 70Ibid. 1: 85. 71Ibid. 1: 44. 721bid. 1 : 22. An important point to remember is that Shaftesbur3 is not urging that ridicule be brought to bear againsi religion or anything else, but merely that there be free- dom to use it. Restraint, persecution, and spiritual tyr- anny, he says, lead to undesirable extremes of raillery buffoonery, and burlesque, and he is advocating fre( thought and expression as a means of avoiding these extremes. The ancients treated grave subjects in a fre( and familiar style, and for this reason they reflect littl of the "egregious way of raillery and ridicule" and "there is hardly such a thing found as mere burlesqu in any authors of the polite ages." The chief defense of Shaftesbury's position, a salieni which most of his opponents attempted to weaken, is hiE contention that it is impossible to use ridicule against virtue, to laugh at honesty, bravery, or generosity. "A man must be soundly ridiculous," he says, "who with all the wit imaginable, would go about to ridicule wis- dom, or laugh at honesty, or good manners." 3 This is probably the most vulnerable spot in Shaftesbury's armor, for experience seems to show that virtue may be ridiculed and honesty, laughed at. It is strange, therefore, that Brown and other opponents of Shaftes- bury did not concentrate their attacks on this point in- stead of on others less vulnerable. Shaftesbury's concluding remarks to Sensus corn- munis epitomize his main purpose in writing the essay, to foster a pleasant, easy and becoming method of mor- alizing and discussing. In reviewing the essay he says, J have taken the liberty, you see, to laugh upon some occa- sions; and if I have either laughed wrong, or been imperti- nently serious, I can be content to be laughed at in my turn. If contrariwise I am railed at, I can laugh still, as before, and with fresh advantage to my cause. Although the phrase, "ridicule, the test of truth" does not appear in the Characteristics, there is a phrase very much like it in the index. After the heading, "Truth bears all lights" in the index of the 1711 edi- tion, which we may assume Shaftesbury himself com- piled, appears the phrase, "Ridicule, a Light, or Crite- rion to Truth," but even this phrase is not equivalent to the doctrine, "ridicule is the test of truth," which most of his enemies fathered upon him.74 This brings us again to the question, which never has been satisfactorily answered, whether Shaftesbury should or should not be classed among the deists. Leland so classed him and was forced, in response to many protests, to write a vindication of his decision. On one side may be considered the similarity of much of Shaftesbury's thought to the latitudinarian position although the resemblance here is predominantly politi- cal. On the other side should be considered his flippant attitude toward the Scriptures and his antagonism to- ward the clergy. Whether Shaftesbury should be 73Ibid. 1: 86. 74 For a detailed discussion of this subject, see A. 0. Aldridge, Shaftesbury and the test of truth, Publ. Mod. Lang.

Shaftesbury is a deist if the word means recognizing the abuses of religious, organizations, ex- posing the evils of bigotry and superstition, and oppos- ing the literal interpretation of Scripture through the use of higher criticism. Shaftesbury is not a deist if deism is incompatible with strong faith in a just and benevolent ruling providence and with a willingness to conform to the practices of public worship both for per- sonal spiritual satisfaction and for the sake of a salutary influence upon the community. Perhaps Diderot is right in insisting that it is unjust to count Shaftesbury "au nombre des Asgil, des Tindale et des Tolatnd, gens aussi decries dans leur ]2glise en qualite de chretiens, que dans la republique des lettres en qualite d'au- teurs." Perhaps the best solution is to drop the word deist completely, to use in its place theist, and to take Shaftesbury at his word when he asserts his theistic belief and his conviction "that to be a settled Christian, it is necessary to be first of all a good theist." 76 75 ?Euvres 1: 16, Paris, 1821. 7 Robertson, 2: 19.</page><page sequence="76">BIBLIOGRAPHY I.

Nearly two-thirds of the references concern Shaftesbury's theories of ridicule; others concern his views on a future state, friendship, motives to virtue, and esthetic principles. Some are devoted to his style, but none are biographical. The continuation of interest in Shaftesbury throughout the century was due in great measure to the publication in 1725 of Hutcheson's Inquiry and in 1751 of Brown's Essays. Extreme divergences of opinion are revealed. Some authors call Shaftesbury an atheist, and others, a foe of atheism. Of special interest are the sermons devoted exclusively to Shaftesburian doctrines and the evidence of Shaftes- bury's influence in America as early as 1730. An attempt has been made to place all references under date of composition or first publication.

Most authorities ascribe the later Reflections upon a Letter con- cerning Enthusiasm, 1709, to Fowler, but I think they are wrong. In A Letter concerning Enthusiasm, Shaftesbury ridicules a "Christian prelate" [i.e. Fowler] for believing in spirits and fairies. The author of the Remarks devotes his introductory pages to the prelate and his fairies, and asserts, p. 64, that he could give well-attested accounts of evil spirits in his own country, "had I a mind to be Ridicul'd by him, as his Eminent, Learned, and truly Christian Prelate was." Probably the prelate himself is writing this. The author of the Reflections, on the other hand, does not seem interested in the prelate and his fairies. In the main, the Remarks defends Christianity against the alleged attack in A Letter concerning Enthusiasm. SWIFT, JONATHAN. Letter to Ambrose Philips, September 14, 1708. See F. E.

See pp. 429-433 for a review of Bartholomew Fair: Or an Enquiry after Wit. "The Letter concerning Enthusiasm, has been abroad in the World for a considerable time, and is doubtless a very pernicious and destructive Piece, aiming in the general to turn every thing that is Sacred and Serious into Banter and Ridicule; and to instil into the looser and less thinking Part of the World, such Ideas of God and his Attributes, as will settle him nearly upon the Level, with the Epicurean Deity, and unhinge all the serimniIQ and soenhr Mntives, to thlie Rp1f and Practierp of R pi;ioii" 371</page><page sequence="77">372 ALDRIDGE: SHAFTESBURY AND DEISM [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. [JENKINS, ROBERT] Remarks on some Books lately Publish'd. 1709. I have not seen a copy of this work, but according to John Edwards, Some New Discoveries of the Uncertainty, Deficiency, and Corruptions of Human Knowledge and Learning (1714) the author discusses the writer of A Letter concerning Enthusiasm in the Preface. "He uses such harsh Terms as these, concerning him and his Undertaking, execrable Design, malicious and ignorant Falshood, false and wicked Insinuations, little Efforts of Wit and Malice, he acts a Popish part, he fights against God, he hath little regard to good Sense, he promotes Deism and Atheism, his Book is Crepitus Satanae." [TINDAL, MATTHEW.] A Letter to the Reverend Dr. Moss, In Behalf of The Rights of the Christian Church. Together with A Poetick Rhapsody. By A Young Oxford-Scholar. 1709. The "Poetick Rhapsody" is an imitation of the style of "the late Philosophical Rhapsody [The Moralists]." When I pass thro the Fields, and see the Sheep Feeding upon the tender verdant Grass, And hear 'em calling to their wanton Lambs; I cannot chuse but envy them a Life, So free from anxious Care and fretting Pain. This is the first of many suggestions that the style of The Moralists resembles blank verse. HOADLY, BENJAMIN.

Hoadly and Shaftesbury agree on most matters, but on pp. 229-230 Hoadly objects to Shaftesbury's theory of ridicule. 1710 [SWIFT, JONATHAN.] A Tale of a Tub. The Fifth Edition. 1710. See "An Apology" for Swift's disclaimer of having written the Letter concerning Enthusiasm, H. Davis ed., Prose Works, 1: 3. "Several have . . . pronounced another Book to have been the Work of the same Hand with this, which the Author directly affirms to be a thorough mistake; he having yet never so much as read that discourse." This shows more zeal than candor. The previously-cited letter to Hunter implies more than a passing knowledge of the work. BIBLIOTHAQUE CHOISIE. 1710. Periodical.

Needler was probably the first poet whose work was influenced by Shaftesbury's thought. He discusses Shaftesbury in a letter dated December 20, 1711, and imitates him in poems written soon after.

Jack and Tom, two free-thinkers, reflecting Shaftesbury's view of panic and the use of ridicule, get Sir Plyant drunk to convince him of their doctrine and then cheat him of his estate. The ironical presentation of principles of free-thinking in dialogue form is an anticipation of Berkeley's Alciphron. See p. 17 for reference to "Letter of Enthusiasm, against which this Poem is chiefly levell'd, and was compos'd (tho' till now neglected to be Publish'd) immediately upon the coming out of that Pamphlet."

W. VON. Remarques Sur . . . Lettre sur l'En- thousiasme. See [Des Maizeaux ed.,] Recueil de Diverses Pieces . . . 2nd Edition, 2: 311-334, Amsterdam, 1740. This is a page-by-page commentary, written before Leibniz knew the identity of the author. "Je ne vois pas aussi que le ris, c'est-a-dire, quelque chose qui tient du m6pris &amp; abbaisse l'idee de l'objet, soit une pierre de touche qui serve i reconnoitre la verite." This may have been written as early as 1709 or as late as the following item, which Leibniz sent to Shaftesbury in 1712. LEIBNIZ, G. W. VON. Jugement sur les CEuvres de Mr. le Comte de Shaftsbury. 1712. See [Des Maizeaux ed.,] Recueil 2: 335-353, 1740. This is, on the whole, extremely favorable criticism of the entire Char- acteristics. Leibniz agrees with Shaftesbury that Christianity does not recommend private friendship and subscribes to the praise accorded to Emperor Julian. He is particularly impressed with The Moralists. "Le tour du Discours, la Lettre, le Dialogue, le Platonisme nouveau, la mani6re d'argumenter par interroga- tions; mais sur-tout, la grandeur de la beaut6 des id6es, l'En- thousiasme lumineux, la Divinite apostroph6e, me ravissoient &amp; me mettoient en extase....

He finds that Shaftesbury "s'&amp;etoit merveilleusement corrige dans le progres de ses meditations, et que d'un Lucien il &amp;toit devenu un Platon. . . .Ainsi je lui parlai tout d'un autre ton, en faisant des re- flexions sur les Caracteres." 1716 THE OCCASIONAL PAPER. 1716.

The Publishers of this Miscellany have the Pleasure to entertain their Country, and particularly this good Town, with a variety of Poems, that had either never been compos'd, or never seen the Light without it." Among the contributors were Arbuckle, Thomson, and David Mallet. Their later deism is by this preface directly linked to Shaftesbury. Its importance cannot be over- emphasized. 1723 MANDEVILLE, BERNARD. Fable of the Bees. 2nd ed., 1723.

In this edition of the life, Shaftesbury's criticism of Locke in his letters is presented (1: vii-viii) in lengthy extracts. In later editions, beginning with the ninth, the criticisms are condensed and termed "too gross and groundless to be here inserted." Shaftesbury's inconsistencies are attributed to his changing from a sober, serious Christian to "a sneering infidel with regard to revealed religion, and a rank enthusiast in morals." See ninth edition, 1: xxiv, 1794. BROWN, JOHN. Essays on the Characteristics. 1751. This is the most extensive eighteenth-century criticism of Shaftesbury, but it did not satisfy Warburton, who had suggested the project to Brown.

This is the standard eighteenth-century work on the subject. See Letter V for an attack on Shaftesbury.

See Letter XXIV, "From Anthony Ashley Cowper to Richard Brewster. On Candour in Religious Disquisitions, and on the Necessity of A Reveal'd Religion." This is a defense of Shaftes- bury against the over-zealous attacks of "Richard Brewster," which name may be a substitution for John Brown. I do not know of any Richard Brewster in eighteenth-century contro- versy, and the person addressed is obviously a clergyman, the description of whom fits Brown.

Many critics have expressed surprise that Bolingbroke, who obviously knew and drew upon the work of Shaftesbury, fails to mention him in his writings. Actually Shaftesbury is men- tioned by name several times in The Craftsman and by innuendo in Bolingbroke's philosophical works. See the comment of Ralph Heathcote, A Sketch of Lord Bolingbroke's Philosophy, p. 5, 1760: ". . . he calls Collins an Atheist; and of Lord Shaftsbury, and his Followers, who teach a Moral Sense to be the sole ground of Moral Obligation, he says, that they bid fair to be Enthusiasts in Ethics, and to make Natural Religion as ridiculous, as some of their brothers have made Revealed, by insisting on the doctrine of an inward light."

GRAY, THOMAS. Letter to Stonhewer, August 18, 1758. The Poems of Mr. Gray to Which are Prefixed Memoirs of His Life and Writings by W. Mason, M. A., York, 1775. This letter explaining how Lord Shaftesbury came to be a popular philosopher was quoted by Johnson in his Life of Gray and has since become well known. 1759 GERARD, ALEXANDER. Essay on Taste. 1759. See p. 201 for remarks on the relation between taste and virtue. SMITH, ADAM. The Theory of Moral Sentiments. 1759. Following Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, Smith recognizes "moral faculties" which reign over the other senses and tell us what is "fit, and right, and proper to be done." TRINIUS, JOHANN ANTON.

LLOYD'S EVENING POST. 1760. Periodical. See October 27-29, for a letter concerning attacks on Foote's The Minor (attacks which compare the play to Aristophanes' ridicule of Socrates) and concerning Foote's defence of Aristo- phanes. The letter has extended extracts from Brown's essay on ridicule. 1762 FIELDING, HENRY. A Fragment of A Comment on Lord Boling- broke's Essays. 1762. Fielding admits that Shaftesbury's method of ridicule may be abused, but proposes nevertheless to use ridicule in commenting on Bolingbroke's essays. WEBB, DANIEL.

Essais sur les Beaux-Arts. 1763. I have not seen a copy of this work in the original Italian. Algarotti is the only eighteenth-century Italian I know of who read any of Shaftesbury's works. Algarotti merely cites an anonymous edition of Shaftesbury's Judgment of Hercules (ceuvres 2: 204, 242, 1772), and although he had read Webb, he was apparently not familiar with the Characteristics. 1764 HURD, RICHARD. Dialogues on the Uses of Foreign Travel. Between Lord Shaftesbury and Mr. Locke. 1764. See Works 4: 88-229, 1811. These are imaginary conversa- tions in which Hurd recreates the styles of the two philosophers as they debate the values of foreign travel. Their philosophical schemes are suggested in Shaftesbury's affirmative and Locke's negative arguments. 1765 MOSHEIM, JOHANN LORENZ. Sitten-Lehre den Heiligen Schrift. 1765. See 7: 9-24 for a discussion of the Characteristics based on Balguy. See 7: 502-504 for a discussion of Shaftesbury's remarks on friendship. 1766 [OSWALD, JAMES.] An Appeal to Common Sense in Behalf of Religion. Edinburgh, 1766. This work is devoted to a defense of Hume, who is called a believer of the great truths of religion, and contains many references to Shaftesbury. See 1: 156. "From the theological writings, and even from the sermons of many divines . . . it would appear that they considered mankind as mere intelligences, . . .till Lord Shaftesbury first, and afterwards Mr. Hutcheson, pointed out other handles by which mankind may be managed."</page><page sequence="86">VOL. 41, PT. 2, 1951] BIBLIOGRAPHY 381 1767 Adventures of an Author.

[NIHELL, LAURENCE.] Rational Self-Love; or A Philosophical and Moral Essay on the Natural Principles of Happiness and Virtue. Limerick, 1770. The thought of this work, which is both anti-Shaftesbury and anti-Mandeville, is based on John Brown's second and third essays, which are highly praised. EUSEBIUS [TURNER, WILLIAM?] Christianity Standing the Test of Ridicule. In The Theological Repository. 1770. Periodical, edited by Joseph Priestley. See 2: 416-440. The author declares that, contrary to Shaftes- bury's insinuations, Christianity has' been subjected to ridicule and has successfully withstood the test. 1773 BURNETT, JAMES, LORD MONBODDO. Of the Origin and Progress of Language. 1773-1776. 2nd ed. 1786. Monboddo was a constant admirer of James Harris.

A Theological Survey of the Human Understanding. Intended as an Antidote Against Modern Deism. Salisbury, 1776. Since this work solicits the patronage of James Harris, Shaftes- bury's nephew, it is not surprising that Shaftesbury is not con- sidered a deist. On p. 129 Shaftesbury is quoted in support of the view that internal or subjective conviction is valid evidence of the existence of God. THIRTEEN CLUB. Liturgy on the Universal Principles of Religion and Morality. 1776. See a contemporary account of this liturgy in David Williams, "More Light on Franklin's Religious Ideas," American Historical Review 43, 1938. See p. 811. "Those who associated, at the first preparation of the Liturgy were Shaftesburyists, i.e., Deists, acknowledging a Supreme Being, having moral attributes and holding the Immortal spirits of men accountable in a future state." 1776 CAMPBELL, GEORGE.

"The first edition of his Enquiry into Virtue was published, surreptitiously I believe, in a separate form, in the year 1699; and is sometimes to be met with; by comparing which, with the corrected edition of the same treatise, as it now stands among his works, we see one of the most curious examples that I know, of what is called Limae labor; the art of polishing language, breaking long sentences, and work- ing up an imperfect draught into a highly finished performance."

See 42: 233, for a comment on Shaftesbury in "The History of Europe," a survey of the century just past. "From Lord Shaftesbury's writings, re-echoing many of the sublime and engaging notions of Plato, there arose a school, which founded morality in some principle analogous to sensation or sense, or, at least, to that faculty or power, by which we perceive beauty, grace, and harmony, in external objects. As this was the founda- tion, so was the superstructure, benevolence, generosity, kind affection, compassion, tenderness, and indulgence: in a word, all the amiable, melting, and weeping virtues, were all the vogue. . . .Hence arose such lax moralists as Sterne, and the myriads who condescend to imitate that unprincipled though humourous buffooin."
