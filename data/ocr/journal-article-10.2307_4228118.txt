<plain_text><page sequence="1">JJOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES Vol. XXXIX No. 1 March 2005 Thorstein Veblen's Views on American "Exceptionalism": An Interpretation Rick Tilman A facet of Thorstein Veblen's thought and the intellectual milieu in which he lived remains inadequately explored and explained.' It is his "exceptionalism," that is, his anal- ysis of why Europe and the United States are different. Although Veblen is occasionally mentioned by scholars as having an "exceptionalist" view of America, no systematic or detailed analysis of his "exceptionalism" as such exists. For example, even Dorothy Ross has been casual in her claims about his exceptionalism, her illustrations of them, and her citations. Other writers tend to assume away what needs proving or simply fail to focus on the issue of whether or not Veblen held an exceptionalist view of America. The thesis of American exceptionalism takes various forms when articulated by historians and social scientists, several of which are related to each other and thus form a more or less coherent interpretation of our history.2 In fact, as Ross has argued, there are three generic varieties of American exceptionalism. They are (1) supernaturalist explanations which emphasize the causal potency of God in selecting America as a "city on a hill" for the rest of the world to admire and emulate, (2) genetic interpretations which emphasize racial traits, ethnicity, or gender, and (3) environmental explanations such as geography, climate, availability of natural resources, social structure, and type of political economy.3 For obvious reasons only environmental factors, which are most susceptible to proof or disproof of the claim that America is different not only from Europe but the rest of the world as well, will be used here. Exceptionalists, who roughly speaking were Veblen's contemporaries, argued that American capitalism, an economic system based on private property, sanctity of con- tract, and free exchange, was less conducive to class consciousness, class struggle, and Thanks are due to two anonymous critics for reading earlier drafts of the manuscript and Bob Baron, Bill Waller, Larry MacFarlane, Bill Lyon, Monte Poen, Dwight Mayo, and Al Richmond for stimulating discussions and bibiographic sugges- tions on the thesis of American exceptionalism.

The disharmony and social and civil conflict character- istic of European states was less intense and late in coming to our shores for the follow- ing reasons: (1) The existence of a large frontier in the West and the availability of large tracts of rich agricultural land, ready to be taken up by the dispossessed and the discon- tented, acted as a safety valve in reducing class conflict, social disorder, and ideological politics in cities on the Eastern seaboard. (2) The wealth and the acquisitiveness of American society, that is, rapid economic growth and individual prosperity, caused socialism to founder "on reefs of roast beef and apple pie." A conflict-ridden, class-domi- nated society thus did not develop because most Americans were satisfied with their share of the economic pie or else aspired to the status of those near the top of the eco- nomic ladder and thought a promised "equal opportunity" would ensure those aspira- tions. (3) The superstructural apparatus of capitalism, that is, its prevailing values and culture and the acquiescent, if not supportive, role of its organic intellectuals gave its upper class and its upper middle class satellites "ideological hegemony" and thus politi- cal control. An older and more conventional Marxist variant of exceptionalism stresses the existence of "false consciousness" among the masses, that is, lack of awareness of objective self-interest fostered by the social and cultural apparatus of hegemonic capital- ism. In short, people are not necessarily interested in what is to their interest. (4) Status emulation, that is, conspicuous consumption, conspicuous waste, and conspicuous avoidance of useful labor were powerful social bonding agents and processes which greatly mitigated class-conflict and ideological politics. Thus spoke Frederick Jackson Turner,4 Werner Sombart,s Antonio Gramsci,6 and Veblen.7 Of course, there are sev- eral other variants of these thematic expressions of the exceptionalist thesis and, in fact, other versions of the thesis itself. But because the above variations partly converge with Veblen, or serve to illustrate his thesis, they are emphasized more than other interpretations. Byron Shafer has defined American exceptionalism as the "notion that the United States was created differently, developed differently, and thus has to be understood dif- ferently-essentially on its own terms and within its own context . .. a sense of critical distinctiveness in political, economic, religious, or cultural life ... there do appear to be ... three main uses of the notion of 'American exceptionalism' . .. the first of these con- cerns simple distinctiveness."8 Shafer then turns to the crux of the matter by arguing that the second approach revolves around the assertion that there is a general model of societal progres- sion for the developed nations of the world-and the United States does not fit this model. Over time, two distinct branches of this argument have appeared. Initially, there was the more positive, even self-congratulatory branch, arguing that American exceptionalism was an important addition to the human possi- bility. The ability of the nation to create itself-and the right of the individual within it to do the same-was to be the crucial, diagnostic, American contribu- tion. Much later, there appeared a more questioning, even pejorative branch of</page><page sequence="3">Thorstein Veblen's Views on American "Exceptionalism" 179 the same argument, suggesting that the American experience was inherently unilluminating about the fate of other nations. In this, American exceptionalism was at best a sideshow on the way to societal convergence, at worst an obstacle to that (desired) end.9 Seymour Martin Lipset summarized one important version of exceptionalism that Veblen had to contend with when he interpreted the American past and present. Lipset wrote that [tihe United States, almost from its start, has had an expanding economic sys- tem. The nineteenth-centuryAmerican economy, as compared to the European ones, was characterized by more market freedom, more individual landowner- ship, and a higher wage income structure-all sustained by the national classical liberal ideology. From the Revolution on, it was the laissez-faire country par excellence. Unlike the situation in many European countries, in which eco- nomic materialism was viewed by the traditional aristocracy and the church as conducive to vulgar behavior and immorality, in the United States hard work and economic ambition were perceived as the proper activity of a moral person. ... America was able to avoid the remnants of mercantilism, statist regulations, church establishment, aristocracy, and the emphasis on social class that the postfeudal countries inherited.10 Earlier in the same book, Lipset wrote, The societal aspects of America's exceptionalism refer mainly to the unique class structure and religious system of the country. The first, the emphasis on egalitarian social relations, the absence of a demand that those lower in the social order give overt deference to their betters, and the stress on meritocracy, on equal opportunity for all to rise economically and socially, stemmed, as we have seen, from the twin facts that America was formed as a new settler society and emphasized equality in formulating its national identity."1 Are these, then, the main traits of the thesis of American exceptionalism? Despite the suggestive insights of Shafer, Lipset, and Ross, this is not an easy question to answer because exceptionalism itself is complex and there are several variants of it. In fact, it may refer to social reality, existing and obsolete cultural patterns, social instability and order, class structure, and status and power aspirations as well as economic institutions and their performance. Indeed, Veblen himself can plausibly be interpreted as concerned with all these facets of both the similarities and differences between the United States and Europe. However, the meaning of his exceptionalism will become more evident as I present the pros and cons of his exceptionalism on the basis of textual exegesis of his writ- ing and then develop Veblen's theses regarding American exceptionalism in a novel direction. It is to the first of these two objectives that I now turn.</page><page sequence="4">180 Rick Tilman Veblen's Version of American and European Similarity not Exceptionalism Until recently, the terms "exceptionalism" and "exceptionalist" were mostly used by Marxists and other radicals to designate an aberrant America that had avoided the structural injustices and social evils, or at least perception of them as such, of an older and decadent Europe. At present, the terms denote a similar significance but have ceased to be the peculiar jargon of the far left through adoption by scholars near the cen- ter of the politico-ideological spectrum and even on the right. So there will be no misun- derstanding of how "exceptionalism" and "exceptionalist" are used here, a caveat is in order. The terms do not merely mean that Veblen or other thinkers were greatly influ- enced by America, positively or negatively, its traditions, socioeconomic institutions, and culture. Rather, the main point is that in various ways America and Europe are qualitatively different from each other. Diametrically opposed to this is my use of the term "generic" to mean the opposite of "exceptionalism" and "exceptionalist," that is, to indicate that few or no significant differences exist between the United States and Europe. However, most of the literature on Veblen does not fall clearly into one cate- gory or the other. Neither "generic") nor "exceptionalist" would adequately describe most of the scholarship cited below. 12 During the thirty years that he held academic posts at Chicago, Stanford, Missouri, and the New School for Social Research, Veblen became perhaps the most influential and best-known dissenting social scientist in the United States. His heterodoxy was widely recognized by professional economists and sociologists after the publication of The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), in which Veblen developed his theory of status emulation. In this satirical study of the leisure class and the underlying social strata which emulate it, he contended that individual preferences could not be understood except in relation to the preferences of others because individuals were emulating others in order to strengthen their own sense of self-worth by commanding more social esteem. The assumptions of atomistic individualism and consumer sovereignty deemed valid by microeconomists were thus shown to be specious on social psychological grounds alone. But he never asserted that emulatory processes were peculiar to America or that emulation usually took a different form here. Although prone like many other progressives of his time to focus on the exceptionalist trends in both the writing of the American past and the realities of our historical experience, Veblen developed a unique version of them for his exceptionalism, if it be such, is highly visible in his theory of status emulation. Status emulation takes the form of conspicuous consumption, conspicuous waste, and con- spicuous exemption from useful labor. Emulative behavior, that is, social imitation, competitive striving, and rivalry, is most visible in demonstrated ability to pay, and sta- tus gains are greatest among individuals, groups, and classes most able to conspicuously consume, waste, and avoid useful labor. In Veblen's analysis of the United States and Europe, status gained by these means is linked with power and obviously with class. Consequently, those who live in the North Atlantic community are subject to the hege-</page><page sequence="5">Thorstein Veblen's Views on American "Exceptionalism" 181 mony of those who win the games of status emulation, and it is displayed and reinforced by the spread of their tentacles throughout the social structure, cultural apparatus, and political economy. Veblen's second book, The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904), contains his explana- tion of business cycles and an extended treatment of the cultural and social psychologi- cal significance of the machine process. He argued that instability was endemic in the American business system because of excessive capitalization and credit inflation. His analysis focused on the tendency of firms to borrow too much by exaggerating their future earning power. At some point, their creditors would recognize that loans made to these firms were unwarranted because their earning power was less than anticipated. The loans would then be called in with the inevitable consequences of liquidation and bankruptcy. A protracted period of depression would follow, characterized by large-scale unemployment and unused industrial capacity. Gradually, however, the earning power and credit rating of the firm would move toward convergence and recovery would occur. A period of prosperity would then ensue until overcapitalization and credit inflation recurred and the cycle began anew. Veblen anticipated that the growth of monopoly and wasteful government expenditures might check cyclical instability, but his disciples looked to the social control of industry and better economic planning to offset the defi- ciencies of the system. But since he never specifically focused in detail on business cycles in European countries with an eye to formulating a theory about them, it is difficult to see how The Theory of Business Enterprise, one of his most important books, articulates an exceptionalist stance or posture as such. 13 His focus there on the American economy is not an assertion of how it is qualitatively different from other economies. However, the central feature of Veblen's work as a dissenter was not just his cri- tiques of neoclassical economics, his contributions to business cycle theory, or even his important theory of status emulation. What also sets him off from the conventional par- adigm was his development and use of the dichotomy between business and industry, what his disciples were later to call the "ceremonial-technological dichotomy." Veblen employed it as an analytical device, as an approach to the larger problem of value in eco- nomics, and as part of a theory of social change. In his usage, the business-industry dichotomy was extended to include salesmanship as opposed to workmanship, unearned income versus tangible performance, individual gain as opposed to commu- nity serviceability, invidious emulation versus technological efficiency, and competitive advertising versus the provision of valuable information and guidance. To Veblen, much of the activity in which the business community engaged was wasteful and futile, since the profitability of market exchange did not necessarily measure its social value in achieving the "generic ends of life." However, Veblen was not specific enough about which pursuits are industrial and which are businesslike, or which have both traits. Nev- ertheless, it is clear in retrospect that such judgments depend on the meaning assigned by Veblen to "fullness of life, impersonally considered," which was his way of indicating that the "generic ends of life" are transcultural in nature and often not served by profit</page><page sequence="6">182 Rick Tilman making. The dichotomy between business and industry can be understood, as Veblen intended, if it is recognized that values and processes most conducive to fullness of life-such as idle curiosity, parental concern, and proficiency of workmanship-often cannot be adequately measured by a price system or through market exchange. It follows that business enterprise will often dissipate resources rather than produce commodities that contribute to the generic ends of life. In the final analysis, what is business and what is industry in the Veblenian dichotomy can only be ascertained by reference to these ends. Even though this set him off from European, indeed, most Marxists, who employed the labor theory of value and surplus value doctrine, it otherwise contributes little to the delineation of "exceptionalism" which rests on the assumption of basic differences between America and Europe. Veblen's own analysis of the social psychology of classes makes uncertain the out- come of industrial civilization. On one hand, the machine process has an emancipatory impact on the psyche of industrial workers, turning them against social convention and presumably in favor of socialism. On the other hand, status emulation infects the work- ing class and serves as a social bonding agent to offset the class mentality and conflict induced by the machine process. Status emulation is in turn reinforced by patriotism, as Veblen indicated in The Nature of Peace (1917). Would the machine process triumph and turn the working class against capitalism, as he suggested in The Theory of Business Enterprise, or would emulatory consumption reinforced by patriotism triumph? In the final analysis, despite his pessimism, Veblen did not know or, at least, he did not say. But he clearly saw the same processes at work in Europe in these respects as in America. So how does America differ from Europe, as it must, if he is to be accurately labeled an "exceptionalist"? At this point, it is not evident that Veblen really believed that any of the industrialized nations were basically that different from each other. Indeed, in much of his writing he assumes their generic commonality. This claim can be still further illus- trated as follows. Conventional income distribution theory, that is, marginal productivity theory, according to Veblen, is based on the untenable assumption that remuneration measures production. The modern captain of industry and the absentee owner are thus consid- ered productive agents who receive in remuneration the equivalent of their productiv- ity. Thus their pecuniary activities are not treated as the controlling factor about which the modern economic process turns but are assumed to be productive operations effect- ing the distribution of goods from producer to consumer. At various times, Veblen cast aspersions on all the prevailing theories and rationalizations of the existing distribution of income. He satirized, castigated, or considered irrelevant the abstinence, the risk, and the time-waiting rationales for the receipt of rent, interest and profit, and he indicated that the marginal utility theory was tautological and thus without explanatory power. He also criticized the Marxian theory because he thought it assigned to the individual worker the full value of his labor and ignored the fact that the forces of production were themselves a collective or social legacy and that, consequently, there was no objective</page><page sequence="7">Thorstein Veblen's Views on American "Exceptionalism" 183 way to ascertain the value of an individual's contribution. Although Veblen never spe- cifically articulated a theory of income distribution, his evolutionary view of social change suggests an unending process of adjusting means to ends and ends to means, with community serviceability as the standard of value for all economic activity. But how does this serve to define exceptionalism as an explanation of American uniqueness? As an economic historian and sociologist of growth, Veblen is best known for his "institutionalism," a term coined by Walton Hamilton during the First World War.14 Veblen's theory of economic growth is closely linked with his ideas regarding economic waste. The rate of economic growth cannot be maximized if all output is not serviceable and if efficiency is sacrificed to pecuniary interests. The rate of maximum growth is thus governed by technological advance, which controls the size of the nation's economic surplus, although this rate is also a matter of the disposition of the surplus between ser- viceable and nonserviceable uses. In short, Veblen incorporated a theory of waste-that is, unproductive consumption, investment, and labor-with his theory of social change. This permitted him to show both the conditions under which economic growth stag- nates and those under which it will not be synonymous with the economic welfare of the community. In this way, he clarified the concept of economic efficiency and linked it with the processes of social change and noninvidious economic growth. But, again, it is Western economic growth on which he has focused, not simply American. Veblen's erudition was also evident in his further development of the phases through which he believed humanity has evolved, including the savage, barbarian, handicraft, and industrial stages. He suggested that what separates these stages from each other, in addition to the level of economic development they have reached, is the degree to which predatory instincts have contaminated peaceful, or nonpredatory, traits-the extent to which sporting and pecuniary instincts have influenced the instincts of idle curiosity, parenthood, and workmanship. Again, the last two stages-the handi- craft and the industrial-occurred more or less simultaneously in England and parts of the United States with a lag time of only a few years in the case of the latter. So Veblen's stages of development provide little insight into exceptionalism, although the remnants of the feudal system were certainly larger and their life more protracted in England in the persistence of the monarchy, aristocracy, and established church. Much of Veblen's reputation as a radical dissenter was based on his critique of clas- sical and neoclassical economics. Included in his analysis of the received economic the- ory and doctrines was a rejection of the following: (1) hedonism and utilitarianism, (2) the static bias of price theory, (3) the taxonomic method, and (4) the infection of eco- nomics with teleology. Veblen labeled these deficiencies "pre-Darwinian," that is, rooted in a pre-evolutionary mindset which had not yet come to terms with the scientific revolution of which Charles Darwin was the chief catalyst. Veblen criticized the hedo- nistic and utilitarian theory of portraying humankind as passive agents reacting to exter- nal forces only when impinged upon. His reading in cultural anthropology convinced him that humanity was active rather than quiescent and that, in any case, the</page><page sequence="8">184 Rick Tilman Benthamite claim that pleasure and pain were the "sovereign masters of us all" was merely tautological. When Veblen accused eminent neoclassicists such as his former teacher John Bates Clark and Irving Fisher of mere "taxonomy" he was, of course, charg- ing them with mistaking classification, inventory taking, and labeling with genuine sci- entific explanation, which in his view dealt primarily with the establishment of causal relationships. Indeed, Veblen's essentially negative view of neoclassicism rested on his belief that it failed to move beyond the taxonomic state of inquiry. He was as likely to advance these criticisms against European economists, such as Austrian Carl Menger, as he was his own countrymen. Many of Veblen's ideas regarding the nature of social value were fundamentally dif- ferent from those of the utilitarian tradition that formed the basis of the neoclassical approach to value. Veblen found unconvincing the conventional view of individuals as a "globule of desire" attempting to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. He was also caustic in his repudiation of the moral agnosticism that he found pervasive in the neo- classical view of value as subjective preference measurable only by price. This had led others to the claim that interpersonal comparisons of utility were impossible to measure or irrelevant since consumer preferences were autonomously rooted in private, subjec- tive states of mind. Veblen's rejection of neoclassical value theory did not end in nihil- ism, however, for he outlined an alternative to both neoclassicism and classical Marxism. He wrote of the "generic ends" of life "impersonally considered" and of "full- ness of life"; in his evolutionary, that is, Darwinian mode of analysis, this implied the existence of some transcultural set of values. He found these values embedded in work- manship, parenthood, and intellectual curiosity, all of which flourish in a properly developing society. Veblen meant that proficiency of craftsmanship, altruism, and criti- cal intelligence were dominant values and processes in communities that were develop- ing in a noninvidious manner. However, in communities that were not so developing, these "instincts" or propensities would be contaminated by their opposites, the pecuni- ary and sporting traits which were invidious. Were European communities less likely to be properly developing than those in America? He intimated this to be the case only where politically irresponsible dynasties and predatory military castes were still the order of the day. Veblen attacked the static bias of neoclassicism because it was unable to account for change. General and partial equilibrium theory failed to capture the flux of evolution- ary processes, including both changes in the market mechanism and the underlying institutions that direct and channel exchange. Finally, Veblen criticized neoclassicism for its retention of the residues of teleology that so badly infected classical economics. His most often cited example was the neoclassical claim that equilibrium constitutes a "normal state" of affairs toward which markets inevitably and invariably tend. But Brit- ish and European economists are as guilty of all these sins as Americans, and even with their focus on national economies other than the USA's, there is little in Veblen's eyes to differentiate them as exceptional or their social environments as such either.</page><page sequence="9">Thorstein Veblen's Views on American "Exceptionalism" 185 Veblen's Exceptionalism Interpreted Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that in Veblen's "exceptionalism" class consciousness, class conflict, and ideological politics may occur less in the United States than in Europe. Instead, status emulation, unlimited acquisition, nationalism, and patriotism persist as social bonding agents on our shores. Why then is America's story different from Europe's, or is it? Veblen's later writing is illuminating in several respects. To illustrate, three of Veblen's last books, The Vested Interests and the State of the Industrial Arts (1919), The Engineers and the Price System (1921), and Absentee Ownership and Business Enterprise in Recent Times (1923), focus on the predation and waste of the corporate capitalist order. Writing in a more polemical style than in his earlier works, Veblen endorsed the removal of absentee owners and business-minded executives from the American corporation. He also recommended, perhaps tongue in cheek, that engi- neers and technicians form an alliance with workers and run enterprises themselves. At this point in his career, Veblen interacted for a short time with politically progressive engineers, emphasizing the role they might play in the establishment of an industrial republic. These three books are more useful in differentiating and explicating Veblen's "exceptionalism" than most of the rest of his corpus of work; the reason is that his focus is more explicitly on the United States. Yet these studies, especially the first two men- tioned above, are the least impressive from a scholarly perspective of all his writing. Should his reputation as an "exceptionalist" depend on the weakest and most polemical of his books? My central thesis is that it is from studies like The Vested Interests and the State of the Industrial Arts, The Engineers and the Price System, and, especially, Absentee Ownership and Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution ([19151 1964) that Veblen's "exceptionalism" can best be understood. First, with the exception of Imperial Germany, they are about the United States, its politics, economics, social order, and culture; in short, his nets are not cast so broadly as to include Europe or the rest of the world, although these occasionally enter into his analysis. It is primarily in these studies that he sets forth what is distinctly American and novel in our experience; it is not what is Euro- pean or generic to the human species that catches his eye. Veblen was a specialist in cul- tural studies regardless of whether we label him an "economist" or a "sociologist" or something else. But it was relatively late in his academic career before he concentrated his attention on Anglo-Saxons in Yankeedom, and by then the old ethnic and cultural mix that once characterized America had begun to change. The central part of Veblen's last book, Absentee Ownership, contains his analysis of the American experience since colonial times. It focuses on the myth of self-made man, the independent farmer, and the country town. It also covers the development of the gold mining industry and the exploitation of the timberlands and oil fields, which are portrayed as they evolved under various degrees of absentee ownership. There is a rough overlap between the time span and institutional processes covered by Veblen and the chronology and experience addressed by Turner in his essay, "The Significance of the</page><page sequence="10">186 Rick Tilman Frontier in American History." Veblen's indictment of the frontier experience may be broken into six parts: (1) economic waste and destruction of the natural environment, 15 (2) the traits and function of self-help and cupidity, (3) the role of absentee ownership in exploiting rural America, (4) the oppression of racial minorities, especially Native Amer- icans and blacks, and (5) the very real material progress weighed against the human costs. 16 It is here perhaps more than anyplace that Veblen's exceptionalism is displayed, and his portrait of us is unflattering to say the least. Nevertheless, with the exception of category (4), his portrayal of the United States-be it Zenith City, Sauk Centre, or Winesburg, Ohio-is different from that of Europe. It is not that the moral, cultural, and sociopolitical traits of the Continent do not contain the elements he describes so satirically as dominant in America. It is that these elements which are characteristic of our experience do not exist in such exaggerated form in Europe. In any case, no part of Western Europe seems to have had a frontier experience like our own. Economic Waste and Destruction of the Natural Environment Veblen's analysis in Absentee Ownership is replete with reference to the waste and damage done to the natural environment. The ruination of large stands of timber, the wasteful exploitation of deposits of oil and natural gas, the erosion of valuable topsoil through rapacious farming methods, and the mining of essentially "worthless" metals such as gold all drew Veblen's fire.17 He traced these processes of exploitation, which had their origins in the English settlements in colonial America and which gathered force until they reached culmination in an orgy of waste and destruction in the mid to late nineteenth century-a frenzied assault on the natural environment, aspects of which Veblen directly witnessed during his early years. The frontier experience was, in many ways, a destructive process, and future generations would have to pay its costs. Indeed, many of the wasteful practices Veblen described continued after the date given by Turner for the close of the frontier (1893) and, perhaps, assumed even greater signifi- cance then. Veblen also focused on the often dreary and ugly realities of rural existence that Turner, in his celebration of the frontier experience, was prone to ignore. A conse- quence of the farmer's desire to own a disproportionate amount of land, more than he could reasonably expect to till, was that the farming population was greatly dispersed. The problems of transportation and communication were greatly exacerbated because of distance and providing education for schoolchildren, and adequate medical care was exceedingly difficult in many regions. Veblen also traced a high rate of insanity among housewives to the rural isolation. The Cupidity and Self-Help of the Independent Farmer Veblen wrote in the same spirit as Edgar Lee Masters and Sinclair Lewis, although in more radical tones, when he asserted that</page><page sequence="11">Thorstein Veblen's Views on American "Exceptionalism" 187 [t]he country town of the great American farming region is the perfect flower of self-help and cupidity standardized on the American plan. Its name may be Spoon River or Gopher Prairie, or it may be Emporia or Centralia or Colum- bia. The pattern is substantially the same and is repeated several thousand times with a faithful perfection which argues that there is no help for it, that it is worked out by uniform circumstances over which there is no control, and that it wholly falls in with the spirit of things and answers to the enduring aspira- tions of the community. 18 For Veblen, the life of the independent farmer aimed not at enjoying rural life or basking in the agrarian ethos but, through "hard work and shrewd management," to acquire a "competence" that would enable him some day to take his due place among the absentee owners of the land and so come in for an easy livelihood at the expense of the rest of the community.19 The farmer's desire for acquisition had driven him to work hard, but he was not strongly attached to his work. As Veblen saw him, the independent frontier farmer was in greedy pursuit of a disproportionate share of land rather than in love with the land, making him very unlike European peasant farmers. Veblen stated repeatedly that the incentives of self-help and cupidity of the "Eng- lish-speaking colonial enterprise" resulted in a lack of any "spirit of community interest in dealing with any of their material concerns."20 In his view, it was no accident that the farmer placed little emphasis on social solidarity and harmony or that he lacked any organic sense of community. Both the system of exchange relations and the cultural ethos that underlay economic individualism worked against community solidarity. Veblen commented in the same vein that the farmers' "self-help and cupidity have left them at the mercy of any organization that is capable of mass action and a steady pur- pose."'21 The net result was that their possessive individualism put their own necks under the heel of both local businessmen and large absentee owners. Lurking behind the local front of small businessmen in the country town were those massive business interests whose main function in American society was to get something for nothing. As Veblen put it: In a way the country towns have in an appreciable degree fallen into the posi- tion of toll-gate keepers for the distribution of goods and collection of customs for the large absentee owners of the business. Grocers, hardware dealers, meat-markets, druggists, shoe shops, are more and more extensively falling into the position of local distributors for jobbing houses and manufacturers.22 Although Veblen often attacked absentee ownership of commerce and industry, he had less to say regarding absentee land ownership than he did about the independent farmer with all of his alleged greed.</page><page sequence="12">188 Rick Tilman Racial Oppression on the American Frontier Another facet of social relationships on the frontier was the fate of the black and the Native American. Veblen underscored the role of absentee ownership as a funda- mental part of the plantation system in the American South and observed that "Negro slavery has left its mark on the culture of that section so deeply etched into the moral tis- sues of its people that the bias of it will presumably not be outgrown within the calcula- ble future."23 In his opinion the bias implanted by "the peculiar institution" in the South was rooted as deeply there as the "equally peculiar institution of the Country Town has made the moral bias and spiritual outcome in the North."24 The existence of slavery, of course, presupposed a slave trade, and Veblen fingered the role played by New Englanders in this nefarious traffic. As he sardonically put it: The slave-trade never was a "nice occupation" or an altogether unexceptionable investment "balanced on the edge of the permissible." But even though it may have been distasteful to one and another of its New England men of affairs, and though there always was a suspicion of moral obliquity attached to the slave-trade, yet it had the fortune to be drawn into the service of the greater good. In conjunction with its runningmate, the rum-trade, it laid the founda- tions of some very reputable fortunes at that focus of commercial enterprise that presently became the center of American culture, and so gave rise to some of the country's Best People. At least so they say.25 Veblen's portrayal of the fur trade is also striking for he would have no truck with its "hideous accessories."26 Neither would he countenance this "unwritten chapter on the debauchery and manslaughter entailed on the Indian population of the country by the same businesslike fur trade," which he described as "one of the least engaging chap- ters of colonial history."27 He concluded that, indirectly and unintentionally, but speed- ily and conclusively, the traffic of the fur traders converted a reasonably peaceful and "temperate native population to a state of fanatical hostility among themselves and an unmanageable complication of outlaws in their contact with the white population."28 In summation, it is evident that Veblen saw little of a positive nature in the American fur trade, the plantation system, the slave trade, or white dealings with the black and Native American populations. Indeed, his interpretation of these aspects of the American expe- rience stretching back to colonial times is congruent with his indictment of other systems based on "force and fraud." Material Progress and Ideological Rationalization Although Veblen's criticisms of the values and behavior of the independent farmer were at times scathing, he also commented that "it remains true that they have brought an unexampled large and fertile body of soil to a very passable state of service, and their</page><page sequence="13">Thorstein Veblen's Views on American "Exceptionalism" 189 work continues to yield a comfortably large food supply to an increasing population."29 To a considerable extent, one could trace the American standard of living to the farmer's successful exploitation of science and technology. But Veblen refused to see this frontier source of abundance as a sign merely of progress. Combining irony with the theory of cultural lag, Veblen wrote that "[i]ntellectually, institutionally, and religiously, the country towns of the great farming country are 'standing pat' on the ground taken somewhere about the period of the Civil War, or according to the wider chronology, somewhere about Mid-Victorian times."30 This is consistent with Veblen's conviction that there is little about which to be complacent, for our institutions lag behind scien- tific and technological advance. To most Americans, to be out of date is to be hopelessly wrong, and, therefore, an admission of cultural lag was tantamount to a betrayal of American principles. However, Veblen admitted that this discussion of the American country town unavoidably has an air of finding fault. But even slight reflection will show that this appearance is unavoidable even where there is no inclination to disparage. It lies in the nature of the case, unfortunately. No unprejudiced inquiry into the facts can content itself with anything short of plain speech, and in this connec- tion plain speech has an air of disparagement because it has been the unbroken usage to avoid plain speech touching these things.31 The pungency and severity of his indictment in his last book was also evidence that he had ceased to believe in the likelihood of structural change because the main trends in American life had become congruent with the common sense of the common man. In Veblen's view, much of what passed for common sense was a lack of awareness of objec- tive self-interest. He believed that emulatory consumption patterns and invidious distinc- tions substituted for genuine class consciousness on the part of the rural population. But, in summation of the frontier experience, any meaningful comparison of it on a macro scale would be not with Europe but with the movement of Anglo-Saxons on the frontiers of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution At least on a par with, and perhaps superior to, Absentee Ownership in terms of pro- viding descriptive and theoretical input into our understanding of Veblen's "exceptionalism" is his Imperial Germany. This can be illustrated in several ways in terms of linking cultural patterns and personality traits with the evolving techno-economic base and social environment. For example, Veblen's explanation of the genesis of "indi- vidualism" is expressed in various places in his writing but, perhaps, most prominently in Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution. Where individualism is lacking, or at least deficient, in its development as in Imperial Germany,</page><page sequence="14">190 Rick Tilman the discipline of workday life through these centuries has on the whole been of that personal character that throws immaterial qualities and relations into the foreground of habitual attention and leads to valuations of differential authen- ticity, dignity, caste, class, precedent and precedence; it has in an exceptional degree been the discipline of court, camp, bureaucracy and police.32 He contrasted the causes of the lack of individualism in the German national character with the individualism of the English, which is due to the "town meeting, the open mar- ket and the open road."33 And, to this, he added the impact of the machine process; thus the contrast between the German and the English may also be explained by proximity to the bias and the conditioning of machine technology. As Veblen put it in explanation of the German proclivity for social and political subordination, it has not- taken its bias from the machine shop and the large industry. The intellectual bent and the principles of systematic thinking induced by such discipline do not lie parallel with the mechanistic conception, but rather fall in with that higher range of habits of thought that are spoken of as idealistic, spiritual, tran- scendental; that lead into generalization and subsumptions under immaterial and ulterior categories,-transcendental in the sense of seeking precision and finality by recourse to conceptions that transcend the actualities of sense per- ception.34 The reader is asked to assume England and the English as the surrogate for "Ameri- can" and "exceptionalism" in the above. But even if they do not, it is evident that indi- vidualism as such has theoretical import as cumulative causation and sociocultural aggregation. It is not simply the reductionist consequence of unifactor causal mecha- nisms. For Veblen it was possible without contradiction to be an individualist even though the individual is a product of society rather than its cause. But exceptionalism is not necessarily based on individualism, although the latter is often an important part of it. In fact, the above argument regarding individualism could be interpreted as a viable, nonindividualist explanation of Veblen's exceptionalism. Veblen's indictment of the American business community was long standing, even predating The Theory of the Leisure Class. But Imperial Germany provided him with an opportunity to also make unflattering comparisons between the American and the Ger- man business community. America has unrivalled material resources and a working population nowise inferior to any other for industry under the machine technology; American businessmen have had a free hand and a minimum of burdens in the way of taxes or other government exactions.... The American achievement in this field within the same period has been notoriously less conspicuous and less sub- stantial, e.g., than that of Germany since the formation of the Empire. Nowhere have the businessmen had so full and large a discretion, nowhere have they been favored by government regulations to the same extent-for the reason</page><page sequence="15">Thorstein Veblen's Views on American "Exceptionalism" 191 that nowhere have they controlled the making and administration of the laws in anything like the same degree; and nowhere have they fallen short of their opportunities by so wide a margin.35 Few of Veblen's countrymen, particularly those entrenched in chambers of commerce, would find this comparison a flattering one, but once again he has seized upon the "inep- titude" of the American business community to castigate it for its waste and impractical- ity. To the end of his days, Veblen remained an unrelenting critic of business culture and commercial exploitation; even an analysis of Imperial Germany, a regime not noted for corporate dominance, was viewed by him as an opportunity to vent his spleen. However, here again is an example of his American exceptionalism. At the outbreak of the First World War, he was skeptical regarding the effects of lib- eral democracy on the thinking of Germans. Veblen did not believe that Anglo-Ameri- can ideas would have an immediate impact, because "in the process of assimilation of these alien conceptions of right and honest living, the borrowed theorems concerning civic right and duties . . . have undergone adaptation and revision." The intellectuals who were the medium of the transmission of Western ideas into Germany were so much a part of the concrete German experience that they simply reformulated these ideas in a way that put them at the service of the dynastic state. Because the basic premise of West- ern ideas, such as the principle of personal authority, was the absence of the institution of the dynastic state, the "Pickwickian convolutions" in which they were translated into the German intellectual sphere mitigated them and made them noneffective. Veblen wrote, Neither the sound intelligence nor the good faith of these Intellectuals of the Fatherland is to be impugned. That the-unnecessarily vague and circumlocu- tory-expositions of civic institutions and popular liberty which they have so often and largely promulgated should have been used as a serviceable blind of dynastic state-craft is not to be set down to their discredit. Circumstances over which they could have no control since they were circumstances that shaped their own habits of thought, have placed it beyond their competence to appre- hend or to formulate these alien principles (habits of thought) concretely in those alien institutional details and by the alien logic with which they could have no working acquaintance.36 Veblen's description of the role of the German intellectuals ran parallel to the one he made in Imperial Germany, where he described the importation of modern industrial technology and organization as a force promoting the German dynastic state. Now, instead of modern Western technology, modern Western ideas were being grafted onto a reactionary political structure to promote its survival. The implication of Veblen's book is that the German intellectuals, instead of using their acquired knowledge to criti- cize the government and thus help the German people as a whole to "unlearn" the patri-</page><page sequence="16">192 Rick Tilman otism that fostered their support of the war against their own real interests, became the most ardent and eloquent supporters of that regime. Veblen believed that Western ideas, like Western technology, were essentially in conflict with the reactionary dynastic state and, so, would eventually undermine the lat- ter. This would take time. He was happy to see pseudo-democratic institutions, such as the Reichstag with its universal male suffrage, adopted by the Empire, even though he was under no illusion that it represented a true process of democratization. Such institu- tions would eventually contribute to the demise of the existing absolutism. However, without the imposition of outside force, the transformation of Germany to democratic forms, while inevitable, would be a long one. Veblen liked to distinguish between republics such as the United States, Great Brit- ain, and France and the dynastic systems of Hohenzollern Germany, Hapsburg Austria, and Romanov Russia. Clearly he preferred the republics to the dynasties, which, no doubt, helps explain his support for the Allies after America entered the war. However, his analysis differed both from revolutionary socialists like Lenin, who conflated both kinds of political systems and called for their revolutionary overthrow, and liberals like George H. Mead who asked their fellow citizens to close ranks and make the world safe for democracy. For Veblen perceived the war itself as caused by the larger system of imperialism of which the republics and dynasties were an integral part; yet he remained cognizant of the important differences between the two. It was evident that he believed the longterm chances for peace depended on dismantling the entire system that brought on the war, not simply on an Allied defeat of the Central Powers. Veblen's critique of the dynastic state anticipated the appearance of fascism.37 In Imperial Germany, as we have shown, he described the Hohenzollern dynasty as a volatile fusion of modern science and technology with an antiquated class and religious struc- ture, conservative bureaucracy, entrenched military caste, and quasi-absolutist monar- chy. In the long run, Veblen believed these structures could not co-exist with the new industrial system because their imperatives were not congruent with its maintenance. The opportunity of the dynasty to seize territories it coveted and engage in other acts of unprovoked aggression was rapidly passing away because it could neither live with industrialism or without it. Without the forces of modernity it lacked the military capa- bility to prey on its neighbors, yet with those forces its own institutions would erode under pressures exerted by science and technology, organized labor, and the demands of the underlying population for representative government and peaceable relations with other countries. Later, this scenario was also postulated for fascism. Veblen did not, to be sure, predict the exact form that fascism would take when it came, nor did he fully anticipate the personal characteristics of Hitler and the massively murderous results of his policies. Nevertheless, his prophecies were uncanny for, in rough fashion, he predicted the institutional configurations and nationalist aggression of Nazi Germany long before it occurred. More to the point, however, he actually used his own patented brand of institutional analysis to make these predictions. Thus his suc-</page><page sequence="17">Thorstein Veblen's Views on American "Exceptionalism" 193 cess in predicting the future on these occasions was not due to random chance. Rather, it was a direct consequence of using an institutional approach with its stress on uneven development, cultural lag, and the ultimate incongruity between rigidity of habit and adaptive impulse. The predictable consequences of these phenomena in absolutist sys- tems would be aggression and war unless their archaic political and social structures were modernized, that is, brought in line with their new industrial systems and the scientific and technological adaptive imperatives this suggests. Since anticipations of fascism came relatively late in his career and were among the most accurate predictions he ever made, they were very likely the consequence of the maturation of the institutional theory he had been developing for more than a genera- tion. Of course, the theory, whatever its shortcomings, was the work, in turn, of an alien- ated and estranged individual whose particular kind of social marginality had fostered intellectual iconoclasm and originality. It is important to also note that even though other scholars and intellectuals had access to the same information and observed the same chain of events as Veblen, none had the prescience of mind to anticipate fascism long before it arrived. This may be attributed not simply to Veblen's intellectual bril- liance nor to the novelty of his ideas but to his advantage in possessing and understand- ing the institutional theory of analysis. That he did not predict the rise of fascism in the United States was evidence of his belief that it was different from the European dynastic autocracies. The Generic Persistence of the Retrograde However, John P. Diggins has portrayed Veblen in terms that reveal the persistence of atavistic continuities in human nature and behavior in the latter's thinking and weaken the claim that his interpretation of America is merely "exceptionalist": Man is flawed in two respects, and herein lies the source of his alienation. The first flaw is the curse of animism, the mind's tendency to mediate matter so that man cannot accept facts simply as objects. There can be no knowledge that is not mediated by prior knowledge, by "prevalent habits of thought." The result of man's anthropomorphic predicament is the resistance of society to rational comprehension. The second flaw is the social snare in workmanship itself. Based on the canons of efficiency and social utility, only to be contaminated by the emu- lative instinct, workmanship by its very nature can only promote the perfor- mance principle at the cost of the pleasure principle (to use Freud's terms).38 (Author's emphasis.) Diggins concluded that: Veblen tried to find a way out of both of these dilemmas, the anthropomorphic pre- dicament and the inversion of workmanship into servitude. In place of man's inevita- ble animistic propensities Veblen called for the ascendancy of "the machine</page><page sequence="18">194 Rick Tilman process." The machine "throws out anthropomorphic habits of thought. It compels the adaptation of the workman to his work, rather than the adaptation of the work to the workman." Men must work with the machine and abide by its processes, for the "discipline" of the machine purges all the anthropomor- phic residue in man's nature. The "matter-of-fact" frame of mind is the "cul- tural incidence" of machine technology. Liberated by the machine, man will be able to see things in terms of cause and effect rather than of good and evil, of "weight, tale and measure" rather than of merit or demerit, of natural processes rather than of established rules of precedent, of impersonal objects rather than of personal forces. Veblen welcomed what Henry Adams and Max Weber dreaded: the disenchantment of the world as a result of the extirpation of animism and supernaturalism. Only then will magic, religion, nationalism, the culture of con- sumption, the right of property, and the wastefulness and futility of war cease to make sense to a mind no longer capable of alienating itself because it has been freed from the need to mediate experience in human terms.39 (Author's emphasis.) It should be noted that Veblen did not think it likely, especially late in his career, that such atavistic continuities would soon disappear from the human scene. But he never explicitly stated that they were more likely to disappear in America than in Europe. The reason is that such processes tend to be generically present in every culture, they are not easily or summarily eradicable, and there is no adequate reason to believe they are more or less exceptional in the United States than in Europe. American exceptionalism assumes that the national culture contains a mixture of economic individualism and egalitarian collectivism to be sure, but it is a mixture that focuses on the former through its interpretive lens. Free exchange, private property, sanctity of contract, entrepreneurial initiative, upward mobility, unlimited acquisitiveness, voracious con- sumerism, and avaricious transactionalism are key terms describing the values, institutions, and behavioral traits of the economic individualist. Yet egalitarian collectivism also exists with its focus on economic equality, collective goods, regulatory and welfare insti- tutions, social planning, and harmony. No competent critic of the American social order could ignore both individualist and collectivist tendencies in the system. But exceptionalism is biased toward emphasizing economic individualism as a causal and normative factor in explaining social consciousness and political behavior. It is not surprising that exceptionalists de-emphasize the egalitarian collectivist strain by excluding from the American scene ideological politics of the sort that exude acknowledgement of class structure, class consciousness, and politicized conflict. Try as exceptionalists on the left might to find evidence of such, it is a testimony to their can- dor when they admit the often minor role these attributes actually played in our political development. Even the Marxist Gramsci conceded this with his focus on the ways in which our political consciousness produced "Americanism" in the working class rather than class conscious, ideological politics and proletarian militancy.</page><page sequence="19">Thorstein Veblen's Views on American "Exceptionalism" 195 Obiter Dicta For many left-liberal exceptionalists, the ends or values which might improve the lot of the common man are kept off the political agenda by the mobilization of bias by the vested interests or by lack of awareness of objective self-interest on the part of voters. For these two reasons they often focus on the hegemony of the dominant classes as a pre- ponderant factor and on historical occasions that are an exception to the rule. Slave revolts in the antebellum South, draft riots during the Civil War, and labor unrest and civil disobedience in modern America are their stock in trade and for good reason. Veblen would add to these the retarding effects of cultural lag and the role of the busi- ness community in promoting it to benefit themselves so the advantages of the progress of science and technology will accrue disproportionately to the commerciaVcorporate elite. A generation or so ago, New Left historians started to revolt against the "consen- sus" school led by Louis Hartz and Daniel Boorstin among others. A "conflict" school led by Marxists, populists, and radicals such as William Appleman Williams, Eugene Genovese, James Weinstein, and others began to rewrite American history and reinter- pret the American political, economic, social, and cultural order and its evolution. Part of their reassessment was to challenge the consensus historian's view that our history and social order was basically rooted in shared values, social tranquility, and economic and political stability. The consensus historians had supported and popularized one ver- sion of the exceptionalist interpretation of America during the 1940s and 1950s after Progressive and New Deal revisionists had challenged it earlier. Progressive scholars Charles A. Beard, V. L. Parrington, and J. Allen Smith had criticized earlier versions of "exceptionalism," and their stress was often on social and political conflict, which they believed was as endemic in America as in Europe. Veblen's own version of the Ameri- can past resembled theirs more than it did the consensus view of Hartz and Boorstin that became so influential during the Cold War. Earlier, Turner, Sombart, and Gramsci were said to have views akin to Veblen in certain respects on the differences between America and Europe. They are cited because they were more nearly Veblen's contemporaries and due to similarities in their analysis of exceptionalism. Even so, Veblen's views differ from all three in that he does not think that America is as different from Europe as did they. To illustrate, he did not share Turner's optimism regarding the future of the American republic or his view of the fron- tier experience as producing a democratic, egalitarian culture. Veblen's exceptionalism does share with Sombart the recognition that Americans have a higher standard of liv- ing than Europeans, Germans in particular, and this precludes the fuller development of class-conscious, ideological politics, and proletarian militancy. But Veblen empha- sized even more than Sombart that much of the wealth and income differential is dissi- pated in ostentatious display and status emulation and does not lead to "fullness of life." Gramsci's focus was on "Americanism" among the working classes as a form of false con- sciousness, that is, lack of awareness of objective self-interest. But, contrary to Veblen, it</page><page sequence="20">196 Rick Tilman assumed that proletarian militancy harnessed by an intellectual vanguard to revolution- ary objectives is somehow the norm in industrial societies with the single exception of the United States. Was Veblen an "exceptionalist" in his interpretation of the American past and pres- ent? In summation, his views are sui generis as he does not fit into facile categories of interpretation or scholarly taxonomy. This is not novel or enlightening because much the same could be said of several other important thinkers of his era-an unusually fer- tile period in the genesis and proliferation of innovative social theory and criticism. What is new is the manner in which he combined different but ultimately convergent strains of thought by weaving them together into the unique Veblen tapestry. In his later writing, George F. Babbitt and Winesburg, Ohio, Mark Twain, and Theodore Dreiser40 mesh with the insights of social psychology and cultural anthropology. Along with Dar- win, Bellamy, Turner, Sombart, Karl Marx and the pragmatists, an eclectic fusion and replication occur which add a new twist to economics. To label Veblen's views "exceptionalist," "conventional," or otherwise is to substitute stereotype for analysis of the way and means by which his critical-genetic method illuminates past, present, and, perhaps, the future. No other American thinkers of his time, with the possible excep- tions of John Dewey and John R. Commons, tell us as much as we need to know about our social order. But the truth is complex and the evidence ambivalent about his exceptionalism. In fact, it is primarily in his last writings, especially Imperial Germany ([1915J 1964) and Absentee Ownership (1923), that textual exegesis buttresses the claim that he believed the United States to be different in certain basic ways from Europe. Even here the case he makes is equivocal. The corpus of his work, on balance, suggests that he believed that after the Industrial Revolution techno-economic convergence began to occur on both the North American and European continents. This weakens the exceptionalist thesis regarding Veblen and forces his interpreters to acknowledge the emergent generic traits he attributes to all existing industrial cultures. Yet atavistic continuities as well as their opposites persist in both American and European societies, and in Veblen's view "exceptionalism" was no exception to the rule. Conclusion After this lengthy and detailed analysis of Veblen's "exceptionalism," is it possible to draw any theoretical conclusions regarding the key perspectives that underpin exceptionalism and, more importantly, can a comparison of Veblen's theoretical per- spective be made with these? Specifically, underpinning some of the arguments against exceptionalism are views such as (1) all socioeconomic systems go through the same sequence of stages of development or (2) one stage or form of society is the natural or most efficient. Version 1 is found in Marxism and elsewhere. Version 2 is characteristic of much conservative thinking, including Francis Fukuyama's End of History. If valid,</page><page sequence="21">Thorstein Veblen's Views on American "Exceptionalism" 197 both 1 and 2 would undermine an exceptionalist argument that America represents a unique or special development. Strikingly, there are strong arguments against both 1 and 2 in Veblen's writing that suggest that all socioeconomic formations are likely to be exceptional in some respects. In particular, Veblen foreshadowed the modern concept of path dependence. For example, in The Theory of Business Enterprise, Veblen wrote, "any appreciable deviation may forthwith count in a cumulative manner"41 and hinted, as elsewhere, at positive feedbacks leading to cumulative divergence. Hence there is a strong prima facie case that Veblen would have favored some argu- ments supporting some versions of exceptionalism. If there is path dependence and a "penalty of taking the lead" as Veblen upheld, then convergence between the United States and Europe is put into question. Geoff Hodgson has summarized Veblen's view on this issue: Contrary to much Marxist and neoclassical thinking, Veblen argues that multi- ple futures are possible. Equilibrating forces do not always pull the economy back onto a single track. This exposes a severe weakness in Marx's conception of history. Although Veblen has socialist leanings, he argues against the idea of finality or consummation in economic development. Variety and cumulative causation mean that history has "no final term." In Marxism the final term is Communism or the classless society, but Veblen rejects the teleological concept of a final goal. This means a rejection of the ideas of the "inevitability" of social- ism and of a "natural" outcome or end-point in capitalist evolution. There is no natural path, or law, governing economic development. Accordingly, and in rejecting any inevitability in capitalist evolution, Veblen accepts the possibility of varieties of capitalism and different paths of capitalist development.42 Veblen's evolutionary perspective and his cultural lag theory stressed the likelihood of atavistic continuities and left him uncertain of the future because blind drift was as likely an outcome as any. It seems that institutional analysis would be especially valuable in examining the multitude of regimes around the world, from fundamentalist Iran to the former Soviet Union, where discontinuities between political and economic institu- tions exist. A significant test of the viability of any social theory is its ability to forecast the future before it arrives. A theory such as Veblen's, which stresses the degree of mal- leability of a cultural and institutional overlay under pressure from an evolving techno- cratic structure, promises insight into the nature of change in an unstable world. Historians carefully avoid long-term predictions, and social theorists, whether on the basis of economics, sociology, or psychology, are ill equipped to make them reliably. The "method of institutional analysis" was used by Veblen, not as a crystal ball, but as a way of understanding economic and social behavior and their continuities and disconti- nuities. It also offered illumination of both the differences and similarities between "exceptionalist" America and Europe. Techno-economic convergence in parts of both the North American and European continents weakens the exceptionalist thesis regarding him and compels his interpreters</page><page sequence="22">198 Rick Tilman to acknowledge the emergent generic traits he attributed to both the machine process and the ethos of science and their supportive structures. Yet atavistic continuities as well as their opposites persisted in both American and European societies in his analysis. The pervasiveness of corporate/commercial hegemony, anarchic and nihilistic individ- ualism, religious conservatism, invidious consumption, and chauvinism were all cases in point. At times, Veblen held a quasi-exceptionalist view of America, to be sure, but it must be seen in a continuous state of tension with the generic proclivities of it and other industrial states of his time. Ronald Steel has recently written: Wilsonianism is not primarily the doctrine of democracy or of international- ism. It is the doctrine of American exceptionalism. It is the "city on the hill" expanded to global dimensions, the ideological companion to American hege- mony.43 (Author's emphasis.) Although Veblen did not engage in pro-war interventionist propaganda before U.S. entry into the Great War in April 1917, he is known to have favored the Allied cause. Indeed, he worked for the Federal Food Administration during the war in several capacities, which is probably evidence where his sympathies really lay. Yet his review of J. M. Keynes' The Economic Consequences of the Peace after the War contains a scathing cri- tique of the actors in and the immediate aftermath of the Versailles Conference and its treaty.44 He had already come to the recognition that Wilsonian idealism, that is, a com- mitment to the spread of liberal democracy, the League of Nations, and international peace and reconciliation as well as the self-determination of captive peoples, and nonintervention were badly compromised. However much he had supported, or at least acquiesced with, exceptionalist claims by President Woodrow Wilson about American intent and policy during the war, he now shared the common disillusionment of liberal intellectuals about the outcome of the war. Is this simply more evidence of his inability to consistently adhere to either an exceptionalist or anti-exceptionalist interpretation of America? Veblen avoided the extremes of both utopian universalism and insular nationalism in his reasoning about politics among nations. Yet he was clearly much closer to the for- mer in terms of where his sympathies actually lay, which undermines even further the case that can be made for his exceptionalism. If at times he approached an optimistic global universalism as regards his political and ideological predilections, he always avoided a narrow cultural and nationalistic fatalism, which in the final analysis gives the lie to claims that he was an exceptionalist, insofar as focus is on his interpretation of international relations. Advocates of his exceptionalism must turn to other aspects of his work to buttress their case. For many, Veblen was a seer with an ethical and aesthetic message; for others, he was simply an iconoclastic social scientist. Although his significance is still disputed, his ideas of conspicuous consumption, waste, and avoidance of useful labor have relevance in explaining not only class hegemony but also consumer behavior, corporate preda-</page><page sequence="23">Thorstein Veblen's Views on American "Exceptionalism" 199 tion, international politics, militarism, sport, and fashion. Moreover, Veblen can be credited with explaining the link between ostentatious display and the oppression and subjugation of women. Still, his explanations as predictive and retrodictive theory are mostly generic and only on occasion are they any more applicably American than European. Despite his desire to make sense of and explain American culture, Veblen knew there was no "homogeneous, stable, uniform and universally shared concept of Amer- ica."45 Indeed, within his epistemic framework giving homogeneity to the heteroge- neous, uniformity to the diverse, and stability to the variable makes more sense if the idea of America and the American mind are subsumed under the generic.46 Veblen's social theory and intellectual perspective are a branch on the tree of Western culture, not an exemplification of American exceptionalism. Notes 1. The most detailed study of Thorstein Veblen is Joseph Dorfman, Thorstein Veblen and His America (New York: Viking Press, 1934). This study is flawed in several respects; correctives to it include Rick Tilman, Thorstein Veblen and His Critics, 1891-1963 (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1992) and The Intellectual Legacy of Thorstein Veblen: Unresolved Issues (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1996); Elizabeth and HenryJorgensen, Thorstein Veblen: Victorian Firebrand (Armonk, N.Y.: M.

Most recently, see Rick Tilman, Thorstein Veblen, John Dewey, C. Wright Mills, and the Generic Ends of Life (Lanham, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004), esp. chapter 1. 2. See the following interpretations of the thesis of American exceptionalism: Seymour Martin Lipset, American Exceptionalism: A Two Edged Sword (New York: Norton, 1996); Byron E. Shafer, ed., Is America Different? (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991); Kim Voss, The Making of American Exceptionalism (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1993); Dorothy Ross, Origins of American Social Science (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991); and David M. Wrobel, The End of American Exceptionalism (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1993). 3. Ross also perceptively commented: I should make clear, therefore, lest there be any room for doubt, that my examina- tion of the ideology of American exceptionalism is a critique of this idea of Ameri- can uniqueness, not an endorsement. While claiming to describe the American world as it was, exceptionalism instead distorted that world, providing a simplistic and idealized vision of the United States and exaggerating American uniqueness. The idea of American difference and the ideology of American exceptionalism has nonetheless played an extremely important role in American life and deeply shaped the structure of social and political thought. This ideology has, I believe, made American experience more different from that of other countries than would have been the case had Americans developed a more differentiated view of themselves. In this limited sense, I plead guilty to a species of American</page><page sequence="24">200 Rick Tilman exceptionalism.

It is true that Ross explicitly labeled Veblen an exceptionalist (see pp. 204-17). It is also the case that E. K. Hunt saw almost no qualitative differences between Veblen's portrayal of the United States and Europe, although he did not use the term "generic" to designate his inter- pretation (pp. 120-131). Nevertheless, there is no such clear-cut delineation of the differ- ences between the two interpretations or their application in most of what has been written in English on Veblen. Cf.

Recently, Peter Scott has shown how Veblen's theory of business cycles can be used to explain cyclical behavior in economies far removed from fin de siecle America.

Veblen, Absentee Ownership and Business Enterprise in Recent Times, chap. 7. 17. So, e.g., in much of the countrywhere the ground was covered with hardwood timber it was in its time not unusual for the impecunious settlers to raise some slight funds for urgent use by hastily felling the stand of timber, burning it, and selling the ash, which was used for making potash. So also, in the same sections, as well as in many places where the land was timbered with pine and hemlock, it has not been unusual to construct fences by felling the timber along the fence-line in such a way as to make a barrier of it to serve the purpose of a fence by cumber- ing the ground. The Independent Farmers were commonly very nearly penniless, and so were driven to many ingenious devices to find ready money, at the same time that their competitive enterprise in land-grabbing scattered them and their work out over wide spaces of half-wild country with long distances and atrocious roads, leaving them far out of reach of reasonable transportation. They were (commonly) unable to buy or to bring in anything like the equip- ment and materials required in their work. So they took this way out of present difficulties at the cost of the future; and the future, which has now become the present, is paying the cost in a scarcity of timber. (Veblen, Absentee Ownership, 1923, 188) In point of material usefulness, then, it seems fair to say that the production of gold is pure waste-more especially the production of more than is currently taken up in the arts-and that this waste commonly exceeds the total value of the product.

The "efficiency engineers" have no hesitation about saying that the businessmen's management of industry has resulted in a wasteful use of the equipment and labor employed, sometimes rising to figures fairly incredible to the common layman. This waste may be more or less, but it is a systematic result of the management of industrial enterprises by the self-made businessman. At the same time the efficiency engineers' criticism takes no account of the waste involved in downright unemployment or stoppage of workmen and plant, due to the pecuniary strategy of the same conservative businessmen, although this item of waste doubtless exceeds by several fold that caused by incompetent management while the plant is running.
