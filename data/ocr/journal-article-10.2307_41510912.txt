<plain_text><page sequence="1">STEVEN T. BROWN Machinic Desires: Hans Bellmer's Dolls and the Technological Uncanny in Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence There ore no human beings in Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence. The characters are all human-shaped dolls. - Oshii Mamoru One of the most distinctive aspects of Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence , Os- hii Mamoru s 2004 sequel to the highly acclaimed feature-length anima- tion Ghost in the Shell (1995), is the films obsession with the uncanniness of ningyõ (literally, "human-shaped figures") in the form of dolls, puppets, automata, androids, and cyborgs. In interviews, Oshii has acknowledged the importance of the concept of the uncanny ( unheimlich in German; bukimina in Japanese) and its relation to ningyõ for an understanding of Ghost in the Shell 2.1 This concern is one that the sequel shares with the first movie, but Ghost in the Shell 2 goes well beyond the earlier film in the scope of its engagement. Of particular interest is Ghost in the Shell 2 s repeated references to the erotic grotesque dolls constructed and photographed by German Surrealist Hans Bellmer (1902-1975). In this essay, I explore Ghost in the Shell 2's interme- dial play with various ningyõ and how such engagements enter into the film s complex evocations of the uncanny at the limits of the human. 00Q</page><page sequence="2">Any study of the uncanny must acknowledge at the outset how much it owes to the pioneering efforts of not only Sigmund Freud but also Ernst Jentsch,2 the earliest writers to analyze the variety of complex phenomena associated with the uncanny and attempt to account for it in psychological and/or psychoanalytic terms. In addition, an enormous amount of critical at- tention has been given to Freud s essay on "The "Uncanny"' (1919) by contem- porary philosophers, literary theorists, and cultural critics such as Jacques Derrida, Hélène Cixous, Sander Gilman, Neil Hertz, Samuel Weber, and Nich- olas Royle.3 In most cases, such post-Freudian readers of the uncanny have fo- cused their analysis on deconstructing Freuds reading of E. T. A. Hoffmanns "The Sandman" (1816). 4 In what follows, I am more concerned with discussing the uncanny as a literary and artistic motif with philosophical implications than I am in the explanatory power of Freudian discourse to account for the psychosexual etiology of the uncanny. In other words, I am less interested in rereading Freud s (mis) reading of "The Sandman," or in critiquing psychoana- lytic metanarratives such as the "castration complex" or "death drive," than I am in unpacking the function of the trope of the uncanny in Ghost in the Shell 2. Indeed, I argue that engagements with the uncanny appearing in Ghost in the Shell 2 should be regarded not so much as Freudian gestures on the part of Oshii as they are byproducts of Oshiť s remediation5 of the dolls of Hans Bellmer, which were explicitly designed to evoke the uncanny on many levels: more specifically, in terms of the repetition of déjà vu, the blurring of bound- aries between life and death, animate and inanimate, and the doppelgänger. What binds together all of these instances of the uncanny is that in each case, the uncanny evokes a sense of unfamiliarity at the heart of the familiar, a feeling of unhomeliness in the home, an estrangement of the everyday. The defamiliarizations produced by the uncanny in Ghost in the Shell 2 work to de- stabilize our assumptions about what it means to be human in a posthuman world and how we might relate to all the ningyõ with whom we increasingly share the world. "ONCE THEIR STRINGS RRE CUT, THEY EASILY CRUMBLE" In his essay "From Wooden Cyborgs to Celluloid Souls: Mechanical Bodies in Anime and Japanese Puppet Theater," Christopher Bolton points out the strong analogy in the first Ghost in the Shell movie between cyborgs and tra- ditional Japanese puppet performance ( ningyõ jõruri ) with respect to "the M AC H I N I С DESIRES 223</page><page sequence="3">VI5UAUY, THE PUPPET MOTIF APPEARS REPEATEPUy IN CONJUNCTION WITH SCENES IN WHICH ONE CHARACTER UTERAUY OR METAPHORICALLY "PUW-S THE STRINGS" OF ANOTHER VIA CyBERBRAIN HACKINö ANP MANIPULATION. Ц 1 divide between body and voice" that is "foregrounded by the ventriloquistic me- dium of animation."6 There is no ques- tion that puppet-like characters and the division of body and voice are also im- portant to the world of Ghost in the Shell 2. During the course of their investiga- tions into a series of gruesome crimes committed by female androids called "gy- noids"7 - "hyper-realistic female robot [s] created specifically for sexual com- panionship"8 who have murdered their owners after apparent malfunctions and then self-destructed - Batou and his new partner Togusa encounter nu- merous figures who are likened to puppets and confronted with their lack of control over their own actions and identity. This concern with puppets is announced to us in the soundtrack that plays as the opening credits roll in a choral melody composed by Kawai Kenji (with three variations repeated dur- ing the course of the film), entitled "Song of Puppets" ( Kugutsu uta), which tells of a legendary Japanese creature called a "nue," with a monkey s head, raccoon dogs body, tiger s legs, and snakes tail, who sings in grief about the inanimate spirits of flowers, which lament "their being in this world of life, / Their dreams having faded away," awaiting the dawn of a new world in which the "gods will descend."9 The nue is a chimera, able to turn itself into a black cloud, that brings misfortune and malady to those it visits, such as in the famous episode from the Tale of the Heike, where it is said to have made Em- peror Konoe (r. 1141-1155) sick before being vanquished by Minamoto no Yo- rimasa (1106-1180). In the context of Ghost in the Shell 2, as the nues "Song of Puppets" is played over the opening credits, we witness the manufacture and assembly of a gynoid. Insofar as the ontological status of puppets (and their close cousins: dolls, automata, robots, cyborgs) and their relation to humans haunts the entire film, the elegiac "Song of Puppets" seems to announce not only the disappearance of completely organic human beings, whose "dreams having faded away" grieve and fall like the flowers mentioned in the song, but perhaps also the corruption of innocence that Oshii associates with the an- thropomorphization of dolls and robots. But even as it nostalgically mourns the loss of beauty and innocence, the nue also announces the dawn of a new world. What that new world entails is the subject of Ghost in the Shell 2. Visually, the puppet motif appears repeatedly in conjunction with scenes in which one character literally or metaphorically "pulls the strings" of an- other via cyberbrain hacking and manipulation. In the world of Ghost in the 224 STEVEN T. BROWN</page><page sequence="4">Shell 2, cyberbrain hacking is associated with "the implantation of virtual ex- periences, including false memories, in order to steal information or control the victim."10 In the futuristic setting of the story, which takes place in the year 2032 in unnamed multiethnic Asian cities (modeled after Hong Kong, Taipei, Manhattan, and Milan), Batou and most of his colleagues in Section 9 have cyberbrain implants, which are electronic components that facilitate direct access to massive information networks and memory storage in cyber- space, as well as other functions such as silent communication transmissions. Although clearly augmenting human capability, such implants also make one vulnerable to hackers, despite the existence of attack barriers that are sup- posed to help prevent infiltration but cannot guarantee it. Scenes of puppet-like cyberbrain manipulation are foregrounded throughout Ghost in the Shell 2. For example, when Batou and Togusa pay a visit to the Kõjinkai yakuza gang, a local crime syndicate suspected in the murder of Jack Volkerson (a shipping inspector for the company that manu- factures the gynoids), Batou defeats his opponents in the gun battle that en- sues by hacking into their cyberbrains and infiltrating their technologically augmented vision centers so that they shoot at a holograph of Batou rather than at Batou himself. In the process, Batou also subdues a yakuza cyborg outfitted with an illegal Chinese prosthetic limb known as "the claw" and manipulates him like a marionette. In the convenience store scene that fol- lows, which is a spectacular blend of three-dimensional computer-generated backgrounds and two-dimensional eel- style characters melded together into a hybrid form that astonishes with the sheer complexity of visual detail,11 it is Batou himself who becomes the object of "ghost-hacking" and is manipu- lated like a puppet, probably by the professional hacker Kim at the request of Locus Solus (literally, "solitary place"), the company that manufactures the gynoids. In order to protect Batou from himself, as well as other patrons in the store, Ishikawa zaps Batou's cyberbrain implants. Batou later does the same to Togusa during a visit to Kims mansion when Togusa is brain-hacked by Kim and subjected to a series of hallucinations, including scenes in which both he himself and Batou have turned into automata. Although Togusa is the least cybernetic member of the Section 9 team, he is nonetheless vulner- able to ghost-hacking due to his cyberbrain implants. The uncanny blurring of boundaries between the animate and the inani- mate, the living and the dead, is clearly exemplified by puppet-like characters, but the uncanny is also evoked in scenes involving cyberbrain hacking and e- brain communication. In recent years, there has been quite a bit of debate in the United States about the constitutionality (or lack thereof) of warrantless M AC H I N I С DESIRES 225</page><page sequence="5">wiretapping performed by the National Security Agency for purposes of do- mestic spying on suspected terrorist subjects. What Ghost in the Shell 2 offers is a meditation on ontological wiretapping or electronic telepathy. If warrant- less wiretapping violates free speech and privacy rights, ontological wiretap- ping (or electronic telepathy) undercuts the very existence of the stable sub- ject to which such rights supposedly accrue.12 What makes such instances of electronic telepathy profoundly uncanny is that, as Andrew Bennett and Nicholas Royle have suggested, they involve "the thought that your thoughts are perhaps not your own, however private or concealed you might have as- sumed them to be."13 Of course, this also raises serious questions about the status and au- thenticity of memory. If one s memories are not entirely ones own, if virtual memories are as vivid and realistic as actual memories, then how does one know whether ones memories are real or simply fake memories that have been implanted like those of the replicants in Ridley Scotts Blade Runner (1982)? In the first Ghost in the Shell , Batou expresses a thoroughgoing skepti- cism about the possibility of distinguishing the real from the virtual: "Virtual experiences, dreams. ... All data that exists is both reality and fantasy," says Batou to Kusanagi. And he articulates similar views in Ghost in the Shell 2, where he affirms that "there is no way to distinguish reminiscence from true memory" and asks Togusa: "Do your wife and daughter, waiting for you at home, really exist? . . . Your family exists only in your mind." In so doing, Ba- tou draws an implicit comparison between Togusa and a ghost-hacked trash collector who appeared in the first Ghost in the Shell , whose implanted memo- ries led him to believe that he was living with his wife and daughter, when, in fact, he was living alone.14 And on this matter at least, Batou is in agreement with the philosophically inclined hacker Kim in Ghost in the Shell 2, who ex- plicitly questions how one can distinguish between physical reality and "an extension of false illusions generated by virtual signals." "Humans," argues Kim, "are nothing but the thread from which the dream of life is woven." With memory and subjectivity destabilized in this way, it is no wonder that characters in the world of Ghost in the Shell are frequently subjected to acts of ventriloquism, in which one is used as the mouthpiece for another. This ventriloquism is perhaps most pronounced in Ghost in the Shell 2 in terms of the unbridled intertexuality of its screenplay. The dialogue of Ghost in the Shell 2 is replete with layer upon layer of literary, religious, philosophi- cal, and scientific citations, ranging from the Buddha to Confucius, from the Bible to Milton, from Zeami to Gogol, from Julien Offray de La Mettrie to Richard Dawkins. 226 STEVEN T. BROWN</page><page sequence="6">Among the many quotations appearing in the film is one that is repeated time and time again. After the spectacular festival scene, as Batou interrogates an informant in an effort to determine the whereabouts of Kim, Togusa spots a stone plaque on the wall of a mausoleum in ruins, on which is inscribed the following poem: "Life and death come and go like marionettes dancing on a table. Once their strings are cut, they easily crumble (, Seishi no kyorai suru wa hõtõ no kairai tari issen tayuru toki raku raku rai raí)"15 Oshii underscores the importance of language in his animated cinema not only by the tissue of quo- tations he interweaves throughout but also by visually foregrounding specific quotations such as this as texts on the screen. The same poem appears again as Kim s "dying message"16 in the form of a hologram (see Figure 1). Later, it shows up yet again painted on a wall inside the offshore factory ship belong- ing to Locus Solus. Although Ghost in the Shell 2 is replete with quotations, this is the only one that is repeated multiple times and linked either directly or indirectly to Locus Solus, Inc., and its manufacture of gynoids. Clearly, it is significant to the animated world that Oshii has constructed. So how are we to interpret it? First, it should be pointed out that this quotation is from a poem in- cluded in a treatise by the Muromachi-period noh playwright and actor Zeami (C.1363-C.1443) entitled "Mirror of the Flower" (1424, Kakyõ ).17 Taking into consideration the Buddhist connotations and genealogy of the poem, a more figure i. An image of the poem that constitutes Kim's calling card and eventually his dying mes- sage. Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence. M AC H I N I С DESIRES 227</page><page sequence="7">literal translation might be: "Cycles of birth and death come and go, a pup- pet dances on the stage. When one string is cut, it collapses and crumbles." In the context of noh drama, Zeami uses this poem to advise the actor that he must "make his mind [function] like [these] strings, and without its being perceived by anyone."18 In other words, when playing a particular role, the noh actor must learn to create the illusion that a character has come to life on the noh stage, just like a marionette manipulated by a puppeteer. The perfor- mance of noh relies upon forms of artifice not unlike the strings of a puppet. In the context of Ghost in the Shell 2, this quotation from Zeami's "Mirror of the Flower" treatise underscores the function of citationality throughout the film, as well as the performative aspect of animation itself. At the formal level, the technique of interspersing quotations with dia- logue is one that Oshii openly borrows from French New Wave director Jean- Luc Godard, who has made great use of such citationality in his films. Godard is well known for rejecting the continuity editing of classical Hollywood cin- ema and offering instead "a discontinuous and fragmentary narrative style that breaks up time and space, thereby forming a collage of letters, words, images, sounds, music, voices, paintings, quotations, and references to art and cinema."19 Godard s employment of quotation, in particular, adds a dis- tinctive dimension to his films that foregrounds the status of language in cinema, with "words and images interminglfing] constantly,"20 "infusing the image with language,"21 thereby creating a sort of "cinematic essay"22 that constantly reminds us that we are viewing a film that is the product of the director s arbitrary choices. However, in addition to being an obvious homage to Godard,23 1 would argue that Oshiť s use of citationality in Ghost in the Shell 2 also serves a larger philosophical purpose in relation to the ventriloquism of the puppet theater. Such citationality foregrounds not simply the ventriloquism of the director or screenplay writer but, more importantly, the ventriloquism of the flows of transnational cultural production, as has been discussed by numer- ous contemporary critical theorists. "Who speaks and acts?" asks philoso- pher Gilles Deleuze. "It is always a multiplicity, even within the person who speaks and acts."24 In short, the subject becomes a tissue of citations. The numerous literary, poetic, philosophical, and scientific quotations in Ghost in the Shell 2 underscore the extent to which its characters are akin to talk- ing dolls - mouthpieces for the sociocultural machinery and transnational flows that intersect them. By foregrounding the transnational intertextuality of human subjectivity, Oshii underscores the extent to which we are thor- oughly mediated animals, with no authentic thoughts or intentions but only 228 STEVEN T. BROWN</page><page sequence="8">always already mediated thoughts and intentions. This citationality at the narrative level is paralleled at the visual level by a city that is overflow- ing with signs and advertisements, a thoroughly commodified urban space not unlike what one finds in the shopping districts of Tokyo, Osaka, or Hong Kong today. In his directors notes for the film, Oshii has com- T HE NUMEROUS LITERARY POETIC, PHILOSOPHICAL-, AMP SCIENTIFIC QUOTATIONS IN GHOST IN THĚ Z UHVBRSCOKB THE EXTENT TO WHICH ITS CHARACTERS ARE AKIN TO TALKING POLLS- MOUTHPIECES POR THE SOCIOCULTURAL MACHINERY ANP TRANSNATIONAL FLOWS THAT INTERSECT THEM. 1 1/-^ mented on the ubiquity and importance of signs (especially those using Chi- nese characters) to the visual appearance of the urban landscapes in Ghost in the Shell 2. 25 This ubiquity of signs and unavoidability of mass media suggests that the city itself and almost everyone in it is subject to the mechanisms of commodification: "reality" dissolves into the virtuality of mass media.26 In such a world, human beings start to resemble automata. FROM PUPPETS TO AUTOMATA Although there is no question that a significant proportion of imagery in Ghost in the Shell 2 resonates with the history of the puppet theater in Japan, the Japanese puppet theater does not go far enough to account for the ap- pearance in the film of the plethora of doll-like figures of varying types, which extend far beyond that of traditional puppets. In particular, Ghost in the Shell 2 also places great emphasis on two types of dolls that are quite distinct from the dolls of the Japanese puppet theater: mechanical dolls or automata, called karakuri ningyõ, on the one hand, and the gynoids inspired by the dolls photographed by Hans Bellmer, on the other. Before turning to the gynoids and their relaton to the dolls of Bellmer, it is worth spending some time to unpack the role played by karakuri ningyö and their relation to the uncanny. Japan has a long history of mechanical dolls, stretching back as far as the seventh century, when a doll that could indicate directions by means of an internal compass was presented to Empress Saimei (r. 655-661) in the year 658 by the Buddhist priest Chiyu.27 Perhaps the most famous ancient Japa- nese mechanical doll is one that was developed during the ninth century by Prince Kaya (794-871) in response to a terrible drought that was choking the rice fields throughout the land. Prince Kaya, who, in addition to being the son of Emperor Kanmu (r. 781-806), was known as a skilled craftsman, devised M А С H I N I С DESIRES 229</page><page sequence="9">a mechanical doll to aid a local temple that was particularly affected by the drought, as recounted in the Konjaku monogatari (Tales of Times Now Past ) from the twelfth century: He made a doll in the shape of a boy about four feet tall, holding a jug up- raised in both hands. It was devised so that when it was filled with water the water would instantly pour down over the boy s face. Those who saw it brought ladles full of water so that they could fill the jug and watch the boy's face get wet. It was a great curiosity; the news spread, and soon all the capi- tal was there, pouring water and loudly enjoying the fun. And all the while, naturally, the water was collecting in the fields. When the fields were fully inundated, the Prince took the doll and hid it. And when the water dried up, he took the doll out and set it up again. Just as before, people gathered to pour water, and the fields were inundated. In this manner the fields were kept safe from harm.28 WHAT SHARPl-У PISTINÖUISHES AUTOMATA SUCH AS KARAKURI NtN&amp;yÕ PROM THE VOU&amp; ЕМРЮУЕР IM THE JAPANESE PUPPET THEATER IS THE FORMER'S MECHAMISM OF SEt-F-AMIMATIOM^ 4/ - - 1 Like many other dolls that were later developed in medieval and early mod- ern Japan, Prince Kayas mechanical doll, which is known as the mizukumi ningyõ, or "water-splashing doll," combined practical technology with entertainment. Another famous early example dates back to the Muromachi period (1392-1573), when Gosukõin (1372-1456), the father of Emperor Go- hanazono (r. 1428-1464), describes in his diary an "elaborate mechanical doll tableaux reenacting famous battle scenes such as Yoshitsunes perilous cliff descent at the Battle of Ichinotani or the great hunt on Mount Fuji of the Soga Brothers."29 Insofar as early Japanese mechanical dolls seem to have been inspired by even earlier Chinese examples, the etymology of the term karakuri ningyõ is said to reflect this genealogy with the " kara " of karakuri phonetically connoting its Chinese origin or derivation. The development of karakuri ningyõ and their popularity peaked dur- ing the Edo period under the guidance of Takeda Õmi (d. 1727), who incor- porated and adapted clockwork technology, which had been recently im- ported from the West, and established the first mechanical puppet theater in the Dõtombori entertainment district of Osaka to compete with kabuki and ningyõ jõruri, Japans traditional puppet theater. Takeda specialized in karakuri ningyõ based on technology involving wooden cogwheel and string 230 STEVEN T. BROWN</page><page sequence="10">mechanisms, weight-driven mechanisms based on the displacement of sand, water, or mercury, and a new spring mechanism С zenmai ), which he had devel- oped, that was made out of whalebone. A wide range of karakuri ningyõ were developed for Takedas theater, including exhibits and performances that il- lustrated "the development of a fetus within the womb," "a neck-wrestling figure in which members of the audience were invited to match their strength against a life-sized mechanical doll, and calligraphy demonstrations based on the characters for plum,' cherry/ and pine,' in which a mechanical doll simultaneously executed these figures using a brush in both hands and his mouth/'30 In an effort to compete with kabuki and traditional puppet the- ater, the karakuri ningyõ displays became even more complex and spectacu- lar; however, this was not enough to prevent Takeda s karakuri ningyõ theater from being eclipsed by the more popular kabuki and ningyõ jõruri. What sharply distinguishes automata such as karakuri ningyõ from the dolls employed in the Japanese puppet theater is the former s mechanism of self-animation, their ability to move (or at least appear to move) by them- selves. Although especially complex karakuri tableaux sometimes required the employment of operators, the karakuri performances were more mechan- ically driven than puppeteer controlled. In contrast, the dolls of traditional Japanese puppet theater were animated, but they were not automated. It is this automation - the very mechanism denoted by the word " karakuri " - that also distinguishes automata from puppets in Ghost in the Shell 2. In the context of Ghost in the Shell 2, we see three types of karakuri ningyõ in action: (1) enormous dashi karakuri (parade float mechanical dolls) created for processional floats used in festival parades, such as the giant automated elephant and other large-scale creatures appearing in the religious festival witnessed by Batou and Togusa on their way to investigating Locus Solus, which were traditionally intended not only to entertain the gods but also to serve as vessels into which the gods were thought to descend; (2) much smaller zashiki karakuri (parlor mechanical dolls) produced for home use and enjoyment, such as the "tea-serving" karakuri ningyõ encountered in Kim s mansion; and (3) life-sized butai karakuri (stage mechanical dolls) designed for public performance, such as in Takeda Õmis theater. The figure of Kim, the professional hacker working for Locus Solus, as well as the automaton- like doubles of Togusa and Batou that are hallucinated by Togusa in Kims neo-baroque mansion, are reminiscent of the sort of life-sized mechanical dolls used in butai karakuri. Although all three types of karakuri ningyõ are relevant to the film's diegetic world, it is the last type that becomes the focus of Oshiť s engagements with the uncanny in Ghost in the Shell 2. M AC H I N I С DESIRES 231</page><page sequence="11">THE UNCANNY MANSION In Batou and Togusa s encounter with Kim in his surrealistic mansion, it is Kim s mechanical movements and gestures that make him more akin to a karakuri ningyõ than to an android or cyborg. This is not to say that androids are not also capable of inhuman movements lacking smooth transitions, but in the case of Kim, he is represented in a way that repeatedly evokes the automaton-like appearance and cogwheel-driven mechanisms of other kara- kuri ningyõ, such as the "tea-serving" (chahakobi ningyõ ) doll that also appears in Kims mansion. In her study of Edo-period aesthetics and culture, Mor- ishita Misako has suggested that it is the strangeness of karakuri movements that underscores their liminality: The karakuri puppet appears on the border where man and puppet make precarious contact. The figure of the [karakuri] puppet resembles the human figure. However, the moment that it starts to move, it reveals a decisive divergence from human movement; it makes rapid shifts difficult to capture with the naked eye, while simultaneously exposing its clumsiness. Each mo- ment that its naive movement is inscribed, the expected modes of everyday performance and standard narrative patterns are dislocated. This disillusion is compensated for by our attraction to the movements and changes which that strange body, distinct from the human body, enacts to a greater or lesser degree than normal.31 It is at this intersection between attraction and repulsion, between simulation of the human and its estrangement, between the organic and the mechanical, that Togusa and Batou encounter the uncanny in all its multifariousness. In the scenes that unfold at Kims mansion, the uncanny is evoked in four ways. First, the uncanny enters Kim s mansion in the form of déjà vu, a sense that something has happened before, of having seen or experienced some- thing before.32 Each feedback loop in which Batou and Togusa find them- selves caught, as they are compelled to repeat their tour of Kims mansion again and again and again, produces the repetition associated with déjà vu. Such repetition has the effect of evoking uncertainty as to which realities are truly real and which are simulacra - uncertainty that is further heightened by the numerous trompe l'oeil paintings and holographs found throughout Kim s mansion.33 It is only with the help of Batous guardian angel, Kusanagi, who functions on more than one occasion as a sort of deus ex machina, that Batou is finally able to discern the illusoriness of the déjà vu experience. 232 STEVEN T. BROWN</page><page sequence="12">The second way the uncanny becomes an issue is in terms of the blurring of boundaries between life and death evoked by the confusion as to whether Kim is dead or alive in his study.34 Not only Batous reflections on the myth of the Golem, as prompted by Kusanagis holographic messages concerning the Hebrew words for "truth" ( aemaeth ) and "death" ( maeth ), but also Kim s own philosophical meditations are relevant here. "The doubt," asserts Kim in a guise that makes him look like an automaton version of Togusa, "is whether a creature that certainly appears to be alive, really is." Alternatively, the doubt that a lifeless object might actually live. That's why dolls haunt us. They are modeled on humans. They are, in fact, nothing but human. They make us face the terror of being reduced to simple mecha- nisms and matter. In other words, the fear that, fundamentally, all humans belong to the void. Kims mode of embodiment provokes such boundary confusion precisely in- sofar as he is an automaton, which brings us to the third form of the uncanny. Although Freud suggests that the uncanny may be summoned when "what is human is perceived as merely mechanical," such as in the case of epileptic fits, sleepwalking, and other trance-like states, the opposite is also true: au- . tomata are also potentially uncanny because "what is perceived as human is in fact mechanical."35 In his dialogue with Batou, Kim (still wearing the guise of the automaton-like Togusa) offers an explanation for why this confusion between human and machine especially resonates with this era: In this age, the twin technologies of robotics and electronic neurology resurrected the eighteenth-century theory of man as machine. And now that computers have enabled externalized memory, humans have pursued self-mechanization aggressively, to expand the limits of their own func- tions. Determined to leave behind Darwinian natural selection, this human determination to beat evolutionary odds also reveals the very quest for per- fection that gave it birth. The mirage of life equipped with perfect hardware engendered this nightmare. After Kim offers this explanation, Batous head turns toward Togusa with a clicking sound and opens up to reveal the sort of mechanisms that were first shown in the opening scene when a gynoid attempted to commit suicide in an alleyway after murdering her owner and two police officers. In Kim s mansion, after Togusa reacts with horror to the mechanization of Batou, the M AC H I N I С DESIRES 233</page><page sequence="13">feedback loop begins again with another scene of déjà vu. This brings us to the fourth form of the uncanny: the doppelgänger or double. In the last instance of déjà vu, the structure of repetition enters into the scene of the uncanny in the form of the doppelgänger as Togusa has night- marish visions that both he himself and Batou have automata doubles. Even more horrifying, after the appearance of the automaton double of Togusa, whose voice was that of Kim, in the next sequence the automaton double of Batou is substituted for Kim. After these multiple scenes of doubling, To- gusa, hallucinating that he has been injured by an attack on Kim s mansion launched by the offshore factory ship of Locus Solus, witnesses his chest burst open to reveal that he himself is an automaton with a metal rib cage. As Mi- chael Bennett and Nicholas Royle have argued, "The double is paradoxically both a promise of immortality (look, theres my double, I can be reproduced, I can live forever) and a harbinger of death (look, there I am, no longer me here, but there: I am about to die, or else I must be dead already)."36 Although Kim sought perfection and immortality by transferring his consciousness to an automaton-like shell, the proliferation of doubles - Kims double, Togusas double, Batou's double - ends up undermining the very logic of identity.37 Each instance of the uncanny that unfolds at Kim s mansion (the repeti- tion of déjà vu, the blurring of boundaries between life and death, animate and inanimate, and the doppelgänger) evokes a feeling of unhomeliness in the home, a defamiliarization of the everyday that destabilizes our assump- tions about what it means to be human in a posthuman world and how we are to relate to all the ningyõ (dolls, puppets, automata, and androids) that inhabit the world with us. It is to the last type of uncanny ningyõ - referred to as "gynoids" in Ghost in the Shell 2 - and their relationship to the work of Hans Bellmer that I now turn. THE DOLLS OF HfiNS BELLMER Oshii has made it very clear in his production notes to Ghost in the Shell 2 and related interviews that his conception of the gynoid owes much to the work of Hans Bellmer, whose female dolls are referenced both visually and nar- rativally throughout the film. According to the production notes, Oshii "has wanted to explore the theme of dolls" for thirty years, since he first "fell in love" as a student "with photographs of Hans Bellmers ball-jointed doll."38 Bellmer s influence can be seen throughout the film, from the design of the gynoids themselves to recreations of specific poses from Bellmers art. In the 234 STEVEN T. BROWN</page><page sequence="14">remainder of my essay, I explore the significance of Bellmer s work, review some of the relevant scenes from Ghost in the Shell 2 in which Bellmers work is clearly cited, and then discuss how Oshn s gynoids reiterate issues raised by Bellmer in relation to the question of machinic desire. Hans Bellmer constructed his first life-sized female doll (which he dubbed "Die Puppe" - German for "doll" or "puppet") in 1933 out of papier-mâché and plaster covering a framework made of wood and metal. Bellmer stated his goals for the doll as follows: "I am going to construct an artificial girl with anatomical possibilities which are capable of re-creating the heights of pas- sion, even of inventing new desires."39 This doll was the subject of Bellmer s first book of photographs also entitled The Doll ( Die Puppe), published pri- vately in Germany in 1934, featuring ten black-and-white photographs of the doll situated in a variety of tableaux.40 These photos, along with eight ad- ditional, were then published at the end of the year in the sixth issue of the famous Surrealist magazine Minotaure with the following header: "Doll. Hans Bellmer, variations on the assembling of an articulated female minor."41 Perhaps borne out of his frustration with the limited range of movement of the first doll, Bellmer created a second female doll (which he called "La Poupée" - French for "doll" or "puppet"), fabricated in 1935 out of glue and tissue paper painted to resemble flesh over a structure of "wooden ball joints and appendages pivoting around a central ball joint."42 "Inspired by a pair of sixteenth-century articulated wooden dolls in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum," according to specialist Sue Taylor, Bellmer "produced a spherical belly for the new doll, around which could be arranged a number of parts in various combinations: four legs, four round stylized breasts, an upper torso, three pelvises, a pair of arms, and the recycled head and hand from the first doll."43 This second doll was the subject of over one hundred photographs taken be- tween 1935 and 1938, many of them hand-colored with monochromatic yel- low, green, blue, or pink, or combinations of fluorescent colors. The gender politics associated with Bellmers dolls are complicated to say the least. Therese Lichtenstein and others have critiqued Bellmer s dolls for "linking his fantasies of adolescent girls as passive victim and powerful seduc- tress with the themes of nostalgia and eroticism, and t[ying] his work to the French Surrealists' ambivalent desire for and revulsion at the female body."44 Although stopping short of confirming Lichtenstein s conclusion about "revul- sion at the female body," in his essay "Memories of the Doll Theme," which is a revised version of the foreword to his book The Doll, Bellmer does admit to the importance of masculine fantasy in the creation of the doll: "And didn't the doll, which lived solely through the thoughts projected into it, and which despite its MACHINIC DESIRES 235</page><page sequence="15">unlimited pliancy could be maddeningly stand-offish, didn't the very creation of its dollishness contain the desire and intensity sought in it by the imagi- nation?"45 And yet, such gender politics are also complicated by the fact that Bellmer views the dolls as exposing the foundations of such embodied fanta- sies and bringing to light the "anatomy of the physical unconscious" (anatomie de l'inconscient physique), as he referred to it.46 To illustrate the mechanisms of interiority and their link to exteriority, Bellmer conceived of a doll with a rotat- ing panorama mechanism installed in its stomach, an illustration of which was included in the publication of his book The Doll. By pressing the button located in the dolls left breast,47 the panorama was set into motion and one could gaze upon a jumble of "small objects, different materials and colour pictures in bad taste," which were supposed to display "a girl's thoughts and dreams,"48 but which more likely displayed what the artist projected onto them. Bellmer s practice of reconfiguring the doll in grotesque ways, includ- ing doubling and multiplying sections of the doll to create what he acknowl- edged were "monstrous" additions - "a second pair of legs and arms, another torso with four breasts,"49 and so forth - pushed the limits of what might be construed as human through a grammar of infinite combination and re- combination. "I am talking about the possibilities of decomposing and then recomposing the body and its limbs against nature,"' wrote Bellmer in his unpublished notes from January of 1946. 50 What Bellmer was attempting to do with his doll experiments was to construct corporeal anagrams: "The body resembles a sentence," wrote Bellmer, "that seems to invite us to dismantle it into its component letters, so that its true meanings may be revealed ever anew through an endless stream of anagrams."51 Although Bellmer 's dolls are not functioning automata, their quasi- mechanical internal workings, which are frequently exposed, seem designed to underscore their resemblance to automata.52 As art historians Therese Lich- tenstein and Sidra Stich have remarked, insofar as "the entire body could be assembled and reassembled like a machine,"53 Bellmer 's dolls seem to embody the Surrealist "nightmare of mechanization"54 that haunted many artists in the wake of the First World War.55 And like the automaton Olympia in E. T. A. Hoffman's short story "The Sandman," which had a significant impact on Bellmer, the dolls evoke the uncanny in their blurring of boundaries between the living and the dead, the animate and the inanimate. Whether in relation to the panorama mechanism contained in the belly of the first doll or the me- chanical mobility of the ball joint utilized in the second doll, which Bellmer considered "a perfect cog around which endless bodily contortions could pivot and out of which he devised a vast operating system," 56 the uncanny automaton 236 STEVEN T. BROWN</page><page sequence="16">is central to an understanding of Bellmers art. All of the concepts that he employs to describe his work - such as "anatomy of the image" (anatomie de l'image) y "anatomy of the physical unconscious" ( anatomie de l'inconscient physique ), and "anatomy of love" (anatomie de l'amour)57 - emphasize the WHAT &amp;EU-MER WAS ATTEMPTING TO VO WITH HI S POU- EXPERIMENTS WAS TO CONSTRUCT CORPOREAS ANAGRAMS. 1 ^ machinic links between interiority and exteriority that are part and parcel of Bellmers ongoing attempts to make visible the "desire apparatus" of our unconscious with its mechanisms, both real and virtual.58 The crime "against nature" that Bellmer enthusiastically choreographed in the erotic scénographies of his doll photos was perpetrated not against actual human beings but rather against the fascistic conception of beauty and the perfect body proffered by National Socialist ideologues. After Hitler came to power on January 30, 1933, Bellmer was determined "to avoid any work that might in any way be of service to the state."59 Bellmer writes that what he was doing was "a gesture of rejection of German fascism and the prospect of war: cessation of all socially useful activity."60 As Michael Semff and Anthony Spira have suggested, Bellmer employed the doll "as a powerful tool for social critique, and a violent attack on stereotypes and the promotion of an idealised Aryan race."61 By photographing his dolls in a way that under- scored their grotesque and uncanny aspects, Bellmer offered acts of artistic resistance against the Nazi regime and its cult of the perfect body. Although Bellmer s art was not singled out for the Nazi-sponsored exhibition on "De- generate Art" ("Entartete Kunst"), which opened in Munich in 1937 before traveling to Berlin in 1938, 62 nevertheless, Bellmer was well aware that his style of art and its subject matter were highly transgressive and that he was becoming "increasingly isolated"63 in Germany in the current political atmo- sphere. Therefore, in March of 1938, Bellmer fled Berlin for Paris with a host of other German artists and intellectuals. BELLMER/OSHII Bellmers influence can be seen throughout Ghost in the Shell 2. Every scene in which a ball-jointed gynoid appears may be construed as a reference to and remediation of Bellmers doll photos. Among the strongest citations are images from the manufacturing scene in the opening credits, which shows us the assembly and doubling of the gynoid s ball-jointed body (see Figures 2 and 3). MACHINIC DESIRES 237</page><page sequence="17">figure 2. The assembly of a ball-jointed gynoid. Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence. figure 3. The doubling of the gynoid's body. Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence. When manipulating and deforming the integrity of the body, Bellmer had many tools at his disposal, including anatomical division, subtraction, addition, and multiplication (see Figure 4). 64 By utilizing two of those tech- niques, division and multiplication, the opening credits of Ghost in the Shell 2 offer a poignant remediation of Bellmers corporeal anagrams in the service of posthuman capitalism and its fetishistic obsession with what Walter Ben- jamin has described as "the sex appeal of the inorganic."65 Perhaps the most significant scene for understanding Oshii's remedia- tion of Bellmer occurs at the films outset when Batou comes face-to-face in a dark alley with a gynoid, who has just murdered her owner and two police 238 STEVEN T. BROWN</page><page sequence="18">officers. The gynoid repeatedly asks for help before tearing open her chest with her own hands in an ap- parent suicide attempt and is then dispatched with multiple shotgun blasts by Batou. As Oshii confirms in his production notes,66 this scene of self-mutilation is a direct citation of an illustration by Bellmer entitled Rose ouverte la nuit (Rose open at night) from 1934 (see Figure 5), pro- duced contemporaneously with his doll photos. In addition to being a photographer, it is worth noting that Bellmer created numerous drawings, paintings, etchings, and sculptures figure 4. Hans Bellmer, Lo Poupee (1938). Copyright 2007 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/ADAGP, Paris. "in an obsessive quest for a monstrous dictionary/" as he called it, "dedicated to the ambivalence of the body."67 Rather than pigeonholing Bellmer as a Sur- realist photographer, it is probably more apt, as Michael Semff and Anthony Spira have suggested, to describe him as "an anatomist, an engineer, even a geographer or cartographer of the body."68 Executed in pencil and white gouache on paper, Rose ouverte la nuit is considered by many Bellmer schol- ars to be "the most overtly transgressive" of all the monochrome drawings from this period, since the girl exposes her "internal organs and . . . ushers in the theme of 'undressing' - of interiority."69 A number of Bellmer s doll figure 5. Closeup of Hans Bellmer, Rose ouverte lo nuit (1934). Copyright 2007 Artists Rights Soci- ety (ARS), New York/ADAGP, Paris. photos reveal a similar interest in the disclosure of the doll s interior spaces and mechanisms. As I have already suggested in my discussion of his "anatomy of the physical un- conscious," Bellmer was intensely interested in the reversibility of inside and outside, in turning the inside out and the outside in.70 Standing in sharp contrast to the grotesque scene depicted in Rose ouverte la nuit is the delicate ornamental pattern appearing to the left of the girl, "undulating M AC H I N I С DESIRES 239</page><page sequence="19">like a lacy curtain."71 As is the case in other works by Bellmer, the interlaced pattern in Rose ouverte la nuit visualizes pulsating lines of energy, tension, and desire as emitted from the girls body. In comparing Oshii's gynoid with Bellmer s self-rending girl, it is noteworthy that the gynoid also wears a simi- larly impassive look on her face even as she tears open the skin on her torso and reveals the rib cage and machinic innards beneath (see Figure 6) - an ex- pression that the gynoid also shares with the wax anatomical figures modeled after actual corpses that Oshii studied during preproduction at La Specola in Italy, which have sometimes been compared to Bellmer s work.72 The brick wall behind the gynoid, whose distorted lines are the result of the gynoid s impact against the wall during her combat with Batou, ap- pear to undulate in the low-key lighting much like the lines of energy, ten- sion, and desire emitted from the girls body in Rose ouverte la nuit. However, whereas Bellmer s self-rending girl peers into the interior spaces of her abdo- men, Oshii's gynoid looks directly at the camera at the precise moment of self-mutilation, appealing not only to Batou for help but also to the audi- ence. Moreover, just as Bellmer s dolls, many of which reveal a similar inter- est in and disclosure of the bodys interior spaces and mechanisms, function as an artistic protest against the Nazi regimes cult of youth and the perfect body, so too the scene of gynoid self-mutilation at the outset of Ghost in the figure 6. A gynoid attempting suicide. Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence. 240 STEVEN T. BROWN</page><page sequence="20">Shell 2 seems to function as an act of resistance against the ideal of beauty to which the kidnapped adolescent girls are being held captive. The gynoids engage in acts of destruction and self-mutilation in order to draw attention to the plight and exploitation of adolescent girls who have been kidnapped by the Kõjinkai gang and supplied to Locus Solus for the purpose of "ghost- dubbing" - a process by which the mind or spirit of a human is transferred to a gynoid in order to make it more "desirable." The key to understanding this scene and others that follow is a detail that appears in the crime scene where Jack Volkerson, the shipping inspector for Locus Solus, was gruesomely murdered. During the course of investiga- tion, Batou comes across a copy of Bellmer s book The Doll (see Figure 7), into which a holographic photo of an adolescent girl had been inserted. What we are shown in this scene is the front cover of a Japanese edition of The Doll , which was first published in 1995, featuring one of the hand-colored photos of Bellmers ball-jointed doll.73 That the camera dwells on the cover of the book long enough to make out the title and even the author s name leaves no doubt that Bellmer s work is crucial to an understanding of Ghost in the Shell 2. But it is what is inside the book that provides the most important clue to the significance of Bellmer s work to the film as a whole. As Batou looks through the book, he comes upon figure 7. Batou holds a copy of Hans Bellmer's The Doll. Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence. M AC H I N I С DESIRES 241</page><page sequence="21">a holographic photo of an adolescent girl, which he studies at the crime scene and then again at his house. By situating the holographic image of the miss- ing girl inside the book of The Doll by Bellmer, Oshii provides us with a visual metaphor that anticipates Batou's eventual discovery of the kidnapped girls being held captive by Locus Solus for the purpose of ghost-dubbing. In effect, just as Bellmer s book on artificial dolls contains the simulacrum of the cap- tive girl inside of it, so too, the Locus Solus gynoids have been instilled with the simulacrum of the adolescent girls held captive. In this way, the revers- ibility of inside and outside that so deeply interested Bellmer is reenvisioned by Oshii as a critique of the anthropomorphization of gynoids and other ro- bots.74 Why is it necessary to make robots in our own image? Is it possible to coexist with forms of artificial intelligence without forcing them into the human mold? These are the sort of questions raised by Ghost in the Shell 2 during the course of the animes engagement with uncanny ningyõ. However, Oshii does not stop there. Just as important as the critique of the anthropomorphization of robots is a questioning of the human as such. As Coroner Haraway (a character named after Donna Haraway, author of the famed "Cyborg Manifesto"75) remarks, in a scene that features disassembled and suspended gynoids that strongly resemble Bellmer s doll photos, especially those showing dolls that are hanging in mid-air from a door frame or tree, The dolls that little girls mother are not surrogates for real babies. Little girls aren't so much imitating child rearing, as they are experiencing some- thing deeply akin to child rearing. . . . Raising children is the simplest way to achieve the ancient dream of artificial life. It is not only that dolls or gynoids are modeled after humans, it is that hu- mans model themselves after the ideals embodied by artificial dolls such as gynoids. In other words, what we consider "human" is not simply a natural phenomenon but a complex sociocultural and philosophical construction. In response to Haraway s philosophizing, Togusa exclaims in protest: "Children aren't dolls!" However, Batou acknowledges Haraway s point by remarking that "Descartes didn't differentiate man from machine, animate from inani- mate. He lost his beloved five-year-old daughter and then named a doll after her, Francine." Descartes doted on the doll named Francine as if it were his own daughter. Oshii not only blurs the boundaries between human and ma- chine, animate and inanimate in order to evoke the uncanny, he also shows us the chiasmic intertwinement between the human and the machinic - the machinic in the human and the human in the machine. 242 STEVEN T. BROWN</page><page sequence="22">In the penultimate shot of the film, Oshii brings to the fore the machinic nature of the human by showing Togusas daughter happily embracing the blonde-and-blue-eyed doll that she has just received as a gift from her father. This simple image of a girl hugging her doll resonates with new meanings in the wake of all that has preceded, suggesting that, at the very least, it should be reinterpreted as constituting not merely an imitation of human rearing but more pointedly a circuit of relations - i.e., a machine - connecting hu- mans and artificial figures made to look human in a relationship of coexis- tence that modifies each other in unforeseen ways. As Oshii has remarked in interviews, "to ask what the difference is between an adult raising a child and a girl playing with her doll" is "not an immoral question, nor does it indicate some kind of regression." Rather, it is quite simply "the only way we can un- derstand the nature of human existence."76 In the end, Ghost in the Shell 2 offers something more profound than sim- ply another lesson in compassionate humanism, since it places into question the very foundation of humanism itself. When the cybernetically enhanced human subject looks into the mirror in Ghost in the Shell 2, what it sees is nothing more or less than what it has already projected as human. In other words, at the limits of the human, Batou discovers that human nature is it- self synthetic - human "nature" is itself an artificial construct and desiring- machine.77 As Togusa remarks to Batou in the elevator on the way to Coroner Haraway s lab, quoting Meiji-period satirist Saitõ Ryokuu (1867-1904): "The mirror is not a tool of enlightenment, it is a tool of illusion [kagami wa set- tori no gu ni arazu, mayoi no gu nari'."7S However, in the midst of demystify- ing such anthropocentric illusions and projections, just as it seems that, as philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche argues, "the human intellect cannot avoid seeing itself in its own perspectives, and only in these," since "we cannot look around our own corner,"79 Oshii suggests a way outside of ourselves that is not conceived metaphysically in terms of transcendence but rather in terms of the "innocence" of becoming-animal. ON THE INNOCENCE OF DOLLS, ANGELS, AND BECOMING- ANIMAL Although the anime is known internationally as Ghost in the Shell 2: Inno- cence, in Japan it was originally released as simply Inosensu, the Japanese phoneticization of the English word "innocence." Oshii' s stress on the word "innocence" begs the question as to whom or what the word applies in the MACHINIC DESIRES 243</page><page sequence="23">film. During a discussion held at the Japanese premiere of Ghost in the Shell 2, Oshii offered the following reflections on the problem of innocence in rela- tion to humans and dolls: What would it mean for a human to "become more than human"? One an- swer would be to discard the actual human body, and embrace becoming a doll. People try to adjust their natural bodies, evolved for something very different, to the modern urban environment. Instead of following that tra- jectory, we're better off turning into dolls, into intended artifice.80 In a sense, this is what happens when the adolescent girls are ghost-hacked in order to breathe life into the gynoids by making them more animated and de- sirable, metaphorically transforming the girls into dolls themselves. However, Oshii goes to great lengths to undercut the innocence of the young women. Even as the self-destructing gynoids demystify the cultural constructedness (and artificiality) of the ideal of beauty in which the figure of the adolescent girl is quite literally trapped, Ghost in the Shell 2 underscores the complicity of young women in the construction and perpetuation of such ideals. Although the girl released by Batou and Kusanagi proclaims loudly that she "didn't want to become a doll," Kusanagi criticizes the girls self-pity, saying that "if the dolls could speak, no doubt they'd scream: 'I didn't want to become hu- man/" In other words, the girl-gynoid interface evokes the loss of innocence rather than its positive assertion. If innocence is to be found here, it is not in "WHAT W OUU? IT MEAN FOR A HÜMAM TO 'BECOME MORE THAM HUMAN3? ONE ANSWER WOUU? BE TO PISCARP THE ACTUAL HUMAN ВОРУ, ANP EMBRACE ВВСОМЫ6 A POUU" 4/ 1 the adolescent girls but rather in the gynoids before they have been imprinted by the girls. As suggested by science fiction writer Ya- mada Masaki, who wrote the prequel novel- ization to Ghost in the Shell 2, entitled Inno- cence: After the Long Goodbye : "an empty doll is much more innocent than people attached to the illusion of 'human-ness.'"81 On another level, innocence may be sug- gested by Batou s ethereal relationship with his "guardian angel," Kusanagi, who exists largely in cyberspace after merging with the Puppet Master at the end of the first movie. In his discussion with Oshii at Ghost in the Shell 2s premiere, Yamada Masaki offered the following interpretation: The reason Batou goes into enemy territory isn't really because he wants to rescue someone, nor is it really because he wants to solve the case. He just 244 STEVEN T. BROWN</page><page sequence="24">wants to meet his angel, Mo toko. It doesn't really matter whether their re- lationship is a conventional romance or not. You see, their love might seem cold to humans, but what is between them is no longer human, and now very innocent.82 However, what is all too often lost in discussions of the innocence of Batous relationship with Kusanagi is the significance of Kusanagis name, which is rich with cultural connotations in Japanese history and mythology. Accord- ing to Japanese mythology, the Kusanagi Sword (or Kusanagi no Tsurugi) was one of the legendary imperial treasures once given as a gift to the warrior Yamato Takeru to help him defeat his enemies - a weapon comparable in im- portance to the sword Excalibur in the history of Britain. It was thought that any warrior who brandished the Kusanagi Sword could defeat an entire army. It is said that in one particular battle, when he was trapped in an expanse of grassland ignited by his enemy, Yamato Takeru employed the sword both to cut the grass and control the direction of the wind, thereby protecting him- self and blowing the grass fire toward his enemy, who was soon vanquished. To commemorate his victory, Yamato Takeru renamed the sword "Kusanagi," which means "grasscutter."83 In the context of Ghost in the Shell 2, as soon as Batou has gained access to the production area for Hadaly-model gynoids, an army of gynoids is released to seize the intruder. Batou initially keeps the gynoids at bay but is soon out- numbered. Suddenly, Batous guardian angel, Kusanagi, downloads herself into one of the gynoids in order to protect Batou and assist him in defeating the gynoid army. In this sense, however innocent Batous relationship to Kusanagi may seem, by turning Kusanagi into a weapon for Batous protection, her char- acter is reduced to little more than a supplement to aid him in defeating the army of gynoids. Indeed, even Kusanagi remarks on the limitations placed on her agency and powers of expression when downloaded into the body of a gy- noid: "To be precise, its just a fragment of me downloaded via satellite. This gynoids e-brain lacks capacity. It can only handle the combat robotics control system. This is the best I can do for facial and vocal expression." As soon as she has fulfilled her mission, Kusanagi disappears again into the ether of cy- berspace, leaving the viewer to wonder if this representation of the vanishing woman with its erasure of the female body is really so innocent after all.84 However, there is one more example of innocence, and it is one that Oshii has raised repeatedly in interviews about Ghost in the Shell 2. In response to the question that was considered earlier - "What would it mean for a human to 'become more than human?" - Oshii offers a second possible answer: M AC H I N I С DESIRES 245</page><page sequence="25">Another option is to communicate with dogs. Once you discard anthrocen- trism, you have to take animals into consideration. Dogs provide a much better contrast against robots or dolls than humans do. . . . Dogs became unique creatures by interacting and living with humans. ... By communicat- ing with dogs, I thought humans might realize something about themselves. So I wanted to contrast humans against dogs, rather than simply against artificial intelligence.85 Oshii is well known for inserting cameos of his beloved basset hound "Gabriel" in most of his anime and a few of his live-action films, but Ghost in the Shell 2 provides the most extended homage to basset hounds thus far. In addition to modeling the animated basset hound after the likeness of the real Gabriel, Oshii recorded his dogs barks and other sounds for added authenticity. From Batous affectionate relationship with his dog to the basset hound posters and imagery sprinkled throughout the film (including a mechanical basset hound in the likeness of Gabriel at Batous house and images of a basset on the spin- ning globe inside Kims mansion), the dog motif plays a significant role in Ghost in the Shell 2. 86 Indeed, the importance of dogs is signaled in the very first scene when we are shown a neon sign situated on top of a large skyscraper displaying the Chinese character for small dog or puppy. Likewise, in the last scene of the film, after we see Togusa hug his daughter and his daughter hug the new doll that he has just given to her as an omiyage, the camera cuts to a close-up of the dolls face, followed by a head-and-shoulders close-up shot of Batou hugging his dog with city skyscrapers looming in the distance. Batou s basset hound emits a low murmur and stares pensively at the girl and her new doll, while Batou looks directly at the camera through his opaque cyborg eyes. Insofar as the dog motif appears in both the first and last shots of the film, it effectively enframes the film as a whole, underscoring the importance of the dog to Ghost in the Shell 2. To understand why Oshii has "gone to the dogs," it helps to consider the concept of "becoming-animal" elaborated by philoso- phers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus.87 Rather than reduce the animal to "a representative of the drives, or a rep- resentation of the parents," which is, according to Deleuze and Guattari, what psychoanalysis does every time it encounters the question of the becoming- animal in humans, Ghost in the Shell 2 shows us a cybernetic human (Batou) who is becoming-animal by entering into composition with a dog, thereby forming a new assemblage with one another, an assemblage in which rela- tions of movement and rest, speed and slowness, as well as zones of prox- imity and intensity, are shared. Batous becoming-animal does not involve 246 STEVEN T. BROWN</page><page sequence="26">imitation of his dog - he does not try to represent the dog as human; rather, he enters into composition with it, thereby releasing nonhuman possibilities into the human "outside the programmed body."88 Becoming-animal is not simply the reproduction of an animal image, much less the metamorphosis into that animal, but rather a deterritorialization of the human and the ani- mal, in which both the human and animal become something else - involving new intensities, affects, speeds, and modes of being - as a result of the new assemblage formed by their circuit of relations, such that it becomes "impos- sible to say where the boundary between the human and animal lies."89 At the very end of Ghost in the Shell 2, as Batou and his basset appear in the last shot in a mutual embrace, the becoming-animal of Batou approaches cyborg theorist Donna Haraway s reflections on "companion species" as an at- tempt to find "non-anthropomorphic ways" to conceive of agencies and actors and the coevolutionary networks that constitute them.90 It is not simply, as Lisa Bode argues, that "the unconditional love and animal innocence of our pets is one of the few things that keeps us from becoming truly dehumanised while living and working in dehumanising systems."91 Rather, it is that as we enter into coevolutionary networks with dogs, as we learn to coexist with nonhuman entities in the most intimate of spaces - our homes - we are al- tered by dogs as much as dogs are altered by us. In the end, Oshii suggests that our relations with dogs may be a possible way out of our anthropocentric obsession with uncanny ningyõ, a way outside of ourselves. As Deleuze and Guattari put it: "There is no longer man or animal, since each deterritorializes the other, in a conjunction of flux, in a continuum of reversible intensities."92 Notes The author wishes to thank Daisuke Miyao, Tom Looser, Gerald Figal, and Paul Young for their constructive feedback. 1.

"Remediation" is defined by media theorists Jay David Bolter and Richard Gruisin as follows: "It is that which appropriates the techniques, forms, and social significance of other media and attempts to rival or refashion them in the name of the real." I would qualify this definition by revising the last part: acts of remediation are performed not only in the name of "the real" but may just as well be performed in the name of "literary or aesthetic value," "cultural or political authority," "beauty," as well as "pleasure" and "enter- tainment." Indeed, the functions of remediation are probably as diverse as the audiences of remediation.

The murders are committed by a "Hadaly-model" gynoid. The name "Hadaly" invokes not only the female android of the same name that appears in the nineteenth- century science fiction novel L'Eve future ( Future Eve, 1886) by French symbolist writer Auguste Villiers de l'lsle-Adam (1838-1889), who first coined the word "android" and whose work is quoted in the epigraph at the outset of Ghost in the Shell 2, but also the humanoid robot with the same name developed in 1995 at the Humanoid Robotics Institute at Waseda University in Tokyo to investigate human-robot interaction and com- munication, which had the capability to speak and listen in Japanese and make meaningful gestures with its arms in order to give directions. Incidentally, Hans Bellmer also cited L'Ève future as a minor influence on his work.

Whereas limited animation was first adopted as a way to cut corners on a tight budget, Oshii pushes the complexity of contemporary animation (and the animators whom he employs) to the limit in scenes such as this, which reportedly required two-to-three thousand background drawings. 12.

The name of the gynoid manufacturing company, "Locus Solus," is a reference to the 1914 French novel of the same name by Raymond Roussel. Canterei, the protagonist of Roussel's Locus Solus, resembles the hacker Kim in Ghost in the Shell 2 not only with re- spect to the surrealistic country estate he occupies, which contains all manner of strange sights (including reanimated corpses), but also insofar as he orchestrates numerous scenes of repetition, causing the dead to reenact the most important events of their lives again and again in a perpetual cycle of déjà vu. See Raymond Roussel, Locus Solus, trans. Rupert Copeland Cunningham (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1970); and Mark Ford, Raymond Roussel and the Republic of Dreams (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell Univer- sity Press, 2000), 121-50. 33. A number of the surrealistic scenes in Kim's mansion were inspired by the work of American photographers Jerry Uelsmann and Arthur Tress. According to the directors annotations to the storyboards for Ghost in the Shell 2, Oshii consulted the following col- lections by Uelsmann: Uelsmann: Process and Perception (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 1985), Jerry Uelsmann: Photo Synthesis (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 1992), and Uelsmann/Yosemite (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 1996). On the pho- tography of Arthur Tress, see Richard Lorenz, Arthur Tress : Fantastic Voyage: Photographs 1956-2000 (Boston: Little, Brown, 2001). 34. Here it is worth noting that the character design for Kim was inspired by the work of artist Yotsuya Shimon (commonly known as Yotsuya Simon), particularly his life- sized, ball-jointed dolls (see especially a work entitled "Man" from 2000). Since Yotsuyas dolls frequently blur the boundary between the living and the dead, the human and the mechanical, it is easy to see why his work lent itself to Oshii's vision in Ghost in the Shell 2. Indeed, Oshii was so taken by Yotsuyas work and its resemblance to the dolls of Hans Bellmer, who is also one of Yotsuyas principal inspirations, that he collaborated with Yot- suya on an Oshii-supervised exhibition entitled "Dolls of Innocence," which was held at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo from February 7 through March 21, 2004. The exhibit included many disturbing works of doll-related art by artists including Yotsuya, Bellmer, Akiyama Mahoko, Igeta Hiroko, Amano Katan, and Miura Etsuko.

During preproduction research, Oshii made a special trip, which is said to have had "a profound impact on his vision for Ghost in the Shell 2," to the International Center of Photography in New York to study a special exhibition of Bellmer's doll photos.

Instead, it concludes that all forms of life - humans, animals, and robots - are equal. . . . What we need today is not some kind of anthropocentric humanism. Humanity has reached its limits." 75.

Al- though some of the gynoids in Ghost in the Shell 2, particularly those without hair that are suspended in Coroner Haraway 's lab, seem to bear more than a passing resemblance to the amorous androids made famous in Björk's acclaimed 1999 music video "All Is Full of Love" (dir. Chris Cunningham), Oshii has indicated that the gynoids were inspired by the work of Hans Bellmer and Yotsuya Simon.
