      <p>Gloria Davies’ <italic>Lu Xun’s Revolution: Writing in a Time of Violence</italic> targets the hagiography that has long obscured Lu Xun’s crucial intervention in China’s linguistic and literary modernity, and re-situates him in concrete historical settings of discursive struggle and ideological contestation. The purpose of Davies’ inquiry is to interrogate the state-funded discipline of “Lu Xun studies” or “Luxunology” in the People’s Republic of China, which she traces to the late 1930s and 1940s, when Mao Zedong first elevated the author posthumously to the status of “a Chinese sage of the first order” (p. 6). While Davies indicates that Lu Xun was mythicized as the “aura” or “spirit” of revolutionary fighting in Mao’s propaganda apparatus between the 1950s and 1970s, she also reminds us that the attempts in the post-Mao world to rectify this distorted picture are inadequate: Lu Xun continues to be enlisted in the service of Chinese intellectuals’ various agendas, generating an “excess of meaning” (p. 325) as distorting as that of the Maoist regime. Post-Mao intellectual discourse has both marginalized Lu Xun’s later writings and perpetuated a notion of humanism lacking struggle and history, which, Davies sharply points out, is precisely the sort of abstraction that Lu Xun challenged through his lifelong commitment to writing. Davies focuses her analysis on the later phase of Lu Xun’s career (1927–36), and in particular his polemical and miscellaneous essays which challenge both the ultra-politicization of the author in Mao’s time and the de-politicization of him in the post-Mao period. By skillfully combining the methods of biographical study, historical inquiry and literary analysis, Davies reveals Lu Xun’s humanism to be a mode of affective engagement and somatic struggle with language on the solid and changing grounds of history.</p>
      <p>While at times readers may find Davies’ writing style repetitive, she parses Lu Xun’s essays astutely, and lucidly explains why he threw himself into factional polemics and conflicts in the tumultuous environment of intra-national political intrigues. From this rigorous contextualization, Davies furthers the well-illustrated argument that Lu Xun articulated an original, linguistically oriented approach to humanism, one that cannot be understood in terms of a cogent system of philosophical thoughts but only in relation to his visceral experience with language as he engaged in fraught debates with his protégés, intellectual companions and interlocutors.</p>
      <p>Chapter 1, “Eyes Wide Open”, examines Lu Xun’s critique of the revolutionary tutelage in Guangzhou imposed by the Nationalist Party during the Northern Expedition; Chapter 2, “The Shanghai Haze”, illustrates how he was entangled in Shanghai’s cultural marketplace, from which he benefited as a writer but which he nonetheless censured for the degradation of the leftist discourse advocating “literature for the masses” (p. 94) and “revolutionary literature” (p. 95). These two chapters cogently explicate Lu Xun’s humanism as critical consciousness, in opposition to political dogma from the right and the left, as well as to situations in which political opportunism, commercialism and sensationalism were complicit in corrupting the intellectual discourse of the time. Chapter 3, “Guns and Words”, discusses how the idea of revolution as speedy change created a set of rhetorical ruses in the leftist discourse that sought to turn the “weapons of art (literature)” into an actual “art of weapons (guns)” (p. 121). Through revealing Lu Xun’s critique of aestheticized revolutionary slogans that came to corrupt the burgeoning <italic>baihua</italic> vernacular, this chapter also explains the political and historical context in which the author developed his thoughts about the belated and tragic arrival of true insight, as well as his acute sensitivity to the fatal gap between language and reality. In Chapter 4, “Debating Lu Xun”, Davies further investigates the ideological rectitude and demagogy of the left by analyzing the processes through which Lu Xun was increasingly emptied of his own voice and history by his opponents, as he was taken to task for compromising China’s revolution. This chapter also reveals the changing fates of Lu Xun’s adversaries under Maoist rule in the 1950s and 1960s, as he was posthumously sanctified as a revolutionary hero.</p>
      <p>Chapters 5 and 6 are the most insightful and enjoyable chapters of this book. Davies elaborates on Lu Xun’s experience with language through a close reading of his literary art <italic>qua</italic> art. Chapter 5, “Lu Xun’s Revolutionary Literature”, examines how he painfully traversed classical <italic>wenyan</italic> language and the <italic>baihua</italic> vernacular. By proposing the idea of “poetic anthropomorphism” (p. 253), this chapter offers a refreshing interpretation of themes, such as a summoning voice and cannibalism, in relation to the jogging of the <italic>baihua</italic> vernacular on the rough road of history. Chapter 6, “Raising Revolutionary Specters”, argues intriguingly that the ghostly spectacles in Lu Xun’s writings reveal a wider political desire for empathic, communal experience <italic>in</italic> language, which, Davies convincingly maintains, articulates the core value of Lu Xun’s humanism.</p>
      <p>While Davies does not aim to use Lu Xun’s life and writings to elaborate a new theory of language, history or politics, seeking instead to re-construct his creative processes and critical practice through a close reading of the texts, this method keeps her from fully articulating the theoretical stakes of her sharp insights in individual discussions. Nevertheless, this book has fulfilled its purpose of ridding Lu Xun of a solemnity suited to a saint or a great thinker, rather than a complex, historical figure tormented by intellectual responsibility and political engagement. This book is valuable not only for specialists in Lu Xun but also for readers interested in the history of modern and contemporary China, Chinese intellectual politics and literature.</p>
