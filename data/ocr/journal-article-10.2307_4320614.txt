<plain_text><page sequence="1">Moore on Right and Wrong The Normative Ethics of G.E. Moore by William H. Shaw, Dept. of Philosophy San Jose State University CA, USA G.E Moore's work shaped twentieth century ethics. But while his metaethical doctrines have seen decades of debate, little attention has been paid to his normative theory. Yet Moore broke fresh and important ground in elaborating an indirect, sophisticated, and non-hedon- istic form of utilitarianism. Moore on Right and Wrong is 1111111 a critical reconstruction and exposition of this neglected side of his ethical thought. It situates his normative ethics New with respect to traditional utilitarianism and assesses Publication Moore's case for consequentialism. The final chapters explore in detail the implications of Moore's theory for in- dividual moral conduct - in particular, his denial of self- evident moral rules; his skepticism about knowledge of one's duty; his attempt to establish the validity of certain moral rules; and his account of what moral agents should do in situations where such rules apply and in situations where they do not.

Nowadays, the term 'applied logic' has lIllI ll a very wide meaning, as numerous applications of logical l methods in computer science, formal linguistics and other fields testify. Such applications are by no means restricted New to the use of known logical techniques: at its best, applied P blicaty t logic involves a back-and-forth dialogue between logical Ubication theory and the problem domain. The papers focus on the application of logic to the study of natural language, in syntax, semantics and pragmatics, and the effect of these studies on the development of logic. In the last decade, the dynamic nature of natural language has been the most interesting challenge for logi- cians. Dynamic semantics is here applied to new topics, the dynamic approach is extended to syntax, and several methodological issues in dynamic semantics are system- atically investigated. Other methodological issues in the formal studies of natural language are discussed, such as the need for types, modal operators and other logical operators in the formal framework. Further articles address the scope of these methodological issues from other perspectives ranging from cognition to computation. The volume presents papers that are interesting for graduate students and researchers in the field of logic, philosophy of language, formal semantics and pragmatics, and computational linguistics.

'I ll The boundary shift between the 'natural' and the 'social' is becoming permanent: moves in either direction are subject to ideological rhetoric. Yet there is continual exchange N across the line: metaphors are moving freely between biol- ew ogy and the social sciences. As messengers of meaning Publication they become agents of change, forever undermining any attempt at fixing similarities and differences. Biology as Society Society as Biology: Metaphors offers a unique look at the function of metaphors in mediating be- tween two disciplinary cultures which represent and mold our views about nature and society, and the boundary be- tween them. For professionals and students of history, philosophy and sociology of science, biology, and literary science alike. Contents and Contributors Introduction: Is There a Bridge over Troubled Waters? S.

The book consists mainly of portraits of his early New teachers, most of whom belonged to a transitional Publication generation of immigrant Hebrew scholars - un- sung heroes of Jewish education on the American scene. Through the medium of such portraits of teaching personalities and styles, as well as first- hand descriptions of various educational settings in the New York City of the 30s and 40s, he com- ments on aspects of immigrant life, the tensions between religious and secular worlds, the psychol- ogy of learning and teaching the relations between universalism and particularism, the contrasts be- tween intensive education and instrumental schooling, and related themes. These themes, al- though exemplified in the details of his own ex- perience, are of quite general significance. The book will be of special interest for those con- cerned with Jewish life, with religious education, with the immigrant experience and with the recent American past. Contents Introduction.
