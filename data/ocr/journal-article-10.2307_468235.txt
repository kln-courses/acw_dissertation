<plain_text><page sequence="1">Counter-Chronicling and Alternative Mapping in Memoria delfuego and Almanac of the Dead Virginia E. Bell Georgetown University Recent definitions of nationalism amount to a charge that Euro- centric narratives of economic development and hierarchical racial classification accrue around the very idea of "nation." At the same time, descriptions of late twentieth-century global restructuring suggest that nation-states are less determining of lived realities than we might have been lead to believe. Both these claims raise questions about using nationalism as an anti-colonial or anti- imperial strategy for liberation: can one invent a nation and a national history without replicating the European model and its problematic consequences? Is nationalism useful in the face of what some call the "imperial" power of global corporations? (Bamet and Cavanagh 13-18). Yet the deployment of anti-colonial and anti-imperial nationalism in some cases constitutes a strategy of survival. U.S. American Indian communities' usage of the word "nations" to refer to political and kinship systems modified by colonial encounters (and not easily translated into English) and to assert sovereignty over reservation territory is a strategic disman- tling of the cultural symbols of U.S. nationalism and state control. Indigenous movements in other parts of the Americas are some- times similar in this regard, though not necessarily linked to reservation systems. African American or black nationalism and terms such as "Queer Nation" point to historic moments in which inventing some sort of nationalism is necessary for survival in the face of no territorial sovereignty at all. As an exploration of the dilemma of whether to deploy the strategy of nationalism, this paper offers a comparison of two recent publications that re-write the history of the Western hemi- MELUS, Volume 25, Numbers 3 / 4 (Fall / Winter 2000)</page><page sequence="2">VIRGINIA E. BELL sphere or the Americas: Eduardo Galeano's journalistic trilogy, Memoria del fuego: Los nacimientos (1982), Las caras y las mascaras (1984), El siglo del viento (1986) [Memory of Fire: Genesis, Faces and Masks, Century of the Wind], and Leslie Marmon Silko's novel Almanac of the Dead (1992).1 Emerging from Uruguay and the United States respectively, these are both voluminous publications that provoke epistemological crises about how we distinguish history from fiction and that resist the tendency to write Eurocentric nationalist history. They resist this tendency by countering an early mode of historiography often used to legitimize a particular "imagined community" (Anderson 6): the chronicle. At the same time, they offer an alternative mapping in the form of the textual construction of categories of people that, while seemingly national, are imagined as porous and provisional communities, rather than sealed and eternal communities, tran- scending time and context. Thus, they may be said to reinvent what "nation" means, dislodging it from Eurocentric narratives. Memoria delfuego is a three-volume compendium of short nar- ratives about people and events from locations all over the Ameri- cas, beginning with a brief non-chronological "pre-Columbian" section, and then listed by year from 1492-1986. Each narrative is, at most, two pages long, and endnotes are provided for the source of the information or story presented. In other words, the textually inscribed figure of Galeano is as an editor, compiler, translator, modifier, and interpreter of previously published texts. These texts range from the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and journalism, and are translated into Spanish from a variety of European languages (some of which themselves contain transla- tions from non-European or indigenous languages). Thus it is not easy to categorize this collection as "history" or "fiction." The covers of the paperback Spanish editions of all three volumes do not label them one way or the other. The English paperback edition labels volume I "mythology" and volumes II and III "fiction." These inconsistencies provoke an epistemological crisis about the authority of the text's version of history and the authority of any version of history. I argue that Memoria delfuego's chronological structure mimics the chronicle genre of early American historiog- raphy, yet profoundly revises, i.e. counters, many of that genre's 6</page><page sequence="3">COUNTER-CHRONICLING conventions and nationalist versions of history in which chronicles have been claimed and received. Almanac of the Dead is labeled a "novel," with the conventional publisher's disclaimer that "any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is entirely coincidental." Yet the title's claim that one is reading an "almanac" produces an episte- mological crisis like that provoked by Memoria del fuego. The almanac is a genre common to Maya and Laguna cultural traditions in the Americas, as well as to European American agriculturalists or so-called settlers. Despite the obvious historical conflicts between these kinds of communities, for both types almanacs encode a cyclical notion of time in which events are determined by seasonal patterns instead of, or more than, linear teleologies. This title, coupled with a Table of Contents and a visual map that frame Almanac of the Dead's prose narrative, highlights similarities between the conventions of narrative historiography and narrative fiction. Nevertheless, Almanac of the Dead does not share Memoria del fuego's overtly chronological structure; rather, several of its main characters are historiographers-of sorts-who engage in counter chronicling projects rather similar to the one Memoria del fuego constitutes. Angelita, a political organizer in Chiapas; Clinton, a homeless Vietnam veteran in Arizona; and Lecha, an old Yaqui woman produce historiographic manuscripts that resist the Euro- centric baggage of nationalist history. Further, the production and dissemination of their manuscripts partially exceed the grasp of the transnational publication industry and some of the exclusionary interests it serves. If we define nationalism as a political and cultural movement a group of people deploy to define themselves as a natural and eternal group of people with a particular history in order to be powerful and determining of their own realities, then nationalism's goal may be the formation of a territorial state or a culture's survival not necessarily bounded by physical borders and its own state apparatus (or a combination of the two).2 Western European middle classes and their descendants or counterparts in the Ameri- cas used nation formation to achieve sovereignty; they linked cultural nationalism to territorial sovereignty and state bureaucratic structures in order to ensure egalitarianism, safety, the exercise of 7</page><page sequence="4">VIRGINIA E. BELL free will, and a balance of power-with narrow definitions of citizenship to be sure. This broad definition of nationalism assumes that nations of any kind are fictions constructed in discourse and made to seem natural to serve a particular set of interests. As such, nations have to be continually reinvented and maintained, contested, and protected, as do their related concepts and institutions, such as national character and/or citizenship, and national history. As a social science that emerged in Europe along with the invention of the ideas of causal- ity, development, and civilization, history encodes models of maturation that stem from and reinforce notions of hierarchical difference. "Nations" are groups of people mature enough to have a history and to use the codes of history to record and make sense of their past and to construct their teleology. Such an anthropomorphic idea of "nation" involves measuring "maturity" in terms of the shifts in social, political, and economic systems that went hand in hand with nation-state formation in Western Europe; thus, maturity here really means that a shift in economic system to some form of capitalism (whether with slave labor, indentured labor, or wage labor) is what justifies a commu- nity's right to self-determination. At the same time, this maturation model went hand in hand with the invention of hierarchical racial categorization which enabled and enables the maintenance of inequitable deployments of political and material power locally, regionally, and globally. The very idea of there being essentially, naturally, and eternally different nations is predicated on an epistemological system based on a principle of hierarchical differ- ence; mapping nations is akin to charting racial types.3 The discourse of essential racial and/or national difference con- tradicts the discourse of the possibility of maturation, to be sure; yet such a contradiction is exactly the kind of discourse that produces colonial and neocolonial dominance. In its logic, a "lesser" group has to continually struggle to mature, even though it never will be able to, a catch-22 that seeks to maintain the status quo. Nationalism is therefore more than simply a European inven- tion; it is also a Eurocentric practice if it reinforces the hegemony of this epistemological system that aids in the maintenance of inequitable distributions of political and material power globally. This is what Partha Chatterjee calls the "derivative discourse" 8</page><page sequence="5">COUNTER-CHRONICLING problem with nationalism (30). Anti-colonial movements in the Americas not only have to confront this derivation, but also U.S.- American centrism, North American centrism, or Anglo-American centrism. When Galeano and Silko counter-chronicle, they counter various nationalisms in the hemisphere, but especially the hege- monic assertions of "Northem" states and of certain cultures within their borders, the U.S. in particular. This layered situation is compounded by the argument that the late twentieth century's regional and global restructuring means that both state and cultural national formations may be less deter- mining, while regional, hemispheric, global, and non-permanent formations may be more determining of experiences of privilege and oppression. Nation-states and/or nationalist institutions matter, but they often serve the interests of other forms of institutions that matter more in the era of late capitalism, especially transnational corporations (Baret and Cavanagh 13-21; Yuidice 2-4). Memoria del fuego responds to this complexity by countering the kind of nationalism associated with the reception of early U.S. American chronicles. In Hayden White's taxonomy of histo- riographic modes, chronicles seek to be more comprehensive than annals in what they record, to give more coherence to that informa- tion, and they may have a "central subject" in the textual form of "some sacral being endowed with the authority and power of the Lord" (White 16). Yet chronicles are different from a narrative which imposes a more obvious pattern on the chronological list, constructs certain events as more significant than others, implies causes and effects, and imposes moral closure on the information. Another important difference is the shift from the authority of a divine voice or providence in the chronicle to the authority of a human protagonist, hence more secular voice, in the narrative. This shift, however, not only occurs when one attempts to distinguish one text from another; it also occurs when a narrative text consti- tutes the reception of a chronicle text. In the case of narrative reception of William Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation, for example, the secularization of authority allows this chronicle to serve the interests of the U.S. nation-state, to construct its imagined national character as "mature" (read: exemplary of the qualities necessary for successful capitalism, e.g. risk taking, hard work, ability to save), and to justify the role it 9</page><page sequence="6">VIRGINIA E. BELL claims in the region of the Western hemisphere. To put it another way, a chronicle such as Bradford's becomes a sacred text that imbues the nation-state and a particular way of imagining national character with special authority. Myra Jehlen argues that Bradford uses his chronicle to revise an earlier account of the events at Plymouth and reconstruct them in order to emphasize a settlement that constitutes the formation of a new center for a new kind of civilization, superior to both indigenous civilizations in the Ameri- cas and European civilizations (Bercovitch 84-91).4 In the same vein, Sacvan Bercovitch maintains that Puritan chronicles such as Of Plymouth Plantation later fed a U.S. national fantasy of global superiority, not simply independence ("Discovering" 7-9). Memoria delfuego uses, but also profoundly revises, i.e. count- ers, the conventions of a chronicle like that of Bradford, and thereby undoes the providential authority appropriated by nation states in the process of textual reception. The beginning empha- sizes the pre-Columbian presence of multiple and complex cultures by referring to the creation stories of the Toltecs, the Aztecs, the Menomini, and many others. Yet the text does not use temporal or spatial markers for these references; the people do not seem bound by rigid lines between nation states or by cultural difference. While this lack of mooring runs the risk of de-historicizing, conflating, and idealizing all indigenous histories, the construction of the pre- Columbian past as anational is more about redesigning the present and future (the late twentieth and the twenty-first centuries) than about proving the truth of the past. Galeano's counter chronicle suggests the possibility of forming alliances instead of fomenting old antagonisms among differing indigenous cultures and political/ military formations.5 Moreover, the absence of temporal or spatial markers that current readers would recognize-i.e. Christian calendar years and place names established after colonization-is a refusal to inscribe the authority of the current grid of nation-states. From 1492 on, Memoria del fuego uses years, but de- nationalizes the chronicle because the narratives vary widely in space. In contrast to a focus on one settlement/site of conquest, such as Plymouth, the space of Memoria del fuego's narratives varies because each volume's entries jump back and forth between a dizzying number of locations in the Americas, the Caribbean, and sometimes Europe, Africa, and other continents. Although some of 10</page><page sequence="7">COUNTER-CHRONICLING the cities and towns named could be read as metaphoric of nation states or cultural nations, there are too many named in one state with too many different valences to make this tenable. The cumulative effect of this variation is the formation of links between seemingly disparate moments and sites, and across and in spite of national (state or cultural) boundaries in place at a particular moment or obeyed by a particular set of people. Additionally, although the trilogy is largely structured by a chronological list of years, the entries under each year are narra- tives that, in most cases, constitute the reception of other published material, imposing moral closure on that material. These narratives work together in such a way as to undermine the divine authority of chronicles as well as the secularized authority asserted by their narrative reception. In particular, they undermine Eurocentric narratives of economic development and hierarchical racial classi- fication that accompany the idea of the right to nation formation. To take an example that directly undermines the nationalist con- struction of "Plymouth," the trilogy's 1564 entry narrates the life of slave traders in port at Plymouth, England, and 1676 narrates the "New World" Plymouth settlers' violent capture and sale of Metacom, the Wampanoag chief (Los nacimientos 159, 291).6 Beginning with the title "Hawkins," the 1564 narrative is about the triangular slave trade between England, Africa, and the Antilles. The narrative emphasis is on a ship named Jesus which set sail four years previously (1560), setting a precedent for another voyage in the narrative present. Captained by John Hawkins both times, the ship's name, "Jesus," mocks the authority of divine providence that other chronicles invoke. The repetition of the voyage also shows the way in which the trilogy's counter- chronicling involves replacing linear chronology with synchronic descriptions. The first and last paragraphs are in the present tense, while the second past tense paragraph about the 1560 voyage, shows the history that made Hawkins's "present" possible. And the line, "La armada britdnica hara suyas estos 6rdenes en los siglos por venir" [The British armada will make these orders its own in the coming centuries] harkens to the "future" of the "New World" Plymouth that Hawkins's actions in the "Old World" Plymouth make possible. What a Eurocentric narrative might see as the development and expansion of a mercantilist (proto-capitalist) 11</page><page sequence="8">VIRGINIA E. BELL enterprise, Memoria delfuego construes as a lack of development or improvement. Throughout the whole trilogy, the repeated use of the present tense reinforces this synchronizing, this leveling of temporal differences, and mitigates the causal logic of chronological struc- ture. The other narrative with the place label "Plymouth" is listed more than a hundred years later in 1676. Like the "Hawkins" narrative, however, "Metacom" narrates primarily in present tense the ways in which the Plymouth settlement used Christian biblical interpretation to justify its actions. The narrative is about the English assassination of Metacom and the Plymouth settlement's decision to sell his son into slavery, which is justified by way of a particular interpretation of the II Chronicles. The beginning of II Chronicles reads as follows: "And as soon as he [Amaziah] was settled in the Kingdom, he slew them that killed the king his father. But he slew not their children as it is written in the law, even in the book of Moses to whom the Lord commanded saying: the father shall not die for the children's causes, nor the children for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin" (Tyndale 609). Presumably, this passage was used as proof that Metacom's son might try to kill Plymouth settlers and so justified selling the son as an act of mercy, rather than killing him. The narrative contains a final, future-tense line about the rela- tion between future Indians and the so-called settlement: "Dando otra prueba de generosidad, los vencedores ofrecen a los indios un pedacito de todo lo que antes tenian: en lo sucesivo, las comuni- dades indias de la regi6n, hayan peleado o no hayan peleado junto a Metacom, seran encerrados en cuatro reservas en la bahia de Massachusetts" (Los nacimientos 291) [As further proof of gener- osity, the victors offer the Indians a small piece of what used to be theirs: In the future the Indian communities of the region, whether or not they fought with Metacom, will be enclosed in four reserves in Massachusetts Bay] (Genesis 256). Thus, there is causality in these narratives about Plymouth, but also synchronic effects that undermine the idea of linear national maturation. This is summa- rized in the title of the narrative that precedes "Hawkins," "La historia que sera" [The History that Will Be], suggesting that we read the collapse of the past into the future and vice versa. Rather than avoid the historian's sin of presentism, then, the trilogy self- 12</page><page sequence="9">COUNTER-CHRONICLING consciously marks its narratives (and all historiography) as presen- tist. This stance counters Christian teleology and the pose of direct recording that Bradford's chronicle exemplifies. While narratives about Plymouth make this counter-chronicling obvious, numerous other narratives contribute as well. Las caras y las mascaras [Faces and Masks], Memoria del fuego's second volume, is a version of the period of nation-state formation in the Western hemisphere (1701-1900), but several of its narratives argue that the invention of nation-states in the Americas wore the mask of liberation over the face of a continuance of Eurocentric paradigms, only reinforced with new borders and apparatuses. "1813: La independencia es revoluci6n o mentira" [Independence is Revolution or a Lie] describes the fear of criollos in "Mexico" who don't want independence to go "too far," that is, to be ex- tended to or seized by everyone. This narrative concludes: "Esta independencia no les conviene. Ellos haran otra" (132) [This is not the sort of independence they were hoping for. They will make another] (107). Las caras y las mascaras makes the same argument about nationalism farther "North." The narrative "1776: Los Estados Unidos" concludes as follows: "Todos los hombres nacen iguales, dice la declaraci6n de independencia. Los esclavos, medio millon de esclavos negros, ni se enteran" (59) [All men are created equal, says the Declaration of Independence. The slaves, half a million black slaves, don't even hear about it] (47).7 The fact that volume II makes this argument about nation-states in the Southern Cone, Mexico, and the U.S., means that it collapses the South/North binary through which the hemisphere is often con- strued. In Galeano's trilogy, there is no more "progress" in the so- called North than in the so-called South. Because in Spanish mascaras [masks] is also a play on words meaning mds caras [more faces], the title of the trilogy's second volume suggests that there are/were other truths and perhaps other deployments of nationalism in the history of the Americas. All three volumes, in fact, are not so easily read as thoroughly anti- nationalist because they also produce shifting alliances. These alliances sometimes have great breadth and may be read as strate- gies of liberation that respond to the current ways in which capital is regionalized and globalized. The trilogy produces hemispheri- cally applicable categories of people, but within each of these 13</page><page sequence="10">VIRGINIA E. BELL categories there are conflicts and there are conflicts between them. Therefore, the alliances mutate over time; they are dynamic rather than fixed formations; in other words, they involve porous and provisional communities. For example, the trilogy produces one thread of hemispheric indigenous counter-discourse, often using it to rupture the rational- ity of the colonial discourse quoted in many narratives. At the same time, the trilogy produces a thread of history of women's activism and resistance to European and European American constructions of hierarchical gender difference, as well as a sub- category of women's literary history. These two threads sometimes run together and sometimes subdivide so that alliances based on the categories of "indigenous people" and "women" are deployed porously and only provisionally. In the first thread, the inscribed author Galeano has read some of his sources against the grain to produce a critique of colonialist discourse. For example, three narratives are juxtaposed under the entry "1717, Isle Dupas" [Dupas Isle]. The first, "Los fundadores" [The Founders], describes French explorer Pierre de La Veren- drye's room in which he imagined and constructed a preliminary map of Canada: "El mapa de Canada ocupa toda una pared. Entre la costa este y los grandes lagos, unas pocas ciudades, unos cuan- tos fortines. Mas alla, un inmenso espacio de misterio. De otra pared, bajo los canios cruzados de los mosquetes, cuelgan cabelle- ras de indios enemigos, oscurecidas por el humo del tabaco" (19) [The map of Canada occupies a whole wall. Between the East coast and the Great Lakes, a few cities, a few small forts. In the background, an immense mysterious space. On the other wall, scalps of enemy Indians darkened by tobacco smoke hang beneath the crossed muskets] (16). The second narrative, "Retablo de los indios" [Portrait of the Indians], echoes this colonial mis en scene by citing travel writing that criticizes the Chippewa because of their egalitarian gender roles and "libertine" sexuality (20-21). However, the third narrative, "Cantos de los indios Chippewa, en la regi6n de los Grandes Lagos" [Chippewa Indian Songs in the Great Lakes Region], transcribes songs that highlight Chippewa pain, death, and separation from the land (21). However mediated, this "indigenous" discourse allows one to imagine what is missing, erased, and mutilated by the event cited in the first two narratives: 14</page><page sequence="11">COUNTER-CHRONICLING Chippewa cultural practices have been replaced with hierarchical gender roles and human experience of the land in terms of topog- raphy has been replaced with U.N. borders that now divide the Great Lakes region between Canada and the United States. Galeano's narratives imply that the scientific claims of cartography and nation building mask the ideological desires of control, vio- lence, and mutilation of the body's and the earth's topography. Memoria delfuego also draws the reader's attention to the his- torian's dependency on sources by providing end notes for most of the narratives. In this particular instance, Galeano cites two Anglo- American texts for the Chippewa songs, John Bierhorst's In the Trail of the Wind: American Indian Poems and Ritual Orations (1973) and Frederick W. Turner III's The Portable North- American Indian Reader (1977). The inclusion of the Chippewa song is not, then, a naive claim to represent, but instead an exam- ple of how one tinkers with highly mediated archives to produces fissures in master narratives. Just as he reads sources against the grain to debate representa- tions of indigenous communities in colonial narratives, Memoria del fuego's inscribed author includes women as major actors in history; from narratives about Chippewa gender relations, female deities, the Salem witch trials, women maroons, twentieth-century figures such as Evita Per6n, Rigoberta Menchu, and Domitila Barrios de Chungara, to literary figures, the text relentlessly involves women in the histories of social upheaval, privilege, and resistance movements. At first glance, they all seem to collapse into one massive thread of women's history running consistently and coherently throughout the trilogy. On the other hand, narra- tives about women's history in the Americas sometimes stand in conflict with narratives about, for example, indigenous resistance. There is no single alliance between a variety of subordinate positions. The category of women's literary history, for instance, crosses borders of both cultural and territorial nations and suggests alli- ances based on the ideological energy of literary projects. Volumes II and III put Frances Brooke, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Delmira Agustini, and Alfonsina Stomi together. Their nations of origin, Canada, the U.S., Uruguay, and Argentina, respectively, are seemingly irrelevant to their stronger commonality. The entries 15</page><page sequence="12">VIRGINIA E. BELL about them are all titled with their first names only, the endnotes for all three refer to autobiographies and biographies (similar kinds of sources), and they are all described to some degree in terms of defying prescribed gender roles in their respective contexts. However, they are each framed by different entries that connect them to different networks potentially at odds with their seemingly sealed unity. To take just one example, there are two entries after 1769: "La primera novela escrita en America" [The First Novel Written in America] and "Los indios y los suenios en la novela de Frances Brooke" [Indians and Dreams in the Novel of Frances Brooke] (45-46). While Galeano gives credit to a woman for writing "the first American novel" and draws a line connecting her to nineteenth and twentieth-century women writers such as Gilman and Stomi, we can also use these narratives to indict Brooke for constructing "Indians" as inferior in intelligence ("menos ra- zonable" [less reasonable/rational]) because of the importance they grant to dreams. If Brooke's accomplishment destabilizes the link between gender position and relations of domination and subordi- nation, her privilege is also maintained by the ideology of her racial and ethnocentric narrative.8 Although Memoria delfuego is relentless in its expose and cri- tique of oppressive systems in the Americas, there is no one community to which the text has primary allegiance. Every textu- ally constructed category is also dismantled; I disagree, then, with critics who describe the trilogy as a manichaean construction of colonizers, such as Hawkins and the Plymouth settlers, and colo- nized, such as the slaves and Metacom. They suggest that the trilogy ultimately forms a massive narrative of alliance between all oppressed positions, which counters a Eurocentric narrative. Some make this charge in praise, some make it in blame, but either way my reading of the intersection between "women" and "indigenous discourse" leads us to question both the persuasiveness and the consequences of their readings (Torres Fierro 57; Palaversich 149). The consequences are potentially great because manichaean narratives participate in the same epistemological stance towards history that the problematic idea of national history does. The adjective "manichaean" means dualism: the belief in and construc- tion of two social universes, one good and one evil, in a theological sense. Frantz Fanon discusses the role of this epistemological 16</page><page sequence="13">COUNTER-CHRONICLING system in his description of conqueror/native relations in The Wretched of the Earth, and Abdul R. JanMohamed elaborates on this; the latter argues that manichaean allegory is the central trope of colonial discourse, that it functions to transform racial differ- ence into "moral and even metaphysical difference" regarded as "evil and barbarity" (80). Describing Memoria del fuego as manichaean erases the variety and complexity of the different forms of subordination the trilogy explores and, most importantly, the potential tensions among different positions of subordination. Like Memoria del fuego, Almanac of the Dead eludes manichaean reductionism even while it resists Eurocentric models of nation building. The major framing devices of Almanac of the Dead, a Table of Contents and a visual map, set into motion this novel's dismantling of the way in which the so-called Western hemisphere has been carved into nation-states with borders imag- ined as natural and eternal and the way in which some versions of this map attempt to naturalize a hierarchy of these nation-states and the cultural variety within them. The Table of Contents displays competing systems of signification by titling the six parts "The United States of America," "Mexico," "Africa," "The Americas," "The Fifth World," and "One World, Many Tribes" (8-12). A Eurocentric nationalist view of history would posit "One World, Many Tribes" as the oldest and least mature social formation. "The Fifth World" would then refer to, not just so-called third world underdeveloped nations, but pre-Columbian indigenous cultures. Just after the so-called discovery, the Western hemisphere would become "the Americas," and "Africa" (a continent) and Mexico (a "third world" nation) would precede the U.S., and the latter would stand as the culmination of national maturation and civilization. But instead of such a pattern of place and development, Almanac of the Dead's contents locate the U.S. as the formation to move away from and more plural, non-national phenomena as the formations to move towards. To complement and complicate this reversal of the Euro- American nationalist narrative, the title of each Part contains numerous Books, whose titles exhibit different systems of naming as well. For instance, the title "Africa" does not refer to the vast continent across the Atlantic and South of Europe, but rather contains plots organized around states and cities in the U.S. This 17</page><page sequence="14">VIRGINIA E. BELL semiotic dissonance emphasizes the history of forced migration of enslaved Africans to the Americas more than the voluntary migra- tion of Europeans. In calling attention to this history, "Africa" suggests that there is a large population of descendants of enslaved Africans practicing power as much as anyone else, that is, vying to produce realities in the Americas. These sorts of Book titles imply that the U.S., as a nation-state that privileges particular cultural nations, cannot contain the heterogeneity and conflicts within its territory. Almanac of the Dead's visual map echoes this semiotic disso- nance and attention to paths of migration and travel. The two-page map represents only the midriff of the U.S./Mexico border but points to and labels other places beyond the pages' contours (14- 15). A borderline runs through the middle of what we see, but only Mexico is labeled (not the U.S.) and Tucson is a little to the right of center, rather than exactly in the center. A smattering of other places-oceans, islands/nations, cities, sites of monuments and events-are labeled and next to each one a list of character names. The characters, however, are from different moments in history and are connected to dotted lines to represent the migratory paths they take. There are four boxed short narratives in English that refer to past, present, and future events, some of which make reference to Christian calendar years. The cumulative effect of all these details is a map that levels three-dimensional, vertical notions of time into a two-dimensional and horizontal representation, which undoes the very idea of clear distinctions or borders between the past, present, and future. Moreover, because of the presence of dotted lines (paths of migration and travel), this is a map of circuits that undo spatial and temporal borders. Such a framing map, then, is a map anxious about its own pretensions, a map refusing the neutral claims of sciences like cartography and history, and refus- ing the logic of national history. Some of the dotted lines represent the movement of histo- riographic manuscripts through time and space in the process of their production, dissemination, and reception, in addition to representing the movements of characters who work on these manuscripts. That is to say, Almanac of the Dead's difference from Memoria del fuego is its construction of characters working on projects similar, although not identical, to that of Galeano. An- 18</page><page sequence="15">COUNTER-CHRONICLING gelita la Escapia is a former Marxist who tries to perform oral chronological histories as a technique of popular education in Chiapas, Mexico. Clinton is a "Black Indian" and homeless Vietnam veteran whose "notebooks" and "broadcasts" are de- signed to inspire uprisings in Tucson, Arizona, and other parts of the Americas. And Lecha, an old Yaqui woman, is editing and transcribing a found ancient manuscript, "Yoeme's old note- books," the almanac for which the novel is named.9 These stories are embedded in many other sorts of stories and plots and together they form the prose narrative framed by the Table of Contents and the visual map. In addition to manuscript production, Angelita, Clinton, and Lecha are connected to plots about so-called legal, local, and transnational activities, such as blood and plasma banks, private "security" companies, real estate, building construction and development, international relations, and publication. In addition they are linked to so-called illegal or unofficial activities: the drug trade, black market arms sales, illegal immigration into the U.S. and the Sanctuary movement, and social change movements and rebellions. In this complex context, Angelita, Clinton, and Lecha use counter-chronicling in their historiographies to serve a variety of interrelated purposes. Their manuscripts dismantle Eurocentric narratives that accrue around the idea of "nation," yet at the same time, as with reading Galeano's Memoria del fuego, reading Almanac of the Dead as an anti-nationalist counter-chronicle raises the question of what alternative maps or groupings of people emerge. In response, these characters simultaneously, if paradoxi- cally, use their manuscripts to invent "national" communities, but as more porous and provisional communities: a group of people who organize a "March North" from Chiapas, an "Army of the Homeless," "Black Indians," and the Yaqui tribe. Finally, the production and reception of their manuscripts by and large exceed the grasp of the transnational print publication industry, even though the characters are themselves somehow compromised by their connections to networks that are certainly not ideologically trouble-free, as is Silko's novel.10 After having been trained in Cuba, Angelita is in Chiapas help- ing to organize a "March North." Leaders of this movement include "El Feo" ("The Ugly One") and Tacho, twin brothers who 19</page><page sequence="16">VIRGINIA E. BELL are revisions of the twin brothers Hunahpu and Xbalanque, the heroes of the Maya Popol Vuh (Tedlock 35). On behalf of the community, El Feo has to find out whether Angelita is really a representative of communist Cuba or a critic; the community will only trust her if she has a strong critical stance towards Cuba and El Feo is eventually happy to report that she does. Angelita re- spects Marx for ideas about inhabiting and using land that defy the notion of private land ownership; she associates him with the argument that nation-states work to benefit corporations, which do not in turn benefit all human beings: "Engels and Marx had understood that the earth belongs to no one. No human, individuals or corporations, no cartel of nations, could 'own' the earth; it was the earth who possessed the humans and it was the earth who disposed of them" (749, emphasis added). But she is of the opinion that both communism and capitalism have been practiced in such a way as to make human society attempt to dominate the earth. She thinks that Engels and Marx "had been on the right track with their readings on Native American communal economies," but "they had not understood that the earth was mother to all beings, and they had not understood anything about the spirit beings" (749). Angelita emerges as an intellectual, then, who makes arguments much like that of Paula Gunn Allen: "Ethnographer Lewis Henry Morgan wrote an account of Iroquoian matriarchal culture, pub- lished in 1877, that heavily influenced Marx and the development of communism, particularly lending it the idea of the liberation of women from patriarchal dominance" (195). Although Almanac of the Dead is not as wholeheartedly a celebration of what Allen calls "gynarchical" tribal formations, Angelita represents the stance that Marx learned many of his ideas from a distorted ethnographic account. In the process of educating herself and in popular education attempts, Angelita uses written and oral modes of counter- chronicling; the novel emphasizes the different contexts in which she uses each mode, what ideological and epistemological strug- gles each mode and context entail for her, and what alliances she manages to produce or not produce in each context. Aside from conversations with Angelita, El Feo's evidence of her shared criticism of Cuba is the "notebook" she filled while studying with the Cubans. In the Cuban context, Angelita wrote the title "Friend 20</page><page sequence="17">COUNTER-CHRONICLING of the Indians" on the cover of the notebook as a joke and thinly veiled reference to Fray Bartolome de las Casas because "The clergy and the communists took credit for any good, however small, that had been done for the Indians since the arrival of the Europeans" (314). Thus, like Galeano's Memoria del fuego, her notebook is a work of scholarship with reference to other published texts and "authors" in order to construct a chronology of events in the Americas, in her case, specifically a list of Indian and African American uprisings from 1510-1945 (527-30). In addition to sharing a span of over four hundred years with Memoria delfuego, this list is labeled first by year, then by the location of the event, after which follows a brief description of the event. But while Galeano's text usually names locations that are cities, Angelita's notebook most often names nation-states: Cuba, Colombia, U.S.A., Peru, Mexico, Paraguay, Jamaica, Haiti, and Bolivia. However, these place names stand in contrast to other cultural and political nations mentioned in the descriptions of events: Maya, Incas, Zuni, Hopi, Acoma Pueblo, Chicoratos, Cavametos, Yaqui, Pimas, Tarahumaras, Pueblo, Pontiac, Yumas, Creek, Mayos, and "Black Indians." This double list means that Angelita's chronicle is focused on revolts against the nation-states imposed on the land masses of the Americas as a result of European colonization. This focus forges a commonality between all these indigenous nations, as well as a commonality between them and enslaved Africans and their descendants, a group the novel calls "Black Indians." These sorts of nations, then, have porous boundaries that shift over time, that are contingent. As with the pre-Columbian section in Memoria del fuego, counter-chronicling here is about producing alliances between many nations as well as inventing nations for strategic reasons. Angelita's counter-chronicling shifts from a written text to an oral testimony when she uses it for popular education in Chiapas. In the presence of a campesino community and March North organizers, Angelita reads her chronicle as evidence with which to prosecute Bartolomeo (a play on the name Bartolome de Las Casas), a Cuban communist official accused of racism and conde- scension towards "native" peoples. Her goal is capital punishment for Bartolomeo, but she must convince the community which will 21</page><page sequence="18">VIRGINIA E. BELL decide the verdict and sentence. The narration of this event in the novel complicates Angelita's character construction and leads us to ponder just what sort of role her counter-chronicling plays in hegemony building in Chiapas. After Angelita reads the events between 1510 and 1945, her audience does not readily accept her judgment; their reaction is cautious, according to a narrator whose free indirect discourse is focalized primarily through Angelita in this section: "The village people murmured over the figures; the people were not in the habit of looking at the 'bigger picture,' as Angelita liked to call it. Of course the white man had never wanted Native Americans to contemplate confederacies between the tribes of the Americas; that would mean the end of European domination" (530). Here the narrator and Angelita seem frustrated with the campesinos' reac- tion to the idea of a multi-national confederacy. The narrator later adds: "People were not sure about killing an outsider such as the Cuban, crime against history or no crime against history. First, there were the questions concerning the white man's spirit or ghost, and where it would go after they hanged him" (531). This comment implies that Angelita's strategy of using European forms of historical accumulation and documentation in a makeshift courtroom and her advocacy of the death penalty fail to take into account other ways of knowing, judging, and conceiving of death. Narrativization of the production and reception of the chronicle in this chapter is ultimately caught up in the narrator's ambivalent position between empathy for Angelita as she attempts popular education and empathy for the Chiapaneco community's cautious regard for the "big picture." The challenge Angelita faces is more than just a shift in class allegiance and identification; she must also grapple with ethnicities in process (Chiapaneco and Maya for instance) whose members might not agree with her systems of authority. While Clinton's historiographic practice is not in the context of some sort of "trial," he does use researched chronological histori- ography to educate himself and to incite others to action. His counter-chronicling serves both the goal of inventing an ethnicity he calls "Black Indian" and the goal of creating connections with those he considers this group's allies so that they can together conduct a massive uprising. His notebooks constitute another 22</page><page sequence="19">COUNTER-CHRONICLING chronological list of acts of resistance in the Americas, this one spanning more than three hundred years from 1526-1862 (742-46). Reminding us more of Galeano's trilogy than Angelita's notebook, most of the place names that follow Clinton's years are for cities- beginning with "Pee Dee River, South Carolina" and ending with "Yazoo City, Mississippi"-but cities within the current borders of the U.S. These place names are dislodged from a chronicle of U.S. history which locates its origins in settlements such as Plymouth and transformed into sites in the historical trajectory of the inven- tion of a "Black Indian" community. Meanwhile, the sources for his information point to some of the alliances he is building and to the porous borders of his "Black Indian" nation. For instance, the narrator tells us that his main sources for the events cited in the chronicle are a book given to him by the Hopi and a book by Herbert Aptheker, a white U.S.-American (742). Clinton even writes at the top of the page that begins the chronological list: "Thank You, Herbert Aptheker!" (742). Clinton's written chronicle is also a self-education project that inspires him to co-found an "Army of the Homeless" with Roy, a white Vietnam veteran with one artificial arm. Although their revolt is eventually suppressed by Tucson Police SWAT teams, they maintain a belief in the possibilities of coalition and revolt: "Clinton had promised the Barefoot Hopi he would spread the word among the brothers and sisters in the cities. . . . Roy was going to lie low until cooler weather came, maybe contact camps of eco-warriors in the mountains of Montana or go to the homeless veterans' camps Clinton had visited in the Winter" (747-48). The chapter "Rise Up!" interpolates an excerpt of Clinton's notebooks into its narrative about "The International Holistic Healers Con- vention" in Tucson that has drawn many of the novel's main characters into the same city at the time. Here Clinton meets activists from various parts of the Americas, such as "the Barefoot Hopi," whose "plan called for a nationwide jail and prison uprising to be triggered by the execution of a prisoner or the outbreak of riots in the cities"(747-48). Like that of Angelita, Clinton's counter-chronicling begins in written form and then shifts to a different medium, this time, radio broadcasts. Waiting for the right moment for the convergence of all the activists' schemes, Clinton decides to connect with the 23</page><page sequence="20">VIRGINIA E. BELL spirits of his African ancestors by heading "to the remote moun- tains in Haiti": "All Hell was going to break loose. The best was yet to come" (749). In Haiti, Clinton composes radio transcripts for broadcasts that will incite these future networks of resistance. One planned broadcast, "First Successful Slave Revolution in the Americas," is a version of the eighteenth-century revolution in Haiti that argues that the revolution has not yet been realized, and thus echoes Las caras y las mascaras, volume II of Galeano's trilogy (428-31). While Silko's novel emphasizes the move from written counter chronicles to oral and radio media in Angelita's and Clinton's projects, Lecha's project stresses a move in the other direction and the descriptions of her manuscript dismantle hierarchical compari- sons of these varying technologies. Lecha has inherited fragments of an ancient almanac from her grandmother, Yoeme. Just as human bodies migrate, the manuscript has traveled through time and space (originating in "Mexico"), a circuit a reader can only trace by splicing together passages from various sections of the novel. One such passage explains that, "for hundreds of years, guardians of the almanac notebooks had made clumsy attempts to repair tor pages. Some sections had been splashed with wine, others with water or blood' and "the pages of ancient paper had been found between the pages of horse gut parchment carried by the fugitive Indian slaves who had fled north to escape European slavery" (569, emphasis added). This manuscript is conceived of as corporeal, stained with blood and held between horse gut parch- ment, a material description of text that challenges the opposition between writing as technology and orality as an act of the natural body. This manuscript also travels through time, five hundred plus years of European attempts to conquer and thereby invent the Americas, and through space, from South to North, defying the borders of nation-states and the cultural borders between varying Indian peoples, an echo of the March North from Chiapas. Such traveling highlights the mutability of written text as well as its persistence; just like oral literature, this text undergoes transforma- tions and is put to different uses in different contexts. Indeed, like Angelita and Clinton's projects, the novel narrativ- izes the reception of the almanac in such a way as to keep it from being the property of only one nation or imagined community. 24</page><page sequence="21">COUNTER-CHRONICLING When Lecha receives the fragmented manuscript, she knows that its previous keepers had spliced sections from other texts into it and had contributed their own stories to it because "whole sections had been stolen from other books and from the proliferation of 'farmer's almanacs' published by patent-drug companies and medicine shows that gave away the almanacs as advertisements" (570), a manuscript history that carves out alternative systems of publication and that reveals that the text has become culturally plural and contestatory. For example: "Not even the parchment pages or fragments of ancient paper could be trusted; they might have been clever forgeries, recopied, drawn, and colored painstak- ingly" (570). Even Lecha's grandmother, Yoeme, contributes her own versions of her community's stories in her own handwriting (579). Lecha edits one part of the almanac by ordering textual frag- ments into a chronological list of events in the Americas between 1560 and 1621 (577-78). Rather than a list of human acts of resistance to colonization and enslavement by other humans, as with Angelita's, Clinton's, and Galeano's chronicles, this is a list of destructive events and natural "disasters." Four of the eight entries describe invasions and resultant plagues, such as smallpox, while the remaining entries document resistance to this coloniza- tion: lightening that strikes a missionaries' church, a solar eclipse that ruins a Catholic feast day, and a whirlwind storm that ruins a settlement's planting season. Rather than planned social move- ments and their predicted effects, tribal or otherwise, or the forma- tion of nations and nationalism, agency here is ascribed to the Earth. Lecha combines this epistemology with the Western histo- riographic list of years; hers is a hybrid text, made of both animal, bodily materials and human ingenuity, and conceiving of hegem- ony building in terms of the effects of phenomena that are not all acts of human will. Thus it is not surprising that, although Lecha uses counter chronicling as the primary editor of the ancient almanac, the character Seese, a poor white woman cocaine addict with a missing child, also modifies the chronicle to meet her own needs. In her capacity as Lecha's secretary, Seese uses Lecha's counter- chronicle to mourn her lost child and thereby keep herself from using more cocaine. When Lecha gives her handwritten notes to 25</page><page sequence="22">VIRGINIA E. BELL enter in the wordprocessor, Seese enters her own recollection of a dream about her son instead: "In the photographs you are smiling / taller than I have ever seen you / older than you were when I lost you / The colors of the lawn and house behind are indistinct / milked to faded greens and browns. / I know I will never hold you again" (595). By transforming her data entry work into poetic remembering, Seese transforms the almanac from a multi-tribal Indian historiographic compilation into a lyrical recording of her own grief and loss. Almanac of the Dead, therefore, repeatedly and overtly reminds readers that the ancient notebooks move between the hands of unnamed historical persons and tribes, to Yoeme and Lecha and the Yaqui tribe, to Seese, a white woman whose tribal (read community or national) allegiances are not clear to herself. All of this combines to reinforce the idea that the historiography of this "almanac," like Silko's novel, is not the property or even the process of just one imagined community. Instead, it is a manuscript that changes hands, that moves through varying communities and is used to invent them. Furthermore, this almanac remains outside the profit interests of the drug and print publication industries, mitigating the complicity of the farmer's almanacs stolen from and inserted in its pages, and mitigating the complicity of the novel in which it resides, a Penguin paperback. The counter-chroniclers in Memoria del fuego and Almanac of the Dead-Galeano as the inscribed author, Angelita, Clinton, Lecha, and Silko as the inscribed author-are not "pure"; they struggle against hegemonies with which they may wish they were not compromised, hegemonies that somehow benefit from their labor or that use them as objects or instruments. Angelita learns the lesson of her hegemonic bind when she misunderstands the reason- ing of the Chiapanecos she tries to educate. Clinton and his fellow homeless Vietnam veterans regularly supply blood and plasma to centers owned by characters involved in global industries such as the development of exclusive housing communities and golf courses that are not ecologically sustainable (and the privatization of military training and arms sales that amounts to a proliferation of mercenary activities). Lecha and her sister, Zeta, have drug deals with other characters that link them into networks of indus- tries that practice horrifying human exploitation, e.g. the illegal 26</page><page sequence="23">COUNTER-CHRONICLING trade in human organs harvested from disappeared and tortured persons. And Galeano and Silko are, after all, cogs in the profit making machine of Siglo Veintiuno Editores, Pantheon Books, and Penguin. Thus, both Memoria delfuego and Almanac of the Dead elude manichaean reductionism; no one in either text is a counter- chronicler free from the national and global webs of the late twentieth century. Perhaps such ideological contradictions make whatever alterna- tive networks of historiographic publication they do create all the more important and meaningful. Their counter-chronicling hap- pens both because of the late twentieth century's tangled web, and in spite of that web's problems. Rey Chow argues that rather than asking simply how "intellectuals" can obtain hegemony (a refer- ence to Gramsci), she feels compelled to ask: "how do intellectuals struggle against a hegemony which already includes them and which can no longer be divided into the state and civil society in Gramsci's terms, nor be clearly demarcated into national and transnational spaces? (Chow 15-16, emphasis added). Memoria del fuego and Almanac of the Dead struggle against this hegemony by imagining historiographic projects that do not serve the interests of one static community exclusively. Silko adds to this counter chronicling an imagining of characters who occupy less institu- tionally compromised "intellectual" positions, while her novel continues to emphasize the regional and global economic networks in which all the characters are caught. Notes 1. Galeano is an Uruguayan activist, journalist, historian, and novelist, and a prominent figure associated with recent textual projects to revise historiography in the Americas. Many of his publications have been celebrated (perhaps more outside academia than inside) for attacking Eurocentrism and United States imperialism in the Americas. He is perhaps best known for Las venas abiertas de America Latina [Open Veins of Latin America] (1971), a work which inspired the radio performance series "Quinientos Afios" [Five Hundred Years]. But some of his other well known and widely translated historiographic works include, Dias y noches de amor y guerra [Days and Nights of Love and War] (1978) and Nosotros decimos no [We Say No!] (1989). 2. This is abbreviated and very loose paraphrasing from the complex definition work of both Hobsbawm (5-8) and Anderson (6). 27</page><page sequence="24">VIRGINIA E. BELL 3. See Hobsbawm's discussion of the links between national and racial catego- ries (107-109). See Foucault for a theory of epistemological shifts in Europe that describes the post-Enlightenment way of knowing as based on a principle of hierarchical difference. 4. Jehlen's positioning of Bradford's chronicle in this way suggests that his text echoes (or is made to echo) the role of the Chronicles in the Judeo-Christian bible. Although White does not take up a discussion of the biblical books Chronicles I and Chronicles II, other scholars explain that there are ongoing debates about just how "historical" these books are, and whether or not they are composed of sources (Japhet 5-7). Some also argue that these books are key to generating a genealogy and a history of Israel; thus they function as theology and as nationalist history (Japhet 43-49). Bradford's chronicle does much the same for the Puritans and similarly relies on divine authority even as it consti- tutes a history. 5. Although the space of the project at hand does not permit a thorough review of all the literature on this topic, many activists, historians, and social scientists describe the ways in which the idea of the "Ethnic Indian" is used to forge a political community. See, for example, Deloria, Jr. and Lytle's distinction between "traditionalists" and "ethnics." Similarly, the Before Columbus Foundation uses this temporal reference in its name to build alliances among varying kinds of "ethnic" communities. 6. Although Galeano's title for volume I is Los nacimientos (literally translated as "births" or "origins"), it is interesting to note that Genesis is the title for the English translation. Perhaps this choice is a counter-biblical strategy: the volume deliberately echoes the book of Genesis but counters the way in which coloniz- ers, such as the Plymouth settlers, interpreted Genesis. My reading, however, proceeds from Galeano's Spanish version. 7. Although I am arguing that Memoria del fuego's deconstruction of the South=Oppression/North=Freedom binary is politically important and useful, I also take issue with this particular narrative's suggestion that "blacks" in the U.S. didn't hear about, no se enteraron de, the Declaration of Independence. Of course, Galeano's point is that the Declaration's authors did not have full inclusiveness in mind, but one must add that excluded people often have been savvy enough to know about such events. 8. Because of the complexity with which the trilogy treats women's history, my argument complicates that of Franco, who concludes that "Canada is left out altogether" in the trilogy and that Memoria delfuego ends up "caught in the old gendered discourse which considers America to be a woman and woman clay or territory" (183). There are entries which warrant these comments, to be sure, but it should be quite clear from the numerous examples that I have given that Canada is very much included and that the trilogy's discourse on gender is not at all monologic. 9. There are other important characters who also produce historiographies in some form or another, such as Wilson Weasel Tail, who gives performances as a "poet lawyer," and Trigg, whose "notebooks" form a diary of his memory of a 28</page><page sequence="25">COUNTER-CHRONICLING 29 car accident that paralyzed him from the waist down and of his violent thoughts towards women and people of color. While I analyze these characters and manuscripts in great detail in another paper, there is not room to do them justice here. Moreover, their modes of historiography do not fit the counter-chronicling model as closely as do those of Angelita, Clinton, and Lecha. 10. Baret and Cavanagh argue that "the publishing industry has been trans- formed in the last thirty years" into merely a part of "global media conglomer- ates" whose primary goal is profit, and whose primary strategy is therefore "synergy": the marketing of trademarked characters in multiple forms of media simultaneously (e.g. books, films, T-shirts, theme parks, etc.) (91-93). Some- times these global media conglomerates function to benefit a certain nation- state, perhaps one which they consider home, but just as often "they are quite prepared to publish books critical of their countries of origin, provided there are good business reasons for doing so" (108).
