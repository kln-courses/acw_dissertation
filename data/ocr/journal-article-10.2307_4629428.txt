A second, unstated purpose of the article is to challenge some of th-e ideas I have presented regarding the long-held theory of ani- conism that has been used to interpret these early Buddhist materials for more than a century. At the same time that Dehejia challenges aspects of my work, she incorporates into her multivalency theory one of the most important contributions of my analysis-my explanation of a certain type of composition as focusing on Bucddhist sacred sites. Although her multivalency theory uipholds the abiding belief in the aniconic theory, her interpretation of early Buddlhist art is tempered by accepting my proposal that not all of the works of art that have been interpreted as aniconic images are aniconic. I agreed to write this response for tvo reasons. First, although Dehejia's theory of mnultialency offers an interesting and clever amnalgam of the traditional aniconic theory and iny owvn ideas andl seeks to move the interpretation of early Bud- dhist art in a new direction, I am not convinced that multivalency, as she has presented the case, is a viable alternative to the previously proposed viewpoints. Second, I wish to respond to her criticisms of my work. Because I examine the theory of aniconism and related iconographical, historical, social, religious, and cultural issues in my forthcoming book on the early Buddhist art of India, I will not use this forum to present the extensive materials I have collected. Rather, here I will deal specificallywith problems in theway my work has been interpreted and applied in Dehe- jia's article. Although I believe that Dehejia's reactions to my research are premature since my full study has not yet been published,2 it is impor- tant at this stage to correct misunderstandings and misrepresentations ofmywork. Further, since in a nuimber of instances Dehejia actually argues for my viewpoint without acknowledging her in- debtedness to my work, I welcome the opportuni- ty to clarify the dlerivation of some of her interpre- tations. Let me state at the outset that I have never claimed nor intended to claim that there are no "aniconic" works of art. In fact, I specifically allow for the possibility.3 My position is that the theory of aniconism is not valid as an all-inclusive expla- nation for the early Buddhist art of India and that the vast majority of artistic compositions that have been explained as aniconic scenes are not suibstitutes and do not portray substitutes for anthlropomorphic representations of a Buddha. Whlat I propose is that the explanatory power of the aniconic theory has been vastly overestimated and that the theory has been indiscriminately applied, much to the detriment of our under- standing of early Buddhist art and its religious mieanings and cultural contexts. My book will propose a series of new generalizations based on patterns of evidence, rather than a new absolutist theory. In light of what will be my reinterpreta- tion of thle vast majority of reliefs, I believe that the montuments and the practices of early Bud- dhlismii will also require renewed study. To clarify to readers where my work on early Buiddhist art has been published, I first ques- tioned the validity of the theory of aniconism as an all-emblracing explanation for the art of early Buddhism in my Art of Ancient India4 In that context, I was not able to present more than a few</page><page sequence="2">112 SUSAN L. HUNTINGTON basic components of my larger research project since the theme of the Art ofAncient Indiawas the development of the art of the Indic world over many centuries, and a lengthy digression on the problem of aniconism would have been a detour from the main theme of the book. I also pub- lished an article in the ArtJoumnalin which I chose one specific type of image to discuss. I wish to emphasize "one specific type" because Dehejia has apparently misunderstood that article to rep- resent a comprehensive, rather than selective, presentation of my ideas regarding the scenes appearing in early Buddhist art, an important point to which I shall return. Since that article was solicited to appear in an issue of the A7t Jumrnal devoted to the presentation of current research in the field, the paper had to fulfill certain edito- rial criteria that applied to all authors whose work had been selected for publication. Specifically, I was limited in terms of the number of words and illustrations, which had to conform to the space allotted to the other authors, and I was asked to write the article in a way that would interest readers outside the specialized field of South Asian art. Therefore, for the At jfournal article I chose to present a component of my stuidy tlhat could stand alone. Interestingly, this particular component of my larger study-the idlentifica- tion of reliefs that represent worship scenes at sacred Buddhist sites-is one that Dehejia adopts in her article (without, however, acknowledging me as the source of the notion). In addition to these two publications, I have made a number of oral presentations on aspects of my work. These inclucle papers at the 1988 and 1991 conferences sponsored by the American Committee for Soutlh Asian Art. These papers were strictly limited in lengtlh and could only address very narrow aspects of mny stuidy; thlus, some of Dehejia's misuindlerstandlings of miy re- search may have arisen fromi these presentations as well.5 While the 1988 talk emphasized the materials ultimately publislhed in tlhe ArtJournal article, the 1991 presentation specifically target- ed the historiography of the theory of aniconism, a subject that I believe is intimately related to the passionate advocacy of the theory that mny critics so commonly display. I have given lengtlhier pre- sentations of my work at the conference of thle International Association for Buddlhist Studlies in Paris during summer 1991 and in invited talks at Harvard University's Center for the Advanced Study of World Religions in spring 1990 and at the University of Chicago in spring 1987, to name julst a few.6 Critique of Dehejia 's Article: Structural and Theoretical MULTIVALENCY The stated purpose of Dehejia's article is to demonstrate and advocate that early Buddhist art was imbued with multiple, simultaneous mean- ings that could be conveyed by individual em- blems (45). The theoretical concept of multiva- lency is one that I not only endorse but applaud, as attested by my introduction of the term slesa, which Dehejia uses to explain the notion of mul- tivalency, in nmy Art of Ancient India (I985).7 The idlea of multiple meanings in works of art is a concept tlhat I have published elsewhere, lec- tured about in public, and extensively incorpo- rate into my teaching, as my students are well aware. John C. Huntington has also used the concept of multivalency to explain works of art. His forthcoming article entitled "The Iconogra- phy of Barabuduir Revisited: The Concept of Slesa (Multivalent Symbology) and the Sarva- [buddlha] kaya as Applied to the Remaining ProW lemns" has been in press since 1988, evidencing his sulbscription to the notion for at least the past five years." Further, he explains the term slesa in detail in his article entitled "Pilgrimage as Im- age," which Dehejia cites in her Ars Orientalis essay for other purposes.9 Although I have advocated that multiple mean- ings are simultaneously inherent in many works of Indic art, I do not believe that the theory of muiltivalency that Dehejia proposes offers aviable alternative either to the tradlitional theory of aniconism or to th-e ideas that I am presenting in my own work that challenge the aniconic theory. A carefuil readling of her article reveals that the logic she has used in applying this principle to the early Budldhist artistic remains undermines the credibility of her scheme. She reasons in her first paragraplh that if the technique of double meanings was employed by writers, the concept vould have been known to visual artists and employed by them as well.'0 While this is possi- ble, it cannot be automatically assumed that there is a positive correlation between different media, suclh as literature and the visual arts, in every time an(l place. With regardl to the early Buddhist</page><page sequence="3">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 113 materials one must ask: Were literary techniques that employed double entendre or other multiplic- ities of meaning in vogue (or even in use) at the time the art monuments under discussion were created? And, if they were, can we document linkages between the literary and visual arts dur- ing that period? If Dehejia's multivalent interpre- tations are predicated upon an analogy widt liter- ary techniques, a definite correlation must be found between the media at the tiIme. If she is using the literary analogy to suggest a kind of generalized cultural milieu, then it is necessary that she unequivocally demonstrate the presence of multivalency within the art works themselves. My analysis of her article demonstrates that in a majority of cases (if not all), her proofs of multi- ple meanings are speculative or, if verifiable, do not apply to the degree and in the manner she suggests. Further, even if her interpretation of multivalency could be shown to be valid-and I suggest that it is not-her assertion regarding its importance for the theory of aniconism seems greatly exaggerated. Her claim that "As soon as we accept the validity of such a system [of multi- valency] ... aniconism ceases to be such a vexed problem" (47) vastly oversimplifies the complex religious, social, cultural, and artistic issues sur- rounding the theory of aniconism and, at the same time, fails to offer a new, comprehensive explanation of what is seen-or not seen-in the art. My chief concern regarding Dehejia's applica- tion of the theory of mnutltivalency is that she does not distinguish deliberately intendledl multiple meanings from those that are naturally inherent in certain subjects. If iny reading of Dehejia's article is correct, she is suggesting that the cre- ators of monuments, such as the sti7pas at Safici, Bharhut, and other early Buddhist sites, deliber- ately tried to invest the sculptural compositions with multiple layers of meaning. I contendl that the compositions are intended to show a single, principal meaning but sometimes intrinsically carry with them additional layers of meaning as well. To use a literary analogy, it is easily observe(d that a given word might have a variety of mean- ings. Awriter can employ aword that has mulltiple meanings to convey only one meaning, as in most scientific writing, or can use the word to suggest more than one meaning, as in punning, off-color jokes, poetry, and avariety of other literary forms. The specific characteristics of some languages have enabled writers to master the art of doauble entendre and create highly sophisticated literary forms. Sanskrit authors, inspired by the peculiar- ities of the Sanskrit language that facilitated the creation of simultaneous meanings, developed the literary mode of sle.sa, a deliberate literary mode that was predicated on the singular char- acteristics of the Sanskrit language. Specifically, the rules of Sanskrit grammar require the coales- cence of certain sound combinations, with the result that Sanskrit passages are often written continuously, without spaces between words. To give an examnple in English of how this can be done, one might use the sequence of letters a-t-o- n-e. Depending upon how one breaks up the sequence, one can read the letters as "a tone," "at one," or "atone." Thus, itis easy to see how writers could take advantage of the language to imbue their works with multiple, simultaneous mean- ings." Similarly, punning could be accom- plished simply by choosing words that have alternative meanings.'2 The word hide can mean "the skin of an animal," "to put out of view, "to give a beating to," and is also an old English unit of land area.13 It is important to establish, however, that the potential of a word (or, in Sanskrit, a sequence of letters) to convey more than one meaning does not prove that an author who uses that word intends that more tlhan one of them apply to a particular situation. The word springcan be used by a weather forecaster to refer to the season following winter and by a mattress sales clerk to refer to the support under a mattress, but to conclude that by using the word spring each individual is referring to the variant meanings is simply incorrect. What I believe Dehejia is suggesting about what slhe calls emblems (such as trees, pillars, and stiipas in the art of Sana, Bharhut, and other sites) is that inherently they may have more than one meaning and that these meanings are manifest in early Buddhist art in two ways. These two ways constitute wvhat she calls her "two prerequisites." First, she suggests that individual "emblems" are imbued with muiltiple meanings and function in different contexts with different meanings (45, para. 2 and 3), but she uses neither internal evidence in the reliefs nor external evidence from Buddhological or other sources to verify that the same motif might be intended to convey alternative meanings. Second, she sug- gests that in a single composition, an "emblem"</page><page sequence="4">114 SUSAN L. HUNTINGTON might communicate more than one layer of meaning (45, para. 4).14 This assumes that the individual responsible for the selection of the subject matter in an artistic composition deliber- ately intended to communicate sinmultaneous, multiple meanings and apparently intended that the alternative meanings be given equal or rela- tively equal emphasis.15 However, my research suggests that while additional layers of meanings might be implicit for some subjects, the composi- tions of the early Buddhist artistic repertoire were intended to focus on a principal meaning. I contend that while a representation of lay wor- shipers performing devotions at the site of the Buddha's first sermon is undoubtedly a reminder of the first sermon itself and a reference to it, the actual subject of the scene is still the worship at the site. In other words, I distinguish among a representation, a reminder, and a reference, while Dehejia seems to conflate these discrete notions. To give an example from Western culture, a representation ofa Christmas tree on a Christmnas card is not a representation of the birth of Christ, which is the main event celebrated by Christmas, although it may implicitly refer to it and be a reminder of it. But it also inight not implicitly refer to the birth of Christ either: some people- for example, the many AmericanJews who install Christmas trees in their homes and businesses and send Christmas greeting cards-do not in- tend that the tree refer to the birth of Christ. Indeed, such individuals commonly shrink from the notion of associating their Christmas greet- ings with the event of Christ's birth but instead intend to communicate to their family, friends, and associates simply a celebration of the season and good will. Thus, a multivalency theory should not pre- sume that the same motif (or "emblem") conveys the same meanings throughout its history and in all of its usages. New layers of meanings may have been added over the course of centuries; some may have pertained to certain populations only or may have been used only in certain regions, and others may have been employed in otherwise defined contexts. Without specific study one can- not assume that a motif with potentially multiple layers of meanings had all of those meanings at every period and in every instance of its usage. The task is to study the specific situation to deter- mine which meanings might have been present and which were incorporated into the work by the artists. When I have applied the concept of multivalency to art, I have looked for specific proof that in a given case the artistic intention was to present a duality or a multiplicity of meanings simultaneously.'6 My suggestion that the Maravijaya image in Pala art might have served as a dual image referring to the Pala kings is sup- ported by inscriptional evidence that indicates a widespread convention establishing a metaphor- ic relationship between the Pala kings and the image type.'7 Further, I believe that there is gen- erally, if not always, a principal meaning and that the other meanings are additional. Thus, in my discussion of the popularly portrayed Maravijaya as a dual image referring also to the Pala kings in Pala art, I have no intention of suggesting that the reference to the Pala kings is the principal or even an equivalent subject of the art but rather an additional layer of meaning that has been grafted onto the basic Buddhist image. Nor do I intend to suggest that the same subject, the Maravijaya, appearing in the art of other regions-even those heavily dependent upon the Pala tradition, such as Tibet-was intended to communicate the allu- sion to the Pala kings. Dehejia's interpretation of multiple meanings has led her to apply the principle of multivalency broadly, without proving that the principle is applicable to the cases she cites. Her interpreta- tion fails to discriminate between primary and additional layers of meaning and to distinguish among representations, references, and remind- ers. Furthermore, in her discussion of emblems, she does not explain the sources for the various interpretations she provides for them, nor does she supply the reader with a means of interpret- ing a motif in a given context. I shall discuss these ideas in more detail below. "EMBLEMS" A key term for Dehejia-used both in the title of her article and throughout her presentation-is embleml8 The concept of the emblem is the foun- dation stone of Dehejia's theory of multivalency. However, I believe that the most fundamental flaw in the multivalency theory is the assumption that certain motifs or subjects in the early Bud- dhist art of India necessarily function as em- blems. Dehejia defines an emblem as "a picture that represents something different from itself" (45). By using the term emnblem, she assumes that what she calls "the major Buddhist emblems" of the tree, the pillar, and the stuzpa (and, I assume,</page><page sequence="5">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 115 some of the other subjects she addresses in her article) invariably represent something other than themselves. For traditional aniconists, this other subject is believed to constitute the "real" subject of the scene, namely, an anthropomorphic depic- tion of the Buddha that is absent from the compo- sition. Dehejia modifies the traditional aniconic view and suggests that "emblems" might also refer to "sacred sites" and "attributes" of the Buddhist faith. As with proponents of the anicon- ic theory before her, Dehejia's list of emblems includes only nonfigurative motifs, although, theoretically, there is no reason that a human figure or an animal cannot also serve as an em- blem since the only requirement of "emblem- ness" is that something stand for something other than itself.'9 Dehejia's discussion of emblems is unclear be- cause of the ambiguity with which the relevant emblems are named. Her generalization about multiple meanings is specifically applied to the tree, the pillar, and the stiupa, which she terms "the major Buddhist emblems" (45). However, it is not explained whether this triad is named to exemplify a variety of emblems or to stand as "the three major" emblems in early Buddhist art. If the former, this is not specified; if the latter, evidence to verify that the tree, pillar, and sti-pa are the major emblems is not provided. Therefore, the basis upon which the tree, the pillar, and the stiupa are prioritized over other Buddhist sub- jects, such as the cakra, the footprints, and the throne, is unclear. No literary, inscriptional, or other proof of this prioritization is provided, and it is unlikely that Buddhists and scholars of Bud- dhism would all agree that these three would be paramount among the possibilities in the Bud- dhist repertoire. Furthermore, Dehejia does not specify which tree she considers to be one of the three major emblems, nor does this issue become clear in her subsequent discussions: sometimes "the tree" clearly refers to the bodhi tree, but in other contexts Dehejia broadens the category to include other sacred trees in Buddhism.20 Regardless, I do not understand why nonfigu- rative elements in the compositions, like trees, pillars, and stiipas, might not simply represent themselves. If I were to go to Bodh Gaya today, I would find there a bodhi tree and a temple. These were not installed at the site as substitutes for images of the Buddha but are important Buddho- logical motifs in their own right. If I were to take a picture of the bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya and show it to my friends and relatives at home, I would not say that this is a photograph of a tree that repre- sents the Buddha but that this is a photograph of the tree (or the descendant of the tree) under which the Buddhaattained enlightenment. There- fore, this particular tree is a reminder of the event in the Buddha's life and a reference to it, but it is not a substitute for the event, nor is it a represen- tation of the Buddha. If anything, it is a partici- pant in the event that still remains at the site. Specifically, the tree marks the location of the Buddha's "sitting place" (pi.tha) but does not emblematically depict the Buddha himself. Nor, I argue, is it merely an indicator of the site or simply an "attribute of the faith."2' While it may suggest all of these things, the tree embodies its own meanings as well. Further, as I hope to demonstrate in this article, I suggest that it is incorrect to look at a scene that might contain numerous figures and activities alongwith a motif like a tree or a throne and define the subject matter of the composition according to thatmotif alone. Dehejia's own illustrations and analysis include a number of examples that illustrate my view- point. One relief depicts the story of the serpent king Erapattra (fig. 1 ).22 Dehejia claims that the seat and the garlanded tree at the lower left indicate the emblematic presence of the Buddha, before whom the serpent king kneels in obeisance V/ - Pf'&amp;S1 FIG.

She cites an inscription accompanying the scene, which she transliterates as "ErapatoNa-garazja Bhagavato Vadate" and translates as "Serpent King Erapata adores the Holy One" (48), as evidence. However, the inscription does not prove that "the Holy One"-that is, the Buddha-is represented emblematically by the seat and the tree but only that Erapattra is honoring him. The key term in the inscription is vadate, from the root vand, which has a variety of meanings, including to praise, celebrate, laud, extol, show honor to, do homage to, salute respectfully or deferentially, venerate, worship, adore, to offer anything, and to show honor to anyone.23 The physical presence of the Buddha is not implicitly requiired in most, if not all, of these meanings. In other words, the Buddha can be praised, celebrated, lauded, ex- tolled, have honor shown to him, have homage paid to him, be venerated, worshiped, adored, have offerings made to him, and be shown honor without being physically present. Based on the literary account I have found that most closely corresponds with the Bharhut com- position, I suggest that the seat and the tree simply indicate the Buddha's "sitting place" and are not emblematic of the Buddha.24 While I cannotyet explain why the Buddha is absent from the scene,25 I believe that his absence is simply that-an absence-rather than a presence indi- cated by the seat or the tree. If I am correct, then the seat and the tree are not emblems, and the symbolic/emblematic premise of the multivalen- cy theory, and the aniconic theory as it has been traditionally understood and applied, cannot be supported. Although other examples illustrated by Dehe- jia can be used to demonstrate the idea of the absent Buddha rather than the Buddha indicat- ed by emblems, a scene on one of the gateways at Sanici is especially pertinent (fig. 2). Dehejia and others before her have identified this composition as the Great Departure of the Bud- dha-[to-be], but this may not be the case. In her discussion of this scene, Dehejia questions how what she calls my "pageantry" theory can justify the fact that no Buddha (or, more correctly, Bodhisattva) is seated upon the horse. While the explanation for this scene that I propose provides an answer to this intriguing and important ques- tion, as I shall explain below, I am puzzled as to which emblem is intended to depict the absent Buddha-to-be in this composition. Simply, the horse does not represent the absent figure, nor does the umbrella, which even in so-called iconic depictions of the Buddlha is held above his head. In other words, it is difficult to defend the belief that the Buddha-to-be is indicated here through emblematic means. If the scene depicts the Great Departure, the Buddha-to-be can only be indicat- ed by his absence and not as the equivalent of a nonfigurative symbol. Therefore, the art shows not the "presence" of the Buddha-to-be but his absence.26 I suggest that unless there is specific internal evidence in an artistic composition to demon- strate that nonfigurative motifs are intended to serve as surrogates for something else, we should be cautious and not make this assumption. Alter- natively or additionally, there must be external evidence to demonstrate that early Buddhist art employed such emblems if we are to use this mode of interpretation. However, Dehejia does not explain how she knows the meaning of any of the "emblems" she discusses.</page><page sequence="7">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 117 DEHEJIA'S "THREE VALID CATEGORIES" (OR "THREE VALID AsPECTS") OF EMBLEMS Dehejia explains that the "interpretation of the emblem, with its inherent fluidity of meanings, will be considered under its three valid catego- ries-first as an aniconic presentation of the Buddha, next as a sacred site, and finally as an attribute [of the faith]" (48).27 Except for her brief conclusion (64), the preponderance of her article is devoted to discussion of the emblem under these three aspects (48-64). Although Dehejia claims that these are "three valid catego- ries," itis unclear how their validity is established, nor does the discussion of the works of art rein- force the claim of their validity. Further, it is not apparent from Dehejia's presentation whether these three categories are intended to explain all possible subjects in early Buddhist art or whether there are others as well. If these three categories are intended to cover all contingencies, then I disagree. Even examples cited in Dehejia's own article demonstrate that this is not the case. I would argue, for example, that the two Asokan scenes discussed below are not merely "site" scenes, though the events take place at Buddhist sacred sites. Instead, they might be better classi- fied as historical or quasihistorical narratives in- tended to convey a number of messages to the Buddhist devotee, including, among other things, reverence to the Buddlha and his relics by living beings other than humans in one relief andl a model of benevolent cakravartin-ship in the per- son of Asoka in the other. Most importantly regarding these three categories, althouigh Dehe- jia states that the "exact interpretation of the emblems depends on their visual context" (45), this statement is never clarified, nor is the reader provided with a means of determining the in- terpretation of motifs in individual cases. The Emblem as Aniconic Presence. Under the first "valid category," Dehejia claims that em- blems may denote the aniconic presence of the Buddha. She cites a dictionary meaning of the term aniconic as "symbolizing without aiming at resemblance" and aniconismtias "worship orv ener- ation of an object that represents a god without being an image of him" (45). In an endnote to these definitions, she provides additional mean- ings from other sources. She notes that The Ran- dom House Dictionasy explains aniconism as "op- position to the use of idols" (65 n. 5). Although Dehejia has understandably selected a definition that reinforces her interpretation and applica- tion of the term aniconic, alternative meanings cannot be ignored when examining the ways in which aniconism has been viewed in scholarship. Since th-e traditional aniconic theory has been intimately linked with the idea of a presumed Hinayana prohibition, an historical overview of the theory of aniconism and its abiding interpre- tation in scholarship also must accommodate the definition that cites opposition to the use of idols. Further, the definition of aniconism that Dehejia uses-worship or veneration of an object that represents a god without being an image ofhim- is problematic for today's scholars of Buddhism. At the time the aniconic theory was first pro- posed, Western scholars assumed that the Bud- dha was a god, a factor that may have influenced the choice of the term aniconism to describe what they perceived in Indic art. But, as Helmuth von Glasenapp has since demonstrated, the Buddha was nota god.28Therefore, while Dehejia's choice of a definition for the term aniconic selects an element of aniconism-the use of emblems- that serves the purpose of the theory of multiva- lence she is proposing, other components of the aniconic an(l aniconism should not be ignored in a thorouigh stuidy of the issues. The section of Dehejia's article called "The Aniconic Presence" is predicated on the idea that early Buddhist artistic compositions contain "em- blems" that stand for what should be anthropo- morphic representations of the Buddha (48). However, in the case of the Erapattra relief from Bharhut discussed above, I suggested that the Buddha may be indicated by his absence, not through the use of emblems. A similar case can be made for a relief from Bharhut that shows King Ajatasatru, who is identified in the accompanying inscription, kneeling in a reverential pose before a seat that has a pair of footprints before it and a parasol above (fig. 3). Dehejia states unequivo- cally: "To ensure that the viewer correctly identi- fies the footprints, throne, and parasol as the Buddha, the artist added the label 'Ajaitasatu Bhagavato vamdate,' or 'Ajatashatru bows to the Blessed One'.... It is difficult to misconstrue the artist's intention" (50).29 However, I suggest that the footprints, seat, and umbrella signify the Buddha's "sitting place" and are not emblems substituting for his physical person. If this scene represents King Ajatasatru's visit to the Buddha himself, then I propose that the Buddha's pres- ence is inclicated by his absence. The throne, with its respectful parasol above, would mark</page><page sequence="8">118 SUSAN L. HUNTINGTON IC. F0I ., B.

Photo: Archaeological Survey of India. the Buddha's sitting place, and the footprints below would represent the place for the Bud- dha's feet. The inscription, which Dehejia be- lieves so unambiguously proves that the foot- prints, throne, and parasol represent the Buddha can be as easily interpreted to mean thatAjataeatru bows to honor a being who is not shown. An alternative interpretation may also be of- fered regarding this scene. Since Ajatasatru was converted by the Buddha only a year before the Buddha died, much of the king's devotions to the Buddha took place in the years following the Buddha's death, when the Buddha was no longer present. This scene might show the king venerat- ing a place where the Buddha once sat but after the Buddha was already dead and therefore not to be expected in the composition. In this case as well, the footprints, throne, and parasol would b)e part of the paraphernalia installed at the place of veneration rather than symbols indicating thle Buddha's person. Another example Dehejia uses to illustrate the Buddha's aniconic presence is what she calls the "Enlightenment face of the Prasenajit Pillar" from Bharhut (fig. 4). Dehejia refers to the uppermost of the three panels on this pillar as exemplary of her second prerequisite (in which the "emblem" conveys multiple meanings). She claims that "the prime intention of this panel was to depict the historical event [of the Buddha's enlightenment]" (45) and states unequivocally that the "throne, which is surmounted by triratna emblems and stands beneath the bodhi tree encir- cled by a hypaethral shrine, represents, in this instance, the presence of the enlightened Bud- dha" (50). Yet she is apparently also persuaded by the arguments I have proposed suggesting that this scene represents worship at the site of Bodh Gaya at a time after the enlightenment of the Buddha, for she offers a "site" interpretation of the scene as well.30 However, whereas I believe that the worship at the site is the principal theme of the relief, she claims that it is primarily a depiction of the event of the Buddha's enlighten- ment. A key difference between our interpreta- tions centers on the translation of the inscrip- tion, "Bhagavato sakamunino bodho," which she interprets as "enlightenment of the Holy One Sakyamuni" (50). I believe, however, that the term bodhomay denote the tree and not the event of the enlightenment.3' Based on an examination of the narrative elements in the composition and this inscription, I suggest that the scene shows devotees (at a time subsequent to the Buddha's enlightenment) indicating their reverence to the sacred place of the event and the sacred tree underwhich the Buddhaattained enlightenment. While Dehejia claims that the Buddha is indicat- ed emblematically by the tree, I propose that the throne marks the location where the Buddha sat beneath the tree and that the tree represents itself. To explain the depiction of the building, which, as far as is known from archaeological and textual sources, was not present at the time of the Bud- dha's enlightenment, Dehejia suggests that the artists who created dtis panel may have been unaware that a portrayal of a building erected after the time of the event might be anachronistic in a representation of the event itself. She cites what she considers to be a parallel example from the sixteenth century, but a theoretical analogy does not offer proof for the Bharhut case. Fur- ther, the major basis for the interpretation of the scene as a depiction of the sacred site is the presence of the building. Then to argue that the building is there because the composition is a</page><page sequence="9">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 119 depiction of a site seems to be circular reasoning. I suggest that a post-enlightenment structure is depicted because a post-enlightenment scene is intended. The central and lower panels on the same face of this pillar show two other compositions nor- mally associated with the Buddha's enlighten- ment. The central panel shows four groups of gods, separated, as Dehejia says, by the "composi- tional device of a tree" (51). The criteria for determining that the tree is not an emblem in this case are not specified. Inscriptions accompany- ing the scene name the groups of gods as beings from northern, eastern, and southern quarters, with those from the western quarter presumably also included, although an inscription for this group is lacking (50-51).32 Dehejia states that these beings came to honor the enlightened Buddha (51 and 66 n. 22)," although at least one textual source records that they came prior to the enlightenment in order to help weaken Mara.34 The figure at the lower left of the composition is Mara, sitting beneath a tree and writing in the ground.35 Whether the gods are there to help defeat Mara or to honor the newly enlightened Buddha,36 I propose that the composition does not require the presence of a Buddha image. Instead, I suggest that the scene is not th-e Bud- dha's enlightenment but rather just what it ap- pears to be and just what its inscriptions suggest: it is the representation of the role played by the celestial beings in this momentous event. If a camera had been present at the time of the Buddha's enlightenment, this scene might show what the camera would have found if it had turned to pan the audience. I suiggest that these beings are immortalized in the artistic composi- tion for their role as supporters and devotees of the Buddha. The emphasis on these figures cor- relates with textual sources, such as the Lalitavist- ara, which contains a lengthy and detailed de- scription of the role of the devas, although it might be overlooked by those concerned prima- rily with what was happening to the Buiddha.37 The lower panel on this pillar shows female musicians and dancers, who, accordling to Dehe- jia, arrive at the site of the enlightenment to honor the Buddha (51).38 As she notes, four of the inscriptions accompanying this scene identi- fy four of the figures as specifically named apsara- sas. She claims that a fifth inscription reads: "music of the gods enlivened by mimic dance" (51).39 There are no motifs in the scene that can }~~~~~~~~'. * ij. I. I Face" of LPrasenajit Pillar."

Huntington. be construed as emblems, and I propose that the subject matter be interpreted literally, based on the internal information contained in the in- scriptions and visual composition. These tell us only that the apsarasas are dancing and perform- ing music. To use the camera analogy again, it is as if the camera had now panned to the orchestra and performers. And, while the occasion for dancing and singing may have been the remark- able transformation from Bodhisattva to Buddha that Sakyamuni was undergoing, I suggest that the figures are shown as important devotees in their own right, like the devas in the scene above it. Taken together, what do the three panels on this face of the so-called Prasenajit pillar commu- nicate? Dehejia discusses these scenes as part of her "Aniconic Presence" theme and summarizes her interpretation in this way: "The three panels on this face of the Prasenajit panel [sic for pillar] thus represent simultaneous events; they pertain to the enlightenment of the Buddha, as pro- claimed by the inscription in the topmost panel, in which the Buddha's presence is indicated by aniconic emblems. Read thus, the presence of the gods of the four directions and of the heaven- ly apsaras becomes meaningfuil" (51). (The read- er is left to infer how the presence of the gods and the heavenly apsarasas become meaningful.) However, I propose that the upper scene shows two pairs of devotees offering their veneration at the place where the Buddha sat, meditated, de- feated Mara, and became enlightened and that this devotion takes place after the time of the Buddha's enlightenment. The two lower panels are also devotional scenes, but, in these, celestial beings offer their celebrations to the Buddha. Together, these reliefs reinforce the theme of devotion to the Buddha by his followers that I suggest is an important message of early Buddhist art. While the central event being celebrated is the most momentous event of the Buddha's life and one of the most important subjects in Bud- dhism-Sakyamuni's enlightenment-it is the celebrators, not the Buddha, who constitute the subject of these particular works of art. Dehejia identifies a small relief found in recent excavations in the Swat region of Pakistan as an aniconic representation of the Buddha's descent from Trayastrinima Heaven at Sankasya (fig. 5). Extrapolating from my interpretation of a relief from Blharhut, which traditionally has been iden- tified as the Buddha's Descent at Sankasya (fig. 6) but which I believe depicts a worship scene at</page><page sequence="11">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 121 Sarikasya,40 Dehejia assumes that I would apply the same interpretation to this Swat relief. She says that "Those who deny the existence of ani- conism4' would see the ladders as the actual set of stairs set up at the pilgrimage site of Sankissa" (53).42 However, while both the Bharhut and Swat compositions apparently refer to the Bud- dha's descent at Sarikasya, tlhey may represent completely different themes. The one from Swat might show the event (with the Buddha miss- ing) ,4' but the other, from Bharhut, does not. In the Bharhut carving, rows of devotees circumam- bulate the ladders and hold their hands in anijali mudra as an expression of their devotion, and I contend for the reasons presented in my article that thatscene represents the holysite of Sanikasya, with devotees honoring the site." If this is true, the two reliefs would convey completely different messages, one of which might relate to the Bud- dha life event, the other to the commemoration and celebration of that event and the place where it occcurred. As Dehejia observes, Indra and Brahma are depicted in the Swat relief, but the two Vedic gods are absent from the Bharhut composition. Be- cause the aniconic theory has never been extend- ed to include beings other than the Buddlha, Dehejia recognized the need to provide an expla- nation for the absence of these two figures, who are crucial to the narrative of the Buddha's de- scent. She proposes that the absence of the Vedic gods, which she terms an avoidance, is "to be seen in the context of Hindu worship which, in the Vedic period, was concerned only with sacrifice and in which images of the gods played no part" (66 n. 27). She goes on: "Few early images of Hindu deities exist. Itwas mainly with the spread of Puranic Hinduism that images of the Hindu gods proliferated" (66 n. 27). But Dehejia creates avery serious problem for her argument with this explanation. First, she associates the art ofBharhut with the Vedic period, which concluded more than half a millennium before the Bharhuit stfipa carvings were created. Second, she implies that Vedic practices regarding the use of images, whether she is correct in her claims or not, had some bearing on a Buddhist monument. Since Buddhism reflects a thoroughly non-Vedic reli- gious system-many might even say an anti-Vedic system-it is doubtful that the Vedic situation is pertinent here. While it is true that Indra and Brahma are Vedic gods, their appearance, or lack of appearance, in Buddhist art cannot be expected to be governed by the rules of Vedism. Their subservient role in Buddhism-primarily as attendants to the Buddha-makes it clear that their status has been transformed from thatwhich they enjoyed in Vedism. Further, Dehejia's argu- ment that it was only with the spread of Purarnic Hinduism that images of the Hindu gods prolif- erated seems to be almost a Hindu equivalent of the Buddhist aniconic theory-in the Buddhist case, the earlier aniconic tradition of the Hinayanists was supposed to have been supplant- ed by the later Mahayana image tradition; in the Hindu case, she implies that the earlier Vedic lack of imagery was replaced by the imagery of the Puranic Hindu tradition. Since there is a decided lack of early imagery for both Buddhism and Hinduism (and injainism as well) even when the religions already flourished, I propose that there might be other reasons for the apparent lack of early images.45 My interpretation of the Bharhut panel offers a far more plausible explanation for the absence of Indra and Brahma in the composition. If the scene shows worship at the site of Sankasya after the time of the Buddha life event, then it is unnecessary to include a depiction of the Bud- dha (who was no longer there), and there is no need to include the figures of the two Vedic gods who accompanied him on his descent. It is only when the composition is viewed as a representa- tion of the event itself that the absence of Indra and Brahma becomes problematic.46 Dehejia then querieswhy arelief from Mathura (fig. 7) that has the Buddha along with Indra and Brahma is "unhesitatingly accepted as a life scene . . . [when] Xuanxang's [sic for Xuanzang's] account of the site of Sankissa speaks of an image atop the steps. Why is it suddenly assumed that 'depictions of events of the life of the Buddha... became commonplace' at the precise stage when the iconic replaces the aniconic?" (53) .4 A care- ful look at the Mathura relief reveals that the Buddha is present in each of the life scenes depicted on this panel. The context of the de- scent vignette among a set of five Buddha life scenes, all shown with Buddhas, in a single com- position offers compelling evidence that the ep- isode represents a Buddha life event. I suggest that Dehejia is looking indiscriminately at a number of compositions that have been tradi- tionally identified as representing one subject (in this case, the Buddha's descent), and, by ignoring the many distinctions among these</page><page sequence="12">122 SUSAN L HUNTINGTON - ~ _-U_ -5 *Tf.&gt; *. i- -r @Rj_ t -~~~a seon century .'.

The defense of aniconism is stretched in Dehe- jia's discussion of two reliefs from the Bactro- Gandhar region (figs. 8 and 9). Figure 8 is a depiction of the Buddha's first sermon in which a seated Buddha reaches out a hand as if to turn a wheel. Dehejia claims that such a representa- tion, aside from indicating the action of the Buddha turning the wheel of the law as he is said to have done with his first sermon, "may also be understood as the anthropomorphic Buddha giv- ing his sanction to the earlier homage paid to the wheel-topped pillar" (55).48 She reasserts this claim for figure 9, showing a standing Buddha touching or pointing to a pillar topped by three wheels, and concludes by saying that "Those who believe in the primacy of emblems may suggest that the anthropomorphic figure derives its valid- ity from the earlier established emblem!" (55). But Dehejia provides no evidence to support the assertion that the Buddha is "giving his sanction to the earlier homage paid to the wheel-topped pillar" in figure 9. For figure 8, what is the ratio- nale for saying that the actual Buddha perform- ing his sermon is gaining validity from the em- blem? Is Dehejia suggesting that he is gaining validity from the emblem that symbolizes his first sermon but only became an emblem symbolizing his first sermon after the first sermon itself? What is the evidence that justifies these proposals in 44 FIG. 9 (Dehejia fig. 11). Buddha Touching or Pointing to a Wheel-topped Pillar. From Bacto-Gandhgra region. Ca. second-third century C.E. Private Collection,Japan. Photo: Martha Carter. terms of Buddhist practice, literature, or other sources? From what evidence are these ideas drawn, and how are they supported? I suggest that figure 9 depicts a Buddha point- ing to a wheel-topped pillar that has been erect- ed, perhaps to honor the place where a sermon had been given.49 He is accompanied by monk devotees at the left and Vajrapani at the right, while flying celestials hover above. Figure 8 prob- ably shows a literal rendering of the Buddha's turning of the wheel of law. The claim that the Buddha is here gaining his validity from the emblem is unsubstantiated and, as far as I can determine, does not make sense either Buddho- logically or in relation to the artistic develop- ments of the period. As an aside, Dehejia identifies the configura- tion in figure 9 as a triratna While this configura- tion shares a visual resemblance to the triratna form that she illustrates (compare with fig. 17, Dehejia's fig. 22), the triratna component is ab- sent in this composition, and I suggest that the configuration depicts a pillar topped by a capital that has a design incorporating three wheels. The assertion (55) that the. form refers to the Bud- dha, the Dharma, and the Samgha (the tradition- al interpretation of the tnratna) is therefore un- tenable. Because three wheels are shown rather than the triratna, it is more plausible that they are intended to suggest three teachings, or three levels of teachings, or something else pertaining to the number three and potentially conveyed by the wheel. Further developing the theme of the "Aniconic Presence," Dehejia claims thatwhile the artists of the Bharhut and Sanci monuments portrayed simple, and often single, emblems, the Amaravati artists used a series of emblems combined to build up an "emblematic body" (55)50 for the Buddha. She illustrates a composition that shows a crowd of figures surrounding a central throne with a number of accoutrements (fig. 10). But upon what basis is the extraordinary suggestion made in the interpretation of the subject of this composition that the Buddha's feet are repre- sented by the footprints (this is the most plausible of the equations); that his limbs are represented by the cushioned throne (how is it determined that it was not his buttocks that was represented by the throne?); that his torso is represented by the pillar [of radiance]; and that his head is equivalent to the triratna above? What is the foundation for this interpretation? Where is</page><page sequence="14">124 SUSAN L. HUNTINGTON FIG. 10 (Dehejia fig. 12). Buddhist Devotional Scene. From AmarivatT, Andhra Pradesh, India.

Why is this not another example, like those discussed above, of the Buddha's throne and its accoutrements being shown not as em- blems of the physical person of the Buddha but rather as part of the setting of the scene? The Emblems of the Tree, the Pillar, and the Supa as a Sacred Site. The second of the "valid categories" concerns the depiction of sacred spots and the devotions performed at them (56-61).51 Dehejia says that in "their second aspect, the em- blems of the tree, pillar, and stiupa, seen in relief sculptures, may represent sacred spots, or tirthas,52 and the devotions perfonned there. Thus, the bodhi tree may be intended to represent Bodh Gaya, site of the enlightenment; the wheel-crowned pillar may represent Sarnath, site of the first sermon; and the stupa may represent one of the sacred relic mounds built at a variety of sites" (45). 53 Dehejia discusses two reliefs at Sancd that de- pict the EmperorMoka's visits at Buddhist sacred sites (figs. 11 and 12).54 The first composition shows avisit by Emperor Asoka and his entourage to the bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya; the second scene shows his visit to the Ramagrama stfipa Although Dehejia does notspecifically state this, the premise of her article and the subheading for this section of her text imply that she would interpret the bodhi tree and/or the building in the center ofthe Bodh Gaya scene and the stuipa in the Rama- grama scene as emblems standing for something else, presumably the sites of Bodh Gaya and Ramagrama, respectively. However, I suggest that these subjects do not serve emblematic roles in these scenes: they are major "actors" in the narra- tives and, therefore, represent themselves and not something else. With respect to the Bodh Gaya depiction, the Asokavad&amp;na makes it clear thatMokawas visiting the tree when he went to Bodh Gaya and not a Buddha in the form of a tree or as symbolized by a tree-and I see no justification for reading additional layers of meaning into the tree in the Asokavadana or in an artistic composition such as this.55 The only other possible motif that might serve as a nonfigurative emblem in this composi- tion is the building and its altar. But if Dehejia would claim that the building with its altar serves &gt;1 ~~~~~~~~~~~ II. 11 (Dehejia fig. 14). Emperor AMoka's Visit to the Bodhi Tree at Bodh Gaya during the Quinquennial Festival.

I suggest that it is included because it was present at the site at the time of Asoka's visit and was an important element in the Agokan theme. Dehejia claims that the building was not present at the time of this visit by AMoka, citing a passage (57) in the Asokavadaina where Asoka is said to have "mounted a platform that he had had built on all four sides of the Bodhi tree."56 She interprets this statement about the platform to mean that there was no shrine present at the time Asoka lustrated the tree. However, the mention of a platform at the base of the tree does not preclude the simul- taneous existence of a building. In fact, the se- quence of events recorded in the Asokiivadaina reveals that on an earlier visit (his first visit) to Bodh Gaya, Asoka had built a "caitya" there.57 Since the term caitya can refer to a building associated with a sacred relic, such as a bodhi tree, it is possible-even likely-that the building shown in the relief is a caitya and, specifically, the very one built by Asoka.58 Dehejia identifies the event depicted in the Sanfci reliefas Asoka bathing the bodhi tree due to his desire to revive the tree after it had been cursed by Asoka's chief queen, Tisyaraksita. She does not cite the source for the version of the story she uses to explain the scene, but her cita- tion about the platform from which the bodhi tree could be watered occurs on page 266 of Strong's translation of the Asokavadaina. On the preceding page, the section heading clarifies that the event she notes was part of the Quinquennial Festival, duringwhich AMoka presented the Buddhist com- munity with all of his property except his state treasury and promised to bathe the bodhi tree with milk, which he then did. Dehejia has, there- fore, somehow confused the Quinquiennial Festi- val with the Tisyaraksita story.59 Dehejia may have been following Foucher, who cites the version of the Tisyaraksita story in the Divyavadana, which relates that the tree was re- vived by Asoka after his wife tried to kill it.60 But if she is relying on the Divyazvadaina for one portion of her interpretation-that is, for the story-how can the Asokakvadana-and a different story-be used to decide whetherabuilding should orshould not be present in the composition? Regardless, it is clear that the tree and the building are impor- tant elements in the story rather than emblems. Indeed, the centrality of the tree and structure indicate their preeminence as foci of devotion in their own right and not as emblems. The second Asokan composition referred to by Dehejia (57) depicts Asoka's visit to Ramagrama stuipa (fig. 12).61 After the Buddha's cremation, his relics were divided into eight portions, and one portion was given to each of the eight kings of the time. Each portion was considered to be a drona (literally, a bucket[ful]). Each king then built a stiupa over these relics. These stipas were called drona stiupas (because of the drotia mea- surement and also because a brahman named Drora had performed the division of the relics). Additional stiupas were erected over the bucket that had been used for measuring the relics and over the embers of the cremation fire. At some point, the drona stupa that had been built at Ramagramawas supposedly flooded by the Gang- es River, and the relics were swept down to the underwater palace of a naga king. There, the nagas not only worshiped the relics but did so in such a grand fashion that when Asoka came to Ramagrama to retrieve this portion of the relics, he was convinced to allow the nagas to retain possession of them.62 The composition at Sanc shows a stitpa in the center, with a group of naigas on the left appearing in devotional poses. To the right of the stfipa, a human king, presumably Asoka, arrives in his horse-drawn chariot with his entourage, apparently with the aim of retrieving the relics. A %~~~~~~~~~~~. FiG. 12.

Huntington.</page><page sequence="16">126 SUSAN L HUNTINGTON Like Asoka's visit to Bodh Gaya for the Quin- quennial Festival, this composition seems a straightforward illustration of a story that is re- corded in literature in a forthright fashion and is not characterized by multiple meanings.63 I sub- mit that the stuipa is intended as a representation of the actual structure that had been erected to house the Buddha's relic, rather than as an em- blem, and therefore serves as part of the narra- tive. Simply, the scene does not include an em- blem, and it is not multivalent. Dehejia's classification of the two Asokan scenes under her "Sacred Sites" category does not do justice to their Buddhological content. Although I authored the sacred site idea and am pleased that she applies it in constructing her own theory (albeit without direct acknowledgment of my work), I do not feel that these Asokan scenes are explainable solely as sacred site images. Their message is something greater. Of course, Bodh Gaya and Ramagrama are sacred sites, but much more is implied by the scenes. One message behind the selection of these subjects may have been to show a paradigmatic king demonstrating the way to honor the Buddha through his relics at the sacred sites.64 Strong notes regarding the Ramagrama story that the emphasis in the Asokavadiana is "at least nominally on the value of devotion to the relics, whether it be the devotion ofAsoka or of the nagas."65 The two compositions at Sana showing Asokan themes portray his rev- erence for the relics and are a paradigmatic demonstration of the highest level of lay worship. As Strong explains, one of Asoka's most impor- tant actions was to redistribute the Buddha's relics into 84,000 stu1pas, which, I might add, reflects the desire to make them more accessible to devotees.66 It was after this act that he was no longer called Asoka-the-Fierce but Dharmas'oka.67 Such an analysis melds perfectly with the evi- dence I have offered regarding the importance of relics in Buddhism." That such a composition is illustrated adorning a monument that is itself a stiupa-a stipa founded by Asoka and almost cer- tainly housing a portion of the relics retrieved from the other seven drotza stupas-may not be coincidental. These two scenes do not contain emblems; rather, the tree shrine and the Ramagrama stuipa seem to serve as themselves in the narrative and not as surrogates. If the Bodh Gaya tree shrine and the Ramagrama stupa are intended to indi- cate their respective sites, they do so as both key elements in each narrative and as participants in the story, not as symbols. I see little reason to bring in a discussion of multivalency-or of ani- conism-in the interpretation of these two com- positions. Further, to distill the content of the scenes, with their emphasis on Atoka's activities on behalf of Buddhism, to simple representa- tions of sacred sites indicated by a tree or a stuipa fails to acknowledge the underlying message of piety and devotion expressed by these narratives. Dehejia's discussion of her figures 15, 16, and 17 (figs. 13, 14, and 15, respectively) corrobo- rates the theories I have proposed, particularly in my ArtJournalarticle. She notes that some reliefs show the stupa and the pillar as memorials erect- ed at sacred pilgrimage sites and that in these cases the stiupaand the pillar69 do not indicate the presence of the Buddha.70This section is illustrat- ed by a relief at Sanaci showing the worship of a stiupa by people dressed in non-Indian garb (fig. 13), which I published in Art of Ancient India with the same interpretation;7' a relief that she identi- fies as showing Sarnath due to the presence of a wheel-topped pillar being worshiped by people and the presence of deer below (fig. 14); and a FIG. 13 (Dehejia fig. 15).

Because her interpretation derives from mine, it follows that I am in general agreement with this portion of Dehejia's discus- sion. However, while Dehejia interprets the stiupa in figure 13, the wheel-topped pillar in figure 14, and the bodhi tree and temple in figure 15 as emblems, I contend-unless it can be shown otherwise-that they are simply depicted as them- selves, as any other landmarks or sacred foci of a site might be. While discussing these three compositions (figs. 13-15), Dehejia addresses a point I made in my ArtJournal article, although she misunderstands the implications of my remark. In summarizing my proposal that many of the so-called aniconic compositions are worship scenes at Buddhist sites, I state that these scenes express concepts central to the practice of Buddhism during the period of the creation of the art works, "particularly relat- ing to the exaltation of lay worship."72 Delejia takes issue with the emphasis on lay worship as opposed to worship by monks at sacred sites (58- FiG. 14 (Dehejia fig. 16). Devotion at a Wheel-topped Pillar at Sarnath. On south gateway of Sttlpa I at SriicT, Madhya Pradesh, India. Ca. second-third decade of first century C.E. Photo: American Institute of Indian Studies. 59). However, she develops the idea beyondwhat I stated or intended. I do not believe thatworship of the Buddha's relics was the exclusive domain of lay worshipers and have never claimed nor intended to claim that the clergy did not practice veneration of the relics.73 But I do maintain that the many artistic renderings of devotion to rel- ics-seen in the reliefs from Sianci, Bharhut, and related sites-show lay worshipers, not clergy. In fact, monks and nuns are conspicuously absent in this artistic repertoire. When I write in my Art Journal article that "Further, the scene is clearly an exaltation of Buddhist devotion, specifically lay devotion, since the figures are lay worshipers, as indicated by their secular garb,"74 I am not excluding monastic worship at Buddhist sites-I am merely explaining what is portrayed in the art. When I suggest that the message of these partic- ular monuments, as envisioned by the artists, patrons, and donors, emphasized lay worship, this does not mean that the contemporaneous religious practices did not include the veneration of relics by the clergy.

HUNNTINGTON worship alone should be highlighted by those who wish to explain emblematic reliefs as portray- als of pilgrimage sites" (58) is followed by an endnote number. From the sentence, it might be expected that the endnote would contain a refer- ence to "those" who "wish to explain." Instead, without citing me, her note refers to my state- ment that the "emphasis on sacred p1.thas and pilgrimage to them in Buddhism has neverwaned" (66n. 37).75 Not only is she apparently unaware of the extensive artistic evidence that proves this point, which I will discuss in detail in my book, but she assumes that proof for something in Buddhist practice would be manifest in the art-and the surviving art at that.76 But are we to understand that Gandhara, Ajanta, and the Gupta monu- ments-which Dehejia names-represent all of Buddhism and its art and that what is manifest in other artistic traditions constitutes aberrations? A glance at the history of Buddhism documents what I have said quite thoroughly.77 Why repre- sentations of lay worship of trees, pillars, and stipas do not occur prominently in Gandhara, at Ajanta, or on Gupta monuments I cannot at this point say, although I contend that these artistic traditions emphatically do incorporate lay wor- shipers, who, though usually very tiny, frequiently appear as devotees in Buddhist reliefs.78 In the same note, Dehejia changes the suibject again and quotes my ArtJoumnal article, claiming that I take a "less rigid stand on aniconism" in one ofmy endnotes. While I reserve the right to change my stand in the future-as any good scholar and ethical human being should-I repeat what I have stated before in this article: I have never said that there are no aniconic images. I have only argued that the aniconic theory is inadequate as a single, all-embracing theory to explain the art of early Buddhism. Clearly, there is much more oc- curfing in the art than simple avoidance of Bucl- dha images. Even Dehejia's own work, which ac- cepts that there are stories about Asoka, that there are representations of sites, jatakas, and other subjects not focusing on the life of the Buddha, demonstrates that not all of the art requires an aniconic or life-of-the-Buddha explanation. What I stated in my endnote about the possibility that there might be some aniconic compositions does notrepresenta change in the position I propose in the body of my text; it is a statement abouit wlhat my future research might discover. Although Dehejia maintains it is strange that lay worship is highlighted by those ex- plaining emblematic reliefs as pilgrimage sites, she recognizes the fact that so many of the reliefs do show lay worshipers. But her explanation of the prevalence of lay worshipers in these compo- sitions is unsatisfying. She says: "These depictions of lay worship may have occurred by chance in the course of portraying, on each monument, no more than six to eight scenes of worship" (58- 59). While I disagree with her number, 79 it is more important to ask whether it is defensible to argue that such depictions may have occurred by chance. If the creation of these subjects is a matter of chance, then could it be "by chance" that the Buddha image is absent in the scenes she identifies as demonstrating the Buddha's anicon- ic presence? In other words, a position must be taken on whether the elements included in the artistic renderings are there by choice (whether it is the choice of the artist, the patron, or some other authority) or by chance. I prefer to begin with the premise that the works of art and the elements they include reflect deliberate choices unless proved otherwise. And Dehejia does not prove otherwise; the popularity of the lay wor- shiper motif in itself seems to be evidence that it was intentionally included. Concomitantiy, the scarcity of clergy in the scenes must reflect a choice on the part of the makers. If Dehejia is implying that the depictions of lay worshipers represent the chance survival of some reliefs, I maintain that it is still puzzling that among the hundreds of surviving examples there is an ap- parent lack of compositions representing the clergy. While agreeing that sacred places are impor- tant, Dehejia says that "it is questionable whether, in the early Buddhist ethos, pilgrimage to tirthas ever took priority over the life of the Buddha80 and, equally, whether artistic depictions of pil- grimage sites took precedence over portrayals of events from tlhe life of the Buddha" (56). If she is referring to mywork, and I assume this is the case, let me clarify my point. I have said that "I suggest that the early Buddhist art of India was not prima- rily concerned with the biography of Sakyamuni Buddha,"8' but this is not the same as claiming that artistic depictions of pilgrimage sites took precedence over portrayals of events from the life of the Buddha. By suggesting that life scenes of Sakyamuni Buddlha are not the primary subject matter of the early Buddhist art, I have not im- plied that scenes depicting sacred sites are the most important. As the reader of tlis article will see, I believe that there are a number of subjects in the early Buddhist art of India, which include</page><page sequence="19">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 129 but are not restricted to sacred "site" scenes and what Dehejia calls "pageantry" scenes. But I stand by my claim that, counting these varieties of subjects, those thatare clearly and solely scenes of the Buddha's life events are in a minority, if they exist in any numbers at all. As proof for her statement, Dehejia writes that "Asoka's pilgrimage emphasized the physical form in which the Buddha had lived the life that was being experienced, not merely the sanctity ac- quired by the site of an event" (56).82 But the Asokavadana suggests another interpretation, for it records that when Asoka decides to undertake his pilgrimage, he is said to have fallen at the feet of the elder Upagupta and said: "Elder, I want to honor the places where the Blessed One lived, and mark them with signs as a favor to posteri- ty. "83 That the events and the Buddha's physical presence are an important part of a site, its history, and ambiance is undeniable. But this does not change what I believe is being shown in much of the art. People who live after the time of the Buddha cannot see him at the sacred sites associated with him, nor can they witness the events of his life; they can only get as close to the Buddha as possible by being at the place where the events occurred, and especially being in the presence of his bodily relics. It is always a substi- tute but a necessary one. Dehejia says that the eyewitness accounts of those beings who saw the Buddha "stress the person of the Buddlha and his charismatic qualities" (56). I do not dispute this, but when she concludes from this premise that "Even in a pilgrimage cycle, the emphasis is on the desire to experience the Buddha himself in all his glory" (56), then I question this leap of logic. That is, although there are "eyewitness" accounts describing the glorious physical being that was the Buddha, it is difficult to understand how those accounts can be used to draw conclu- sions about the nature of pilgrimage cycles. As has become clear from the many studies that have recently emerged on the practice of religious pilgrimage, the purposes of pilgrims are general- ly multifaceted. While the ostensible purposes might include the "desire to experience the Bud- dha himself in all his glory,"84 this seems far too simplistic an explanation for a complicated cul- tural phenomenon. Dehejia's statement almost seems to argue against her position since any individual who went on a Buddhist pilgrimage to a site where the Buddha had once been and expected to see the Buddha there would be disap- pointed. What they would find would be relics or reminders, such as the bodhi tree. Indeed, this is precisely my point: the Buddha is gone, but the places (and the relics and monuments at them) preserve something of his presence. Dehejia then moves to the statement that "It is difficult to sustain the argument that early Bud- dhist artists and devotees were not primarily con- cerned with the biography of the Buddha" (56- 57). I suggest that early Buddhist artists and devotees were probably very concerned with the biography of the Buddha, but the scenes that I discussed in my ArtJournalarticle do not show the biography of the Buddha; they show people be- ing concerned with the biography of the Buddha, if you will. Any comments I have made about the relative importance of the life of ;akyamuni in the art should not be misconstrued to mean that I do not believe in the Buddha's centrality to the Buddhist religion. My analysis is intended to describe only what is visible in the surviving art works under discussion. Two sculptures from Amaravatf depict images of Buddhas installed as objects of worship at what may be sacred sites (her figs. 20 and 21, discussed on 60). The first of these compositions formed an important basis of my ArtJournalarticle and was crucial to my comments regarding time and place (fig. 16).5 The second relief, known today only from a drawing, shows a similar subject (Dehe- jia's fig. 21) .86 Dehejia says that the sculptures are "noticed here as possible representations of wor- ship at local sites" (60), but she does not clarify how this relates to her theory of multivalency or how it relates to the theory that rejects aniconism as an all-embracing explanation for the early art of India. In the "Sites" subsection of her text she explains neither the implications of local site worship nor the idea of showing a representation of an image that was being venerated at such a local site. She says that "Since the Amaravati stiipa railing itself is renowned for its circular carved medallions, the scene appears to represent a local site where one such medallion was wor- shipped" (60). These two thoughts do not fol- low.87 Dehejia expresses concern over the depiction of footprints beneath the throne in the Amara- vati sculpture. Elsewhere in her text, she claims that the depiction of footprints in the Bharhut panel that I identify as showing a worship scene at the site of Sanikasya (fig. 6) and in the Swat panel (fig. 5) are substitutes for a Buddha image (53). She claims that "the portrayal of footprints in place of the bodily image can only suggest a</page><page sequence="20">130 SUSAN L HUNTINGTON 40~~~~~~~ '.4 ' - 4 6 3 1 ~~~t o 31 9~, I 41~~~ FiG. 16 (Dehejia fig. 20).

The basis for this suggestion is not explained. Is this assumption drawn from Buddhological, inscriptional, literary, or other evidence? And if the problem of the presence of footprints can be dismissed so easily here, in a scene that clearly does not require a Buddha figure since it includes an image of a Buddha, how then can Dehejia be so stringent in her puzzlement over the presence of footprints in other compositions, such as the two so-called "Descent" scenes from Swat and Bharhut (53)? In her discussion of these two Amaravati re- liefs, Dehejia then citesJain evidence regarding the installation of plaques on thrones beneath trees (60-61). However, she does not clarify the date of theJain evidence nor its implications for the study of early Buddhist art. She concludes this section by saying that "Further studies may clarify the exact significance of these two intriguing site- related portrayals" (61). Here, it seems, she has chosen to ignore my work. The Emblems of the Tree, the Pillar, and the Stiipa as an Attribute [of the Faith].88 Dehejia's use of the term attribute, which is the basis of her third "valid" category, is not explained in her text. Does Buddhism have attributes? If so, what constitutes an attribute? Her explanation that "Not infrequently, the main intention of the artist depicting a pillar, tree, or stiipa was to emphasize the Buddhist truth to which it attests" (63) does not substantiate an equation between a Buddhist truth and an attribute. Dehejia states that sometimes "the tree89 is intended to recall the divine wisdom of the Buddha, while the pillar suggests his sacred doctrine" (45) .90 She explains that the stiupa may not be the great decease nor a sacred stiipa site but rather the Buddha's achieve- mentin finally severing the bonds of rebirth (63). How is it known specifically that "the tree" is meant to recall the divine wisdom of the Buddha? And, assuming that the (bodht) tree is intended to recall the Buddha's divine wisdom, can the Bud- dha's wisdom be categorized as an "attribute"? Some would say that it is the very essence of the religion. Upon what basis is it surmised that the pillar suggests the Buddha's sacred doctrine? Wouldn't the meaning of a pillar depend in part at least upon the motifs with which it is decorat- ed? And should the Buddha's doctrine be charac- terized simply as an "attribute of the faith"? How</page><page sequence="21">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 131 FIG. 17 (Dehejia fig. 22). Devotion to Triratna From Bactro-Gandhara region. Ca. second-third century C.E. Peshawar Museum. Photo: Peshawar Museum. is it known that the stiupa represents the Buddha's severance of the bonds of rebirth? Is there textu- al, inscriptional, or other evidence to document these speculations? In what context are these ideas supported Buddhologically, and how is it known that they apply during the period under discussion? A statement that the equivalents cited are true does not make them so. As examples of artistic renderings that she believes depict Buddhist attributes, Dehejia re- fers to the "emblems" carved on the "dies" or blocks between the architraves and on the up- rights between the architraves of the Saficr torattas.9' Without further explanation, it is diffi- cult to understand how these representations might have a different purpose than, for exam- ple, the one Dehejia illustrates as her figure 17 (fig. 15). She further notes that "due to their capacity for multiple references, emblems in- tended to indicate the attributes of the Buddhist faith also serve to remind the viewer of the Bud- dha himself and the site with which an attribute is associated" (63). But how are we to know when and where the emblem means what? Dehejia illustrates only two sculptures under the category of emblems as attributes of the faith. The first (her fig. 22, discussed on 63) shows the worship of the triratna (fig. 17). This carving is a Kus3na-period work from the Bactro-Gandhara region and is not representative of the early Buddhist art at sites like San-c and Bharhut; its implications for the earlier artistic tradition un- der discussion are unclear. Dehejia discusses the tniratna as a Buddhist emblem referring to the "three jewels of Buddhism," that is, the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Samgha. While the triratnds principal meaning may be a reference to the triple gem of Buddhism, it is shown in this com- position in a way that does not differ materially from the ways that trees, stuipas, and other motifs are sometimes used in the art of Bharhut, Safic, and other early sites. Installed as an object of devotion that is being revered, in this case by members of the clergy, this representation de- picts not merely an emblem with a literal mean- ing but a scene in which that emblem is under worship.92 Therefore, I propose that such a scene gready resembles many of the reliefs I have ana- lyzed. Curiously, Dehejia links her discussion of the triratna with mention of the Buddha's halo, say- ing that "Gandharan panels centering on the halo, or triratna, depict neither the worship of the Buddha in aniconic form nor worship at any specific site; rather they represent homage paid to the Buddhist faith itself through adoration of its attributive emblems" (63). Dehejia's equation of the halo to the triratna is puzzling since the triratna is an abstract symbol not associated with the Buddha's physical person and is not a relic. The halo, like the Buddha's robe, his begging bowl, the bodhi tree, and other objects he used, is considered a paribhogika relic and would have been worshiped as such. Justification for claim- ing that the halo is one of the "attributive em- blems" of Buddhism is not provided. Further, if the halo is an attribute, what does it signify? Dehejia identifies what she calls the "most impressive use of emblems as attributes" (63) in the decoration of the dome of the great stiipa at Amaravatf and illustrates an example (63-64) (fig. 18) .9 She explains that in the lowest register these carvings illustrate either a tree sheltering a seat or the Buddha himself; the central register usually portrays a wheel upon a pillar, although sometimes it has a representation of a preaching Buddha; and the uppermost register invariably shows a representation of a stupa.94 By looking at the three compositions occupying the three reg- isters of the Amaravatf dome slab, I cannot deter- mine how they differ from a number of scenes that Dehejia might identify as representing sa- cred sites or the aniconic presence of the Bud- dha. Each composition contains a central motif flanked by worshipers (lay worshipers, I might note). Yet Dehejia claims that "On this occasion, the tree or the image beneath the tree represents neither the event of the enlightenment nor the site of the event; the wheel or the preaching Buddha represents neither the first sermon nor its site; and the stiipa stands neither for the great</page><page sequence="22">132 SUSAN L HUINGTON I - s rJ a ~~~~~~~~~S '.~~~~~ I&gt; - lb- n - . v X &gt;g: t \ ts 6_v. , - FIG. 18 (Dehejia fig. 24).

Instead, she claims, the "intention seems to lie in quite another direction" (64), suggesting that the emblems (motifs) "repetitively reiterate the belief in the threejewels of Buddhism, thatis, the Buddha (lowest register), the Dhamma or doc- trine (central panel), and the Sanzgha . . . (upper register)" (64). In other words, Dehejia equates these three motifs with the meaning of the tnirat- na. As support for this proposal, she provides an endnote (66 n. 43) in which she suggests I. K. Sarma's agreement with such an interpretation. Apparentiy, Sarma told Dehejia that recently unearthed dome slabs from Amaravati have the syllables bo and dha inscribed on them. Dehejia does not explain where these inscriptions occur in relation to the compositions on slabs, orwheth- er they occur only or primarily on slabs that show the bodhi tree and the dharmacakra Since, as Dehejia herself notes, bo might stand for bodhi tree and dha might stand for dharmacakra, I am uncertain how these inscriptions therefore prove that the bodhi tree and the dharmacakra appear in these scenes as attributes standing for the Bud- dha and the Dharma. Dehejia's equation of the stiupa and the Samgha is given the following explanation: "I suggest it was because the relic mound was in- deed the center of the monastery and the very raison d'etre for the formation of the monastic community that congregated around a stiupa" (66 n. 43). In my view, this thinking requires a vast leap of faith, for the stupa might stand for other things as well. Further, such a claim about the centrality of the relic mound needs verification and explanation regarding whether this is always true or only at some sites and for some sects. If this is correct, I am delighted, since this information provides further support to my theory that places great emphasis on the relic cult and not simply the narration of the life of the Buddha. Dehejia continues that monks and lay worship- ers who would have circumambulated [the Am- aravati stuipa] would have had on their lips the "refuge" creed, taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Samgha, but she does not ex- plain how she knows what they would have been saying. Would these same words be spoken dur- ing the ritual practices at other stiupas, and, if so, thenwhy does the configuration occur here alone? Dehejia further claims that the reliefs would have been a visual affirmation [to the largely illiterate people] of their faith in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Samgha. Again, this speculation is stated</page><page sequence="23">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 133 without external proof. Most importantly, Dehe- jia does not define what it is about these particu- lar compositions that forces a different interpre- tation from the aniconic presence or site interpretations (64).9 Not only is the slab from Amaravati similar in type to scenes that she her- self might interpret as Buddha life events or site scenes, but she does not provide the Buddholog- ical sources of documentation for her explana- tions of the meanings of what she calls the em- blems. Her suggestion that in this case the tree or the "image" (I suggest absence of an image) beneath the tree represents the Buddha, the wheel represents the Dharma, and the stiipa de- notes the Samgha, is, therefore, unfath-omable. DEHEJIA'S Two PREREQuisrrEs Dehejia's belief in the use of emblems in early Buddhist art is the cornerstone from which she builds her argument for multivalency and is the crux of what she calls the "two critical and com- plementary prerequisites for the accurate inter- pretation of early Buddhist art" (45). The first of her two prerequisites is "an awareness of the multiple meanings conveyed by the major Bud- dhist emblems of the tree, the pillar, and the stiupa" (45), and the "second crucial prerequisite for interpreting the emblems is to acknowledge their multilayered significance" (45). The simi- larity in the way Dehejia defines her two prereq- uisites makes it difficult to establish and under- stand their distinctiveness. In otherwords, what is the difference between having "an awareness of the multiple meanings" of the emblems and "ac- knowledging their multilayered significance?" In addition, when the concept of the two prerequi- sites is introduced, it is explained that they are for the accurate interpretation of early Bucldhist art; when the second prerequisite is introduced, it is identified as a prerequisite for interpreting "the emblems" (45, para. 4). Therefore, it is unclear whether the prerequisites are for the interpreta- tion of early Buddhist art or for interpretation of emblems, or whether a distinction is imnplied at all. From the context of Dehejia's article and her discussion of works of art, I have assumed that the prerequisites are to be used to interpret the art, not the emblems.96 I infer that in the case of her first prerequisite a single motif can have multiple meanings, but, depending on circumstances, one or another of the meanings would be intended (45). The second prerequisite apparently means that references to multiple meanings were made simultaneously by an emblem within a single work of art (45). My understanding, then, is that the difference between her prerequisites is that in one case the motif carries the possibility of multiple meanings but in a specific context man- ifests primarily one of them, while in the other case the motif might carry multiple meanings simultaneously. In addition to this lack of clarity in definition, which makes it difficult to know how to apply the two prerequisites to the art, itis doubtful whether the two prerequisites are applicable to all exam- ples of early Buddhist art.97 If these two concepts cannot be applied to every work of art in this corpus, then they are not prerequisites. For ex- ample, the lower panel of what Dehejia calls the "Enlightenment Face" of the "Prasenajit Pillar" from Bharhut (fig. 4) does not even contain a nonfigurative motif that can be interpreted as an emblem; the scene above it contains a tree, but even Dehejia does not believe that the tree serves as an emblem in this context; and the two Agokan reliefs (figs. 11 and 12) contain nonfigurative elements, but it is difficult to sustain the notion that their principal role is emblematic. Without the presence of emblems, the prerequisites do not apply to these and similar works of art. Second, if my interpretation of the two prereq- uisites is correct, they are mutually exclusive: a single emblem cannot suggest only one meaning and more than one meaning simultaneously. In order for both prerequisites to be present in a single artistic composition, the work of art would probably have to contain a minimum of two emblems, one of which would stand for an ani- conic representation of a Buddha, or a sacred site, or an "attribute of the faith," while the other would embody two, or perhaps even all three, levels of meanings simultaneously.98 Since I sus- pect that the Indic artists would not be so con- trived as to create an artistic composition con- taining one emblem that had only one meaning and a second that had as many as three, I would argue that it is unexpected that a single work would manifest both prerequisites. Therefore, it is impossible for a single "emblem" to embody both the first and second prerequisites and un- likely that a given work of art would do so. Finally, I suggest that unless there is documen- tary evidence that the artists and patrons respon- sible for the creation of these artistic composi- tions were aware of and applied these principles to their art, they cannot be considered prerequi- sites, for prerequisites belong to the creators, not</page><page sequence="24">134 SUSAN L.

Ca. 100-80 B.CE. Indian Museum, Calcutta. Photo: American Institute of Indian Studies. the interpreters of the art. If they are instead general principles that reflect patterns found in the art and that can be used to help interpret the art, then this is another matter altogether. METHODOLOGY Unless there is agreement about the way in which knowledge about works of art is constructed, there is little chance that different scholars will agree in their conclusions. To understand the different approaches that scholars, such as Dehe- jia and I, might take to interpret the early Bud- dhist art of India, it is necessary to address some methodological issues, particularly the discrimi- nation between internal and external evidence. I shall use one of the sculptures Dehejia illustrates, a composition from Bharhut, and her related discussion as a case study (fig. 19). This rectangular composition shows a railing and gateway in the foreground that form the forward boundary of the precinct of a shrine in a courtyard. In the courtyard, an entourage of figures, some in a chariot, others on horseback and elephant, moves in a clockwise direction around the central structure. The shrine con- tains a representation of a Buddhist wheel and two male figures with hands in respectful pos- tures venerating the wheel. A pair of palm trees flanks the upper portion of the scene. There are two inscriptions contained within the composi- tion of this relief: the one on the roof of the gateway reads "r7kja Pasenaji Kosalo" (King Pasena- ji [Prasenajit] the Kosala [Kausala]);99 the sec- ond, which appears on the roof of the main building, reads "bhagavato dhamachaka?iz (The Wheel of the Doctrine of the Holy One).100 From the internal evidence contained within the relief, that is, the pictorial information as well as the two inscriptions, we can surmise the follow- ing:101 1. that one (or more; see below) of the figures in the composition represents King Prasenajit of Kosala;102 2. that the wheel within the upper shrine is a dharmacakra (Buddhist wheel of law) 'of' the holy one (bhagavato); 3. that an entourage of figures, including King Prasenajit, is circumambulating the dhar- macakra shrine in a clockwise fashion, as may be determined from the sequencing of the figures around the shrine, and that the entou- rage will exit the precinct of the shrine through the gateway at the lower right, as suggested by the figure on horseback coming forward through the gateway; 4. that two figures (possibly the same person depicted twice; see below) are inside the shrine venerating the wheel. But a number of questions are not specifically answered within the composition. Some can be answered through the use of sources external to the relief, while others may never be answered. Most importantly, simply from looking at the composition and translating the inscriptions, we do not know who King Prasenajitis in terms of his historicity-such aswhen he lived, where he lived, what his life stands for Buddhologically, and why he is shown in the art; we do not know the identification of the shrine or its location; we do not knowv the occasion that is immortalized in the composition (that is, why King Prasenajit is visit-</page><page sequence="25">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 135 ing this shrine); we do not know who built the shrine, when it was built, or why it was built; and we do not know the specific identity of any of the other figures in the scene, though we can deter- mine from their costume and physical features that all of them are male. Further, we do not know how this composition fits into its archaeological and artistic context at Bharhut, and ultimately into the whole corpus of early Buddhist art, that is, who made it, why it was made, and the purpose of the makers (including both artists and pa- trons) in portraying this scene as opposed to other possible subjects that were known to them. Although Dehejia does not cite the external sources she uses to interpret the scene-a prob- lem that persists in her discussion of virtually all of the works of art in her article'03-she makes a number of suppositions, interpretations, and claims (47), which include: 1. that King Prasenajit built a temple in honor of the Buddha (she seems to imply that the tem- ple was built at Sravasti but does not state this outright) ;104 2. that King Prasenajit visited this temple (pre- sumably with an entourage); 3. that the site being shown in the scene does not represent Sarnath, the location of the Bud- dha's first sermon; 4. that the label identifying King Prasenajit sug- gests what she infers to be "the actual historical event" in which the monarch visited the Bud- dha at Prasenajit's capital of Sravasti and lis- tened to his sermon; 5. that the wheel is portrayed "as an object of worship in the shrine erected by King Prasena- jit and to recall the sermon given there rather than to indicate the actual presence of the Buddha" (47); 6. that there is an "inevitable and surely intention- al" conflation of meanings conveyed by the relief: "The shrine was built by King Prasenajit at the spot where the Buddha had preached to him; undoubtedly, the artist intended that the relief should also recall that event" (47); 7. that "As a nonfigural emblem, the wlheel em- phasizes the Law and also refers to the Buddha as the Giver of that Law" (47);105 8. that most early Buddhist visual narratives con- tain this double (Dehejia actually provides a triple) layer of meaning; and 9. that once this concept of multiple meanings is accepted, "aniconism ceases to be such avexed problem" (47). Some of Dehejia's claims probably derive from secondary sources, that is, writers in recent or relatively recent times who have sought to inter- pret the art and who have in turn based their interpretations upon presuppositions, such as the belief in aniconism. In her analysis of this composition Dehejia adopts a position that draws upon that first presented by Alexander Cunning- ham more than a hundred years ago and which has been generally accepted since that time. Spe- cifically, Cunningham identifies the building housing the wheel as the "Punya SMla" (Hall of [Religious] Merit) that he claims was built by King Prasenajit at Sravasti for the use of the Buddha.06 One of the earliest believers in the concept of aniconism,'07 Cunningham suggests that in this composition the wheel is a symbol that takes the place of the Buddha himself (though why he would expect the Buddha to be sitting perpetually in the temple builtby Prasenajitis not evident). He claims that the wheel was intended "as a type of the advancement of the Buddhist faith by preaching, and thus becomes an emblem of Buddha the Teacher, in the same way that the Bodhimanda, or seat on which Sakya Muni sat for six years'08 in meditation, is used as a symbol of Buddha the Ascetic in all the Bharhut Sculptures, where the figure of Buddha himself is never represented."10 Some claims made by Dehejia, and others be- fore her such as Cunningham, are unverified from Buddhist literature, but others can be sup- ported. A brief search through textual sources reveals that:"10 1. King Prasenajit was a contemporary of the historical Buddha Sakyamuni, which allows us to infer that the "bhagavato" referred to in the inscription is Sakyamuni and not another Bud- dha; 2. King Prasenajit was a devotee of Sakyamuni and was converted by him when the king heard a sermon by Sakyamuni; 3. The conversion of King Prasenajit by the Bud- dha took place at the Jetavana in Anatha- pindada's park, near gravasti;"'l 4. King Prasenajit and the Buddha had an ongo- ing discourse and King Prasenajit made fre- quent visits to the Buddha to ask questions and receive the Buddha's wisdom." 2 These conversations took place at gravasti and possi- bly other venues as well."13 5. Sarnath, th-e place of Sakyamuni's first ser- mon, was situated within the Kosala kingdom</page><page sequence="26">136 SUSAN L. HUNTINGTON of King Prasenajit, and there is no reason to suppose that the king never visited Sarnath."14 Dehejia's claim that this relief does not repre- sent Sarnath, therefore, cannot be assumed a prioi. Archaeological sources reveal that there was a temple at Sarnath at least since Asokan times and that it had a wheel as the main object of worship; it is possible that another early patron had built such a temple there during the lifetime of the Buddha and that therefore Prasenajit could be shown visiting Sarnath."15 6. King Prasenajit may have built a shrine at Sravastx (perhaps to honor the Buddha), and it may have had a wheel as the main object of devotion. The seventh-century Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang describes some ruins at Sravasti, including a "Great Hall of the Law" (Saddhar- ma Mahasala) built by Prasenajit."16 However, the inscription in the relief that refers to the "Holy One's Wheel of Law" is not enough information to identify the site. (A detailed examination of clues in the relief, such as the two trees, might be helpful.) Even a more exhaustive search or the discovery of new materials is unlikely to provide the type of detail that Dehejia, Cunningham, andl others have accorded this relief. Even if it is assumed that the Buddhist wheel is intended to serve as a symbol of the Buddha's teachings, it cannot be determined that only one temple housing awheel as the main object of devotion existed during King Prasenajit's time-whether built by him or not. The existence of the temple that Xuanzang refers to at Sravasti does not negate the possibility that other similar temples had been built at other places where the Buddha taught.'17 The inscrip- tions only identify the king and the Buddhist wheel but do not specify the site or the event being commemorated. Further, the relief does not contain internal evidence to support the claim that the wheel is a symbol replacing the Buddha or that it serves as an emblem of the Buddha as a teacher. Cunning- ham's statement must have been based upon a belief in the concept of aniconism as a presuppo- sition for interpreting the art. Because Cunning- ham believed that the wheel served as a substitute for a figure of the Buddha, he tided the section of his text dealing with this relief "Visit of Prasenajita to Buddha" rather than "Visit of Prasenajit to a Temple with a Wheel" or something similar."8 While Dehejia modifies this aspect of Cunning- ham's analysis, she retains the notion that the wheel is an emblem serving both as a reminder of the sermon the Buddha gave to Prasenajit and as a reference to the Buddha as Giver of the Law (47). She says that a conflation of meanings is conveyed by the relief and that this conflation "is inevitable and surely intentional" (47) and, fur- ther, that: "The shrine was built by King Prasena- jit at the spot where the Buddha had preached to him; undoubtedly, the artist intended that the relief should also recall the event. As a nonfigural emblem, the wheel emphasizes the Law and also refers to the Buddha as the Giver of that Law" (47). While I concur that the wheel might be a reminder of the sermon (or one of the sermons, possibly the conversion sermon) the Buddha gave to Prasenajit and at the same time a refer- ence to the Buddha as Giver of the Law, a "re- minder of" and a "reference to" are not the same as a "representation of" a subject. I suggest that this relief is a representation of King Prasenajit performing veneration at a shrine that contains a Buddhist wheel and that these other meanings, while possibly implicit in the concept of the wheel, are not represented directly in the scene. The multivalent meanings that Dehejia identifies may be inherent layers of the wheel's meaning but are not what is being depicted in the relief. Thus, I contend that the relief portrays a single subject-Prasenajit's visit-and that, while the wheel is imbued with multiple layers of meaning, the additional layers do not constitute inter- changeable subjects for the relief. Such a scene expresses what I suggest is a popular and important theme on early Buddhist monuments-the devotion and piety of followers of the Buddha."9 Devotees might include hu- mans (both royalty and commoners), celestials, and animals. The Buddhological message of a relief like the Prasenajit composition, I propose, may not be the life of the Buddha in the biograph- ical sense but rather the good works and spiritual evolution of someone like King Prasenajit that occurred through the teachings of the Buddha.'20 The frequent appearance of compositions with similar messages among the reliefs at Bharhut, Sanaci, and other sites suggests that emphasis is being placed on the king. When shown on the early Buddhist monuments, such scenes are not intended to record events in the Buddha's life but rather to highlight the actions of his paradig- matic, faithful devotees. That a Tibetan monarch many centuries after the lifetime of King Prasena- jit wvould claim descent from him suggests that</page><page sequence="27">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 137 King Prasenajit was a model of kingly Buddhist worship.'2' If Prasenajit's importance was this great to the Tibetans many centuries after the creation of the Bharhut carvings, it can be in- ferred that his renown was also considerable at the time the Bharhut monument was created.'22 Buddhist piety is manifest in many of the scenes that Dehejia refers to as "site scenes." But it is also manifest in other scenes that traditionally have been viewed as aniconic representations of events of the Buddha's life. The Bharhut roundel show- ing Anathapir)dada covering the ground with pieces of gold to provide theJetavana monastery for the Buddhais also an example of this theme.'23 While the Buddha was the recipient of Anatha- piqdiada's generosity, what is being shown in the composition is not the Buddha receiving the gift but Anathapirndada paying the exorbitant price of the gift. The scene is, therefore, a demonstra- tion of the generous piety of one of the Buddha's followers, not a biographical subject in the Bud- dha's life. By not distinguishing between motifs as refer- ences, reminders, and representations, Dehejia concludes that the Prasenajit relief was intended to convey multivalent meanings. But, if her asser- tion that "Most early Buddhist visial narratives contain this double [sic for triple?] layer of mean- ing" (47) is based on the type of evidence she presents for this composition, then her claim may be insupportable. This methodological discussion distinguishes between internal evidence contained within an artistic work and the external evidence that can be used to amplify the interpretation of that work. The limitations of external sources are, unfortunately, extensive, not only because of their scarcity but because, frequently, they pro- vide conflicting information. This (liscuission also attempts to demonstrate that it is necessary to reexamine the art unfettered by the lore and presuppositions that have been passed down from generation to generation as truths. Because the theory of aniconism is so deeply embedded with- in a matrix of more than a hundred years of scholarly thinking, any challenge to that theory is scrutinized with careful detail and exceptions and apparent contradictions may seem glaring. However, I suggest that the burden of proof should rest with those who seek to add layers of interpretation and symbolism external to what is shown in the art. If a relief seems to show the literal depiction of devotion by an early king such as Prasenajit, or other subjects, then the burden of proving that it also is intended to communi- cate symbolic, emblematic, or other layers of meaning should belong to those who make the claim. Dehjia and the Issue of Aniconism THE THEORY OF ANICONISM The issue of aniconism plays two roles in Dehe- jia's article. First, the presupposition ofaniconism is incorporated into her discussion of emblems and multivalency, particularly in the "Aniconic Presence" section. Second, her defense of the traditional theory of aniconism is a subtheme woven into her discourse. I have already ad- dressed the first aspect andwill only discuss Dehe- jia's treatment of the general question of ani- conism here. As mentioned above, Dehejia had two purposes in writing her article, one stated and one unstat- ed. This duality is manifest throughout her arti- cle, as her textweaves between her stated purpose of demonstrating multivalency in the early art of Buddhism and her unstated purpose of defend- ing the theory of aniconism against the ideas I have presentecl. Her discussion of aniconism is selective, and the transitions between her trains of thought are often left unstated, rendering the sequence of ideas difficult to follow. For exam- ple, after her discussion of her figure 1 (fig. 19) there is a digression about the problem of ani- conism, which treats a number of separate topics and which is not clarified in relation to the theme and organization of her paper. I shall address the most significant of the issues raised in her article here. THE "PAGEANTRY THEORY" Dehejia discusses what she calls the "pageantry theory" in relation to a composition on one of the gateways at Sanici that I have published (fig. 2). She says that: "The pageantry theory proposed as an alternative to aniconism is riddled with com- plications; in particular, there is little evidence, if any, that Buddhism had a tradition akin to that of the Christian passion plays, in which events from a sacred biography were staged" (47). This state- ment must be clarified immediately. Neither I nor my husbandJohn has ever hinted, much less claimed, that the Buddhists had a pageantry tra- dition akin to Christian passion plays.124 My own suggestion relates to the idea of cele- brations of the main occasions of the Buddha's</page><page sequence="28">138 SUSAN L. HUNTINGTON life, some of which may have taken place at the actual sites of the events, rather than formal dramatic productions equivalent to passion plays.125 In my discussion of the Saiici relief (fig. 2), I have called the scene "a processional cele- bration."126Although later in the same discussion I use the term pageant-I say that some of the figures in the scene are not devas but rather actors in a pageant that recreates aspects of the event of Sakyamuni's departure-I used the term pageant in the dictionary sense, not as the equivalent of a passion play. Specifically, although the literal translation ofthe Middle English pagyn orpadgeant is "scene of a play," the current English defini- tions are: 1) a mere show or pretense; 2) an ostentatious display; 3) a show or exhibition, especially an elaborate, colorful exhibition or spectacle, often with music, that consists of a series of tableaux of a loosely unified drama; or 4) a procession, usually with floats.127 Any of these definitions could suit what I intend. Dehejia's extrapolation and exaggeration of my suggestion cannotbejustified. Further, when I used the term actorin reference to the figures carrying the horse in the relief, I intended to suggest that these individuals were participants playing a role in this circumstance and not that these individuals were necessarily professional actors. What I intended to convey was that there may have been reenact- ments as part of the celebration of events at sacred sites, possibly on anniversaries of Buddha life events. While Dehejia has not found in her "detailed search through Buddhist texts ... any evidence of pageants" (65 n. 13), she has no means of concluding that her search and my search were identical and that I have not found evidence to support my proposal. It is curious that, withoutwaiting to see whatmaterials I present in my book, Dehejia felt confident that her own search would produce the same results as mine. Further, without knowing that every relevant lit- erary work has survived, is available, and has been examined for this information, it is impossible to substantiate a claim that there is an absence of literary evidence. Dehejia maintains the long-held view that the scene is a representation of the Great Departure of the Buddha (actually Bodhisattva) prior to his enlightenment. The traditional interpretation assumes that the relief represents the actual event and that the absence of the human figure of the Buddha-to-be on the horse is evidence of ani- conism. As I have discussed above, Dehejia be- lieves that in this scene the Buddha-to-be is shown by emblems, but I have demonstrated that the Buddha-to-be's presence, if it is intended in the scene, would have to be indicated by his absence, not by an emblem. Dehejia observes that if the scene is a reenactment, the fact that there is no human actor on the horse is anomalous (48). But, if the scene represents another subject, the absence of the figure might not be problematic. Further, if it is necessary that there be no anom- alies for a scene to be correctly identified, then the anomalies in the composition that under- mine Dehejia's interpretation of the scene as an aniconic rendering of the Great Departure must also be considered. Let us examine this relief in detail. At the left is a palace, or perhaps a city, peopled by men and women who are awake, not asleep. According to the generally known accounts regarding the Bud- dha-to-be's departure, he left the palace quietly atnightwhen the inhabitants were asleep.'28 The secrecy of the departure is a prevailing emphasis in textual accounts of the event.129 Thus, if this composition represents the Great Departure, this aspect of the scene is incompatible with textual accounts. In front of the palace/city, a woman bows in apparent reverence before a pond with lotuses and ducks in it, again a theme that is not part of the usual Great Departure accounts. Ap- parently exiting from the city or palace gate is an entourage that includes a horse carried aloft by bearers (the horse's visible front right leg is clear- ly above the ground). The manner in which the horse is carnred is clarified the second and third times it appears; apparently, six bearers (three on the visible side of the horse and presumably three on the other side) bear the animal aloft. Textual accounts of the Great Departure usually mention four devas carrying the horse's hooves.'30 The representation of six human males rather than devas not only contrasts with literary evidence but differs from what is found in Bactro-Gandharan depictions of the Great Departure, where devas are clearly indicated.'3' Included in the entou- rage is a small male figure carrying a vessel; he appears just in front of the horse the first two times the horse is shown.'32 After the horse is shown the second time, the entourage arrives at a tree enshrined in a vedika; the liquid contained in the vessel is apparently being used to lustrate the tree.'" From the arrangement of figures around the tree, it may be surmised that the entourage has stopped to honor the tree and that the tree is not incidental to the subject matter. Indeed, since the tree occupies the central posi-</page><page sequence="29">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 139 tion in the composition-comparable to that of the bodhi tree and the Ramagrama stuipa in the Asokan compositions-it may be inferred that it is a crucial element. Yet this component of the scene-the veneration of a tree-is not part of the traditional versions of the Buddha-to-be's Great Departure known to me, nor is it men- tioned by Dehejia. The procession apparently then continues, with the horse being shown a third time borne by the same six figures (one of the figures on the unseen side of the horse, the most forward one, is partially visible). The entou- rage arrives at the site of a large pair of footprints. The horse, no longer being carried, and a small male figure (perhaps the vessel carrier?) are placed directly in front of the footprints, with the male human kneeling in veneration. Just below this scene the horse is shown again, walking rather than being carried by bearers and accom- panied by members of the entourage, all ofwhom are turned back as if returning in the direction from which they had come. In light of the impor- tance of the horse that I suggest below, it is notable that the human male figures at the right gesture respectfully to the horse. Dehejia does not discuss the presence or signif- icance of the two prominent nonfigurative motifs in the composition-the central tree and the footprints at the right, which she might claim serve as emblems. Yet I suggest that these are crucial clues to the correct interpretation of the activities in the scene, as I will discuss below. Another important element in the composi- tion that I have not mentioned is the umbrella, which appears five times. Dehejia asks why the artist would have "resorted to the extraordinary device of portraying a parasol hovering at an appropriate height above empty space over the horse [if the scene represents a reenactment]" (48). A careful examination of the position of the umbrella the first fouir tines it appears suggests that it is not being held above an invisible rider at all. The first time the umbrella appears it is held in front of the horse, the second time it is held to the side of the horse (and by a woman, not a deva), the third time it is tilted so that it could be read as being above the head of the horse or still to the side of the horse, and the fourth time the umbrella is lowered so that it seems to preclude enough space for a rider. The fifth and final time the umbrella appears it has been placed in the ground or into a stand next to the venerated footprints. When the horse is shown for the fifth time turning back towards the palace/city, the umbrella is not being carried along with it but has been left at the place of footprint veneration. If one accepts my suggestion that one of the main themes of India's early Buddhistartwas acts of piety (towards the Buddha especially) by dev- otees, such as kings like Prasenajit and AMoka as well as other devotees, then the subject I propose for this representation may be another demon- stration of this theme. My present thinking re- garding this composition is that it may be intend- ed to honor the Buddha-to-be's horse, Karlthaka, who not only carried him away from the palace at the time of the Great Departure butwho had been a lifelong companion and devoted servant of the young prince from the moment of their simulta- neous births. Buddhist literature talks of a "turn- ing around place," which the Buddha-to-be indi- cated was to become the Kanthakanivattana shrine (honoring the "turning around of Kailthaka").134 According to Thomas, the shrine of the Turning Back of Kar-thaka was probably a real shrine that was known to the authorities upon which the Pall commentator of the story had based his text.'35 The centerpiece of the composition is a tree shrine like those often used in India to mark sacred spots. The Sandc scene clearly seems to emphasize the horse, not the Buddha-to-be, and since an important element of the composition is that the horse turns around, the scene may reen- act Kanthaka's role in the departure in order to emphasize Kar)thaka's devotion and loyalty to the Buddha. The place of the footprints, which turn back toward the palace/city, may represent a commemorative spot, like that of the tree, per- haps in this case marking the place where the Buddha and the horse parted company.'36 That the humans accompanying the horse the final time the horse appears display gestures of respect to the animal fuirther suggests the important role of the horse in this composition. Because of her abiding belief that the biogra- phy of the Budldha was the primary subject of the early Buddhist art, Dehejia rejects the notion that an artistic rendering might show a re-creation of an event rather than the historical event itself. She claims that it "does a disservice to the notion of the religious devotion of the many hundreds of monks, nuns, and lay worshippers who contribut- ed towards the decoration of the Sanchi stupa... to suggest that they would build the immense stone structure and then decorate it merely with pictures of a pageant! Surely itwas unnecessary to depict the enactment of an event when the artist coulcl easily circumvent that middle step and</page><page sequence="30">140 SUSAN L. HUNTINGTON depict the event itself" (48). But, if the celebra- tions themselves had special meanings-as para- digms or reminders, for example-they might have had great importance and priority. Why might a Christmas card show a group of people sitting around a Christmas tree looking happy rather than depict the birth of Christ? Because something different is being communicated- something about the celebration and not the event. If one can infer from literature as well as the living traditions of South Asia, the ceremoni- al and celebratory life in ancient India was ex- traordinarily rich, and it is possible that these activities inspired some of the subject matter in art. When Dehejia says that it was unnecessary to depict the enactment of an event when the artist could circumvent that middle step and depict the eventitself, she makes a claim that can be substan- tiated only by proving (not merely asserting) that the life of the Buddha was more important than all other subjects and that other subjects were not even permissible because of that prioritization. STtPAs AND RELC WORSHIP Dehejia then embarks on a discussion of the theme of stipas and their role as repositories for relics (48), a topic I also discuss in my Art Jounal article.137 She begins by saying that the "whole'38 purpose of going to a stuipawas indeed to experi- ence the presence of the Buddha through prox- imity with his enshrined relic" (48). Incorrectly extrapolating from what I have said about the role of relics in Buddhism and Buddhist art, she further states that "the presence of the relic does not thereby preclude the need for stories from the life; in fact, reliving the historic life through viewing narrative sculptures recounting those events would enrich the experience of going to a stiupa" (48). While I agree that the presence of a relic does not preclude the inclusion of works of art portraying the life of the Buddha, neither are such life events required; while depictions of Buddha life scenes might "enrich the experience of going to a stuipa," so might the presence of other subjects as well. An "either/or" situation does not exist where a relic of the Buddha was enshrined. The richness of the role of relics and their im- plications for Buddhist practices are not addressed by Dehejia, who selects only one aspect of relics to discuss, namely, whether the presence of a relic obviates a need for Buddha images. In particular, she does not discuss the important distinctions among the principal types of relics recognized in Buddhism, namely, ianiraka, panbhogika, and udde4akal39 Her generalized reference to relics seems to be concerned specificallywith the safiraka type, that is, the remains of the Buddha's physical person. A pivotal aspect of my work is my empha- sis on the importance in Buddhist practice of paribhogika relics, which include all places the Buddha had ever been and all things he had used or touched. This second type of relic is central to my interpretation of many of the works of art at sites like Sanaci and Bharhut as scenes associated with pilgrimage practices. In other words, it is because paribhogika relics, such as the bodhitree or the site of Sarnath, have such crucial importance in Buddhist practice that I believe that they are shown in the art-they are not substitutes for preferred Buddha images but important in their own right. Further, Dehejia ignores the third type of relic, uddesaka, which are images or represen- tations of the Buddha, and the notion that, at least in some Buddhist traditions, uddesaka are considered to be less important than the other two typeS.'40 It should also be noted that the veneration of relics in Buddhism is not limited to those of kakyamuni Bucldha. Relics of other past Bud- dhas, of Bodhisattvas (such as the Dalai Lama, who is revered as an incarnation of Avalokites- vara), of venerated members of the clergy, and others are also treasured and honored. Looking at the phenomenon of Buddhism in its myriad forms and in the many regions where it flour- ished, it is apparent that the veneration of relics is one of the most important aspects of the religion. It is manifest not only in the early Buddhist culture of India but in later traditions (such as that of the Pala dynasty of eastern India, with its emphasis on the paribhogika sites of the eight major life events of the Buddha), in the Bactro-Gandhara region, in Myanmar (Burma), in Thailand, in Sri Lanka, in China, in Mongo- lia, in Nepal, and in Tibet.14' Relics and their veneration provide a vitally important focus in the religion, and much of the art and architec- ture must be understood in light of this truth.'42 ANICONISM AND THE DEPICTION OFJATAKAS Using the same line of reasoning-that the pres- ence of a relic does not obviate the need for representations of the Buddha's life events- Dehejia turns to the subject of jataka in early Buddhist art. She says: "Equally, it is not valid to assume that the prevailing religion during this early period emphasized the perfection ofvirtues</page><page sequence="31">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 141 narrated in the ja2takas, thereby obviating the need for life scenes" (48). 143 However, it is incorrect to presume that I would claim that jaztakas were a substitute for Buddha life scenes, thereby setting up an "either/or" situation. In fact, my view is quite the opposite. Instead, it is previous scholars attempting to un- derstand early Buddhist art in light of the prevail- ing aniconic theory who have viewed jatakas as surrogates selected because the presumed prima- ry subject matter-scenes from the life of the Buddha showing him in human form-was as- sumed to be forbidden. I contend that the jatakas convey a series of important Buddhological mes- sages in their own right, particularly since the literary conventions used for jatakas emphasize their didactic importance rather than their role solely as sources of biographical information for the Buddha. While on a literal level they might be seen as biographical, on a didactic level they are paradigms of the Buddhist pilgrim's progress toward an enlightened state. Each jitaka consists of three sections: the first is the explanation of the catalyst that causes the Buddha to tell that particular story as a related lesson; the second is the story itself; and the third and final section is the meaning or lesson of the story. Western schol- ars have traditionally emphasized the middle of the three, that is, the narrative, and, when inter- preting jataka on art monuments, have consid- ered their tasks fulfilled when they have identi- fied the main actors in the scene and recounted the events of the story. But I believe that, Buddho- logically, it is the underlying lesson that is most important. Thus, the j&amp;takas, along with scenes of Buddhist piety, the devotional scenes at Buddhist sacred sites, and other subjects, served to deliver the communicative messages of the monuments. They are not substitutes for biographical scenes of the Buddha's life, and, therefore, Dehejia has inverted the point. Further, her reluctance to accept an emphasis on the perfection ofvirtues in the "prevailing religion" almost argues against the importance of one of the central goals of the Buddhist religion itself-the spiritual perfection of the individual (48). As paradigms of the Bodhi- sattva's perfections mastered during his many lifetimes, the jatakas are among Buddhism's most poignant reminders of the ultimate pursuit of the religion. The apparent theme of Dehejia's paragraph, which began with a discussion of stfipas as repos- itories for relics and then turned to the issue of the role ofjastakas, becomes clear at the end when she states: "The proposition that the early art of India'44 was not primarily concerned with the biography of the Buddha is difficult to sustain" (48).'45 Yet Dehejia does not demonstrate this either in her discussion of relics and jatakas or in the course of her article. My research suggests that there are many cases that, while usually seen as representing life scenes of the Buddha, are depictions of something else altogether. The scene from Bharhut showing King Prasenajit at a tem- ple with an enshrined wheel (fig. 19), I have argued, represents a story about King Prasenajit, not an event in the life of the Buddha. Likewise, the two Asokan compositions are not biographi- cal scenes of the Buddha, the jatakas are not scenes of the Buddha's last life, and I suggest that there are many other compositions among the corpus of early Buddhist art that are not depic- tions of life events of the Buddha. That Dehejia confuses this issue is clearly demonstrated when she precedes her discussion of the two reliefs about King Asoka with the statement that: "It is difficult to sustain the argument that early Bud- dhist artists and patrons were not primarily con- cerned with the biography of the Buddha" (56- 57).146 She then follows that sentence with examples of two sculptures that portray the life of Asoka, not the Buddha. By discussing the two Asokan examples, she is inadvertently support- ing my viewpoint-that the early Buddhist art of India is not solely concerned with the biography of the Buddha. If Dehejia is implying thatAsoka's visits to the sites of Bodh Gaya and Ramagrama are part of Buddha's biography, not the story of Asoka, then I cannot agree. Certainly, Asoka visited these places because of the Buddha and his devotion to the Buddha, but that is not the same as saying that his visits at sacred sites or scenes showing these visits are demonstrations of the life of the Buddha. She continues this theme by stating that "On the contrary, scenes from the Buddha biography took pride of place in the decorative scheme of the first extensively deco- r ated stiipa at Bharhut" (48) 147 and then enumer- ates where and how many such scenes she identi- fies on the Bharhut monument. However, if her evidence that these are life scenes is no stronger than that which she presents in her article, then I propose that her numbers are likely to be inaccurate. TIME AND PLACE Without clarifying where the idea of "time and place" was introduced and how it applies to the</page><page sequence="32">142 SUSAN L. HUNTINGTON early Buddhist art of India, Dehejia addresses (52) the following proposal I have made about some reliefs:'48 "Two observations may be made about reliefs that actually portray Buddha's life events: (1) the place being shown is the place where the event occurred, and (2) the timeof the activity depicted in the composition is the time of the event itself. These two conditions generally are not present or even implicit in reliefs of the 'aniconic' type."'49 In response to this idea, Dehe- jia states that "tirtha proponents'50 maintain that these elements [time and place] are always ex- plicitly indicated in iconic life scenes but general- lyabsentin anicon ic renderings, which are hence, presumably, to be understood as sacred sites" (52).151 She tries to prove the incorrectness of my position by showing an "aniconic" scene in which she sees references to time and place. With re- gard to a relief at Sanici she states: "If place and time are key clues indicating a life scene, both elements occur in the aniconic portrayal at SaXn- chi" (53). My intention was not to claim that time and place are not indicated in the "aniconic" scenes but rather that the time of the actvity of the scene is not the time of the Buddha life event and that the sacred site being shown may not be one where a Buddha life event occurred. Thus, I have sug- gested that, while a scene like King Prasenajit's visit to a shrine (fig. 19) may take place at the very site where a Buddha life event occurred, the time at which King Prasenajit's visit occurs is not the time of the Buddha life event but simply the time at which the king made the visit. Further, since there are many sacred sites throughout the Bud- dhist world that are revered even though the Buddha may never have visited them, some com- positions may be depictions of such places. Dehe- jia's own suggestion that the two scenes from Amaravati that she illustrates (her figs. 20 and 21) show local sacred sites, not places associated with Buddha life events, seems to argue for my case. What I intended to communicate in my statement was that, unless a scene is clearly a Buddha life event, one cannot presume that the place or the time being depicted have any refer- ence at all to the Buddha or one of his life events. SUMMATION REGARDING DEHEJIA'S ARTICLE AND THE THEORY OF ANICONSM In the foregoing, I have attempted to clarify some of the points that Dehejia raises in response to ideas I have presented abouit the problem of aniconism as a general theory for the interpreta- tion of early Buddhist art. It is clear that many of the objections and counterarguments she pre- sents arise from her misunderstanding of my work and incorrect extrapolations based on state- ments I have made. The problem is further exac- erbated by the fact that she bases her argument'in part on what she anticipates I will say in my forthcoming book. Because the topics that she draws from my work are not clearly associated with her main theme of multivalency, it is not always evident how they relate to her general effort to reinterpret the art. For example, her discussion of jatakas is directly aimed at state- ments I have made but does not address the problem of relating this type of scene to her multivalency theory. The reader is left to wonder how the jatakas, an important narrative subject on the early monuments, can be reconciled with her theory since they do not seem to be multiva- lent and do not use emblems. The fact that Dehejia does not use a systematic and compre- hensive approach to critiquing my ideas, but rather selects only a few themes, creates problems in clarity for the reader, misrepresents my work, and undermines the presentation of her own multivalency theory. Dehejia's Conclusion In her conclusion, Dehejia claims that while Alfred Foucher "misstated the nature and ex- tent of aniconism, he was certainly accurate in perceiving its existence" (64). In the first part of this quote, she nmakes precisely my point: I be- lieve that Foucher (and others who have es- poused the aniconic theory) have misstated the nature and extent of aniconism. Whether he was accurate in perceiving its existence is still to be determined. But as I have said already in publi- cation, even if a few aniconic images do exist, the probability that the majority of representa- tions from this corpus are not aniconic means that the theory of aniconism cannot be used as a universal explanation of the art of the period. Dehejia continues the first paragraph of her conclusion by making statements thatagreewith points I have made and that undermine the evidence for the aniconic theory: 1) what is now known to be the lack of correlation between the old HIinayana/Mahayana model and aniconism and 2) the existence of numerous "site scenes" among the repertoire of early Buddhist art. With slight changes, I could have written this para- graph myself. Dehejia's final paragraph addresses her theme</page><page sequence="33">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 143 of multivalency. She states: "One must accept the multilayered significance of many early bas re- liefs and recognize that more than one meaning may have been intended by the artist, as well as read by the ancient beholder" (64). She notes thattwentieth-centuryviewersmightfind it strange that a composition showing the Buddha's en- lightenment might include a shrine erected after the event, and that they might find it anachronis- tic that a panel showing Asoka's visit to Bodh Gaya would include a shrine built only after his visit. "Yet," she concludes as her final sentence, "artists and devotees of the first century B.C. prob- ably viewed such a scene as a perfectly reasonable way to present a reminder of both the sacred site at Bodh Gaya and an event in the life of the Buddha or of King Asoka" (64) .152 The interpre- tations I have offered regarding these two scenes (figs. 4 and 11) suggest that the choice of these two examples is unfortunate as an argument for Dehejia's position. Position Statement and Conclusions Readers of this pair of articles by Dehejia and me are probably well aware of the history of the aniconic theory, its pivotal role in the interpreta- tion of the early Buddhist art of India, and my challenge of the theory's validity as an overarch- ing explanation for the subject matter of early Buddhist art. The position that Dehejia takes is that aniconism is still a viable theory for the interpretation of early Buddhist art, although she agrees, following my work, that it has been too widely applied. Nonetheless, our positions di- verge in that, as I infer from her article, she claims that aniconism should still be considered a dom- inant aspect, while I propose that aniconism is not a satisfactory general theory by which to interpret the art and may not even be applicable to more than a small fraction of the early Bud- dhist art. With the recent invalidation of the externaljustification for the practice ofaniconism in art, I believe that it is imperative that the theory be reexamined. The now-recognized fallacious- ness of the long-held Hi-nayana/Mahayana mod- el and the acknowledgment that Hinayanists used images of Buddhas force scholars along new paths of inquiry.'53 If it can be determined that "ani- conism"'54 does not exist in the art, then new explanations must be found to interpret the art. Or, if the art is found to contain representations that must truly be characterized as "aniconic," then new explanations-for example, Buddho- logical, social, cultural, or artistic-must be dis- covered to provide a rationale for this practice. Further, because "aniconism" might be only one of many other themes in the early Buddhist art of India, its role in the communicative message of the art must be correlated with the many other subjects depicted in the surviving art. One of the areas of strongest disagreement between Dehejia and me relates to the underly- ing meanings and the communicative message of early Buddhist art. While she retains the tradi- tional belief that early Buddhist art was primarily concerned with the historical Buddha'Sakyamuni and the events of his life, I believe that a different message, or perhaps several different messages, comprise the more likely content of the art.'55 Looking at the artistic compositions not only as individual entities but also as components of an overall message or series of messages, I suggest that the artists and patrons responsible for the art were reinforcing a number of important didactic, spiritual, religious, and social themes within Bud- dhist culture. These themes might include the idea of generosity (exemplified by Anatha- pindada's gift of the Jetavana grove); religious piety by lay persons (as seen in the many illustra- tions of lay devotions at sacred sites); the belief that all sentient beings, not only humans, are moving along the religious path (exemplified by the worship of the Ramagrama relics by the nagas, the Bharhut reliefs showing the devas and apsara- sas, and the many scenes showing devotional activities by elephants, monkeys, and other ani- mals); conversion and reform (exemplified by the inclusion of the story of Ajatasatru); paradig- matic Buddhist kingship (exemplified by illustra- tions of life events of individuals like Moka and Prasenajit); and the perfection of moral and spiritual qualities (exemplified by the popular inclusion of j7aaka stories on the early monu- ments). While I would never suggest that Sakyamuni Buddha did not play a vitally impor- tant function in early Buddhism as a role model and in other capacities, I suggest that the reli- gious message of the art also included a range of instructional and soteriological/methodologi- cal models addressed to the ordinary being. (And here, when I refer to the "ordinary being," I do not want to be misconstrued as referring specifically to a lay person. Rather, I mean "ordi- nary" in the sense of the vast majority of living creatures, including animals as well as people, who, according to the tenets of Buddhism, are still struggling to develop their spiritual qualities.) Dehejia's abiding belief in the symbolic and</page><page sequence="34">144 SUSAN L. HUNTINGTON emblematic role played by nonfigurative motifs and subjects in the art has not been supported through either internal evidence within the artis- tic compositions or by external documentation. I suggest that the expectation-not the actuality- that these elements play a symbolic role is an important reason why the idea persists in the interpretation of early Buddhist art. This is not to say that there are no symbols and emblems in early Buddhist art, for clearly there are many. The very pillars, cakras, and some of the other motifs discussed by Dehejia can serve as emblems, but this is not, I suggest, their principal role when they are depicted in many of the narrative scenes on monuments such as the stipas at Sana and Bharhut.156 By selecting out certain themes I raised in my publications, Dehejia does not convey the cohe- siveness of the work that I have published thus far-mainly visible in the ArtJournal article. Al- though she addresses a number of points that I make in my Art Journal article and the Art of Ancient India, as enumerated in the section on "Dehejia and the Theory of Aniconism" above, she removes ideas from their contexts and fails to undertake a systematic critique of my work. The most reasonable solution (s) to the aniconic proW lem must take into account the strengths and weaknesses of both the traditional theory and any new ideas that are presented. Yet her arguments ignore the substantial evidence I have presented about a number of important issues. I invite the interested reader to consult my "Early Buiddllhist Art" article, and particularly my discussions of the following issues: safiraka, patibhogika, and uddesa- ka relics and the related questions about the prioritization of relics versus images; Sri Lankan Buddhist practices relating to the sixteen sacred sites, which, I believe, are reflective of and strong- ly related to some of the practices and religious concerns revealed in early Buddhist art; the role of pilgrimage in early Buddhist religious prac- tice; the problems of varied interpretations of the Bharhut inscriptions; the evidence of inscribed reliefs, such as those from Bharhut, showing and labeling the bodhi trees of some of the former Buddhas; the certainty from archaeological evi- dence that Buddha images were being produced (and have survived from) the very period of production of the so-called aniconic works of art; and, finally, the crucial issue of historiography and how it relates to the theory of aniconism. While Dehejia and I agree that there are some works that are, or, in my opinion, might be, aniconic, and that there are some works that clearly are not, we differ vigorously in our respec- tive analyses of specific works of art. Some of this difference in interpretation may arise from what may be our respective propensities for wishing to claim one or another individual specimen for the aniconic or non-aniconic camp. But some of this difference must also be seen as reflecting a tran- sitional point in our knowledge about early Bud- dhism and its art, when many of the old presup- positions have been stripped away but new generalizations are notyetin place. I suggest that Dehejia's multivalency theory represents an ad- mirable attempt to reconcile the seeming invinci- bility of the institutionalized aniconic theorywith the flaws and weaknesses that theory embodies, some of which I have recently addressed. I sug- gest that Dehejia's view represents a midway point in a transition that evinces a reluctance to aban- don the old while recognizing the validity of the new. Dehejia has essentially proposed a compro- mise position in which elements of the old theory that still seem to make sense are reconciled with new information that changes the direction of earlier thinking on the subject. I believe that scholars of Indic art should con- tinue to move forward on the issue of aniconism and seek a new generalization or series of gener- alizations that accommodate the importance of a variety of themes evident in the art, including but not limited to what I have identified as scenes of pilgrimage and lay devotion (which Dehejia has dubbed the "site" scenes). The new generaliza- tions should be consistent with the patterns of belief and practice of the Buddhism of the corre- sponding period, as documented by texts, in- scriptions, and other sources. Further, the new generalization (s) must move beyond consider- ation of individual compositions and consider their potential role in a larger context of a series of images or even an entire monument. As I have tried to demonstrate in this article, I do not believe that the multivalency theory offered by Dehejia fulfills these criteria. Whether my own work will help move scholarship further along the path to these goals, of course, remains to be seen.157 A Closing Thtought Although it is unlikely that any individual can be completely unfettered by the values and concerns of his or her own culture, scholars today</page><page sequence="35">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 145 have become aware of the ways in which our personal vantage points bias our interpretations of other contemporary cultures and those of the past. Concomitantly, scholars in the humanistic and social science disciplines recognize the need to understand other cultures in their own right, rather than according to the standards and crite- ria of the observer. While recognizing the desir- ability of this ideal does not necessarily liberate us from lapses in objectivity, this awareness at least helps us to confront some of the biases that color our interpretations. In the historiographic portions of my forth- coming book, I plan to suggest-as I did in the paper I presented at the 1991 conference of the American Committee for South Asian Art-that the origination, perpetuation, and passionate advocacy of the aniconic theory is deeply embed- ded within a matrix of Western cultural view- points that were transferred to, or perhaps im- posed upon, the Indic situation. I will suggest, for example, that nineteenth- and early twentieth- century writers may have been predisposed by their knowledge of the Judaeo-Christian-Islamic heritage, with its recurring disputations over whether to represent God in the art, to puzzle over the apparent avoidance of Buddha images in early Buddhist art. At the same time that the religious heritage of Western scholars may have colored their interpretations of ancient Indic culture, the political relationships between the Asian and European worlds must have played a significant role in the formulation of their ideas, causing Western imperialist viewpoints also to affect the ways in which European scholars per- ceived early Buddhist art. Alfred Foucher, for example, explains the apparent absence of early Buddha images by claiming that the Indians were not clever enough to think of the idea of an image themselves; he credits the Western (Greco-Ro- man) culture of the Indic northwest for what he considered to be this superior innovation.'58 Such views have influenced the study of early Buddhist art for more than a century. Two terms from the discipline of linguistics that have now become current among disciplines involved in crosscultural studies seem pertinent here, and, I believe, should be at the forefront of every scholar's mind as he or she embarks upon a study of the past.159 The first term, etic, is defined as "of, relating to, or involving description of linguistic or behavioral phenomena considered in isolation from a particular system or in relation to predetermined general concepts."'10 The sec- ond and opposing term, emic, is defined as "of, relating to, or involving analysis of linguistic or behavioral phenomena in terms of the intermal structural or functional elements of a particular system."'6' I suggest that the study of early Bud- dhist art has been dominated by an etic approach for more than a century, in which a predeter- mined, general concept-namely, the theory of aniconism-has influenced the way in which the arthas been interpreted. Itis time, I propose, that we examine the art for what is there and look beyond the expectations that may have their origin largely in the imaginations of those who encounter and interpret, but did not create, the art.</page><page sequence="36">146 SUSAN L. HUNTINGTON Notes I am grateful to Frederick M. Asher, Nancy E. Eder, John C. Huntington, Miranda Shaw, and especially Janice M. Glowski for reading drafts of this manuscript and for their advice and help throughout the writing process. 1. Vidya Dehejia, "Aniconism and the Multivalence of Emblems," Ars Orientalis 21 (1991): 45-66 (sub- sequent page references given parenthetically in the text). 2. Dehejia defends her discussion of my work at this stage on the basis that the ideas have been present- ed in a volume that has "entered the textbook repertoire" (65 n. 4). She refers to myArtofAncient India. See Susan L. Huntington, with contribu- tions by John C. Huntington, The Art of Ancient India (New York and Tokyo: John Weatherhill, Inc., 1985). I do not understand this rationale, particularlysince the ideas are offered in thatbook as tentative new interpretations. Further, in my article "Early Buddhist Art and the Theory of Aniconism," Art Journal 49, no. 4 (Winter 1990): 401-8,I explain that Iwill present the full range of my research in a forthcoming book on the early Buddhist art of India. 3. See S. Huntington, "Early BuddhistArt," 408 n. 43, in which I state: "At this time, I am unable to predict whether there are indeed some images that require a Buddha figure and must be seen as truly 'aniconic' in the sense that they employ a symbol as a substitute for what should be an an- thropomorphic representation. However, even if a few images are truly aniconic, the vast majority are not, and the role of'aniconism' has been vastly overemphasized, ultimately leading to the misin- terpretation of most of the extant art." The defini- tion of aniconic that I used in the Art Journal article, that the Buddha might be referred to by symbols, is expanded in the present article to include depictions that may refer to him through his absence. See below. 4. S. Huntington, Art of Ancient India, 70-71, 72-73, 87,98-99, 100. 5. I am certain that Dehejia was in the audience for the 1988 paper, since she chaired the session in which itwas presented and led the ensuing discus- sion. I do not know whether she was in the audi- ence for the 1991 presentation. 6. Although my husband, John C. Huntington, has notbeen working on the "aniconic problem" perse, he has incorporated some of my ideas into hiswork and has published a number of articles that are pertinent to the topic, some of which are referred to by Dehejia. I include mention ofJohn C. Hun- tington's work here since Dehejia seems to con- flate us and our work, as when she refers to my work and then says, "For further understanding of theirargument" (65 n. 4; italics mine). For the most relevant publications byJohn C. Huntington see his 'The Origin of the Buddha Image: Early Image Traditions and the Concept of Buddhadar?ana- punya," in Studies in Buddhist Art of South Asia, ed. A. K Narain (New Delhi: Kanak, 1985): 23-58. He later published a Chinese dated Buddha image that he discussed in that article:John C. Hunting- ton, "A Note on a Buddha Image from China dated to the year 36 of the Pre-Christian Era (former Han Chien Chao third year)," Lalit Kald 22 (1985): 27-31 but retracted it since the piece was found to be a forgery. See his letter to the editor in Lalit Kala 23 (1988): 44-45. Although this piece has been shown to be a forgery, the discovery regarding its authenticity does not alter the basic premise of his work or negate the other strong evidence that he presents.

Dehejia does not seek religious, philosophical, social, and political explanations for what she perceives to be multivalency in the art but relies purely on a literary analogy. I suggest that these avenues of investigation might be equally, if not more, important in attempting to understand multivalency in the art. 11. There are strict rules for determining where and how to break the words in Sanskrit, but, in spite of the rigidity of the rules, significant play and ambi- guity is possible. 12. The term pun often suggests a humorous double meaning in the English context. I use it here</page><page sequence="37">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 147 without any implication that humor is intended. Chinese and Sanskrit are particularlywell suited to punning. While in contemporary American En- glish punning is often derided as a low form of humor, in other languages, such as Chinese and Sanskrit, itis a highly respected literary technique. 13. In many languages, multiple meanings can also be implied by using homonyms, such as dearand deer. 14. Here Dehejia says: "Equally, a relief may be read both as an event in the life of the Buddha and as the holy site at which that event occurred." 15. Dehejia credits the artistwith the choice of subject matter (57 and passim). However, in ancient India the situation was not so clearcut; it is likely that patrons as well as members of the clergy played significant roles in the selection of artistic subject matter. 16. For example, see S. Huntington, Art of Ancient India, 642 n. 18. 17. See Susan L. Huntington andJohn C. Huntington, Leaves from the Bodhi Tree (Dayton and Seattle: Dayton Art Institute and the University of Wash- ington Press, 1990), 104-5. Because the metaphor occurs on imperial copperplates issued by the Pala kings themselves, the comparison is especially com- pelling, leaving little doubt that the kings them- selves were aware of the analogy. While the meta- phor is given expression through its literary form in the copperplates and visually in the image type, it represents far more than a mere literary or artistic phenomenon. Rather, revealing as it does the views the Pala kings held about their political power and probably their attempt to legitimize their rule through the authority of the prevailing Buddhist culture, the analogy is deeply embedded within the PaMa cultural sphere and can only be fully understood as such. 18. Although I use the term emblem in some of my writings, I do not use the term in the same situa- tions as Dehejia. While I do believe that there are emblems (and symbols) in Buddhist art (see my "Position Statement and Conclusion" section), I do not agree that the motifs in the compositions she discusses are used emblematically. 19. Although Dehejia does not use the term nonfigural or nonfigurative in her definition of an emblem, she uses the term nonfigural several times in her text, making it clear that she refers specifically to nonfigurative motifs. See, for example, her em- phasis on the nonfigural aspect of the Buddhist wheel (47). The assumed correlation between being nonfigurative and being emblematic is a cornerstone of traditional aniconic thinking. 20. She uses the mango tree as one example (45). 21. For my discussion of Dehejia's phrase "attribute of the faith," see section entitled 'The Emblems of the Tree, the Pillar, and the Stiupa as an Attribute [of the Faith]." See also n. 27. 22.

On p. 59, the text specifically names the tree as a Niiia tree and states that the Buddha sat beneath the tree. 25. It is impossible for me to foreshadow many of the conclusions I will reach in my completed book. 26. Dehejia herself mentions the empty space above the horse (48, lines 10-11). Rather than recogniz- ing the contradiction the empty space creates for her theory of emblematic representations, she presents the idea of the empty space to argue against my pageantry interpretation. 27. I have added "of the faith" since when Dehejia first discusses this concept (45), she includes the phrase. The termfaith seems antiquated as a description of the complex social, cultural, soteriological, and other aspects of the Buddhist religious complex. 28.

Dehejia vastly oversimplifies the problems relating to the terms bodhoand bodhi(65-66 n. 20). The issue is discussed in my forthcoming book. Also see Heinrich Luiders, ed., Bharhut Insniptions, rev. and supplemented by Ernst Waldschmidt and MadhukarAnantMehendale, CorpusInscriptionum Indicarum,vol. 2, pt. 2 (Ootacamund: Government Epigraphist for India, 1963), 94-96. 32. See also Lfiders, Bharhut Inscriptions, 97-100. 33. Actually, Dehejia's statement is contradictory. She says that the gods came to praise the enlightened Buddha, implying that he was already enlight- ened, and that the event occurred simultaneously with the enlightenment. Dehejia cites Rajendrala- la Mitra, TheLalitavistara (Calcutta: Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1877), 457 (end of ch. 22 and beginning of ch. 23) as the source of her information. 34.

(London: Luzac and Co., 1949-56), 2:318. 36. The discrepancies between textual accounts re- main to be worked out in relation to this scene. 37. The Lalitavistaraenumerates sixteen ways in which the gods of Suddhavasa "spoke words to weaken Mira," and sixteen ways in which other gods at- tempted the same. See Bays, The Voice oftheBuddha, 2:499-502. 38. She does not clarify whether the figures arrive before or after the enlightenment. 39. Dehejia states: 'Since early Buddhist inscriptions [does she mean all early Buddhist inscriptions or only those at Bharhut?] are so easily readable, I have used my own translations to avoid burdening the text unduly with footnotes [sic for endnotes]. In the single instance where variant readings are possible, a note has been added" (65 n. 9). Al- though Dehejia claims that she has translated all of the inscriptions herself, her wording in the case cited here is curiously like that of Luiders, Bharhut Inscriptions, 100, no. B27. In particular, since Liuders infers the word mimic from the sculpture and an understanding ofparticular dance forms although the term is not directly used in the inscription, it is strange that Dehejia includes the term mimic in what she implies is her own literal translation. See Luders, Bharhut Insciptions, 101, for his reasoning regarding the dance. Dehejia's statement that a variant reading is possible only in one instance [of the Bharhut inscriptions?] oversimplifies the case. First, there are discrepancies among authors re- garding the accurate transliteration from the an- cient script; second, while the gist of the inscrip- tions might be easily discerned, there are points of grammar that can be disputed and that have rele- vance to the meanings of the inscriptions. 40. S. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art," 404. 41. Although Dehejia does not specify whom she re- fers to with the words 'Those who deny the exist- ence of aniconism," I assume she is referring to my work. However, as I have explained above, I have not denied the existence of aniconism but only proposed that aniconism is not an all-inclusive explanation for the art. Throughout Dehejia's article, it is clear that she has confused these two issues. 42. She does notspecifyhow she is able to predictwhat another individual might say. 43. But it might not; see n. 46. 44. S. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art," 404. 45. In spite of this similarity, "aniconic" phases for Hinduism andJainism have never been proposed. 46. Conversely, the presence of Indra and Brahma is not proof that the scene represents the Buddha life event, if the writings of the seventh-century Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang can be trusted. Xuan- zang records that the early Buddhist kings had constructed ladders at the site of the descent. Atop the ladders, they built a vihaTra to house a stone image of a Buddha, and flanking the ladders (appar- ently near the bottom) were figures of Indra and Brahma. The relevant passage of text is cited in S. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art," 404. See also Samuel Beal, trans., Si-yu-hi. Buddhist Records ofthe Western World. Translated from the Chinese of Hiuen Tsiang (A.D. 629), 2 vols. (London: Trubner and Co., 1884; rpt., Delhi: Oriental Books Reprint Corporation, 1969), 1:203. Therefore, it is pos- sible that some representations that include depictions of Indra and Brahma might show the sacred site, not the Buddha life event. In the case of fig. 5, because the scene contains a figure that is likely to represent the nun Utpala (Utpalavarna), who, according to some sources including Xuan- zang, greeted the Buddha on his descent, the composition may show the life event. However, something puzzles me about this particular com- position, which I have never seen or examined in person. From the photograph kindly supplied by Martha Carter, it appears as if an upper register might have been broken off, in which case a repre- sentation of a Buddha at the top of the ladder may</page><page sequence="39">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 149 have been originally included. Such a composition would correlate with Xuanzang's description of the monument that had been erected at the site, which included a vih&amp;ra with a Buddha image at the top. Thus, it is possible that this would not be an "aniconic" representation of a Buddha life scene but a damaged piece that had originally included a Buddha figure. In other words, I see at least three possible interpretations of this sculp- ture: it could depict a Buddha life event without a representation of the Buddha, which would make it an "aniconic" scene; it could be an "iconic" representation of a Buddha life scene with the Buddha figure now missing; or it could be a repre- sentation of the sacred site with the figures of Indra and Brahma intended to be images that had been installed at the site (possibly, with a now-lost Buddha image at the top). In the latter case, the kneeling figure would need explanation. The ar- gument that images of the Buddha, Indra, and Brahma had been installed at the sacred site may not affect the interpretation I have offered regard- ing the Bharhut composition. The textual account that refers to the image mentions all three; if representations of Indra and Brahma were shown, but not the Buddha, then this might be evidence for "aniconism." If none of the figures are depict- ed, as in the Bharhut example, this might only indicate the existence of alternative textual tradi- tions or that the statues and ladders reported by Xuanzang in the seventh century might not have existed as early as the date of the Bharhut carving. 47. She refers toJohn C. Huntington, "Pilgrimage as Image," pt. 1, 56. 48. It is unclear whether by "earlier" Dehejia is refer- ring to the earlier (that is, pre-Kusana) artistic tradition that preceded the creation of this carving or to a practice of homage to a wheel-topped pillar that existed prior to the lifetime of the Buddha. In other words, it is not clear whether her use of the term earlifr refers to the date of the carving or to the history of the subject matter it portrays. 49. This situation might, therefore, be parallel to the case of the Prasenajit scene that Dehejia discusses (fig. 19), where she argues for this viewpoint. See my discussion below. 50. Dehejia does not specify whether she is the first to coin this phrase or whether the idea has been proposed by an earlier author. 51. Though not acknowledged by Dehejia, this sec- tion is heavily dependent upon my work. See S. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art." 52. The term p#t.hais more appropriate in the Buddhist context. I did not know this at the time I wrote Art of Ancient India but corrected the terminology in my ArtJournal article. 53. Rather than saying that the bodhi tree refresents Bodh Gaya, or the wheel-crowned pillar represents Sarnath, I would say that these motifs are key identifying elements in compositions in which sacred sites are depicted. 54. In spite of my general concurrence regarding the subject matter, I feel that Dehejia overstates the case when she appeals to universal agreement as a source of authority for the identification of these scenes. For example, of her fig. 14 (my fig. 11) Dehejia says that There is universal agreement that" (57) and with regard to the second scene, which she does not illustrate, she says: "The second Asokan episode. . . as everyone agrees" (57). Even if it could be ascertained that "everyone agrees" about the identification of these scenes, "every- one" could still be wrong. The correctness of an interpretation does not depend upon how many people agree with it or the assertivenesswith which it is stated. 55. Other than those that are, of course, inherent in the tree itself. 56. John S. Strong, The Legend of King Moka: A Study and Translation of the A?ok&amp;vad&amp;na [hereafter Asok&amp;vadana] (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983), 266. 57. Strong, Asokavadana, 250. 58. It is not clear whether the term caitya refers specif- ically to the type of building we commonly call a caitya (i.e., a caitya hall). 59. Strong suggests that the statement that the tree returned to its normal state in the Quinquennial story might be an interpolation from the Tisyaraksita story. See Strong, Asokavadana, 266 n. 48. But this cannot explain Dehejia's confusion since the Asokhvadanaisvery clear regardingwhich incident is being described. In the Tisyaraksita story, Asoka's Queen TiFyarak4itl becomesjealous of "bodhi," whom she mistakes for another woman that she assumes Asoka loves. Wishing to destroy "bodhi," TiFyaraksit! asks another woman to put a thread on the tree to cause it to wither. When the queen learns that bodhi is not another woman, she regrets what she has done and requests that the thread be removed. The woman who had assisted the queen previously carried out this newer instruction and also watered the tree with a thousand pitchers of milk a day until the tree was restored. See Strong, Asokavad7ina, 257-</page><page sequence="40">150 SUSAN L HUNTINGTON 58. According to this version of the TiFyaraksita story, the tree was lustrated by the woman who had caused the tree towither, and, therefore, the SAincT relief, which shows Asoka, not a woman, could not be the same. Based on the Aiokavadana, the Snidcl relief is more likely to represent the Quinquennial Festival. 60. See Alfred Foucher's writings in John Marshall and Alfred Foucher, The Monuments of Siinchi, 3 vols. (Calcutta: Manager of Publications, 1940; rpt., Delhi: Swati Publications, 1982), 1:212. 61. The inscription on the stipa depicted in the center of the relief does not identify the subject of the composition but is dedicative in nature. It reads: "Aya-Cu4asa dhamakathikasa atevasino Balamitrasa danam" (The gift of Balamitra, a pupil of the Preacher of the Law Aya-Cuda [Arya-CGcla or Arya Kshudra]). See Marshall and Foucher, The Monuments of Siifchr, 1:342, inscr. 399; vol. 3, pl. 134. 62. Strong, Asokavadana, 111-12. 63. This does not mean that there is no richness of meanings or layers of meanings or metaphoric meanings but rather that there is no direct and overt use of symbols or emblems as equivalents of something else in this context. Further, I do not intend to imply that there is not a "higher" or paradigmatic meaning. 64. This theme and others that I mention briefly in this article will be developed and substantiated in my forthcoming book. I mention them here not with the idea of offering my proof but to enable the reader to understand the different direction my work takes from previous interpretations of the artistic remains. 65. Strong, Asokhivadana, 113. Strong also suggests that the Ramagrama story demonstrates Asoka's imperfection since he was unable to obtain the relics from the nagas, therefore rendering his collection of the relics incomplete (p. 113). 66. Strong, Alokdvaddna, 109-10. The number 84,000 is a conventional Buddhist number. The actual number of stiipas constructed by A?oka is un- known. This actprobably also consecrated Asoka's empire with the ultimate symbols of Buddhist authority, a feat that later kings throughout the Buddhist world attempted to duplicate, though never so extensively. 67. Strong, Aiokavad&amp;lna, 221 and 110, especially for the significance to Asoka regarding the relics. 68. S. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art," 405. 69. Dehejia says that some reliefs show the stuipa and the pillar as memorials, but she illustrates not only a stuipa and a pillar but also a bodhi tree as examples of the type. The reader is left not knowingwhether the stuipa and pillar are used as examples of types or whether Dehejia had neglected to list other possibilities (57-58). 70. I would modify this statement to say that these sacred objects might indeed indicate the presence of the Buddha at the site, but they are not substi- tutes for his physical form. 71. S. Huntington, Art of Ancient India, 100, and fig. 6.11. Dehejia does not cite my interpreta- tion of the relief; however, she criticizes an interpretation offered byJohn C. Huntington (66 n. 35). 72. S. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art," 407. 73. I have cited the passage in the Mahaparinibbana suttanta wherein the Buddha entrusts the relics to the laity, not the clergy. S. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art," 408 n. 34. See also T. W. Rhys Davids, trans., 'The Maha-Parinibbana Suttanta," in Buddhist Suttas, Sacred Books of the East, vol. 11 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1881; rpt., Del- hi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1968), 131-36. Dehejia acknowledges the same passage (59) but states that Buddhological research shows that the clergy were also involved in relic worship. As I explain in the text, I do not argue with this evidence but refer only to what is portrayed in the art. 74. S. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art," 403. 75. See S. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art," 407. 76. A major form of documentation for the extensive- ness of pilgrimage and emphasis on sacred pif has comes from the many pilgrims' accounts and records that survive. In S. Huntington, "Early Bud- dhist Art," 407, for example, I quote the famous thirteenth-century monk Dharmasvamin's poi- gnant account of his visit to Bodh Gaya. 77. This is a theme I discuss in detail in my book. 78. See, for example, S. Huntington, Art of Ancient India, figs. 8.24 (one figure to each side of the lotus pedestal), 10.18, 10.19, and 12.18. 79. Dehejia is counting according to the images she reads that way; I am counting others into the group. She also does not explain whether, for</page><page sequence="41">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 151 example, at Bhirhut she means there were six to eight total or six to eight in the approximately one- fourth of the monument that has survived. 80. The meaning of this portion of Dehejia's sentence is unclear to me. Does she mean "emphasis on life of the Buddha"? 81. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art," 405. 82. The examples that Dehejia cites in her text to support her viewpoint do not seem to lend cre- dence to her statement. That is, Asoka's interviews with beings at the site who had seen the Buddha during his lifetime only suggest A?oka's desire to learn more about the Buddha but do not prove thatA?oka's pilgrimage emphasized the Buddha's physical form. 83. Strong, Asokavadana, 244. Aoka was not under the illusion that he would see the Buddha. 84. What does it mean to "experience the Buddha himself in all his glory"? 85. S. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art," 402-3. See also below regarding "time and place." Dehejia does not refer to my work regarding this image. 86. Dehejia suggests (60) that the Buddha image in the second sculpture is made of metal, but it is unclear how this can be inferred from the drawing. 87. How can the fact that a stftpa shows a circular medallion provide evidence that the scene repre- sents a local site? It should also be noted that the Arnaravatli remains have notyielded medallions as separate roundels but rather that depictions of roundels appear in other sculptural compositions. 88. Because Dehejia uses the phrase "of the faith" in her text (45), I include it here. Also see n. 27 above for my comments regarding the use of the term faith as a description of the Buddhist religious complex. 89. She does not specify which tree, but it may be presumed that she means the bodhi tree here. 90. At this point in her text, she does not suggest any meanings for the stuipa. Because she has used the triad of the tree, the pillar, and the stujpa through- out her article, it is unclear whether Dehejia has deliberately avoided telling what the stftpa repre- sents here or if this was just an inadvertent omis- sion. As mentioned previously, it is also unclear whether she intended to omit the possibility of other motifs, such as the cakra, the throne, and the parasol. Further, she assumes thatSarnath and the first sermon would always be shown by a pillar, not a cakra, but this is not documented. 91. See S. Huntington, Art of Ancient India, figs. 6.4 and 6.10 for illustrations. Some of the compositions on these blocks are clearly scenes of layworship at sacred sites. See Marshall and Fouch- er, The Monuments of Si5ichi, vol. 2, pls. 26 (scene showing worship of a wheel installed on an altar); 27 (scene at top that shows worship of a pillar topped by a wheel and addorsed lion capital); and 32 (lower scene, which shows worship of a stupa), to cite just a few. 92. It might represent a site in the Bactro-Gandhara region itself. Chinese pilgrim accounts reveal that there were numerous places throughout the Bac- tro-Gandhara region where visitors could revere sacred objects thatwere reputed to have been used by the Buddha and places he was said to have visited. See, for example, Xuanzang's account of the Gandhara region (Beal, Buddhist Records of the Western World, 1:99). Some of the sacred sites are reputed to be places where the Buddha had lived during his past lives. (See, for example, Beal, Buddhist Records of the Western World, 1: 1 10.) 93. She further states that there are two hundred or more dome slabs about eleven by three feet, the compositions of which were divided into three registers. During the final phase of embellishment of the stuipa, she claims, their design followed a standard repetitive scheme. In an endnote (n. 42) following her mention of the final phase of embel- lishment of the stutpa, she states that the earlier slabs are decorated with a variety of subjects but that the later slabs all conform to the scheme she discusses and illustrates with her fig. 24. However, it is not explained how many of the two hundred or more slabs belong to the earlierversus later phases (that is, how many slabs actually have the fig. 24 design) nor her criteria for determining which examples belong to which phase. From what I have seen of the Amaravatl remains in the three main collections housing these materials (at the Madras Museum, the Amarlvatl Site Museum, and the British Museum), I am doubtful that there are almost two hundred nearly identical eleven-foot- high slabs, and, therefore, the impactof the design she cites is not as great as she implies. 94. Here it becomes clear that in this corpus of two hundred slabs, Dehejia is not really talking about one type but about a number of variations. The fact that Dehejia believes that the three so-called "Descent" scenes (the Swat example, the Bharhut relief, and the one on the Mathura carving; figs. 5,</page><page sequence="42">152 SUSAN L. HUNTINGTON 6, and 7) portray the same subject suggests that she may not be taking into account variations among the compositions. 95. Dehejia also claims that the precise interpretation of these slabs "is crucial to an appreciation of the Buddhist message of the site" (64). (Does she mean the message of the monument?) How can the message of the site (or monument) be deter- mined without studying other aspects, such as the main sculptures at the four entrances of the mon- ument, the sculptures at the gateways, identifying the relic contents of the stuipa, studying other structures at the site, and so on? In other words, are these images alone enough to make such a vast interpretation? 96. My assumption is that Dehejia is not attempting to make a distinction here but has simply used differ- entwording. I infer that her intention is to suggest that the prerequisites are for the interpretation of early Buddhist art, not the emblems, and that she intended to say that the second prerequisite for the interpretation of early Buddhist art is to ac- knowledge the multilayered significance of the emblems. 97. Dehejia states, 'There are two critical and comple- mentary prerequisites for the accurate interpreta- tion of early Buddhist art" (45, para. 2). The implication is that these prerequisites are applica- ble to all of the art. However, Dehejia's use of the term frequently in the description of her second prerequisite ("the artists working at the early Bud- dhist sites frequently seem to have intended a conflation of meanings," 45) suggests that she does not believe that the two prerequisites are requisite in every instance. 98. Dehejia's discussion is sometimes unclear as to whether she is talking about two or three levels of meaning. In her explanation of her second pre- requisite, each of the possibilities she cites has only two levels of meaning (46). She introduces the Bharhut relief showing King Prasenajit (fig. 19; her fig. 1) by saying: "Significantly, a double layer of meaning appears to inform the greater number of narrative reliefs at Bharhut, Sanchi, and other early Buddhist sites" (46). But her explanation of this panel provides three levels of meaning (47). 99. Luders, Bharhut Inscriptions, 113, no. B39. Dehejia does not provide a transliteration of the inscrip- tion. Luiders translates the inscription "King Pasena- ji, the Kosala," rather than "of Kosala," as given by Dehejia. 100.Luders, Bharhut Inscriptions, 113, no. B38. Dehejia's transliteration dhammachakodiffers from Luders' dhamachakark. 101. To be accurate, there is no such thing as com- pletely internal evidence; that is, we read into the composition things we know from the world outside the composition, for example, that the structure is a building, that the trees are trees, that the wheel is the type of Buddhist wheel we know from other experiences, and so on. What I mean by internal evidence, though, is the compo- nents that are actually in the composition and the physical properties of the object. 102.It may be inferred from literary and historical sources that the king might ride in a chariot, and, therefore, it is likely that the central figure in the chariot represents Prasenajit. Additionally, the two large figures in the hall are likely both to represent the king, who is thus shown twice as he performs his circumambulatory devotions to the wheel. 103. In light of the virtual absence of textual, inscrip- tional, literary, or other evidence in Dehejia's article, one of the most perplexing interpretations she offers is her identification of three male fig- ures at the bottom right of the composition she illustrates as her fig. 8 as representing "three gods hovering anxiously over the weakened Buddha' (53). Because the figures are not clearly identifi- able as gods, because they do not look anxious, because they do not appear to be hovering, and because there is no weakened Buddha in the scene, it is necessary that external evidence be employed to support such an identification. 104. She says that the scene shows the actual historical event in which the monarch visited the Buddha at Prasenajit's capital of Srivastl and listened to his sermon. 105. It is unclear to me why the idea of a nonfigural emblem is linked with emphasis on the Law. There is no inherent reason why the emphasis on the Buddha's teachings cannot be communicated through figural means as well. This may be a holdover from thinkingwithin the aniconic frame- work. 106.

Although an early believer in aniconism, Cunning- ham was not the first to articulate the theory fully. 108.The Buddha did not meditate for six years under the bodhi tree.

However, other venues are also named, such as a market town called Medajumpa. See Horner, Collection of the Middle Length Sayings, 2:302. 114. At the time of the Buddha (and of Prasenajit), the Kosala kingdom included Varanasi (and, there- fore, Sarnath).

Sircar, Studies in the Geogra- phy ofAncient and MedievalIndia (2nd ed., rev. and enl., Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1971), 254-55. 115. It is irrelevant to my position whether the relief shows Sarnath or gravastT, since my point would remain the same: it is a scene showing the devo- tions of the king (at a sacred site) and not a life event of gakyamuni Buddha. 116. Beal, Buddhist Records of the Western World, 2:2. Also see Burlingame, Buddhist Legends,40, where King Prasenajit offers to build a pavilion for the Bud- dha, but the Buddha refuses the offer. 117. It might even be argued that, because of the importance of Sarnath, where the Buddha's first sermon was performed, it would have been the first teaching site to have had a monumenterected to commemorate a teaching event. 118. Cunningham, The Stfupa of Bharhut 90. 119. 1 develop andjustify this theme in my forthcoming book. 120. The purpose of including the story of Prasenajit in the Middle Length Sayings is to show his good works and spiritual evolution. See Homer, Collection of the Middle Length Sayings, 2:xvi n. 1. 121. Rockhill, Life of the Buddha, 203, says that the first Tibetan monarch claims descent from Prasenajit, King of Kosala, "one of the early converts and the lifelong friend of the Buddha Gautama." 122. It is unfortunate that a text comparable to the Asohiivadana is not known for King Prasenajit. 123. Illustrated in S. Huntington, Art of Ancient India, fig. 5.16. 124. Dehejia refers to S. Huntington, Art of Ancient India, 99, fig. 6.10, upper relief; andJ. Hunting- ton, "Sowing the Seeds of the Lotus," pt. 4, 30. The term pageantry theory has been coined by Dehejia. NeitherJohn nor I have presented the idea in this way. 125. Since passion plays are specifically connected with the passion (that is, the suffering ofChristbetween the time of the Last Supper and his death) and the crucifixion of Christ, not the life of Christ in general, the analogy that Dehejia infers is particu- larly inappropriate. A Buddhistequivalent, if there is one, would have to be concerned with the death and events associated with the death of the Bud- dha. 126.S. Huntington, Art of Ancient India, 99. Regard- ing John Huntington's reference that Dehejia mentions, he says that a scene at Saiicr may be a "re-enactment of the event at the site before a group of pilgrims."J.

For a typical account of the Great Departure, see Jones, Mahcvastu, 2:155-61; also see Patricia Eichenbaum Karetzky, The Life of the Buddha, An- cient Sciptural and Pictorial Traditions (Lanham, New York, London: University Press of America, 1992), 70-77. 129.Jones, Mahavastu, 2:156, records that the Bodhi- sattva's groom, Chandaka, "cried out at the top of his voice so that the king and all the people in Kapilavastu might be awakened. But no one woke up." This passage emphasizes the soundness with which the people of the city slept. 130. Karetzky, Life of the Buddha, 70. 131. Bactro-Gandharan representations generally show devas uplifting the horse, although often two, rath- er than four, figures are depicted. For examples, see S. Huntington, Art of Ancient India, fig. 8.19; Islay Lyons and Harald Ingholt, Gandharan Art in Pakistan (New York: Pantheon Books, 1957), fig. 45. 132. If this scene indeed represents the Great Depar- ture, this figure might be the Bodhisattva's groom, Chandaka. However, it would be peculiar for a groom to be carrying a ritual water vessel. If this is a reenactment, this figure might represent Chan- daka but, assuming that he has a ceremonial role, might appropriately show him carrying a ritual object. 133. Foucher identifies this as a jambu tree. See Mar- shall and Foucher, Monuments of Sa&amp;icht, vol. 2, text opposite pl. 40. 134. EdwardJ. Thomas, TheLife of the Buddha as Legend and History (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1927; rpt., 3rd ed., 1969), 55. The Lalitavistara records a turning-around place of the Bodhisatt- va's groom, Chandaka. See Bays, The Voice of the Buddha, 1:339. 135. Thomas, Life ofthe Buddha, 55. Thomas also claims that according to one version of the story, Kan thaka did not turn around (p. 56), but the earth did (p. 55). Pali texts record this story as relating to the Buddha Vipassin. (Thomas, Life of the Buddha, 55.) The lives of each of the m&amp;nui Buddhas are held to be identical in Buddhist theory, though not every text recounts each of the life stories in detail for each Buddha. 136. My suggestion that this may be a reenactment occurrring at the very place of the departure, Kapilavastu, implies that the celebration might be related to activities at important Buddhist sites. Dehejia's perception of the "site theory" and the "pageantry theory" as distinct, unrelated subjects does not take the full implications of my proposal into account. 137. S. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art," 405. 138.I suggest that Dehejia's use of the word whole overstates the case. Most devotees probably had more than one purpose in going to a stuApa- perhaps the principal and "authentic" one was to be in the presence of Buddhist relics, but there are many others, including social and political, that must be taken into account when understanding the phenomenon and its popularity throughout the centuries. 139. S. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art," 405. 140. Indeed, while it might be a bias of today's art- collecting, art-appreciating world that a golden image of a Buddha might have more "value" than a portion of his ashes, to practicing Buddhists throughout the Buddhist world and throughout Buddhist history, the relic would be the greater treasure. 141. This phenomenon is discussed in my forthcoming book. 142. I specifically add "architecture" here. It is some- times forgotten in the analysis of individual com- positions, such as those illustrated by Dehejia in her article or by me in "Early Buddhist Art" and here, that these reliefs adorned structures that were built for purposes (often, to house relics) and that these purposes must be taken into account when analyzing the art. 143. Dehejia here again addresses my work. See S. Huntington, Art of Ancient India, 70. 144.I believe she means early Buddhist art of In- dia. 145. In this case Dehejia cites my work, referring to a statement I made in "Early Buddhist Art," 405, which she also quotes in her n. 6. What I say there is: "Essentially, I suggest that the early Buddhist art of India was not primarily concerned with the biography of 91kyamuni Buddha, as has been assumed for so many decades." 146. Also see discussion above.</page><page sequence="45">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS: ANOTHER LOOK 155 147. It is unclear here whether she is using Bharhut as an example or whether she is implying that this situation is applicable only at Bharhut. 148. The source of the "time and place" idea is S. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art," 402-3. 149. S. Huntington, "Early BuddhistArt,"402. This state- ment is then further clarified by the discussion that follows. 150. The pluralization of the word proponentis puzzling since I do not know of anyone beside myself who has discussed the "time and place" concept. 151. Dehejia's statement is unclear. While she (in- correctly) infers that I have said that both time and place are absent from "aniconic" scenes, she assumes that I would interpret such "anicon- ic" renderings as "site scenes," thereby, I suggest, implying that "place" is not absent. (After all, a site is a place.) 152. Here she shows that she does not apparently be- lieve thateventsin the life ofA?oka are Buddha life events. However, the significance of a representa- tion of an event in the life of A?oka is not made clear here since the idea was never discussed in her text, and it is not specified how this subject relates to the notions of multivalency or of aniconism. 153. Early proponents of the aniconic theory related the practice to HinayAna Buddhism, assuming thatHinayAnists had a doctrinal prohibition against creating Buddha images. Concomitantly, it was believed that Mahayana Buddhists were responsi- ble for the introduction of the Buddha image into the art. It is now known that HInayanists used images as well and that Hinayana literature does not contain evidence of widespread (if any) prohi- bition against Buddha imagery. Therefore, one of the cornerstones of the aniconic theory-the pre- supposition of a widespread prohibition against creating images-is insupportable. I discussed the fallaciousness of the long-held Hinayana prohibi- tion model in my "Early Buddhist Art," 401-2. Dehejia agrees that the old Hinayana-Mahayana model must be abandoned (47). 154. I use the term in quotes since, if the phenomenon exists, I nonetheless propose that the name it has been given is inappropriate. First, I do not believe that a phenomenon should be defined according to what it is not ("not an icon"); second, since the term is associated with the concept of deification, itis inappropriate for the Buddha. See n. 28 above. 155.Dehejia's presupposition that I see only two alternatives to what have been traditionally iden- tified as aniconic scenes, namely a "site" interpre- tation and the "pageantry" interpretation, is sim- ply not correct. My forthcoming book, and hopefully this article to some extent, will make it clear that I see a number of alternative interpreta- tions. That I have allowed for-and am thoroughly concerned with-other types of subjects is clear in the Art Journal article, where I say: "This article presents some of my findings in a preliminary fash- ion by focusing on one type of representation. Specifically, I will examine a type of relief that is among those that are usually said to illustrate scenes from the life of the Buddha, with the Buddha, however, not depicted. It is possible that most, if not all, of these compositions do not repre- sent events in the life of the Buddha at all, but rather portray worship and adoration at sa- cred Buddhist sites" (S. Huntington, "Early Bud- dhistArt," 402; italics added here). When I present what Dehejia calls "the pageantry idea" in Art of Ancient India, I do not state that I conceive of pageantry scenes as one of only two alternative explanations for the so-called aniconic scenes. Further, although Dehejia recognizes what she calls the "pageantry" theory in her article, the introduction to her article implies a polarity be- tween what she calls the "totally aniconic interpre- tation of the early 1900s [and] the somewhat restrictive site-oriented interpretation of this last decade" (45). Her statementimplies that the "site" interpretation was offered as a sole alternative to aniconism. 156. When Asoka or other early kings erected pillars, surmounted by lions, cakras, and other motifs, these probably represent emblematic configura- tions. However, when these pillars are later depict- ed in artistic renderings at Saiici, Bharhut, and other sites, often with worshipers adoring them and circumambulating them, they serve a narra- tive, rather than emblematic, purpose. 157. The role of my research in the formulation of Dehejia's ideas is not clearly defined in her text and notes. I am aware that Dehejia is publishing a book in which much of what is published in her article serves as a chapter. I hope that acknowledg- ment of Dehejia's derivations from my work are therein sufficiently cited. In addition to the site theory, which Dehejia incorporates as a major aspect of her work, her borrowing of the term silea, her reference to "time and place," and other themes from mywork should be cited. Aside from the issue of crediting scholar(s) for their contributions, it is essential to future generations that the derivation of scholarly ideas be clearly presented and ac- knowledged so that the evolution of scholarly</page><page sequence="46">156 SUSAN L. HUNTINGTON thinking may be traced. 158. In his essay entitled 'The Beginnings of Buddhist Art," Foucher states: "It is no longer a secret to anyone that the regular sweep of this evolution [the Indic art of Saiici and related sites] was brusquely interrupted by a veritable artistic cata- clysm. The Hellenized sculptors of the northwest, strangers to the native tradition of Central India, satisfied to the full; and even outwent, thewishes of their Buddhist patrons by creating for their use the Indo-Greek type of Buddha. Immediately their colleagues of the low country, seduced by this wonderful innovation, greeted with no less enthu- siasm than the laity the rupture of the magic charm which had weighed so heavily and so long upon the ancient Buddhist school."
