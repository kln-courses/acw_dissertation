<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL ANALYSIS Issue 45(1) April 2001 PAIN AND 'PROGRESS': Revisiting Botol Sorcery in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea Michael Nihill Notions such as sorcery — and their connection to the experience of pain that requires remedy through ritual — are common images when once relatively autonomous tribal or peasant peoples are incorporated into (post-) colonial states. These concerns, in turn, are multiply interconnected with power and its changing forms. This article concerns the Anganen speakers of the Southern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea. It addresses how pain may be seen as both the expression and experiential location of the complexities of post-colonialism. The Anganen seek to be part of this introduced world of material things but remain largely powerless within it. This marginality is embroiled with Lindenbaum's (1979:125; cf. Lederman 1981:15) description of sorcery as "political epidemiology". Here affliction and what is regarded as its causation reflect wider changes in power and self-interest. This is similar to what Stewart and Strathern (1997:3-4) call the "epidemiology of representations". They are also interested in the "representation of epidemiologies", the cultural construction of physical ailments that may to linked with the human experience of the world and changes to it (Stewart and Strathern 1997:3-4). I link both of these dimensions of affliction to the latest form of sorcery known in the Anganen region. This is botol ("bottle") where materials such as small shards of glass, wire, plastic, and small denominational coins are ensorcelled into the body. Botol causes a lingering, intense pain that requires the hiring of a ritual expert from outside the region to remedy. The anthropological study of witchcraft and sorcery has long related them to issues such as power, morality and conflict. As least since Evans-Pritchard's (1937) classic Zande material we know that mystical notions concerning evil are moral discourses. Since a number of writers (eg. Marwick 1964; Turner 1957) relate witchcraft to social and structural conflict. These positions have been slightly rewritten in Africa (Geschiere 1997) and Melanesia (Lattas 1993) as political languages in contemporary settings. The current discussion addresses such issues. There is also a comparative perspective as I compare the Anganen with the Mendi who live to their north-east and who are discussed in a highly insightful paper by Rena Lederman (1981). Much of her discussion applies equally well in the Anganen context. However, there are significant differences between botol in the two regions. After briefly recounting salient aspects of her argument, I consider these differences, especially as they relate to the articulation of inequality. In part, this concerns both the cure and the curer. The Anganen believe that it is possible for the curer to be also a practitioner of botol sorcery; indeed, perhaps he is the cause as well as the curer of any given affliction and is acting in the hope of receiving the substantial fee his cure requires. Alternatively, he may act in concert with some one who wishes harm and is prepared to play for his services, thereby potentially benefiting financially at both ends of the process. The cure involves the curer extracting the afflicting items by placing a K20 note over the 103</page><page sequence="2">painful area in order to remove them with his teeth. As such, pain is through the rubbish (pipia, Tok Pisin) of the new political economy, while its cure features that which is eagerly coveted by the Anganen, large denominational notes. A number of ongoing themes run through the discussion of botol, the Anganen consciousness of the world and their place within it. Botol largely remains a mystery, be it in terms of precisely who the sorcerer is and how both this form of sorcery operates. This mystery is of an unprecedented degree when compared with older sorcery forms that the Anganen use and have confidence in when predicting sorcerers, as they review their relations with others in order to deduce who may wish harm. It is not only in the experience of pain nor the witnessing of those enduring it that the Anganen sense the reality of botol. Even if somewhat vaguely, they imagine it too. Their sense of botol also draws upon their knowledge of their own sorcery procedures, both through similarity and difference, to render this mysterious force comprehensible. Interwoven with this logic is the Anganen understanding of power and its moral deployment. This knowledge is not new, only differently manifested within a history of marginalisation resulting from the forty or so years of the forced inclusion of the Anganen in a capitalist state order. As a metacommentary, to borrow Taussig's (1980) term, on power, it is mystery, memory and imagination that frames how the consciousness of this reality of botol is formed and reinforced. Botol in Mendi Summary can never do justice to the nuances and power of an argument and here I only consider those aspects of Lederman's (1981) article with immediate comparative relevance to botol in Anganen. Her main point is that the impact of capitalism through the monetary economy greatly intensified conflict within what should be sociable relations, such as between clansmen or within relatively stable political alliances. Money is not like other forms of wealth — it is "breakable"; that is, it is divisible but still useful in a way valuables like shells are not. Capitalism introduces new wants within a population, such as consumables purchased from trade-stores. It also generates new forms of wealth produc tion (eg. paid labour) and wealth deployment such as bisnis (Tok Pisin, "business"). Overall, capitalism places great pressure on the moral imperatives bound up in gift exchange and sharing, and this tension leads to increased conflict within those relations that normatively should engage in such reciprocal practices. It is this conflict that underwrites sorcery accusations as well. For Lederman, botol reflects changing patterns of social conflict and changing forms and patterns of power relations, given that it is the younger men who are most likely to engage in paid work and bisnis. Colonialism thus brought a changing expression to sorcery as a "political epidemiology". She (1981:26) concludes: "Implicitly botol also contains a critique of Western society, where the exchange of products — which have become ends in themselves — threatens to overwhelm the indigenous meaning of exchange as the medium through which relations between people are continually expanded, deepened and equalized." Lederman's argument is a forceful integration of the material and the social in changing times. My interests lie not in a critique of this argument but in how the Anganen situation differs from the Mendi, despite the geographic proximity, linguistic affinity and, from what I 104</page><page sequence="3">can construct in Anganen and through comparison with D'Arcy Ryan s (1961) earlier work on the Mendi, similar if not shared forms of sorcery and its cure. The discussion of botol in Anganen will thus, in part, be framed through its similarities and differences to the Mendi situation. It will also be through comparison with these older sorcery forms, as these older forms critically orientate the Anganen understating of this new method of causing harm, again through similarity but mainly through difference. Botol in Anganen and the Lure of the Wild As in Mendi, the Anganen think that botol originated in the outside world. The coast, perhaps Lae, is the most probable location. While the nambis ("seaboard", Tok Pisin) is seen as a dangerous place, the Anganen consider Mt. hagen or Mendi to be the places where they are at greatest risk from botol sorcerers. The reason for this is that these pro vincial capitals are where the Anganen mostly visit when seeking work, selling large amounts of coffee, or purchasing major goods and stocking trade-stores. There is also a less developed sense, that itinerant coffee buyers (nearly always called "Simbu") may practice sorcery as they traverse the countryside. In addition, the older forms of sorcery have originated 'outside'; mostly notably for the Anganen is that which was obtained through trade with the Kewa who live to their south-east. However, there are two major differences that mark the current situation different from that which I could reconstruct before or in the early days of colonialism. The Anganen feared Kewa sorcery but through trade they gained access to Kewa techniques which they could then use in local political struggles. Their initial fear gave way to empowerment. In the past the Kewa typified what the Anganen regard as kera, "wild" (see Nihill 1999). Although innovators themselves in many ways, much that the Anganen regard as powerful stems from the wild, such as the most potent pre-Christian cult, rimbu (Nihill 1996), and from most forms of wealth, such as shells, cassowaries and later money. It is the ability to appropriate these forces in order to use them for the local social good, that underwrites the Anganen capacity to act on the world to a large extent. Thus, while the initial lure of the wild is a sign of the absence of powerful things, it can eventually be appropriated for local empowerment. This is not the case with botol. To their knowledge no one has been able to purchase the techniques needed to be a botol sorcerer, although two Wolamesa men living in Mt. Hagen are known to be curers. While one term, botol pia ("botol doer") refers to both the sorcerer and the ritual expert who cures this affliction, no accusations of botol sorcery have been made against these two men. Overall, the contemporary setting does not replicate the situation that prevailed with the Kewa. Initial fear no long may give way to local empowerment! Botol pia gain substantial financial rewards. Even if they are not the senders of sorcery, as curers they receive payment, perhaps as much as K60 or a pig. (Men going to these urban centres may also pay such men to perform a procedure for protection; K5-10 is about what it costs.) Thus, the directionality of sorcery has changed, going from south to north (and the coast), to post-colonial sites of power. Botol reflects the power structures of Papua New Guinean modernity. Moreover, the knowledge of botol pia underwrites power through both the mysterious and the material, with Anganen powerlessness manifest as 105</page><page sequence="4">trepidation, pain and economic loss. That the curer of sorcery is capable also of being its sender magnifies the power differential as Anganen depend on those who may wish them ill.2 There are a number of contrasts and similarities between the Anganen situation and that which Lederman found among the Mendi. Although perhaps to a lesser degree, there is also an increase in sorcery accusations within what should be positive social relations, such as political alliances and local groups. There is substantial tension between young and older men, especially over money, with older men criticising the indulgence of younger ones for wasting cash on beer and not saving it for gift exchange. The conflict between using money in the two highly regarded practices of exchange and bisnis is also significant. As sorcery is bound up with conflict, it persists among Anganen and deaths are attributed to it. However, I have heard of no death through botol. It is not that the Anganen believe that botol cannot be lethal, only that no death has yet been attributed to it. This situation contrasts with Mendi, as does the fact that they may be practitioners, both as sorcerers and curers. Another pronounced difference between Anganen and Mendi is the relation between botol sorcerer and victim. Sorcery accusations are an internal Mendi phenomenon. In Anganen, botol has a graphic external character, not only in its origin but because Anganen are victims and not senders of botol. Rather, the sorcerer is imagined from a number of possibilities drawn from a diffuse, generalised other — "perhaps the man who lost when playing cards with me, or who was drinking at a club where I was drunk, or the coffee buyer I angered when criticising his price". Perhaps, the motivation may be greed alone, in the hope of securing a chance to cure the victim; the then sorcerer may not act in anger at all. That is, unlike the internal Anganen situation where the standing of relations with others can be reviewed in order to deduce a likely sorcerer, the Anganen feel largely powerless when endeavouring to select the sorcerer with any great confidence. That their traditional divination methods (pulu) also fail to find botol pia compounds this frustration. Any endeavour to account for the rise and acceptance of new beliefs such as botol must be multi-dimensional. However, it seems that the major point of difference underlying this situation of who a likely botol sorcerer may be in Mendi and Anganen lies with the historical dimensions and locations of power. The main source of income for most Anganen is the modest sums they receive from selling coffee. Coffee does not grow well in the Upper Mendi where Lederman undertook fieldwork, although the people there do have some links to the lower altitude Ialibu where coffee does grow. Far more important is the fact that the Anganen feel that the Mendi has enjoyed a far more concerted "development" than they have. This is primarily due to the geographic proximity of the Mendi to the provincial capital of Mendi township; the name itself reflects privilege.3 On the other hand, the Anganen live in the Nembi Valley region, many days walk from the Mendi colonial administration and, for the most part, only seldom receiving 'law and order' and census patrols. "Development" was also hampered in Anganen due to the difficulty in building a viable vehicle road, largely because of the deep descent into the Lai Valley that separates the Mendi and the Nembi Valleys. In many respects, Mendi is Mt. Hagen writ somewhat smaller. The Anganen have long envied Mt. Hageners, let alone those of the nambis, for the wealth they think people there have. Discussions about Hagen frequently concern 106</page><page sequence="5">money. Wealth is not just the selling of coffee, wage labour or expensive purchases but about the huge amounts gambled in card games, the sheer number of people buying goods, huge bride wealths, massive compensations, andbisnis men without peers. Mt. Hagen, then, is very much about money and the new economics . It is just what Anganen is not. Hageners are rich and powerful, while Anganen are poor and peripheral and this situation seems to be increasing as time goes on. The disparity was augmented and largely symbolised by Paias Wingti's rise to power as Prime Minister. He, along with other Highlanders, like Okuk and the plethora of politicians from the coast, demonstrate that the 'outside' has enjoyed the material legacy of colonialism far more than the Anganen. Those populations coming from distant parts, like Mendi or Tari, also dominate Southern High lands politics and while a number of Anganen men have aspired to national or provincial political prominence, none have succeeded. Botol thus reflects the Anganen and Mendi differences concerning power. In Mendi, the power of the 'outside', the state and capitalism, causes conflicts within what should be positive socialities. For the Anganen, the power of the 'outside' empowers outsiders. In turn, the botol sorcery afflictions encode this power differential. Whereas the Mendi have seen the inversion of likely sorcerers from outsiders to insiders, the belief that powerful sorcery is of the 'outside' continues in Anganen. Moreover, this belief has expanded to eventually include the seaboard. The emphasis on wildness has also changed geographically from south to north, from villages scattered throughout dense bush to a town where men must go in order to appropriate the things of power found there. However, the limits of this appropriation highlight Anganen marginality. The lure of the wild still remains and some men are thought to go wild in such places through consuming alcohol and desiring sex with prostitutes (see Nihill 1994). But the appropriation of the spoils of town, like the brevity of intoxication and sex, signals a lack of capacity. Ultimately, the costs, both economic and perhaps physically, through sexually transmitted diseases make men realise the limits of this capacity and the pain and economic loss of botol has the same consequence. Mendi and Anganen are similar concerning botol as both regions increasingly feature the economic rather than the political basis of older sorcery forms. Botol is a meta-commentary on power, but this outside-inside dimension persists in Anganen. For the Anganen, economic greed motivates the botol sorcerer in order for him to enjoy the spoils of town, in contrast to a morally sanctioned attack on an enemy or to avenge a clansman's death. The botol sorcerer is somewhat like the Anganen clandestine sorcerer who immorally attacks someone with whom he should maintain strong social relations. Only now the sorcerer is in the guise of a stranger with whom no Anganen may share a morality reflective of equivalence and equal access to power.4 Moreover, botol not only reflects Anganen marginality in the new political economy, in Anganen consciousness it also partially causes it: the rich get richer at Anganen expense. Fittingly, it is in these urban centres that men fall most vulnerable to this power over which they have little control. Mt. Hagen, Mendi, and the coast, thus stand as potent symbols of the advantage enjoyed by others. There has also been a major change from earlier sorcery forms in terms of which men are likely victims.5 Previously, big men or aspiring big men were most likely to die but now it is the younger men who are most at risk with botol. While this may signal a shift in the 107</page><page sequence="6">relationship between age and power among Anganen men, it is the younger men who most covet what this new order offers. They also have the most mobility and are able to visit these urban centres and, thus, are at greatest risk. As men dominate the public arena, it would seem that only men would be botol sorcerers. While I heard of no account of women as curers, the situation with women sending botol is less clear. In a previous article, (Nihil! 1994), I discuss the images of women that men feel have materially benefited from "development", most notably for the present discussion, are the prostitutes encountered in places like Mt. Hagen. In some respects, prostitution mirrors botol. Pain may follow visits to prostitutes when sexually transmitted diseases are contracted. The mystery of such pain arises from the fact that not all who have sex with prostitutes experience it; similarly, botol does not strike all who visit Hagen, Mendi, and so on. Men also feel that money disappears, again often mysteriously, when they are in town. While all acknowledge that things like drinking beer and procuring prostitutes are expensive indulgences, mystery is still attributed to the depletion of money. It is in this sense that mystery, pain and economic loss may characterize botol and prostitution alike. One possible explanation put forward for these afflictions is that men visiting prostitutes are vulnerable to sorcery; intoxication or sexual desire are seen to fog the brain and thus facilitate an attack. Whether prostitutes themselves have this technique is uncertain but the Anganen think they may and this logic identifies these women as being very different from local women. Some prostitutes are even thought to work in concert with botol sorcerers, perhaps to facilitate them stealing their clients' cash. As I conclude in this article, such 'new women' magnify the sense of Anganen male dis-empowerment. The Anganen say that colonial domination rendered them "like women". It is because some women, such as prostitutes, act "like men" in terms of their autonomy, economic power and access to botol, this sense of dis-empowerment seems all the more real.6 Botol is, therefore, a powerful, multiplex metaphor of the Anganen lot in the contemporary world and a central experiential locale for it. It is because mystery shrouds both the loss of money and the practices of botol, reinforces the power of town dwellers while simultaneously instilling a sense of powerlessness in those Anganen who visit urban centres. It is in this way that mystery, as much as the material, is bound up in the expression and experience of power. Mystery and Botol as Practice Mystery is also a feature of what the Anganen know of (or speculate about) the cause and cure of botol sorcery. Here, the admission of having a little but far from complete knowledge makes that which is unknown appear to be all the more powerful. Some Anganen think that the method of sending botol sorcery is like Anganen rom sorcery, where extraneous objects are inserted into bodies via various techniques. With botol, shards of glass, wire and other small pieces of metal, plastic, and one or two toea coins enter the body. These objects can be placed in bottles, especially beer bottles, from which the unsuspecting victim drinks. It is for this reason alone that men do not share beer from the same bottle. However, most Anganen think that this procedure of botol involves smoke, perhaps tobacco, combined with the bark of an unknown coastal tree. This combination is blown 108</page><page sequence="7">into the eyes or mouth of the victim, blinding him so that these objects can be inserted. Others think that the smoke may actually carry these objects into the body through the eyes or mouth or over the skin of what is to be the afflicted region. Alternatively, others suggest that botol may be similar to the other main Anganen sorcery form, niambu. This involves exuviae (hair, fingernails, traces of saliva on scraps of food or in discarded bottles, even semen) that retain an essence of the person. Irrespective of the method suggested, the point to note is how botol remains mysterious as a practice. The existing understandings of sorcery provide a framework for imagining botol but not one explanation is capable of fully explaining it.7 It is through witnessing botol that the Anganen have acquired a more detailed knowledge of its cure (botol resi, "botol remove"), although much still remains uncertain. Botol afflictions do not respond to medical treatments at the haus sik (health centre, Tok Pisin), so there is seen to be no alternative but to hire a botol pia ritual expert to avert the pain. Just as there are a number of ritual experts, the Anganen say that they have heard of a number of different techniques. What follows, covers the main points generally agreed upon for what is, in essence, a simple procedure. The ritual expert begins by thoroughly washing the afflicted area with soap. He then blows smoke onto the region to 'sensitize' it. This is done, either with commercially manufactured cigarettes or with the burning of a substance of unknown origin in a pipe along with tobacco. Having sensitized the region, the curer then feels for the objects and manipulates the flesh until the objects are close enough to the skin to be accessible. He then places a K20 note over the area and extracts the objects with his teeth, spitting them into a bowl or banana leaf for the victim and others to see. When all objects have been removed, they are then burnt so they cannot be used again in another sorcery attack through niambu. While the use of money is the main issue I examine here, it is worth considering the role of smoke that features in both the method of attack and the cure of botol. Smoke, along with other phenomena, such as the smell and steam of cooked food, form what I call a category of liminal entities that figure often in Anganen ritual. I call them liminal, not only because they empower transformation but also because they have a sensory impact that lacks any persistent materiality. These liminal entities also includes some forms of speech. In the past, the Anganen have used ritual languages wherein 'talk' is "hidden" (eg., see Franklin 1978:420-44 for the nearby Kewa). Such language is allegorical or comprised of words, either not used in day to day speech or with meanings different from that of conventional language. Prayer, too, is "hidden", as a personal communication with God or the Virgin Mary. The ethereal quality of smoke, smell and steam are similar to these forms of influential talk in that their reality lacks any enduring materiality. Indeed, these liminal entities also correspond, in many respects, with that which ritual endeavours to transform or affect — the mystic basis of illness and the presence but intangibility of the spiritual agencies of the ancestors or God that animal sacrifice or opa (Tok Pisin "offering")8 may influence. Thus, with affliction there is a correspondence between cause and cure in terms of the intangible, the ethereal and the mystical and all constitute crucial aspects of the Anganen understanding of the reality of the world. Indeed, despite its profound material connotations in Western 109</page><page sequence="8">thought, money itself may have similar qualities within Anganen logic. The Magic of Money Money was first introduced into the Anganen region in the nineteen sixties. Previously, government officers and especially the local Catholic missionaries, paid for land, labour and produce with pearl shells. The shift to money was part of a larger strategy aimed at "development", namely, that peoples such as the Anganen needed to 'manage' money; they needed to engage with the capitalist economy, as increasingly they became active participants as producers and consumers. However, from the time of its introduction in Anganen, money has always had more than just the status of a medium designed to facilitate financial transactions,9 albeit with changing historical specificities. It is these changing historical specificities that I now consider, as they pertain to botol sorcery. Initially, Australian coins supplanted pearl shells. As elsewhere in the Highlands (eg., see Clark 2000), coins were called "stone" due to their hardness and were seen to be similar to ancestral cult stones which are regarded as fonts of power. In Anganen, coins were also strongly compared to pearl shells. In part, this logic evolved from historical relations as both shells and coins were used for the same purpose by the Australians. In part, it was also due to the physical resemblances based on roundness, sheen, and the importance of surface markings. Coins were readily incorporated into exchanges such as bride wealth, along side shells, pigs, and other valuables. This incorporation of coins within Anganen exchange practices did not last long. Notes increasingly circulated in the Lai-Nembi region and rapidly superseded coins, making them redundant for exchange purposes.10 Coins became categorized as "female" in opposition to the "maleness" of notes. Coins could only circulate in the mundane world of petty transactions such as the ten toea piles of sweet potato that women sell at the local market or the purchase of small items from trade-stores. While notes could circulate in the arena of economic transactions, especially with wage labour, coffee sales and the larger economic purchases made in town. However, twenty (and to a far lesser extent ten) kina notes were also used in gift exchange. In the early eighties, the Anganen went to great lengths to ensure that new or at least clean notes were used in exchange (for an extended discussion, see Nihill 1989a). These notes were directly compared to pearl shells once again. Shells should be shiny and beautifully presented on bright green leaves for contrast; money was also splendidly exhibited as "trees". These are pyramid-like structures made out of split lengths of cane with the notes attached ; the lengths are tied together with vine at the ends. The identification with pearl shells was so strong that not only were K20 notes referred to as sekere nonopi ("pearl shell like") but in some exchanges the mediums were inter changeable. For instance, in the incremental second phase of mortuary exchange following direct compensation, a compensation receiver could, say, eventually get a shell and a K20 note in response to his earlier gift of either a shell or a K20 note (see Nihill 1991). However, like elsewhere in the Highlands, this situation did not last and the economic — the sheer purchasing power of money — emerged to dominate the meaning of notes. Much of the rich aesthetic value previously assigned to money has been lost. Correspondingly, 110</page><page sequence="9">pearl shells are all but redundant as an exchange medium. Some Anganen attribute these changes to dealing with outsiders in exchange, such as Simbu men marrying Anganen women with bride wealth or Anganen men marrying the Hagen women they meet while working in the Western Highlands. Nonetheless, the economic is still not the only value the Anganen attach to money. While power of money stems from a status constituted in the wider Papua New Guinea political economy, it still retains capacities that are absent for money in Western economies. Both in its affliction and in its cure, botol illustrates this point. I will consider money's role in the cure first. For the Anganen, the power of money lies in its capacity for conversion. By this, I do not simply mean economic instrumentality; that is, it is not just that labour or produce can be converted into cash which can then be converted into purchased goods. All wealth in Anganen has the power for conversion and this logic stems directly from the role of wealth in gift exchange. Bride wealth converts the unmarried into the married; any form of compensation may convert the angry into the appeased; or mortuary compensations assist in transforming ghosts angered by their deaths into potentially productive ancestors. The Anganen response to sickness also demonstrates this logic. For instance, when a child or adult woman falls ill, a father or husband may hold what is called an angare. Here disgruntled relatives who may be inadvertently bewitching people are asked to reveal any displeasure they have. Food is served and people can be compensated with wealth if the angare holder is seen to be the cause of the anger. In the past, pigs were used in sacrifice. Their transformation, notably from raw into cooked, was seen to appease the spirits thought to be sending the sickness through the consumption of the smell and smoke of the pork. The afflicted person also eats part of the cooked meat and this, also, is seen as a powerful remedy. With the abandonment of the spirit houses in which these sacrifice took place, the giving of wealth, opa, in church is now seen to serve the same purpose. In all instances, the proper deployment of what the Anganen call epeya, "good things", wealth and food, is seen to convert the sick into the healthy. The incorporation of money into exchange and opa demonstrates that wealth s capacity for conversion persists. Wealth is also the mechanism through which botol resi works: the K20 note converts the rubbish inside the body to a manifestation perceived to be outside the body and with this practice, the afflicted becomes transformed into the healthy. Anganen believe that these items may be extracted without the loss of blood and this process underwrites both the curer's skill and money's potency. However, the significance of blood extends beyond this context. Like the bright red ochre rubbed onto pearl shells, kupa, the generic term for blood, denotes the vibrant red that visually dominates the K20 note. Good exchange (and the spilling of actual blood in sacrifice) also promotes both kinship and, most importantly here, individual health. There appears to be a sympathetic transfer of qualities: the kupa redness of blood and kinship and, thus, life extends to the afflicted individual. This transference is the magic of money; for the Anganen, this is "work" of money. Money makes brides wives, the sick healthy and, in botol resi, it mediates the inside and outside, both of the afflicted person's body and the power relations implicated in this sorcery's cause. Ultimately, it results in further conversion: the rich into the richer, the poor into the poorer. The inverse of this positive power and converting potential of notes, that is, that money Ill</page><page sequence="10">may cause harm in the converting of the healthy into the afflicted, also applies to botol. This inversion is, likewise, a feature of the potency of money. Unlike the case in Mendi, one and two toea coins may also enter the body along with wire, shards of glass and so on. There are two, ultimately interrelated points to this belief, that I will initially address separately. It is later in this paper that I consider these coins as part the category of items used in botol, firstly, I address the relevance of the gendered attributes of money in Anganen. The Anganen retain and, in this instance, elaborate upon notions of pollution. Anganen men believe that substances such as menstrual blood or parturient fluids are inimical to their health. For instance, wives angry with their husbands and wishing to end a marriage may either enlist the support of their brothers or lovers to perform sorcery or contaminate a man's food with menstrual blood. The latter is seen as a form of rom sorcery where deliberately contaminated items are given for consumption. Rom is the only type of sorcery directly available to women and the only one unaccessible to Anganen men until botol. The invasion of male bodies by one and two toea coins is, in part, a new form of pollution in that it is the prototypically "female" coins that contaminate their bodies. Botol resi is, therefore, not only a ritual of affliction, it is also specifically a rite of purification. However, it is because this practice entails the loss of relatively large amounts of money that the ritual has gender implications. Larger denominations of cash are "male" and their enforced loss is thus emasculating. The idiom of male dis-empowerment, namely that things like colonial domination and economic marginality render Anganen men "like women", furthers the gender dimensions of botol. Heavy Things While the Anganen regard money as a "good thing', they also consider money, along with other items whose origins are in Western production, as "strong", puri, or "heavy", kend.u Lederman (1981:23) notes that the Mendi characterize items used in the cure of botol as "strong". The Mendi cure involves Western products, like store-bought tobacco rolled in newspaper and the consumption of instant coffee and tinned beef. However, it seems that monetary notes are not used.12 Apart from the possibility of commercial brands of ready made cigarettes, soap and the K20 note, the cure suggested by most of the Anganen does not include Western products. But while they do not use Western products in curing sorcery afflictions, the Anganen do deploy them in new forms of jural procedure called givim baibel (Tok Pisin, "giving a Bible"). While historically, givim baibel is a new phenomenon, in many respects it builds on and integrates two existing procedures in Anganen. One is paremti which may be staged, for instance, if a man's pig mysteriously dies. He invites kin and neighbours, including those whom he may feel harbour grudges against him, to consume a small part of the cooked pork of the beast. The guilty parties will either shun the invitation or fall ill if they eat this meat. The other procedure is yapare men, a complex ritual but some aspects of it are relevant to this discussion. Yapare men occurs when an insulted man confronts his antagonist and this man refuses to offer compensation. The aggrieved man may then challenge him to a yapare men. This is preferable to physical violence or sorcery but causes great concern as 112</page><page sequence="11">it is extremely dangerous. The men take pork to the most potent and possibly the only still operational cult house at the eastern end of the Nembi Plateau.13 They spend the night and consume part of the meat. If the challenger has made false allegation, he or members of his family fall ill and may die. The same fate awaits the man who gave insult, if this was actually the case. Givim baibel involves the deduction of guilt through consumption, and like yapare men involves the conscious summoning of spiritual agents, in this instance, God. The ritual is practised to resolve conflict but only the guilty person is at risk. A man angry with another sends him a baibel (which is not the full version of the Bible but some form of religious depiction on paper). This action signals his disgust with this man. If the recipient feels he has no case to answer or wishes to challenge his accuser's courage, he sends it back. The first man can now challenge him to givim baibel. This usually takes place in the main market adjacent to the Det mission station and close to the main church. Items such as Wopa biscuits or manufactured cigarettes are purchased from the trade-stores on the edge of the market. These foods must be "new" (nupela kai kai in Tok Pisin, na mbali, "white peoples' food" in Anganen). Each man consumes the products and the person falling ill is seen to be the guilty party who can then redeem himself through compensation and opa. Paremti, yapare men, givim baibel and the sorcery types ot rom (where contamination is via consumption), niambu (with the by-products of consumption like saliva or excreta) and botol all demonstrate that for the Anganen, consumption is more than any local sense of nutrition, that is the conceived inherent qualities of any food type. Consumption is a powerful vehicle that has to potential to manifest extreme effects upon the consumer. These effects may be positive, as when people consume food grown on their land, infused with ancestral fertility or the transubstantiation of communion. Equally, food may be dangerous, when incorporated ritually into mystical procedures such as sorcery and these jural procedures. Food is the most obvious link of the external world to the constitution ot the individual. As such, the historical dimensions and changes to the articulation of power also find expression in the physical being of the person. Again this idea is not new. Clearly, givim baibel is a form of syncretism wherein an existing orientation to the world takes on new content and perhaps new consequences in the post-colonial setting. However, the role of na mbali has seen a shift in the locus of power, thus linking it both to botol and its remedy. It is this link that permits me to integrate the various sections of my discussion to the dimensions of power and the material items that botol features. Botol, Metaphors of Power and Anganen Consciousness Michael Taussig's (1980) The Devil and Commodity Fetishism in South America, remains a classic piece of historical anthropology. Of course, it is not without its critics. For instance, T. Turner (1986) questions whether the ubiquitous belief in the Devil and material reward or the baptism of money in the Cauca Valley are meta-commentaries on capitalism per se or on its impact on individual self-interest and the problems in maintaining social relations. In short, whether these beliefs comment directly on the systemic properties of capitalism, such as exchange value and commodity fetishism or on its impact. In Anganen, 113</page><page sequence="12">the sorcery beliefs comment on the latter, at least on an exegetical level. The Anganen do not find capitalism evil at all. Rather, at least through their sense of capitalism as material objects that include money, the system has produced a sense of wonderment and desire. The problem facing the Anganen is not capitalism but their marginality to it, especially in relation to those they believe have fared much better than they. The material dimensions of power stemming from capitalism and the colonial and post-colonial state have human form: politicians, successful bisnis men, many Whites, coffee buyers and prostitutes or botol pia living in town. It is at this material reality that the moral critique is framed, as all are seen as mercenary. None of these parties offer a moral equivalence despite the Anganen desire for this to be the case. Botol sorcery is also linked to another fundamental dimensions of the Anganen modernist experience. On a general level, physical pain was a common reference I received when discussing the Anganen experience of colonialism. This is most apparent with new forms of labour, forced or voluntary, which are often regarded as far more onerous than home production. The Anganen recount that road building, an early instrument utilised by the Australians for "development" and as punishment, such as when they resumed tribal fighting but a few years after "pacification", was excruciating. So, too, is wage labour, especially plantation work regarded as painftil. It may be the case that such work is harder, but this is bound up in more than just physical toil. In nearly all of the narratives, the men note also their dislike of the hierarchy that underpins these work practices. The Anganen are at the bottom of this hierarchy while those making them work hard are above them. Here, alienation is the lack of autonomy, magnified by a strong Anganen male chauvinism and by the experience of autonomy in home production and exchange. They look back on the early days of colonial control with bitterness: "They did not treat us like men, they would not listen to our talk, they treated us like dogs, yelling commands that we had to follow" are the types of recollections men have. Talk is very important in Anganen. Men whose talk is weak and easily ignored are "rubbish men", while those who do not regard themselves as such react with great affront if they are not given the chance to speak in public meetings. Thus, colonial labour organization in road crews or on plantations effectively renders the Anganen men who engage in it as "rubbish men". Botol has the same effect but through different means: the material rubbish of this new political economy invades their bodies. Just as consumption constitutes the person so, too, does this mysterious intrusion. While I do not wish to project a simple determinist causality, the logic correlates with the observation that no death has yet been attributed to botol. With rom and niambu, it is big men or aspiring big men that are most likely to die. Lesser men (and others) may die through these methods but they appear more likely to suffer affliction but not death. The the Anganen do not deny the possibility that botol may be fatal but as yet, no man has died; this logic does appear to reflect this point on power. Compared to Hageners or those on the nambis, Anganen men are like common men vis a vis big men. Implicitly, this comparison elides the hierarchy that Anganen men strive to have among themselves. In Anganen, Botol is an instance common in anthropological histories where a pre existing cultural dispositions find new expression in the (post-)colonial world. Sorcery persists because of this engagement, leaving a rich bricolage of old and new through the 114</page><page sequence="13">articulation of the local and the wider political economy. Two major pre-existing orientations to the world guide the formation of Anganen consciousness in the contem porary setting; namely, how the experience of pain, the stories or speculations of others, and their own imaginations render botol real. One orientation is the conviction that the mystical causes misfortune and this concept is bound up in the exercise of power, be it political or increasingly economic, as is the case with botol. The second orientation is the con textualization of relationships of morality with sorcery and power. It is not that any form of sorcery is intrinsically bad, as it is the situations within which rom or niambu are practiced that determines them as valid or not. Botol is evil precisely because the Anganen are denied the capacity to make such moral decisions. It is an improper inequivalence which reflects the broader inequities the Anganen believe "development" has generated. Equally, botol is about accommodation, that is, the adoption and adaptation of both power structures and the significance of material and cultural dimensions of the encompassing hegemonic order (eg., see Comaroff and Comaroff 1991a; Keesing 1992). Ultimately, botol is about the Anganen place within this order and a stark reminder that their ambition to become more prominent remain unfulfilled. Like so many of once, relatively autonomous tribal peoples in colonial and post-colonial settings, the body is the focus of history and a key site through which it is experienced (eg., see Clark 1989, 2000; Comaroff 1985). However, if the mind-body dichotomy is negated in the construction of self (eg., see Csordas 1990) there are a multiplicity of sources that render botol not only real but a dominant instance of contemporary social life. Jackson (1994:223) has a valid criticism of the radical separation between what is termed emotional and physical pain by privileging the latter as somehow more important. Few Anganen have experienced the pain of botol personally but the trepidation of town and its strangers, the obvious (to the Anganen) material differences between urban and rural lifestyles, even the pity experienced when a relative does suffer this affliction, render botol a self-evident and forever dangerous reality. The pain of botol and its cure link the meta-commentary on a modernity to the lived experience of Anganen people. This conjuncture is not a reification of culture in that it has the power to see the truth of this modernity, irrespective of its carriers. The Anganen, the men especially, confront the materiality of this world and know through experience, that broken glass or bits of metal may infiltrate bodies and cause pain. But they do not know how this is done or who exactly is doing it and this lack of knowledge is the critical force of botol. Thus, botol as a meta-commentary, just as sorcery has always been vis a vis morality and power, actively engages in constituting the reality of the world. Indeed, given that its cure and perhaps also its cause are ritual, the material items of botol operate very much like ritual symbols. "Rubbish" renders individuals likewise; the kupa blood redness of the twenty kina note is the conveyer of health. These items and others such as the pollutants and dimensions of the cure, pertain to what Victor Turner (1967, 1968, 1970, 1974) terms the poles of meaning in ritual symbolism; these poles of meaning lie at the core of ritual's potency and transformative potential. Turner makes use of various expressions of the two polarities (the oretic, sensory or biological pole and the political, ideological or normative pole). The term used is not as significant as Turner's claim that these poles are capable of integrating the broader social universe in which people live with 115</page><page sequence="14">the individual s expenences of her or his bio-psychological being. Thus, botol sorcery is one medium through which the power or the new pohtical economy and Anganen marginality to it, becomes a lived reality. It is the lack of precise knowledge and symbolic capacity of the material objects and their manipulation that generates an Anganen sense of the present and their part in it. When botol is considered in ritual terms it strongly supports the Comaroffs' (1991b) claim that ritual must be central to historical anthropology: "The creative power of ritual .... arises from the fact that .... its constituent signs are ever open to the accumulation of new associations and referents. These, to be sure, are the things that make it always so responsive to history" (Comaroff and Comaroff 1991b:xxi). Conclusion Botol is a metaphor of and experiential location for the Anganen expenence of the contemporary world. This ritual sorcery encodes power and Anganen marginality and it influences the Anganen consciousness of themselves, of others and of the world in which they live. In order to consider this sorcery form and its impact, it has been necessary to explore a number of themes that intersect in underwriting the importance of botol sorcery. The historical past as well as the present day are both critical influences in botol belief. It is the memories of powerful Kewa sorcerers and trade in rom and niambu sorcery forms that help frame the self-evidence of botol, in spite of the fact that no Anganen is skilled in the practice of this sorcery. In part, this process relies upon notions of similarity, in how they imagine botol might work but mostly, its efficacy stems from its difference to other sorcery forms. This difference is a key aspect of its mystery and a crucial factor leading to the Anganen's incapacity to make use of botol as their own practice to help overcome their marginality. Co-existing with this logic is the persisting consciousness of Anganen disempowerment of their early colonial history, and colonialism's legacy of new places of power, new material items, and new personnel such as Whites, politicians, botol pia, even prostitutes; these factors create a human existence to issues of power and agency. All generate a sense of a potential and much desired empowerment but they also generate the reality of Anganen marginality. In certain respects, that a botol pia may be both sorcerer and healer, epitomises these new forms of power and the disadvantage (post-)colony has for the Anganen. That money causes pain and may cure — its capacity to purity and to pollute — sums up the contradiction the Anganen endure between desire and achievement in their marginalised situation. The Anganen bring to their understudying of botol a myriad of cultural dispo sitions that both frame and are framed by the reality of this new order. The most important of these dispositions are the personification of power and evil, together with the dominance of "heavy things" by items from capitalist production. Through consumption or ritual, this materiality of the contemporary world constitutes the self, in botol as rubbish. The issue of pain, framed in a psychological orientation of mystery and trepidation also contributes to this process that constitutes, in essence, a vivid metaphor of and an experiential location for, the Anganen subjectivity of this marginality. Botol is Anganen pathos in a Melanesian 116</page><page sequence="15">modernity, it is about pain and "progress", but a progress far more for others than the Anganen themselves. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The ethnography in this paper comes from twenty five months fieldwork generously supported by the University of Adelaide. My gratitude goes to the referees and the editor of Social Analysis for their assistance. 1. Of course, this situation may not last, as knowledgeable men may seek economic gain by selling botol to Anganen. Nonetheless, I cannot simply agree with Zelenietz's (1981:11) statement that "With sorcery knowledge available to all and sundry, sorcery has become a means by which the envious and the jealous may strike out at successful others." He is referring to the increase in "endo-sorcery", to use Lindenbaum's (1981:119) term, which is the situation prevailing in Mendi. Zelenietz is not arguing that each individual per se will have equal access, only that new forms will spread rapidly, as colonialism causes individuals from different regions to interact. However, this is an historical process all its own. At least, for the time period of my discussion, this has yet to occur with botol in Anganen. 2. Stephen (1987:267) notes that, while often overlooked in more recent literature, it is common throughout Melanesia to find this dual role of both healer and harmer as a double edged avenue to power. The sorcerer here, however, is known, being in some way part of the immediate social world that his victims and patients inhabit. The botol sorcerer is not known to the Anganen. The Anganen situation does seem uncommon. Even when the directionality of sorcery changes due to altered power relations, for example, as Knauft (1998) details for the Gebusi, sorcerer and victim are, more or less, still part of one geo-social domain. 3. "Mendi" is largely a colonial product. Certainly the Anganen knew of this valley before the arrival of the Australians and probably had some sense of an ethnic identity for those who resided there. (Mendi means "another" in Anganen language indicating that, despite recog nition of linguistic and cultural affinities, the Anganen were disposed to recognizing identity more in terms of difference than similarity.) However, the Anganen were far more prone to identifying smaller social groupings, such as the villages of the lower Mendi, with whom they have had long relations. 4. Richard Eves (2000) argues that contemporary sorcery among the Lelet is more about morality than inequality. For instance: "[sorcery] is not a meta commentary on inequality as such but refers more exactly to a failure of the morality and management of exchange in the new context of modernity" Eves (2000:466). In Anganen, botol is about both inequality and morality, as part of the Anganen sense of marginality stems from the denied access to botol and this is a moral issue in its own right. 5. There is no reason why women cannot be victims but because they visit places like Mt. Hagen only occasionally, they are less vulnerable. However, botol has repercussions for women even if they are not attacked, namely the sadness they feel when men close to them like sons, brothers or husbands are afflicted. 6. See Clark (1989) for his forceful argument on this point for the Wiru, and Nihill (1994, 1999) for detailed discussion of the Anganen situation. 7. Uncertainty also extends to deciding whether botol or some other means is responsible 117</page><page sequence="16">for an affliction. Botol mostly causes intense, localized pain but this is not exclusive to this form of sorcery alone. The failure of pulu divination may be a factor but the Anganen do not regard this as completely reliable when detecting sorcerers using other forms. It is considered significant if a man has visited town recently or angered a coffee buyer. 8. Opa is the pidgin term the Anganen use for animal sacrifice to the spirits, thereby highlighting great continuity between this ancestral ritual and church services. Although they do not deliberately sacrifice animals for the ancestors any more, it is felt that church services and the spirits consuming the smell and smoke of cooked animals at major feasts still have influence. 9. I only gained access to the Akin and Robbins edited collection on money in Melanesia in the final stages of preparing this paper and cannot take up many of the interesting issues it raises. However, my argument fully supports Li Puma's(1999:194) statement that "I argue that money is the perfect instrument of modernization not because — as formal economics would have us think — it has form without content, but because its defined and often definite content is so contextually specific and dependent". 10. Coins are sometimes used in exchanges but to empathically signal political messages. For example, in 1980 an old Aramuri man died while the then tribal fighting in the Lai-Nembi region was raging. One of his sons threw a number of one kina coins at his father's maternal kin who had come to mourn the man's death. The young man called it ambula kala, the term for mortuary compensation that rightly should go to these men. He left without further explanation but all agreed that it was to signal his disgust over the possibility that close allies of his father's maternal kin may have been the cause of the old man's death. While this man's maternal kin were not actively involved, their allies were assisting the Aramuri enemies and may have killed the old man with sorcery as part of the hostilities. 11. Kend is also a term for pregnancy and pearl shells are graded in terms of their thickness and extension. This is one of a number of anthropomorphic characteristics that symbolically render shells highly suited to exchanges with human beings, such as with bride wealth. Their red colour, kupa, the same term for the colour of the K20 note, also means "blood". As the main text considers, this is key to the appropriateness of the K20 in the cure of botol. Colour thus links wealth to persons as the focus of exchange and ritual. 12. The Mendi do not use the K20 to facilitate a cure but continue to use leaves in ritual processes. Within Anganen terms, there is a strong resemblance between K20 and leaves, as notes are termed "leaves" in opposition to "stone" coins. As such, the K20 not only get its significance from the wider political economy but also through its resonance with previous ritual procedure in Anganen. 13. This house had fallen into disuse following the mysterious death of its main operator. However, many Anganen feel it will be reactivated at some time. Akin, A. and J.
