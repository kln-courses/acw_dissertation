<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> “It Proceeded from the Entrance   of a Demon into the Man”1 Epileptic Seizures in Ancient Medical Texts   and the New Testament Annette Weissenrieder And as he is who falls and knows not how, By force of demons who to earth down drag him, Or other oppilation that binds man, When he arises and around him looks, Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish (Dante Alighieri) Abstract: This paper aims to show how epilepsy was investigated in “rational” medical  and theological discourses in antiquity: cognitive and somatic manifestations of epilepsy  are intertwined and an epileptic attack is interpreted as a complete loss of consciousness  in these sources. In Mark 9:14 – 29 and Luke 9:37 – 43, the Synoptic Gospels narrate Jesus’  healing of an epileptic boy which describe the attack using the standard term from ancient  medicine. This view is further reinforced by Matthew’s version of the story where the sick- ness of the boy is described with the verb seleniazomai, “to be moonstruck” (17:15). It is  in fact remarkable that the Gospels, but especially Luke, interpret “epilepsy” linguistically  in the context of ancient medicine, still mention a demon. The texts distinguish between  the sick person and the disease that invades the patient as an independent force from the  outside. If a religious community assumes that it can explain the patient’s etiology and thus  any deviations from the healthy state through religion, and if it therefore ascribes illnesses  to unclean spirits or demons and describes overcoming as a process of conquering these  forces, that does not make the system any less medical. This insight is particularly apt  when the physical symptoms are expressly understood in a medical sense, but the etiology  is described demonologically. Introduction In the Inferno, Dante Alighieri makes a connection between “the falling evil,”  that is, the “force of demons” in a human being, and a medical interpretation,  namely “congesting” or blocking the ventricles of the brain, which is signified  1 Aretaeus SC 1.4; for further informations see pp. 274 – 75. </page> <page sequence="2"> 266 Annette Weissenrieder by the Latin term oppilatio, a well-known term in medieval medicine. This term  oppilatio is often used by medieval physicians describing epileptic phenomena  (“falls and knows not how,” “oppilation”). At the same time, Dante is referring  to a demonological explanation of a human being suffering from the falling sick- ness (“force of demons”) as well as to a medical phenomenon in a person’s brain.  The oldest source referring both to the demonological (-magical) explanation  and to medical knowledge comes from first-century C. E. physician Aretaeus of  Cappadocia, who refers to epilepsy as the result of demonic possession, or the  punishment of the goddess of the moon.2 The context in which this explanation  is found, however, also reflects medical knowledge: the brain as the cause of epi- leptic seizures. Aretaeus’ interpretation may have influenced Greek and Latin  Church fathers.3 Origen of Alexandria († 254) writes: Physicians may offer natural theories since according to their view it is not an unclean  spirit but a bodily affection and physiology which presents itself in bodily humors  in the head which move according to the movement of the moon which has a humid  structure as well. We, however, also believe the euaggelion in the point that this disease  [the lunacy] in those affected with it, is obviously brought about by an unclean and  dumb spirit. (Origen, In Matth. Comment. 13.3 – 6) Origen refers to the illness construct of “epilepsy,” which he assumes physi- cians (iatroi) refer to as a “bodily affection” (sōmatikon sumptōma) caused by  “humors in the head” (ta hugra . . . ta en tē kefalē) and that he – reminiscent of  Galen – associates with the course of the moon.4 Both the “humors in the head”  and “the course of the moon” are grammatically paralleled with Origen’s own  theological perspective, “the unclean and dumb spirit.” Therefore it is clear that  Origen largely knows about the physicians’ medical understanding. However, is  also indisputable that he rejects these. Similar ideas are also expressed in a satir- ical dialogue by Lucian, who writes, “[e]veryone knows about the Syrian from  Palestine, the adept in it, how many he takes in hand who fall down in the light  of the moon and roll their eyes and fill their mouths with foam; nevertheless, he  restores them to health and sends them away normal in mind, delivering them  from their straits for a large fee” (Lucian Philopseudes 16, LCL 1921, 344 – 345).  All four of these sources have one thing in common: They seem to be aware of  the etiological cause of an epileptic phenomenon in the head and brain, while  they connect its consequences to a form of demonic obsession that is expressed  physically. Therefore, the sources allow the supposition that the brain is inter- preted as “a relational organ” (Fuchs 2011, 347 – 358), which is embodied by dif- ferent interpretations. 2 Aretaeus SC 1.4. Temkin (1994, 40) defines demonic possession as “the intrusion of a god,  demon or ghost of a hitherto normal individual who now behaves like a willing or reluctant  instrument of the intrudent.” 3 See Aretaeus SC 1.4. 4 Cf. Galen De diebus decretoriis 3.2 (9.902 f. Kühn); De locis affectis 3.9 (8.175 – 177; 233  Kühn). </page> <page sequence="3"> “It Proceeded from the Entrance of a Demon into the Man” 267 In this paper, I aim to show how epilepsy was investigated in “rational” med- ical and theological discourses in antiquity. In the following, I will describe the  terms, some grammatical issues, theoretical foundations, and explanatory strate- gies of the medical and theological discourses of epileptic phenomena more pre- cisely. In addition to the Greek text of the New Testament, I will also make use  of the Old Latin version of the New Testament, the Vetus Latina, though briefly,  in order to evaluate the reception of medicine in theological discourse. For one  thing is worth noting: cognitive and somatic manifestations of epilepsy are inter- twined in these sources. 1. Phlegm, pneuma, Blood and Bile and the Question   of the Cause of Epilepsy “Rational medicine” is widespread, above all, in the Corpus Hippocraticum  (abbreviated thereafter CH) and in later works by medical theorists such as  Herophilus and Galen (cf. Tieleman 1996), who brought physical and scientific  legality to the fore (cf. Weissenrieder 2003; Weissenrieder and Etzelmüller 2007).  “Rational” is understood here as logikos in the sense of theoretically substanti- ated, indicating a closeness to the natural philosophy of antiquity. The beginning  of rational medicine refers therefore most clearly “in the discovery of disease as  a natural process: a particular type of cause produces as a rule a particular type  of effect” (see Tieleman 2010, 83 – 95, here 90; 2013, 101 – 115). Many texts of the  Hippocratic Corpus the treatise refer to epileptic phenomena (cf. Weissenrieder  2003, chap. 7):5 The adjective epileptos means that a person suffers from an attack  of a disease and the adjective epileptikos refers to any kind of attack.6 Within the  Hippocratic Corpus De morbo sacro and De flatibus take similar positions, in  so far as both texts offer an etiological interpretation of the illness of epilepsy;  however, they take different paths in their theoretical foundation, especially with  regard to the question of the seat of cognition. Both texts agree in the fact that  they accept a “consciousness-bearing” substance which spreads in the body. And  both texts see a connection between the cognitive abilities and physical reac- tions and a blockage of these “consciousness-bearing” substances in the body.  Whereas De morbo sacro regards pneuma as the reason of epilepsy, De flatibus  refers to the blood. We come first to De morbo sacro: The setting of the fourth chapter is the portrayal of the “epileptic phenom- ena.”7 5 See e. g. CH Coac. 157, 339, 445, 450, 511, 587; Epid. 7.1; Aphor. 2.45; 3.16, 20; Prorr. 1.131;  Mul. 2.151. 6 Temkin writes: “The distinction between systematic epilepsy, i. e., a syndrome which  might be associated with various diseases, and the possible existence of an ‘essential’ or ‘genu- ine’ disease, epilepsy, is of relatively modern origin and was of little importance in antiquity”  (Temkin 1994, 28; cf. Weissenrieder 2003, chap. 7; Wohlers 1997). 7 If not mentioned otherwise, the translations are mine. </page> <page sequence="4"> 268 Annette Weissenrieder We also take in the majority of spirit (pneuma) along these vessels, for they are vents  for our body. By drawing in air (aēr), they conduct it into the rest of the body along  the smaller vessels and they refresh the spirit (pneuma) in the rest of the body and once  again they discharge the air. For the spirit is not able to stand still but moves up and  down. Should it stand still somewhere and be cut off, that part where the spirit stands  still becomes powerless. [CH De morbo sacro 4.1 – 9 (VI 368.1 – 9 Littré)] The fourth chapter is thus to be classified in an etiological sense. Here the author  describes the function of the veins in breathing. The chapter provides the basis  for his further discussion of air and its role in the formation of consciousness.  The theory developed here forms the basis for numerous Hippocratic treatises  (cf. De aere aquis locis 10).8 The ancient medical texts do not provide informa- tion as to how deeply the pneuma infiltrates the body. We read in the Hippo- cratic treatise De victu 2.38: “As there is breath in living things, it is also present  in all the remainders.”9 It is the whole body that inhales and exhales. After the  spirit (pneuma) finds its way to the brain, it takes effect in the stomach, the lungs  and the “veins”. It is significant that the text shifts between outside air, aēr, and  inside air, breath / spirit (pneuma). The movement of the pneuma in the body is  also further specified in chapter 7 by the verb xūmballetai, which has a funda- mental meaning of “bringing together” or “uniting” (LSJ 1996). It is the interior  pneuma that, according to the treatise, links the various body parts. Notable is  the verb reviving / refreshing, anapsūchousi, which lacks a clearly stated object.  Hence, it is preferable to understand the object of the verb as pneuma, which is  as breath / spirit the air inside the body.10 The consciousness-bearing substance is  thus the breath, pneuma, in contrast to De flatibus, where blood is considered the  central substance. This pneuma must always remain in motion. Otherwise the  body part in which the pneuma pauses will become powerless. The seventh chapter provides the heart of the work De morbo sacro. In  essence, the author explains in chapter 7 that the majority of pneuma is inhaled  by the respiratory system and the veins “by dragging the air into the body and  carrying it to the bodily members” (van der Eijk 2005, 131). An “epileptic” sei- zure is portrayed as the result of phlegm flowing into the air passages, rendering  the blood vessels unable to distribute the vital pneuma. This accumulation is  based on the prenatal or postnatal katharsis of phlegm in the brain. The illness  is caused by a blockage of passages that, spreading out from the brain to the  rest of the body, is responsible for transporting pneuma. The pneuma can be  understood here as a “consciousness-bearing” material (van der Eijk 2005, 131 ff.;  see Temkin 1936, 141 – 44, Temkin 1994). This accumulation results in different   8 One finds examples of other systems in CH De carnibus 5, according to which all veins  come from the heart.  9 Galen refers several times to this aphorism; see De sanitate tuenda I 10.22 f. (CMG V 4.2)  and III 4.7 (179.10); De opt.const. 4 (IV 746 Kühn); see also Gal De sanitate tuenda CMG V 10  2.2 126 ff. 10 This view would then be similar to that of Philistion and Diocles of Carystus and the  single purpose of breathing attributed to Hippocrates by Galen (De Usu Respirationis 1.2 – 3;  VII 769 K). For air in De morbo sacro see Hippocrate 2003, 255 – 258; see also Debru 1996, 180 ff. </page> <page sequence="5"> “It Proceeded from the Entrance of a Demon into the Man” 269 symptoms, depending on the part of the body in question: close to heart it leads  to palpitation and asthma, in the abdomen it leads to diarrhea, and in the vessels  it leads to a spasm of the hands, crossed eyes, foaming at the mouth, symptoms  of choking or suffocation. With this enumeration, the author takes up the symp- toms already mentioned in chapter one, but explains them here scientifically,  adding aphonia to the list. In contrast to the magician’s understanding of this  illness, mentioned in chapter 1 of this treatise, the mental affection is of primary  importance for the physician. The mental phenomena of illness are here associ- ated with the brain. It is noteworthy that the author grants the heart a reaction  to the bodily processes. If the phlegm should be shut off from these passages but make its descent into the  channels that I have mentioned, the patient becomes speechless and chokes and froth  flows out of the patient’s mouth. His teeth are clenched and his hands are drawn up.  His eyes are distorted and perceive nothing. . . . A patient becomes speechless when- ever the phlegm shuts off the air because it has come down into the channels, and the  patient receives air neither in his brain nor in his hollow channels nor in his ventricles  but he stops breathing. Whenever a human receives breath through the mouth or nos- trils, it goes first to the brain. The greatest part of it, however, goes into the internal  cavity, some of it to the lung but some of it to the channels. From these body parts, it  is dispersed to the remaining parts along the channels. As much breath as enters into  the internal cavity cools the internal cavity and nothing flows to another part. The air  in the lung and the channels, however, flows together into the ventricles as it enters  also into the brain. Thus, the air furnishes intelligence and movement to the bodily  members. Whenever therefore the channels of the air are clogged by the phlegm and  do not receive the air, the result is that they render the human speechless and senseless.  The hands become powerless and drawn after the blood becomes calm and not dis- persed as usual. The eyes are distorted as the small channels are shut off from the air  and they throb. The foam from the mouth is furnished from the lung, for whenever  the breath does not enter it, it foams and sputters as though dying. . . . This symptom  occurs whenever the breath does not enter the mouth as usual. The patient kicks with  his feet whenever the air is shut up in the members since it cannot pass through to the  outside because of the phlegm. As the air rushes upward and downward through the  blood, it engenders spasm and pain. Therefore, the patient kicks. The patient suffers all  these symptoms whenever the cold phlegm flows in the blood while it is warm, for it  chills the blood and makes it stand still. If the flow of phlegm should be copious and  thick, it kills the patient straightaway, for it masters the blood by its cold and congeals  it. [CH De morbo sacro 7.1 – 39 (VI 372.4 – 374.13 Littré)] The author is specifically interested in demonstrating that the brain is the cause  of attacks of the “sacred disease” (cf. Jouanna 2003, 93 ff.; Grensemann 1968,  200 ff.). In chapter 16, this author addresses a wide-ranging discussion in the  ancient world about the bodily organ responsible for thinking and intelligence.  The earliest position seems to be that the diaphragm is the seat of intelligence.  Authors such as Diogenes of Apollonia (VS 64 A 20) and the Hippocratic author  of De carnibus argue very forcefully that the heart is the central organ of reason,  decision-making, and intelligence, and this view was widespread in the ancient  world. Against this popular position, the author of De morbo sacro weighs in on  the side of those who assert the brain to be the intellectual center of the human  </page> <page sequence="6"> 270 Annette Weissenrieder body. Notable in chapter 7 is the verb “perceiving, have understanding” – phro- neousin (see line 13 underlined), which does not have a clear subject: the subject  could be either patients or eyes (accusativus limitationes). In order to decide one  way or the other, it is significant to note that the other references to the patient in  the treatise all use singular verbs. The plural verb form thus indicates the changes  in the eyes during a serious attack. In consequence, the eyes and not the patient  are the subject of perceiving and understanding. Finally, chapter 16 represents the theoretical explanation of the attacks of the  “sacred disease” described in chapters 13 – 15. Chapter 14 describes attacks of  this disease that occur most often at night, while chapter 15 is devoted to those  attacks that occur during the day. The nocturnal attacks are caused by bile and  lead to shrieking and destructive behaviors directed both inward and outward,  and the body is “like a corpse” (see also Mark 9:26). The attacks during the day  are caused by phlegm and cause an altered consciousness and convulsions. These  various diurnal and nocturnal symptoms arise from a single source, namely the  brain. The brain is the chief organ of the body in general. Nevertheless, it is air  that enables intelligence, comprehension, and discernment. Sense organs, speech,  and motor skills are mediated through the commands of the brain. The com- mands are communicated through the air to the individual organs. These organs  also have the ability of discernment. The air arrives first in the brain, making  the brain the comprehensive center of intelligence and discernment. Now the  brain perceives not only the consciousness or intelligence (phronēsis) from the  air but also climatic changes that alter the air, and the “sacred disease” is there- fore affected by these environmental factors. The brain is described as interpret- ing (hermeneus) what came from the air outside. With this thought, the author  returns to ideas expressed at the beginning of his treatise. The author differentiates the diaphragm and the heart from the brain. Both  the heart and the diaphragm certainly have aisthēsis in the sense of reflex and  sensation, but not phronēsis (consciousness; intelligence) in the sense of mental  abilities. The brain already plays an important role in the explanation of epilepsy,  which he describes in chapter 11 [see CH De morbo sacro 11.3 – 5 (VI 382 Littré)]  as an illness caused by an accumulation of phlegm in and around the brain. He  employs an empirical argument: If one opened the skull of a goat that died of an  epileptic fit, one would find a large amount of phlegm around the brain. For this reason I believe that the brain possesses the greatest power in the human being,  for it is the interpreter (hermeneus) for us of the phenomena of what comes to the body  through the air if it is healthy. Further, the air supplies the intelligence (phronēsis) and  the eyes, the ears, the tongue, the hands, and the feet carry out such things as much as  the brain knows, for the phenomenon of intelligence is produced in the entire body so  long as the body partakes of air. But the brain is the interpreter for comprehension. For  when a human draws in breath (pneuma), it arrives first in the brain, and thus the air  is distributed into the remaining body after it has deposited its greatest strength in the  brain, namely, the thing that has both consciousness and understanding (phronēsis and  gnomē). For if the air were to arrive in the body first and afterwards in the brain, the  power of discernment (diagnōsis) would be left in the fleshly parts and in the vessels,  it would come into the brain while it is warm and not pure but mixed with the moist  </page> <page sequence="7"> “It Proceeded from the Entrance of a Demon into the Man” 271 secretions both from the fleshly parts and the blood so as to be no longer accurate.  Therefore, I say that the brain is the interpreter of comprehension (sūnesis). . . . Some  say that we owe our consciousness to the heart and that this is the member which  grieves and feels anxiety. This is not so; rather it is torn just like the diaphragm and even  more than that, for the same causes, for blood vessels stretch into it [the heart] from all  over the body, and the heart has been connected so as to perceive if any pain or strain  occurs in the human being. Now, it is necessary for the body to shudder and strain for  the extent of time that a human experiences distress and to contract when it feels pain,  and when it is overwhelmed by joy it experiences the same. Therefore, in the heart as  well as the diaphragm, feeling is the most acute. Certainly, in neither of the two share  in consciousness at all, but of all these things, the brain perceives the intelligence of the  air before the other members that are in the body. Thus, also the brain first perceives  if any more violent change occurs in the air by the seasons of the year and if the air  itself becomes at variance with itself. Therefore also, I say that the most acute and most  severe and deadliest illnesses as well as the illnesses hardest to discern by the inexpe- rienced fall within the province of the brain. [Corpus Hippocraticum De morbo sacro  16.1 – 17.26 (VI 390.10 – 394.8 Littré)] The author attempts to describe the abilities of the brain by using various terms  such as phronēsis (consciousness, intelligence), phronimos (consciousness), sūne- sis (comprehension, understanding), diagnōsis (discerning, thinking), and gnomē  (understanding). It is clear that phronēsis is presented as the most comprehensive  of these mental abilities. In English, phronēsis is rendered as intelligence of think- ing. According to Hüffmeier and Miller, it should be understood more as “having  one’s senses together” (Hüffmeier 1961, 58; cf. Miller 1948). The term implies  perception and movement, but it also refers to a force by which a living being  can deal with its surroundings. It is also remarkable that phronēsis can be found  throughout the body (through pneuma). Or to say it differently: Pneuma oper- ates in the body, but sūnesis (understanding) is restricted to the brain (see van der  Eijk 2005, 127). The brain is not only a source of understanding, but also of feel- ing, although the heart and the diaphragm take part in that as well. All the other  terms are dependent on and derivative of phronēsis. Sūnesis is rendered as compre- hension which is mediated to all other organs through the brain. Comprehension  is linked to sense and understanding, which according De morbo sacro is trans- mitted to all organs. Sense, discernment, and understanding are all distinguished  as brain activities and are also broadly provided to the other organs by the air,  though not to the degree that the air enables the brain to perform these functions. In antiquity, the work De flatibus, part of the Corpus Hippocraticum, was  already recognized as one of the writings11 that represent the doctrine of the  “Hypothetics,” whose basic premise is that sicknesses have a single cause (see  CH Flat., ed. Heiberg; CMG I, 1, 91 – 101; Ducatillon 1983, Jouanna 2003, Segal  1970). The author of De flatibus does not himself use the term hypothesis, but  11 The treatise De flatibus has an epideictic character, and we can suppose that it was con- ceived as a lecture for an audience. I refer primarily to (Krug 1993, 43 ff.; Langholf 1989). This  treatise shows that the Hippocratics not only had to distinguish themselves from magicians and  Templar healers, but also had to establish themselves in opposition to intellectual healers who  offered healing informed by their philosophy. </page> <page sequence="8"> 272 Annette Weissenrieder in essence he treats a principle source, pneuma, as a hypothesis. He understands  pneuma as the ruler (dūnastēs) that fills the universe and displays its power in the  human body.12 I propose that none of the contributory causes in the body is more for intelligence than  blood. Whenever blood remains in its usual state, intelligence also remains. When the  blood is altered, intelligence also undergoes a change. There are many examples testify- ing that this is so. First sleep, which is common to all animals, testifies to what was just  said. When sleep comes upon the body, the blood is cooled, for sleep produces a chill- ing by its nature. The passages become more sluggish by the blood’s being chilled. Now  this chilling is clear because bodies fall and become heavy, for all heavy things produce  a falling downward. The eyes close, and intelligence is altered, and some other visions  that are called dreams spend time there. Second, when the blood suddenly increases  by drunkenness, souls and the thoughts in souls undergo a change. Souls become for- getful of present evils and hopeful of future goods. I could state many such instances  in which changes of blood change the intelligence. If therefore all the blood should be  completely disordered, the intelligence must be utterly destroyed, for the things learnt  and recognized are habits. [CH De flatibus 14.1 – 15.8 (VI 110.14 – 114.20 Littré)] Thus it is clear that this author is not merely talking about the possible effects of  an epileptic attack, but also says that all physiological and sensory / motor skills  are lost. In other words, an epileptic attack is interpreted as a complete loss of  consciousness. The medical authors do not tend to hold theoretical discussions  about the seat of reason, as we would expect from Plato or Aristotle. However,  ancient writers are continually confronted with the theoretical issue when they  are faced with illnesses involving epileptic phenomena, mania, melancholy and  strokes. The Hippocratic author grants breath / air a central role in the life of  an organism, and air also plays an important role in causing illness. In addi- tion to causes outside the body, nourishment and digestion are also important  since food always contains air. Thus, air itself is now seen as a potential block- age or hindrance, while in the text De morbo sacro it was more likely to be hin- dered in its flow throughout the body: the blood13 is cooled by the air, making it  flow more slowly and providing the body with a reduced supply of conscious- ness. However, the author of the text also understands this to mean that any  change in the blood changes the intelligence, phronēsis; in other words, as long  as the blood is moving normally though the body, intelligence remains constant.  This movement is said to stop during sleep, when the blood cools and slows  down. In his treatise De somno et vigilia, Aristotle thus builds on De flatibus in a  certain sense, since both suspect that there is a connection between sleep and epi- 12 Although the author’s primary interest continues to be focused on pneuma, he mentions  individual phenomena under the catchword nourishment, trophē . In the text, he characterizes  pneuma as a genre for which two species are basic, which in turn are differentiated according to  their topos: breath is pneuma in the body and air is pneuma outside of bodies phūsē (Ionic for  Attic phūsa) refers to a pair of bellows, and the analogy to the chest cavity of animals is appro- priate. The dynamic movement produced by blasts of air from a bellows is also analogous to the  “blasts of air” in bodies that produce movement, as the rest of the text demonstrates. 13 Van der Eijk (2005, 132) analyzes the text as a “haematocentric approach to epilepsy.” </page> <page sequence="9"> “It Proceeded from the Entrance of a Demon into the Man” 273 lepsy, though with one difference: blood, which was still central to the argument  in De flatibus, now fades into the background as a cause. Sleep arises from evaporation due to food [. . .] Young children sleep deeply because all  the food is borne upwards. An indication of this is that in early youth the upper parts  of the body are larger in comparison with the lower parts which is due to the fact that  growth takes place in the upward direction. Hence too they are liable to epilepsy; for  sleep is like epilepsy; indeed sleep is a type of epileptic fit. This is why in many people  epilepsy begins in sleep [. . .]. (Aristotle, De somno et vigilia 3.457a4 ff.)14 Aristotle thus interprets epilepsy as a form of sleep without ascribing a patholog- ical significance to it. Sleep, he says, results from the process of digesting food,  which is heated by the warmth of sleep and not only reaches the brain in the  form of pneuma-breath, a warm steam, but also makes the head heavier, which  makes the person sleepy. As in De morbo sacro, he says that children are more  susceptible to this phenomenon. One final text is ascribed to Diocles and his pupil Praxagoras, which is handed  down to us through Anonymous Parisinus. As is his custom, Anonymous deals  with the positions of Praxagoras, Diocles of Carystus, and Hippocrates. The  reference to Praxagoras in this fragment is uncertain. In his well-known 1895  study, “Anecdota medica Graeca,” R. Fuchs already pointed out that the descrip- tion is more like Erasistratos’ etiology of illness preserved in Codex Paris. 636,  folio 132r.15 The text begins by naming epilēpsias,16 which initially means simply an occa- sional seizure that, however, does not need to coincide with the symptoms of an  illness. Here the name can simply refer to any seizure.17 Praxagoras says that it [epilepsy] originates around the thick artery when phlegmatic  humours come to exist in it. He says that by forming bubbles, these humors shut off  the passageway of the psychic pneuma from the heart. Thus, this spirit agitates and  wrenches the body. He says that the affliction ceases when the bubbles settle down  again. Diocles himself also thinks that there is a stoppage around the same place. He  also agrees that the other things happen according to the same causes, but it is Praxago- ras who says these things happen. Diocles has neglected to state the nature of the cause  of the stoppage but says that patients recover with more difficulty at the termination  of the affliction if there are impediments to the spirit. Hippocrates states the cause of  the blockage to be moist phlegm. He said that all the brain is filled with moistures, and  the psychic spirit is shut off, but not everywhere, since the sinews through which the  bodily members were set in motion are filled by it. He said that the onset of an epileptic  seizure and the convulsion and the spasm occur by the charging of the spirit through  these sinews. He said that the affliction becomes acute either because of the degree of  14 The translation (van der Eijk 2005, 133) also refers to the connection between sleep and  physiological explanations like the ones found in Aristotle’s De somno et vigilia. 15 Cf. also Garofalo 1988: Erasistrati fragmenta, fr. 293. 16 See CH De morbo sacro; De aere, aquis, locis 3 (II 18 Littré); see (Temkin 1936, 137 ff.) 17 The basic texts for the illnesses described with the terms cited here are Corpus Hippocrat- icum De morbo sacro; De aere, aquis, locis 3 f.; De flatibus 14 and Arist.

[Anonymus Parisinus, De morbis acutis et chroniis 3 (18,10 – 20,6  Garofalo)] The basic view is that a psychic phenomenon comes from the heart and causes  convulsions in the body. The opposing view is offered by the author of the work  De morbo sacro (chap. 9 – 11), part of the Corpus Hippocraticum. The external  causes of the flow of phlegm are basically named here. The treatise interprets the  modalities of the course of an illness under changing bodily conditions on the  basis of which prognoses are formed, since children and the aged are in particular  danger because of their veins. To summarize this point: Ancient medical texts use the same terms – nosos,  nosēma and pathos – to describe illnesses located both in the body and in the  brain. So ancient definitions of epileptic phenomena are described as a “disor- der of the body” (CH Epid. VI 8.31.), an “interruption of the leading function”  of the body (Gal. De sympt.diff. 3, VII 58 – 59 Kühn), and in his Definitiones  medicae, Pseudo-Galen interprets the illness as a seizure of the thinking faculty  “when the evil is abating and past its height” (Ps.-Gal. DM 240, XIX 414 Kühn).  Therefore, these medical texts refuse to envisage a separation of body and mind,  as remarked by Putnam and Cellucci (see Putnam 1995, 3; Cellucci 2005, 390 ff.);  instead, the texts identify this illness as responsible for influencing a person’s  thinking, sensory and motor faculties, and behavior. It should also be noted that  none of these texts proposes a concept of “soul” or “mental activity.” At this  point, it should be clear that theories of embodiment and this article presented  here share an important insight (see Thompson 2010, Gallagher 2013, Fuchs  2013): “Mind, therefore, is not incidentally but intimately embodied and inti- mately embedded in its world” (Haugeland 1998, 237). Ancient interpretations  of epilepsy show that the brain (the heart and the blood) is not a neural network  that remain hidden in a supposed interior space, largely separate from the world;  instead, it is to be seen as a dynamic form of physical being-in-the-world. The  texts also show that sensory and motor skills should not be interpreted sepa- rately from “consciousness,” but as a way of defining what the mind is. 2. The Synoptic Gospels In Matt 17:14 – 21, Mark 9:14 – 29 and Luke 9:37 – 43, the Synoptic Gospels narrate  Jesus’ healing of an epileptic boy. The narratives portray the illness as an embodi- ment or “disembodiment”18 – as Loren Stuckenbruck calls it – of unclean spirits,  demons, and spirit / breath into or out of a human body. The terms used in Greek  are “to cast” (ekballein) out and departing (exerchomai). Both terms allude to  notions of action and movement of a demon which often leads to an evaluation  18 This term was first used in context of demonology by Stuckenbruck (2014, 174). </page> <page sequence="11"> “It Proceeded from the Entrance of a Demon into the Man” 275 of the terminology as “exorcistic rather than therapeutic” (Kelley 2011, 210). Do  the Synoptic Gospels therefore show an emphasis of terms referring to an exor- cism instead of a illness and healing? Of course, the previous observations raise doubts about this analysis. First of  all, it is noteworthy that Mark 9:14 – 29 as well as Luke 9:37 describe the attack  using the standard term from ancient medicine. Not only do medical texts as  well as Mark and Luke refer to a young child (paida in the Greek text; infans  and pueris in Latin) who suffered from epilepsy from “childhood” (ek paidio- then Mark 9:21),19 the medical texts also refer to the boy’s grinding his teeth  (Mark 9:18 NTG29; strindet dentibus Vetus Latina),20 foaming (Mark 9:18, 20  and Luke 9:39),21 and convulsing (Mark 9:20; Luke 9:39).22 Linguistically, these  descriptions are completely consistent with the manner of speaking found in  medical texts. The precise naming of the symptoms not only shows that the  authors must have been familiar with the symptoms of the illness; the list, which  is mentioned repeatedly by Mark in particular, also indicates that the text’s read- ers were able to classify the symptoms and assign them to an illness. This view  is further reinforced by Matthew’s version of the story. The tale of the boy with  a falling sickness is given its special narrative profile through a dual interpre- tation of the sickness of the boy, who falls into the fire and into the water; the  parallelism of the repetition emphasizes its frequency (pollakis, “often”). How- ever, the story is noteworthy because of the use of the verb selēniazomai, “to be  moonstruck” (17:15). In medical literature, this term is first used by Aretaeus of  Cappadocia, who also takes a commonly held view in the context of a medical  etiology, writing: But also it is reckoned a disgraceful form of disease; for it is supposed that it is an  infliction on persons who have sinned against the Moon (Selene): and hence some have  called it the Sacred Disease, and that for more reasons than one, as from the greatness  of the evil, for the Greek word hieros also signifies great; or because the cure of it is not  human, but divine; or from the opinion that it proceeded from the entrance of a demon  into the man: from one, or all these causes together, it has been called Sacred. [Aretaeus  SC I 4.2 (38.28 ff. Hude; translation: Adams 1856, 297)]. According to Aretaeus, Selene is said to punish crimes against the moon god- dess with “epileptic phemonena.” The type of crime can be better understood  through a brief notice by Callimachus (3rd century BCE), which he took from  the chronicler Chenomedes; the text mentions that the goddess Artemis had  afflicted Cydippe, a woman of Naxos, with quartan fever, then a bad cold and  finally epileptic attacks (see Call. Aet. 75,121 ff.). Artemis sends these attacks  because Cydippe had promised Artemis, against her will, to marry a man named  19 Cael. Aur. Morb. Chron. I 4,60: puerilis passio. 20 Cael. Aur. Morb.

In this sense, “epileptic phe- nomena” are beyond human intervention, but certainly are the result of human  guilt (Keydell 1969, 390). Aretaeus’ comments could thus indicate that the boy’s  falling sickness was caused by a divine power as a punishment. However, there  are several reasons that the text does not necessarily follow this interpretation:23  Galen is investigating the influence of the environment, the macrocosm, on the  human body.24 In this sense, the illness is caused by phlegma, which comes from  environmental influences that cannot be affected by people. This is also made  clear by a short passage in De morbo sacro: This disease, which is called sacred, arises from the same causes as the others, from the  things that come and go away and from cold and sun and winds that change and never  rest. These things are divine, so that one ought not to separate this disease and regard  it as being more divine than the others; it is rather that all are divine and all are human  (alla panta theia kai anthrōpina panta), and each of them has a nature and a power of  its own. [CH De morbo sacro 18.1 – 2 6.394 Littré (translation: van der Eijk 2005, 51)] One way of understanding this grammatical construction is that theios, the  divine, can be included as an attribute or prophasis along with the climatic fac- tors. Accordingly, it would be the climatic factors that are beyond human influ- ence. An illness is only divine if it is caused by factors that are beyond human  influence, such as heat or cold, the sun or the moon. If we follow Galen’s medi- cal interpretation, it is possible that the term selēniazomai, “to be moonstruck,”  (Matt 17:15) refers to the supposedly unchanging position of the moon. This  clearly cannot be influenced by human power, as the triple reference to the disci- ples’ inability makes clear in the Matthaean version of the Gospel (v. 16, 19, 20).  This is all the more serious because in Matt 10:1, 8, the disciples are charged with  healing the sick. Thus, an inability to provide healing indicates a lack of faith  (v. 19). In Matthew 21:22, the request is syntactically subordinate to the prayer,  which also creates a dependency at the content level. The past tense form, “which  you already received,” implies that the prayer has been heard. In the prayer, the  petitioner subordinates himself to the will of God (Matt 21:22) and asks that  God’s will be done through his request. Thus, the “correct” request is through  the mode of prayer, but the prayer itself shows the relationship to God. This  perspective is further emphasized when we include a redactional change to the  Matthaean version, interpreting Jesus’ question “When shall I be with you?” as  a reference to the Emmanuel Christology in the first chapter, God’s being with  you. Secondly, the Matthaean version emphasizes the boy’s physical suffering  (paschein) or feeling badly (kakōs echein; see the manuscripts C D W f1 f13 M lat  syr) in verse 15. In any case, the question of guilt is not mentioned. We can there- fore see that despite the variations in the terminology employed in the Synoptic  Gospels, in each case the boy’s condition can be identified as epilepsy; the terms  refer to the boy’s illness and suffering. 23 Gal.

In Hipp. Aphor. comment. 3.22 (XVII B 624 Kühn). </page> <page sequence="13"> “It Proceeded from the Entrance of a Demon into the Man” 277 Ancient medicine is familiar with two models of epilepsy as described above  (see Weissenrieder 2003, chap. 7). Both of these start from the assumption of  damage to the brain due to bodily fluids brought on by the congestion of breath  in the arteries. One form manifests itself in conspicuous seizures; the other results  in paralysis. Whereas both phenomena are mentioned together in the Gospel of  Mark (Mark 9) – an impossible scenario in the context of ancient medicine – the  author of the Gospel of Luke omits the symptoms describing paralysis in the  boy and limits himself to the depiction of a seizure brought on by phlegm, which  includes a fit of dramatic physical movement. It is in fact remarkable that Luke, who interprets epilepsy in the context of  ancient medicine, still mentions a demon (Luke 9:42). Any interpretation of this  text always has to take the ambiguity of the term pneuma into consideration: On  the one hand, the unclean spirit refers to a demonic interpretation of the illness,  epilepsy (also mentioned in De morbo sacro); on the other hand, pneuma also  refers to unclean pneuma inside the human body, which is the cause of the epi- lepsy. If one follows the interpretation of the unclean spirit as a demon, the ques- tion regarding the function of this demon arises (For further details on epilepsy  see Wohlers 1999; Temkin 1994; Weissenrieder, 2003). A hint is found in the story of the healing of Peter’s mother, who was ill  with a high fever (Luke 4:39). In addressing the fever, Jesus treats the fever as  a demon and thus as a responsive person. Luke distinguishes between the sick  person and the disease that invades the patient as an independent force from  the outside. A comparable situation can also be found in Mark 9:20, where the  pneuma recognizes Jesus and the boy then loses consciousness and experiences  an attack; or in Mark 9:25, where Jesus merely addresses the unclean spirit, not  the boy: “you mute and deaf spirit, I command you . . .” Precisely for this reason,  the patient is freed of the religious responsibility for his illness. This results in  the paradoxical situation that the introduction of a demon is to be interpreted  as antidemonic. Accordingly, the mention of the demon in Luke’s story of the  healing of the epileptic boy demonstrates that the cause of the disease is not to  be found in his alleged sins, but is to understand as being beyond human con- trol. Or, in a medical and sociological sense: if a religious community assumes  that it can explain the patient’s etiology and thus any deviations from the healthy  state through religion, if it ascribes illnesses to unclean spirits or demons and  describes overcoming them not as a physiological process, but as a process of  conquering these forces, that does not make the system any less medical. This  insight is particularly apt when the physical symptoms are expressly understood  in a medical sense, but the etiology is described demonologically. It is also worth  noting that in Greek manuscripts of Luke 9:42 (א, A, C, D, L) exaiphnēs belongs  to krazein: The boy cries out suddenly. In the Old Latin manuscript tradition  (D and e), however, exaiphnēs belongs to pneuma which reflects the medical  tradition: the pneuma seizes him suddenly. The demonological system of inter- pretation (the unclean, silent spirit) is thus seen as an expression of the med- ical understanding that the illness is caused by an unclean pneuma. Potential  therapeutic and exorcistic meanings can overlap here. This is particularly clear if  </page> <page sequence="14"> 278 Annette Weissenrieder we look once again at the Latin manuscripts. In the so-called Vetus Latina, the  Old Latin Bible manuscripts, which consists of manuscripts from the 2nd cen- tury C. E. on, terms refer to the action of eliminating the demons: “scolding,”  (see Luke 9:42) “throwing out” or “eliminating by force” increpare, eicere, exig- ere, excludere, expellere, or depellere. Some texts seem to take on the perspec- tive of the evil spirit when they speak of “quitting” and “decamping” – exire,  recedere, abscedere, absistere. In Roman medicine, one faces a medical phenom- enon: symptoms and diseases that may not have a corporeal existence are pre- sented as if they were physical objects, and they are indeed often associated with  predicates that imply they are animate, even human agents of the action of the  verb. Actions and states are also ascribed to body parts and remedies, which  include a notion of movement, aggressive attack, force, capacity, and occupa- tion. The medical historian D. R. Langslow calls this an “element of corpore- ality, animacy, and even anthropomorphism used for physiological processes”  (Langslow 2000, 194). The Gospel narratives do not reflect on the different  causes of epileptic seizures described above, nor do they raise the question of  convulsion coming from the heart or the brain. However, the symptoms seem  to reflect the ancient medical discussion in different ways. There are first of all  metaphors for an action of the human body, ranging from involuntary to vol- untary: Almost all manuscripts of the Vetus Latina of Mark and Matthew trans- late the polysemous Greek verbs ballō and ekballō with eicere in the European  text. Celsus has eicere for “vomiting” of bodily substances, Scribonius has rei- ectio and reicientes for “vomiting, bringing up” of poison, of blood and other  substances,25 and Cassius Felix uses reiactatio “vomiting, bringing up” of blood  or phlegm, from the verb used figuratively from its basic sense “to throw back  violently.” Luke often refers to mittere and dimittere. In the narrative on Peter’s moth- er-in-law, the fevers do bestow supernatural abilities and may be ascribed to the  evil powers that cause pain as mentioned in 4:36. These evil powers would then  be opposed by Jesus. This conclusion is contradicted, however, by examples in  ancient Roman medicine relating to the actions of diseases and remedies. The  medical historian Langslow thus refers to a disease “approaching or more aggres- sively attacking the patient, seizing the patient, letting him go, and departing.”26  Celsus uses decedere for the “abatement of an illness” and remittere (remissio) for  the “remission or abatement of an illness,” and he speaks mainly of fever as a dis- ease leaving the patient. In addition, he speaks of the even more aggressive notion  of occupare and occupatio, as we can also see in Luke’s version of the epileptic  boy (114.9). Finally, Cassius Felix uses dimittere as well as remittere and appre- hesio, or “seizure” of the senses, (see André 1963, 60 – 62, 65) and he also speaks  of an illness being born, nativitas, which refers to an illness’s initial growth.27 The  25 Scribonius Largus 47.22 – 23; 48.19; 49.1 with reference to sanguinis; 62.20 stercus per os  eicientem. 26 For the following see André 1963, 47 – 67 and Langslow 1992, 196. 27 Cf. André 1963, 65, with reference to Cass 38.1. (Vietmeier 1937, 53 – 54). </page> <page sequence="15"> “It Proceeded from the Entrance of a Demon into the Man” 279 results suggest, carefully expressed, that the terms eicere, dimittere and remittere  used in the Vetus Latina translation do not refer to exorcism, but are much more  like a medical description of an illness that was experienced by ancient medical  scientists as “approaching” or even “aggressively attacking” people (Langslow  1992, 196 ff.). The fact that fever was evaluated as one of these illnesses that seize  or occupy a person is obvious from these sources (Vietmeier 1937, 53 – 54). The  results suggest, carefully expressed, that the terms “to cast out” and “departing  of a demon” used in the Synoptic Gospels and its translations into Latin transla- tion do not refer to exorcism, but much more resemble a medical description of  an illness, which was experienced by ancient medical scientists as “approaching”  or even “aggressively attacking” people. The terminology is rather therapeutic  than exorcistic. 3. Conclusion Mental life is not just embedded in the world, but also evokes this world. Cogni- tion can be understood as the shaping of a meaningfully structured environment.  This creates access to a “deep continuity of life and mind” (Thompson 2010,  128). If we follow the ancient texts, this mental life is disrupted by the illness of  epilepsy – in the sense of a systematic disruption whose phenomenology is based  on a physiological disruption of human consciousness. All of the ancient texts  (including those of the New Testament) associate epilepsy with the loss of the  patient’s cognitive activity, the brain and the (unclean) air (pneuma), the blood,  the heart, or a demon. And all of the texts refer to the loss of sensory stimu-  li – blindness, deafness, or the ability to feel pain. Thus, all of these texts also  describe a loss of communication with the outside world. If we read the ancient  sources from the perspective of embodying the mind, the non-linear causality of  the interactions between mental and physical processes thus becomes clear.
