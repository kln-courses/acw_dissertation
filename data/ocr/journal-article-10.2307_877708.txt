<plain_text><page sequence="1">Baroque Art: The Jesuit Contribu- tion. By Rudolf Wittkower and Irma B. Jaffe. xvi + 139 pp. + 64 pls. + 6 text figs. (Fordham University Press, New York), $20. This book is a collection of seven essays based on papers read at a sym- posium at Fordham University. The title is somewhat deceptive in that the essays deal as much with the sixteenth as with the seventeenth century. As might be expected, there is no attempt to cover the field as a whole. The emphasis is overwhelmingly on art produced by and for the Jesuits in the city of Rome. The volume begins with an essay in which Professor Wittkower defines the boundaries of the theme. He starts with an affirmation of the often-repeated principle that there is no such thing as a Jesuit style distinctive from any other, then goes on to outline the contribution of various artists who were themselves Jesuits and of others who, while not Jesuits, were said to have been much influenced by Jesuit thought. Of these last the most problematical case remains that of the presumed collaboration of Pietro da Cortona with the Jesuit Gio- vanni Domenico Ottonelli on a treatise on painting and sculpture. The identifica- tion of Cortona (i.e., Berrettini) is based on an anagrammatic reading of the name 'Britio Prenetteri'. While this is technically convincing, the dry pedantic work is so foreign to anything else Cortona ever did that it might be worth the effort to see if the same letters could be rearranged to spell a different, more likely name. Another small point is worth noting. Wittkower writes (p.I I) : 'It can be shown that the Jesuits of the second half of the seventeenth century. . . for purely aes- thetic reasons. . . defended the inviol- ability of Bernini's church (Sant'Andrea) against any attempts at interference.' The documents on which Wittkower bases this statement refer to an incident that took place in the eighteenth century, not the seventeenth. The point is not without importance since in the eighteenth century we are no longer astonished to find a purely aesthetic point of view. Inevitably in a colloquium there is some repetition. Both Professor Ackerman, in his investigation of the sources for the design of the Ges u in Rome and Pro- fessor Haskell in his study of Jesuit patronage review the same douments and arrive at the same conclusions: it was not the desire of the Jesuits themselves but the wishes of a rich and powerful patron, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, that resulted in the choice of a vaulted roof for the church in place of a wooden one, in an emphasis on monumentality rather than simplicity, and in the selec- tion of a famous, highly innovative archi- tect, Vignola. Haskell then goes on to examine the thesis that, over and beyond the pressures of financial exigency, au- sterity was, at least to some extent, a matter of Jesuit policy up until the period when Gian Paolo Oliva was General of the Order (i 664-81). Ackerman, con- cerned with the aesthetics of the artist, not the patron, concludes with a brilliant analysis of the harmonies of the interior of the Ges u which he derives, entirely convincingly, from the use of a modular system, and with an equally interesting explanation of the effectiveness of della Porta's facade. By far the longest essay and also the most complex is that devoted by Pro- fessor Rene Taylor to the architectural reconstruction made by two Jesuit priests, the Spaniard Juan Bautista Villal- pando and the German Athanasius Kircher, both working under the pro- found influence of Hermetism. In Villal- pando's Temple of Solomon as in Kircher's Ark of Noah and Tower of Babel, Taylor demonstrates how the whole range of Hermetic concordances - astrology, nu- merology, anthropomorphism, the pseudo- Dionysian hierarchies, and even Cabalism - all come into play. Professor Culley's contribution is a study of the musical activities carried on throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries at the German College in Rome. Drawing on a body of documents here published for the first time, the author outlines a brilliant development which reached its high point during the long period (from 1629 to 1674) when Gia- como Carissimi served as maestro di cappella. Dr Bjurstr6m deals with the Jesuit theatre. On the basis of written descrip- tions and engravings, the author analyses the decorations used in the seventeenth century at the Church of the Gesil for the 340</page><page sequence="2">THE LITERATURE OF ART Quarantore performances, which served as an ecclesiastical answer to the cele- brations of Carnival. Of special interest are those sections in which Bjurstr6m translates the single unified space shown in the engraving into individual painted stage flats, comprising paired wings and a backdrop, which are then integrated with the real architecture of the church interior. In the final essay Professor Hibbard reconstructs the original iconographic programme of the Gesi' as it existed before the new decorations were added in the seventeenth century. Here, with the Jesuits for once in command in their own house, didactic considerations, at least at this early date, were predominant almost to the exclusion of anything else. In a valuable appendix Hibbard provides a history of the decorative programmes of each of the six nave chapels based not only on the published sources but also on previously uncited documents which permit him to add a good deal of new information. The illustrations include not only the paintings still in place but also lost works that are known only through engravings and, in at least one case (Scipione Pulzone's Pieta) a painting that passed into the art market and then disappeared. The symposium was unusually for- tunate in receiving financial support from two foundations and a number of private individuals. One of the results is the handsome design and production of this book.
