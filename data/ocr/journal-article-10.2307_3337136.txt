Roberts One hundred and seven Mangbetu objects were selected by Alain Guisson from private collections in Belgium for an exhibition at the Kredietbank's gallery in downtown Brussels. The exhibition, open to the public free of charge, was well attended on the weekday in late October when my daughter and I visited. A great many posters and fliers for "Mangbetu" were distributed in and around the city, notably in restaurants and storefronts of the Matonge African "enclave," where at places like Chez Henri they competed with popular art, concert announcements, and anti-Mobutu literature. The location of the exhibition in the Grand-Place, commercial hub of Brussels, underscored the importance as well as some of the ironies of African-art col- lecting in Belgium today. This was the first Belgian exhibition whol- ly given to Mangbetu art, and as Kredietbank president Marcel Cockaerts writes in his intro- duction to the catalogue, because Belgian pri- PHOTO: DICK BEAULIEUX Anthropomorphic box.

So much for the Royal Museum for Central Africa and the other great public collections in Belgium! From an outsider's viewpoint, this choice seems to reflect the odd alienation from formal study of African culture that characterizes contemporary efforts to come to grips with Belgium's colonial heritage, as well as tension between private collectors and dealers on the one hand, and Belgian scholars on the other. In the fliers, too, it was noted that the objects were "selected on the basis of their quality," yet no effort was made to identify by whose estimation of quality or by what criteria the selection was made. A brief write-up in Sabena's in-flight magazine added another twist: "The wealth of privately owned art col- lections in Belgium is kept well hidden from the prying eyes of thieves and tax assessors. But on special occasions, the owners can be induced to let the rest of us take a peep at some of their treasures" (Passport, Oct. 1992, p. 39). And so they have done in "Mangbetu"- although one is left wondering what induce- ment was offered to the collectors, and what tax assessors may think of being mentioned in the same breath as thieves! One contributor admitted to me that the "tax assessor's prying eyes" did influence his choice of what he agreed to lend to the exhibition, and, indeed, the largest figures, which represent the great- est value on the art market, were borrowed from collectors who retained their anonymity. The glass doors and welcoming bright lights of the Galerie de la Kredietbank con- trasted with the overcast skies and cold damp- ness, the imposingly ornate yet somehow decadent gilt facades of the Grand-Place, and the gray and gloomy atmosphere of Brussels in early fall. Objects in the exhibition were nicely varied, including knives, scepters, hats, stools, headrests, pots, figurative harps, and ivory trumpets decorated with pictographs. A warmly rich reddish-brown barkcloth was especially beautiful, and its regular patterns of painted stripes and geometric figures brought to mind an interesting contrast with the more free-flowing motifs of Mbuti barkcloths. Seven stools, all with complexly carved single sup- ports, demonstrated the virtuosity of Mang- betu woodwork. Several were studded with brass carpet tacks, and one was banded with copper. Two vitrines, each with a fan of ivory hairpins, stole the show. The fine and intricate carving of the pins along with the displays themselves made for a dandy postcard that was for sale at the entryway. Didactic materials on the walls included catalogue text and early photos. My fourteen- year-old daughter was most struck by pho- tographs illustrating the effects of head- binding on infants whose consequent bug-eyed gaze is rather alarming. No mention was made of the contemporary circumstances of Mangbetu or of their current forms of expression. Opposite the entrance stood the male and female figures shown on exhibition fliers, posters, and the catalogue cover. The dramat- ic, tall (70 cm) pair have a reddish-yellow patina that glowed under the bright lights of the gallery and set off the body painting, scarification, elongated heads, and elaborate coiffures for which Mangbetu are famous in the West.

Given Professor Burssens's close adherence to the tenets of African Reflections: Art from Northeastern Zaire (Enid Schildkrout and Curtis Keim, 1990) and its authors' postmodernist treatise on the invention of Mangbetu through anthropo- morphic art largely inspired by and made for Europeans, a question can be raised about the choice of this pair of figures as the exhibition emblem. Certain turn-of-the-century pho- tographs reproduced in the exhibition and catalogue, especially one of a naked woman seated on a stool, showed a demeaning exoti- cism, when other photos showed women and men wearing the ornate belts, painted bark- cloth skirts and wraps, and geometrically decorated negbe "seat-covers" (cache-seants) that were some of the most interesting objects of the exhibition. So, why were these figures chosen? Because they are of the highest "quality," or because they best encapsulate what it was to be "Mangbetu" (that is, from a Western perspective)? Other figures included a remarkable "abstract" and unsexed pair that are not so well known or widely published as the emblematic figures, but are easily as com- pelling. Might they not have made a better choice for the exhibition's publicity? Or was the eroto-exoticism of the emblematic pair used to draw people into the exhibition? In other words, is such an image what West- ern viewers want and expect to find in Mangbetu? I wish I had had the prescience to ask African diners at Chez Henri what they thought of the exhibition flier taped to the inside of the front window, the two Mangbetu figures gazing down on us as we relished our Anthropomorphic harp.

While my views may smack of political correctness or a Connecticut Yankee's prud- ishness, a sensitive consideration of the invention of Africa ought to have informed this exhibition, especially given the position of Schildkrout and Keim, which Burssens so often echoes in his catalogue text. Oppor- tunities for a constructive presentation of issues were missed, starting with the exhibi- tion's publicity.
