<plain_text><page sequence="1">The inculturation of theology in the Chinese Church Introduction Much has been written about China, about the Chinese Church, and even about Chinese theology. The last topic, which alone concerne us, deals in fact with the inculturation of theolo gy in the Chinese Church. This is an old problem. But its urgency is better understood today, not only because of the great transformation which the Chinese society has undergone in the last decades, but also because of the willingness which the Church has manifested during its Second Vatican Council to meet positively other religions and the world in general. As a matter of fact, discussion about the possibility of a Chinese theology had already begun at least twenty years ago, and many tentative works related to this matter have since been published. More than fìve years ago, the Chinese bishops in Taiwan started promoting the inculturation of the Church or, as they called it, «The Building of the Locai Church », and in the meantime much more work has been going on. Limiting myself to the study of literature published in Chinese by Catho lics, I intend to develop in this article the following three points: 1. The attempts at theological inculturation made by the Chinese Church in the past; 2. The present state of research; and 3. The future tasks of theologians.</page><page sequence="2">6 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.X. I - The Attempts at Theological Inculturation Made by the Chinese Church in the Past By « the past », I mean from a few years before the Second Vatican Council up to the year 1976 in which the Chinese Bishops' Conference announced « The Building of the Locai Church ». At the very start of this introduction, I have to explain that the materials I used here are limited to literature published in Chinese by Catholics. The works done in this field by Protestant brethren are indeed noteworthy. The ac complishments of the several theologians among them are in ternationally known and recognized as important, but they are not presented in this report. For the sake of clarity, I will first introduce the discus sion by considering the methods used in the past; then I will come to the content of the Chinese theology which was en visioned. 1. The Methods of Theological Inculturation In 1972 much discussion took place about Chinese Theology in Taiwan. The participants were theologians, philosophers and other priests engaged in pastoral work. They gathered various opinions, analyzed them and sufficiently clarified the meaning of theological inculturation.1 In a positive sense, this term means the enchancement and communication of divine revela tion through its adaptation to currnt Chinese thought and through the creation of a new Chinese culture which has as similated the Gospel message. Although they put emphasis on present-day thought, they nonetheless admitted that the latter must be related to China's ancient cultural tradition. Further more, inculturation of the Gospel in China must be done within the universal Church and in harmony with Western theology, so that the one complements the other. Therefore, in a nega tive sense, « locai » theology is not revivifìcation of old tradì ι Vox Clerici, voi. 10, no. 2, pp. 63-76. Feb. 1972.</page><page sequence="3">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 7 tions and customs, not isolationism, and, of course, not adher ence to the Scholastic theology of the past. It also became clear that the development of a Chinese theology is not the responsibility solely of theology professore; it is rather the task of the entire Chinese Church. Theology is the reflection and expression of the life of the locai Church. Unless the « grassroots » Church is active, unless it seeks to adapt its faith to changing circumstances and explain it in accordance with them, its members cannot create a theology that is alive, in sightful and prophetic. The specialized function of theologians is to reflect in a scientific and systematic way on the lived life of indigenous faith. Finally, some participants in the dis cussion suggested that it is necessary to establish an « Associa tion for the Study of Locai Theology», composed either of individuals or of communities so that progress could be made on many fronts by the division of labor.2 II In fact, long before this recent discussion on locai theology by Chinese clergy in general, several individuals had already expressed their opinions on the method to be used. In his article written in 1959 and entitled « My humble view on the basis of the establishment of Chinese Catholic Culture », Tien Liang proposed the idea that one might organize Chinese theology by allowing the concept of filial piety to form its basis.3 His thought is quite systematic. Although it is true that only a few received his ideas enthusiastically, from the historical point of view his work is worthy of being recalled briefly so as to demonstrate that even before the Second Vati can Council there existed an interest in Chinese theology. The article of Tien Liang is divided into three parts. In the first of these he explains in everyday language the results of his in-depth study on the meaning of filial piety: starting from the meaning of this term in the strictest sense, he goes on to treat the sacrificial tradition of the Book of Rites, and finally, em 2 See Chou Ke-ch'in, After my Reading of "What is Your Opinion about Theological Inculturation?', Vox Clerici, voi. 10, no. 4, pp. 46-52, Aprii 1972. 3 Tien Liang, My Humble View on the Establishment of a Chinese Catholic Culture, New Vox Clerici, voi. 5, no. 26, pp. 33-46, Nov. 1959.</page><page sequence="4">8 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. ploying the Book of Filial Piety as the basis, he gradually reveals the full meaning of filial piety. But, in order to estab lish a Chinese Catholic culture, the author does not adopt the traditional meaning of filial piety, but formulates a definition of his own and understands it as the possible foundation for a common language which could unite the wisdom both of China and of the Western world. According to his opinion, filial piety is the implement of Jen (humanity) and Li (the prin ciple) which originate from God, spread out over the universe, and are engraved on human hearts. The way of filial piety includes the way of man, the way of things, and the way of Heaven. The way of man is knowable to him because it comes from the clear light of reason; but the degrees of knowledge are different in different people; only the sage knows it in its totality. The way of things comes from the universe; therefore, one has to undertake an investigation of things so as to gain knowledge of them. The way of Heaven comes from revelation and has Jesus as its source; one can know the authentic mean ing of filial piety only by contemplating Christ. In the second part, Tien Liang offers a well structured systematic treatment of filial piety. Starting from his own definition, he insists that in heaven and on earth, in the past and in the future, ali knowledge without exception can be gathered under the con cepì of filial piety. Theologically speaking, the Holy Trinity may be regarded as the foundation and source of filial piety. Creation is His infinite love externalized. Incarnation consists in the fact that the Son, by His own example, teaches men how to serve God with filial piety. The seven Sacramente are instruments helping people to worship the Heavenly Father as true sons. In Christian fife, filial piety is manifested as faith, hope, charity and « propriety » which is keeping oneself within the bounds of the Father's will. In the field of spirituality, the way of filial piety is the basis of perfection since the latter consists in honoring and loving the Heavenly Father in imita tion of Christ. The main thrust of the theology of filial piety is directed not to the search for knowledge, so that one grasps the way of Heaven, but to action, so that piety is realized in daily fife. Thus, once again, filial piety is viewed as the uni fying principle of Jen and Li. In the third part, Tien Liang emphasizes the value of a theological system based on the way</page><page sequence="5">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 9 of fìlial piety. From the negative point of view, he criticizes the inadequate methods used by other scholars in the work of inculturation, for they ali take the Confucianist concepì Jen as their sole starting point, and regard the union of Heaven and man as their aim. But in the Thirteen Books of Classics, it is not Jen which is regarded as the basis of perfection. Filial piety, on the other hand, captures the very essence of Confucianism. It can be understood and put into practice by everyone, even by the most common people. Therefore, a theology that centers on fìlial piety is attractive, dynamic and practical. After the publication of Tien Liang's article there were some strong reactions. The scholar who conducted the most heated argument with him was Chang Tien-tseng.4 As a mat ter of fact, if we look at the debate from today's standpoint, Tien Liang's thoughts contain several elements which do not stand up to criticism. As a result, his article is hardly dis cussed any longer. Nevertheless, since he was a pioneer in the work of theological inculturation, it is necessary to men tion him. In fact, he not only investigated the most funda mental attitude of the Chinese soul but also tried to explain Christian revelation in its light. However, his exaggerated inclination towards systematization led him to a serious error. He fabricated a defìnition of filial piety which no Chinese scholar would accept. Thus his failure was a necessary con sequence of his zeal for harmony. Thus his failure was a necessary consequence of his zeal for harmony. On the other hand, he forced people to pay more attention to methodology. Ili 1) After the Second Vatican Council, which in various docu ments advocated inculturation, those who were engaged in theological reflection on the Chinese Church began to center on this problem seriously. Two foreign professors of theology 4 Chang Tien-tseng, After my Reading of 'The Laying of the Founda tion of the Chinese Catholic Culture', New Vox Clerici, voi. 5, no. 28, pp. 93-94, March 1960; Chang Tien-tseng, Can the Concepì of Filial Piety be a Scientific Basis? — A Further Discussion, Ibid. voi. 5, no. 31, pp. 82 90, Nov. 1960; Tien Liang, An Answer to the Questions of Chang Tien-tseng Concerning the Concepì of Filial Piety, Ibid. pp. 91-95.</page><page sequence="6">10 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. are especially to be noted for expressing their opinions on this matter. In his «Speculative Theology and the Chinese Way of Thinking »,5 Father Luis Gutheinz, S J., an Austrian, offered a general description of the Chinese character by ob serving that they love concrete expressions, symbolic meanings and intuitive understanding. Therefore, the Chienese can rightly say that their way of thinking comes close to that of the Bible and to its method of expressing truth. Gutheinz says: « When the Chinese penetrate into the spirit of the Bible they can better grasp the aspects of human sentiment and intimacy in the redemptive work than the people of the West. The Chinese lay more stress on the problems of man: the totality of man, the great « Way » of the moral realization of man, and the feeling of the intimate relationship between man and the universe. »6 As a theologian of the West, he points out that, although Chinese thought does not underestimate the fun damental relationship and the essential difference between the Creator and the created, it is inclined to existential analysis. Western theology has emphasized divine transcendence so much that divine immanence has been neglected. The Chinese, on the other hand, underscore the immanence of the Absolute (the Supreme Ultimate) so that its transcendence seems to be ob scured. But in reality this is the contribution which the Chinese can make to Catholic theology. Finally, since the « Way » is also an important concept in traditional Chinese thought, Father Gutheinz suggests that the fundamental truths of Catholicism could be expressed in terms of the Way: the divine revelation which is contained both in the Old and in the New Testaments is the way; God is im manent in the universe through Christ—the way; the human race is saved by accepting Christ—who is the way, the truth, and the life; the holy life of Christians in the way and their unending life with the Holy Trinity is the completion of the way of man. Having been exposed to these ideas, the reader of this book might immediately recali the excellent article it contains by Father S. Lyonnet. Unfortunately, Father Gut heinz did not pursue further research on the Chinese concept of way as has been done by Father Joseph Shih, S.J. 5 Luis Gutheinz, Speculative Theology and the Chinese Way of Think ing, Vox Clerici, voi. 4, no. 10 and 11, pp. 83-85, July and August 1966. 6 Ibid. p. 85.</page><page sequence="7">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH II 2) A second key article was written by Father Paul Welte, O.P., a German Professor of theology.7 Although its content does not directly touch on indigenous Chinese theology, it stili treats basic principles. Here we will not consider Father Welte's concrete suggestions on such matters as how to train locai theologians and professors, how to establish seminaries of different kinds, etc. But the seven points which he indicates concerning « The Form of Orientalized Theology » are quite relevant for those engaged in the work of inculturation. 1. Ali Christian theological systems have the same fun damental object which is the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached in the Church. Therefore, Orientai and Occi dental theology should strive for the unity which reflects the one Lord. 2. Theologians both of the East and of the West possess the same human nature; therefore, their way of thinking is fundamentally the same. Furthermore, since the cultural communication between the East and the West is becoming more intense each day, more common points of view exist now than before. 3. However, in many questions their thoughts and their cultural backgrounds are different so that they nat urally would stress different aspects of revelation and so that their theology would also vary. Though they may be different, they should not contradict each other. On the contrary, the one should supplement the other. 4. If Christian theology is to adopt a certain system of thought, the system in question must be examined in every detail; it should be purified and its real value should be studied with the message of Christ as its norm. Be sides, the theologian must continually ask whether or not this thought can be understood by modem Asians without causing them to misunderstand the Catholic Church. 5. Such a theology must focus its attention on the thought and concerns for modem Asians and then con struct pastoral approaches which are guided by the revela tion of God. Therefore, theological « orientalization » is equivalent to theological modernization. This kind of work is absolutely necessary not only in the East but also in the West. 7 Paul Welte, My Humble View on Theological Inculturation in China, Ibid. voi. 5, no. 2, pp. 50-57, Nov. 1966.</page><page sequence="8">12 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. 6. Orientalization will invariably color Christian the ology as a whole, but through this process it helps the Church more fully to adapt to the needs of modem man. 7. At times Eastern theologians searching for ways to inculturate the Gospel may have doubts about the ad equacy of various explanations in Western theology; for example, whether the relationship between God the Father and God the Son is too much dominated by the Western family structure, and whether it properly represents the originai meaning of the Bible. The theologians in the Orient may ask if Western theology understands originai sin thoroughtly. Is their explanation sufficient enough so that people in the East can grasp it.8 These seven points urge indigenous theology to strive for harmony with the entire Catholic Church on the one hand, and not to be afraid of pluralism on the other. Father Welte, in accordance with the decree of the Second Vatican Council, sug gests that, while they aim at a needed and healthy diversity, Orientai theologians must foster a more profound understand ing of the mysteries of faith within their own culture. In the light of the same council's desire that theologians study the mysteries and their internai connection,9 Father Welte writes: How shall we study the connection of the mysteries? Shall we do so by intellectually analyzing the concepts of faith? Or can theologians in the East understand the connection by using other methods? Vatican II in the Dogmatic Constitution on Revelation (no. 8) tells us that the development of faith comes about through the con templation, the reading and the experience of spiritual things on the part of the believer. In other words, pro gress in faith is not obtained by theoretical analysis; it results from the direct and profound contact of the faith ful with the mysteries themselves. People of East Asia are more prone to the contem plative or intuitive life. They are always cairn, unhurried and composed. Orientai Catholics, both male and iemale, are very patient in reciting the rosary and in meditation on the way of our Lord's passion. Therefore, in order to understand the connection between the mysteries, the 8 IbicL., ρ. 56. » Denzinger-Sch8nmetzer, 3016.</page><page sequence="9">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 13 most proper means for Orientai theologians is possibly the way of intuition brought about by contemplation, and not the way of logicai analysis. Moreover, in addition to the objective connection be tween the mysteries themselves, there is a connection between the subjective reactions caused by believing in them. Can these reactions lead people from one mystery to another? Is the method by which we study the con nection between such subjective reactions the same as that by which we investigate their objective connection? 10 Father Welte deals at length with the mandate of Vatican I that theologians search for the relationship between the mys teries and human life, since he is convinced that this insight deserves the attention of Orientai theologians. Thus he says: If we study the relationship between the mysteries and human life, we can understand more profoundly the mysteries of faith. But the different circumstances of real life might raise different problems. For instance, Paul in his Letter to the Romans was particularly con cerned with the degenerate state of the Jewish religion, the fate of the Jews, and the place they occupied in God's redemptive work. Since he himself was a Jew, he was passionately involved in the fate of his fellow countrymen. In the same way, a Chinese theologian is certainly touched by the fate of his countrymen and ponders the role of the Chinese cultural history of five thousand years in the divine redemptive pian. Besides, he will also want to study how the truth of redemption in Jesus Christ satisfies the demands of the Orientai heart. To put it in a nutshell, if with regard to dogmatic aspects of theology the method of speculation is different, the development of theology... should also be different.11 3) The two European theologians whose thoughts have been presented can teach theology in fluent Chinese, but they feel that their knowledge of Chinese culture is so limited that they prefer to confine themselves to the question of method. Both of them unanimously admit that the real work must be done by the Chinese themselves. However, they continue to 10 Ibid., ρ. 54. 11 Ibid.</page><page sequence="10">14 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. express their helpful points of view whenever opportunity arises. In fact, Father Gutheinz published another article in 1968 entitled « Theology in China ».12 Here he tries to discern the direction in which modem Chinese culture is heading and, in the light of his fìndings, he points out the tasks which lie ahead of Chinese theology. According to Fr. Gutheinz, Chinese culture has always taken man as its basis, and this humanism is ali the more evident among modem Chinese thinkers. Due to the social changes, however, the inner harmony and the ethical demands which were affirmed by the tradition are now called into question and even are being lost. Therefore, in his opinion, only an anthro pology which has Christ as its center can contribute to the growth of Chinese culture. Christ is God meeting us as a typical « man ». Humanism can attain to its completion, then, only if it chooses Christ. The author also finds that Chinese culture has gradually departed from a cyclic view of time to a rectilinear one. Furthermore, because of social and economie development, the needs of laborers are growing day by day. In this period of transformation, the Chinese people have need of a progressive and indigenous theology which can break through a static value-system and offer the Chinese people a new sense of security. Such a theology may also urge modem man to participate in world activities but at the same time to learn the need for indifference to them. It may lend impetus to the renewed discovery of harmony between man and things and to a hopeful trust in the unintelligible providence of God. Finally, Chinese theologians have to think out a theology in which God is seen to be present in one's brothers since ali belong to the same family and recognize God as the benevolent Father. The book entitled, « God and man belong to one family », written by Fr. Chao Pin-shih, resonates quite well with the last point made by Fr. Gutheinz. IV 1. In 1970 the work of theological inculturation received new impetus. In the spring of that year, the Bishops represent 12 My Humble View on 'Theology in China', Ibid., voi. 6, no. 10, and 11, pp. 36-40, July and August 1968.</page><page sequence="11">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 15 ing China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Hong Kong and Macao carne together in Hong Kong for their very first joint meeting. There they took up the question of an indigenous theology. Ali the representatives agreed that such adaptation is a necessary ele ment of mission work. They also decided that the different bishops' conferences should encourage studies and publications about theological inculturation in their respective areas. Bishop Ch'eng Shih-kuang of the Tainan Diocese was elected to serve as coordinator of this exterprise. Soon thereafter Bishop Ch'eng invited to Taiwan about ten experts in theology and philosophy; they met twice in order to discuss means of initiating this dif ficult and epoch-making task. In fact, the books « God and man belong to one family » by Fr. Chao and « Boundary be tween God and man » by Bishop Ch'eng himself were the pro ducts of the sessions. In 1973, the Bishops representing China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Hong Kong and Macao held a second meeting in Taiwan and debated the very same issue. 2. It is understandable that because of the urgent plea of the bishops the efforts to promote theological inculturation increased in Taiwan. What were some of the results of these initiatives? Most striking is the thought of Bishop Ch'eng who has been writing for some time. In 1972 he produced an article, published in the « Vox Clerici »,13 in which he recommended that moral theology should adopt the Chinese ethical system and add to it the treatise on the sacraments as found in Cath olic moral theology in the West. The traditional Catholic ethics is not suitable to the psychology of the Chinese, because: « The ethics to which the Chinese people are accustomed has moral virtues as its center. But the ethics preached by the Catholic Church has law as its center. »14 Unfortunately, Catholic ethics often emphasizes meticulous distinctions between right and wrong and between serious and less serious sins; in addition, the stress on spirituality is far too limited and the presenta tion of Church laws far too extensive. As a result, the bishops and priests raised on this ethics can seem to be like cold hearted and unfeeling specialists who, instead of preaching love, 13 Ch'eng Shih-kuang, A Few Words Concernine Theological Incultura· tion, Vox Clerici, voi. 10, no. 7, pp. 22-25, July 1972. Μ Ibid., p. 23.</page><page sequence="12">16 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. mercy and equality, draw up legai documents and determine penalties. Chinese ethics, on the other hand, encourages the total self-culturation of the individuai and does not lose sight of this goal by over-emphasizing particulars. The ancients, though con cerned about self-cultivation, did not deny the existence of sins which are consequences of neglecting one's genuine humanity. This positive spiritual attitude, says Bishop Ch'eng, represents the perennial value of Chinese ethics. Therefore, an indigenous moral theology could have Chinese ethics as its « wood » and the Sacramente as its « spark »; together they could break out into a fire warming the entire atmosphere. In this way, there would emerge a Christian ethics which is suited to the Chinese mood. Is it possible to create a moral theology for the Chinese Church by adopting Chinese traditional ethics and by linking to them the moral implications of sacramentai practice? Many agree to his way of thinking and the question is stili open to further discussion. In the introduction to his later work « The Boundary be tween God and Man », Bishop Ch'eng says: « This book has blended dogmatic and moral theology, Christology and spiritual ity together into a unity. From the viewpoint of Western tradi tional theology, this may seem very odd. But from the view point of Chinese humanism, it is a very normal thing. For, whether Confucianists, Taoists or Mohists, ali of them have been walking on this way; they have melted the way of Heaven and the way of man into one furnace and have united the worship of Heaven with living a human life; they did not discuss the question of Heaven and the question of man separately, but combined them, making the way of man vigilant by the way of Heaven and manifesting the way of Heaven by the way of man. »15 This passage indicates that Bishop Ch'eng was willing to break out of the Western mold, abandon the Western literary style, and write an impressive and soon famous book which was on everybody's lips. Undoubtedly it points to a method which Chinese theology should not ignore. Encouraged by the several meetings convened by Bishop Ch'eng, people began to reflect on the fundamental method of 15 Ch'eng Shih-kuang, The Boundary Between Heaven and Man, Win Tao Publishing Company, 1974, p. 5.</page><page sequence="13">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 17 Chinese theology. Indeed a notable contributor was Doctor Hsiang Twei-chieh who voiced the opinion that we should transcend the rigid distinctions between dogma, ethics and rites, a classification produced in the West. Instead, he sug gested that the theology both of the East and of the West should be divided into two main parts: 1) the « view of life and salvation », and 2) the « history of salvation and the fate of man ».16 The thought of Doctor Hsiang is creative, for dogma, ethics and rites are blended into an over-arching vision. Yet, as Fr. Gutheinz has observed, the distinction between dogma, ethics and rites should not be called a produci of Western culture, but springs from the very dynamism of the human intellect and is thus universally valid.17 Besides the work of Dr. Hsiang Twei-chieh, a second notable contribution was made during the period after theological inculturation was promoted by the Association of Eastern Asian Bishops. Bishop Chang Wei-tu also wrote an article which played a significant role in encouraging the further development of an indigenous Chinese theology.18 In the above four sections we have related the various opinions on the method to be used in promoting the theological inculturation of the Chinese Church. Before concluding this report of the former attempts, we are going to mention an article written by Yang Ku-ch'eng, « What is theological in culturation? »19 Although the article deals with the main theme of indigenous theology, other minor themes run through it. Therefore, we shall offer a summary which concentrates only on the essential and pertinent points. First: the author seems to be very much concerned about 16 Hsiang Twei-cheh, My Humble View on. South Asiati Theology, Vox Clerici, voi. 10, no. 8 and 9, pp. 18-22, Sept. 1972. 17 Luis Gutheinz, Some Questione about 'My Humble View on South Asian Theology', Ibid. voi. 11, no. 6, pp. 13-16, June 1973. 18 Chang Wei-tu, After my Reading of Ά Few Words Concerning Theological Inculturation', Ibid. voi. 11, no. 10, pp. 1-5, Dee. 1972.

But he states that most of the work done so for is « both clear and obscure ». First of ali, why has it produced so few results? Fundamentally it is because « those who only study Chinese culture cannot produce effective research... Those who learn about Chinese culture cannot grasp its historical and experiential tradition and its vibrant, unfailing spirit; they cannot understand the traditional view point concerning God; ... they only manage to quote the sources ... »20 Thus, the task of theological inculturation pre supposes a mastery of the traditional spirit of Chinese culture and the ability to express it in a modem thought-structure. As regards the formation of an indigenous theology, it is neces sary to express Christian faith in one's own cultural terms and at the same time to make a further adaptation to the « structure of cultural thought » and to its « external mode of realizing itself. » Second: the author returns once more to the tension be tween the unity of revelation and the multiplicity of cultures. Hence the Biblical language in which the mysteries are revealed must be explained in terms of a particular native culture. « ... In order that a given people may be able to accept the mysteries of revelation and to understand them profoundly, theologians should explain and express the revealed mysteries and truths in the thought patterns of various cultures, in the light of the diverse social situations, and in terms of a theology which can be understood by modem man... Theologians must be able to grasp thoroughly and to evaluate without prejudice the theories of different schools; they must know their merits and defects; and they must, by accepting their merits and refusing their defects, supplement them with the aid of revealed truths. »21 This is no doubt a fine concrete description of the goal of inculturation. Third: Yang further delineates the aim of developing an indigenous theology. It must correspond to individuai and social needs; it must answer the eternai questions of the human heart. In this way, inculturation can be both faithful to the revealed truths of God and incorporate the values of Christ 20 Ibid., ρ. 17. 21 lbid., ρ. 23.</page><page sequence="15">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 19 into a locai culture with ali its unique historical and social dimensions. Fourth: the author considers the relation between incultura tion and the expressions of religious experience. The latter can be divided into the following three forms: theological thinking, ritual actions, and community organizations. The author then focuses too narrowly on ritual adaptation, parish organization, and economie questions concerning the self-sufficiency of the Church in Taiwan. Ali of these issues deal more indirectly than directly with the task of theological inculturation. We can conclude this presentation of what Chinese theo logians have written about the methodology to be adopted for the sake of genuine inculturation by summarizing the foregoing pages in the following way: 1. That revealed mysteries be expressed in terms of Chinese culture is the fundamental task of inculturation. Of course, so that the orthodoxy of the Catholic faith be preserved, Chinese theology should not be opposed to the theologies of other locai Churches but should complement them. 2. An indigenous theology is not simply a translation of Western theology into Chinese terms; it is rather a reflection on divine revelation which is carried out with respect for the preferences, sentiments, and intuitions of the Chinese people, and with respect for the spirit of Chinese culture. In a real sense, inculturation means a development of dogma and an enrichment of faith. Thus, theological adaptation is the result of the lively and probing faith of the locai Church. 3. Culture, tliough its source is rooted in the past, stili expresses the life and the way of thinking of modera man. Hence one can legitimately say that theological inculturation is theological modernization. 4. The work of theological adaptation should have the effect of purifying and elevating the locai Church. This is the mean ing of the last part of the repeated saying of Cardinal Yu Pin: « Christ is to be transformed into Chinese and China is to be transformed into Christ. » 5. Many people think that Chinese theology need not follow the divisions opted for by Western theology. Rather it should develop an harmonious system by itself. Unfortunately, there have been no adequate discussions of this important matter.</page><page sequence="16">20 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. There are certainly fundamental points made here. No doubt the reseach should continue in order to uncover more subtle problems, such as that between faith and reason in Chinese culture. Once the work of inculturation progresses, theologians will be able to isolate such issues more easily. Just consider the concrete gains which Chinese theology has made in the past twenty years! 2. The Search for Common Theological Concepts First of ali, I must admit that it would be simply impos sible to give a detailed account of the actual content treated in the works which were published by the Catholic theologians during the past twenty years. It is even difficult to write a synthetic introduction to them. But speaking in general terms, one can say that the articles of this period consist mainly in comparing the common or similar concepts between the Bible and traditional Chinese culture; sometimes they also attempi to interpret the Bible and the actions of Jesus Christ in terms of the moral virtues which are considered important by the Chinese people. Occasionally a work will hypothetically reflect on how God is bringing about the salvation of the Chinese. I 1. It is undeniable that in the traditional culture of the Chinese people, « filial piety » and « Jen » (humanity) are the two cardinal concepts which include ali the other virtues. The way of filial piety which was developed among later Con fucianists become as well the way of attaining self-cultivation, of governing a nation, and of regulating the world. Therefore, the speculative efforts at theological inculturation have fre quently dealt with comparing Chinese filial piety and Christian faith. It is undeniable as well that, in this respect, the works of Tien Liang are most numerous. We have already related his ambitious pian to organize a Chinese Catholic theology around the concept filial piety. Here we should at least men tion his two other lengthy articles, namely, « The language and the value of worshipping God with filial piety in the New</page><page sequence="17">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 21 Testament »,B and « The value of serving Heaven with filial piety in the New Testament ».B Since we already know of his penchant towards systematization, it is not difficult to imagine that he would interpret ali the words and actions of Jesus in terms of filial piety. And furthermore, he views the piety of Jesus as a corrective to the insufficiency of the Chinese tradi tional filial piety. Here we just mention a very interesting point which should make those engaged in theological work aware of how time-conditioned their thought is. Filial piety, in ancient China implied the following obligation: « During their lifetime, serve them with propriety; after their death, bury them and honor them with proper rites. » Tien Liang is forcibly against the idea « honor them with proper rites », because he thinks that this practice includes the worship of spirits which the teaching of Jesus excluded. According to Tien Liang, it is true that we should remember the dead and never forget them during our lifetime, but, since honoring them with certain rites is useless, it must therefore be abandoned. We wonder whether the fact that Cardinal Yu Pin has promoted the rites of offer ing sacrifices to heaven and paying honor to ancestors will cause Tien Liang to modify his opinion. (With regard to the rites of offering sacrifices to heaven and paying honor to ancestors, works of a profound theological nature are very rare; therefore there is unfortunately no mention of them in this article.) 2. Archbishop Stanislaus Lo Kuang pointed out that the filial piety practised by the Catholic Church in the West has been too influenced by the spirit of the Roman Empire. As a result, one's sense of duty and right is very strong. When the children are born, their parents protect them and raise them; as the children grow up, the parents provide them an education. These are their duties as parents. As regards their rights, the children belong to them, so that no one can take 22 Tiek Liang, The Sayings of the New Τest ameni and their Value Concerning the Worship of God with the Virtue of Filial Piety, New Vox Clerici, voi. 5, no. 27, pp. 34-59, Jan. 1960 and voi. 5, no. 28, pp. 26-40, March 1960. 23 Tien Liang, The Value of Worshipping God with Filial Piety in the New Testament, New Vox Clerici, voi. 5, no. 29, pp. 30-44, May 1960.</page><page sequence="18">22 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. them away from them. The children should in turn obey and honor their parents, who have a right to be treated in this way. As for the concepì of filial piety among the Confucianists, it regards life and not duty as its basis. The life of the children comes from their parents, and they live their lives in order to show that their ancestors continue to exist.24 This being the case, should the tenor of Chinese filial piety be assimilated by the Catholic faith? 3. A Christian lay scholar, Mr. Liang Tzu-han, has observed that a long time ago our ancestors had already developed a metaphysics in which « parents are compared to heaven ». The Confucian philosophy of man regarded the imitation of heaven as its ideal, and the union between heaven and man as its aim. Heaven is the source of ali creation and, since parents bear children, they are the proximate causes, but heaven is the remote cause of them. Because they want to return to and contemplate their source, men should serve and honor their parents just as they serve and honor heaven. The way of filial piety leads man up to heaven through his parents; thus, one is to honor heaven through filial piety. This means that the Confucianists place the parents between heaven and the human person, so that filial piety obtains a religious significance. At the same time Mr. Liang said that the way of filial piety of Jesus himself is to do the will of the heavenly Father and to show filial piety towards His holy Mother. Thus the Chinese Christians can be raised by the salvation of Jesus from the level of Confucian filial piety to a higher one; this means that Orientai culture can accept the baptism of Christ.25 4. Though an important contribution, the approach of Mr. Liang Tzuhan is nonetheless insufficient, as the moral theo logian, Chin Hsiang-kuei, has pointed out: « Solely placing the Chinese way of filial piety and that of the Christian side by side has indeed laid a foundation for theological inculturation, but in the last analysis it stili skirts the kernel of the problem. 24 Lo Kuang, The Way of Filial Piety in the Catholic Church, Chinese Catholic Culture, no. 1, pp. 30-32, pril 1974. 25 Liang Tzu-han, The Views on Filial Piety of the Confucianists and of the Catholic Church, Heng-Yi Monthly, voi. 9, no. 1, pp. 21-26, Jan. 1959.</page><page sequence="19">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 23 For, by stressing the idea that « parents are compared to heaven », and by insisting on the supernatural basis of filial piety, many do take a step forward. Yet they can give the wrong impression that religion is a power coming from out side, having no internai basis in the heart of man. This tendency may be due to the education in moral theology receiv ed by those who now teach filial piety: the external moral law is over-emphasized. »26 As a matter of fact, though Fr. Chin does not fully accept the theory of filial piety advocated by Tien Liang, he has attempted on his own to offer a meta physical basis for including filial piety in Chinese Catholic theo logy. Because of its valuable contribution to theology, this approach should be mentioned here. Fr. Chin quotes a con temporary philosopher, Mr. Hsu Fu-kuan, who takes human love as his starting point and explains the significance of filial piety for human society today. Filial piety is « the necessary and naturai manifestation of the love at the inner heart of man. » Only if one has such love and responds to the dictates of practical reason, can one transcend his physical limitations, contain his selfishness and direct himself to the love of the human race, which is the state of Jen as it is called by the Confucianists. Therefore, « filial piety is the root of Jen. » It can also be said that filial piety attains to its perfection in love for the human race.27 It is regrettable that Fr. Chin did not sufficiently elaborate on the fruitful approach which we have indicated here. 5. Before concluding our report on the importance which Chinese theology attributes to the concept of filial piety, we should dwell on several points which Fr. Kung Shih-rong has made with a pastoral perspective in mind. In his opinion, the fact that Christ calls God His Father is very close to the Chinese way of filial piety. However, modem theology in the West, under the influence of personalist philosophy, prefers to explain the relationship between God and man in terms of friendship. According to Fr. Kung, if this personalist viewpoint were in troduced in China, it would conflict with Chinese culture. He Chin Hsiang-kuei, The Difficulties in Explaining Filial Piety, Col lectanea Theologica, no. 21, ρ. 455, Nov. 1974. 27 Ibid.</page><page sequence="20">24 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. enumerates at least six reasons for this stance which are worth repeating here: 1) According to the five basic relations described in the Chinese tradition, the father-son relation and the relation between friends do not belong to the same category; 2) The object of filial piety is one's parents, whereas the object of friendship is one's fellow men; 3) To treat one's father as a friend indicates a lack of respect and politeness; 4) Filial piety is the basis of Chinese society; self-cultivation, family, educa tion, society and politics ali have filial piety as their source; 5) According to our social custom, one is not permitted to cali his father a friend; 6) Finally, at the end of the Ming Dynasty, when the Catholic missionaries carne to China, they promoted the virtue of filial piety and thus were welcomed by the Chinese people; but the « dispute of rites » led to the prohibition of pay ing honor to ancestors, and because of this the Church was regarded as barbarian. Therefore, even if Western culture does permit theologians to explain the relationship between God and man in terms of friendship, the very centrai practice of Jesus himself and the reasons given above are good grounds for not introducing this concept to the Chinese people. Therefore, one should avoid alluding to it both in writing and in preaching; and even when someone translates into Chinese a Western work in which God is called a friend, he must immediately add some clarification in order to avoid being ridiculed.28 In the past, I felt that Fr. Kung's position was quite extreme. But today, when I relate his ideas, I cannot but recognize that his views about pastoral work are quite right. This is a real problem which is most relevant to theological inculturation. II 1. In tradìtional Chinese culture, the concept which has been more studied by philosophers than filial piety is Jen. Theologians often compare it to the concept of love which is contained in the Holy Scriptures. There are very many articles by Confucianists on this topic, but they do not formulate theories that are evidently different from each other. Hence 28 Kung Shih-rong, A Discussioti about Kinship and Friendship, Vox Clerici, voi. 6, no. 12, pp. 17-22, Sept. 1968.</page><page sequence="21">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 25 it can be seen that the work of inculturation unfortunately consists in only a superficial comparison of the locai culture with the Christian faith. A more profound and harmonious union of the two concepts stili lies in the future. What then is the meaning of Jen? We can turn to the excellent article of a representative Catholic scholar, Archbishop Lo Kuang, for an introduction to the ideas contained in Jen? The ancient Chinese people called « the idea of action » the Way, and « the reason why things in themselves are such », the Principle. They are to be differentiated but not separated. Before the Ch'in and the Han Dynasties, when the Classics were interested in a philosophy of life, people talked more about the Way. But later, especially during the Sung and the Ming Dynasties, people spoke more about nature and reason, and therefore concentrated on the Principle. However, the Way of Heaven and the Principle of Heaven tended to be constantly associated and frequently interchanged. The Chinese philosophy of life always regards the imitation of Heaven as its supreme norm, and holds that the way of man must follow the Way of Heaven. It was in this context that the concept Jen originated. The Way of Heaven is the ground of the actions of Heaven, and the Principle of Heaven is the reason why Heaven is what it is. The ancient Chinese thought that « the Way of Heaven is the source of endless pro duction »; therefore, ali things that are produced by Heaven also ha ve « the source of endless production as their nature ». As far as things are concerned, the source of endless produc tion brings about their perfection naturally. But in man, and only in man, the source needs to be experienced and responded to. This is the starting-point of a philosophy of life. The con cept Jen means putting the Principle of Heaven, or the source of endless production, into practice. Thus Jen and the endless production are united in the realm of ethics. Jen is the realiza tion and completion of endless production. When men com municate, they should follow the proverb: « help others to estab lish what you want to establish for yourself, and make others know what you yourself want to know. » This is the summit of Jen and reveals the relationship between Jen and production. 29 Lo Kuang, The Principle of Endless Production, Collectanea Theolo gtea, no. 14, pp. 599-614. Dee. 1972.</page><page sequence="22">26 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. It follows logically that Jen induces people « to love men and to love things. » The love of things is also a manifestation of the source of endless production present in those who pos sess Jen. As a result, the idea that « ali things are one », first for mulated by the Neo-Confucianists, became popular. Originally, according to Chinese thought, the Mind of Heaven and Earth constituted the nature of ali things, and this nature is the source of endless production. The nature of ali things is the same, yet only man can experience the Mind of Heaven and earth as Jen and can communicate with ali things in the universe. Therefore, the Neo-Confucianists hold that Jen is itself communication because it allows men to search for com munion with ali things and to be one with them. ~ It is through Jen that men and things attain the Mind of Heaven and Earth which is their nature, and thus participate in the source of endless production. Ali existing things can communicate with and respond to each other, but only man can experience this communication, respond to it and thus participate in the crea tion of Heaven and Earth. This privilege is exercised, however, by those who possess Jen. 2. From this brief introduction to the meaning of Jen, it becomes more evident why Chinese theologians compare the Confucian concepì of Jen to Christian love. In the same article quoted above, Archbishop Lo Kuang systematically grounds this comparison: (1) According to the Confucianists, Jen comes from the Mind of Heaven and Earth which in turn is the Mind of God. In Catholic theology the nature of God is defined as love. (2) Confucianism considers Jen the realization of the source of endless production which is manifested in the con servation and development of life. The Church teaches that the Word of God has become incarnate so as to give man abundant life; this is the supreme manifestation of the God of love. (3) The very purpose of Jen is to allow mankind to participate in the creative work of Heaven and Earth and thus to expand the life of ali things. Through the love of Christ, the universe itself and mankind in particular take part in the new creation.</page><page sequence="23">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 27 3. In another article,30 Archbishop Lo Kuang further ana lyzes the similarity and the difference between Jen and Chris tian love. (1) Both of them come from God; both bestow life. Both of them empower the most important activities of human life and lead mankind to perfection. (2) The love of the Bible is revealed directly by God Himself and it grants man a super natural life. The Jen of Confucianism comes from God, but is manifested through the creative work of Heaven and Earth. The life it gives to man is simply a naturai life. Finally, both the Church and Confucianism regard Jen or love as the supreme commandment and as the highest good. Those who respond to the love of Christ are called saints, and those who have the Jen of Confucianism are called « men of Jen ». 4. Certainly Archbishop Lo Kuang has provided an exem plary treatment of Jen and of Christian love which is most help ful to the Chinese theologian. We could cite many other works on this topic, but, since their content is very similar, it is unnecessary to do so. Yet there is a question which can be raised here with regard to the relationship between the love of God and the love of man. If the Chinese Church exists in a culture which possesses such a thorough doctrine of Jen, why did it not think of explaining the theology and the practice of Christian love by employing this rich tradition? Ili 1. It is universally admitted that Chinese culture puts much stress on moral practice. But this is not to say that Chinese people lack the power to engagé in metaphysical speculation. Stili, their metaphysics is always aimed at a philosophy of life and is never purely abstract. This is perhaps the chief reason why Catholic theologians in the past have limited the scope of inculturation to the field of morality. In fact, Jen and filial piety are the hinges of the moral life of the Chinese people, since Chinese theology centered on these two concepts. Due to the saying of Confucius, « there is one thread that runs 30 Lo Kuang, The Love in the Bible and the Jen in Confucianism, Ibid., no. 27, pp. 7-15, March 1976.</page><page sequence="24">28 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. through my doctrines », that is, due to his inclination to stress the fundamentals, the Confucian tradition itself does not con centrate so much on details that it forgets its main objective. Thus, there is little discussion of other virtues. This fact doubt lessly influenced the works of Catholic theologians with the result that, in their early tentative writings, hardly any other themes were highlighted. 2. However, I did write an article of a quite different nature which is worth being noted here.31 After Vatican II theologians in general began to reflect on the history of salvation. Natural ly, a Chinese Catholic would also reflect on the salvation history of his own people. At that time I wrote: « In the history of salvation God has chosen the people of Israel to prepare the coming of Christ; at the same time He announced to them their way to salvation. This was, therefore, a relationship between « a people » and God. God revealed to the people of Israel the truths that were to be believed, the commandments that were to be observed, and the rites that were to be per formed through Moses. The Jewish people can be saved by accepting the revelation of Moses. This is the « social method » which God made available to them. Thus, we believe that, before the coming of the Gospel of Christ, God adopted similar social methods for man's salvation. For the sake of the Chinese people, He revealed to Confucius the supernatural way of salva tion which is propagated through him to the whole people. When, before the coming of the Gospel, a Chinese heard the « revealed truths » transmitted by Confucius through his « ear », and when he received the grace given by God in his heart, he could be restored to justice and be saved. The so-called « revealed truths » transmitted by Confucius should not make us slavishly look for a list of dogmas. These truths rather exist as a kind of spirit and practice inaugurated by Confucius. Although God has, speaking abstractly, many different methods by which He can save mankind, we think that in China He chose Confucius to transmit the way of salvation. Therefore, Confucius ... is the Moses of the Chinese Catholic Church... »32 31 Aloysius Chang, Art Explanation About Confucius (Confucius, Reve lation, Chinese History and Christ), Collectanea Theologica, no. 7, pp. 33 39, March 1971. κ Ibid., pp. 36-37.</page><page sequence="25">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 29 This paragraph sufficiently shows how I have envisioned the « salvation history » of the Chinese people and the centrality of Confucius' mediation in this history. Here I will not elaborate on how Confucius must have had such a mission both during his lifetime and in Chinese history, as seems clearly to be the case. From today's standpoint there are many details which should be further clarified, but I stili hold that this hypothesis can be defended. Relying on the above-mentioned hypothesis, I have also said: « The consequence of this thought is very great. Today the Catholic Church particularly emphasizes that we should respect the traditional cultures of native peoples... As regards the Chinese people, if the divine Word Himself had a « dialogue » with it earlier, we are sure that its history has in some way been sanctified by revelation. Therefore, in addition to the problem of adaptation in our mission work, we have to consider the link between the traditional thought of China and the Gospel... I hope it is not too rash to say that the classics of Confucius and of orthodox Confucianism are the « Old Testament » of the Chinese people. The Old Testament is the prefiguration of the New Testament. So our « Old Testa ment » should also contain a prefigurement of Christ... »33 3. Due to the fact that Chinese theologians do not like open ly to discuss new positions, my article was only occasionally mentioned. It was several years later, in a theological seminar, that it produced some waves. Yet, those who are acquainted with Indian theology, will find that they have a similar problem and that they also are engaged in discussions concerning the « inspiration » of the Indian religious classics. IV This sketch of the tentative beginnings of theological inculturation in the Chinese Church during the past twenty years has thus far relied mostly on articles published in a few magazines. There are, however, three books which, because of their specialized nature, deserve at least a brief description. 33 Ibid., ρ. 39.</page><page sequence="26">30 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. 1. The first book, « The Boundary between Heaven and Man » by Bishop Ch'eng Shih-kuang,34 is marked more by a pastoral than a scientific tone. It explains in everyday language the results of a profound study of Christian faith in relation to themes dealing with the meaning of life that are popular among the people. A Chinese reader who is familiar with the classics of his culture will clearly recognize that Bishop Ch'eng is influenced by the first few sentences of the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Meati: « The way of adult education consists in manifesting clear virtue, loving the people, and abiding in the highest good. » And « What Heaven imparts to man is called human nature. To follow our nature is called the Way. Cultivating the Way is called education. » Since Heaven is the source of ali things, it is the first topic discussed. Moral conscience is the concrete manifestation of Heaven in man's spiritual life. But in this world the moral conscience of man is easily obscured by sensual inclinations or passions. Therefore, it is necessary to dwell on « cultivation » as the means to develop the good elements of our spiritual nature. In order that our cultivation does not fall into subjectivism, « commandments » provide us with objective norms. Cultiva tion of virtues and observation of commandments cannot be achieved by human power alone; in order to become saints or sages, that is, in order to be able to abide in the highest good, it is necessary to have the assistance of Heaven — « grace ». The one who unites God and man in himself is « Christ ». The « sacraments » and « prayer » are methods by which we can obtain the grace of God. This brief overview is sufficient to indicate that the order which Bishop Ch'eng followed in stating Christian faith substantially departs from that used in Western theology and offers a new approach adapted to the Chinese way of thinking.35 The theological method of Bishop Ch'eng has already been touched on and need not be repeated here. 2. The second book, written by Fr. Li Shan-hsiou, is entitled « A Study of the Inculturation of the Catholic Church in China. »36 This work is composed of short notes based on the 34 See note 15 op. cit., ρ. 343. 35 Ibid., pp. 1-6. 36 Li Shan-hsiou, A Study of the Inculturation of the Catholic Church iti China. The Kuang Ch'i Press, first edition, p. 266.</page><page sequence="27">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 31 experiences of the author. They are intended for mission work, especially as a resource book for those who teach catechism; thus this work is not meant to be a scientific treatise. Like Bishop Ch'eng, Fr. Li thinks that the main character istic of Chinese thought is the close relationship between the way of Heaven and the way of man. The essential aim of inculturation of the Catholic Church in China is to attain an harmonious blending between Christianity and Chinese culture in order that they can supplement each other. One can use Chinese culture to bring Christianity to its fullness, so that the latter may take root and grow in the former. On the other hand, the insufficiency of Chinese culture can be enriched by Christianity's -gift of supernatural revelation. In this way, Chinese culture may obtain its sanctification, that is, be elevated to the supernatural level. Fr. Li makes it clear that inculturation does not mean expelling ali traces of Western culture; rather it envisions a new Chinese culture as its aim which will be the result of communication between China and the West.37 At the end of his book Fr. Li has put forth what we might cali the cultivation method of the Neo-Confucianists. Such themes as: « respect for virtuous character », « abiding in seriousness », « making interior observation », and « practicing recollection and cultivation » are suggested as the basis for a spirituality of the Chinese Church. This idea is rather stimulat ing, and in fact has attracted the attention of many theologians. This idea will be taken up a little later.38 3. The third book, entitled « Heaven and Man Belong to one Family », was written by Fr. Chao Pin-shih.39 The purpose of this work is to prove or confirm various Christian truths by means of the sayings of our ancient sages, so that the Chinese people will know that the doctrine and spirituality of the Catholic Church are also suitable for Chinese culture. Therefore this is « a theology which is a blend of science, Cath olic doctrine and Catholic spirituality. »40 Since this book also 3? Ibid., Preface, pp. 17-18. 38 Ibid.., ρ. 265. 39 Chao Pin-shih, Heaven and Man Belong to One Family, Heng Yi Monthly Press, Oct. 1977, first edition, p. 257. 40 Ibid., Preface, p. 6.</page><page sequence="28">32 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. broke with the traditional theology of the West and since it very much represents the spirit of Chinese theology at that time, it should be presented in more detail. In the first pari, « The Concepì of Heaven », corresponds to the traditional « Treatise on God »; it mainly discusses « The Supreme Divinity » and is divided into two chapters. The first of these explains the names which were attributed to the Supreme Divinity in the Oracle-Bone Scripture and various classics, and then comments on the word « Tien » (Heaven), in order to make the reader understand that Heaven in Chinese tradition is in fact the Root and Source of the universe. The second chapter also shows, by use of the same classics, that for ages the Chinese people have understood Heaven as a God possessing personality, intelligence and will. Fr. Chao also points out that in both the Confucian and the Taoist tradition Heaven was also recognized as an invisible Divinity a long time ago. These two traditions were and are co-existent in China. Then the author proves, by means of the recorded customs in the classics, that Heaven in the mind of the Chinese People and the God of revelation are one and the same Being. Finally Fr. Chao, employing different arguments, demonstrates that, on the one hand, the ancient people recognized Heaven as the Lord of the universe who possesses ali authority and governs ali things; on the other hand, they perceived intuitively that ali human beings belong to one great family and that Heaven is its Head, and thus the Father of ali mankind. The conclusion of the first part is that Heaven and the unique God as believed by the Church are identical.41 The second part makes use of the sacrificial rites to explain that the ancient people regarded Heaven as Father. The author says that the view of the Heavenly Father which the ancient Chinese inferred from ethics is different from that which was foreshadowed in the Old Testament and manifestly revealed in the New Testament. The ancient Chinese carne to regard Heaven as the Father of ali peoples through the rites in honor of ancestors; these rites were meant « to repay for the favour of his origin », « to show gratitude », and « to continue the acts of filial piety ». The sacrifices offered to Heaven indicate that they regard Heaven not only as the ultimate Root and Source 41 Ibid., pp. 1-49.</page><page sequence="29">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 33 but also as the last Ancestor. This action is a recognition that in man the divine life of Heaven is present. Since this life continues through the sacrificial rites, man can always be with God. This is the so-called ethical view of the Heavenly Father. Of course, its content is stili very obscure and needs to be expanded and clarified by revelation. This part of Fr. Chao's book also investigates the imperiai sacrifice held in the country side. Since this matter is very complex and not immediately relevant, we shall not speak of it in this place.42 The third part considers the relationship between Heaven and man. It is shown that the Confucian tenet that « ali men under Heaven belong to one family » and the thought of Christ agree with each other, although they are independent. The idea that « ali men of the four seas are brothers » is deeply engrained in the minds of the Chinese people. Furthermore, the ancient tradition recorded in the Chinese classics is in accord with the content of Genesis. Both of them involve patriarchies which lay stress on the importance of family, and thence carne the religious view that Heaven is Father. Accord ing to the ancient Chinese people, man was to honor Heaven, to serve Heaven, to imitate Heaven, and to be united with Heaven. Thus the Confucianists hold that Jen, sincerity and harmony are the way of union since these practices unite the mind of man to the Mind of Heaven. Because the way of Heaven is most sincere, man must therefore realize his nature by being sincere. In this way he can participate in the creative work of Heaven and Earth, and, with Heaven and Earth, con stitute a trinity. This is the final state of harmony. As regards the rest of this part, since it speaks of originai sin and other doctrines of faith, using the Bible as its basis, and only occasion ally introduces some Chinese thoughts, we do not intend to treat it here.43 The fourth part deals with Christ and salvation. Here we can only mention some concepts that touch on inculturation in China. Fr. Chao compares the way of the new commandment of Jesus with the way of conscientiousness and altruism of the Confucianists, and he regards the hypocrite in the countryside at the time of Confucius as the pseudo-prophet. The idea that attracts our attention the most is that « the new man » 42 Ibid., pp. 5-63.</page><page sequence="30">34 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. of the kingdom of God is explained in terms of the way of the Great Learning. Central is the idea that « the new man » which is spoken of by St. Paul is « the new people » of the Con fucianists. A member of the new people manifests clear virtue and obtains his self-realization by abiding in the highest good. He who manifests clear virtue is the one Mencius called the « Sir of Heaven »: he enriches and expands the vir tues of Jen, justice, sincerity and faithfulness, and thus be comes the man of Jen who, by « wishing to establish his own virtue, also establishes the virtue of others. And wishing to be prominent himself, also helps others to be prominent. He is able to judge others by what is near to ourselves. » This is the state of the « New man » of Christ who loves his neighbor as himself. What we have mentioned here are the more promi nent thoughts of the fourth part. The rest of it is concerned with the miracles of Jesus which the author unfortunately did not link with the thought of traditional Chinese theology.44 The reason why we have made such a lengthy summary of this book is that it very much represents the main tendency of the efforts to inculturate Chinese theology in the past. Its method is to explain the faith of the Church by means of the Chinese classics. There are two points to be considered. First, although it is trae that these classics belong to Chinese culture, how much do they stili influence contemporary thought? This question has to be discussed. Second, even if we can use Chinese classics in explaining the faith of the Church, a con sistently criticai spirit is indispensable. Not only should we be criticai in using Chinese classics, but also we should be aware of the contemporary criticism of the Bible. Fr. Chao did not show that he is informed in this regard, at least on the surface.45 In our opinion, both the scholars who study Chinese thought and the scholars who study the Bible of the Church would not fully agree with his method or conclusions. « Ibid., pp. 64-102. « Ibid., pp. 103-257. 43 See Tu Er-wei, The Book 'Heaven and Man Belong to One Family' is Rather a Work in the Moralist Style, Heng Yi Monthly, voi. 28, pp, 18-19, March 1979.</page><page sequence="31">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 35 V We have presented a survey of the work done on incultura tion by Catholic theologians during the past twenty years. We have stressed explicit works on this topic. However, before concluding this part of our presentation it is worth noting that there are other materials which, at least indirectly, are very helpful for inculturation. For instance, there are reference works in translation which have great importance: The Dic tionary of the Bible, the Dictionary of Biblical Theology, Selec tions of Latin and Greek Church Fathers, Selections of the Teaching Documents of the Catholic Church... etc., and intro ductions to contemporary Western theology (in this respect Collectanea Theologica Universitatis Fu Jen and the seminars organized by the Faculty of theology of Fu Jen Catholic Uni versity made great contributions). Ali these efforts impercep tibly increased the interest of the locai Church in theology. We must therefore say that these also belong to the work of theological inculturation. But in this first part, which reviews the methods and the results of Chinese theological inculturation in its early stage, we immediately discover that there is no dose relationship between these two elements. Very often those who discuss method did not write theological works, and those who devel oped Chinese theology did not pay much attention to method. Therefore, methodology has remained abstract and barren, and the theological works have not fully satisfied the demands of science. Can this dichotomy be corrected? Let us turn to the next phase of the development. II. The Present State of Theological Inculturation of the Chinese Church « The present » indicates the period from 1976 up to the writing of this article, that is, only a span of four years. How ever, we think that this period is most important since during it the work of theological inculturation advanced to a new stage.</page><page sequence="32">36 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. I 1. The year 1976 surely has symbolic significance for the Chinese Church. For in that year it was clearly affirmed that the Church in China would move from the stage of imitation to that of adaptation. The Study and Planning Committee of the Secretariate of Chinese Bishops' Conference issued the document: « A Draft Pian for Building Up the Chinese Locai Church »46 which began with the words: « When the Christian faith is propagated in a particular place, it usually must pass through two stages: that of imitation and that of adaptation. To go from the one to the other is clearly a sign of the graduai maturity of the locai Church. The so-called adaptation is the inculturation of the Church which we frequently hear talked about today. This is the most fundamental and important phase in the work of building up the locai Church. »47 2. As a matter of fact, imitation and adaptation cannot be neatly distinguished. Before 1976, in many respects the Chinese Church not only imitated the Western Church, but also init iated some adaptations. But in view of the public nature which the Bishops' Conference enjoys, the year 1976 is to a certain extent a line of demarcation . We will quote another passage from the draft pian which forcefully demonstrates the new consciousness of the Chinese Church: « In the modem era there were quite a few missionaries engaged in the task of inculturation, the more famous among them being Matthew Ricci and Robert Di Nobili... But in the course of history, due to human errors on the part of some, the whole Church neglected this task for a long time. Then, at Vatican II, the wind of the Holy Spirit blew away these dark clouds and the need for inculturation was once more considered important. This work, under the further impetus of the universal Synod of Bishops in 1974, began everywhere in the Church. During this period the Chinese Church, growing stronger day by day, emerged from the stage of imitation and existentially felt the need for adaptation. The time of the divine salvation of Chinese 46 Published by The Association for the Promotion of Catholic Affairs, p. 36, Jan. 1976, first edition. « Ibid., p. 1.</page><page sequence="33">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 37 culture had arrived, and both Chinese and foreign priests, who had the same heart as Christ, deeply felt that the incultura tion of the Chinese Church had become their most urgent task And then, with full trust in the divine pian of salvation, 'The Draft Pian for Building Up the Chinese Locai Church' carne into being. »48 As the Draft Pian says, building up the Chinese locai Church is identical with the inculturation of the Church. Concretely, the Draft Pian demands that ali Catholics actively participate in this undertaking so that Christian faith may be authentically expressed and lived, developed and transmitted through the locai language and literature, and in consonance with the tradi tional spirit and concepts of indigenous religion. In this way « the Catholic faith will be able to be incarnated and to take root in the culture and life of the native people. »49 3. The Draft Pian also mentions the problem of fostering the inculturation of theology and calls special attention to the need harmoniously to blend the Gospels with the humanistic spirit of Chinese tradition. Such a theology can also contribute to the theological development of the whole Church. « Every body knows that theological reflection is important to building up the native Churches. The formulation of a locai theology is not only very helpful in directing the life and actions of the native Church and in solving the various difficulties and prob lems that face it, but also very useful and influential for the theological development of the whole Church, especially of the Asian Churches. »50 It is not that the bishops were or are unfamiliar with the efforts which Chinese theologians have made for many years in the fìeld of adaptation. But, in their fervor for advancing the movement of inculturation, bishops naturally want theologians to continue to open up new directions. II 1. According to the Draft Pian, « the Catholic faith is to be incarnated and take root in the culture and life of the « Ibid., pp. 1-2. 49 Ibid., p. 16. 50 Ibid., p. 28.</page><page sequence="34">38 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. native people ». What, then, is the meaning of culture? Many people immediately answer that Chinese culture is the totality of thoughts and customs transmitted from ancient times. Such a response causes great suspicion not only among young per sons but also among many who appreciate modem China. Into which culture, then, is the Church to be incarnated? This question demands a clarification on the part of theologians engaged in the work of inculturation. At that time I made some attempts at such clarity.51 2. Culture is a structured way in which a social com munity lives, and it is formed by the experience and learning of that community. It has two aspects: form and matter. Its matter is made up of the fundamental human needs of the culture. These needs may be further divided into « individuai needs », that is, the physical, psychological and spiritual needs of the individuai; and « the needs of the community », that is, the familial, interrelational and organizational needs of the entire group. Besides, there is the « need for integration », that is, the individuai personality seeks wholeness and the community desires harmony. Generally speaking, the need for integration is satisfied by the arts, morality and religion. What we have said above concerns the matter of a culture. Any kind of culture, Eastern or Western, invariably has such needs.52 The form of a culture is the pattern of thought which originates from naturai and historical circumstances. Due to the variety of climates, to the difference between agricultural and industriai societies, and to the peculiarities of Eastern and Western modes of thought, there arises a particular pat tern of thinking in each culture. This we cali its form. Since circumstances, psychology, traditions and various other ele ments differ substantially, the forms of cultures are accordingly different. A concrete culture is formed by the union of body and spirit, form and matter. When the form of a culture, its 51 Aloysius Chang, The Basic Problem of Inculturating the Chtirch, Collectanea Theologica, no. 33, pp. 347-361, Oct. 1977. 32 Ibid., pp. 348-349.</page><page sequence="35">THE INCU LTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 39 pattern of thought, enters into the body of a culture, the fun damental human needs mentioned above will be fulfilled to a certain extent. Generally speaking, the culture of a normal society always manifeste continuity. But this does not mean that it is unalterable; in many circumstances it may change. The factors which cause a culture to evolve are numerous. For instance, under the impetus of the changing current of the times, the cultural pattern of thought will change; when a special personality appears, he may bring with him a new vision of society. In such cases, the culture in question would undergo either graduai corrections or even a drastic revolution. According to what we have said above, when we talk about the inculturation of the Church or of theology, the culture in question is not the fìxed culture of a certain historical stage; it is the contemporary culture. The spirit of Chinese culture is not the thought pattern contained in the ancient classics; it is the thought of the contemporary Chinese people. Of course the culture of today is stili influenced by the ancient tradition. This fact is not to be neglected.53 3. The inculturation of the Church is not a simple con cepì, either. This, of course, is due to the very characteristics of the Church. It is commonly said that the Church, in view of its source, is a community that transcends culture; it is not a product of any particular culture. On the other hand, the Church is always immanent in a certain culture; there has never been a Church which was not so determined. There fore in the process by which the Church was brought to the various cultures in the West or when it was extended to the East, it showed a very delicate attitude towards the new native cultures it encountered. That the Church, when facing a new culture, has to view its assimilation by the latter as an indis pensable aspect of its mission every ecclesiologist today knows quite well. Otherwise, the Church can be accused of cultural colonization. However, due to its special nature the Church cannot be totally identified with any culture; it must preserve its own special nature and at the same time be incarnated in the given culture; sometimes it must purify, transform and elevate its new environment. The most successful propagation 53 Ibid., pp. 349-350.</page><page sequence="36">40 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. of the Gospel takes place when the spirit of native cultures is influenced by the Church and begins to adopt a new face.54 The task of inculturating the Church in China involves on the one hand, aiding the Church which carries with it Western attitudes to be assimilated into Chinese culture and, on the other hand, allowing the Gospel of Christ to influence culture. The development of Chinese theology is a centrai part of this total process. Has an indigenous Chinese theology made any progress since 1976? Ili 1. Under the encouragement of the Bishops' Conference, those engaged in theological work showed themselves quite active. In 1976 the theology department of Fu Jen University adopted « the building up of the locai Church » as the main theme of a seminar held that year. Many people who were specialized in theology have been publishing creative works continuously. The laCk of a criticai spirit which we mentioned above seems to have lessened. For example, an article written by Fr. Fang Chih-rong in the same year55 shows that the author is more discerning. His intent is to draw a.« comparison be tween the Heaven of Confucianism and the God of the Bible. » But since he himself is not an expert in Confucianism, he relies on the studies made by Archbishop Lo Kuang who is quite learned in this area. With regard to the Biblical aspect, since he himself is a professor of Scripture, he provides a solid and accurate basis for his judgments. It is evident from the follow ing summary that Fr. Fang Chih-rong has considerably advanced the thought of those who preceded him. 2. The Heaven of Confucianism is very lofty. Other ancient cultures, such as the Egyptian, the Babylonian and the Assyrian, confused the world of God with that of human imagination; the more they said concerning the divine, the more they lost sight of its true nature. However, the Chinese culture, which has Confucianism as its orthodox tradition, did not say much μ Ibid., pp. 352-357. 55 Famg Chih-rong, A Comparison between the Heaven of Confucianism and the God of the Bible, Collectanea Theologica, no. 31, pp. 15-40, Aprii 1977.</page><page sequence="37">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 41 about God. Yet ali the references to Heaven in the ancient books are fitting and relevant; and manifest the discerning quality of Chinese Wisdom. This did not happen by chance. It was a wisdom attained through a conscious procedure which was in accord with the high spiritual aim of Confucius: « To say what you know when you do know and not to say what you do not know when you do not know — this is knowledge. » 3. The God who is revealed in the Bible is a Savior because He is a communicative Creator who enters into the history of man in an unexpected way. Ali the books of the Old Testament offer a description of the process of communication which takes place between God and man. What God hates are the sins of the world and the infidelity of man. But God Himself is always faithful and merciful towards His creatures. Indeed he is not over-lenient toward the sins of man, but it is evident that He maintains a close relationship with man. The God of the Bible has a surprising characteristic: He is on the side of the weak and small. God does not care much about the quantity of sacrifices offered to Him. But if injustice is perpetrated against infants, widows, foreigners or poor men, God hears their demand and immediately stands on their side. 4. The union between God and man is the centrai truth revealed in the New Testament. God is a loving Father. Be cause of His love for the world He sends His only Son as the elder Brother of mankind in order that He may reveal to men the goodness of the heavenly Father. This elder brother is Jesus Christ whose authoritative words and personal example constitute a self-revelation of the Father. This is very simi lar to the teaching of Confucius whose words and examples provide a paragon for ali generations. The difference is that Jesus, in addition to speaking and acting wisely, sacrificed Himself for mankind; after His death He rose again and became the fountain of new life for ali men. Jesus' beloved disciple, John, understood most clearly and most profoundly the dimensions of this new life: being and acting out of love in Jesus' name. Therefore in his Gospel and Letters, the new life and the new commandment cannot be separated. The way of union between God and man consists in love of God and love of man. These are not two loves, but two aspects of one love.</page><page sequence="38">42 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. 5. The union between Heaven and man embodies the essence of the Chinese cultural tradition and describes the purpose of life which is pursued by every philosophical school. In com paring Chinese culture with that of the Bible, one finds that they are two spiritual currents, each of which followed its own course for several thousand years without merging into one stream. Ali Western cultures have a spiritual affinity with the Bible. The classics, the history, the philosophy and the col lections of essays so important in Chinese culture can be rightly compared to « the Laws », « the Prophets », and « the Books » of the Bible. When Chinese culture encounters the Bible, it is like the meeting of relatives who have been separated for a long time and who now feel very close to each other. The union between God and man is also the reality proclaimed the Bible. The Chinese ideal is fulfilled because Jesus himself has already realized it. « Every man can be Yao and Shun » means « Every man can be Christ. » 6. The Heaven of Confucianism and the God of the Bible are therefore not contradictory. Rather they can be synchroniz ed one with the other. The intense contact between China and the West has been going on for more than one hundred years. In science, technology, and lifestyle they have complemented each other. Only with regard to the spiritual life are they stili isolated. If the Chinese people, who base their faith on Heaven, were to believe in the God of the Bible and accept Jesus Christ as sent by God, then not only will the Chinese people be more happy and Chinese culture flourish much more, but the whole human race will also be more united.56 IV 1. We have mentioned that Fr. Fang's article is much more advanced in its use of criticai thinking. But with regard to the subject matter he treats and to the method he employs, he did not contribute anything substantially new. However, in an earlier article57 he touched on the method to be adopted when 56 Ibid., pp. 38-39. 57 Fang Chih-rong, A Tentative Explanation of the Imitation of Heaven</page><page sequence="39">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 43 commenting on the Bible with a view to theological incultura tion. At this point we will briefly summarize his suggestion and also consider other methods advocated by those who are engaged in the field of Chinese theology at the present time. Fr. Fang's article attempts to explain the « imitation of God » in Matthew's Gospel in terms of the « Diagram of Heaven » in the Book of Changes; at the same time he points out some methodological elements that are native to Chinese theology. With regard to the style of writing, the form of reasoning and the manner of illustrating theological truth, the Bible and the Book of Changes can be readily compared and shown to be very dose to each other. For example, having explained how in Mt. 5,4548 Jesus makes use of naturai phenomena such as the sun shining on the good and on the bad, the rain falling on the same so as to point out the mani festations of the heavenly Father's love, Fr. Fang observes that in Western Biblical commentaries it is rather rare to find the imitation of God linked to naturai phenomena.58 Yet, this is the fundamental rule of the imitation of Heaven in the « Diagram of Heaven »; « our classics contain a very detailed observation and explanation of nature and man; they can greatly help us to understand this created world and the autonomy possessed by man. »59 One can then not help but ask: suppose the Chinese classics have such qualities, what contribution do they make to providing a tool of Biblical commentary for our theo logical inculturation? An answer was not clearly indicated in this article. In the « Seminar on Chinese Theology » held in Hong Kong in February 1979, however, Fr. Fang did address the issue as follows: « The science of Biblical commentary has its place in Chinese theology, because every theology must have the Bible as its basis. Biblical exegesis today holds that tradition and creation, theory and practice are complementary one with the other. It makes both the Chinese classics and the present con dition important; it demands that the rich literature.and culture of China and the literature of the Bible be explained and illumined reciprocally... Besides, the Western distinction be in Matthew's Gospel by Means of the Diagram of Heaven in the Book of Changes, Collectanea Theologica, no. 29, pp. 329-346, Sept. 1976. 5« Ibid., p. 338. 59 Ibid., p. 344.</page><page sequence="40">44 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. tween the naturai and the supernatural in its Biblical com mentary, which rests on such a theory of knowledge, should be amended and corrected. The characteristics of Chinese com mentary on the classics can be helpful in this process: (1) it has moral practice as its basis; (2) it does not simply use logie but lends life a direction; (3) it lets the reader take into account his subjective experience and opinion. »60 This, in fact, is an excellent starting point which could make a significant contribu tion to the method employed in Biblical exegesis. However, method is not an end in itself; method is to be used to explain the Bible, that is, to interpret divine self-revelation for the Christian community. Therefore, in my opinion, the ultimate question is how we are to provide a Biblical commentary for the Chinese Church which is faithful both to the data of revela tion and to the culture of China. This is the result to be expect ed in the future. 3. The method to be adopted in theological inculturation was the subject I took up in an article.61 Among contemporary Chinese philosophers, professor Fang Tung-mei is an outstand ing figure. Though he maintains a quite serious misunderstand ing about « the theory of personal God » of the Catholic Church, he does see that the fundamental ways in which Chinese culture expresses the relationship between Heaven and man are « union », « continuity » and « oneness ». He says that the pro ductive virtue of Heaven flows out in the form of myriad things and becomes the universe. Man stands in the universe, in harmony with Heaven and Earth, responsive to every other being, in tune with ali things, existing in one and the same flowing current with other human beings. This he calls the unity of the relationship between Heaven and man.62 It is undeniable that the fundamental category which expres ses the relationship between God and man, both in the Bible and in our theology, is the person-to-person relationship. It originates from the fundamental experience of communication #&gt; Report on the Study Meeting for Chinese Theology, published by Kung Kao Po, Hong Kong. March 2, 1979, ρ. 6. « Aloysius Chang, A Supplement to the Category of Personality — A Discussion of the Foundations of Chinese Theology, Collectanea Theolo gica, no. 32, pp. 313-331, July 1978. « Ibid., p. 314.</page><page sequence="41">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 45 among men, but, as used and interpreted by contemporary the ology and philosophy, it has made people become aware of the depth that is contained in the human person. In mutuai know ledge and love, persons can attain to the union between I and Thou. The Old Testament relates how God enters into human history in an interpersonal way, and it makes man understand that he is a child, a friend, even a lover of God. But ali human categories have their limitations. Even though theologians try hard to purify them and to correct their defects, the fact that human language about God must make use of the category of personality can never be totally eliminated. In the anthro pomorphic descriptions of the Old Testament, the all-perfect God converses with man. This already makes many Chinese people feel uneasy. Furthermore, due to the distinction be tween persons, that is, due to the limits between « I » and « Thou », the personal God can hardly be thought of as penetrat ing the universe and participating in the same flowing current with ali things. Yet a fundamental tenet of Chinese culture is that the universe is the totality of life and ali things are one in Jen; this cannot be easily expressed in the category of personality. How can we express that the productive virtue which is present ali throughout the universe is the infinite power of God? How can we present God as the source of the unity of the whole universe? How can we make clear that God is the basis of ali things?63 To do so, we are urged to make some adaptation as follows: in China the communication between Heaven and man is often · explained on three levels. The first is the level of experience which, though the most fundamental, is not easily expressed. Then there is the sym bolic level to which the so-called category of personality and category of unity must belong. Finally there is the systematic or theoretical level. By explaining the Old Testament's convic tion concerning God's personality in terms of symbol, I have attempted to join the theological category of personality to that of unity. Does this not come dose to the fundamental way by which Chinese culture expresses the relationship be tween Heaven and man? Is this not an example of theological inculturation in China? Furthermore, the Bible, in addition to the category of 63 Ibid., pp. 321-322.</page><page sequence="42">46 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. personality, also employs the category of unity. For example: « For it is God who works in you, makes you will, and makes you act, in order to accomplish His good will.» (Phil. 2:13); « In fact He is not far from us, because we live, act and exist in Him » {Acts 17:27-28). There are also some religious truths in the Bible which are recognized and exalted in the Chinese classics. For example, in Gen. 1:27-31, where various funda mental problems of man are discussed, their content is nearly the same as that in the following quotation: « If they can fully develop their nature, they can then fully develop the nature of others. If they can fully develop the nature of others, they can then fully develop the nature of things. If they can fully develop the nature of things, they can then assist in the transforming and nourishing process of Heaven and Earth. If they can assist in the transforming and nourishing process of Heaven and Earth, they can thus form a trinity with Heaven and Earth » (the « Doctrine of the Mean »). Now, the two passages mentioned here refer to the same fundamental experi ence of man: the divine power goes through the heart of man; if he develops this power, he can then be in tune with ali things, be responsive to ali man, and be in harmony with Heaven and Earth. The « Doctrine of the Mean » expresses this in terms of the category of unity, whereas Genesis expresses it in terms of the category of personality.64 If those who live within the cultural milieu of the « Doctrine of the Mean » are not accustomed to the category of personality, which appears to be an over-emphasized anthropomorphism, why then does the Church not sometimes use the category of unity to explain the God of revelation to them? In order to come closer to those who prefer to use the category of unity in referring to the relationship between Heaven and man, I have also tried to give a different explana tion of the Christian sacramente.65 Both traditional and con temporary theology in the West greatly rely on the category of personality. The sacraments are seen as interpersonal Com munications between Jesus Christ or between God the Father and the recipient. The salvation brought about by the sacra ments is understood to be gained by the individuai believer. « Ibid., pp. 318-319. ω Ibid., pp. 327-329.</page><page sequence="43">THE INCULTORATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 47 Yet since Vatican II this individualistic approach, which rests on the category of personality, has already been somewhat sur passed. For example, the dynamic action of Christ in the sacra ments and the lively participation of the recipient allow the sacramentai encounter to be viewed as an « I — Thou » com munication between one person and another; thus recent sacra mentai theology has became more dialogical. If the Chinese theologian is not totally satisfied with these developments, it is because Western theology has not yet overcome its individual ism. Although in theory much attention has been devoted to the communitarian aspect of the sacramente, in fact the Chris tian community, apart from the ministers and the recipients, is not seen to participate in the sacramente. The community seems instead to play the role of passive onlookers. Can the category of unity serve to complement Western sacramentai theology? This category would not focus on the ministers and the receivers but on the community of the Church. In liturgical actions each one of the faithful has a part to play; ali the faithful perform the ritual act together and lend to the symbolic event a communitarian dimension. The whole community, which is constituted as one by the Holy Spirit, « commemorates » or « celebrates » an aspect of the life of Jesus through the symbolic actions which are the sacramente. The latter are not primarily Communications between one person and another. But the life of Christ, which is the basis of the community of the Church, manifests itself in the community and flows from it. If it is asked, who « receives » the sacra mente, we should say that the Church, as the united entity which administers them, also « receives » them. This does not deny that the role of various community members is different and therefore that the saving experience, that is, « the sacra mentai grace » of each one, is also different. But everybody « receives » the sacraments. In this way the corporate nature of the sacraments is made clearer, the roles of the recipients and of the minister are given new dimensions, and the union between Christ and the entire Church is seen to be more in timate. What then does a Chinese Christian experience in the sacraments? He experiences that God is in harmony with him through Christ, that he is responsive to others in Christ, and that he is united to ali things in Christ. The union of Heaven</page><page sequence="44">48 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. and man which is always sought after with longing by the Chinese heart is now experienced in the sacraments. May this perhaps be called Chinese theology? In recent years, people from the West carne to the East in droves in order to look for some inspiration in its ancient religious traditions. At the same time Orientai Christians, especially Catholics involved in dialogue with indigenous re ligions, not only discovered many treasures there for growth in spirituality but also assimilated them. Does the Chinese religious culture with its long history have a special contribu tion to make to spirituality? Have Catholic Chinese theologians attempted to learn from this spirituality? Fr. Sung Chih-ch'ing, in an article, entitled, « Prayer and the Search for Truth by Meditation — A Study on the Christian Prayer and the Chinese Zen, »66 pointed out the differences between the two, and at the same time indicated that Christian prayer may assimilate the elements of the Chinese Zen. Yet Fr. Sung also manifests the cautions attitude which, generally speaking, reflects the Chinese Church's not wholly enthusiastic acceptance of « Chris tian Zen ». There is indeed a metaphysical dimension in Zen which « intends to discover the truth of human nature... It makes man understand that he should not be tied down by anything external or internai and thus that he should free himself from worldly worries. It holds that the existence of gods, of divine laws and of the supernatural are ali obstacles which man fashioned for himself. He should first get rid of them so that he can then see the most luminous world. »67 It is immediately evident that this doctrine is very far from the interpersonal meeting between God and man claimed by Christian prayer. However, with regard to spiritual methods, Zen and Christian prayer have much in common. For example, three concrete practices of Zen, namely, isolation, sitting in meditation, and reading the Buddhist texts, though they cannot be substituted 66 Sung Chih-ch'ing, Prayer and Sitting in Meditation, Witness Month ly, voi. 8, no. 9, pp. 4-20, June 1978. « Ibid., p, 6.</page><page sequence="45">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 49 for Christian prayer, can properly be regarded as methods: « In other words, these methods can be used as preparations for meditation or contemplation: to lead the mind to silence and stillness in order to be united with God. »68 Thus, Orientai spirituality's stress on quietness has much to recommend for itself and should be more seriously promoted and put into practice in the West, so as to counteract the latter's excessive emphasis on words and procedures. Finally, Fr. Sung also make a comparison between the enlightenment advocated by the School of Zen and the awaken ing to the truth of Jesus Christ that marked the history of the Christian Church. The latter attained to a mystical level which is different in many respects from that achieved by the sud den enlightenment of Zen.69 Although some theologians have discussed the « mystical life » of the pagans, this was not the aim of Fr. Sung. In a word, besides advocating the adoption of various methods, such as « sitting in meditation » he has indeed clarified several points, which in itself is extremely important for the work of inculturation, but most of ali has suggested caution. As we mentioned earlier, the Chinese Church should proceed carefully and preserve its own faith. In this respect, Fr. Fang Chih-rong manifests a similar attitude. In an article70 in which he analyzes the methods employed in Zen meditation and in Western contemplation, he observes: « 1) The world needs the ancient experience of the Indian religion and of the Chinese people about Heaven. This experience reveals that God is in nature, at the depth of ali beings and at the core of the human soul. 2) The world needs the experience of the Hebrews which gives witness to the transcendent Yahweh who cannot be reached by human thought and imagination, but who nevertheless guides and loves man. 3) The world needs the zeal of searching for wisdom which is found in Buddhism, because wisdom brings freedom and salva tion to man by means of enlightenment. 4) The world should not disregard the revelation of Jesus Christ, because He em bodies in himself the two dimensions of God, transcendence and immanence, and He unveils many things about God, which « Ibid., ρ. 13. » Ibid., ρ. 20. 70 The Contemplation in the Bible and the Orientai Sitting in Medita tion, Collectanea Theologica, no. 37, pp. 377-392. Oct. 1978.</page><page sequence="46">50 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. were never heard before. 5) The world also needs the diligence and alertness of the scientists who ceaselessly search for truth, lend impetus to the progress of mankind, and improve human life. »71 Thus, Fr. Fang encourages every religion and culture to be loyal to its own history and tradition. They can maintain harmony and enter into dialogue with each other without com promising their heritage. The encounter of different religions, especially of those who practice mysticism, will make clear that they can mutually benefit each other, and since they head towards a common future, they share a common view point and a common hope. Of course, these insights are only indirectly related to the work of theological and spiritual in cultura tion.72 The centrai question remains: how can Christian spiritual ity, which is based on faith, be incarnated or engrafted into Chinese culture? One of my books entitled « My Humble View on Chinese Spirituality », attempts to give a preliminary answer to this question.73 Its purpose is to outline an authentic way towards spiritual growth for the Chinese Church. Such a way would differ both from the tradition of the Western Church and from the « Christian Zen » proposed by theologians who were engaged in the inculturation of the Church in Japan. The way which I propose can be compared with these other two methods so as to bring its characteristics to light.74 Colloquiai prayer is the most fundamental type of spiritual ity advocated both in the Bible and in the tradition of the Western Church. In colloquiai prayer, God and man talk with each other. God speaks, demands, reveals, and man listens, answers, recognizes. This colloquiai form of prayer expresses the personal relationship between God and man. Yet it in volves some anthropomorphic elements which very often can cause antipathy in those who have noble and awesome religious sentiments. Nevertheless, with regard to the colloquiai prayer itself, it is unquestionable that it stirs devotion, because, in facing the God who loves man so deeply and forgives him so 71 Ibid., ρ. 389. 72 Ibid., pp. 390-391. 72 Aloysius Chang, My Humble View oti Chitiese Spirituality, Kuang Ch'i Press, Dee. 1978, first edition, ρ. 182. 74 Ibid., pp. 3-8.</page><page sequence="47">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 51 completely, one's will is spontaneously drawn to return love. Thus the person who practices such prayer will make every effort to enhance his spiritual growth in order to accomplish the will of God. A serious problem with colloquiai prayer, however, is that the will of God comes to the person from the outside, and therefore seems to be extraneous to him. As a consequence, although outwardly he is very active (because he goes out, forges ahead), and although he achieves laudable external results, he remains inwardly empty and unreflective; inside he is stili unclear, confused and lonely. Thus his spirituality does not foster a transparent and lasting understanding of the God who is the source of his actions. What an observer senses are heroic external actions aimed at overcoming obstacles in spiritual growth and perfection. What the saints and other holy people of the Western Church — those who adopted the spirituality of colloquiai prayer — cause us to admire are their high meritorious achievements and ascetical practices, but they rarely left a detailed description of their internai state of being. The reason is that their ideal of spirituality is to attune them selves to the will of God that comes to them from outside, and their attention is concentrated on realizing that will. The approach which I have taken in « My Humble View on Chinese Spirituality », may be called « the restoration of human nature » in Christian consciousness. This is a spirituality that incorporates insights rnto human interiority prevalent from the time of Confucius and Mencius up to that of Neo-Confucianism. The mandate or will of Heaven is called nature. This means that where there is the creative work of Heaven, there is also the mandate. This is especially trae in the case of man, whose nature signifies transcendence and value. The efforts towards restoring nature in the Chinese tradition are aimed at making the light of Heaven shine out through one's moral life. The Confucian « realization of Jen » is but the realization of the productive virtue of Heaven. Through this realization, human virtue becomes identical with that of Heaven and Earth, and moral radiance with that of the sun and the moon. According to the words of Mencius, « if one fully develops his mind, he knows his nature; if he knows his nature, he knows Heaven. » This effort to restore man to his trae nature became much</page><page sequence="48">52 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. more important in Neo-Confucianism. This fact has been pointed out in an article by Father Hu Kuo-chen.75 The restoration of nature is sometimes referred to as « quiet sitting » by the Neo-Confucianists. Although the external gesture should not be considered insignificant, the more important thing is to comprehend the irrational or antirational elements and the ontologica! reality of nature {the mandate of Heaven) in the life of the individuai. Therefore, from one point of view, the goal of quiet sitting is to observe internai movements and to gaze behind the veil that conceals nature; from another point of view, it is aimed at allowing nature, which is the mandate of Heaven, sufficiently to manifest itself. The spirituality of Chinese Christians could be understood as oriented to restoring nature and to putting faith into practice. This may be called the particular way in which « quiet sitting » is observed by Chinese Christians. In order to explain this briefly, it is helpful to compare this approach with the spiritual ity of the Western Church mentioned above. Since quiet sitting falls under the category of unity, God is not viewed as being in personal opposition to man, but as within him. God is Love and Life which flow into the heart of man so that he can share in the supernatural. This intimate participation in the life of God is the essence of Christian faith. In this light, the will of God is not perceived as coming from outside man as is the case in the spirituality on which colloquiai prayer is based. On the contrary, the will of God is found within the life of the believer. By adopting the way of quiet sitting, the whole of Christian spiritual life can be expressed in terms of many ancient sayings, such as the following passage from the Great Learning: « ... Those who wish to rectify their minds, would first make their wills sincere. Those who wish to make their wills sincere, would first expand their knowledge. The expan sion of knowledge consists in the investigation of things... » The method called quiet sitting begins with the investigation of things; for Christians this may be regarded as the exact knowledge of the Bible or of the will of God as revealed by Jesus and His Spirit. When things are investigated, knowledge is extended. The so-called extension of knowledge is the prò 75 Hu Kuo-CHEN, The 'Sitting in Meditatiori of Chinese Christians, Col lectanea Theologica, no. 37, pp. 333-375. Oct. 1978.</page><page sequence="49">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 53 found conviction of Christians that the Words of God, the Love and the Life of God are present to the mind, and the sincerity of the will that follows is the effort of the Christian to eliminate elements in his life which are not conducive to faith and to realize in a conscious way the Love, the Life and the Will of God. Such a Chinese Christian spirituality rests on the grace of baptism by which the Life of God enters within the believer. This spirituality is directed towards keeping the (supernatural) nature of grace alive. The « restoration » of graced human nature arises from within the Christian, that is, it springs from the divine life which abides in the heart of the faithful. But in order to practice this spirituality one must engagé in pro found reflection and foster interior « cultivation and observa tion », or the « recollection that penetrates movement and quietude » as the Neo-Confucianists say. This introspective effort makes one feel that his mind has grasped the divine source from which everything within him flows. It may be that this spirituality will not produce the same devotion and excitement which is present in colloquiai prayer, and it is pos sible that it will not foster the heroic attitude and the power of mortification as do the forms of prayer in the West. But it is more deeply rooted in one's real life, and more in harmony with the Chinese soul. Finally, the Chinese spirituality proposed here is also dif ferent from the « Christian Zen » promoted by the Japanese Church. As a matter of fact, there were conflicts between Neo Confucianism and the then contemporary school of Zen; these difficulties are more or less at the root of the distinction be tween the Chinese spirituality which I am advocating here and that of « Christian Zen ». First of ali, the God of « Christian Zen » does not truly appear to be the God whose Word is incarnated in human language so that man comprehends revela tion and applies ìts truth to his daily life. The School of Zen does not write words down, but points directly to the heart. Does « Christian Zen » take the Bible seriously? True, the School of Zen does study some writings, but these only serve to teli man that they point directly to the heart, and that they themselves are insignificant. This is not the case with the Bible which contains God's own self-communication. The</page><page sequence="50">54 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. Chinese spirituality which I prefer starts from the investiga tion of things and progresses to the extensian of knowledge in order to understand and believe the Word of God who is Jesus Christ. Indeed, through Baptism and faith, the life of Christ is already in the heart of man. But with the help of the Bible (by means of the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge) we can rectify our minds and make our wills sincere. In this way we recognize Christ's life in our own. « Christian Zen » does not squarely confront the problem of the Bible. Is it so inadvertantly influenced by the School of Zen that it too does not hold the written word to be of much value? In any case, the purpose of « My Humble View on Chinese Spirituality » is to suggest a spirituality which is based on self-cultivation so as to induce Chinese Christians to pray in a way which respects their culture and is in accord with Biblical revelation. In the foregoing pages we have introduced some com paratively prominent results of the present effort to inculturate Christian faith in a Chinese setting. There are other attempts, such as those dealing with Christology,76 but since they are stili quite premature, we can refrain from treating them here. III. The Future Tasks of Theological Inculturation in the Chinese Church Just as the report on the « former attempts » and on the « present stage » reflect my own subjective preferences, so too the « future tasks » which we will now discuss will be equally revelatory of my own point of view. Therefore they cannot claim to represent the opinions of other scholars. This should be kept in mind by the reader. First of ali, with regard to the method of theological inculturation, the materials that have been published thus far 76 Aloysius Chang, The Chinese Church and Christology, Ibid., no. 37, no. 37, pp. 435-451, Oct. 1978.</page><page sequence="51">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 55 should be put in order and a sensible pian concerning future research should be drawn up. Some of the discussions of the past center on theoretical principles which are much too broad and not specific enough, given the specific characteristics of Chinese thought. Every attempt must be made to be concrete and helpful to pastoral practice. With regard to the principles of inculturation, it is my opinion that, in addition to the reflec tion on and the critique of the past materials, we have to study the works which Western theologians have recently produced and then decide on some key methods of procedure that can be more easily accepted by ali. To do so will no doubt require a more thorough investigation of Chinese literature and of the Chinese way of thinking. With respect to Biblical exegesis, it seems that there is already a general consensus, although it is stili necessary to provide some clarification and to foster a more intense interest in the modem methods of interpreting the meaning of the sacred writings within their social milieu. II With regard to the subject matter of theological incultura tion, our future work should keep the following factors in mind: 1. Chinese culture, like that of other developing countries, is undergoing drastic and unprecedented change. Thus, the values treasured in the present are greatly different from the tradìtional ones. At the same time, due to the fact that the Chinese people are more receptive than others to various schools of philosophy, the latter have excercized great influence on the thought of modem Chinese. Many in the Church agree that it is chiefly the responsibility of theologians to offer a critique of modem Chinese anthropology from the viewpoint of Chris tian faith. Fortunately, this important task is already being undertaken by some theologians at present. 2. At a theological seminar held at Fu Jen Catholic Uni versity in 1977, Mr. Fu Pei-rong, a young philosopher and former student of Prof. Fang Tung-mei, spoke to the participants in which he mentioned ten obstacles standing between Chinese thought and Christian religion. I think that these should also</page><page sequence="52">56 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. be regarded as subject matter for future theological reflection: 77 A. Human goodness and the doctrine of originai sin. The Christian doctrine of originai sin gives the greatest scandal to the Chinese people. Since the explanation of originai sin has been amended again and again in the past one thousand years, it would be better to emphasize that « man is the image of God », in order that this doctrine and the Chinese theory of the goodness of human nature will be seen to complement each other. The age-old wisdom in the Chinese stress on human innocence should be of some use in restoring man to the originai image of God. B. Personal power and the power that comes from another. The Chinese theory of the goodness of nature is based on the power which comes from man himself; the doctrine of originai sin, however, stresses that true power comes from above. Yet Jesus said a long time ago: « It is not the one who cries ' Lord, Lord ', who can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father in Heaven. » Is the word « does » an indication that revelation itself fosters the power given by God to each person to be used responsibly? C. Immanence and transcendence. Chinese religion, in its pristine form, possessed a sense of both immanence and tran scendence. Due to the subsequent historical evolution, and especially to the humanistic direction chosen by the Con fucianists and the doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism, it continual ly emphasized the notion of immanence. In view of the various difficulties faced by contemporary Chinese, we should perhaps courageously point to the world of transcendence. D. The union of Heaven and man and the union of God and man. The union of Heaven and man in China is an ideal whose main purpose is that human virtue be identical with that of Heaven. But this immediate affirmation of the moral subject does not rest on an objective basis and offer a concrete norm. On the other hand, the union of God and man is the centrai doctrine of Christianity which views Christ as the model of ali mankind, and which further affirms the existence of eternai happiness, that is, the realization of the union of God and man. E. Universal harmony and imperceptible union with God. 77 Fu Pei-rong, Chinese Thought and the Christian Religion, Ibid., no. 32, pp. 215-216, July 1978.</page><page sequence="53">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 57 According to the mystics of the Middle Ages, these two terms are not in conflict; on the contrary, they are one and the same thing. Chuang Zi, a famous Taoist, often represented a similar position. F. Co-Creator and creature-consciousness. These two con cepts are opposed one to the other only because the angles from which the same reality is viewed are different. G. Confucius and Christ. This is a delicate theme. Though Confucius was the greatest Chinese sage, he did not cali him self God. His influence, evident from the place occupied by Confucianism in China, cannot be denied by any member of this particular culture. Christ, however, is God. Since God has given Confucius to China, He certainly arranged a special way to guide the Chinese people — the way of Confucius. H. The Jen of the Confucianists and the love of Christ. The meaning of the two terms are so deep and broad, that each of them comprehends ali the other doctrines of their respective systems. Jen is the true motor of endless production and love is the endless truth. The harmonious blending of the two is not difficult, unless those who study them are too superficial and only remain on the level of first appearances . I. Religion depending on morality and morality depending on religion. This difference accounts for the divergent ap proaches to life in the East and in the West. No doubt, each view has its own advantages and disadvantages. Perhaps the right way in the future will be to synthesize the advantages of both. Many theologians admit that Christian morality does not simply depend on revelation, but is greatly determined by autonomous human efforts to find just norms of behavior. Christ gave no new moral code, but a new way of living out a human ethics for the sake of His Father's Kingdom. J. The union of knowing and doing and the union of believ ing and doing. This is the true test of ali philosophical theories and religious doctrines. The adherents of Chinese thought and those of the Christian religion should strive for the highest attainment of « knowledge and faith » or « Jen and love », by means of « action ». 3. In the Catholic Church, the establishment of a Chinese theology is not an isolated event; it must be connected with</page><page sequence="54">58 ALOYSIUS CHANG, S.I. the tradition of the entire Church. So as to introduce Western thought into China, it is necessary that many translations be made. Many scholars agree that the translation of the Buddhist literature into Chinese was an element of definitive historical importance. How can the Chinese Church neglect the work of translating its centrai documents? Perhaps making the Greek and the Latin Fathers and the works of medieval theo logians available in Chinese will be seen as the imperative task of the next century. However, we should always pay close attention to translating the works of contemporary Western theologians, or at least some selections. Here it may be added that it is also very important to introduce Chinese theology to the Western Church, since such a practice will, at least mediately, foster the development of an indigenous theology. Mention should also be made of the need to translate reference books and prepare various theological dictionaries, since present resources are insufficient. Fujen Catholic University Faculty of Theology Hsinchuang Taipei Hsien Taiwan 242 (FORMOSA) Aloysius Chang, S. I. RÉSUMÉ Aloysius Chang, S. I. Dans les pays de mission, le thème de l'inculturation de la théo logie est un thème brùlant. Le Pape Jean-Paul II, qui en parla plu sieurs fois durant son voyage en Afrique, y fit encore allusion en visitant l'Asie. Comment l'Eglise chinoise s'est-elle comportée à cet égard? Qu'a-t-elle fait dans le passé? Que fait-elle aujourd'hui? Que doit-elle faire à l'avenir? Telles sont les questions qu'aborde cet article. La littérature sur laquelle se fonde cette enquète est limitée à celle de langue chinoise et aux théologiens catholiques, ceux-ci d'ail leurs exergant leur activité dans l'ile de Taiwan. En 1976, les évèques de Taiwan déclarèrent leur intention de « construire l'église locale ». Cet acte marqua un saut de qualité</page><page sequence="55">THE INCULTURATION OF THEOLOGY IN THE CHINESE CHURCH 59 parmi les tentatives de l'Eglise chinoise pour élaborer sa propre théologie. Mais, avant cette date, déjà, on était parvenu à un cer tain consensus soit en ce qui concerne la méthodologie soit au regard de la nature de l'inculturation théologique: la théologie chi noise ne s'oppose pas aux théologies des autres églises locales; corn ine celles-ci, elle fait partie intégrante de la théologie de l'Eglise universelle. Bien que son expression soit chinoise, son contenu n'est autre que la Révélation chrétienne. Par expression chinoise, cependant, on entend non seulement la langue dans laquelle s'expri me la théologie chinoise, mais aussi le génie du peuple chinois qui réfléchit la lumière de l'Evangile et reflète fidèlement le message. Deux notions confucéennes furent choisies qui représentent mieux la civilisation chinoise et se prètent davantage à la trans mission du message chrétien: la première, xiao, c'est-à-dire la piété filiale; la seconde ren, la bienveillance. La personne mème de Con fucius fut mise en lumière en tant qu'il interpréta, pour son temps, la volonté de Dieu au Peuple chinois. Actuellement, gràce à l'initiative de l'épiscopat et sous l'influence de l'intérèt inattendu de certains chrétiens occidentaux pour les religions orientales, les théologiens chinois se sont rendu compte de la priorité de la vie par rapport à la pensée. D'où la conclusion que l'église chinoise ne peut élaborer sa propre théologie sans vivre, en mème temps, une vie authentiquement chrétienne. Mais comment les chinois, en tant que tels, vivent-ils une vie authentiquement chré tienne? Les discussions, à ce sujet, tournent autour de deux points: la prière et la méditation. Le Zen chrétien, qui semble trouver grand succès au Japon, ne s'impose pas de mème dans l'Eglise chinoise. Les pères spirituels chinois préfèrent encore la pratique ascétique du néo-confucianisme. Après avoir observé le passé et le présent de l'inculturation de la théologie dans l'église chinoise, l'auteur pose opportunement la question: que faire dans l'avenir? Sa réponse, qui ne se laisse pas résumer en quelques lignes, consiste essentiellement dans l'invita tion à étudier soigneusement tant la théologie chrétienne que la culture chinoise et à les confronter l'une et l'autre à la situation actuelle de l'église chinoise.</page></plain_text>
