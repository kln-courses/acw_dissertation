In a comprehensive study he deals with a variety of genres of interpretation and emphasizes the important roles which the Bible played in Jewish intellectual life and creativity in Second Temple times.2 Bernstein includes in his study genres of explicit interpreta- tion as well as some hints about a large amount of implicit exegesis that can be detected in the scrolls. In this article I am going to intro- duce a special kind of implicit exegesis that can shed more light on Jewish worldviews in the Second Temple period. In an article published a few years ago, James Kugel showed that in addition to the known interpretation methods, like the pesharim, * This article summarizes part of my doctoral thesis submitted to Bar Ilan University in 2003.

In this article I wish to develop this subject, to define the type of hidden exegesis in the Qumran Scrolls and to study its importance. The type of interpretation that I will study can be called "inciden- tal exegesis." "Incidental exegesis" is commentary on a biblical pas- sage that comes incidentally, unintentionally, in works that are not exegetical. In these cases the author wrote for educational and reli- gious purposes related to the literary genre with which he was deal- ing without a conscious intention of interpreting biblical verses. Nonetheless, while writing the author used the wealth of images and knowledge common to him and the community in which he worked and reflected exegetical traditions that were accepted in his time or community. Incidental interpretations are frequently very fragmentary, and the author makes no attempt to explain the interpretation that he uses or to associate it with any verse, since he considers it to be "uni- versally known." Such exegesis is not methodical since it is not aware of being exegesis; however, much concerning the cultural world of the Second Temple period can be learned from it. The method of study of incidental interpretations is to seek paral- lels for them in other contemporaneous sources and sources from other periods referring to the same exegetical motif. Through these parallels we can fully understand the opinion expressed by the incidental exe- gesis and its meaning. The Apocrypha, the writings of Philo of Alexandria and Flavius Josephus, ancient translations, from the Septuagint to the Aramaic Targumim, the writings of the Church Fathers and Rabbinic literature all serve as a sources for comparison and study of the inci- dental Bible exegesis in the Qumran scrolls. "And the Giants did not escape"-the punishment of the Nephilim in the Flood The first example that I will cite deals with the question of the fate of the Nephilim in the flood. Were they destroyed, as it appears from the I J.L.

The scroll is made up of a single fragment, in which parts of two columns of text include a wisdom admonition based on the story of the flood. This text was edited and published by Carol Newsom.4 From the first column large parts of ten lines have survived. They deal with the account of the background to the flood and the account of the flood itself, with reference to passages in Genesis 6-9. In this column there are no quotations from the book of Genesis, but there are paraphrases of Biblical verses and expressions. From the second column only two to four words from the beginning of nine lines have survived. From them it can be learned that this column did not contain a story or exe- gesis but admonitory sayings in the third person. 4Q370 contains no sectarian terminology and the author uses the tetragrammaton, a practice that was not common in the non-biblical Qumran scrolls.5 The concept of free choice, that appears in the scroll in several places (1, 2-3, 2, 4) also differs from a sectarian viewpoint that professes predetermination.6 The spelling in 4Q370 is generally conservative, sometimes without vowels, and does not resemble the plene spelling with vowels that was usual in Qumran. In E. Tov's opinion, this makes it highly probable that this scroll was not copied at Qumran but was brought there from outside.7 All this evidence attests to the fact that 4Q370 is not a sectarian work, nor was it copied at Qumran, but can be ascribed to other Second Temple period Jewish worldviews. We will discuss here one exegetical point that emerges from the passage in 4Q370, in line 6 of the first column in the scroll: 4 Carol A.

And the gi[an]ts too, did not escape. This line is a paraphrase of the passage in Gen. 7:21-22, and the expression "the giants did not escape" is an exegetical addition to these verses: And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died. The innovation of the exegesis in 4Q370 is the addition of the giants to the list of those who perished in the flood. The giants are the hybrids born of the marriage of the sons of God and the daughters of man, as recounted in Gen. 6:1-4.8 F. Garcia Martinez considered that the object of this addition was to emphasize the main message of the scroll, that anyone rebelling against God is punished immediately,9 but this addition appears to have an additional message. Because of the position of the addition "and the giants did not escape" at the end of the list of those who perished and because of the emphasis on the fact that "they did not escape," it seems that the main intention of the commentary was to emphasize that the giants did not escape as opposed to other opinions that considered that they did escape.'0 However, unfortunately, we have not found in any Second Temple period source an explicit reference to the attempt of the Nephilim to save themselves from the flood or an interpretation of the biblical text that supports the position that they indeed survived. Since we have no contemporane- ous sources, we will look at the rabbinic literature in an attempt to 8 The name "giants" (giborim) for these hybrids is explained in Genesis 6:4 and in the "Pesher on the Periods" (4Q180) 1, 7-8. Devorah Dimant explained that the word "giborim" was interpreted as "giants" since the two words are associated in form and in meaning in Aramaic fn33 / WI-11 (gavra/gibra). See: D. Dimant, "'Angels that sinned' in the Judean Desert Scrolls and in the Apocrypha Close to Them" (Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1974) 45. 9 F. Garcia Martfnez, "Interpretations of the Flood in the Dead Sea Scrolls," Interpretations of the Flood (eds F. Garcia Martinez and G.P. Luttikhuizen; Themes in Biblical Narrative 1; Leiden: Brill, 1999) 99. 10 Such an interpretation can explain the appearance of the "Nephilim" again in the book of Numbers (13, 33) and the appearance of "giants" repeatedly later in the Bible (Deut. 1:28; Josh. 10: 21-22; 14:12-15: 15:13-14 Judg. 1:20, etc.). Were these the same Nephilim that were mentioned in the account of the Flood? If so, then the Nephilim, or at least some of them, survived the flood; if not, from where did the Nephilim in the Book of Numbers come?</page><page sequence="5">INCIDENTAL BIBLICAL EXEGESIS IN THE QUMRAN SCROLLS 5 understand the significance of the commentary documented in 4Q370.11 In the rabbinic homilies there are two exegetical traditions that can explain this interpretation. The first includes several homilies that describe the haughtiness of the giants who heard Noah's warnings of the im- pending flood and disregarded them. For instance: Rabbah expounded: What is meant by the verse (Job 12:5), "In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; It is ready for them whose foot slippeth."? This teaches that when Noah rebuked them and spoke words to them that were as hard as fiery flints, they derided him. They said to him: Old man! What is this ark for? He replied: The Holy One, blessed be He, will bring a flood on you. They said: A flood of what? If a flood of fire-we have some- thing else and it is called Alitha. And if He is bringing a flood of water, if He brings it from the earth, we have iron plates with which we can cover the earth, and if He brings it from heaven, we have something called 'akob', and others call it 'akosh'. He replied: He will bring it from between the heels of your feet, as it is written, "It is ready for them whose foot slippeth" (b. Sanh. 108b).'2 This interpretation deals with the question of why the giants did not prevent Noah from entering the ark."3 It claims that they jeered at Noah's words, doubting God's ability to destroy them in the flood, and therefore they made no effort to prevent the building of the ark.'4 Other homilies claimed that there was a basis for the haughtiness of " Not all the Second Temple period commentators agreed with the opinion that the giants died in the flood. An early and very widely accepted exegetical tradition claimed that they indeed died prior to the flood, killing each other. See for instance: 1 Enoch 10:9, 12; 87:1; Jub. 5:7-9, etc. See: Kugel, Traditions, 206-207. In contrast to this tra- dition, the commentary in 4Q370 supports the version that the giants died in the flood together with all living things; this commentary is also documented in Wis. 14:9; 3 Macc. 2:4; CD 2:17-21. 12 See also: Genesis Rabbah 30, 7; Yalkut Shimoni Job, 906. 13 The Babylonian account of the flood documented in the epic of Gilgamesh and the Atrahasis myth of the creation solved this question in another fashion. The pro- tagonist of the account, Utnapishtim king of Shuruppak, deceived the men of his city, tricking them into helping him to build the ship, but sailing alone. See: J. Klein &amp; S. Shifrah, In those Distant Days: Anthology of Mesopotamian Literature in Hebrew, (Tel Aviv: Am-Oved, 1997) 121-22; 277-78. The interpretation before us, as in other early commentators, determined that Noah tried to persuade his contemporaries to repent, but failed. Such an interpretation may derive from the attempt to understand in what way Noah was just (Kugel, Traditions, 185-86), but it also may represent a polemic against the Babylonian account of the flood and an attempt to distinguish essentially between Noah and Utnapushtim. 14 Another exegetical tradition claims that the men of the flood generation indeed tried to prevent Noah going into the ark, but God protected him. See: Tg. Ps.-J. Gen. 7:16; Tanh. Noah, 7; 10; Yelamdenu, Gen. 35 (Mann ed. 285); 'Ag. Ber. 4, 2; Yalkut Shimoni Noah, 55.</page><page sequence="6">6 GABRIEL BARZILAI the giants, and indeed there was not enough water to drown them, therefore God boiled the flood waters and thus caused their death: R. Hisda said, in boiling water they corrupted and in boiling water they were judged. In boiling water they corrupted-in transgression, and in boiling water they were judged-it is written here "C'DT IZ'"V' ("and the waters assuaged") (Gen. 8:1), and it is written there (Esther 7:10) "M=10 1b0,7 Momr" ("Then the king's wrath [also: heat] pacified") (b. Rog Hag. 12a).l5 Possibly the incidental exegesis in 4Q370 that stresses "and the giants did not escape" is part of an early exegetical tradition that subse- quently reached the rabbinic homilies, which maintains that the giants thought they could escape the flood because of their tremendous strength, but God plotted against them and they did not escape from punishment. Another possibility for explaining the emphasis on "and the giants did not escape" is found in several homilies that maintain that not all the giants died in the flood and at least one of them managed to escape. For instance: R. Zadok says that on the tenth of Mar Heshvan all living creatures went into the ark and on the seventeenth the flood waters fell on the earth from the sky- these are the male waters-, and the waters of the deep came up-these are the female waters, and they were joined together, and they increased to destroy the world as it is said (Gen. 7:19) "And the waters prevailed exceedingly etc.," and all the worlds on the earth dissolved, as it is written (Gen 7:23) 'and he blotted out every living substance,' apart from Noah and all that was in the ark with him as it is said (ibid.) 'and Noah only was left,' and apart from Og the King of Bashan who sat on one rung of a ladder of the ark and swore to Noah and his sons that he would be their eternal slave. What did Noah do? He made a hole in the ark and gave him food every day, and he also was left, as it is written (Deut. 3:11) "For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. . (Pirqe R. El. 23).6 According to this and similar homilies, Og was one of the last of the giants/Nephilim of the flood generation, who "escaped the flood," and therefore he was called the "one that had escaped" (Gen. 14:13).'7 In Is See also: b. Sanh. 108b; b. Zebah. 113b, Yalkut Shimoni, Noah, 55. 16 See also: b. Zebah. 113b; b. Nid. 61a; Yalkut Shimoni, Noah, 55; Lekh Lekha, 72-73; Hukat, 765. 17 These homilies represent an interesting exegetical process that centers on the word "Rephaim." The exegetical connection begins in Deut. 3:11: "For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim.. ." (also Josh. 12:4; 13:12). Og, who was left from among the Rephaim, is associated with another "survivor" who also survived from among the Rephaim, in Gen. 14:5: "And smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim," and subsequently in the same account: "And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew . . ." (14:13). See also: Gen. Rab. 42:8; Deut.</page><page sequence="7">INCIDENTAL BIBLICAL EXEGESIS IN THE QUMRAN SCROLLS 7 other homilies, Sihon king of the Amorites was also reckoned among those who escaped the flood: (Moses says) ... and I waged war on Sihon and on Og, the two giants of the nations of the world, who survived the flood because the waters did not reach their ankles due to their height. (Yal. 940).18 Another example is attested in an early homily that relates a com- pletely different story, but presents the same claim, namely the "Midrash of Shamhazzai and Aza'el," which is documented only in collections of later midrashim.'9 The homily tells of Shamhazzai and Aza'el, two angels who came down to earth in order to sanctify God's name, took wives from the daughters of men and begat two sons: When Shamhazzai and Aza'el saw this they took to them wives and begat sons, Hiwwa and Hiyya. And Aza'el was appointed chief over all kinds of dyes and over all kinds of women's ornaments by which they entice men to unclean thoughts of sin. Forthwith Metatron sent a messenger to Shamhazzai and said to him: "the Holy One is about to destroy His world, and bring upon it a flood." Shamhazzai stood up and raised his voice and wept aloud, for he was sorely trou- bled about the world and his sons, what his sons would do, what would they eat if the world was destroyed? For each ate daily a thousand camels, a thousand horses and a thousand oxen...20 Rab. 1:25; t. Nid. 61. The connection between the "Rephaim" and the "giants"- the descendants of the sons of God in the flood account-was dependant on the pas- sage in Deut. 2:11: "these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim;" according to the homily in Gen. Rab. 26:7: "The Nephilim were on the earth: They were called by seven names: Nephilim, Emim, Rephaim, Giborim, Zimzumim, Anakim, Avim...." The final result of this exegetical process is the homily in b. Nid. 61a: "As it is said: 'And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew...,' and R. Yohanan said: This is Og who escaped from the flood generation." See also Kugel, Traditions, 204, n. 25. 18 See also the first printing of Deut. Rab. 10:11: Constantinople 1512. See: Z. Neuberger, The Printed Midrash Deut. Rabbah: its nature and place in the Tanhuma-Yelamdenu literature framework, (Hebrew University PhD Dissertation: Jerusalem, 1999) 1-2; 8-9. This homily is not found in the Parma manuscript 1240, which is the complete man- uscript from among the Deut. Rab. manuscripts, nor is it found in other manuscripts. In fact, the two last paragraphs in Midrash Deut. Rab. of the portion Zot Haberakha, sections 9-10, are not in the manuscripts and were apparently added by the editors of the first printing from "Midrash Petirat Moshe" (Neuberger, Printed Midrash Deut. Rab., 15). See on this midrash: L. Zunz, Die gottesdienstlichen Vortrage der Juden: historisch entwickelt, (2d ed.; Frankfurt am Main: Kauffmann, 1892) 154. And see: Midrash Petirat Moshe Rabbenu, J.D. Eisenstein, Otzar Hamidrashim (New York: Reznik &amp; Menshel, 1928) 367, 369. This homily seems secondary to the homilies deal- ing with Og who escaped the flood, and it derives from biblical passages that mention Sihon and Og together, e.g.: Num. 21:21-35; Deut. 31:1; Josh. 9:10; and Ps. 13:11. 19 A.

Shamhazzai did not fear that his sons would die in the actual flood but that they might starve to death after the world was destroyed. A similar incidental interpretation exists in Pseudo-Eupolemus, which maintains that the Tower of Babel was built by the giants who had survived the flood.2' This tradition disagrees with the commentary documented in 4Q370. In contrast to the tradition represented in the rabbinic homilies and in Pseudo-Eupolemus, which determines almost inadvertently that the giants (or at least some of them) survived the flood, the commentary in 4Q370 emphasize that the giants died in the flood as did all other liv- ing creatures. Both of the dissenting sides in this polemic based them- selves on the verses in the flood account. Those arguing that some of the giants escaped the flood based themselves on the verse: "The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them: the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown" (Gen. 6:4). On the other hand, the commentators who maintain that the giants did not escape the flood based themselves on the passage: "All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died." (Gen. 7:22). It seems therefore that an early exegetical tradition, related to the perception of the angels in the Second Temple period and to the account of the angels' transgression that was widespread in this period, was almost completely lost. It survived only in several homi- lies that were elaborated repeatedly in rabbinic literature, and in an incidental exegetical note in a wisdom admonition discovered at Qumran and in Pseudo-Eupolemus. This tradition shows the great power attributed in the Second Temple period to the transgressing which were taken directly from the Talmud and others from early and late Jewish and Christian sources. In his opinion the entire homily is late (L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, [Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1942] 5.169-71, n. 10). However, see the analysis of this homily in Dimant, "Angels That Sinned," 178-80, which shows that the version of the homily maintains the early traditions that make up the account of the transgression of the angels in I Enoch. 21 This document, written apparently in the early first century BCE by a Samaritan commentator, has not survived, but two fragments of it were cited by Eusebius in his Praeparatio Evangelica. See: R. Doran, "Pseudo-Eupolemus," in: J.H. Charlesworth (ed.), The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1985) 2.861-62; 880-82; Y.

The flood is perceived as a lim- ited deluge, which could kill men but not the Nephilim, and indirectly this tradition also teaches about the perception of God, His capacities, and His limitations. "For according to the pattern of the Holy Ones created He him" Creation of Man in the Image of the Angels Another example of incidental exegesis, related also to the perception of the angels, is in a large wisdom work called Musar LeMevin.2 This is a didactic wisdom work made up basically of ethical instructions in matters of daily conduct, while a small part refers to theology, ideol- ogy, eschatology, creation, and God's administration of the world. Several expressions and ideas in Musar LeMevin recall like expressions and ideas in the writings of the Yahad sect at Qumran,23 but there are no clearly sectarian elements in it, such as determinism, good and evil spirits, etc.24 The existence of many copies of Musar LeMevin at Qumran shows its importance in the eyes of the members of the community. However it cannot be defined as a sectarian work. In Torleif Elgvin's opinion this document was connected to the pre- sectarian community represented in the early sources of the Damascus Covenant, and other scholars concur with his opinion.25 It is dif- ficult to determine when it was written, but scholars agree that I At least seven copies of this work were found at Qumran: 1Q26, 4Q415-4Q418a 4Q18, 4Q423.

The passage contains several incidental references to inter- pretations. Of these I will deal with the question of the meaning of the phrase "for in the image of the holy ones He created him."34 The interpretation of this sentence, in the opinion of A. Lange and J.J. Collins, is that God created man in the image of the angels,35 and this seems the most plausible interpretation.36 In their opinion this sentence constitutes a commentary to what is written in Gen. 1:27: "In the image of God created He him," in which the commentator identified the divinity with the angels and not with God.37 It seems that the motive for the interpretation of "image of God" as the image of the angels derives from the wish to avoid the suggestion 33 See: G. Barzilai, "Offhand Exegesis: Passing Allusions to Interpretation of the Book of Genesis, as founding the Dead Sea Scrolls" (Ph.D. diss., Bar-Ilan University 1993), in particular 178-79. 34 Crispin Fletcher-Louis's recently published book deals inter alia with the text in question (C. Fletcher-Louis, All the Glory of Adam: Liturgical Anthropology in the Dead Sea Scrolls [STDJ 42; Leiden: Brill, 2002). On page 114 Fletcher-Louis raises the same questions raised here, but he deals in detail only with the theological aspect of the angelic image of Adam. Here the subject will be expanded exegetically and as regards the image of men in general. 3S A. Lange, Weisheit und Pradestination (STDJ 18; Leiden: Brill, 1995) 86; J.J. Collins, "In the Likeness of the Holy Ones: The Creation of Humankind in a Wisdom Text from Qumran," The Provo International Conference on the Dead Sea Scrolls (eds D.W. Parry and E. Ulrich; STDJ 30; Leiden: Brill, 1999) 612-14. 36 The word :'arp (holy ones) in the sense of angels appears frequently in the Second Temple period literature. Thus for instance: Jub. 33:12; 1QH 11:23; 18:37; IQS 11:7-8; 1QM 1:16; 12:1, 4; 4Q400 i 15; 4Q405 18:2, 4Q418 81 1; 11-12, etc. On the other hand, in Elgvin's opinion, it is the "vision of the Hagu" (or meditation) that was created in "the image of the Holy Ones," i.e. the text of the Vision of the Hagu was created as a role model for the holy ones. In his opinion, the holy ones are not angels, but the chosen of humankind, unlike the "sons of Seth"-men of the "spirit of flesh" to whom the "Vision of Hagu" is not given (Elgvin, "The Mystery to Come," 140-43). He considers that in the passage before us the reference is only to selected people on earth and there is no reference to angels ("The Mystery to Come," n. 72). 3' A similar replacement exists in the passage dealing with Moses in the hymn "Praise to the Patriarchs of the World" in Sir. 45:2. The Hebrew words i77= M'i-M*tA ("and they honored him as God," documented in Hebrew in Version B of the Cairo Genizah), were replaced in the Greek translation with the words: "and they likened him to the glory of the holy ones" (&amp;64iS &amp;ayiv). This means that, according to the wording of the Greek translation, Moses had the likeness of an angel. See: M. Ch. Segal, The Complete Book of Ben Sira (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1972) 309; C. Fletcher-Louis, "Some Reflections on Angelomorphic Humanity Texts Among the Dead Sea Scrolls," DSD 7 (2000) 293.</page><page sequence="12">12 GABRIEL BARZILAI that God is anthropomorphic, a very common tendency in Second Temple period exegesis.38 The basis of this interpretation in the Biblical passage lies, apparently, in the plural used in the verse: "Let us make man in our image" (Gen. 1:26), which was interpreted as rep- resenting participation or involvement of the angels in creation of humankind.39 However, even though the avoidance of anthropomor- phism of God was accepted and the tradition of the participation of the angels in the Creation was known, the interpretation that maintains that man was created in the likeness of the angels is not explicit in any other Second Temple period source; from this point of view the passage before us is unique. Notwithstanding, there are many indirect signs that such an interpretation was known and perhaps even accepted. Thus, for instance, in the description of the act of the angels who rebelled against God and came down to earth, it is written in I Enoch: For men were not created for this, that they should confirm their faith like this with pen and ink. For men were created no differently from the angels, that they might remain righteous and pure, and death, which destroys everything, would not have touched them. (1 Enoch 69:10-11). This passage maintains that humankind and the angels were created in the same way for the same purpose "that they might remain righteous and pure." From the connection that the author created between humankind and the angels it seems that he saw them as resembling each other. Less pronounced but absolutely clear connections can be found in two later works: the long version of 2 Enoch, and the Life of Adam and Eve.40 38 One example out of many of this exegetical tendency is found in the words of Philo of Alexandria in Opif. 69, dealing with the creation of man: "Let no one repre- sent the likeness as one to a bodily form, for neither is God in human form, nor is the human body God-like. No, it is in respect of the Mind, the sovereign element of the soul, that the word 'image' is used" (translation from F.H. Colson and G.H. Whitaker, Philo, [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1929] 1.55). In these words Philo presented the avoidance of anthropomorphism as something known and simple, and it follows that this interpretation was accepted in his time.

In this source a figure called the "angel of the presence" tells Moses that God commanded the two upper ranks of the angels to observe the first Sabbath together with Him. Ac- cording to Jubilees, God told the angels of His plan to choose in the future one of the peoples, the people of Israel, that will be obliged to observe the Sabbath like the angels.42 The author of Jubilees thus cre- ated a practical and behavioral connection between angels and humans. In another passage in Jubilees, a physical likeness can also be found between angels and the children of men. In the account of the precept of circumcision (Jub. 16:23-27) the author explained the obligation of circumcising the sons on the eighth day by the fact that the angels of sanctification and the angels of the presence were cre- ated circumcised, and the children of Israel must be holy like them. Hence it seems that in the opinion of the author of Jubilees the angels had the form of circumcised men.43 In another passage the likeness between men and angels is inti- mated in another way: "Again it is written a second time: 'Let the one who lies with his father's wife be cursed, because he has uncovered his father's shame.' All of the Lord's holy ones said 'Amen, Amen"' (Jub. 33:12). This passage is a paraphrase of the verse in Deut. 27:20: 41 The main aim of the author of Jubilees in these passages is to present the spe- cial status of the Jewish people as a people sanctified to God, and as an earthly par- allel to the celestial retinue. In this way the author of Jubilees emphasized one of the main messages in his book, which is the prohibition of marrying gentiles and the main- taining of the purity of the "holy seed." See: J.L. Kugel, "The Holiness of Israel and the Land in Second Temple Times," Texts, Temples and Traditions (eds M.V. Fox, et al.; Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1996) 25-27. 42 On the significance of the mention of Israel already at this stage of creation, long before the actual forming of the people, and on the interpretation of the passage "Israel is My son, My first-born" (Exod. 4:22) in this context, see: Kugel "Holiness of Israel," 25-26; idem, "4Q369 'Prayer of Enosh' and Ancient Biblical Interpretation," DSD 5 (1998) 123-26. 43 See D. Dimant, "Man as Angels: The Self-Image of the Qumran Community," Religion and Politics in the Ancient Near East (ed. A. Berlin; Bethesda, MD: Uni- versity of Maryland, 1996) 98-99. Dimant stressed that there are different types of angels, and they have different likenesses. In her opinion the angels with a likeness of man are only those of the two upper ranks, the angels of the presence and the angels of the sanctification.</page><page sequence="14">14 GABRIEL BARZILAI "Cursed be he that lies with his father's wife; because he has uncov- ered his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen," with one important change. In the book of Deuteronomy the people answering "Amen" are the Israelites, whereas in the Book of Jubilees they are the angels. This difference derives of course from the fact that at the time that the account in chapter 33 of the Book of Jubilees occurred, the people of Israel had not yet been formed. However, the likeness between the passages creates a feeling of sameness between the angels and the Israelites.' From these examples it clearly emerges that the interpretation that man was created in the image of the angels was known and even self- evident to the author of Jubilees, as to the authors of the I Enoch, 2 Enoch and the Life of Adam and Eve. The author of Musar LeMevin mentioned inadvertently a famous exegetical tradition, from which only allusions survived in different works, and it appears explicitly only in his incidental exegesis. However, it is still not absolutely clear what this tradition is meant to teach. Is it telling us of the tremendous figure-almost divine-of Adam before the sin, or perhaps of the uniqueness and superiority of certain groups of people, who alone retain an angelic likeness? In the Second Temple period literature the second answer was emphasized. Thus we saw the uniqueness of the Israelites in the Book of Jubilees, and thus also in many sources of the Second Temple period that describe the High Priest Aaron and the priests in general, in the likeness of angels:45 He turned to Levi first and began to bless him first. He said unto him: May the Lord of everything-he is the Lord of all the ages-bless you and your sons throughout all ages. May the Lord give you and to your descendants extremely great honor; may he make you and your descendants (alone) out of all humanity approach Him to serve in His temple like the angels of the presence and like the holy ones. The descendants of your sons will be like them in honor, greatness and holiness, May he make them great throughout all ages. They will be princes, judges and leaders (angels) of all the seed of the descendants of Jacob's sons. They will declare the word of the Lord justly and will justly judge all his ver- dicts. They will tell my ways to Jacob and my paths to Israel. The blessing of the Lord will be placed in their mouths so they may bless all the descendants of the beloved (Jub. 31:13-15).i 44 Kugel, "Holiness of Israel," 26-27. 4S For a detailed discussion dealt with an exegetical tradition concerning the priestly garments adorning the priests and likening them to superior beings, see Barzilai, "Offhand Exegesis," 105-1 1. 46 See also: lQS 4 22-28; 4Q511 35: 1-4; 4Q545 I i 9-17 (=4Q543 3:1); and to</page><page sequence="15">INCIDENTAL BIBLICAL EXEGESIS IN THE QUMRAN SCROLLS 15 In the writings of the Yahad community at Qumran the members also described themselves as a shared community of men and angels.47 Many sectarian sources mention this viewpoint, as for instance: Those whom God has chosen He has set as an eternal possession. He has allowed them to inherit the lot of the holy ones. With the sons of heaven he has joined together their assembly for a Council of the Community. (Their) assembly (is) a House of Holiness for the eternal plant during every time to come. (IQS 11 :7-9).4' However, it seems that the sentence "for according to the pattern of the Holy Ones created He him," refers to all humanity, and not just to part of it. The suffix on the singular verb 11r (he created him) in the passage before us refers to Cr:s, a Hebrew word that represents all humanity; in the context of creation it means that VIA is a synonym of Adam.49 It follows that the tradition that views the tremendous a certain extent also in the Let. Aris. 97-99. The Biblical source on which these inter- pretations are based is the passage in Mal. 2:7: "For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and men should seek instruction from his mouth; for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts." See: B. Nitzan, The Prayer and the Poesy of Qumran (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1997) 209, 351 n. 12 (Hebrew); Fletcher-Louis, "An- gelomorphic Humanity," 295, 306-12. This tradition is also found in the rabbinic hom- ilies, for instance in Sifre Num. 119; Gen. Rab. 68:12; Lev. Rab. 21:12 (by allusion); Num. Rab. 16:1; Exod. Rab. 38:3; Tanh. Metzora, 3; Shalakh, 1; etc. This tradition again appears in a far later period in several piyyutim of Seder Ha'Avodah for the Day of Atonement. See for instance: J. Yahalom, Az be-Ein Kol-the ancient Eretz Israel Order of Worship for the Day of Atonement (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1997) 123 (Hebrew); D. Goldsmidt, Prayer-book for the High Holidays (Jerusalem: H. Koren; Academy, 1970) 2.452. 47 This is a possible interpretation for the many sources that will be presented below, although some of the scholars who have dealt with the angelology of the Qumran sect consider that, according to the outlook of the sectarians, the angels were indeed created, but they do not have a material form. See B. Frennesson, "In Common Rejoicing": Liturgical Communion with Angels in Qumran (Uppsala: Uppsala Uni- versity, 1999) 36. 48 And also in lQS 4, 24-26; 1QH 11:21-23; 12:24-25; 14:13; IQM 12: 1-8; 4Q511 35:2-5; Divrei Ha'Meorot (4Q504 1-2, vii 4-9); etc. For further sources and a comprehensive discussion see: Frennesson, In Common Rejoicing, 47-62; E.G.

Collins, "Powers in Heaven: God, Gods, and Angels in the Dead Sea Scrolls," Religion in the Dead Sea Scrolls (eds J.J. Collins and R.A. Kugler; Grand Rapids, Mich: Eerdmans, 2000) 23-24. A special place in the per- ception of the human-angel cooperation is occupied by the treatise Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice. See: C.A. Newsom, Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice: A Critical Edition (Atlanta, Georgia: Scholars press, 1985); C. Fletcher-Louis, "Heavenly Ascent or Incarnation Presence? A Revisionist Reading of the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice," SBLSP 37 (1998) 367-72; and see bibliography in Nitzan, Prayer and Poesy, 352, n. 33. 49 But see Elgvin, "Analysis," 74-75, who determined categorically that the phrase "for according to the pattern of the holy ones is His man's fashioning" relates to Adam and to mankind, and immediately afterwards he explains that the angelic image is attributed to Adam and to the members of the eschatological community.</page><page sequence="16">16 GABRIEL BARZILAI angelic figure of Adam as representing all humanity, was known in the Second Temple period. This tradition was dealt with by the Sages in later periods, and from the manner in which they dealt with it, its importance in the Second Temple period emerges. When we examine the tradition of the creation of man in the image of angels in rabbinical literature we find that it is quite rare,50 and occasionally harshly criticized: R. Pappias preached "Behold, the man is become as one of us [to know good and evil]" (Gen. 3:22) as one of the ministering angels. Rabbi Akiva said to him: Enough, Pappias. Why do you determine that behold man was as one? It shows that the Holy One gave before him two paths, the path of life and the path of death, and he chose the path of death (Mekilta de R. Simeon b. Yohai, 14:29).5' The few references to this exegetical tradition and Rabbi Akiva's explicit criticism of it derive from the rabbinical opposition to an idea embodied in it. There are those who explained that the reason for this is the polemic between the sages and gnostics in which the image of the superior first man played a central role. Because of this polemic many of the rabbinic interpreters refrained from dealing with Adam's angelic likeness.52 However, another subject may have caused the 50 I found it only in two late homilies: Exod. Rab. 30:16; Eccl. Rab. 7:1. The homily in Exod. Rab. belongs to the group of midrashim of Tanhuma-Yelamdenu and it dates from the seventh century CE. The style and language of this homily are popular and relatively late, and I did not find a like commentary in the earlier rabbinic midrashim. See Y. Frankel, Midrash and Aggadah (Tel Aviv: Open University, 1996) 3.765, 830, 833 (Hebrew). A distinction should be made between this tradition and the tradition on the tremendous size of Adam, which does not liken him to angels but to God (for instance: b. Hag. 12a; b. Sanh. 38b; Lev. Rab. 14:1). 5' See also: Mek. de R. Ismael, Beshalakh, 6; Gen. Rab. 21:5. Another version of this homily in which Pappias' opinion appears in the name of R. Akiva, and R. Akiva's opinion in the name of sages, exists in Exod. Rab. 4:3; Song Rab. 8:2. Apart from the sources specified above, there is an echo of this tradition in Pesiq. Rab. 47:16. And see: Ginzbeg Legends of the Jews 65-66 n. 6. A tradition connecting the image of man and the angels reached the Hekhalot literature, gnostic literature and medieval Jewish mystical literature. However, in this tradition, the world of the angels is arranged in the likeness of man. This may be a reversal of the tradition of the angelic image of Adam. See: M. Idel, "The World of the Angels in Man's Image," Studies in Kabbalah, in Jewish Philosophy and in the Ethics and Meditation Literature: presented to Yishaiah Tishbi (eds: Y. Dan and Y. Hacker; Jerusalem: Magnes, 1986) 2-15 (Hebrew). 52 Idel, "World of the Angels," 51-52 On the other hand Peter Schafer considers this tradition to be part of the mythology of the revolt of the angels, which derived from the angels' jealousy of man who was created equal to them, and even chosen over them. In his opinion the sages had reservations about this mythology and there- fore also about the interpretation under discussion. See: P. Schafer, Rivalitit Zwischen Engelen und Menschen (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1975) 95.</page><page sequence="17">INCIDENTAL BIBLICAL EXEGESIS IN THE QUMRAN SCROLLS 17 sages' reservations about humankind's likeness to an angel, and this is the tradition that humankind was created immortal like the angels.53 According to this tradition, the human was worthy of eternal life, until it was decreed that he should die after he sinned and ate from the tree of knowledge.54 This tradition has ancient roots and it appears already in the 1 Enoch 69:11 as cited above: "For men were created no differently from the angels, that they might remain righteous and pure, and death, which destroys everything, would not have touched them." In a clearer and more explicit way this tradition appears in the eschatological Apocalypse of Baruch, which deals with the fate of the righteous and the wicked at the end of days. Also, as for the glory of those who proved to by righteous on account of my law those who possessed intelligence in their life, and those who planted the root of wisdom in their heart-their splendor will then be glorified by transformations, and the shape of their face will be changed into the light of their beauty so that they may acquire and receive the undying world which is promised to them. Therefore, especially they who will then come will be sad, because they despised my law and stopped their ears lest they hear wisdom and receive intelligence. When they, therefore, will see that those over whom they are exalted now will then be more exalted and glorified then them, then both those will be changed, these into the splendor of angels and these into startling visions and horrible shapes; and they will waste away even more... And time will no longer make them older. For they will live in the heights of that world and they will be like the angels and be equal to the stars." In this passage there is an explicit connection between the image of the angels and immortality. These sources bear witness to a worldview in which there were two aspects of the creation of humankind. On one hand Adam/man was created immortal, like the angels, and on the S3 Some of the early commentators interpreted the passage "in God's image He cre- ated him" in the context of creation of man as immortal; see Kugel, Traditions, 81. Even though these commentators related to God's immortality, and the commentary before us relates to the angels' immortality, both traditions are based on the same verse and present the same interpretation. 54 Schafer, Rivalitat, 80; see sources that maintain this tradition independently of likeness to angels in Kugel Traditions, 96-97, 127. ss 2 Baruch 51:3-10 (OTP 1.638). And see: S.N. Lambden, "From Fig Leaves to Fingernails: Some notes on the Garments of Adam and Eve in the Hebrew Bible and Select Early Post Biblical Jewish Writings," A Walk in the Garden (eds P. Momfis and D. Sawyer; Sheffield: JSOT, 1992) 81, which connects this passage to the exegetical tradition of Adam's garments of glory; see also M. Mach, "Holy Ones-Angels: God and the celestial liturgy" Masu'ot: Studies in the literature of Kabbalah and Jewish thought dedicated to the memory of the late Prof. Ephraim Gottlieb (eds M. Oron and E. Goldreich; Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1994) 304-305 (Hebrew).</page><page sequence="18">18 GABRIEL BARZILAI other hand he was created with the inability to know good from evil. Only after he ate from the tree did man have the ability to make this distinction, but he lost eternal life and became mortal. The pas- sage from the Musar LeMevin under discussion appears to share that worldview. This view was opposed by Jeshua Ben-Sira, in an open polemic: It was He, from the first, when He created humankind, who made them subject to their own free choice. If you choose, you can keep His commandment; fidelity is the doing of His will. There are poured out before you fire and water; to whichever you choose you can stretch forth your hands. Before each person are life and death; whichever he chooses shall be given him (Sir. 15:1417).56 Ben Sira emphasizes that there has been no change in the essence of man since his creation. Death and life were given to man already at creation and man was never immortal."7 Man's fate is determined by his conduct. He has free choice and there is no change in man's nature. These sources show the existence of a controversy on the angelic likeness of man already in Second Temple times. This controversy continues also in the Rabbinic homilies, but is more concealed there: He created there four creatures above and four below, below: He eats and drinks as an animal, procreates and fights as an animal, leaves droppings as an animal and dies as an animal, above: He stands as the ministering angels and speaks and understands and sees as the ministering angels ... (Gen. Rab. 14:3).58 The controversial nature of this homily is discovered only after a com- parison is made between its various versions. Thus for instance Avot de R. Nathan, Version 1, 37 and b. Hag. 16a, maintain "three things as an animal" and do not maintain: "and dies as an animal." It seems that this is an echo of the early view that man was intended to live forever, and the later version in Genesis Rabbah disagrees with it. 56 According to two manuscripts from the Genizah. The subject of immortality is not the only polemic in this passage. The main part of the polemic deals with the ques- tion of the origin of sin in the world. See a discussion of this and bibliography in: J.J. Collins, "Wisdom, Apocalypticism and the Dead Sea Scrolls," Jedes Ding hat seine Zeit.. . (eds A.A. Diesel, et al.; Berlin: W. de Gruyter, 1996) 22-24. S7 These explicit allegations of Ben Sira seem to contradict his words elsewhere: "From a woman was sin's beginning, and because of her we all die" (Sir. 25:24). This verse was said in the context of the reference to a "whore," and it is typical of the wisdom literature. However, it does not correspond to Ben Sira's other references to the Garden of Eden account. This seems to be an ad hoc comment on the subject of women that does not reflect Ben Sira's perception of man's nature. See Collins, "Wisdom, Apocalypticism and the Dead Sea Scrolls," 22; Kugel, Traditions, 127. 58 See also Gen. Rab. 8:11.</page><page sequence="19">INCIDENTAL BIBLICAL EXEGESIS IN THE QUMRAN SCROLLS 19 Midrash Yelamdenu to Genesis 10 (Mann ed. pp. 274-275) also deals with the creation of man as immortal, and there too it is possi- ble to distinguish a controversial note against those who argue that death came to the world only after the sin: Come, and see the works of God; He is terrible in His doing toward the children of men (Ps. 66:5). R. Joshua b. Karha said: the terrible things that you bring upon us, falsely you bring them upon us. Come and see that the Holy One cre- ated the world, from the first day He created the Angel of Death, as it is said: "and darkness was upon the face of the deep" (Gen. 1:2), this is the Angel of Death. Man was created on the sixth day, and it is a calumny to say that he (Man) brought death to the world, as it is written: "for in the day that thou eat- est thereof thou shalt surely die."59 Thus, R. Akiva's explicit objection to the idea of the angelic likeness of Adam and the few references to this exegetical tradition in the midrashic literature can be explained in light of the controversy that we iden- tified in the Second Temple period as regards the immortality of Adam. Most of the Second Temple period sources reflect the opinion that Adam was created immortal, but there were also commentators who opposed this view and claimed that he was created mortal, a priori. In rabbinic literature, on the other hand, most homilies reflect the opinion that man was created mortal, and the few homilies that main- tain that man was created immortal or was created in the image of the ministering angels are late homilies. It seems therefore that commen- tators in the period of the Tannaim and the first generations of the Amoraim dissociated themselves from this view, perhaps because of the polemic against gnostics and perhaps because of the importance that they attached to free will. In later periods the sting was taken out of the controversy and therefore there was no longer any obstacle to going back to the early interpretation.60 S9 Further evidence of the existence of the polemic can be found in a homily that maintains the opinion determining that Adam was meant to live for ever, in Pesiq. Rab. addition 1:1. Schafer saw in this homily an adaptation of the homily of Pappias and R. Akiva, which argues against skeptical opinions that cast doubt on the possibil- ity of the existence of eternal life for man (Rivalitdt, 80). And see other homilies that maintain that man was meant to live for ever: Lev. Rab. 27, 4; Midrash Zuta Eccl. 3:15; Pesiqta de Rav Kahana 9:4; Old Tanh. Emor 12; Yalkut Shimoni Eccl. 967. 'I An elaboration of this early exegetical viewpoint, which was rejected by most rabbinic commentators, was some how conserved and found its way into the Seder Ha'Avodah piyyutim of the Day of Atonement. See for instance Goldschmidt, "Prayer- book," 449, 452; Yahalom, "Az be-Ein Kol," 123. It is known that the piyyutim were based to a great extent on the Bible and on its interpretation, but it is interesting to discover that many of the interpretations in the piyyutim do not have a parallel in the rabbinic homilies known to us. Only a precise comparison with early biblical exegesis</page><page sequence="20">20 GABRIEL BARZILAI "Towards thee shall be her desire"-hierarchy in the creation of Adam and Eve The following example concerns the creation of Adam and it is also taken from Musar LeMevin. The incidental exegesis in this case does not reveal a unique worldview that has vanished, but the way in which the ancients read the Bible in order to uphold an accepted worldview in it. In two of the copies of this treatise there is a passage dealing with marital relations (4Q416, 2 iii-iv, 4Q418 10) and it makes exten- sive use of quotations and paraphrases of passages in Genesis 2-3. Below is the passage as it was published:6' Jnnr wr' n-inrnn n ra: ..

(4) Thee has He set in authority over her, and she olbey thy voice allows us to discover the sources of many interpretations mentioned offhand in the early Eretz Israel piyyutim and in the medieval piyyutim. This fact may be fortuitous, since the midrashic literature in our possession is incomplete, and alongside it many more homilies were maintained orally that were not introduced (see for instance: Y. Heinemann, Aggadot and their History [Jerusalem: Keter, 1974] 17-21; 27-29; 43-47). It is possible, however, that this manifestation is not fortuitous, since many of the interpretations cited offhand in the piyyutim are early, and an educational and ide- ological reason can be found for their rejection or suppression. This reinforces the opinion of those scholars who consider that the editing of the midrash collections was tendentious, and that there was a logic in the omission of certain homilies from these collections (for instance: A. Greenvald, "The Methodology of Study of Rabbinical Thought" [Hebrew], Mileit 2 [1984] 148-73; Ophrah Meir, "The act of editing in Genesis Rabbah and in Leviticus Rabbah" [Hebrew], Teudah 11 [1996] 74-81). It may be sug- gested that homilies that did not find their place in the midrashic literature because the message in them was perceived religiously as not legitimate, were conserved by pay- tanim, sometimes inadvertently, in literature that because it was less didactic and less binding, could support their presence there. 63 The text is quoted from 4Q416 2 iii 20-iv 11 as published by Strugnell and Harrington, DJD 34.110-24. There is a parallel to part of the text in 4Q418 10 a-b, 3-10 (DJD 34.236). The text was also published by Torleif Elgvin whose reconstructions occa- sionally differ from those cited here.

The author, a member of the wisdom school, described what he con- sidered correct relations between a man and his wife, with reference to the account of the creation of Eve at the end of chapter 2 of Genesis, and in particular to the verse: "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh" (Gen. 2:24). Study of the way in which the author has used the biblical verses can teach much about his view on women's status in the home and society, and on the way in which he read the Biblical account. Thus, the hiphil form of the verb bt0 (set in authority/rule) appears three times in this passage: "Thee has He set in authority (L'TD,) over her" (4); "Her father] He has not set in authority ('l7vnrn) over her" (5); "and whoever, apart from thee, tries to rule ('100Y) over her has displaced the frontier marker of his life" (6). This form of this verb is related to the creation of the world in many sources from the Second Temple period, though it does not appear in the account of creation in Genesis.62 It replaces verbs from the root 6m1 in Gen. 1:26, 28, and its origin is in the creation psalm, Ps. 8:6, "Thou makest him to have dominion (7fl'r`VlM) over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet."63 Until now scholars have not discussed the 62 For instance: IQS 3:17-18, 4Q301 3:6; 4Q381 1:8; 4Q422 1:9; 4Q504 8:6. 63 See: W. Wegner, "Studies in Qumran Creation Terminology on the Basis of IQS 3:13-18 and Parallel Texts" (Ph.D. diss., University of Wisconsin, Madison, 1974) 138-39; T. Elgvin and E.

VanderKam; DJD 13; Oxford: Clarendon, 1994) 423; Elgvin "Analysis," 147, notes 3-4; Kugel, "Biblical Interpretation," 163. It must not be thought that the root i-Fl was unknown in the Second Temple period; verbs with this root appear in IQS 9, 23, and its paral- lels: 4Q256 8i 7; 4Q258 viii 7; 4Q259 iv 4; IQM 12:15, 19:7; 4Q301 2b, 3; and per- haps also 4Q422 1:8 (reconstructed).</page><page sequence="22">22 GABRIEL BARZILAI reason for the extensive use of the verb b,Onn in the context of cre- ation during the Second Temple period,T4 and it seems that the inci- dental exegesis under discussion can cast light on this enigma. In the past scholars thought that Psalms 8:6 was the only Biblical source in which the verb '= appears in the context of creation, but the passage before us shows an exegetical tradition based on a source from the Book of Genesis. By use of the verb *C: the passage under discussion connects to the account of the woman's creation the verse: "and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule (bOnr) over you" (Gen. 3:16), taken from the biblical text about the Garden of Eden. Likewise, by transforming the qal form in the Biblical source, "and he shall rule ('00') over you," to the hiphil form, "he shall have dominion (b'vnsrl) over you," it defines the husband's rule over his wife as part of the world order created by God in the creation .65 This exegetical process appears in an extremely conspicuous form in the sentence: "Her father] He has not set in authority over her, from her mother He has separated her, But towards thee [shall be her desire and she shall become] for thee one flesh." This sentence is a paraphrase combining two verses; first: "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh" (Gen. 2:24); and second: "and thy desire shall be to thy hus- band, and he shall rule over you" (Gen. 3:16). In this passage there is a marked connection between a verse taken from the account of the woman's creation and a verse taken from the woman's punishment in the Garden of Eden account. This connection appropriates the woman's subordination to her husband from the punishment and makes it part of the creation of man and his wife. Thus the commentator put the cart before the horse and at the time of the woman's creation already gave her an inferior status that the Torah gave her only later. There are various ways of interpreting the woman's status in the creation account of Genesis 2. According to some interpretations, because of the fact that the woman was created after man and in order to serve as "his helpmate" her status was decreed to be inferior.11 According to 64 G. Brin argued that the hiphil form of the verb 'Mc does not appear at all in rabbinic literature. See G. Brin, "Studies in 4Q424 1-2," RevQ 18 (1997) 39. Although Brin does not write this explicitly, it seems from the evidence that he presents that this verb form was characteristic of only the Second Temple period and in particular the wisdom literature. However, he does not suggest a reason for the use of precisely this verb. 65 See Elgvin, "Analysis," 148. 16 Such an interpretation is expounded in the New Testament in 1 Corinthians: "For</page><page sequence="23">INCIDENTAL BIBLICAL EXEGESIS IN THE QUMRAN SCROLLS 23 other interpretations, both are parts of one whole and there is an essential equality between them.67 In any case, however, it is clear that man's basic dominion over woman was renewed only after they ate from the Tree of Knowledge, for otherwise, where is the novelty in the passage: "and he shall have dominion over you?"68 The exegetical process documented in Musar LeMevin, therefore, has far-reaching significance as regards the perception of women's status. On the one hand punishment essentially is an abnormal situa- tion deriving from corruption. On the other hand, the reality described in the Creation reflects God's acts and is perceived as the normal, and even ideal, situation in which the world must develop. The worldview reflected in the incidental exegesis under discussion determines that the punishment decreed for the woman after she ate from the tree did not introduce a new status, since by virtue of her creation she is already subject to her husband and under his control. The incidental exegesis in this passage from Musar LeMevin teaches that the extensive use of the verb ~'71t00' in the context of the creation of Adam during the Second Temple period reflects a world- view that sees women's inferior status as a permanent, necessary and even essentially positive situation, and places the woman in the same rank with all the creatures over which man rules. The importance of this interpretation derives from the exegetical process that it reflects, since the worldview presented in it is in no way a novelty. It was man was not made from woman; but woman from man. Neither was man created for the woman; but woman for the man" (1 Cor. 11:8-9) and again in 1 Timothy: "I per- mit no woman to teach or to have authority over man; she is to keep silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve." (1 Tim. 2:12-13). See: E.C.

Conclusions To reconstruct the ideology of a period is a delicate task that involves an attempt to reconstruct as many exegetical and cultural worldviews as possible. Drawing on a multitude of sources and interpretations that are not identical in intention and purposes but that use the same sources and express similar ideas, a more complete picture of the period appears. The sources cited in this article differ as regards the time and place of their composition, the intention of their authors and their manner of expression. Notwithstanding, they have a common denom- inator, in that all were based on the same holy books, and interpreted them in similar ways. The words of Moshe Idel, who engaged in reconstruction of worldviews in the Hekhalot literature from diver- sified sources, also apply to the conclusion of a study of early bibli- cal exegesis: These literatures are branches of early Jewish thought that evolved in differing forms and in different literary contexts. Expressions of this thought were fre- quently changed, distorted, taken out of their original context, to be made sub- servient to new ideic frameworks. These changes, however, did not create an abso- lute separation between motifs that had a common source in ancient Jewish literature ... An understanding of the material to be found in each of these lite- ratures, which differ so greatly, is likely contribute to the recovery of the origi- nal conception.69 Intelligent and cautious use of the extensive exegetical material that can be found in incidental exegesis sometimes allows presentation of a worldview that existed in the past but that has been lost over time. At times it is possible to better understand the nature of controversies and polemics conducted in an early period, and to understand why exeget- ical traditions were suppressed in other periods. In other cases, this exegetical material assists us in the study of the way in which early Jews read the Bible, and the reasons that they read it precisely in this way. Thus study of incidental exegesis adds to our knowledge of early exegesis, and this for its part constitutes an important basis for study of the development of exegesis, both rabbinic and Christian. 69 M.
