ARCHAEOLOGY NEWS European Ice Age Art and Symbol The American Museum of Natural History in New York opens the first comprehensive exhibition of European Upper Palaeolithic or "Ice Age" art and symbol to be held in the United States from May 24, 1978-January 15, 1979. In line with the museum's role as an ethnographic and natural history museum, the exhibition has been organized to present the first art and symbol of the early Homo sapiens hunting cultures of Europe in the context of the ecological, climatological and social environment of the late Würm Period (ca. 35,000-10,000 b.c.). Rather than simply exhibiting archaeological masterpieces or arranging artifacts chronologically by period or style, this show attempts to present the material in terms of the content of the images, their cultural contexts and their possible uses. A major problem in preparing such a complete survey involves the extraordinary variety and range of the artifacts and documents available. Virtually every category known to historic hunting cultures is included - decorative costume pieces (bracelets, necklaces, headbands, rings, buttons), decorated tools, amulets and other nonutilitarian ritual objects as well as female figurines and animal statuettes. Ice Age art also encompasses complex symbolic burials and a number of different and specialized traditions of ritual engraving at habitation sites.

The well known, but regional, tradition of painting and engraving in the more than one hundred caves of France, Spain and Italy attests to the development of Ice Age culture. Each of these categories illustrates some aspect of what was clearly a complex practical, social and symbolic life, beginning twenty-five thousand years before the beginnings of agriculture and. "civilization." Chronologically, the exhibition encompasses the few known examples of manufactured symbolic artifacts from the Mousterian Period of Neanderthal man (ca. 45,000 b.c.); some of the earliest examples of decoration and costume carving from the Chatelperronian Period of France (ca. 32,000 b.c.); a few of the earliest known representational images, including the carved ivory statuettes of lion, horse and mammoth from the Aurignacian Period at Vogelherd, Germany (ca. 30,000 b.c.); and also touches on all the subsequent and more evolved symbolic traditions of the 20,000 year- long period that followed, known as the Upper Palaeolithic or "Last Ice Age." The decision to exhibit the full range of European Upper Palaeolithic art and symbol also posed a number of theoretical problems. The presence, for instance, of bone flutes and whistles in every period and region of the European Upper Palaeolithic documented a widely dispersed symbolic activity usually absent from specialized anthologies and discussions of visual art. Yet some of the instruments were as sophisticated, in their own way, as the images. A bone flute from the Dordogne, France, for example, had four stops above and two below, documenting the presence of complex fingering to obtain tonal changes. A similar flute of stag antler, containing four stops on one face and two on the other, was excavated from Moldavia in Russia. Both instruments date near the end of the Würm Period. The verification of a percussion orchestra at the Ukrainian site of Mezin, consisting of a set of painted mammoth bones including the skull, hip, jaw and leg bones, in which each instrument provided a different timber and tone, again illustrates the complex symbolic, ritual and ceremonial life which is only hinted at in the visual art and archaeological remains. Other evidence documents the widespread dispersal of even more specific symbols between the eastern and western Upper Palaeolithic cultures. For example, the so-called "Venus" figurines of the Central European Willendorf type, dating to approximately 25,000 b.c., are found in France (the Venus of Lespugue) and in the Ukraine (at Kostenki I, Gagarino and Avdeevo). 53</page><page sequence="3">Schematic vulvas in red ochre and plant-like form in black manganese from the cave of Castillo, Santander Province, Spain. Late Magdelenian Period, ca. 12,000 B.C. Copyright 1978, Alexander Marshack. Best known for their wide hips and pendulous breasts, they contain a number of specialized features that suggest the dispersal of more than just a carving style. The images universally lack a true face. While there may be occasional eyes and even ears and a nose, there is never a mouth. This is also true of later fertility goddess images dating to the Neolithic Period (ca. 8000-4000 b.c.). While lacking a face and stressing fertility aspects, the naked images from France and the Ukraine wear coiffures, bracelets and necklaces and have engraved decorated bands in front and back, all of which seem to be symbolic marks of the status or rank of the mature female and may be comparable to the motifs and attributes which accompany the later goddess images. It is significant that wherever these early Venus figures appear, one also finds small schematized vulva carvings, engravings and paintings. They show up in France, in Central Europe and in the Ukraine. Both the female form and the vulva image persist as separate elements until the close of the Magdalenian Period (ca. 10,000 B.c.), marking the end of the Ice Age. Perhaps the similarity of these figurines suggests that a basic fundamental symbolism, ritual and lore were carried out by all of the early Homo sapiens hunting cultures of Europe. There are, however, profound differences and regional developments in iconography and style among the different regions, to some extent influenced by the ecologies and ways of life in each area. The Magdalenian hunters of France and northern Spain, for instance, beginning approximately with the so-called "Lascaux" style of painting, dating to ca. 13,000 b.c. and ending during the Würm glaciation, ca. 10,000 b.c., lived with a variety of animals from different climatic and ecological environments. Magdalenian artists realistically rendered more than fifty species of animals and plants documenting their mixed ecology, often depicting the appearance, sex, age and the seasonal or sexual behavior of the species. No hunters' art of a later period has ever revealed such a wide range of fauna and flora. Magdalenian images include extinct species such as cold-loving wooly rhinocerous, wooly mammoth and the woodland Irish elk; cold climate species such as reindeer, musk-ox and saiga antelope; temperate zone herbivores such as the extinct wild cattle (Bos) and bison and wild horse; woodland species such as deer and wild boar; hill and mountain species such as ibex and chamois as well as a range of lesser creatures: lion, leopard, bear, wolf, glutton, salmon, pike, flat fish, amphibian, snake, seal, hyena, hemione, water bird, owl, insect, and a variety of plants and flowers. The analysis and breakdown of a number of complex Magdalenian compositions in the show illustrates that these images were used symbolically and 54</page><page sequence="4">Painted black bison with red ochre and black darts from the Salon Noir in the cave of Niaux, France.

Magdalenian artists, in addition, created a wide range of improbable, fantastic creatures and unreal anthropomorphic figures, also apparently for symbolic and ritual purposes, and some examples appear in the exhibition. It has long been known that Upper Palaeolithic artists created magnificent animal and female images, but it was believed that they made no comparable realistic self-portraits. In the last decade a number of such self-portraits have been excavated and published in France, Italy and Spain, showing bearded and moustached men in cap and costume, and women gowned and coiffed and wearing necklaces, bracelets and head bands. Some women are in prayer, some men are participating in ceremonial dance. These portraits totally change our image of the Ice Age hunter and maker of the art. A selection of these paintings, including many from the site of La Marche first published by Leon Pales of the Museé de l' Hommes, Paris in 1976, will be exhibited. In one hall a life-size, twenty-six foot long recreation of a major section of the famous ceiling in the cave of Altamira in Spain will be hung on the museum ceiling. A huge color photo-mural of the faded ceiling as it looks today will be placed below it for comparison and study, together with photographic details and enlargements of key images. The huge painting of the Altamira ceiling, carefully rendered by the Frobenius Institute in Frankfurt in 1937 on the basis of expeditions, came to the American Museum of Natural History in 1938, before World War II, but it has never been exhibited. Since the art and symbol of the Ice Age includes far more than animal and female images, a section of the exhibition is devoted to costume and decoration, the evidence of ritual and ceremony, as well as the library of mysterious signs, symbols and systems of notation that are found in the cave and habitation sites. The techniques and strategies utilized by the Upper Palaeolithic artists in painting, engraving and sculpting are documented, with an explanation of the modern analytic techniques, for example, ultra-violet fluorescence and infra-red photography, used by archaeologists to study the art and the nonrepresentational signs, symbols and notations found in the caves and on the mobiliáry materials. A number of important original artifacts are also on display and casts of other crucial artifacts have been specially prepared for the exhibit. The photo-murals and a number of unpublished, recent photographic studies of cave art were supplied by Jean Vertut of France. Painting of post-Ice Age rock art which subsequently appeared in all parts of the world are exhibited in an adjoining hall with many examples supplied by Douglas Mazonowicz of New York.
