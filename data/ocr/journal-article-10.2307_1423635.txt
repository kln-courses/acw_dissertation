<plain_text><page sequence="1">The dissipation effect: A naive model of causal interactions in complex physical systems PETER A. WHITE Cardiff University When people make judgments about the effects of a perturbation on popula- tions of species in a food web, their judgments exhibit the dissipation effect: a tendency to judge that effects of a perturbation weaken or dissipate as they spread out from the locus of the perturbation. In the present research the ef- fect was not affected by presence or absence of a diagram of the food web or by whether participants were asked to judge change after 1 year or 10 years. It was found to be associated with the structure of the food web, not with the number of links in a causal chain from the perturbation to the species being judged. The effect was strongest in judgments about time periods soon after a perturbation, but did not entirely disappear even in judgments about time pe- riods long after the perturbation. The effect is robust, but a full explanation still awaits elucidation. In recent years there has been a vast increase in the quantity and diver- sity of research on causal cognition, and causal cognition is increasing- ly recognized as a central topic in psychology and allied disciplines (Sperber, Premack, &amp; Premack, 1995; Shanks, 1995; White, 1995b). In almost all of this research, however, people have been asked to judge single cause-effect relations in isolation: For example, they are asked to judge the extent to which a covariate of an effect is the cause of it (Cheng, 1997) or whether they perceive the motion of one object as influencing that of another (White &amp; Milne, 1997). In reality, individu- al causal relations are not isolated from each other but tend to be linked in dynamic systems. Investigating how people understand causal inter- actions in systems is important not only for its own sake but also for the new light it may shed on the published research on judgments of sin- gle cause-effect relations. Researchers have made progress in elucidat- ing the naive understanding of particular systems, such as the causes of examination failure or interactions between factors involved in personal debt (Brickman, Ryan, &amp; Wortman, 1975; Kelley, 1983; Lunt, 1988, 1991; Lunt &amp; Livingstone, 1991; White, 1992, 1995a), but the daunting com- AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Fall 1999, Vol. 112, No. 3, pp. 331-364 ? 1999 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois</page><page sequence="2">plexities and individual characters of the systems investigated mean that the findings tend to have limited or uncertain generalizability. Studying the naive understanding of complex interactions is partic- ularly important in relation to food webs. The impact of human activi- ties on ecological systems has reached an unprecedented level: There are widespread fears that food webs are collapsing, with potentially di- sastrous consequences for all life on the planet, and those fears are fueled by a lack of knowledge of the effects of substantial perturbations on particular food webs. Aside from the involvement of motivational and political factors, the way we treat the environment also reflects our be- liefs about the effects of our actions and about how nature works in general. For example, a farmer using a pesticide on his crops may not want to decimate the population of peregrine falcons, but may do so nonetheless because his understanding leads him to believe that the pesticide will do little or no harm beyond killing the pests that are trou- bling him. Investigating this understanding therefore has both scientific importance in relation to causal cognition and practical importance in relation to human impact on natural systems. A series of experiments by White (1997, 1998) has uncovered evidence of a phenomenon that may be robust and generalizable, at least in the naive understanding of food web dynamics: the dissipation effect. The main aim of the present research is to test hypotheses about some fac- tors that may influence the occurrence of the dissipation effect and to clarify the nature of the phenomenon. I shall first describe the effect. A food web is a trophic structure of species in a community: Food webs map connections between species in the community according to their feeding relationships (Ricklefs, 1993). The structure of a food web influences the dynamics of its constituent populations (Ricklefs, 1993). The effect on the whole web of a perturbation, a sudden significant change to a part of it, is mediated by the structural features of the web. Researchers have found it difficult to predict the effects of such pertur- bations because of the great complexity of possible interactions, and food webs can exhibit chaotic behavior following a perturbation. Nev- ertheless, it is generally agreed that natural food webs tend to be stable because unstable trophic structures tend, almost by definition, to be short-lived. In addition, many factors promote stability in predator-prey relationships, and therefore in the food web as a whole. Stability in a population does not mean an absence of change. As Pimm (1982, p. 11) defined it, it is "that population densities return to an equilibrium fol- lowing a perturbation." Ricklefs (1993, p. 11) drew particular attention to the number and pervasiveness of processes that maintain and restore equilibria. Summarizing the research literature, Pimm (1982, p. 11) said, "Nearly all populations are characterised by patterns of change that 332 WHITE</page><page sequence="3">keep their numbers within bounds ... densities tend to return to a rec- ognisable equilibrium level or, more rarely, a cyclical pattern. Only a minority of populations fluctuate so wildly that an equilibrium level is not obvious." The findings of White (1997, 1998) suggest that laypeople do not share this understanding of stability in food webs. Instead, they tend to judge that population levels change following a perturbation and that the greatest change will be observed in species closest to the perturba- tion and the least in species furthest away. This is the dissipation effect. Distance from the perturbation is defined in terms of the structure of the food web: The distance of a species from a perturbation is the min- imum number of links that must be traversed to get from the perturba- tion to the species. Consider the model food web depicted in Figure 1, which was used by White (1997) and in Experiments 1 and 3 here. In this food web there are two species of plants, one preferring warm and dry conditions and the other preferring cool and wet conditions, and the two species compete for space. There are three herbivores and four carnivores, and Figure 1 depicts the set of feeding relationships between these nine species. Suppose a perturbation affects carnivore C1. Then herbivore HI is one link distant, plant P1 and carnivore C2 are both two links distant, plant P2 and herbivore H2 are three links distant, and so on. In some food webs there is more than one possible route between Temperature and rainfall Plant P1 Plant P2 Herbivore H1 Herbivore H2 Herbivore H3 Carnivore C1 Carnivore C2 Carnivore C3 Carivore C4 Figure 1: Food web used in Experiments 1 and 3 DISSIPATION EFFECT 333</page><page sequence="4">species; in such cases distance is defined as the shortest possible route (White, 1998). In one problem in White (1997), participants were told that over a period of years, the climate gradually became warmer and drier. This perturbation most directly affects the two plant species, which are there- fore one link distant from the perturbation. Given the structure of the food web in Figure 1, all the herbivores are two links distant and all the carnivores are three links distant from this particular perturbation. Participants estimated the effect of the climate change on the popula- tions of all the species. The biggest effects were estimated for the two plant species. Smaller changes were estimated for the herbivores: in- creases for those that ate the plant that benefited from the climate change and decreases for the rest. Smaller changes still were estimated for the carnivores, again with increases for species that predated herbi- vores that ate the plant that benefited from the change and decreases for the others. Thus, the effect of the change in climate dissipated in participants' judgments with increasing distance from the location of the perturbation. White (1997) set four problems involving perturbations to different loci in the food web shown in Figure 1 and found evidence for dissipa- tion in all of them. White (1998) extended this research in several ways. In Experiment 1 dissipation was found to occur in a food web with dif- ferent properties from that used by White (1997), including omnivo- rous relationships that considerably complicated the structure of the food web. In Experiment 2 dissipation was found to occur in reasoning about a model of a real food web. This experiment also found evidence of dissipation in the absence of changes in participants' ratings of confi- dence in their judgments, implying that changes in confidence can be no more than a partial explanation for the dissipation effect. In Exper- iment 3 dissipation was found to occur in judgments about a different type of physical system based on the hydrological cycle, suggesting that the dissipation effect may be a general feature of judgments about com- plex physical systems. Dissipation is not a usual feature of food web dynamics; indeed, the opposite of dissipation can occur under some circumstances, as in the case of DDT (Ricklefs, 1993). In the short term, however, changes in populations may be observed to be greater closer to the perturbation, simply because it takes time for effects to travel through the food web and for the interactions that tend to restore the previous equilibrium to take effect. The dissipation effect reflects ajudgment about an equi- librium state: Participants were always instructed to judge only stable effects, where stable meant a change that would naturally maintain it- self year after year, once there had been time for it to get established 334 WHITE</page><page sequence="5">and assuming nothing else interfered with it (White, 1997, 1998). Thus, assuming that participants complied with this instruction, the dissipa- tion effect represents theirjudgment of the ultimate state of the system, not a transitory stage on the way to equilibrium. As yet, however, little is known about why the dissipation effect oc- curs. White (1998) discussed several possible explanations and the main purpose of the present research is to test some of these. The first ex- periment tests the hypotheses that a manipulation designed to decrease cognitive load would reduce the dissipation effect and that people do not differentiate between short-term and long-term effects of perturba- tions. The second experiment tests the hypothesis that the dissipation effect is tied to the structure of the food web rather than to the num- ber of links in a causal chain between species. The final experiment tests the hypothesis that the effect may reflect a belief that effects of pertur- bations weaken over time rather than over distance within the food web by unconfounding these two factors. EXPERIMENT 1 Participants in the experiments by White (1997, 1998) saw written information about the food webs but did not see a diagram of the web. Even though individual pieces of information were in front of them throughout, putting those pieces together to make the whole model of the food web makes demands on working memory capacity. There are two possible effects. One is that, in the absence of a diagram, partici- pants may have found it difficult to construct a clear mental model of the links from a perturbation to a distant location. They may then have judged less change at greater distances because they were less certain about the possible routes from the perturbation to distant parts of the food web. The other possibility is that visualizing the web is a cognitively demanding task, so that sufficient capacity remains only for simple judg- ments. Thus, participants would have sufficient capacity to judge the relationship between a perturbation and a near neighbor in the food web, but they would not have sufficient capacity to judge effects on more distant species, which would have to involve consideration of the routes and species lying between the perturbation and the species being judged. This would tend to reduce their judgments for more distant species because they would have insufficient cognitive capacity to work out the effects. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by Green (1997, Experiment 4). Green manipulated load on working memory by varying the com- plexity of a food web reasoning problem. He investigated whether par- 335 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="6">ticipants in their reasoning about the food web produced a two-way causal account (e.g., animal A affects animal Z, which affects animal A) or a one-way causal account (e.g., animal A affects animal Z). He found significantly more two-way causal accounts in the simpler of the two problems used, suggesting that the tendency to unidirectional causal reasoning increases as load on working memory increases. That exper- iment was not concerned with the dissipation effect but does lend sup- port to the idea that demands on working memory affect participants' reasoning about food webs. In Experiment 1 the cognitive load hypothesis was tested by manipu- lating the presence or absence of a diagram of the food web. Partici- pants still had to trace routes and connections by examining the dia- gram, but they no longer had to make their own effort at visualization. The diagram eliminated uncertainty about possible routes to more dis- tant parts of the web and should therefore have excluded any possible effects of that uncertainty on judgment. The diagram also reduced demands on working memory and should therefore have facilitated judgment of effects on species distant from the perturbation, thus de- creasing or eliminating the tendency for such judgments to be reduced by the difficulty of working out the effects. If the dissipation effect is a function of cognitive load, therefore, it should have been attenuated by the presence of the diagram. All experiments on the dissipation effect so far have asked participants to judge only stable changes, and stable has been explicitly defined as meaning that the population will maintain itself naturally at that level year after year, barring outside interference (White, 1997, 1998). White (1997) suggested that the dissipation effect may occur because partici- pants have acquired knowledge sufficient to make reasonable judgments about short-term effects of perturbations (e.g., within a single season or year) but lack knowledge of the longer-term course of interactions within the food web. They then infer that the stable long-term effect will be the same as the known short-term effect because they lack grounds for any other inference. At an early stage following a perturbation, short-term effects may genuinely be greater at locations close to the perturbation because the full consequent process of interaction involving the whole food web requires an extended period of time. For example, if there is a sudden reduction in the supply of food plants eaten by zebras, a significant reduction in the zebra population will take an appreciable amount of time to occur, and it will be longer still before the next step in the pro- cess, significant reduction in the population of predators of zebras, emerges. So if we take a snapshot of populations a short time after the perturbation, we may find a considerable reduction in the food plant population, a moderate reduction in the zebra population, and little or 336 WHITE</page><page sequence="7">no reduction in the lion population. These are not equilibria; they merely mark an early stage in the process that eventually tends to re- store the original population levels. Under the hypothesis, however, this happens to be the stage about which people have knowledge. They don't have knowledge about what happens later, so they assume that things remain the same (i.e., that the early stage is the new equilibrium). The dissipation effect would therefore be caused by generalization from knowledge of short-term changes to stable new equilibria. This will be called the short-term generalization hypothesis. This hypothesis can be tested by specifying the time period over which judgments should be made. In this experiment one group was asked to judge the state of populations 1 year after a perturbation. This time nor- mally is insufficient for stable equilibria to be established. For example, bird populations normally take several years to recover from perturba- tions caused by a bad winter. However, it is sufficient for short-term ef- fects of the sort described here. Another group was asked to judge the state of populations 10 years after the perturbation; this is sufficient time for the previous equilibrium to be restored, assuming that no further per- turbations occur. If people have some appreciation of the difference between short-term effects and stable longer-term effects, then the dis- sipation effect should be weaker in the 10-year condition. METHOD Participants The participants were 60 undergraduate students of subjects other than psy- chology. There were 37 women and 23 men. Materials This experiment used the same hypothetical food web used by White (1997). All participants received a general information sheet that they retained throughout the experiment. They were asked to imagine that they were the manager of a nature reserve. They were then given the following information about the species in the reserve. Plant P1 thrives best under warm temperatures and low rainfall. Plant P2 thrives best under cool temperatures and high rainfall. Plants P1 and P2 compete for space: The more space one has, the less the other has. Herbivore H1 only eats plant P1. Herbivore H2 only eats plant P1. Herbivore H3 only eats plant P2. Carnivore Cl only eats herbivore H1. Carnivore C2 only eats herbivore HI. Carnivore C3 only eats herbivore H2. Carnivore C4 only eats herbivore H3. 337 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="8">Participants in the diagram condition also received and retained through- out the experiment the diagram of the food web shown in Figure 1. Participants in the no-diagram condition did not receive this diagram. Two written problems were then presented, always in the same order. These were similar to problems 2 and 3 from White (1997), except for the manipula- tions designed to test the short-term generalization hypothesis. In problem 1 participants were told to imagine that a new species of herbi- vore, H4, is introduced to the reserve. H4 eats only P2 and is eaten only by C3. Their task was to judge what effect, if any, the introduction of H4 would have on the populations of other species in the reserve. In the 1-year condition, participants were instructed to judge what would have happened to the other species 1 year after H4 had been introduced, and the phrase "one year" was underlined. The 10-year condition was similar except that participants were asked to judge what would have happened 10 years after. For the rating task, they were given a population descriptor, such as "popu- lation of plant P1," accompanied by the three alternatives "increase," "de- crease," and "no change." They were instructed to underline one of these. They were further instructed that, if they had underlined "increase" or "decrease," they should then write in a score from 1 to 100 indicating the amount of the judged change: "the bigger the change you think will occur, the higher the number you should put." They were told that they did not have to do this if they underlined "no change." They were to make this judgment for each of the nine species in the reserve. In problem 2 participants were first told to forget about H4 and imagine that things were as they had been before it was introduced. They were then asked to imagine that a disease was introduced to the reserve that wiped out the entire population of C2, without directly affecting any other species. Their task was to judge what effect, if any, the elimination of C2 would have on the popula- tions of the other species. Participants in the 1-year condition were instructed to judge what would have happened to the other species 1 year after C2 had been wiped out, and the phrase "one year" was underlined. The 10-year con- dition was similar except that participants were asked to judge what would have happened 10 years after. The judgmental task was as for problem 1, except that participants were asked only to judge the eight surviving species. Design Each problem was analyzed separately. The number of links distant from the perturbation was worked out for each species within each problem using the method described in the introduction. There were four different numbers of links (from one to four) in problem 1 and five (from one to five) in problem 2. The design was therefore a 2 (diagram vs. no-diagram) x 2 (1 year vs. 10 years) x either 4 (in problem 1) or 5 (in problem 2) (number of links distant from perturbation) mixed-design analysis of variance. Diagram versus no-dia- gram and 1 year versus 10 years were orthogonal between-participant manipu- lations, with 15 participants run at each of the four combinations. The dependent measure for these analyses is the amount of change judged to occur: Direction of change (increase vs. decrease) is disregarded. This is in keeping with the analyses performed by White (1997, 1998). 338 WHITE</page><page sequence="9">Procedure Participants were run either singly or in groups of two or three in a comfort- ably furnished office, supervised by an experimenter. If in groups, each was seated so that none could see what the others were doing. Each had a work surface so that they could carry out each judgmental task in turn while keep- ing the species information sheet (and the diagram, for those who had it) in view. Instructions were all written, so the experimenter gave a brief introduc- tion in which participants were encouraged to ask questions if anything was not clear. A few participants in the no-diagram condition asked whether they could draw diagrams but were not permitted to do so. After the experiment the ex- perimenter explained the reason for this. When all participants in a given group had finished the experimenter thanked and paid them. Apart from the infor- mation about the role of the diagram, participants were not debriefed at the time to avoid any possibility of contaminating future participants. After the conclusion of all the experiments reported here, information was posted on a noticeboard reserved for this purpose. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Analysis of problem 1 yielded just one significant effect: a main ef- fect of number of links, F(3, 168) = 80.290, p &lt; .001. Post hoc analysis with the Newman-Keuls test revealed the order as one link &gt; two &gt; three &gt; four, p &lt; .01 in all cases. This replicates the results of White (1997, problem 2). There was no significant main effect of or interaction with the dia- gram or number of years manipulation. If the limited capacity hypoth- esis were valid and the short-term generalization hypothesis were false, then Fratios for the interactions between years and number of links and between diagram and number of links should be significant. In fact, both Fratios were less than 1. Post hoc comparisons between 1 and 10 years, and between diagram and no-diagram, were carried out at each level of the number of links variable, but no result approached statisti- cal significance. Means for all conditions are shown in Table 1. Analysis of problem 2 also yielded just one significant effect, which was again a main effect of number of links, F(4, 224) = 65.397, p &lt; .001.

This also replicates the results of White (1997, problem 3). Although the difference between four and five links distant fell short of statistical significance, the mean for four links was higher in all four combinations of the between-par- ticipant variables, as shown in Table 2. There was no significant main effect of or interaction with the diagram or number of years manipulations. For the years x number of links inter- action, F(4, 224) = 1.806, p &gt; .05. For the diagram x number of links in- teraction, F&lt; 1. Post hoc comparisons between 1 and 10 years and be- tween diagram and no-diagram were carried out at each level of the number of links variable, but no result approached statistical significance. The greatest individual difference between means is that for 1 year versus 10 years within the diagram condition. The slope of the dissipa- tion effect appears greater for the 1-year condition than for the 10-year condition within the diagram condition, suggesting that the presence of the diagram might facilitate the attempt to distinguish between short- term and long-term effects. This possibility may be worthy of further investigation but the three-way interaction was not statistically signifi- cant, F(4, 224) = 1.739; a separate analysis of variance carried out on the data for one link distant revealed no significant effects; and no such trend is detectable in the data for problem 1 (see Table 1). Means for all conditions are shown in Table 2. The dissipation effect for both problems is shown in Figure 2. The means are consistently lower in this experiment than in White (1997), but the shapes and slopes of the curves are similar. There is therefore no evidence that providing the diagram of the food web made any difference to judgments. This may mean that the dissi- pation effect is not a function of cognitive load. On the other hand, it is also possible that the manipulation was ineffective. One possibility is that participants lacking the diagram might have worked longer and harder to visualize the food web, adequately compensating for the lack Table 2.

It is also possible that, although the diagram should have eliminated any uncertainty about routes through the web, participants without the diagram may also have elim- inated uncertainty by careful and prolonged scrutiny of the verbal in- formation about the web. The diagram might also have failed to de- crease cognitive load sufficiently for participants to handle the demanding task of assessing the complex interactions involving all nine species. So although we can conclude that the presence of the diagram had no discernible effect, we cannot conclude that the dissipation ef- fect is not caused by effects of cognitive load on judgment. The results are consistent with the short-term generalization hypoth- esis. It is difficult to draw strong conclusions from nonsignificant results; it was for this reason that the more detailed post hoc analyses were car- ried out. No test showed anything approaching a statistically significant difference. Fratios for effects involving the 1-year versus 10-year manip- ulation were all less than 1 except for the years x number of links in- teraction in problem 2 and the three-way interaction in problem 2, which were both well short of statistical significance. If there was any effect of the 1-year versus 10-year manipulation it was not detectable in the present data. These results therefore give no support to the idea that people differentiate in any way between short-term changes and stable long-term changes. 341</page><page sequence="12">It is possible that people judged that a stable equilibrium will be reached after only a year; in this case, the lack of difference between conditions would result from the fact that participants in both condi- tions reported what they believed were stable equilibrium values. It is still possible, therefore, that an even stronger dissipation effect would be found if people were asked to judge effects after a few weeks. Even so, the evidence of this experiment strongly suggests that the popula- tion changes characterized as the dissipation effect are judged to be stable equilibrium values, stable enough to be present 10 years after the perturbation. Whether or not it is caused by generalization from knowl- edge of short-term effects, the dissipation effect reflects a judgment about a long-term change. EXPERIMENT 2 In the dissipation effect, the amount of judged change decreases as the number of links distant from the perturbation increases. But actual- ly two things are increasing. One is the distance from the perturbation in terms of the structure of the food web. The other is the number of links in a causal chain from the perturbation to the species beingjudged. The aim of Experiment 2 was to disentangle these two factors: The num- ber of links in the chain of causal judgments was held constant and the distance from the perturbation within the food web was manipulated. Specifically, participants were asked to judge successive changes in adja- cent species over a series of time periods. In one condition the series of judgments took participants through a food web away from the location of the perturbation. In others the judgments returned to the location of the perturbation. If the dissipation effect is associated with number of links in a causal chain, then there should be no difference in the ten- dency to dissipation between these conditions. If it is associated with distance in terms of the structure of the food web, then there should be a stronger dissipation effect in the first condition than in the others. METHOD Participants The participants were 61 undergraduate students of subjects other than psy- chology. There were 38 women and 23 men. Materials Two-species condition. The materials consisted of a single sheet of paper on which the following was written: 342 WHITE</page><page sequence="13">Imagine a very small nature reserve in which there are two types of insects, aybugs and beabugs. Here is some information about these insects: Aybugs eat beabugs and nothing else. Beabugs eat plant material and nothing else. The diagram below shows a series of time periods. Suppose that, as shown, in period 1 more beabugs are introduced to the reserve, increasing the population of beabugs by 50%. How might this affect the number of aybugs in period 2? As- sume that if there is any effect at all in your view then the effect occurs in that time period. If you think it will increase the aybug population write "plus" beside "Peri- od 2: aybugs" and state the percentage increase (up to 100%). If you think it will decrease the aybug population write "minus" beside "Period 2: aybugs" and state the percentage decrease (up to 100%). If you think there will be no effect then write "zero." Now consider the effect of the change in the number of aybugs in period 2 on the number of beabugs in period 3. If there had been a change in the number of aybugs in period 2 would this increase, decrease, or have no effect on the pop- ulation of beabugs in period 3? Choose "plus," "minus," or "zero" and indicate the percentage change if appropriate. Then judge how this in turn will affect the num- ber of aybugs in period 4, and so on until you reach the end. Below this participants saw the terms "Period 1: Beabugs," "Period 2: Aybugs," and so on down to "Period 7: Beabugs." Each term therefore specified the or- dinal time period and the species about which judgment was to be made. The terms were organized in a column down the center of the page, with vertical arrows connecting each one to the next. Beside "Period 1: Beabugs," "+50%" had been written; this was the initial perturbation described in the instructions. Four-species condition. In this condition participants were told that there were four species in the reserve and were given the following species information: Aybugs eat beabugs and nothing else. Beabugs eat ceebugs and nothing else. Ceebugs eat deebugs and nothing else. Deebugs eat plant material and nothing else. The instructions were otherwise similar except that the initial perturbation was to the deebug population and the names of the species in the instructions were changed as appropriate. In the six time periods after the initial perturba- tion, participants had to judge, in order, ceebugs, beabugs, aybugs, beabugs, ceebugs, and deebugs. In other words, the successive judgments completed a transit of the food web, up to the top predator (aybugs) and back down to the site of the perturbation. Seven-species condition. In this condition participants were told that there were seven species in the reserve and were given the following species information: Aybugs eat beabugs and nothing else. Beabugs eat ceebugs and nothing else. Ceebugs eat deebugs and nothing else. Deebugs eat eebugs and nothing else. 343 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="14">Eebugs eat effbugs and nothing else. Effbugs eat geebugs and nothing else. Geebugs eat plant material and nothing else. The instructions were otherwise similar except that the initial perturbation was to the geebug population and the names of the species in the instructions were changed as appropriate. In the six time periods after the initial perturba- tion, participants had to judge, in order, effbugs, eebugs, deebugs, ceebugs, beabugs, and aybugs. In other words the successive judgments are each one link further away from the perturbation, up to the maximum of six links for aybugs. To summarize, in all three conditions the number of links in the causal chain being judged were the same: six. Numbers of links distant from the perturba- tion varied. In the two-species condition they were one, zero, one, zero, one, and zero from first judgment to last. In the four-species condition they were one, two, three, two, one, and zero. In the seven-species condition they were one, two, three, four, five, and six. Design The design was a 3 (two, four, or seven species) x 6 (time periods) mixed- design analysis of variance. Number of species was a between-participant vari- able, with n = 21 in the two-species condition and n = 20 in the other two con- ditions. The dependent measure was the amount of judged change; as in previous experiments on the dissipation effect, the direction of change was disregarded. Procedure Details of procedure are similar to those for Experiment 1. Participants would have been permitted to draw diagrams but none asked to do so. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Initial analysis revealed that the main effect for number of species was not significant, F(2, 58) = 1.555. There was a significant main effect of time periods, F(5, 290) = 23.640, p &lt; .001. Mean judgments tended to decline across time periods, as shown in the right-hand column of Ta- ble 3. Of most interest, however, was a significant interaction between the two variables, F(10, 290) = 1.965, p &lt; .05. The means for this interac- tion are presented in Table 3 and graphed in Figure 3. Simple effects analysis revealed no significant effect of time periods in the two-species condition, F(5, 20) = 2.155. Post hoc paired comparisons revealed that no time period was significantly different from any other. The effect of time periods was significant in the four-species condition, F(5, 20) = 10.848, p &lt; .001. Paired comparisons revealed several differences signifi- cant at the .05 level, as shown in Table 3. The effect of time periods was 344 WHITE</page><page sequence="15">Table 3.

Paired comparisons revealed significant differences in all cases, as shown in Table 3. The superficial impression given by the results is that the dissipation effect is strongly present in the seven-species condition, less so in the four-species condition, and minimal or absent in the two-species con- dition. There does appear to be a downward trend in the means for the two-species condition, and it is possible that each successive cycle around the food web is associated with less judged change; to see this, group 45 40- a0) 0) U -o 0 o 0 0 -0 c 3_ - - Two species - Four species - Seven species 35- 30- 25- 20- 15- 1 , , , , 1 2 3 4 5 Time period 6 7 8 Mean judged change over time periods for each problem, Experi- Figure 3: ment 2 345 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="16">the means into pairs for periods 2 and 3, 4 and 5, and 6 and 7. There were no significant differences in the paired comparisons for this con- dition, however, so no conclusions can be drawn. Closer examination of judgment patterns for individual participants is more revealing. It is possible to categorize participants into four ob- jective groups depending on the pattern of judgment exhibited. The four groups are strict dissipation, meaning that each successive judg- ment is of a lower amount of change than the preceding one (labeled "dissipation"); judgment of a constant amount of change at each time period (for example, increase or decrease by 20 at every time period, labeled "constant"); a sequence containing at least one judged change greater in amount than the one preceding it (in other words, at least one judged change opposite to dissipation, labeled "reverse"); and a se- quence in which at least one judgment is less than the preceding one and at least one is the same as the preceding one (in other words, with no actual reverses of direction, labeled "step"). Table 4 shows how many participants in each condition fall into each of these groups. This table sheds more light on participants' behavior. Most partici- pants in the seven-species condition showed strict dissipation: Every judged change was less than the preceding one. One participantjudged an initial increase at period 2 but then strict dissipation thereafter; another judged dissipation all the way through but showed one rever- sal at the last time period. The remaining four judged that the same amount of change would occur at every time period, and in three cas- es the amount was equal to that given for period 1, 50%. Participants in the other conditions showed more variable judgmen- tal tendencies and only 4 out of 41 showed strict dissipation. The cate- gorization of most participants into the reverse and step groups conceals a confusing welter of individual approaches to judgment. One gener- alization can be made about the four-species group, however. Consid- ering only the first three judgments, in other words those that move from the perturbation to the most distant part of the food web, all par- ticipants but one can be categorized as either strict dissipation (n = 9) Table 4.

The results show that the dissipation effect is associated with the struc- ture of food webs and not the number of links in a chain of causal judg- ments between the perturbation and the species being judged. In es- sence, the dissipation effect occurred when people were required to reason about a unidirectional sequence leading away from the pertur- bation. It did not occur when people were required to reason both away from and toward the perturbation. This is consistent with the idea that the dissipation effect in previous experiments (White, 1997, 1998, and Experiment 1 here) is an outcome of unidirectional causal reasoning: People reason about the effects of a perturbation only in the direction away from the perturbation through the food web, and do not consid- er more complex interactions or feedback processes. It is also possible that people do try to take interactions into account but have no strong and consistent ideas about how such interactions affect population levels. The variety of judgmental patterns observed in the two-species condition and in the latter three judgments of the four- species condition suggests that there is little consensus about the effects of a population change in the direction toward the original perturba- tion. This does not imply that participants in previous experiments on the dissipation effect neglected such effects, however. For example, they could judge that dissipation will occur on the way out from the pertur- bation and that various possible interactive processes then occur, but that these effectively cancel each other out, leaving the dissipation pat- tern as a stable equilibrium. The results therefore do not rule out the possibility of some intuitive appreciation of system properties. EXPERIMENT 3 Previous experiments on the dissipation effect have confounded dis- tance from the perturbation with time since the perturbation. One possibility is that the dissipation effect could be influenced by relative distance from the location of a perturbation in terms of the structure of the food web, so that less change is judged to occur for more distant species than for species closer to the perturbation regardless of the amount of time that has passed. It is likely that the effect will be judged to be smaller at later times, but the basic shape of the effect will not change until all effect is judged to have dwindled away. This will be called the structure hypothesis. Another possibility is that the dissipation effect reflects a belief that 347 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="18">effects of any kind tend to fade away with the passage of time. Under this hypothesis, judged effects are smaller for more distant species be- cause the effect of the perturbation takes longer to reach them. By the time it has reached the more distant species it has naturally dwindled because of the passage of time, not because of movement through the food web, so it has less effect on them. This will be called the passage of time hypothesis. To assess the extent to which beliefs about the passage of time account for the dissipation effect, it is therefore necessary to ask forjudgments about all species in the food web at each of a series of successive time periods following a perturbation. This amounts to orthogonal manip- ulation of structural and temporal variables: The effects of a perturba- tion can be traced both through the system and across time. Borrow- ing the terminology of Experiment 2, would the dissipation effect across the food web be as great at time period 7 as at time period 2? Answer- ing this kind of question could shed a great deal of light on the nature of the dissipation effect, and this was the main aim of Experiment 3. METHOD Participants The participants were 32 undergraduate students of subjects other than psy- chology. There were 21 women and 11 men. Materials This experiment used the food web shown in Figure 1. The materials includ- ed the information sheet and diagram used in the diagram condition of Ex- periment 1. The basic problem set for participants was the H4 introduction problem (problem 1 of Experiment 1). Previous experiments setting the H4 introduction problem (White, 1997; Experiment 1 here) have not asked participants to judge what will happen to H4 after its introduction. After its introduction, H4 is part of the food web and therefore enters into the interactions that make up the effects of its introduc- tion on the web as a whole. Leaving H4 out of the judgmental task therefore creates a danger that judgments may appear more unidirectional (i.e., only in the direction away from H4) than participants really judge the effects to be, and this could exacerbate the tendency to dissipation in judgments about the web. In this experiment, that danger was precluded by including H4 in the response grid. The response sheet consisted of a grid of 10 x 7 boxes. Across the top of the grid were the 10 species in the food web, including H4. Down the left side of the sheet were seven time periods, labeled 1 to 7. The boxes resulted from the in- tersection of the columns (one for each species) and the rows (one for each time period). All boxes in the row for time period 1 were filled with the number 100%. 348 WHITE</page><page sequence="19">Participants received the following written instructions for completing the response sheet: Imagine that a new species of herbivore is introduced into the reserve, herbivore H4. H4 eats only plant P2 and is only eaten by carnivore C3. The number of ani- mals of species H4 introduced to the reserve is roughly equal to the population of H3. Your task is to judge what effect, if any, the introduction of H4 will have on the populations of the species in the reserve over a series of time periods. To do this, you should estimate changes in the populations of each species in each of the time periods, as shown on the final page. Have a look at that page now. You will see some columns, one column for each species (including H4), and some rows labeled "time period 1," "time period 2," and so on. You will also see that "100%" is entered in every box for the row for time period 1. This is just a convenient way of representing the population of each species at the outset-obviously the actual numbers are likely to be different for different species, so I thought it would be easier for you to judge percentage changes. 100% is not meant to indicate the maximum possible population, and populations can either increase or decrease from that level, or stay the same. Make your judgements in the following way. Take C2 as an example. If you think the population of C2 will increase by 20% in time period 2, put "+20%" in the box for C2 at time period 2. If you think the population of C2 will decrease by 20% in time period 2, put "-20%" in the box for C2 at time period 2. If you think there will be no change in the population of C2 in time period 2, put "0" (zero) in the box. Of course, any amount of change might occur-I'm only using 20% as an example. You should judge for yourself how much change you think there will be, if any. Use the same procedure for all the species. Please make all your judgements for time period 2 first. Then go on to time pe- riod 3. Here, you're judging what change will take place from the level of the pop- ulation at the end of time period 2. For example, if you thought that C2 would increase by 20% in time period 2 and you now think it will increase by a further 20% in time period 3, put "+20%" in the box for C2 at time period 3. If you thought that C2 would increase by 20% in time period 2 and you now think it will decrease by 20% in time period 3, put "-20%" in the box for C2 at time period 3. And so on for the other species. Make all your judgements for time period 3, then move on to time period 4, and so on until you reach the end. If these instructions about how to make your judgements are not clear, please ask me: it's most important that you understand what you are supposed to be doing. You can assume that each time period is roughly three months long-in other words, enough time for significant changes in populations to take place, if there are any. To keep things simple, you should assume that there are no seasonal ef- fects. Obviously in a real nature reserve populations tend to fluctuate with the sea- sons-some species only breed at certain times of the year, and the death rate may be higher in winter, and so on. For convenience we are ignoring any effects of those kinds. You can assume, if you wish, that all species breed at a rate that remains pretty constant (per head of population) across time periods. Design Although there were 10 species, the main analysis to test the dissipation ef- fect used the number of links distant. This measure included H4, the site of the perturbation. H4 was therefore designated as zero links distant. P2 and C3 were one link distant, P1, H2, and H3 were two links distant, H1 and C4 were 349 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="20">three links distant, and C1 and C2 were four links distant. For this analysis, then, there were two independent variables: number of links distant (zero to four) and time periods (2 to 7). Predictions are summarized in a simplified form in Table 5. It is not possi- ble to be precise about where in the six judged time periods the critical changes should occur, but we can at least contrast early and late time periods. The most important feature is that under the passage of time hypothesis there is a rever- sal at later times, with greater effects judged for more distant species, whereas under the structure hypothesis there is no reversal. Procedure Details of procedure were similar to those for previous experiments. Five participants asked questions about how to fill out the response sheet. All five wanted to know whether the change to be judged in time period 3 was as com- pared to period 1 or to period 2. The experimenter assured them that it was as compared to period 2 and referred them to the written instructions explain- ing this part of the task. All five then continued without further problems. Three participants asked whether they could draw or write on the diagram or instructions and were told that they could. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The main analysis was a 5 (number of links distant) x 6 (time peri- ods) analysis of variance with repeated measures on both factors. Analysis yielded a significant main effect of time periods, F(5, 155) = 6.066, p &lt; .001. Post hoc comparisons with the Newman-Keuls test re- vealed higher ratings at time period 2 than at periods 4, 5, 6, and 7 (all p &lt; .01) and higher ratings at period 3 than at period 7 (p &lt; .05). There was no significant difference between periods 2 and 3. These results show some evidence for decrease in judgments over time, but it appears to be confined to the first two or three time periods judged (see right- hand column of Table 6). Table 5.

In addition, ratings at zero links distant (i.e., ratings of H4) were lower than ratings at one link distant (p &lt; .01), not significantly different from rat- ings at two links distant, and higher than ratings at three and four links distant (p&lt; .01). There was also a significant interaction, F(20, 620) = 5.571, p &lt; .001. Means for this interaction are presented in Table 6 and depicted in Figure 5. Simple effects analyses followed by paired comparisons using the Newman-Keuls test were carried out to investigate this interaction. Results of comparisons between numbers of links distant within time periods are shown in Table 6. Significant effects were found at every time period: at period 2, F(4, 124) = 21.514, p &lt; .001; at period 3, F(4, 124) = 6.492, p &lt; .001; at period 4, F(4, 124) = 5.049, p &lt; .01; at period 5, F(4, 124) = 5.152, p &lt; .01; at period 6, F(4, 124) = 3.603, p &lt; .01; and at peri- od 7, F(4, 124) = 3.424, p &lt; .05. In summary, all significant differences were in the direction consistent with dissipation. The expected dissipa- tion effect is found in its fullness only at time period 2. Thereafter, the difference between one and two links distant is significant only at peri- od 6, and that between three and four links distant is significant only at periods 3 and 4. However, one and two links distant consistently re- ceived significantly higher ratings than three and four.

In this way, the dissi- pation effect, although never disappearing completely, weakens as time passes. Comparison between Tables 5 and 6 clearly shows that the re- sults are consistent with the structure hypothesis, not with the passage of time hypothesis. There was no reversal of the dissipation effect at any time period. Simple effects analyses comparing time periods within number of links distant yielded significant results at zero links distant, F(5,155) = 2.442, p &lt; .05; at one link distant, F(5, 155) = 17.991, p &lt; .001; and at two links distant, F(5, 155) = 6.870, p &lt; .001. The effect of time periods was not significant at either three or four links distant, F(5, 155) = 2.126 (p= .065) and 0.496 respectively. Paired comparisons with the Newman- Keuls test revealed that there was no comparison in which ratings were significantly higher at a later time period than an earlier one. The ten- dency of ratings to decline with time periods is confined mainly to the first two time periods judged and to one and two links distant from the perturbation, although there is a decline at period 7 for H4 and a mar- ginally significant declining trend at three links distant. Although the slope of the means is less steep at period 7 than at pe- riod 2, the cumulative totals are most relevant because it is those that show the evolving picture of judged change to population levels in the food web. Figure 6 depicts these totals and it is clear that the slope gets steeper with successive time periods. Thus, although judgments within time periods show a weakening dissipation effect with the passage of time (Table 6), the cumulative effect grows stronger with the passage of time, although it is likely that an asymptote would eventually be reached. At first glance this pattern of continued change does not seem to fit well with the absence of evidence for change in judgments between the 1-year and 10-year conditions of Experiment 1. But it is possible, as stat- ed in the discussion to that experiment, that people believe that equi- librium has been reached only 1 year after a perturbation. Participants in Experiment 3 were told to treat each time period as approximately 3 months long. The period corresponding to 1 year after the perturba- tion is period 5. The simple effects analyses reported above found no significant differences between period 5 and period 7 at any number of links distant. This supports the contention that even if people do not think that a stable equilibrium has been reached after 1 year, at least they do notjudge any significant change thereafter. This may therefore help to explain the lack of differences between the 1-year and 10-year conditions in Experiment 1. 353 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="24">354 WHITE 80 60- -\L-- period 2 _.. ^s^ \ - - --- \-- period 3 cf 0 ) sn ' ^ -0-- period 4 0 e 6: C t o m j c e f ech period 5 --v -- period 6 Cumulate inceass and d easeperiod 7 20- 0 1 2 3 4 5 no. of links Figure 6: Cumulative totals of mean judged change for each time period, Ex- periment 3 Cumulative increases and decreases The test of the dissipation effect ignores the direction of change judged to occur. Dissipation is compatible with any pattern of judging increases and decreases in populations: A unidirectional pattern in which a given species is judged to show only increases in population or only decreases and a mixed pattern of increases and decreases result- ing in restoration of the previous equilibrium are both possible. In other words, one participant might judge that the population of a given spe- cies will become increasingly different from its preperturbation level and another may judge that any initial change will be at least partially can- celed out over time, and both patterns might show a dissipation effect. This amounts to saying that the dissipation effect is compatible with both unidirectional thinking and a kind of system reasoning in which equi- libria are seen as maintained and restored by negative feedback (Lasz- lo, 1972; White, 1992, 1995a). The present analysis is designed to investigate the kind of cumulative change in population levels that isjudged to occur. This is different from the results presented in Figure 6, which show cumulative totals in amount ofjudged change, without regard for whether any given judged change is an increase or a decrease. The measure in this case is mean deviation from zero; that is, we want to see how far the population of a species is</page><page sequence="25">judged by a participant to deviate from its initial level over time, and then to look at the means of those judged deviations across participants. Initially, for each species and for each participant a cumulative record was constructed. For example, if participant 1 judged an increase of 20% in P1 at time period 2 and a decrease of 20% at period 3, then the cu- mulative deviation from zero at period 3 would be zero (20 minus 20). In this analysis it is the amount of deviation from zero that is of inter- est, not the direction. For example, if participant 1 judged an increase of 20% in P1 at time period 2 and participant 2 judged a decrease of 20% in P1 for the same time period, that would give a mean deviation of 20, not zero. In other words, the direction of the deviation is recorded for individual participants but for calculating overall means it is the size of the deviations that is of interest, not their direction. In this case each species is analyzed separately so the design is a 10 (species) x 6 (time periods) analysis of variance with repeated measures on each factor. Strictly speaking, analysis of variance is not appropriate here because the species variable does not satisfy even the ordinal rela- tion assumption. However, the pattern in the results is both clear and consistent with other findings reported here, and no other kind of anal- ysis would enable the desired comparisons to be made. The findings should perhaps be regarded as requiring confirmation by other means, although the two main effects to be reported are so strong that they are likely to prove robust. Analysis yielded a main effect of time periods, F(5, 155) = 39.949, p &lt; .001. Every time period showed a greater mean deviation than the one before. There was also a significant effect of species, F(9, 279) = 7.042, p &lt; .001. Greater deviation from zero is found for some species than for others. The pattern of differences exactly resembles the dissipation ef- fect. Ignoring H4 for the moment, species at one link distant (P2 and C3) show greater judged deviation than all other species at all time periods, except that C3 shows less deviation than P1 at period 2. The three species at two links distant (P1, H2, and H3) show greaterjudged deviation than all the remaining species at all time periods except that judged deviation is marginally lower for H2 than for C4 at period 4. Finally, the two species at three links distant (H1 and C4) show greater judged deviation than the two species at four links distant (C2 and C3) at every time period. These results are depicted in Figure 7. H4 generally shows similar levels of judged deviation to species two links distant. This implies thatjudged change is not simply unidirection- al: If it were, participants would judge zero change for H4 throughout. Some appreciation of interactive properties of the food web is neces- sary for participants to judge that moderate changes in the population of H4 will occur following its introduction.

This possibility should be investigated further. There was also a significant interaction between the two variables, F(45, 1395) = 1.457, p &lt; .05. The change in mean deviation from peri- od 2 to period 7 is different for different species, from 17.08 for C1 to 30.75 for C3. As Figure 7 shows, however, the pattern in the main ef- fect of time periods is replicated for every individual species: Every spe- cies shows an increase in mean deviation at every time period. Of course, that analysis does not tell us what actually happens to the species. The mean deviation from zero tends to increase for each spe- cies, but if the number of participants judging that a given species will increase is the same as the number judging that it will decrease, then the mean population change for that species could be zero at each time period. Figure 8 therefore shows the mean judged population changes across the time periods. Species are identified by the same symbols as in Figure 7. For most species there is a fair consensus over the direc- tion of change and most show roughly linear increasing or decreasing tendencies. It is noticeable once again that the biggest population changes tend to occur for species close to the perturbation and the smallest for those furthest away. H1 is the solitary exception to this, however, and in this case roughly half of the participants judged an 356 WHITE</page><page sequence="27">DISSIPATION EFFECT 357 increase and the remainder a decrease. Apart from this, the right-hand branch of the web loses out from the introduction of H4 and the left- hand branches benefit. Individual differences and dissipation Although the analysis in the previous section found that the aggre- gate tendency in the data is unidirectional change in population levels, not all participants conformed to that tendency. Altogether, 11 partici- pants judged only unidirectional changes for all 10 species (disregard- ing judgments of zero change). That is, for a given species judgments of change made by the participant were either all increases or all de- creases. All such participants judged increases for some species and decreases for others, but in no case was there a within-species reversal of direction of change. A further six participants showed no more than one within-species reversal of direction (i.e., either increase followed by decrease or decrease followed by increase) for at least 1 of the 10 spe- cies. The remaining 15 participants, nearly half of the sample, showed two or more within-species reversals of direction of change for at least 1 of the 10 species.

For example, they might appreciate that a sub- stantial increase in the population of a species will eventually be coun- teracted either by the consequent decline in the population of whatever it eats or by the limited carrying capacity of the system as a whole. It is possible that some people believe that population levels of a given spe- cies naturally oscillate following a perturbation without holding inter- active properties of the system responsible for that, but it is not clear what alternative understanding such people might have. Be that as it may, White (1997) argued that the dissipation effect represents unidi- rectional causal reasoning and it follows from that argument that the dissipation effect should be strongest among participants who clearly show unidirectional reasoning in their judgments of change. The fol- lowing analysis tests that reasoning. Participants were divided into three groups along the lines just de- scribed: those showing no within-species reversals of direction (second column of Table 7), those showing no more than one within-species reversal of direction for at least 1 of the 10 species (third column of Table 7), and those showing two or more within-species reversals of direction of change for at least 1 of the 10 species (right-hand column of Table 7). Means for each of these groups at each number of links distant from the perturbation are given in Table 7. Analysis revealed a significant main effect of the participant group- ing, F(2, 29) = 4.207, p &lt; .05. Post hoc comparisons with the Newman- Keuls test revealed that the mean for the two or more changes group was higher than those for the other two groups (p &lt; .05 in both cases). There was also a significant main effect of number of links distant, F(4, 116) = 15.243, p &lt; .001. This is the overall dissipation effect reported at the start of this Results section. The interaction between the two variables was not significant, how- ever: F(8, 116) = 0.953. As can be seen in Table 7, all three groups show the dissipation effect and this analysis shows that there is no detectable Table 7.

This result gives no support to the hypothesis that the dissipation effect is consequent upon unidirectional causal reasoning and it therefore appears to be an independent phenomenon. GENERAL DISCUSSION These three experiments provide further evidence of the robustness of the dissipation effect. The effect was not weakened by the provision of a diagram of the food web to reduce the strain on working memory capacity (Experiment 1). Whether participants were asked to judge change after 1 year or after 10 years made no detectable difference (Experiment 1). The effect was shown not to result from the number of links in a chain of causal judgments between the perturbation and the species beingjudged (Experiment 2). It was also shown to be asso- ciated with the structure of the food web when the passage of time was manipulated orthogonally (Experiment 3). In Experiment 3 the dissi- pation effect was strongest in the time periods closest to the perturba- tion and declined thereafter, but judged change was still greater for species closer to the perturbation even after seven time periods. The results of Experiment 3 also failed to support the idea that the dissipa- tion effect is a consequence of unidirectional causal reasoning. Green (1997) has found evidence that people can engage in two-way causal thinking when they have only two species to consider, one pred- ator and one prey. But when only one further species is added, the pro- portion of two-way causal thinking drops to a low level and unidirectional thinking takes over for most of the participants. The food webs used in all studies of the dissipation effect so far carried out (White, 1997, 1998, and here) have been complex, so on the basis of Green's findings it could still be argued that complexity, and the consequent overloading of work- ing memory capacity, is responsible for the dissipation effect. However, there is evidence that complexity or load on working mem- ory is unlikely to be responsible for the dissipation effect. In Experiment 1 provision of the diagram of the food web to reduce load on working memory had no discernible effect. In Experiment 2, a strong dissipa- tion effect was found in the seven-species condition and little or none was found in the two- and four-species conditions. At first glance this seems to favor the complexity interpretation because dissipation was found in the condition with most species. Complexity is unlikely to be the explanation, however, because of the sequential nature of the causal inferences in that condition. Participants in the seven-species condition were asked to judge the effect of a change in one species at time 1 on 359 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="30">one other species at time 2, then to judge the effect of the change in the second species at time 2 on a third species at time 3, and so on. In other words, to make each individual judgment they did not have to con- sider the rest of the food web or its interactive properties; they were merelyjudging a one-time effect of one population change on the spe- cies next to it in the food web. Each individual judgment is therefore as simple in relation to cognitive capacity in the seven-species condition as it is in the two-species condition. The strong dissipation effect found in the former therefore cannot result from task complexity or overload- ing cognitive capacity. Experiment 1 found no difference between the 1-year and 10-year conditions. In Experiment 3, although the dissipation effect was stron- gest at the first time period judged, it had not completely disappeared even at period 7, and Figure 6 shows that by one measure it could even be regarded as increasing rather than decreasing with the passage of time. These findings give some support to the idea that the dissipation effect is caused by inductive generalization from knowledge of short- term effects of perturbations. As was explained in the introduction to Experiment 1, immediately following a perturbation the greatest effects are likely to be found among species close to the location of the per- turbation in terms of the structure of the food web. A shortage of grass, for example, will begin to affect the zebra population before the effect on the zebra population has an effect on the lion population. So, shortly after a perturbation, the pattern of population change may resemble the dissipation effect. Expert knowledge is not required to assess such short-term effects; one needs to know only that lions eat zebras in order to infer that a decline in the zebra population is more likely to lead to a decrease than to an increase in the lion population in the short term. But inferring beyond that to stable long-term effects is less straightforward: How does one assess the subsequent pattern of interactions between the popula- tion changes of grass, zebras, and lions? Perhaps inferring that the sta- ble pattern will resemble the short-term effect is the simplest way out of an impossibly complex reasoning problem. Thus, the dissipation ef- fect may be the product of an inductive generalization from short-term effects to stable effects, made because of the insuperable difficulties of working out the full set of possible interactions. Although this is a plausible hypothesis, it is not entirely satisfactory. Other simple inferences are also possible. It is just as simple to assume that short-term effects will get ironed out in the long run, so that pop- ulations tend to revert to their previous equilibria. Under that assump- tion the dissipation effect would not occur. The dissipation effect has proved robust across several experiments (White, 1997, 1998, and here) 360 WHITE</page><page sequence="31">so there is no evidence that participants make such an assumption. But because generalization of short-term effects and reversion to previous equilibrium are equally simple inferential strategies, it is not clear why the former is preferred to the latter. In addition, the hypothesis fails to explain the results of Experiment 2. All judgments made in Experiment 2 are of short-term effects: the effect of a change in the population of one species at one time period on that of another species at the next time period. If people generally judge that short-term changes exhibit dissipation, then a dissipation-like pattern ought to have been found in all three conditions. In fact, the dissipation effect was absent from the two-species condition and weak in the four-species condition, whereas it was strong in the seven-species condition. The passage of time periods is identical across these three conditions. The only difference between the conditions is the structure of the food web. Thus, although inductive generalization from short- term effects may be part of the explanation for the dissipation effect, the results of Experiment 2 show that structural factors also play a part. There are many possible physical analogies for the dissipation effect because many familiar physical systems either exhibit or appear to ex- hibit dissipation (White, 1997). Let us consider two: a wave analogy and a drum analogy. Under the wave analogy, a perturbation is analogous to a stone dropped into a pool of water, causing a wave to radiate out across the surface of the water. This is analogous to the dissipation ef- fect. At early times the wave reaches the species closest to the pertur- bation and those farther away are as yet unaffected. As time passes, the wave rolls over the more distant species, but is smaller in proportion to the distance traveled. Under the wave analogy, dissipation would occur because of something analogous to the inverse square law, a natural weakening of the effect as it spreads out over greater and greater areas. Under this analogy, however, when the wave reaches the distant parts of the food web one would expect the greatestjudged change at those distant parts, because the wave has passed over the species closest to the original perturbation and moved on. The analogy therefore predicts that, at later time periods in Experiment 3, greater changes should be judged for more distant species than for species close to the perturba- tion. This was not found: Even at period 7, judged change still tended to be greater at one and two links distant than at three and four links distant. This result does not support the wave analogy. For the drum analogy, imagine a circular drum with a rubber mem- brane, the membrane lying horizontal. A heavy object is placed in the center of the membrane, displacing it. This is a model of a perturbation. This analogy has two salient features. First, the amount of displacement of any part of the membrane is greatest close to the object and least far 361 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="32">away. Second, the occurrence of displacement is immediate and simulta- neous in all parts of the membrane. This contrasts with the wave analo- gy, in which the effect of the perturbation travels outward from the source. These features of the drum analogy are both consistent with the present findings. In Experiment 3 the judged change was greatest in the first time period, judged not only at one link distant but also at two and three links distant (see Table 6), supporting the idea of simultaneous and immediate effects. And in all experiments the judged change was greatest for species closest to the perturbation and least for those fur- thest away. The findings of Experiment 2 are also consistent with the drum analogy. Dissipation fails to occur in the two-species condition because, no matter how many time periods are involved, participants never had to judge species further than one link away from the pertur- bation. In the seven-species condition judgments are made about a spe- cies six links away from the perturbation and the size of the change judged is smaller, just as the displacement of the membrane is less far- ther away from the heavy object. Distant parts of the membrane are less displaced because they are more affected by their proximity to the rim of the drum. This limits their capacity to be moved, depending on the elasticity of the membrane. A food web has no rim, of course, but it does have structural features that could mediate the same function. One is simply the number of species that lie between the species in question and the location of the pertur- bation. Thus, we could imagine that the judged change to a species is some function of the size of the perturbation divided by the number of intervening species. If this is the case, then it suggests a particular kind of understanding of complex physical systems. Under this account, people do not simply judge a unidirectional chain of influence from a perturbation through the food web. Instead, they judge that the effect of a perturbation is moderated by the rest of the food web. In other words, although people may not model feedback processes, they may nevertheless model a kind of interactive process involving a contest between opposing forces. At distances greater from the perturbation, the balance tips increasingly in favor of forces resisting change (analo- gous to the rim of the drum), so that the effect of the perturbation is judged to be smaller. Such a model is capable of generating predictions: The judged effect at a particular distance from a perturbation should depend on the struc- tural properties of the web, such as the number of intervening species, that determine the strength of the resistance to change. Future exper- iments could test the model by manipulating such features independent- ly of number of links distant. 362 WHITE</page><page sequence="33">In conclusion, the dissipation effect is a robust phenomenon. Under- standing the reasons for the occurrence of the dissipation effect is im- portant not only for the scientific investigation of causal cognition, particularly with regard to cognition about complex physical systems, but also for the practical and educational implications relating to our human interventions in natural processes. The present experiments have shown that the effect is closely associated with the structure of food webs, and point the way to future research in which structural features are manipulated.
