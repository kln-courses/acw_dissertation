<plain_text><page sequence="1">STANLEY PLUMLY Chapter And Verse A Special APR Supplement Stanley Plumly's latest book of poetry is Out-of-the-Body Travel (Ecco/Viking). This essay, and its second half which will appear in the next APR, is part of a work-in-progress of the same title. APOLOGIA What follows is the first half of an extended essay or meditation on some recent work by younger American poets. The attendant theory, speculation, or whatever, is the result of that reading. This initial selec tion concerns free verse as a forum for rhetoric and emotion. The second half will look at the new formality of a poetry of emblem and image. To the inevitable question the inevitable answer. The books have been selected from materials at hand, nothing older than 1976 publication. Nothing I have reviewed or will review has been included. -S.P. ONE Rhetoric and Emotion i If tone is one way, historically, of describing the voice within and of a poem, then rhetoric is the way tone of voice is achieved. Rhetoric ought to be no more or less than the presence of the poet, made manifest, in his poem. The poet's voice, his way of presiding over his material, whether the intention is to inspire or illuminate, whether the terms are those of a persona or one of a trinity of personal pronouns, is inevitable. The ques tion is never one of the fact of a voice but of the effective control or dis closure of that voice. There is of course no such thing as omniscience in poetry. The point of view is always limited, someone is always speaking. The speech, though, should be dramatic, not pontifical, should be less heard than overheard. More recently the test of a good poem has come down to the relative believability or authenticity of its voice, its rhetoric, often at the expense of more traditional tests. Indeed, too much time spent at the verbal surface could, according to such a reading, compro mise the possible depth of statement. At the extreme, craft?insofar as a revisionist art is concerned?has come to be regarded as a Republican vir tue. And rhetoric, in the pejorative, has come to mean something crafty, a con. Yet looking back just a few years to Black Mountain, the Beats, the Sixties surrealists, the Confessionals, each was identified by a partic ular rhetoric. Back almost two hundred years, at the point of entry into the Industrial consciousness, preface to Lyrical Ballads declared poetry's independence from the neo-classical decorum of the eighteenth century. A little over a century later, Andre Breton, in his surrealist Manifesto, sought to free and redirect the energies of the imagination by rewriting its assumptions. Rhetoric, whatever the year and whatever the aesthetic, establishes credentials, identifies voice. Rhetoric also releases. If there is a general difference among younger poets today it is a difference of rhetorical sources: those who write out of an emotional imperative and those who write from an emblematic com mitment. The latter are represented in the second half of this piece. As to imperatives, Marilyn Hacker ("I still balk at my preference for rhyme.") is as intimate and intense as anyone writing, even if she still disguises herself as a formalist. Stanley Plumly photo by Henry CarlUe The umber dowagers of Henry Street gossip from windows while they rest their feet: The Jew on East Broadway sells rotten fruit. Last night the cops busted a prostitute; broke up a crap game in the hall next door woke up the kids almost half past four. As taken with the ripened fall of words against the yard as what they saw or heard, their voices scoop the sun like beautiful harsh birds, until the cindered yard is dull with evening, and the regularities of grubby men and children home to eat. Two laminated toucans pepper meat as sunlight sheaths behind the sumac trees. The sonnet is labeled ''September," the time of the year and certainly a metaphor for the time of day. There is just a little of the Brahmin perspec tive (Cummings' Cambridge and Lowell's Boston) of being slightly above it all, off to one side, sorting and selecting, judging. An odd but effective angle for the material. The engineering of the poem is everywhere appar ent and is supposed to be, and in surrendering point of view to perspective Hacker has apparently lifted herself out of involvement. Yet the mode of this sonnet is dramatic, a piece of storytelling, rather than argumenta tive, it is rendered rather than reasoned through. And the wrist-rapping strictness of the rhythm and rhyme, the acceleration of some lines posed against the abruptness of others, and the authority of detail all suggest anything but aloofness. The events of the poem are obviously witnessed or we would not care. By increasing the level of energy the engineering only serves to intensify the rhetoric and our awareness of a voice. The speaker is simply off-stage, with more freedom to play with diction and detail than she might have were she a part of the action. In fact, had the poem been written in terms of an T the potential for sentimentality would have been enormous. There are too many other people and too j much going on in the poem for the poet to take it personally: the passion j m M January/February 1978 Pa&amp;* 21</page><page sequence="2">would have gone soft. By staying out of it Hacker is that much more be lievably involved. That is the success of her tone, where the voice is call ing from. Dave Smith takes a longer look in "The Perspective and Limits of Snapshots"?and into the past but only superficially into the pastoral. Here is the first third of the poem. Aubrey Bodine 's crosswater shot of Menchville, Virginia: a little dream composing a little water, specifically, the Deep Creek flank of the Warwick. Two-man oyster scows lie shoulder to shoulder, as if you walked them, one land to another, no narrow channel hidden in the glossy middle like a blurred stroke, current grinning at hulls. It is an entirely eloquent peace, with lolling ropes and liquid glitter, this vision of traffic and no oystermen in sight Clearly, Bodine is not Matthew Brady catching the trenchant gropes frozen at Fredericksburg with a small black box. So well he has excluded the neat Mennonite church, yachts, country club pool, the spare smell of dignity seeps. Perhaps it is because of the zoom on the teeth of the oyster tongs; perhaps it is after all Sunday. The action picks up later in the poem, as does the writing. The rhetoric for now is mostly commentary ("It is an entirely eloquent peace"), punc tuated with clues ("with lolling/ropes and liquid glitter"). It reads like ex position, as if the poet were setting-up the scene, the complication. In fact, the poet is trying to establish his voice, get control of his presence in the poem, in order to mediate between point of view and the story being told. Smith is better with Bodine, whose snapshot he is presently inter preting, than with Brady, whose picture he is remembering: "trenchant gropes frozen/at Fredericksburg" is clogged phrasing and seeing, with none of the economy of vision he is praising Bodine for. Yet in the total? and Smith is a poet who demands to be read on the whole?the effect of the stanza is one of detail not only selected and seen but voiced-over, cared for. The side-step of the "you" in the fifth Une is more anonymous than named; Smith is referring to the reader as much as to himself. The story continues. Above the last boat, the flat-faced store squats at the end of the dirt road as if musing over accounts receivable. No doubt it has weathered years of blood spilling. A spotted hound Hfts his nose above what must be yesterday's trash fish, his white coat luminous against deep foilage. What Bodine fails to see is the dog turning to lope uphill under that screen of poplars, behind fat azale?s that hide the county farm and tke*drtMks pressed against wire screens, sniffing the James. "No doubt," the speaker says of the store's "weathered/years of blood spilling." And not content to comment, to interpret the limits of snap shots, he tells us what Bodine "fails to see." The fictional device here is interesting in that, one, it admits the basis for the technique of order in the poem, and two, it fixes the relationship between the speaker and his material. The actual story lies outside the snapshot, as we shall see; and the speaker is really a narrator, a storyteller who needs to read into and past the limits of the "flat-face" picture. The dog leads us out of the frame into the outside, as-yet-unphotographed world of county farms and drunks in the lock-up. Smith concludes his poem with an incident, an incident and truth too large for the perspective and limits of snap shots, an incident added to fulfill the function of the narrator?to com plete the still-life with context, the third dimension. One oysterman thumped his noisy wife (the window was accidental) because she had a knife and mourned their boy twenty years drown?d. If he knew Bodine stood at the marsh tip where his boy dove, if he were but told a camera yawned to suck in the years of his worst sailing shame, he would turn away. He would whistle up boys in the dust that is dignity and if he could he would spit in his hand and tell his nameless black cellmate there are many men for whom the world is. neither oyster nor pearl Now the narrator has made his photograph, organized and interpreted from the parallel, "real" world. Two pictures, then, one, Bodine's, placed inside the other. As in Hacker's sonnet, the actual T has been circum vented, but unlike the observer's role in "September," Smith's voice pre sides as a participant, to the extent that he can believably make assump tions about the inner life of his oysterman. Smith's story has moved through the closed space of the original photograph, commenting and placing clues ("no oystermen in sight//years of blood spilling//drunks/ pressed against wire screens") to the surrounding space of the outside world, a world too various and dangerous for the eye of a single camera. The success of Smith's tone of voice is that through his use of a narrator he is able to be intimate without being familiar. He begins at the shoulder of Bodine sighting crosswater at Menchville and ends standing beside his oysterman in a cell. A trip like that takes time, much more than fourteen lines, with a sense of open-endedness and continuum. So Hacker is right in tying up her scene with couplets, however loose the knots, and Smith is right to allow his story the full play of the page. Hacker's means are implicit, Smith's explicit. If occasionally Smith's lines seem to be widen ing toward prose, then so much the better for his method. He is compet ing with fiction, after all, in a prose that scans. When he alliterates like a poet is when he is most in trouble. "The spare smell of dignity seeps..." If it does, it should not. The closing incident of the oysterman is the best written because it is the most deeply felt moment in the poem. In its use of repetition and measure, in its directness of phrase it is as well written, as Pound would say, as prose. Both Hacker and Smith work the language hard, often enough to the point where their voices embellish more than they engage the material. For the reader, the tone of a poem is very much based on trust, what he is willing or not willing to believe. No good reader is going to stay long to listen to self-indulgence. Marilyn Hacker, for instance, has a habit of pursuing analogy to the absurd em hurry up, my guts convulse for love, though I have only seen your neck, your wrist, your lapis eyes worn underneath black lace. You will be stone on me, remind me of marble and amber, quartz and amethyst while I taste my tongue corrode your face. This lapidary passion far y our face... O hurry up please, it's time. The obsession here could have humor if the reader could find reason to trust a countervailing irony. "You will be stone on me" is good, but it is lost to silly and predictable metaphor.(guess the line that follows the ellipsis: "could crystallize into a kind of love") pushed at us in the extreme?and lost to the gratuities of the late, late show: "I taste my tongue corrode your face." The remainder of the son net is no better, nor the overwhelming clue of the title, "Stones, Jewels." If the metaphor of the 6ody-into-stone is meant to suggest separation, then it is done much more convincingly throughout the rest of Hacker's book. Separations, a second collection, is obviously a title intended to es tablish far more than the terms of the poet's domestic relations: in the book's best poems, those in which the rhetoric and the emotion arrive to gether, separation describes her state of being. In "After the Revolu tion," "The Companion," for example, and in the title sequence, a veritable trauma-drama of sonnets, Hacker achieves the magnitude she is after?a sort of personal moral outrage, levied on scale, with discipline. For all her form and feathers, she is a street poet, a ranter. She is also incredibly pro fessional. So that by the time she gets to the page negotiations have been or are about to be worked out between the emotional imperatives and the demands of the art. Insofar as it makes a difference she writes free verse in rhyme. Dave Smith has simpler problems. His rhetoric sometimes outruns the action, as if to compensate. It must be like entering a world where every breath turns dead reckless and pure as gull song tuned by nothing but ribbed sealight, where hard-headed laid-down fathers rise up slowly among crocus and bluebell as if only minutes before sleep whined like a gnat The antecedent for "It" is fiddling, as in a buck-dancer's choice. The lan guage has suddenly fallen in love with its own music, and the imitative effect is literary rather than real. There are four similes attached to two metaphors that are themselves related to an outside, it, referent. Images should provide windows, not mirrors. Cumberland Station, Smith's third full volume, is a book filled with large .and large-minded poems, most of which are successful, most of which?such as the title poem and "Look ing for the Melungeon" and "On a Field Trip to Fredericksburg" as in stances?illustrate a remarkably stratified Southern rhetoric building through plot. Looming is Smith's own metaphor for the process familiar to seamen that makes "distant objects appear larger, in opposition to the general law of vision, by which they are diminished." Wh?n the size of the object is appropriately gaged by the size of his language. Smith's poems tell powerful stories. He wastes himself on a lot of writing-about-subjects ("The Sex of Poetry," "The Palmreader," "Coming Attractions"), play ing at a wit that rings false. He sometimes succumbs to his influences, Dickey and James Wright. But when he sticks to local business, his Tide water Virginia sources, his full-bodied rhetoric is unique, even antique. If Hacker looks formal, Smith appears to be four-square. Both of them read out of fashion. Neither of them, however, seems completely comfort able in the close patterns they have set for themselves. And though the discomfort may be the chief positive tension in their work, the aesthetic order feels more often imposed than inherent. For Hacker it comes down to a predictability of rhythm, for Smith it is the prolixity of the line. They both seem to be looking for some third form, a vers libre, to relieve the burden of habit, to open the opportunities toward something not quite prose. II So-called free verse has been around a long time?all the way back to the Psalms. Still, as a form of poetry practiced by individual poets, it is really an invention of the nineteenth century and an inspiration to the Page 22 ne American Poetry Review</page><page sequence="3">twentieth. It is as various in nature as its practitioners, whether one be gins with W.E. Henley, Arnold, or. Whitman, or a century later with James Wright, Louis Simpson, or Galway Kinnell, or even Ted Hughes, to stick to English-speaking examples. Indeed, variety is exactly the point of free verse. As a phrase the term is as unfortunate as it is inaccu rate. It sounds like a revolt against archetypical Victorian conformity, when in fact it is an aesthetic alternative generalized along with historic changes in the other arts. Impressionism and atonal music, for example, began as freed verse. As individuals vary in its use, so do generations. One could doubtless devote an essay, if not a book, to delineating the con temporary relationship between the free verse of a given time and the po etry written in fixed forms. Surely they are not unrelated. The Eliot of Four Quartets and the Yeats of The Tower write out of a similar cultural context. In our time, the paternal generation, almost to the man or woman, has summarized within a whole work the growth from the formal to the "free." Richard Howard's Alone with America is a catalogue of such careers, ranging from John Ashbery to W.S. Merwin to Adrienne Rich to James Wright. The continuum in the work of each is clear, but so is the change. One critic has described free verse as a kind of soliloquy, thinking out loud. Perhaps. But it is hardly a speech made up on the spot. It is more likely a profoundly different rhythm, lying somewhere between the dis cursive and the metrical, between the quantitative advantages of prose and the qualitative of poetry. Free verse is really flexible verse, whether it rhymes by accident or measures a line now and then, whether it is Life Studies* or The North American Sequence, or whether it descends the page in the shape of a riprap. Younger poets, including Hacker and Smith, have taken the rhetorical tradition of free verse and turned it more and more inward, in the direction of the personal and associational?not to confess but to share in one another's dream-life. Even the stated T is now less specified: what is important is the emotional or emblematic center of gravity, the sense that the poet has consulted his source more k directly than himself. (The era of the great egos ended with Berryman.) The tone has become more intimate as the territory has become more de tailed, discrete, named. All of this makes for a poetry at once more re sponsive and potentially irresponsible, as if each event, each experience had its own free verse equivalent in form. The problem being in finding it. Eliot is fond of writing things like, "As for 'free verse', I expressed my This essay was written before Robert Lowell's tragic death.

KENNEDY by Sidney Krome "I found the poem moving." - William Cole "a grand job-poignant...stirring." - Fred R. MacFadden, Coppin State College Send $2.50 per copy to: CHARLES PRESS, Box 10485, Bal to., Md. 21209 view twenty-five years ago by saying that no verse is free for the man who wants to do a good job," and in the next breath adding, "The music of poetry, then, must be a music latent in the common speech of its time." The two comments complement rather than contradict each other. Latent in the common speech of its time reads like a rewrite of something Words worth says in his Preface about the voice of a good poem being in a lan guage "spoken by men"?indeed in a language in which there is "no es sential difference between prose and metrical composition." The differ ence, though, as Eliot states, is in the music, though that difference is to be distinguished within a common speech-^not in a separate speech for poetry and one for prose. The point may seem commonplace, yet there are a substantial number of poets who still operate in a realm of imperial dic tion. The patterns of formal poetry, regardless of the variability within the line, tend to emphasize the linear, a going across the page. Hacker's sonnet, "September," for all its common speech, offers line breaks of a^ fairly predictable nature, and the rhyme only reinforces the line-length. The patterns in free verse, however, tend to emphasize the vertical move ment of the poem, a going down the, page. Perhaps the term 'music' is really a prosody word limited in its metaphor. 'Pace' would better des cribe the passage by which a free verse poem, whatever the length of its line, breaks and enjambs, stops and restarts its way down. There may be few real differences in diction between free and formal verse (at least there should not be), but there are real differences in rhythm?although, finally, the differences may relate more to rhyme, or rhyme schemes, than to the internal music of the line. So-called free verse should scan too?it might even, in its own off-handed way, rhyme internally, but it must not schematize the rhythm or the possible rhyme. The prosody of free verse is the prosody of assonance, consonance, and surprise. What has happened in the seventies is that as free verse has become the norm, it has become refined, more various, and more abused. At its flexible best, it calls less and less attention to the language and more to tjje body of the action. Ideally, to quote Louis Simpson, its language should be transparent. One is tempted, as others have been, to see the language as the clothing of a poem, ranging in taste from what one wears at Court to what one wears to bed. But the "body," naked or not, "of the action" ought not be limited to the anthropomorphic. Traditional verse, in its most formal circumstance, has typically turned its action into an argument. Free verse, even in its iambic phase, beginning with The Pre lude, has let the action speak for itselfrand invariably narrative has been involved, either as the whole story or parts thereof. As a genre of under a hundred lines, free verse has come to mean the dramatic lyric, an intensi fied, implicative action. What makes that action convincing or authentic is the tone of its master's voice. Tone is what we ?re left with once the language assumes transparency. But there is a mind as well as a body to the action. And together, whole, in terms of voice print, fingerprint, phrenology, and shadow on the wall, they probably should look and sound a lot like the person of the poet. The point of a poem declaring its freedom as verse is that it somehow better represent the individuality?no, the personality of things, the meta physics of the action, and who is presiding. Such a poem might represent more than a life in either crisis or transition or introspection, more than a life in simple action: but a moment in or out of time, "while the music lasts," a moment as a synthesis of memory and present tense, of experi ence and experiment. If the lyric is the fragment of our time, then tone is its authenticating means. The poet would convince us that the piece he is giving us is not from whole cloth but from the total fabric. Without the self-appointed skills the formalist can display, the free verse poet is*es pecially vulnerable to questions of credentials. The tone of his voice, as it brings together what is happening with why it is happening, as it gives thought to the emotion, as it calls more and more attention to the person behind the performance, must pass some feirly tough tests as to what is true as well as what is beautiful. So Emerson, Wordsworth's intellectual contemporary, is precisely on the mark, as he defends yet another Transcendentalist assumption: "For it is not metres, but a metre-making argument, 4hat makes a poem,?a thought so passionate and alive that, like the spirit of a plant or animal, it has an architecture of its own, and adorns nature with a new thing. The thought and the form are equal in the order of time, but in the order of genesis the thought is prior to the form." Had Emerson regarded his own feeling-life less nervously, he might have at least included the idea of emotion as an element equal and apriori to the form, and had he lived after Einstein he might have included space as an order with time. Frost, Wordsworth's heir, and ever practical, looks to rhythm and what it repre sents, its mind as well as its body, in the category of the sentence rather than the line: "A dramatic necessity goes deep into the nature of the sen tence. Sentences are not different enough to hold the attention unless they are dramatic. All that can save them is the speaking tone of voice somehow entangled in the words..." If free verse is beginning to sound like irregular blank verse, with a particular emphasis on its correspon dence with its sources, its ability to represent the apriori emotion and thought in a rhythm and texture as close to a sense of the original experi ence as possible, well... This would mean representing an action, dra matically, in sentences: which would mean representing an actor, the speaking voice, one who would normally participate in as well as preside over the action. Perhaps free verse has become the language of the tribe, and the tone of its intrinsic voice is what we hear coming from the tribe's most totemic, intimate imagination, the speaker in a dream. January/February 1978 Page 23</page><page sequence="4">III When Coleridge makes his famous distinction between poetry and prose it seems a most precise and precious one. What is, after all, the real difference between the best words in their best order and just words in their best order?'A profound difference, of course?all the difference re quired. Difference enough, in fact, to determine rhythm. And to Cole ridge, as to Wordsworth and Emerson and Eliot, that distinction?of the "musical phrase," as Pound called it?is absolute. Prose has no prosody. And poetry?though it may not tick like a metronome or decorate nor in flate, must make music. For all the approaches to free verse, from Whit man to Williams, from Ginsberg to The Book of Nightmares, it has been described more by approximation than definition. It has nearly always re mained stuck somewhere between the positive pole of poetry and the negative pole of prose. It has been what they are, hybrid or separate, but not quite. It may turn out that free verse is a third form, a genre unto itself, a pattern apart from, if related to, other patterns. If it is not quite poetry in its formal arrangement, it is certainly not prose in its formal ap pearance. To paraphrase Coleridge, it may be simply the best action in its best order?an action less dependent on line breaks than on the sen tence, yet an action more determined by stanzas than by the paragraph. Yes, an action committed to the rhythm of the story as it is received, as it is perceived. An action whose voice is more sensitive to nuance and source, and therefore more vulnerable. For example, take a "Time Lapse with Tulips." That kiss meant to sear my heart forever it went right by And the way we walked out on Sundays to the bakery like a very old couple, arm on arm, that's gone too though the street had a house with a harp in the window. Those tulips again. They think if they keep being given away by the black-haired man at our wedding I will finally take them in time for the photograph. But they are wrong. This time I will hand them back or leave them sitting in the mason jar on the grass beside you. See how the guests lean after me, their mouths slightly open. Only now it's plain they were never sure, that the picture holding us all preserves a symmetry of doubt with us at the center, the pledge of tulips red agains t my dress. This poem from Tess Gallagher's first book, Instructions to the Double, may not be typical of the musculature and heavy metaphor so vigorous in so many of her pieces. In a wonderful tossed-off sort of poem such as "The Horse in the Drugstore" (excerpted here), the imagination and music perform more obvious feats of free verse? ...itis enough to stand so with his polished chest among the nipples and bibs, the cotton and multiple sprays, with his black Ups parted just slightly and the forehooves doubled back in the lavender air. He has learned here when maligned to snort dimes and to carry the inscrutable bruise like a bride. The Alexandrine length of Une between the quarter rhyme of nipples/lips is kept fairly busy with its i's and Ts and s's, not to mention its bilabials. The black/back rhyme is neatly buried too, ending the next Une. But the closing two Unes best illustrate how image can be blessed by music and still remain in the speaking rather than a singing voice. "Lavender air" may be an obivious aural combination; yet when extended, after a fuU stop, to "here" it becomes more interesting, especially cpmpUcated by the assonant-consonant sounds of "learned...when maligned.../dimes." The abruptness of "to snort" is just the appropriate interruption for the long i's and I's built around it and headed into "inscrutable bniise Uke a bride." There is even formaUty here, with at least five acb?nts a Une, the length itself made longer by units of unstressed syllables. No, "Time Lapse with Tulips" makes very few of these overt gestures toward the musical phrase?or toward the high gloss of metaphor, for that matter. Instead, it offers the reader apparently less and ultimately more. It be gins, modestly enough, in m?dias res, in the past tense, and moves, after a time lapse, to immediate speculation about the position of some tuUps in a wedding picture, and concludes with the photograph itself. The poem is unified by situation, then, and more particularly by the framing idea of the photograph. Moreover, as in most poems in open form, this one de pends on the growth of a clear leitmotif?from the searing kiss itself, a red kiss, to the shape of the harp in the window, to the central image of the tuUps (the puii is surely no mistake), to the open mason jar, to "their mouths/sUghtly open," and back to the tuUps, by now red. The "plot," however, the cause-and-effect of things, is what finaUy holds bur atten tion. We begin right in the middle of the old mutabiUty theme ("that's gone too"), oddly enough in the simple past tense?oddly, because in terms of the emotional Ufe proposed the events in the first stanza seem to have occurred after the wedding picture, an event even further in the past, yet an event spoken of here in the present. We are dealing, of course, with the time lapse in the speaker's head: the first stanza is expository, a set-up, memory; then the keying-in on the single, suggestive object, "those tulips again"?again because of the memories at the beginning?and so the story becomes complicated, what to do with those tulips; and then, in the last stanza, the story is completed though entirely open to "a sym metry of doubt"?for the guests, the tulips, for the couple, the marriage. The poem teases us with ambiguities, the least of which is whether or not those tulips really are to be in the wedding photo ("But they are wrong"// "the pledge/of tulips red against my dress"). "With us at the center," says the speaker, of the " symmetry of doubt" comes confirmation of the chief ambiguity?"This time," those tulips again, and likely again, on into the indefinite future. "The picture/holding us all preserves/a sym metry of doubt" is more poetic than actual paradox; it is part of the speech of the poem. But "This time I will hand them back or leave them" is "at the center" of the story. Like the kiss, like the harp in the window, the tulips, beautiful as they are, are destined to change, to reinact the old est cliche in poetry. There is a difference, though. Of course we cannot fix in time what is fluid: neither can the wedding picture, however well it frames the couple and the guests. The tulips, however, are not exactly in the picture, only the "pledge/of tulips red against my dress." The tulips are in "this time," where they can be handed back or left sitting in the mason jar. Perhaps fluidity simply means a life-time series of photo graphs of death, and so those tulips, "sitting in the maSon jar/on the grass beside you," are as much of that process as "you" are, and as the speaker is. Obviously they are: and that is their "symbolic" value. Red is both the color of love and death. So far, extrapolated, those tulips are fairly familiar stuff, time lapsed or time out of time. But earlier, right at the start, before we come to "Those tulips again," we are offered "that kiss," that particular one, "meant to sear my heart forever." Of course, dash, dash, "it went right by." Galla gher classifies her realities according to time lapse; she is being coy. It went right by accelerates time considerably. And it suggests that more is invovled here than just another chance for carpe diem. The poem is very much about the living, not the dead, about the inherent human flaw in hu man relationships?us at the center of a symmetry of doubt, doubt about life, perhaps, doubt about marriage, yes. Still fairly familiar stuff, that people fail, and that they are failing even at the moment of purest suc cess. The photograph tells us that. What is most individual about this poem is hardly its theme, but its tone, the feel of the thing, its total ef fect, from the sound of the voice to where the voice is calling from. Again and again, Gallagher breaks up combinations that might remind us of the verbal dexterity of "The Horse in the Drugstore" in order to minimize the music. The last line, for instance, reads sweeter as "the pledge of tulips red against my dress"; the whole last stanza, in fact, could easily be rearranged down to five lines by simple extensions of lines into fuller units. The same with the preceeding stanzas?and without loss to the symmetry of the poem. Certain vowel and consonant sounds would be en hanced by a consistently longer line. But also "enhanced," and also ex aggerated, would be the emotional life of the poem. "Time Lapse with Tulips" cannot afford to iron out its edges. Place "it went right by" on the first line with the dash and the effect is funny. Move "in the window" up with the house and the harp loses emphasis; move the harp down with the window and the two lines syncopate. The angles as Gallagher has fashioned them provide the voice with the appropriate tension: they un derstate the rhythm, and the emotion. Indeed, they function ironically against what might be expected. More than that, the relative variation of line length (a symmetry of doubt) helps increase the pace of the poem down the page, helps, in a word, to authenticate the action?an action that seems to begin in the middle of the story and go backwards, into history, through and into time, but that really moves through space, as if ?in spite of tense?all the parts of the poem exist simultaneously. In the speaker's mind, in the time lapse, they do. The emotion has been brought to bear on this single moment, worked out in its single voice. Tone is more exposed in free verse^since the rhetoric of open forms is supposed to call less attention to itself. The voice is more available and therefore more vulnerable. Although there may not be enough hard evi dence about American poetry since the sixties, tone seems to have dis placed the image as a "technique of discovery." As young poets especially have become more personal, more intimate with their material and less and less committed to experience in capital letters, so have the terms become more particularized, more relative. This shift in emphasis calls for a free verse more flexible than ever, one that is able, most of alt, to ac commodate a wider, more detailed, even contradictory range of emotional experience?yes, accommodate and control. Tess Gallagher's "Tulips" orders its action as much around what is left out as what is left in. She reaches in all directions at once, still in doubt. The emotional evidence, though, by the time we get to that "picture/holding us all," adds up. To have reversed the order of the action, to have begun with the actual wed ding picture, would of course have been sentimental?a surrender of con trol, an imbalance to the equilibrium of elements. "Those tulips again." One can hardly personify let alone rescue the cliche of those flowers (in a wedding photo to boot) without a careful delineation and organization of materials?without putting things right, in a sequence that best authen ticates the emotion. That is what real rhetoric in free verse is about: the best words in their best order in their best order of action, a going down Page 24 Th American Poetry Review</page><page sequence="5">as well as across the page. The special accretive, vertical power of the free verse poem is very much the issue in David St. John's poem for his son. The way a tired Chippewa woman Who 's lost a child gathers up black feathers, Black quills &amp; leaves That she wraps &amp; swaddles in a little bale, a shag Cocoon she carries with her &amp; speaks to always As if it were the child, Until she knows the soul has grown fat &amp; clever, That the child can find its own way at last; Well, I go everywhere Picking the dust out of the dust, scraping the breezes Up off the floor, &amp; gather them into a doll Of you, to touch at the nape of the neck, to slip Under my shirt like a rag?the way Another man 's wallet rides above his heart. As you Cry out, as if calling to a father you conjure In the paling light, the voice rises, instead, in me. Nothing stops it, the crying. Not the clove of moon, Not the woman raking my back with her words. Our letters Close. Sometimes, you ask About the world; sometimes, I answer back. Nights Return you to me fora while, as sleep returns sleep To a landscape ravaged &amp; familiar. The dark watermark of your absence, a hush. This is no elegy, but it is elegiac; it does dramatize loss, "the dark water mark" of an absence. It is no accident that the last word is also the po em's title?in the text, another metaphor for loss; as a title, the name of the whole. Hush does not simply understate the terms of the emotional argu ment, it is the term of the argument itself. Hush is the voice in which the poem is written, the attitude of the speaker toward the material: an atti tude that must be prepared for, organized toward, an attitude that is finally a form of irony in that the hush is effective only in proportion to the emotional extreme it implies. St. John's poem is not sentimental, yet it depends on the full cup to spilling-over. "Nothing stops it, the cry ing": St. John's problem and potential for power is to surround such a statement with sufficient context to save it. The tone of the poem's voice is what is achieved as it builds toward its last word?not what may be imposed by the assumption of its title. How is "Hush" built? St. John, first-book poet that he is, has been called both surrealist and sentimentalist. In the early sixties such a com bination of self-consciousness and sincerity led Donald Hall to conclude, in his fine and now famous introduction to Contemporary American Po etry, that there was indeed something new going on, post-Eliot. Ronald Moran and George Lensing, in an essay in The Southern Review of that period, called it the "emotive imagination," this sense that American poetry had turned an important corner. And so it had. Nothing said or written since has had the aesthetic impact of say Robert Bly's commen taries and James Wright's poetry of those years. (A poet like W.S. Mer win closes the period.) The sixties opened up not only the idea of the image, but the source of that imagination as well?a source, for those will ing to subscribe, located somewhere in the life of the unconscious. What Hall and others were observing, Bly and others were promoting. Bly's favorite term for the correspondence between the deep image and the sur face was association. It is a good word, a useful word, though it is a meta phor for a metaphor. The issues of Bly's poetics and politics are beside the point here, and anyone reading this essay should be familiar with his program, developed over two and a half decades of editing and writing for Fifties/Sixties/Seventies. (It is no coincidence that both he and Pound be gan their respective assaults with re-evaulations of the iniage.) The cor rective balance the seventies have provided for the influences of the six ties is to remind us that the image alone has no voice. (Indeed, as one example, except for his Silence in the Snowy Fields, Robert Bly is largely tone-deaf. So much of his work reads and sounds as if the poet were mere ly the mediator between the unconscious and a hostile world. If there is a voice, it is the voice of the oracle, ear to the ground.) The image is only as effective as its dramatic context, the langauge, the rhetoric it is carried by. The associations take place on the page: that is to say, they are an nounced: they are, by implicit or explicit means, made to connect there. The several images of a poem may have no literal center of gravity, but they should have a coherency, a unity of voice, of tone of voice, behind them. That voice is their chief authority, both in terms of control and authenticity. It establishes the emotional and imaginative individuality of the speaker of the poem, even if he or she is a dream-speaker. Image should be the vital evidence of the emotion, as tone is the vital voice of that emotion. How is David St. John's poem built? By a kind of analogy, of course; by a series, a sequence of images. The success of the poem is dependent on the order and timing of the sequence as much as on the quality of the images themselves. At least that is one level of success. Perhaps more to the point of free verse as an expressive form is the rhythm of the presenta tion. One thing to always bear in mind about free verse, as suggested earlier, is that the line breaks are more eye than ear oriented. The unit of the sentence, as in good, scanable prose, is the ear of the free verse poem. So that more than half of "Hush"?the first half?is a single protracted sentence, varied in Une length for emphasis. The Unes do not enjamb so much as they anticipate, moving as easily as possible to keep the voice quiet, in control. That first long sentence is really a stanza, closed. It ends as it began, with a clear rhetorical signal about what is coming: the way. And is interrupted, conversationally, with a well Those small words, functioning as they do to establish the presence of the speaker in relationship to the image, provide aural context?and transition. Poems of high emotional content seem to call for cause-and-effect connection a$ opposed to juxtaposition. They need to happen in the sequence of a story being told. Once the deflections?"a shag/cocoon," "a doll/of you," "An other man's wallet"?have been set up, St. John can then get to the actu al matter at hand, the absent son, the absent father. The poet plays with the device of the simile beyond its convenience. We know that "as if call ing to a father" is no as if?that absence is the condition of things here. The phrase "the way" is another form of as if; by its very circumvention it takes us to the center of the problem. The irony in the use of analogous clues and the unexpected, and totally unrelated, nature of those clues (the Chippewa woman, another man's wallet) helps St. John to "stay off his subject," as Richard Hugo once put it. Building his story, he is building his tone. Building it so that the "climax"?the point at which the hush is most called into question?comes long before the end. "In the paling light, the voice rises, instead, in me." The seven lines that continue and conclude the poem accelerate in rhythm through repetition and parallel ism. They serve to intensify without exaggerating the emotion. In their several sentences they move at a speed in considerable contrast to the wandering of the first, long sentence. "As if it were the child," St. John says of the Indian woman talking to her "little bale." The dead child, we are to assume. The success of St. John's tone is that he has written, convincingly, an elegy for the living. On assignment, that is very sentimental stuff. But step by step, he has understated and rescued the situation. Both father and child, separately, are memory. The old attack on free verse would speak of it as spilled prose, something a poet had to do in lieu of skill. Prose or prose-poem, spilled or joined together, such categorizations no longer distinguish the issue. Free verse is of course the form of our time?though to paraphrase Pound, it mtist be as well written as prosody. It is a different, more ex pressive music. As distinctions of genre blur, the seventies may reveal that poetry in general and prose in particular have more than a lot in com mon. Free verse, at least, as the illustrations of Gallagher and St. John, and even Hacker and Smith, show, has for a long time not had to prove its virtue in a sinful world.

Perhaps we should not be talking about prose relative to po etry, but fiction relatives free verse. What we want is a whole poem, not perfected pieces of the poet's workshop. A poem that surrounds its "subject," that completes its emotional arc?a poem that tells us enough of the story that why it was written is implicated in what it says. "Hush" is a whole poem, a poem that enlarges, not simply one that grows. Its "fiction" exists in the protagonist-antagonist relationship be tween the speaking father and the indirect speech of the son. If it does not engage the complete story as in the plotted prose of say five to ten thousand words, it does embrace a whole emotion, it does offer what Pound calls "an absolute rhythm?a poetry which corresponds exactly to the emotion being expressed." This sense of fullness, of something being worked out and worked through, relative to the length of passage, rela ~Kv? to the timing of the particulars, is what the voice in free verse is all about. First-book poets are invariably inconsistent. St. John's Hush, like Tess Gallagher's Instructions, is no exception. The best work of both poets keeps company with their least. St. John's weakness is precisely opposed to his strength: in his first section, for instance, there is a run of five po ems, from "Ruins" to "Oranges," that depends more on white space than substance. They read like practice, warm-up exercises to the larger, bril liantly filled-out pieces that follow. My words disappear, like gravel tossed in a lake sinking through the pages of water. The metaphorical conversion here is easy to the point of cliche, and it concludes a short poem that is already the tag-end of experience we must guess at. Its profoundity is fey?as fey as its source is unaccounted for. "The amber window, dark again." "I lean in the doorway,/and slide my fingers along/the rosewood neck." "I go out on the porch/and watch a firefly weave/through the pines?lost Saint,/stone lantern, looking/for the way." The poems in this group are obviously early poems, without the depth of texture and situation required to believe in their theologies. They have simply not earned their gestures. Thankfully five or so poems are not the representative number in a book sustained by some of the best writing around. Yet such young work does illustrate the indulgence COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY THE WRITING STAFF FOR 1978-1979 Louise Gl?ck Gail Godwin Frank MacShane Joseph McElroy Scott Momaday Toni Morrison Hannah Green Daniel Halpern Stephen Koch Stanley Kunitz Carol Muske Stanley Plumly Charles Wright COURSES OFFERED: Fiction, Poetry, Non-Fiction, Mod ern European Poetry, Translation, Reviewing, Readings in Contemporary Poetry &amp; Fiction, and Publishing WRITE TO: Writing Division School of the Arts 404 Dodge Hall Columbia University New York, New York 10027 (212)280-4391 free?or, one supposes, any other?verse is heir to. The late sixties, nota bly in the ghost writing of followers of W.S. Merwin, was big on sparing us the details. In Gallagher's off moments we are not spared enough. Too few poems ki her collection avoid the expressive impulse to extend the image or the emotion. Away from this lam wife and another breathing. My forehead as field or cliff the rain a tin rushing outside the window, so close, your closed eyes, the bed descending in a shaft ofwideness meant for me. Yet not be be sure who it was you called, breaking from words you came alone to, but that: it was not me. This is the second stanza of a fourth part in a sequence of eleven. They are all "Songs of a Runaway Bride." "A tin rushing" is nice, but the rest of the writing falls into a slack imitation of the rush itself. Even out of context the stanza should focus more meaningfully and specifically on what is happening. Instead we are given the manufacture of a dream without its primary location in an actual or real world. After the image outside the window the perception moves into and onto its own gratuitous energy, with the result that closed eyes, the bed descending in a shaft of wideness, and breaking from words meet at no point of unity. The clumsy syntax solved in the last line only emphasizes that we are reading a kind of creative writing, not the poetry Gallagher is capable of. At another, more direct moment, in a poem addressed to her mother, the poet declares: "Life/caught you up in its clumsy arms/and danced you out of your Okla homa/youth into the milltown/of my birth." This country-music triteness is, again, hardly the norm in Gallagher's work. But it is a habit of mind, similar to the passion to resolve complicated emotional states as simple accretive metaphor. St. John and Gallagher are good young poets, among the best. As a pair they are certainly less compulsive than poets as vigorous and glib as Marilyn Hacker and Dave* Smith. Yet as examples they too suggest an attitude apparently widely accepted: that conviction, whether one is com mitted to the word or the world, is enough. Technique, to quote old Pound again, is the test of a man's (and woman's) sincerity: By our lights, the "technique" of controlling tone is such a test. The page should be a sanc *tity, and what is worked out there should bear the mark of the life thought through, deeply felt, even if for only that moment, turned and returned to. A form as dependent as free verse is on the sense and sensibility of particular experience demands the patience to wait out the dimensions and shape of what is to be confronted. iv The guidebook says that for many critics story is the sequence in which events occur as parts of a happening and plot is the sequence in which the author arranges, narrates, or dramatizes them. Poets are plotters. What they plot may look like pieces, notably in poetry without the cohesive dis tinctions of formal pattern. Indeed, one of the principles of twentieth cen tury free verse has been its reliance on an implied order, a "submerged structure," the arrangement of the archipelago. Fragmentation of matter presupposes fragmentation of method. Etc., etc. The whole panoply of modern art, from Cubism to Theater of the Absurd* is based on an aes thetic designed to attack apparent plot, as, more specifically, the Deep Imagism of the sixties was intended as an alternative to the rhetoric of cause-and-effect. Free verse, however, has normally provided explicit "narrators" who have tended to plot in sequences that would enhance the unity of voice without compromising the idea of "organic" ord^r. And be cause the mind of the free verse poem is revealed in the process of plot, confirmed in the act of making its way, the voice is theoretically more ex posed: the narrator is revealed by his story, hi? tone of voice by the ar rangement of that story. The reliability of the narrator is directly depen dent on our sense of th? inevitability of his plot. Poetry in the seventies is asking for a more sophisticated reading of the means by which reliability is achieved. If, for the sake of argument, we can begin to think of free verse as a form of fiction rather than a conse quence of "poetry," then we might be able to shift the emphasis from the rhythm of the interval to the rhythm of the sequel, from the mere pres ence of a speaker to the prescience of a teller, from the piecemeal evidence of the image to a full disclosure of the emotion. We might even be able to go so far as to define tone as the point of view in a poem?making our nar rator, to borrow from James, the central consciousness. The advantage of this shift in perception would be to make free verse freer?which is sim ply to describe what is happening. It is obvious, for example, that the prose-poem has taken on renewed life in the last ten years, that poets as different as James Wright and W.S. Merwin have moved, in the course of their careers, from formal to free to prose verse, that even poets still re specting the line-breaks are inviting more and more of the "dailyness of the imagination" into their work. The logic here, though, need not lead us into temptation. Freer should refer to a verse at once more responsive and responsible to the debate of experience, a debate implying not only the discrete and discontinuous but the contradictory, a debate in demand of Page 26 The American Poetry Review</page><page sequence="7">an attitude complete in its understanding of?for want of a word*-what Keats called negative capability, a phrase that has long since passed into the language. "I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capa ble of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason/ ' If fixed form would tend to resolve too much of the reliability of narrative witness, ease too readily the ironical tension of discourse in a state of doubt, the fictionalizing of free verse would open it to the fuller realization of its resources. Much of the most interesting poetry of the seventies, from The Book of Nightmares to Self Portrait in a Convex Mirror, has needed a larger forum than the simple lyric in order to include a larger complement of "uncertainties, mysteries, doubts" and required at the same time an intelligence capable of keeping the debate going. " Any irritable reaching after fact and reason," perhaps after fixity itself, would sacrifice the energy and depth of that debate. It is as if the lyric had come to a fuller understanding of its dramatic, narra tive potential?a free verse forum providing world enough and time to both show and tell, to plot the memory or the dream, to work out rather than work over the emotion, to let the language of the experience speak to the total condition of that experience. As Eliot discovered in "Prufrock" and later, more profoundly, in The Waste Land, plot should be a psychological rather than a strictly empiri cal revelation. It should reveal the "character" of the narrator just as it confers pattern to his performance; it should enlarge the psychic space as it suggests movement through time. (The narrator's prescience, not his presumed omniscience, is what we will believe.) One need not expect a forum as large as The Waste Land nor as long as Robert Lowell's ongoing autobiography?the parallel of the contemporary short story to the con temporary lyric is as dependable as the parallel of Ulysses to Eliot's great poem. The sense of size is of course relative to requirements of con tent. And the sense of size generated by plot, whether the illusion is of concentration or continuum, is the result of a competition of forces?visu al, emotional, structural, and rhetorical. While all such forces operate simultaneously, they m*ust operate together, building not only a fiction but an attitude, the substance of a point of view. In the "post-Eliot" phase, and especially in the generation of the seventies, the intersection of the flexibility of the free verse rhythm with the strategy of storytelling has produced a kind of prose lyric: a form corrupt^ eno\jgh to speak flat out in sentences yet pure enough to sustain the intensity, if not the integ rity, of the line; a form wide enough to include a range of reference yet narrow enough to select; a form coherent with and accountable to its sources yet sensitive enough to register variation in the terrain; a form expressive enough to elaborate the most inward experience yet aware enough to attract our public attention. Yet the phrase prose lyric describes the function more than the feel of the form. It deseribes, for instance, the latest stage in the long-standing career of poet Robert Penn Warren as much as it covers the beginning of the career of a poet such as Dave Smith. It does not, however, describe a shift in aesthetic stance. If nothing else, poetry today is redefining its relationship with its raw materials. The exchange is more intimate than ever, more ironical than ever, more specific than ever, more direct than ever, more relative (i.e. relativist) than ever, so that even a monument like Lowell has, since nineteen seventy, domesticized both his line and historical consciousness considerably. The commonplace, the small mo ment, has assumed the value of what was once Modernly reserved as "symbolic." Things now seem to stand mostly for themselves. The reso nance of the object and the emotion has become local rather than instant ly universal?detailed rather than detachable. The fictionalization of free verse, with its emphasis on the process as opposed to the production, with its increased emphasis on including not only the complication of the emotional evidence but to whatever extent possible the evolution of that evidence?as per, for example, recent poems as ostensibly different as Mark Strand's "The Untelling" and Louis Simpson's "Searching for the Ox"?has introduced a new fluency to the first level at which experience takes on metaphor and meaning. The order of the action can be only half of it; where the raw material comes from and how it is treated make the difference. As the narrator plots his poem, his effectiveness will depend on how well he represents his mixed emotions, the ambiguities of what passes for the ordinary. Poetry, free or half-free, as it opens itself even more to the terms of the personal and the particular, finds more room to maneuver in the strategies of fiction and within the irregularities of prose. Source arid substance. They are not so much providential as accidental And the accident-has most to do with the person or persona of the poet himself, what he or she brings to the material and what "point of view" is sustained. More than any other measure, tone is the essential means, and end, of the free verse poem. It is its one and abiding convention, the sum of its peculiar, singular parts. So it is less an attitude provided than an attitude achieved, the voice of the emotion earned. It goes without saying that we will believe what we are being told insofar as what we are being told is true, as we willingly suspend, as in a dream, our disbelief. The poet cannot afford the appearance of letting, say, the Language stand between him and his vital sources. His proof lies in the very tone of his voice, in the prosody of actual speech, when at some point in the poem that speech takes over and the voice itself becomes the hero of the story.

The path from here to that village is not translated A hero, dying, gives off stillness to the air. A man and woman walk from the movies to the house in the silence of separate fidelities. There are limits to imagination. This poem by Robert Hass is from a book-in-progress. As in so much of his best writing it places the problem of the work of art immediately be side the work of life?an imagined event in direct correspondence with a real one. And as typical, whatever ambiguity, ambivalence, or doubt there is lies in the basic situation, clearly, promptly stated. Hass rarely extrapolates from his source; rather he explores what is most palpably provided. Nearly all of his poetry is about limits, the sometimes excruci ating but irresistible finitude of things. That is why he can so often afford the sometimes rhetorical and relentless pursuit of the objective and such first lines as "In the life we live together every paradise is lost": his hold on his material feels absolute, even as his spokesman questions such au thority. No exception, "Heroic Simile" ends with an apparent admission ?there are limits to the imagination?though within the ironic context of the poem and under a suprastructure of elaborate connections the last line looks more out from than back in to what it is supporting. The dra matic situation is clear, once the position of the speaker, the narrator, is established: "I have imagined no pack animal/or primitive wagon." The reality of art, for whatever it is worth, depends here on the ability of like. Through the first two stanzas the events move as if observed but without certain disclosure of the point of view. The swordsman in the "heroic" film falls like the hero in heroic Homer, one in terms of Cinemascope, the other, Ajax, in the prosody of chanted dactyls. The rhythm of the images of the movie is to be compared to the rhythm of the sounds of the poetry: contexts of technique. But before the swordsman falls like Ajax, he falls "straight as a pine," and that little sidestep develops into the whole story-within-a-story of the rest of the poem. The method is indirection and it helps to understate and lighten the heroic or hyperbolic potential of the comparison. More than that, the method is discontinuous within the continuum bf the line "in chanted dactyls and the tree was so huge," as if the balance of dactyls and the tree were parallel. (The third line of fers a similar "parallel.") They may not be parallel, ?but they are, ironical ly, equal. In this forest, the pine goes down in falling meter. And on the third day, the peasant woodsman, sawing up the simile of the swords man, brings in his uncle to help stack the "logs in the resinous air." As the first half of the poem concludes, the tree has been further trans formed and reduced "into ten bundles and four great piles of fragrant wood,/moons and quarter moons and half moons." The hero, as in a folk tale, was too awkwardly large. The second half of the poem opens with the speaker-narrator announc ing his present-tense presence and develops with the revelation of his role as the actual protagonist. The logic of such a strategy is simple enough: to admit the T too early would have blunted the story-interest of the plot and, more importantly, compromised his authority over his "materi al." An identified, individuated voice at the outset would have surely placed the emphasis on self-consciousness rather than on the simile, on who is making the comparisons rather than on the central fact of the con nections themselves. In a word, the point of view would have been over stated through an early exposure that in turn would have emphasized the emotion of the poem over its perception?before that emotion had been earned. To begin with the T, front and center, would mean sentimentaliz ing the story, as the narrator would have no chance to prove?only to approve?his position. The moment the voice is identified, however, the narrator becomes an actor in his own fiction. The relative balance and symmetrical look of the first two stanzas?prepared as they are in a sequence of parallels and repetition?becomes attenuated by the ac knowledgment, in stanza three, of an imagination all too aware of its functional limitations. We move from the overvoice of the folktale ("The logs from midtree they halved") to the local voice of the artist-hero: at which point the verse turns a little freer, a little more relaxed, more de clarative, and certainly more anxious. It is no accident that as we clarify point of view we complicate the action, and that as we complicate the action the narrator is revealed to be the protagonist. Plot is $ process of disclosure, of the piecemeal yielding of information. Once the simile structure is set its source must be identified. Not ^ven the Great Lord can make metaphor. The narrator-protagonist, though, has created an imaginative problem for which he has been unable to anticipate an an swer. The woodsman and his uncle have stopped working because they are tired (story reason) and because "I have imagined no pack animal/or primitive wagon" (storytelling reason). So there they are "standing in midforest," suspended in present tense between what can be imagined and what is real. They are too canny, he assures us, as if to further his fic tion, to call in neighbors and go home with only a few logs after three days' labor. "They are waiting for me to do something" or to be arrested. Because, because is the spoken and unspoken refrain in the speaker's voice. Within the aesthetic space of the poem like is the connection; but within the fictions, both internal and external, cause-and-effect defines relations. How patient they are!?the old man smoking and spitting, the young man, naturally, speculating, worrying. The narrator is lender some pressure himself?"I don't know/whether they're Japanese or Mycene an." Making similies can be seductive, to the point of empathy. As a pro tagonist, he admits he is no better off than his characters. "There's noth ing I can do./The path from here to the village/is not translated." Had Hass ended the poem with his unvisited village, truncated though the sense of follow-through might be, he would have achieved a certain ironic capability?yet in a tone of voice that would have undercut the im plied seriousness of his protestations. Instead, thankfully, he commits himself to the rhetoric of an ultimate concern. Why is the narrator unable to translate any further?indeed, any farther?Tokagawa or Mycenean? Because he is not omnipotent: he is subject to the same laws of life as Kurosawa's protagonist, Homer's protagonist, and his own. "A hero, dy ing,/gives off stillness to the air," like the felling of a great tree. Hass is no more heroic than his woodsman, but within limits they each have work to do. Cutting up wood, we suppose, can be as imaginative as making a poem if the wood is halved and quartered and bundled and piled into phases of the moon. Looking, listening back, we can see that the whole poem has been pronounced within a clarifying stillness. The moment of reminder of the hero's dying is the peak of Hass's story. Its penultimate couplet?movies/fi,delities?however, is the statement that unifies and transcends the limitations of the narration. Chekhov has said that every story has a single center of gravity, a he and a she. Hass started his story at the movies, he ends it on the way back home. The stillness of the initi ating action is to be compared, to be like the silence of the conclusive mo ment, except that in fact the one has caused the effect of the other. The plot and whatever profundity of the poem stand on the ceremony of con templation, the couple in "the silence of separate fidelities." The phrase itself is a metaphor of denial, an affirmation of the inevitable and self contained integrity of things, be they objects or subjects. We can com pare, even make beautiful what seems an unlikely or unserious connec tion, say between a samurai and a pine?a suicide simile when one con siders that a sword too can be reduced to a saw. But the comparison de pends as much on differences as similarities?and in the relative world of the real perhaps mostly on the differences. Walking home from the mo vies is the one "real" act in this poem. It is part of a limited, cause-and effect world of separate fidelities. In declaring himself in the third person ("a man and woman") the narrator has kept his aesthetic distance, and difference, without sacrificing his emotional investment. These next-to last two lines may speak straight out, as to expose, yet they are also dramatic; in their disclosure they are as much a part of the total fiction as the woodsman. "Silence of separate fidelities" is, after all, the metaphor of the poem, an entity in which things may indeed be like other things. Yet images exist only in space unless they correspond to one another in that paradigm of sequence we call fiction. If the Hass narrator has failed as a "poet" he has succeeded movingly as a storyteller. At the last, he has said to us directly r in so much prose, that there are limits to the im agination because there are limits to what we can say. V A significant part of Stephen Dedalus' intellectual heroism in his three tiered theory of literary art, proposing an evolution from the lyrical (the simplest, most personal) to the narrative (longer, less personal) to the dra matic (as objective as possible). Ta the extent his hero is successful, Joyce did in truth stage his storytelling, to the point that his great work, Ulysses, Mr. Bloom's Day, is on the page a great movie?a cinematic as well as a dramatic masterpiece. Yet as drama it is an art corrupted, as it must be, by its overall dependence on narrative context and "scenes" of lyric intensity. Poetry, as we have been saying, is dramatic insofar as it presents and lyric insofar as it represents. And insofar as it coheres it tells a story. Joyce paring his fingernails aside, no form is strictly this or that; the page cannot afford such purity. The very fiction, not to men tion freedom, of free verse consists in the corruption of the form, and its most distinguishing characteristic, rhythm, whether moving across or down the page, is the result of how well or ill that corruption?that lyric, dramatic, and narrative voice?takes. The necessary combination of modes, the necessary corruption, is suggested in the single poem, but stated, completed in the book of poems. So many books of poetry appear each s?ason, most barely adequate, some exemplary, and a few truly exceptional. The genuinely good book, the one that returns and returns its value, offers more than a miscellany of fine poems. It provides us, we usually say in such circumstances, with a whole conception, a design, a vision, an organic unity, etc. And it does. But vision, for instance, is the post-perceptual phase; like unity and de sign and conception, it is the overview, the afterword. The actual oneness of the thing, though, is a mystery, an experience, and trying to break it down is like trying to separate a lyric moment from a dramatic one. What pulls us into the good book, the whole book, what keeps our attention, from poem to poem, part to part, is the accumulating strength and com plexity and interest and full character of the speaking voice, a voice that must not only articulate but act out the vision of the work. Regardless of the emotional or intellectual debate, the moral authority of any art begins with our sense of being in the presence of oneness. Who speaks becomes more important than what is said, at that initiation. The speaker, like the narrator in fiction, arbitrates unity. Three books, so obvious in their dif ferences yet similar in their emotional needs, three books from among many, stand out as whole and new: Marvin Bell's Stars Which SeeK Stars Which Do Not See, William Heyen's The Swastika Poems, and C.K. Wil liams' With Ignorance Marvin Bell may have the most refined ear of his free verse contem poraries. He is that rare poet who can hear speech as it was meant to be Page 28 Hie American Poetry Review</page><page sequence="9">written. His page is invariably a formal indictment, with even the white space structured, understood, relieved. The first stanza from "The Mys tery of Emily Dickinson'' is practically in couplets. Sometimes the weather goes on for days but you were different. Y6u were divine. While the others wrote more and longer, you wrote much more and much shorter. I held your dress once: 12 buttons. In the cupola, the wasps struck glass as hard to escape as you hit your sound again and again asking Welcome. No one. Visually the stanza complements the propriety and model of its subject: the rhythm may not be hymnal, but it is hushed,ihitimate, sure of itself? of when to speak and when to listen. Bell is a Dickinson poet. ?Has "You were divine" ever been delivered more humanely? He is well established as an intelligence of wit and n? little elegance. Poet as elaborator, a Jew ish metaphysician. But the new poems, and certainly in this small exam ple, look well past the language and the elaboration of emotion to an actu al, coherent, present source, to a rhythm as easy and as difficult as con versation. For jone thing, Bell is addressing his antagonist directly, "I held your white dress once: 12 buttons." He is speaking, not composing, even as the lines move along in their more or less metrical way, typically between a tetrameter and pentameter in length, yet always at the service of the speech. Sometimes they intensify, as in the s sounding couplet of buttons/glass; sometimes they relax, with the r's in the lines ending long er/shorter. The stanza concludes, as in much of Dickinson, with the real action off-st?ge. We never hear her knocking, her accent, asking, of all things, welcome. We hear, by analogy, about it, as in an echo, one rhymed with sound Had BeH actually stayed couplet-pure, with his lines mea sured as much for syntax as for speech, this Emily Dickinson poem might have been converted into art before it had a chance to be a poem. Later on, once the speaker transfers the scene from New England back to "home," the story enlarges to include our "sleepy householder at his routine," among the larger details of neighbors and neighborhood, and affection turning toward passion. This morning, not much after dawn* in level country, not New England's, through leftovers of summer rain, I went out rag-tag to the curb... bending to trash, when a young girl in a white dress your size passed, so softly f, carrying her shoes. As the voice of the poem is forced outside, into its own territory, away from the confines of the cupola, the idiom loosens up, the actor who is also speaking must sort between event and the emotional evidence. "I should have called to her," he says, "but a neighbor/wore that look you see against happiness." His love letter to Dickinson ends with the ulti mate compliment, imitation. "I won't say anything would have happened /unless there was time, and eternity's plenty." "The Mystery of Emily Dickinson," ghost dress or not, is no mystery. It is as domestic a poem as Bell has ever written, in a book of home bodies. The wandering Jew has settled down, "half past the Midwest, go ing West," to comtemplate, among other ohtolpgical questions, the size of the self, the limits of the self. "I wanted to see the self, so I looked at the mulberry ./It had no trouble accepting its limits." Anyone who has followed the career of the speaker of these utterly declarative lines knows that Bell, from book one, has been the most self conscious of poets, main taining an aesthetic and ironical distance that has amounted to doppel ganging. Yet in Stars Which See, the person?his voice* his softer rhythms, his talk over the telephone?has replaced tha tensions of the persona. The self is no longer the dual subject, the parallel circumstance of, say, an es cape into you, no longer an idea with which to complicate the shadows of the poem. The self is now the object, much like a tree, be it a mulberry, a wild cherry, an elm we lost, or just a leaf in July, an object to study, to come to conclusions about it had no trouble accepting its limits, yet defining and redefining a small area so that any shape was possible, any movement It stayed put, but was part of all the air. I wanted to learn to be there and not there like the continually changing, slightly moving mulberry, wild cherry and particularly the willow. Like the willow, I tried to weep without tears. Like the cherry tree, I tried to be sturdy and productive. Like the mulberry, I tried po keep moving. I couldn 't cry right, couldn't stay or go. I kept losing parts of myself like a soft maple. I fell ill like an elm. That was the end of looking in nature to find a natural self. So this poem ends?as it literally does, in four more lines of exhortation? in mock denial, in plainness. No natural self, not in the metaphor of the tree anyway. Perhaps the image "^hat gives the self the notion of the self" is as unassuming as a fern pot ("I love watching the water/ooze through the crack in the feropot,/it's a small thing//that slows time/and steadies/and gives me ideas of becoming../') or as archetypical as the poem ("Unlike so many others,/! had no wings, just shoulders./I was, like the snow bunting,/of stout build but moderate size./Better make that 'ex ceedingly' moderate size."). The poet plays with and against the issue throughout the first quarter of his book, finishing the first section with a title poem that, although it mentions neither self nor subject (first-person pronoun) is the most serious, contemplative, beautiful, and self-absorbed of all. They sat by the water. The fine women had large breasts, tightly checked. At each point, at every moment, they^ seemed happy by the water. The women wore hats like umbrellas or carried umbrellas shaped like hats. The men wore no hats and the water, which wore no hats, had that well-known mirror finish which tempts sailors. Although the men and women seemed at rest they were looking toward the river and some way out into it but not beyond. The scene was one of hearts and flowers though this may be unfair. Nevertheless, it was probable that the Seine had hurt them, that they were "taken back" by its beauty to where a slight breeze broke the mirror and then its promise, but never the water. Bell's book moves from this title poem through three more stages? from having established who is speaking (point of view) to delineating who is being spoken to in general("To No One in Particular") and in par ticular ("To His Solitary Reader") to who is listening ("To Dorothy"). Exposition, complication, resolution. In each of the book's parts the speaking voice tests itself in a kind of small talk, a quietly affirming, confident rhetoric that "whether you sing or scream" begins "inside yourself." At all stages, the reader is aware of his position as the silent partner in a dialogue (different from being the captive audience of a declamation) in which a man, paradoxically, proposes himself in the third person. "Sometimes, you think you know what people/think of you, and it's not much." Still the pattern of Bell's book is patently not in set with some overt struggle; instead it represents, in rhythms as natural as Wil liams ("the old Williams"), a story of restlessness and rest ("For us, this was the place to be stopping."), revision, and memorization into the pres ent tense. The ethos of a childhood on Long Island has never been more brought to bear on an adulthood in the middlewest of Iowa. In past books Bell tended to allude to his history; here it is a vital part of the issue, the informing angel of the book's overall tone. It is only appropriate, then, that the poet should end the four sections of his collection with two po ems dedicated to his wife and sons. He began the book alone, talking about trees, in a brown study about consciousness. He continued by con ducting a conversation with the past, his muse, fiddling with this or that stratagem. Finally, "for you and I have made it this far," he arrives at the house in town, the perfect home town. A very American story, and this is the most American, our-town of Bell's Work. Stars Which See, Stars Which Do Not See is about the wisdom of arrival, indeed about wis dom itself, about growth, about coming to terms with the most personal of limits, about transcending the single self for the will and witness of the family, even as that family is as much the place you have come from as the place you have come to. That, in linear, is the direction of Bell's book. But the title poem, the one without an announced speaker, coming as it does in the first section, implies the apparent antithesis of a journey. It is still life, Seurat. It sug gests that wisdom is a word yet to be made flesh. But forget the painting for a moment. Reread the poem. The voice, understated to tensil strength, pokes through consistently to qualify and comment, though more as an overvpice than as a dramatic or narrative interlocutor. We are at that mo ment in the book when a transition from who to whom is about to be made/The third person of the self, this objective of the subjective case, seems to speak as an entity. The scene?"of hearts and flowers"?may be too beautiful, but it is also claustraphobic, closed up in thought, the sun light hypnotic on the water. The mind is in love, yet subverted to ambigu ity, as the eye submits to pointillist generalization. Hats are like um brellas, umbrellas like hats?a fair exchange. And the water, the Seine of the scene (the wit is also tautological), hatless and still as if suspend ed, has "that well-known/mirror finish which tempts sailors." The men and women look toward the river "and some way out into it but not be yond." The voice of the poem speculates that the beauty of all this Sun day afternoon is almost too much/especially when a slight breeze, or the memory of a breeze, breaks "the mirror/and then its promise, but never the water." Hearts and flowers to one side, the poem is exquisite but not perfect. Thankfully, its voice?modulating, withholding?remains the subjective influence. From the post-impressionism of the title on, the po em reads like an extended correlative, a tone poem of the self contem plating, visualizing, voicing paralysis?a moment, not unlike the moment for the men and women looking out over the water mirror, of complete narcissism. What makes Bell's book, b?yond the poem, possible and fi nally powerful is that he steps into the mirror, that water that tempts sailors, and comes out into the future. Nevertheless, as he comments in the book's last poem, "now it seems to me the heart/must enlarge to hold the losses/we have ahead of us." "Memory is what we are," says Bell. William Heyen, in his Swastika Poems, is less interested in the aesthetic, Proustian problem, the person January/February 1978 Page 29</page><page sequence="10">ality of memory, than in the larger, shared fact and texture of memory, that matrix in which the personal and public remembering intersect. Heyen's expository epigraph is from Susan Sontag'z Against Interpreta tion: "the supreme tragic event of modern times is the murder of the six. million European Jews," she writes, and concludes that "ultimately the only response is to continue to hold the event in mind, to remember it... This moral function of remembering is something that cuts across the dif ferent worlds of knowledge, action and art." Any response to the burden of such an event, whether in action or art, any public response, implies a presumption of knowledge and guilt and experience, not to say extrapola tion, beyond our common lives. For a young American poet, first genera tion German and/or Jew, who was only five years old the day Roosevelt died, the presumption could come on as disgusting. So it is certainly no accident that Heyen spends the full first third of his book laying ground work, building credentials, establishing the materials and meanings that will sustain the moral imperative and the emotional charge and discharge of his tone of voice. He is obviously a man with bad dreams. "Men in History," part one, begins with a snapshot of the poet's Ger man immigrant father, hick tie and thick kraut hair, 1928, on the boat to America?and "rivers, trees, land, money. " We learn quickly, in succes sive poems, that the father has left behind more than the Fatherland; he has turned his back on two Nazi brothers, Wilhelm and Hermann, foot soldier and airforce, whom Heyen addresses in elegies of expiation. (Heyen is named after Wilhelm.) Though named for Wilhelm, your poet-brother, I often curse the two of you and spend my houts writing verses that wonder how your fiery, German romanticism started, and where, at last, if it did, it died That German romanticism, and expressionism, is at the source of Heyen's emotion. Along with and parallel to the family pieces, Heyen's own men in history, the poet places a letter to one Hansjorg Greiner, another dead Nazi (Oct 20, ?944 at War Camp Arsk, the Urals), Stalingrader, and alle gorical stand-in for the German army. The Greiner figure, though, is here less to juxtapose the brothers than to generalize the Heyens direct con nection to their relatives and one-time countrymen in Germany ("we say y oui name//to ourselves in the slow syllables of prayer").

I remember lines scratched on our doors, the crooked swastikas my father cursed and painted over. He came to our city, and the people were shouting and crying. They hailed the Fuehrer as the deliverer. I was in the crowd, caught in delirium, a moving box, pushed forward. Placed against the fantasy, immediately, is the imagination of pain, the Jewish problem. They walk into the house. Concrete floor and no furniture. Maybe two hundred nozzles stick out The two windows and the door lined with rubber. It's a shower, all right, but gas comes out, and twists their bodies into awful shapes. Gas does not put them quietly to sleep. Their flesh is torn with their own or others ' teeth... Their bodies were bluish red. The section ends in nightmare, a "Darkness" in which the poet admits "this love I have,/this lust to press/these words," and admits himself into the processes of defilement and death, and admits the reader too into his litany of the very kind of atrocity his rhetoric has railed against. The Fuehrer becomes father-figure. He tells me lower, and the black breastbone aches with it, the last black liquid cupped in the eyesockets smells ofiU odor of cyanide's bitter almond the viscera smeared to the backbone shines with it... Part I, "Men in History," is the real risk in Heyen's book, speaking as he does, in nouns of direct address, to the leader and those led. To create a way out of his story he has had to prepare a way in?because the story had to be told. It is a question of authenticating the action within his poems as it is the voice without. The family poems, the first five or six, are solidified, fixed surely on the page. They communicate that palpable sense of source and direction that only autobiography can provide. The moment Heyen moves into the fiction of his fiction, the Jewish question, a quality of masochism takes over, the demands of self-inflicted injury, demands that we must share. What was lyrical and dramatic in the rhythms of a growing empathy, a German family as"victim too, becomes, in the nightmare poems, a ritual of the grotesque. The moral imperative, in brutal imaginative steps, becomes the moral absolute. If we had only the initial section to judge from, Heyen's critics might be justified. But Heyen's story is a whole one, a working out and to and through. No soon er has the smell of almond and dead smoke left th? air than we are placed in prose, some twenty-five or so years later, in Belsen. The shift to prose, in clear relief to the Aryan free verse that precedes it, is brilliant, bril liant as an emotional strategy, brilliant in the total rhythm of the book, because it stabilizes a sensibility pushed to an extreme. This mid-section is entitled "Erika," after the bell-heather, "the heide, a health plant, wild and strong." Heyen elevates the metaphor by showing us where, in the dead camp, camp of the dead, the heather is, "stiff blooming" over the Bergen-Bels?n graves, now in December a "green, dark green" but in early fall, "a reddish blue," a bruise, a blush. He has come to this place as an adult in order to make his life coherent with his childhood ("All those years/there was one word I never heard,/one name never men tioned.") Such returns amount to the moral functioning of remembering. Walking Belsen's grounds as a tourist, Heyen reruns all those hideous war camp movies through his head?"the mummified bodies, the Lugers held against the temples of old men, the huge eyes, the common graves from which arms and legs sprout like mushrooms." Near the end of his commentary, and tour, he is able to acknowledge, first-hand, first-person, the dimension of man-made, manufactured death. He can hardly, himself a man now and a German child, believe it. The Erika, he says, is the blos som of memory, a real flowering in real time, "blowing green or blooming violet-red over the dead." Completing his passage, he hears out the care taker of the place reciting some of the things he still finds, turns up at Belsen: "a pin* or the twisted, frames of someone's glasses, or a key, or a wedding band." If anything authenticates Heyen's imperative tone and purpose, this prose, this standing outside the emotion long enough to see in perspective, does. The third and final section, "The Numinous," opens the line and the feel of the Une to an earned understanding of irony, resisting a seduction perhaps set up by the Erika, a flower of eloquence, to now exaggerate the emotion. "Reader,, all words are a dream./ You have wandered into mine./ Now as workers rummage among t\ie corpses,/we will leave for our af fairs." The brutalities have hardly lessened in magnitude, but the atti tude assumed has replaced the earlier potential for didacticism with the Page 30 The American Poetry Review</page><page sequence="11">power of persuasion, the power of the poet to transform his swastikas into "frost stars...their strict/crooked arms pointing/this.way and that, scare-/crows, skeletons, limbs,/akimbo." Because they are at last beyond the burden of exposition and preparation, these final poems are better able to project the solutions of imagination?"Noon, I walk among the thousands dead, hear//crows cry razor, rawr through the dark air./I watch them drift to nowhere down the wind.. ."?and to listen to experience be* fore talking back. It is as if Heyen had to pass through a certain self contempt, a stridency in the voice, in order to integrate a personality, a wholly American presence. For example, there is nothing like the beauty and music of "Simple Truths" at the beginning of the book. It is the penultimate poem (discounting a German song, "Ewigen Melodien"); it embodies the journey made as much as the vision achieved of what Heyen set out to do. When a man has grown a body, a body to carry with him through nature for as long as he can, when his body is taken from him by other men and women who happend to be, this time, in uniform, then it is clear he has experienced an act of barbarism... Numinous, the metaphor for the whole section, implies the holy, the ma gical, even the totemic, the dream-word. Swastika may be Heyen's numen, his word. His numinous word-made-flesh, however, is the body, the electric Aryan body. "Simple Truths" forces the reader to go back to the intensity, the insistence of some of the early poems for a second look. They may be nearly blasphemous, but they are enroute, in process, toward a vision of the carnal, the corrupted body incarnate. By reenact ing, as both participant and narrator, the gothic yet banal science fiction of the death camps, by dramatizing while declaring the simple truths of the body broken down to bread and then to flour, of breath reduced to spirit, by extending through some eighty odd lines the single, free verse sentence, the remembered fiction of when and from and if? and when we remember, when we touch the skin of our own bodies, when we open our eyes into dream or within the morning shine of sunlight and remember what was taken from these men, from these women, from these children gassed and starved and beaten and thrown against walls and made to walk the valley of knives and icepicks and otherwise exterminated in ways appearing to us almost beyond even the maniacal human imagination... and when we read a book of these things, when we hear the names of the camps, when we see the films of the bulldozed dead or the film of one boy struck on the head with a club in the hands of a German doctor who, will wait some days for the boy's skull to knit, and will enter the time in his ledger, and then take up the club to strike the boy again and wait some weeks for the boy's skull to knit, and enter the time in his ledger again, and strike the boy again, and so on, until the boy, who, at the end of the film of his life can hardly stagger forward toward the doctor, does die, and the doctor enters exactly the time of the boy's death in his ledger. ?by all of this, "the swastika shapes ?f trees struck by lightning," the "automatic electric Aryan swerve," the repetition and return, language and the "bloodstream and the brain-current" the language stands for, by all of this and the perspective of thirty years after swastikas on the win dows in America, Heyen remembers and makes his memory ours. The named obsession is one thing, the unnameable another. The four teen poems of C.K. Williams' With Ignorance, alternating between a sort of street talk storytelling and incandescent lyricism, seem to end where they begin, at the peripheries of speech and naming, with ignorance. The difference, of course, is that his book moves from a negative to a positive pole, from "a mouth full of nails" to "a silence rising through light." It is inevitable that a poet preoccupied with the inarticulate and inarticulated should fill the page with lines as long as prose, in pursuit of a right hand margin. "It must have been like always carrying something there that weighed too much." Indeed. Richard Howard once referred to prose as the medium out to eliminate itself, to use itself up in the irrecoverable rhythms of speech. He called it "the dialect of negation." Williams' lines eventually enjamb or turn back to recover breath, good sense, or hope. And yet they read as if determined to turn into silence, or light. The po ems themselves in this third volume, posing story against song against story in a cause-and-effect pattern, accumulate much as the individual lines do, toward something more than to something. Rhythmically, it is a book about momentum as much as meaning. Even so Williams is fond of interrupting himself with gestures like "This is going to get a little nutty now" or "There's another legend" or "I was dreaming about the uni verse." Occasionally he interrupts himself at the start of the poem? "This is a ?tory." Still, the rhythm of the book as a whole is no horizon line. The moments of the emphatic lyric, such as "Spit" or "The Race of the Flood" or "Near the Haunted Castle," offer the stories a place to get to and leave, as if the emotional life being freighted in the narrative mo ments had too much left over and some accounting had to be made. "The first language was loss, the second sorrow," Williams says on his last page. Almost every line, every image up to and including that page rehearses that knowledge, a knowledge exercised again and again against ignorance. But ignorance here suggests something deeper than unknow ing; it speaks from a position of primacy, from "the gut cave, the speech cave," from "the hide, the caul, the first mind." That is why the voice throughout the book is so consistent, so complete. It comes from an abso lute source, an emotion so exposed as to call into question the very idea of artiface. No wonder, then, the technique of Williams' total fiction is to hesitate or spill over, interrupt or repeat, pledge doubt or reassurance. With Ignorance is predicated on one of the most dangerous cliches in literature, that to recreate the condition one must imitate its origin. The artist, not the man, rescues that cliche. The artist in Williams recreates the condition of ignorance, "not to know how silently we knell in the mouth of death," in its full voice, the voice of letting go, letting out, let ting alone, the pure voice of the prose lyricist there 's a park near here where everyone who's out of work in our neighborhood comes to line up in the morning. The converted schoolbus shuttling hands to the cannery fields in Jersey were just rattling away when I got there and the small-time contractors, hiring our cheap walls, cheap ditches, cheap everything, were loading laborers onto the sacks of plaster and concrete in the backs of their pickups. A few houswives drove by looking for someone to babysit or clean cellars for them, then the gates of the local bar unlaced and whoever was left drifted in out of the wall of heat already rolling in with the first fists of smoke from the city's incinerators. Here is a poetry that proves that meter and metaphor are not necessarily symbiotic, that the music must be in the source before it can be in the sound of the line.

It is not simply that Williams* lines are long, but that they contain so much, carry so much, say and say. With Ignorance is about a man in trouble, but thank God it is real trouble. 41 Are we commended to each other to alleviate our terror of soli tude and annihilation and that's all?" This is the conclusion of the poem, "The Shade," already quoted from. I say it again: my wife, my child... my home, my work, my sorrow. If this were the last morning of the world, if time had finally moved inside us and erupted and we were Agamemnon again, Helen again, back on that faint, beginning planet where even the daily survivals were giants, filled with light, I think Vd still be here, afraid or not enough afraid, silently howling the names of death over the grass and asphalt The morning goes on, the sun burning, the earth burning, and between them, part of me lifts and starts back, past the wash of dead music from the bar, the drinker reeling on the curb, the cars coughing alive, and part, buried in itself, stays forever, blinking into the glare, freezing. Unlike Bell and Heyen, Williams is not returning to anything. Ever the urban dweller, his poems normally begin at street level and end up on the side of the mountain. Ever the actualist, he picks up the detritus lying in front of him, peopling it with friends, locals, his wife, his son and daugh ter, the drunk on his frontstep, and then he takes all this literal data and places it in a configuration, in a series of configurations, in a sequence of near-allegories in which everything is at stake and everything can be lost. What is remarkable about Williams' tone of voice, the commitment of his line, the relentlessness of his music is the extreme to which it all takes us without leaving us there. One comes away from his text feeling filled up, tested, yet emptied too, "like having yourself in a story. Sometimes real life is almost the same, as though you were being recited; you can almost tell what a thought is before it arrives." Yes, the voice recited, the thought anticipated, the configuration in outline almost from word one. The arc of the emotion is nearly the same from poem to poem not simply because of the obsessive nature of the search, but because of the singular and con tinuing appeal to archetypes?and one purpose of the length of the line and poem is to insure that transformation from street level is made. The force field of Williams' page is tremendous because the rhythms and images are so inexorably located in the first mind of their maker and are articulated from that first voice he calls silence. His poems are dream speech, he their dreamspeaker. / was dreaming about the universe. The whole universe was happening in one day, like a blossom... Perhaps the best model for the breadth of lyricism, the converting of the ordinary into the extraordinary, the presumption of innocence in the face of ugly evidence, the placing of metaphor and myth against all that is dumb and blind and deadly?perhaps Williams' best model is after all in prose, in the complicated lyricism of James Agee. Let us now praise fa mous men certainly: with a compassion that will not condescend and with a passion that will not give up. Williams is proletariat, and his romance is with a fulfillment we can imagine but cannot achieve?a romance dating back to Wordsworth. We live in an era in which elegies are love poems, love poems are elegies. We celebrate grief as if we had invented it, and perhaps we have. Poetry in our time has been more and more thrown back on its primary sources, its first cause, its first music. At one emo tional level feeling itself is the issue, not what we feel. In the work of a po et like Williams (and a prose writer like Agee) one senses he has entered the essential body of poetry, before the names have been quite made up. Old father couldn't it be a good ending if you and I could just walk away together? Or that you were the king who reveals himself who folds back the barbed, secret wings and we're all so in love now, one spirit, one flesh, one generation, that the truces don't matter? Or maybe a better ending would be that there is no ending. Maybe the Master of Endings is wandering down through his herds to find it and the cave cow who tells the truth and the death cow who . holds sea in her eyes are still there but all he hears are the same old irresistible slaughter pen bawlings. So maybe there is no end to the story and maybe there's no story. Maybe the last calf just ambles up to the trough through the clearing and nudges aside the things that swarm on the water and her mouth dips in among them and drinks. Then she lifts, and it pours, everything, gushes, and we're lost in both waters. Williams is right, there is no story. Only the weight each line is asked to carry.</page></plain_text>
