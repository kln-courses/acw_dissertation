<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW VOLUME XLII JANUARY, 1949 NUMBER 1 BARON FRIEDRICH VON H UiGEL AND HIS CONTRIBUTION TO RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY CLEMENT C. J. WEBB OXFORD UNIVERSITY 'CETTE GRANDE personnalite chretienne': the phrase, applied to him by a Swiss theologian, M. Guiran, is rightly fixed upon by M. Loisy in his Memoires as the mot juste in describing Friedrich von Hiigel. In language no less well chosen the same writer has gone on to speak of those 'valeurs intimes et profondes que M. von Hiigel a si magnifiquement et si humblement incarnees.' For it was indeed not by the construction of a system that von Hiigel promoted our understanding of religious experience, nor even chiefly by originating or giving currency to new and fruitful ideas in this department of study, but rather by the impression made by his unforgettable personality upon those who were brought into contact with it, whether through actual conversation or corre- spondence with him during his lifetime or through the reading of what he wrote and stamped with the peculiar and distinctive style in which that personality found so characteristic an expression. Therefore, while in the case of any thinker who takes as the sub- ject of his lucubrations one which, like religion, must be compre- hended, if at all, by an experience in which the whole man is engaged, some acquaintance with his biography will perhaps be found necessary to the understanding of his thought; in the case of such a thinker as he of whom I am now to speak to you it is certainly indispensable. To paint in words - as a Thomas Carlyle might have done - a picture of Friedrich von Hiigel 'in his habit as he lived' is indeed very far beyond my capacity, and I shall make no attempt to do anything of the sort; but I can mention the main facts of the story of his life, and indicate the influence which they exerted over the direction of his thoughts and over his choice of those factors in religion upon which he judged it to be his special mission to lay stress.</page><page sequence="2">2 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Carl von Hiigel, the father of Friedrich, was the representative of a family which had originally belonged to the Rhineland, and had himself passed into the diplomatic service of Austria, being at the time of his son's birth on May 8, 1852, Austrian minister at the court of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in Florence. Fried- rich's mother was a lady of Scottish birth, and he himself was brought up in infancy in Italian surroundings and early impressed with a sentiment of sympathy for the cause of Italian unity. At the age of eight he was transferred to Brussels by his father's appointment to represent Austria at that capital, and thence, at fifteen, after his father's retirement from the diplomatic service, to Torquay in England. This cosmopolitan upbringing was sup- plemented by what to a child of his strong religious instincts must have been exceptional opportunities of becoming acquainted with the atmosphere of religious environments other than that of the Roman Catholic Church, as a member of which he was brought up, his father having always been a Roman Catholic and his mother having after her marriage passed from Scottish Presby- terianism into her husband's communion. For his teachers in boyhood were Miss Redmayne, a Protestant lady, who was a friend of his mother's and a member of the Church of England; a German Lutheran tutor; and the then Prussian Minister at Brussels, Alfred von Reumont, a Roman Catholic; while he was initiated into the science of geology, in which he never ceased to be interested, by a man of eminence in his day, William Pengelly, an English Quaker. He went to no school, nor did he study at any University; and, after his father's death in 1872, he was attacked by typhus fever and, although he survived this illness, never recovered his hearing or to the end of his life enjoyed good health. It is possible to trace alike in his habits of thought and in his literary style the effects both of his deafness and of his lack of the experience of an education in common with youths of his own age in an institution with a fixed curriculum. While staying in Vienna after his illness von Hiigel went through a period of crisis, in which it would seem that he was in danger not only of losing his religious faith but of grave moral lapse - a danger his deliverance from which he always attrib- uted to the spiritual help received from two priests, from the</page><page sequence="3">BARON FRIEDRICH VON HUGEL 3 Dutch Dominican Father Raymond Hocking at Vienna and later on from the Abbe Huvelin at Paris, a remarkable man with a singular gift of insight into character, to whose saintliness and wisdom M. Loisy, no indulgent judge of pretensions to such qual- ities, has borne in his Memoires emphatic testimony. He ac- knowledged also a lasting indebtedness for guidance at this stage of his career to certain French Jesuit Fathers and to the cele- brated William George Ward, the friend of Tennyson, who, hav- ing been perhaps the most philosophically cultivated among the leaders of the Oxford movement in the Anglican Church, had be- come a Roman Catholic and so zealous a supporter of the papal claims that the moderation of the assertion of them in the Vatican Council's definition of infallibility was a disappointment to him; yet a recognition of these obligations did not win von Hiigel to sympathy either with Ward's ultramontanism or with the eccle- siastical policy of the great Society to which his French friends belonged. This time of struggle ended with his marriage in 1873 to an English lady, a convert to Roman Catholicism. For twenty years after this event he lived a quiet and scholarly life, with his home in England but usually wintering abroad in the south of Europe, and known only to a small circle of private friends. A common interest in biblical studies brought him during the last decade of the nineteenth century into contact with those who within his own communion were engaged in promoting those studies and who were discontented with the indifference or hostility mani- fested by the ecclesiastical authorities toward the new light which had been shed by the progress of historical criticism and scientific enquiry upon the interpretation of the sacred Scriptures. His high social position and the easy relations which his cosmopolitan training and connections enabled him to cultivate with scholars and theologians of various nations and confessions combined with his singularly impressive and sympathetic personality to place him at the centre of the group to which the name of 'modernist' came to be attached, and of which the late Paul Sabatier, the well known biographer of St. Francis of Assisi, described him as 'the lay bishop,' and a less sympathetic observer, Salomon Reinach, as 'the pope.' It was in the middle of the decade already men-</page><page sequence="4">4 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW tioned that, through his membership of several societies formed in England for the study of religion and its philosophical impli- cations, especially the 'Synthetic Society,' of which Arthur Bal- four, Bishop Talbot of Winchester, and Wilfrid Ward were the founders, and where I first met him - he and I were both among its original members. The influence of von Hiigel gradually spread to a wider circle, and, before the end of the first decade of the present century, the publication of his first book, that on The Mystical Element of Religion as studied in Saint Catherine of Genoa and her Friends, established his reputation as a learned as well as a highly original and stimulating exponent of a subject which for various reasons was attracting at that period the attention of many thoughtful persons - that of mysticism. I shall speak hereafter of the subsequent movement of his mind towards an ever increasing emphasis on the transcendence of God and away from the immanentism by which many of his modernist friends in his own Church (especially after the condemnation of modernism by Pope Pius X in the encyclical Pascendi of 1907) were being led to abandon to a greater or less degree their attach- ment to Catholic and in some cases even to Christian tradition. In the meantime I hope that the brief sketch which I have given of von Hiigel's earlier career will seem to supply an intelligible background to the remarks which I shall go on to offer on the contribution to the philosophy of religion made by the man whose character had been thus moulded, when the matured fruit of many years' study, reflection and experience in a mind and soul of rare depth and comprehension appeared in the essays and ad- dresses, the books and letters of the last period of his life, which was closed by his death in 1925. The student of the history of religious thought in Europe dur- ing the nineteenth century will note that a tendency in the direc- tion of what, to use a word which, in a disparaging sense, was frequently on the lips of Friedrich von Hiigel during his later years, may be called immanentism, is a feature generally char- acteristic of the period. The religious values which an earlier generation had regarded as in themselves belonging altogether to another world than this, and as revealed in this world only by way of a supernatural intervention from that higher sphere,</page><page sequence="5">BARON FRIEDRICH VON HUGEL 5 whether through a divinely authorized hierarchy, through an in- fallible record of divine acts and words, or through an illumina- tion of individual minds by a ray from the divine source of light - these religious values were now sought rather within the secu- lar civilization in which it had formerly been customary to see a mere transitory scene of human probation, the concern of each individual in which must end with his death, and which must pass away like smoke at the wholly uncertain - and possibly quite imminent - date of a catastrophic 'last day' of divine judgment. This new orientation was displayed alike by the Romantic move- ment of the early nineteenth century and by the revolutionary Socialism of its middle and later years, by the idealistic philos- ophy of the successors of Kant, and by the naturalistic Positivism to which that philosophy might seem to have been diametrically opposed. The rise of historical criticism and of anthropological research under the inspiration of the idea of evolution which, already made current by the thought of Goethe and Hegel, had received an immense impulse from Darwin's great discovery of a verifiable modus operandi in the instance of the origin of or- ganic species, had moreover aided the tendency of which I am speaking, by calling in question the traditional account of the origins of the sacred books and institutions of Christendom and subverting their claim to be regarded as without parallel or kin- dred among the religious systems of the world. To understand the position of von Hiigel in regard to the tendency of nineteenth century thought on the subject of religion which I have been endeavoring to describe, it is necessary to observe that the effect of that tendency upon the general religious outlook was twofold. On the one hand it engendered a loss of confidence in the possibility of proving the existence of God by such arguments as Kant so severely criticized in his Critique of Pure Reason, arguments drawn from considerations independent of any specifically religious experience, and, having thus proved his existence, inferring thence the reasonableness of religion. For a defence of religion conducted on those lines it substituted an appeal to the intrinsic evidence of the value of religion as directly experienced by the believing soul. In this way the 'immanentist' tendency of thought led to an emphasis on religion not as a means</page><page sequence="6">6 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW to happiness in a world demonstrably or probably governed by a Being who required of us worship as an acknowledgment of his supremacy, but as of itself satisfying an inborn need of human nature. On the other hand the same tendency to immanentism suggested that in the satisfaction of such an innate human need lay the whole justification of religion and the adequate explana- tion of its presence in human life, so that it could be accounted for as a product of human evolution without involving the recog- nition of any Reality transcending human nature of which in re- ligion we are conscious or aware. Now the movement called Modernism within the Roman Cath- olic Church, with which, in its earlier stages, Friedrich von Hiigel stood in such intimate relations, aimed, as its popular name sug- gests, at reconciling the theology and policy of that Church with the principles of thought and conduct which were characteristic of the period in which it arose - and that notwithstanding the explicit denunciation by Pope Pius IX in his celebrated Syllabus, issued in 1864, of the view that such a reconciliation could be re- garded by faithful Catholics as in itself a desirable object. It was animated by the conviction that there was much to be learned from the philosophers who had broken away from the tradition of the mediaeval schools and from the scholars who had applied to the records of the Christian religion - even to those included within the canon of Scripture - the same principles of criticism as had revolutionized the study of profane history and literature. It was prepared to follow a great English Roman Catholic whose innovations in apologetic method had themselves been received with none too warm a welcome by ecclesiastical authority - John Henry Newman - in applying to the interpretation of theologi- cal dogma that conception of development or evolution which had in the middle of the nineteenth century become the 'ruling idea' of all the sciences concerned with living beings, and which such writers as Herbert Spencer had even attempted to extend to the explanation of inorganic phenomena. Now in his readiness to accept and appropriate the assured results of genuine scientific investigation, whether in natural science, in history, or in philosophy, however discordant these might be with traditional beliefs; and also in his readiness to use</page><page sequence="7">BARON FRIEDRICH VON HtGEL 7 the idea of evolution or development as a clue to the understand- ing, as of other activities of the human spirit, so also of religion; in both these respects von Hiigel was and always continued to be a 'modernist.' In the particular department of enquiry which was at once that with which his own studies were especially con- cerned, and also that in regard to which the risk of conflict with ecclesiastical authority was greatest, the department namely of biblical criticism, he never failed loyally to follow whithersoever the argument seemed to him to lead, and was to the end wholly 'impenitent' (as he once said to me) in his adherence to modern critical views of the sacred books. It was at a moment when he had great reason to fear that these views might bring down on all who held them a censure from the possible consequences of which he, with his profound loyalty to this Church and his pas- sionate attachment to her sacraments, could but shrink with hor- ror, that he published in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (I91) an article on the Fourth Gospel in which he followed his friend Loisy to the extent of denying to it any independent historical value as a record of the life of Jesus. In von Hiigel's philosophy of religion this 'modernism' of his is represented by his constant emphasis on the autonomy of other forms of spiritual life over against religion and of religion over against other forms of spiritual life. In this part of his teaching he is plainly a child of the age whose 'immanentist' tendency I described earlier. For he hereby recognizes the value of art, science, morality as intrinsic, and not as primarily subservient or instrumental to the transcendent ends proposed by a revelation from another world than this; while correspondingly the value of religion itself is found in its intrinsic character as a form of experience irreducible to any other, and is not inferred from proofs, open to the religious and irreligious alike, which establish the existence of an intelligent Ruler of the universe. It is moreover not to be overlooked that von Hiigel's position is here a 'modernist' position not only in the sense indicated by the derivation of the word, of congruity with the tendencies of contemporary thought in general, but also in the specifically his- torical sense which it bears as the title of a movement within the Roman Catholic Church. For von Hiigel closely associates his</page><page sequence="8">8 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW view with the traditional recognition by Roman Catholic theology of a natural life ordained by God for man, with its own claims, its own value or goodness, and its own reward, distinct from those of the supernatural life which man is also called and enabled to live by that intervention of God, as it were from without, in human affairs, whereof his incarnation in Jesus Christ is the culmination. In the rejection by the Churches of the Reformation of the 'double standard' involved in the mediaeval recognition of a 're- ligious' life ordered in accordance with the evangelical 'counsels' of perfection and segregated from the secular life, which aimed only at obeying the 'precepts' necessary to salvation - in this rejection von Hiigel saw an attempt to deny the rightful claims of the 'natural' life to a relative independence of religion. The upholding of the distinction between the 'natural' and the 'super- natural' which was expressed in the maintenance by the Roman Church of the technically 'religious' or monastic life he regarded as a safeguard of the autonomy of our non-religious activities, an autonomy which was in his opinion endangered by the type of view commonly described as 'Puritan,' a type of view which, though it might sometimes have manifested itself even within the Roman Catholic Church, was, he thought, the legitimate outcome of that Protestant insistence on a 'single standard' of Christian conduct which had resulted in the general disappearance of mon- astic institutions from the life of Protestant churches. It must however be observed that von Hiigel gave to the word 'supernatural' in this connection a wider denotation than would probably be allowed to it by many Roman Catholics. In a re- markable address to young men delivered at Oxford - I was myself in the chair on the occasion - and subsequently published among his Essays and Addresses, while not denying the occur- rence of miracles, he not only refused to identify the 'super- natural' with the miraculous, but included among his instances of the former a number of cases of heroic conduct which were neither explicitly concerned with the Christian religion nor even in all cases exhibited by Christian believers. Such were the de- votion of a dying astronomer to his task of recording his observa- tions of the transit of Venus, and the courage of a Jewish rabbi</page><page sequence="9">BARON FRIEDRICH VON HtVGEL 9 who, in the first world war, amid a hail of bullets, held up before the eyes of a dying Catholic soldier the image of Christ upon the cross. It is not improbable, considering the mutual respect and friendship which existed between Friedrich von Hiigel and the German philosopher Rudolf Eucken, that there is something more than coincidence in the resemblance, which will strike those acquainted with the writings of both, between von Hiigel's doc- trine of the 'supernatural' in the address to which I have been referring and Eucken's description in his Wahrheit der Religion of the love of one's enemies, which is prescribed in the Gospel, as by itself affording sufficient evidence of the presence in the world of a higher life than can be adequately accounted for on purely naturalistic principles. But, whether due or not to influence ex- erted by one of these thinkers on the other, the resemblance in their views illustrates the fact that von Hiigel's criterion of the 'supernatural' was found by him in the intrinsic character of the actions to which he applied the term and not in their external association with the historic revelation which he notwithstanding held to have been in fact given to man through Christ and his Church. Thus in this matter von Hiigel is still in line with what I have called the 'immanentist' tendency which is observable in the religious thought of the nineteenth century generally, and in particular in the 'Modernist' movement which aimed at domesti- cating the issues of that thought within the Roman Catholic communion. We find them in von Hilgel's teaching respecting the autonomy of the various distinct forms of spiritual life over against religion and of religion over against them a contribution to the philosophy of religion which he may be said to have made as a 'modernist.' One who was the most prominent of his fellow modernists but who eventually ceased to be a modernist because, unlike von Hiigel, he altogether abandoned hope in the possibility of a recon- ciliation between the Roman Church as now organized and the freedom of thought requisite to genuine historical investigation - I mean, of course, M. Alfred Loisy - has criticized this teach- ing of von Hiigel's on the ground that all our spiritual activities should be infused by a religious spirit. This I take it that von Hiigel would by no means have denied; but his view of religion</page><page sequence="10">10 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW was really a very different one from Loisy's insofar as he regarded it as being (to use a saying of his which has often been quoted) essentially adoration, and thus as having a distinctive sphere of its own apart from any other in which the religious man may also exhibit the temper which he has acquired in his experience of adoration, just as the scientific man may and should carry into his religion the self-discounting, objective habit of mind which he has cultivated in his laboratory. It was moreover precisely in this connection that von Hiigel was led to propound what is per- haps the most original and fruitful idea with which he has en- riched the philosophy of religion. The slighting reference to this idea in M. Loisy's Memoires does but illustrate the incapacity of that distinguished scholar to appreciate a mind fundamentally uncongenial to his own. The idea in question is that of the part which may be played by the deterministic outlook of modern science in purifying re- ligion. Von Hiigel was keenly alive to a certain danger besetting such a religion as Christianity (with its emphasis on the love of God for individual persons and their capacity for response to that love), and especially in the form assumed by it in the Roman Catholic system, which he so highly valued and to which he was so devotedly attached, with its encouragement in the believer of a childlike intimacy and intercourse with the heavenly Father, the Saviour, and the saints. This danger was that of an un- qualified anthropomorphism, which would rob the religious man's outlook of that seriousness and humility which comes from a realization of his littleness and powerlessness in the presence of a universe governed by laws which take no account of our trivial desires and plans, and by the irresistible operation of which our whole world is at every moment liable to be overwhelmed. In former times the traditional eschatology had provided a correc- tion in this respect for the factors in Christian piety which ex- posed it to the danger in question. At any moment there might, it was held, burst upon humanity the 'day of judgment,' whose date, although preordained from eternity in the divine counsels, is for us as uncertain as its future occurrence at some date is certain. Civilization had, in the view of the elder Church, no such value of its own as could entitle it to endure one moment beyond</page><page sequence="11">BARON FRIEDRICH VON HtVGEL 11 the point up to which it might subserve a divine purpose which remained essentially 'other' than the achievement of its imme- diate end of facilitating or enriching the life of human beings under earthly conditions. The second coming of Christ might cut its existence short at any moment, just as the individual's death might at any moment put an end to his particular career. The waning of belief in this traditional eschatology owing to the difficulty of reconciling it with the outlook of modern natural science might, it is plain, easily tend to deprive religion of factors with which it could ill dispense - the sense of the transiency and comparative unimportance of this life and of the helplessness of humanity in the presence of infinite and eternal realities. But, so von Hiigel was wont to suggest, the very science which had weakened the faith of Christians in the apocalyptic pictures of 'that day of wrath, that dreadful day' which had haunted the imagination of their fathers - those very sciences were provid- ing a substitute which might, even better than those pictures, perform for religion the same service that they had formerly rendered. For the world-order and the world-process as revealed by modern science, with an extension in space immeasurably vaster than any which Christian tradition attributed to the 'heaven and earth' which God created, and a duration in time immeasureably more prolonged than any which it contemplated for that creation, far more effectually dwarf the scale of the scene on which the drama of human life is played than they could as imagined by our forefathers. So also the determinism which is assumed - or at least until the other day was assumed - as a necessary presupposition of scientific investigation involves a more utter indifference to human values than that which was implied in the old doctrine of predestination, since it excludes any miraculous intervention by a Creator and any ultimate ref- erence to the lot awarded by divine justice and mercy to human beings. Nowhere then could the Christian better learn to think of God's nature and designs as infinitely transcending any picture which, under the influence of a faith in his revelation of himself through Christ and the Church, might be made of them as rela- tive to our individual lives and purposes. Thus the Christian can use the scientific outlook to chasten and purify his religious</page><page sequence="12">12 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW imagination and to attain, it may be, to a belief in the reality of divine providence and in the eternal significance of human per- sonality which shall not be exposed to the contempt nowadays so lightheartedly bestowed by novelists and essayists on what they suppose to be the Christian doctrines of God and man as dreams impossible for men who are alive to the discoveries of modern science. Yet in so using science the Christian will not be ignoring that autonomy of each of the various spheres of our spiritual activity, religion included, on which von Hiigel was so much concerned to lay stress. For the assistance which science may offer to religion is only available just so far as the religious man has immersed himself in the scientific view of the world, without making any attempt to qualify it by alien considerations borrowed from the sphere of religion. For only so will he come to the consideration of the data of religious experience which de- mand the recognition of personality in God and of a significance in man transcending that which can be allowed to him when re- garded merely as one of the species of organism evolved upon this planet, with a mind fully familiarized with those aspects of reality which are most difficult to reconcile with those data. But no reconciliation of aspects of reality which are at first sight in mutual contradiction can even begin to promise satisfaction to an honest thinker which does not give its fullest weight to the wit- ness which each aspect affords to the ultimate character of the reality of which either is alike an aspect. If however in this brilliant and profound suggestion of von Hiigel's that modern science may discharge for the religion of today the function which the traditional eschatology attempted to perform for that of an earlier generation there is nothing un- congenial to the principles of Modernism, we may yet legitimately see in it an indication of that turn of mind in its author which eventually led him to appear less as an exponent than as a critic of the movement which he had done so much to foster. For this suggestion is obviously inspired by a profound sense of man's insignificance in the presence of God and of the indispensable- ness to religion of a whole-hearted recognition of God's tran- scendence of humanity. This sense made von Hiigel the con- vinced opponent of a line of thought, present in the nineteenth</page><page sequence="13">BARON FRIEDRICH VON HtGEL 13 century philosophy of religion, which found its most representa- tive exponent in Feuerbach, of whom in this capacity he pub- lished a penetrating criticism under the title 'Religion and Illu- sion.' However developed, whether as by absolute idealists, by sociologists of the school of Durkheim, or by so called 'new' psychologists, any denial of divine transcendence, any oblitera- tion or minimization of the distinction between the human spirit and the divine came to figure in von Hiigel's later teaching under the name of 'immanentism' as the grand enemy of true religion in theory and in practice alike. But the transcendence of God did not in von Hiigel's view stand alone. Religion was ultimately interested in maintaining everywhere the genuine reality of the object of human appre- hension; and he would certainly have himself regarded as his main contribution to the philosophy of religion his emphasis upon the importance of recognizing here as elsewhere the inde- pendence of the object upon the mental process by which it is apprehended. It was precisely at this point that von Hiigel's philosophy diverged from that associated with the 'Modernist' movement. That movement had originated in a revolt against the cramping restrictions imposed upon freedom of thought in the Roman Catholic Church by the reluctance of the ecclesiastical authori- ties to permit departures from established tradition. But in philosophy (especially after the encyclical of Leo XIII Aeterni Patris, issued in 1879) the established tradition meant the tradi- tion of mediaeval Scholasticism. Now the outstanding feature by which Scholasticism is distinguished from the later philosophy which looked to Descartes as its patriarch was precisely its main- tenance of that independence of the object of knowledge upon the knowing subject which to common sense and to classical antiquity alike had appeared to be involved in the very nature of knowledge, but which was called in question by the specula- tion the starting point of which was the Cartesian Cogito ergo sum. It was not surprising therefore that, by reaction from Scho- lasticism, a tendency should have manifested itself in modernism to move in the direction of the subjectivism which was at the time of its appearance producing philosophies of religion which dwelt</page><page sequence="14">14 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW upon its biological value rather than upon its ontological validity, and which reflected in theology the way of thinking which was contemporaneously taking shape in the so called 'Pragmatism' of William James. The encyclical Pascendi, although, in attrib- uting to Modernists a greater uniformity of philosophical opinion than was as a matter of fact to be found among them, it was doubtless unjust to individuals, was not mistaken in its diagnosis of the speculative affinities of much Modernism. Von Hiigel, however, although in sympathy with his fellow- modernists in their aspirations after emancipation from the yoke of the scholastic tradition and freedom to appropriate the gains of the great philosophical movement of the last three centuries, was yet profoundly convinced that the subjectivist trend per- ceptible in that movement was mistaken, and that a fruitful in- terpretation of religion, and indeed of spiritual life generally, must emphasize the necessity of recognizing in the object - in the physical world, in living things, in persons, in God - a gen- uine reality of its own over against the subject, the apprehending mind. 'All and every monism' (the phrase is von Hiigel's own) must lead, be held, in proportion as it is taken seriously, to the impoverishment of the experience for which it endeavors to account. His insistence (in agreement with Aristotle and St. Thomas) on the indispensableness of sensation as the starting point of all experience; his stress on the need for religion in par- ticular of historical facts and outward institutions and sacra- mental means of grace; on the incarnation of God in Christ; on the prevenience of God; on adoration as constituting the essence of religion; all these features of his teaching hang together. Al- though his great work on the 'Mystical Element in Religion' established his reputation as an authority on mysticism, he was not himself in the strict sense of the word a mystic. The born mystic is animated by passion for union with the object of reli- gious worship, and even the mystic most humbly loyal to his religious confession is with difficulty restrained from transgress- ing the bounds of orthodoxy in identification of the soul with God at the highest or deepest level of its life. But this passion was far less marked in von Hiigel than his keen sense of dependence from first to last upon Another than himself. Moreover, we do</page><page sequence="15">BARON FRIEDRICH VON HUGEL 15 not find in his analysis of religion the mystical type of devotion sufficiently distinguished from that which Professor Heiler has called the prophetic. The 'mystical element' is by von Hiigel considered as embracing all that is emotional and inward in re- ligion over against the 'institutional' and 'intellectual' elements, and one consequently misses in him an adequate study of that type of piety which can perhaps be more easily illustrated from the records of Protestant communions than from those of the Church to which he belonged - that, I mean, which is exempli- fied in England by such names as those of Bunyan, Wesley, Cowper --intensely individual, inward, emotional, but not in- spired by the properly mystic desire to lose oneself in God. In piety of this type, when his attention was called to it, Von Hiigel was apt to miss (as also in the mystics strictly so called) an ade- quate sense of its actual dependence at every point upon histori- cal happenings, traditions and institutions, the importance of which it was inclined, in the consciousness of its spiritual freedom and direct access to God, unduly to disparage. He himself on the other hand was always vividly aware of such dependence and was disposed to testify his gratitude to the channels through which God's grace had reached him in a joyful conformity, wherever his conscience permitted it, even with customs of his Church (such as the use of the rosary) which in themselves meant little to him, if such conformity might intensify his sense of unity with his fellow Churchmen in their worship of his God and theirs. This orientation of his thought and feeling inevitably parted him more and more from those who were moving in an opposite direction. It would be quite unjust to see in his later development merely the result of his desire not to be cut off, as were some of his friends, from participation in the sacraments of his Church. Greatly as he shrank from the prospect of such a deprivation, he would have faced it, even though with agony, if he had been presented with the alternative of denying his conscientious con- victions or enduring excommunication. That he escaped being presented with this alternative and was thus spared what would have been a bitter martyrdom he probably owed, to a degree of which he was perhaps not fully aware, to his high social position</page><page sequence="16">16 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW and to the respect which he enjoyed among influential persons not of his own communion. But if, as has been written of him by one of his friends, he was a saint but not a martyr - if it be even true that he did not court martyrdom - yet there is no reason for supposing that, had he been offered it, he would have declined the palm. His ever deepening conviction, to which I have already referred, that in doubting the independence of the object of knowledge upon the knowing subject, modern philos- ophy had taken a wrong path, naturally led him to set more and more value on the scholastic assertion of this principle, and so to put him out of sympathy with any undiscriminating rejection of a tradition which was bound up with the championship of what was in his eyes so important a truth. Thus, just as he showed a special sympathy with the realistic reaction against a lately dominant absolute idealism, a reaction which he noted as in progress in Great Britain during the last twenty years of his life, so he came to exalt the 'golden middle age,' as he was wont to call it, even above the Catholic Renaissance which had at- tracted him more in earlier days and to which his heroine St. Catherine of Genoa belonged. But he never, that I know of, withdrew his definite preference of pre-Tridentine Catholicism to that of the period which ensued upon the definitive parting at Trent between the Roman communion and the Churches which seceded from it at the Reformation. So again the loss by many of those who had been his allies in the first days of the Modernist movement of a hold on what he considered to be essen- tial truths of philosophy and religion made him set yet greater store, if that were possible, upon the help towards retaining a hold upon them which continued contact with the ecclesiastical tradition afforded to himself. But there was no lack of con- sistency in his later teaching with that doctrine of the autonomy of the various species of non-religious spiritual activity over against religion and of religion over against them which expressed the ground of his adhesion to the modernist movement. This he held to the end, seeing (not without justification) in the 'im- manentism' which he criticized in some of his friends, a denial of the autonomy of religion and an advance toward a subjectivism which must in the long run deny that which he took to be the</page><page sequence="17">BARON FRIEDRICH VON HVtGEL 17 very essence of religion, namely the adoration which presupposes the transcendent reality of its object. Von Hiigel's main contribution to the philosophy of religion is thus his insistence on the transcendence of God as essential to religion, and this against the background of a philosophical real- ism which everywhere acknowledges the independence of the object of knowledge upon the process by and in which it is known. There is nothing in this incompatible with the Modernism which had been his; for this was an insistence on the mutual distinct- ness and several autonomy of the different species of spiritual activity. And with this von Hiigel's doctrine of transcendence is more harmonious than is any subjectivism or idealistic monism such as he suspected to be involved in what he called the 'im- manentism' of some of his friends; and indeed the antimodernism of the Italian philosophers Croce and Gentile is certainly closely connected with their philosophical monism. On the other hand we must note the affinity of von Hiigel's doctrine of divine transcendence with that of writers such as Otto, Barth, and Brunner, who in quite recent times have re- acted against the immanentism of nineteenth century theology; while recognizing that von Hiigel is wholly exempt from what I think is an unfortunate tendency present in some of the most vigorous theological thought of today, the tendency so to sever the revelation of God in Christ from that in the general spiritual development of humanity that we seem to be pushed back into that very position against which the Modernism which found a leader in von Hiigel was essentially a reaction. In von Hiigel's judgment it was an advantage possessed by Roman Catholic theology over Protestant that it could, he thought, give a more unqualified welcome to elements derived from other sources than that of the revelation whereof the Bible is the record, and a heartier recognition to the natural life of man as having a value of its own distinct from that of the supernatural and necessary to the full realization of the value of the latter. I do not desire in this place either to endorse or to dispute this view, but it was because he held it that von Hiigel was at once a protagonist of the earlier and a critic of the later views of some who were allied with him in one of the most important movements in the recent</page><page sequence="18">18 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW history of religion, on the issues of which it is reserved for an- other generation than mine to pronounce a final judgment. I began by saying that Friedrich von Hiigel was above all a great Christian personality, yet now that I am ending, I find that I have discussed his views but done nothing to put before you the man himself. Nevertheless, while I have been speaking, I have always been seeing the lineaments of a face, hearing the tones of a voice, feeling the inspiration of a presence which, once familiar, can never be forgotten, and which, beyond those of any man that I have known, by the witness which they bore to the depth, the richness, the intellectual and moral discipline, the balance and sanity of the religious experience expressed therein, impressed upon his friends that great conviction which he had hoped in the book he left unfinished to bring home to his con- temporaries, of the 'Reality of God.'</page></plain_text>
