<plain_text><page sequence="1">God in Man's Image: Thoughts on the Genesis and Affiliations of some Romano-British Cult-imagery By MIRANDA J. GREEN INTRODUCTION Ssignificant proportion of Romano-British religious iconography betrays characteristics that do not owe their presence directly to Classical models. Both style and symbolism 1 are, here, indicative of a reference to traditions outside the Mediterranean artistic repertoire. Even so, in such regions as the Cotswolds and in areas of northern Britain, such imagery seemingly emerges fully-fledged in the Roman period, with no apparent antecedents in the indigenous material culture of the British Iron Age phases which immediately preceded the Roman conquest. Some iconography has clear and close parallels with Romano-Gaulish representational traditions, but that does not explain why - equally in Britain and Gaul- an apparently new set of divine images suddenly materialized after the introduction of Roman culture. Various hypotheses may be constructed to try and explain such seeming dislocation of tradition, although none is wholly satisfactory. Should we search for Iron Age iconographical models in the quasi-representational imagery decorating some Iron Age metalwork or in the motifs adorning Iron Age coins? Should we argue for prototypes for Romano-British and Romano-Gaulish sculptural traditions within the lost archive of wooden images, the limited survival of which, in waterlogged contexts, suggests the onetime existence of a body of evidence which has largely perished? Are some of the carved stone images appearing in Roman Britain and Gaul the result of stimuli created by pre-conquest Classical material, including Roman coins and gemstones? Or should we, perhaps, see such non-Classical, and therefore apparently indigenous Romano-British and Romano-Gaulish cult-imagery either as an essentially Roman construction, a deliberately-orchestrated post-conquest device for codifying, formalizing and to a degree - inventing a set of Gaulish and British divinities or as an equally intentional Gallo-British construct, designed to reassert native religious independence during the Roman period? Finally, we need to enquire as to the mechanisms by which the perpetrators of the British sculptural tradition derived their inspiration from Gaul. In order to explore the issues outlined above, I have chosen a region of Britain which produced a lively repertoire of non-Classically-inspired images: the Cotswolds, focusing around Cirencester and Gloucester. At the outset, I should define the term 'non-Classically- inspired'. Virtually all Romano-British and Romano-Gaulish sculpture owes something to Graeco-Roman traditions of artistic expression: even depictions which - in terms of their symbolism - appear totally foreign to the Classical pantheon can be said generically to derive from Mediterranean traditions of anthropomorphic divine representation; and even images that do not fit into the Graeco-Roman religious repertoire may reflect Roman inspiration in terms of dress or hairstyle. Influences from the Mediterranean world did not, of course,</page><page sequence="2">I8 MIRANDA J. GREEN suddenly manifest themselves during the period of imperial Roman expansion into and annexation of Western Europe. Indeed, many of the artistic traditions of Iron Age temperate Europe, from the seventh century B.C. onwards, had drawn inspiration from Greece and the Near East.' CURRENT MODELS The main theories at present in vogue which seek to explain the mechanisms by which indigenous religion was romanized in post-conquest Britain may conveniently be grouped under an overarching label here termed the 'Out of Rome' model. One current thesis within this model is that recently presented by Jane Webster.2 Taking epigraphic name-pairing (the linkage of Roman with native or Gaulish god-names) as her data-base, she argues that so- called interpretatio romana has to take into account its situation 'as a post-conquest discourse' and therefore challenges the idea of 'retrospective inference', the uncritical assumption that the Gaulish or British divinities - whose worship is attested in the Roman period by epigraphic dedications - pre-existed the conquest in any meaningful or identifiable sense. Webster's warning has considerable validity, but her model of interpretatio, as driven entirely by Roman imperialist rules and motivation, a 'subjugation' model, requires some modification since it appears both to overstate and oversimplify the issues under scrutiny. There was undoubtedly a fundamental shift in religious expression in Gaul and Britain in the post-conquest period,3 with the gods both named and represented as more or less standard anthropomorphic images, but what seems more equivocal is the extent to which such new ways of expressing divinity reflected new religious perceptions. It may be that the very different methods by which the gods and goddesses of Britain were represented - in both epigraphy and iconography- did reflect different ways of conceptualizing the indigenous spirit-forces, but this does not necessarily mean that the nature of those gods also fundamentally changed. Religion is a conservative phenomenon, and it would be surprising if the presence of Roman culture were to have caused the native population to abandon their old beliefs wholesale, particularly if- as is generally accepted those beliefs were rooted in the land and in the ancestral presence.4 To argue that conflation of Roman and indigenous deities implies Roman superimposition5 and an unequal weighting in favour of romanitas is, I think, to confuse expression with belief. The 'epigraphic habit' may not have been sufficiently powerful to alter belief-systems, although it would have had a considerable effect, in terms of codification. Likewise, the 'iconographic habit' may also mask native characteristics whilst, as Martin Henig has suggested,6 simultaneously bringing an important new dimension to the attitudes of the Britons towards their divine world. In citing 'modern' colonial models as parallels to the relationship between Rome and her provincials,' we have to be careful because not all colonial systems are the same. A glance at the area of Bahia in Brazil8 shows that colonialism can be a complex and multi-directional business, involving two- or even three-way processes of interaction. In the Reconcavo region 1 Megaw 1989, 65-6. 2 Webster 1995. 3 Henig 1995, 43. 4 Brunaux 1996, 38-9. 5 Webster I995. 6 Henig 1995. 7 Webster I995. 8 Williams 1979.</page><page sequence="3">GOD IN MAN'S IMAGE 19 of Bahia, there exists a complicated network of interwoven belief-systems in which Portuguese Catholicism, indigenous Amerindian religious tradition, and the Yoruba cults originally introduced by West African slaves as early as the sixteenth century, interact in a rich, dynamic, and essentially non-hierarchical manner. The Christianity of the Portuguese colonials has been modified and broadened to such an extent that it is difficult to draw a line between the saints of the Catholic Church and the orixcis (spirits) of the Yoruba system. Both strands, in their turn, feed upon the indigenous cult-practices associated with the use of plants in healing ritual. Such a syncretic model, to my mind, better fits the situation in Roman Britain and Roman Gaul than the 'subjugation' model, in which Roman influence in religion is viewed as involving oppression and obligation. It would be a mistake to underestimate the impact of the new Roman cultural tradition but to see Romano-British religion as a uni-directional 'top-down' phenomenon, with Rome calling all the tunes, is too simplistic a framework in which to understand a highly complex and positive new system within which, I would argue, the Graeco-Roman and indigenous traditions played full, active, and voluntary roles. Martin Henig's thesis argues convincingly for the main inspiration to native craftsmen deriving from Classical iconographical traditions: 'the art of Mediterranean lands was a constant stimulus to the Celtic craftsman in the lowland zone of mainland Britain until the Roman conquest'.9 This is important, for it sets the scene for the acceptance of new iconographic traditions in post-conquest Britain. During the first century B.C. and the earlier first century A.D. the British aristocracy would have had access to decorated red-gloss ceramics, silver tableware, gold jewellery, carved intaglios, and coins from the Roman world.'0 British chieftains, seeking for new ways to express their status relative to the rest of the population, may have sought to embrace Mediterranean artistic traditions, partly as a mark of sophistication and partly because of the value of these imports as rare, exotic objects. The new ways of offering to and propitiating the gods, as evidenced by epigraphic and iconographic dedications, involved a relationship between commissioning patrons and stonemasons; decision-making probably also involved religious officials. What is unclear, however, is how new those mechanisms in fact were. How different was the patron-priest-craftsman pattern from that which pertained in the later pre-Roman Iron Age, when patrons were evidently commissioning mobiliary art on weapons, jewellery, and coins. John Creighton has suggested" that priests specifically the Druids - may have been partly responsible for the choice of symbolic motifs on Iron Age coins and if, as has been argued elsewhere,12 Iron Age European and British art has a primarily symbolic function, then these artists, too, may have drawn inspiration from professional or quasi-professional clergy. In using Henig's 'Roman art' perspective, it is wise not to accept too readily the use of specific Graeco-Roman originals as prototypes for Romano-British religious sculpture, without taking into account the Gaulish dimension. Whilst Mediterranean models were undoubtedly sometimes used (for example, the inspiration for depictions of the Gaulish healer- goddess Sirona must surely have come directly from Classical images of Hygeia'3), study of Romano-Gaulish iconography shows quite clearly that it fed into the repertoire of Romano- British sculptors (see below). The problem of affiliations can be exemplified by the carving from Lincolnl4 which has been identified as a depiction of Venus and Adonis. This may be correct, but a clear resemblance between the Lincoln pair of deities and some representations 9 Henig 1995, 13. 10 Henig 1995, 32. 11 Creighton i995. 12 Green 1996; Megaw 1989. 13 For example, the inscribed bronze group of Apollo and Sirona from Mdlain in Burgundy: Mus6e Archbologique de Dijon; Green 1989, 62, fig. 24. 14 Blagg and Henig 1986.</page><page sequence="4">20 MIRANDA J. GREEN of divine couples from Burgundian sites15 may have more relevance to the interpretation of the Lincoln carving. Thus, we should not assume direct Classical connections for Romano-British cult-iconography without examining possible Gaulish models although, of course, those models themselves may derive ultimately from Classical imagery. HIDDEN ANCESTORS An enquiry that questions aspects of the 'Out of Rome' theory to explain the development of Romano-British cult-iconography has, of necessity, to propose alternative mechanisms to account for the burgeoning of imagery - particularly in stone - after the conquest. The 'Out of Rome' model has undoubted validity for a great deal of Romano-British imagery but it does not satisfactorily explain the appearance of image-forms that are plainly foreign to Classical tradition, whether in terms of style or symbolism. Scholars have repeatedly pointed to the paucity of human representation in Iron Age art.16 This is certainly true of monumental sculpture: there is little religious stone carving in Britain or in Europe of pre-Roman date, with the notable exceptions of the area around Marseille between the fourth and later second centuries B.C.17 and parts of Central Europe, particularly the Rhineland and Baden-Wtirttemberg in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C."8 It is generally maintained that the Lower Rhone Valley group owed its inspiration to the presence of the Greek colony founded in about 6oo00 B.C. by the Phoceans at Marseille, but it is less easy to explain the early stone imagery of Central Europe. Moreover, there is a scattering of later Iron Age stone figures from Gaul, notably the second-/first-century B.C. image of a torc-wearing 'god' with a boar depicted striding along his torso,19 and a small group of simply-carved images from Brittany.20 The general dearth of stone iconography throughout the pre-Roman Iron Age appears to mean that for most regions of Europe and Britain the medium of stone for representing the gods was seldom employed. But this does not necessarily mean that other iconographic media did not exist. In 199o, Bryony Coles published a corpus of wooden anthropomorphic figurines from Britain and Ireland.21 The study is of particular interest not least because, through its publication of a series of CI4 AMS dates for the figurines, it has established a calendrical chronology for the group ranging from around 2300 to 350 B.C. It is noteworthy that three British sites have produced wooden images dating to the earlier Iron Age: the female figure from Ballachulish in Argyll, dated to between 728 and 524 B.C.; the set of statuettes (some of whom bear shields) from Roos Carr on Humberside belonging to the late seventh to late sixth century B.C.; and the 'idol' from Kingsteignton in Devon, carved between about 426 and 352 B.C. Wooden images are recorded with far greater frequency in continental contexts: those associated with timber trackways in Lower Saxony belong to the later first millennium B.C.; and there are late Iron Age wooden figurines from Switzerland, the prime example being the 15 For example, the divine couples from Alesia: Espdrandieu 1907-66, no. 3341; Deyts 1976, no.

The first phases of both sanctuaries date to the first century B.C., and are thus at the interface of the pre-Roman and Romano-Celtic periods. In view of the well-attested pre- Roman practice of figure-carving in wood, there is no reason to explain the presence of these figures entirely in terms of the stimulus engendered by Roman traditions. It has often been emphasized that Iron Age art, with few exceptions, is essentially 'mobiliary' art decorating portable, functional objects, rather than monumental or 'gallery' art.26 Moreover, the number of portable anthropomorphic figurines dating to the pre-Roman Iron Age is comparatively small. In Britain, as we have seen, only three wooden images have been securely dated to this period.27 If we look for representations in other media, once again our sample is meagre: it includes the enigmatic chalk figurines from North Humberside;28 a bronze female figure from the Henley Wood temple-site in North Somerset, which probably dates to immediately before the Roman conquest;29 the somewhat similar image from Aust, on the banks of the Severn, which may be roughly synchronous;30 and the head from Thornwell Farm, Chepstow.31 In addition to the presence of figurines in the round, there is a considerable body of early and middle Iron Age decorated metalwork from both Britain and the Continent which - despite the overriding tradition of 'abstraction' - nevertheless embodies elements of human representation. Good illustrations of this tradition include the widely-distributed La Tene swords and daggers with anthropomorphic hilts found, for example, at North Grimston, Yorkshire and Shouldham, Norfolk32 and at Tesson (Charente-Maritime) in France.33 Moreover, throughout the main span of La Tene Iron Age art (fifth-first centuries B.C.), human heads or faces, of more or less naturalistic form, were used as motifs forming elements within sometimes complex geometric designs.34 'Hidden ancestors' for Romano-British (and Romano-Gaulish) iconography may also be sought on Iron Age coinage. It is a commonplace that the early progenitors of Iron Age 'Celtic' coins are to be found in the Classical world and that many European Iron Age coin series derive from Roman Republican and early Imperial issues.35 However, certain features of the iconography of Iron Age coins - occurring in Britain, France, and elsewhere in temperate Europe demonstrate themes that are distinctly non-Classical and, of particular relevance here, some of those themes are reflected in both late Iron Age and Romano-Gaulish/British non-numismatic imagery. One good example of such shared iconography is the motif of the 22 Bonnet 1991. 23 Planck 1991. 24 Vatin 1969; Romeuf 1986. 25 Deyts 1983. 26 Green 1996, 9. 27 Coles 1990; contra Cunliffe 1991, 521. 28 Cunliffe I991, 520--I, fig. 19.15; Stead 1988. 29 Henig 1996a, fig.

GREEN ram-headed or ram-horned serpent, a hybrid creature that belongs not to the repertoire of the Mediterranean world but to the cultic and mythic traditions of non-Classical Europe.36 Derek Allen illustrates ram-horned snakes on several Gaulish coins.37 The image of the Gaulish antlered god 'Cernunnos', well-known in sculptures of Roman date from northern Gaul (see below), is not unknown in the Iron Age numismatic repertoire, and the head of an antlered anthropomorphic being appears on a British silver coin dating to about A.D. I0-20.38 Other coin-images reflect late pre-Roman or Romano-British/Gaulish iconographic connec- tions. The reverse of a silver eastern Gaulish issue shows a naked human figure, identified as Hercules, accompanied by another, smaller figure clad in a hooded sagum.39 It is difficult not to link these images with the very similar synchronous wooden statuettes of hooded people from such sites as Geneva and Fontes Sequanae (above), and with the later hooded figures known as Genii cucullati from Romano-British and Gaulish sites (see below). Similarly, late Iron Age bronze coin issues from Rheims, the obverses of which depict triple heads,40 must surely be antecedents of the Remic stone triple heads of the Roman period.41 The late British silver issue of Cunobelin depicting a horsewoman, dressed in a long robe and riding side- saddle,42 may well anticipate images of the Gaulish horse-goddess Epona who, in the Roman period, was venerated over a large area of Europe, from Scotland to Bulgaria.43 The frequency of boar-motifs on Iron Age coins reflects their relative popularity in the representational art of later Iron Age Europe and, moreover, a feature common to both numismatic and other iconography is the raised and prominent dorsal crest. Boars with such exaggerated bristles appear as central or peripheral motifs on the bronze coinage of Britain and Gaul.44 The boar-image superimposed on the torso of the Euffigneix statuette (see above) bears a similarly emphasized crest, as do the bronze boars from Bata in Hungary,45 Luncani in Romania,46 and Hounslow in southern England.47 Close scrutiny of figural art in Britain and elsewhere in temperate Europe reveals that, despite the absence of a strong tradition of mimetic depiction that is so dominant a feature of the Graeco-Roman artistic tradition, the pre-Roman Iron Age was by no means barren in terms of representative expression. It would, therefore, seem likely that the origin of Romano- British and Gaulish religious art, far from appearing by a sort of parthenogenesis, developed- at least in part - from traditions already in place before Roman culture and mores gained a foothold. ROMANO-BRITISH CULT-IMAGERY: THE ROMANIZATION FACTOR Martin Millett48 has argued convincingly that romanization involved a two-way process of culture-absorption and that the changes taking place in Britain following the conquest were by 36 Most ram-horned serpent motifs occur in eastern France, but images of the beast are recorded as far apart as Cirencester in western Britain and Gundestrup in Jutland: Lambrechts 1942, 45-63. 37 Allen 1980, pl. 23, nos 323, 350-1, 545. 38 Boon 1982. 39 Allen 1980, pl. 23, nos 335, 336; Allen 1976. 40 Allen 1980, pl. 25, nos 373-4. 41 Green 1989, 171-4, figs 76-7; Esp6randieu 1907-66, nos 3651I-9; Lambrechts 1942, 33-4. 42 Allen 1958, pl.

He further points to the Roman imperial system as essentially economically driven, with annexation closely associated with the demand for increased productivity and consumerism. If this is right, then we would not necessarily expect British (or Gaulish) religion to have been particularly targeted by Rome for conversion.49 It is profitable to look a little more closely at the mechanics of romanization and the adoption of romanitas. Millett presents us with a model which denies a heavy imperial hand but argues rather for a flexible approach to indigenous habits and customs.5o In areas where Roman rule was readily and peacefully accepted, the old late Iron Age social structures were not demolished but, rather, reinforced and the obvious, material signs of romanization architecture and the use of Roman consumer goods such as samian pottery, for instance were present because they served to replace the old, pre-Roman symbols of status (decorated war-gear, for example) that had largely disappeared under the new order.5' Millett sees the adoption of Roman traditions of stoneworking - whether for architectural or iconographic purposes - as a manifestation of romanitas which may not have extended further than the adoption of the stone masonry techniques themselves. According to this scenario, the religious themes selected for expression in the new medium do not necessarily have to rely on Classical inspiration, though they undoubtedly sometimes do. Moreover, just as the traditions involved in the building of the new Roman towns in the province probably derived not from the Roman military but rather from both the expertise of architects and craftsmen from Gaul and the impetus from the native aristocracy,52 so iconography may similarly owe part of its inspiration to the indigenous peoples of romanized Gaul rather than directly to the Classical world. In studying romanization in Britain, it is appropriate to focus on the Cotswold region occupied by the Dobunni, for it is this area that provides some of the best evidence for an iconographic tradition many of whose themes - for whatever reason show a lively independence from Mediterranean imagery. According to the testimony of the third-century historian Dio Cassius,53 the Bodounni (presumed to be the Dobunni) were won over to Rome as early as A.D. 43, and some accepted Roman domination without resistance. It has been suggested54 that such bloodless and peaceful submission reflects the probable presence of a client-king, whose interests lay in collaboration with the new power. Client kingdoms tended to prosper early under the Roman regime, as is demonstrated by the rapid development of the Regni in central southern England under King Cogidubnus (or Togidubnus).55 If at least part of the Dobunni were ruled by a client-king, this would go some way towards an explanation of why the material culture of the region evinces such relative prosperity from early in the Roman period, a wealth which reached its apogee in the great Cotswold villas, with their sumptuous mosaics, in the fourth century. For romanization to work most effectively, an area appears to have required the combination of a strong internal power-structure with an early and peaceful relationship with Rome. Interestingly, it is also the case that thoroughly romanized regions with access to a good supply of easily-worked stone tended to develop a rich local tradition of religious sculpture, whether or not the themes and styles of such iconography displayed overt Roman influence. 49 contra Webster 1995. 50 Millett 1990, 43. 51 Millett 1990, 112-17. 52 Jones 1991; Blagg 1991. 53 Dio Cassius, Roman History 60.19-20. 54 Millett 1990, I 12-17. 55 Millett 1995, 54.</page><page sequence="8">24 MIRANDA J. GREEN SCULPTORS IN ROMAN BRITAIN It is generally accepted that the bulk of stone carving in Roman Britain was the work of civilian masons who were either British or came from Gaul. In the Cotswold region of south- west Britain there is specific evidence for the identity of some sculptors: one whose work was dedicated at Uley was called Searigillus, son of Searix (both Celtic names) and his patron was Lovernius, again a Gaulish or British name.56 Henig has suggested that the name of the self- styled sculptor Sulinus, son of Brucetus, indicates his birth-place as Bath."' The stone-worker Priscus, who dedicated an altar to Sulis at Bath, was a Carnutian from near Chartres.58 Sculpture like the male 'Medusa', decorating the temple-pediment at Bath and displaying native, un-Classical iconographic features, demonstrates that indigenous traditions of imagery sometimes developed rapidly within civilian Britain.59 Despite the emphasis put by some scholars upon the introduction of new ways of religious offering in the Roman period involving, for the first time, the regular commissioning of sculptures by patrons,60 this may not have been so very different from the situation in Iron Age Britain and Europe, where patrons commissioned craftsmen to fashion complex artwork in gold and bronze.61 The Cotswold region developed a particularly fine tradition of figural carving, using a local limestone that was both readily available and tractable to work. Dobunnic craftsmen built upon the intrusive Roman traditions of monumental sculpture but quickly added distinctive styles of their own- schematism, triadism, emphasis on the head, richly patterned texturing of clothing and hair, the treatment of physiognomy, the addition of animal features to anthropomorphic images - that expressed their individuality rather than a mere parroting of Graeco-Roman mimetic custom, an independence which, at least in part, reflects the 'ways of seeing' experienced by their Iron Age antecedents.62 THE DOBUNNIC ICONOGRAPHIC TRADITION With their early acceptance of the Roman presence, a strongly Mediterranean bias in Romano- Dobunnic iconographic representation would perhaps be expected. It is, indeed, the case that the region has produced cult-imagery which betrays strong Classical influence, both in its naturalistic form of anthropomorphic depiction and in its religious themes. Thus, the relief- image of Mercury from the civitas-capital at Cirencester, which was carved according to Graeco-Roman sculptural orthodoxy, has been described by Jocelyn Toynbee as 'the finest relief of Mercury from the province. . .'.63 However, alongside such images as this, and the comparable representations of Mercury from the Romano-Dobunnic temple at Uley,64 Cirencester (together with other Dobunnic sites) has produced imagery which fits less easily into the fully romanized model. The sculptural repertoire of the Cotswolds exemplifies a cultural dynamic which can be recognized elsewhere in Britain, as in parts of Gaul, where native ways of expressing deity combined with the perceptions of the divine world which, as 56 Henig 1995, 109-18. 57 Henig 1995, 111-. 58 Cunliffe 1978, 30. 59 Henig 1993, xv-xvi. 60 Henig 1995, 76. 61 Stead 1985, 8-14; Green 1996, 21-53. 62 Green 1996, I15-49. 63 Toynbee 1964, 156, pl.

I have chosen three forms of cult-image occurring at Cirencester, or its environs, which illustrate the presence of influences external to Rome: Genii cucullati, the triple Mother- goddess (or Deae Matres), and the antlered god. Genii cucullati The cult-image known as the Genius cucullatus (the 'hooded spirit'), from its invariable depiction as a human figure dressed in a heavy hooded Gaulish sagum, has two main clusters of distribution in Britain: Hadrian's Wall65 and the Cotswolds.66 For a long time after Heichelheim's seminal study of cucullati, 67 there was thought to be a major dislocation of tradition associated with the representation of these figures in Britain, where the cucullatus appears most commonly in triadic form, and continental Europe, where the image is depicted as a single figure. However, recent discoveries at Pithiviers-le-Vieil (Loiret) show that in Gaul, too, the cucullatus could be represented in triple form.68 The triadic nature of the British cucullati, 69 together with their distinctive hooded sagum, proclaims the essentially Gallo-British character of their imagery. In the Cotswolds they frequently accompany seated female figures, generally interpreted as Mother-goddesses.70 The Genii cucullati provide an example of imagery that may well owe its presence to non-Classical progenesis, whether in Britain or in Gaul: the presence of pre-Roman coins bearing hooded figures and of wooden hooded images in Gaul (the latter perhaps representative of pilgrims rather than deities) dating to the first century B.C., have been noted above. Indeed, the hooded coat or cloak which is so characteristic of the cucullatus is more likely to reflect depiction of normal Gallo-British outdoor wear than of a ritually-significant garment, though it has been suggested7' that the hoods may represent the concept of hidden or shrouded representation, and therefore secrecy. It would appear that the dominance of 'Celtic' features of cucullatus- imagery (triadism and the sagum) argues strongly for its progenesis in Gaul or Britain, probably the former. The Deae Matres Like the cucullati, British images of the Deae Matres cluster in the Cotswolds and in the vicinity of Hadrian's Wall, but they are more widespread within Britain, with a significant presence in both Lincolnshire and London,72 and occur as far north as Scotland.73 In addition, there is abundant epigraphic evidence of their cult. Triadism is a significant feature of Mother- goddess imagery in both Britain and Gaul, although representations of single seated goddesses with emblems of fertility and abundance are also common. The iconography of the Matres in the Cotswold region, most notably in and around Cirencester, is of particular interest because of the persistent presence of triadism, even in instances where the goddess herself is depicted in single form. Thus, several Cirencester 65 Coulston and Phillips 1988, nos 152-6. 66 Henig 1993, nos 95-107. 67 Heichelheim 1935. 68 Deyts I993. 69 Green 1991. 70 e.g. Henig 1993, nos 101-4. 71 Claude Stercx, pers. comm.; Joseph Nechvatal, pers. comm. 72 Barnard 1985. 73 Keppie and Arnold 1984, no. 6I.</page><page sequence="10">26 MIRANDA J. GREEN sculptures74 depict a seated female figure accompanied by three cucullati; and a 'single mother' from the Ashcroft area of the city"7 bears three large apple-like fruits in her lap. Specific pre-Roman prototypes for the Mother-goddesses worshipped in Britain and Gaul are elusive, although the very late Iron Age female figurines from Henley Wood and Aust (see above) may have contributed to the later Mother-goddess tradition. The origins of the Mother- goddess cult in the Cotswolds, as elsewhere in Britain, are almost certainly to be found in Gaul. I cannot wholly agree with the view that the presence of the Matres in the Cirencester area was the result of their introduction from the Rhineland during the military phase of Roman occupation in south-west Britain,76 although three Mother-goddess depictions were found with an altar to the Suleviae (goddesses known in Gaul, Germany, and further east, as well as elsewhere in Britain). The Rhenish Matronae possess a distinctive imagery, not found in the Cotswolds, consisting of two mature women, wearing huge circular headdresses, seated one each side of a younger girl with long flowing hair.77 The sole example of a Rhenish-type Matrona known to me from Britain is the recently-discovered pipeclay statuette of a goddess with a large round headdress from Arrington, Cambridgeshire78 which, with other clay figurines, accompanied a coffined infant-burial. Moreover, the goddesses of the Rhenish group are invariably depicted with fruit, never with babies or children, whilst two images from Cirencester79 are depicted with toddlers and an infant respectively. If there is little apparent affinity between the representations of the Deae Matres in the Cotswolds and the Rhineland, there are much closer parallels between the Cirencester groups and some of the triple goddesses from non-frontier Gaul, notably Burgundy and the Rhane Valley.80 Given the undoubted presence of Gaulish craftsmen in the fledgling province of Britain as early as the mid-first century A.D. (see above), it is more than likely that these and other ex-patriots from Gaul brought both the cult and the imagery of the Deae Matres with them. The antlered god The third type of image selected for study is represented in the Cotswolds by a unique stone carving from Cirencester.81 It consists of a relief depicting a naked male figure with vestigial antlers, accompanied by two large ram-headed serpents, one of whose rearing bodies he grasps in each hand and whose sinuous forms curl down to meet beneath him, apparently replacing his legs. Above each snake's head, by the antlered head, is a multi-knobbed, circular object which has been interpreted as a rosette but which could equally well be a bunch of grapes or a cluster of coins in an open purse, small fruits, or ears of corn.82 Images of antlered anthropomorphic beings are rare in Britain but occur with relative frequency in parts of Roman Gaul, particularly in the North-East.83 The imagery is distinctive, not only in its mixture of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic elements but also in its repeated combination of antlers with ram-horned snakes:84 a stone from Sommer6court85 and a bronze 74 e.g. Henig 1993, nos IO2-3. 75 Henig 1993, no. 120. 76 contra Henig 1995, Io7-9. 77 Green 1989, 194-8. 78 Taylor 1993. 79 Henig 1993, nos 117-18. 80 For example Vertault in North Burgundy: Esperandieu 1907-66, nos 3373, 3377, 3378, and Lyon; Esperandieu 1907-66, no. 1742; Hatt 1986, 263; Green 1989, 191-4. 81 Henig 1993, no. 93; Green 1989, 93, fig. 39. 82 It is worth noting the presence of a second Dobunnic representation of a ram-headed snake, on an altar found at Bisley-with-Lypiatt, Glos.: Green 198 . 83 Bober 1951. 84 contra Henig 1993, discussion on entry no. 93. 85 Esperandieu 1907-66, no. 4839.</page><page sequence="11">GOD IN MAN'S IMAGE 27 figure from the vicinity of Autun in Burgundy86 each depict a deity seated cross-legged, with holes in the top of his head (presumably for the insertion of seasonally-removable antlers, which could have been metal, wood, bone, or even antler itself), entwined by a pair of ram- headed serpents. A stele from Vendoeuvres (Indre) depicts an antlered god, again seated cross- legged, flanked by two naked youths each with their feet on a writhing serpent."7 The fine relief carving from Rheims"8 depicts the antlered god enthroned between two Classical gods, Mercury and Apollo; he has no horned snakes but from an open bag on his lap streams a cascade of coins, grain, or fruit, similar attributes, perhaps, to those noted on the Cirencester relief. In addition to the firm Romano-Gaulish parallels to the Cirencester piece, there is good evidence for the pre-Roman origins of the iconography of the antlered god. The British Iron Age coin with his image has been mentioned above. Earliest are the petroglyphs at Val Camonica in the North Italian Alps near Brescia, dated to the seventh and fourth centuries B.C. respectively, which bear the image of a tall anthropomorphic figure, with well-defined antlers.89 Camunian rock-art has a long chronology, spanning a period from the fourth to the end of the first millennium B.C., when the Romans occupied the region. One of the inner plates of the great gilded silver cult-cauldron from Gundestrup in Jutland - generally dated to the first century B.C.- is decorated with an image of an antlered god: he grasps a ram-headed snake in one hand and a torc in the other.90 Denmark was, of course, never part of the Roman Empire and if, as is sometimes argued, the piece was Cimbrian loot from Gaul,91 it was made before the period of strong Roman influence in the area. Finally, it is interesting that the only epigraphic dedication to an antlered divinity belongs to an early phase in the Romano-Gaulish period: a stone block from a Parisian monument, of Tiberian date, is carved with the head and shoulders of an elderly bearded god, with stag-ears and a torc hanging from each antler; above is a worn inscription 'Cernunno' ('to the Horned/Peaked One').92 CONCLUSION This paper has attempted to show that the cult-iconography of Roman Britain may owe its presence to factors other than those directly associated with romanitas, and has sought to challenge the totality of a uni-directional 'Out of Rome' model by proposing additional or alternative theses. It is argued here that the existence of representative, figural art in pre- Roman Britain and Europe provided a contributory background to the iconographical tradition of both Gaul and Britain in the Roman period. Such an 'ancestral' model has two facets: firstly, it recognizes the existence of a dynamic and developing pre-Roman representative tradition from which cult-imagery could evolve within both Roman Gaul and Roman Britain; secondly, it is possible to distinguish particular figural forms which were established during the pre-Roman Iron Age and were absorbed, admittedly somewhat altered, within the repertoire of Romano-British (and Romano-Gaulish) artists and the expectations of their patrons. In addition to the explication of an 'ancestral' model, this paper also proposes an 'Out of Gaul' model, which interprets some of the imagery occurring in Roman Britain as the result of 86 Thevenot 1968, 144-9. 87 Esperandieu I907-66, no. 1539; Green 1989, fig. 40. 88 Esperandieu 1907-66, no. 3653. 89 Priuli 1985, 78-9; Priuli 1996, 29, fig. 5I. 90 Kaul 1991a, 21, fig. 15. 91 Kaul 199ggb. 92 Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum xIII, no. 3026; Esperandieu 1907-66, nos 3132-3; Duval I96I, 197-9.</page><page sequence="12">28 MIRANDA J. GREEN inspiration from the Romano-Gaulish iconographic tradition. The ultimate Classical influ- ences feeding into such a tradition are not denied, but it is argued that the appearance of certain representative themes in Britain may owe their affiliations to imagery coming from Gaul rather than directly from Italy. Study of some of the iconography produced by Romano- Gaulish sculptors demonstrates a close affinity between their repertoire and that of stone- workers in the Cotswolds. It is even possible that the burgeoning of new, non-Classical, cult- image-types, in both Britain and Gaul, may have been the result of a conscious attempt by indigenous populations - using the (largely) unfamiliar medium of representative icono- graphic expression - to make a positive and independent statement about their religion. There is a good example (albeit a modern one) of such a bid for cultural identity in the present- day perception of Wales as a Celtic land, a perception that was encouraged by Iolo Morgannwg and other Welshmen in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries."93 As with most problems of interpretative theory, it is probably unwise to try and fit the evidence of material culture into any single rigid framework; it is certainly a mistake, when dealing with cross-cultural interaction and hybridization, to present a uni-directional model of influences. Much of the indigenous cult-imagery of both Britain and Gaul during the Roman period was undoubtedly inspired by the long-standing mimetic traditions of Greece and Rome. But it is all too easy to undervalue and underestimate the likelihood of a two-way traffic in ideas that can be demonstrated, by scrutiny of more modern merged religious cultures, as having taken place in Roman Britain.
