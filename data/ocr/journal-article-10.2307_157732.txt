This article seeks to demonstrate the need to incorporate the international component of political strategy into analysis of the behaviour of democratising elites, a standpoint that too often has been neglected in democratisation theory. It explores a little-known aspect of Argentina's foreign policy that took place under the stewardship of the transitional democratic administration of President Raul Alfonsin (I983-1989). Specifically, it reveals that the first-freely elected administration that followed the Procesco military dictatorship articulated and implemented a strategy that aimed at defending and promoting democratic values in relation to Argentina's Southern Cone and Andean neighbours. Argentine bilateral relations with Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Chile are analysed through this analytical standpoint. It is argued that the Alfonsin government pursued such a policy out of a blend of fear for its own perpetuation and principled beliefs about the value of democracy as a mode of governance. With a country with new institutions, democracy and development, Argentina will bring a significant contribution to establish a more secure and fair international system... Bearing this idea in mind, I would like to make clear that our foreign policy will coherently mirror our domestic politics... We will seek social justice for Argentines and will not cease to look for ways to establish within the international system some aspects of morality and justice between nations. We will strive for peace for our violence-ridden territory and will seek peace for all inhabitants of this planet. We will seek freedom and democracy for the Argentines, with the resoluteness that provides the traumatic experience of living under authoritarianism and repression. We will fight for freedom and democracy throughout the world.

The emphasis on internal factors can easily be understood since the most important determinants of the success or failure of any democratisation process are located in the complex reconstruction of state-society relations making international factors generally secondary in importance.2 While some in-depth investigations have been conducted on the role and impact of the international dimension in helping or hindering the initiation of transitions to democracy in Latin America, there is a clear shortage of research about what Geoffrey Pridham has called the 'outer-inner' and 'inner-outer' linkages in the field of democratisation studies.3 Most analysis of the interplay between external factors and democratisation processes leaves us in the dark regarding the role of international variables in the design of comprehensive strategies of consolidation by democratising elites.4 It is, then, unsurprising that recent work has stressed the need to pay more attention to this dimension of the study of regime change from authoritarianism to democracy.5 Interest in investi- gating the international components of strategies of consolidation should 2 L.

It will detail how the UCR administration's foreign policy implemented a series of initiatives that aimed at defending and promoting democratic values in relation to Argentina's Southern Cone and Andean neighbours. The discussion of the UCR administration's efforts to diffuse democratic values highlights the underestimated role of the international dimension in what is generally perceived as an overwhelmingly domestic process of societal transformation. Although understudied, the impact of the international dimension on regime change from authoritarian to consolidated forms of democratic governance has been acknowledged for some time in the literature, and the link was explicitly recognised by some theoretical and empirical works that surveyed the Southern European and Latin American experience during the twentieth century's three waves of democratisation.7 The 6 For works stressing the correlation between domestic regime change, as embodied in democratisation processes, and foreign policy restructuring see Marcelo Lasagna, 'Las Determinantes Internas de la Politica Exterior; Un Tema Descuidado en la Teoria de la Politica Exterior', Estudios Internacionales, vol. 28, no.

In retrospect, initiatives such as Portugal's granting of independence to its African colonies, and the integration of the newly democratised Southern and former Soviet satellites into the European Community and NATO, all seem to have been manifestations of deliberate efforts by democratising elites to exploit the international dimension. As a number of Argentine specialists acknowledge, the Alfonsin administration is a case of regime change that underwent foreign policy restructuring to promote/protect the country's nascent set of democratic institutions.9 The Alfonsin administration's foreign policy platform was strongly inspired by the UCR's idealist frame of reference in international (Boulder, 1987), pp. 5-25; Francesco Bayo, 'La Democracia en la Politica Latinoamericana de Espafia,' Sintesis, no 21 (July-December 1994), pp. 75-I04; T.

In his view, democracy at the internal level and liberal international principles in foreign policy were two complementary and mutually reinforcing elements. Krause's liberal internationalist prescription had been wholeheartedly adopted by Ar- gentine Radicals and had become the trademark of the UCR's worldview since its foundation in 1890. Thus, it was likely to be a decisive influence in the way the Alfonsfn administration would shape its foreign policy after its victory at the polls."1 The importance of emphasising the interplay between the domestic and international dimensions also stems from the fact that, since the start of the authoritarian cycle in the 1930s, successive military regimes attempted to transform Argentina's foreign policy into an instrument for legitimising and perpetuating their practices and rules.'2 Under these circumstances, the UCR administration saw it as vital to reshape the country's international relations in a direction that would be compatible with the requirements of building a consolidated democracy and would neutralise any threat to the democratisation process itself.l3 Indeed, as a specialist of 10 Karl Christian Friedrich Krause was born at Eisenberg in 1781 and died in Munich in 1832. Like several of his contemporaries, Krause claimed to be developing the true Kantian position. In Krause's view, the ideal community is governed by the concept of right, which he defines as the organic whole of all of the internal and external conditions necessary for the completion of life that are dependent on freedom. In this view, the rights of individuals, groups, and nations can be recognised but only as subordinates to the Humanity as a whole. While not very influential in Germany, Krause's philosophy found considerable support in Spain and in Latin America at the end of the nineteenth century, coinciding with the time the UCR was founded.

This is a complex challenge. However, no doubt it is even more complex because the form that we have adopted to redress the situation corresponds to a particular model. We have chosen to work for the organisation of a democratic society.... In this perspective, the way that Argentina inserts itself into the world plays a fundamental role. Notably because external linkages will serve to integrate the democratic memory of the world into Argentina in a kind of accelerated apprenticeship of democratic forms... The type of international linkage and the efficiency with which we will be able to develop it are fundamentally important for the attainment of our internal objectives. Therefore, our foreign policy is articulated so as to strengthen our democratic system through an increase in our political autonomy in the international system, the incorporation of democratic values in our network of social relations, and the creation of conditions for the modernisation and improvement of our economic structures.15 The international component of the Alfonsin administration's strategy of democratic consolidation, which has been labelled by the UCR foreign policy team itself as the 'Twenty Fronts' and 'Membrane' strategies, became one of the main facets of Argentina's foreign policy from 1983 to I989, especially during the initial period of the Alfsonsin administration.16 In the mind of the alfonsinista foreign policy team, both the 'Twenty Fronts' and 'Membrane' strategies functioned as filters of the impact of international events while simultaneously allowing the domestic system to be permeated by positive elements conducive to the consolidation of democracy in Argentina. The first element of both the 'Twenty Fronts' and 'Membrane' strategies consisted of an activist posture by Argentina, seeking alliances and cooperation with other states interested in creating 'democratic fronts' in the international system.17 In addition, both 14 Russell, 'Los Ejes Estructurantes', p. 5. 15 La Nacion (Buenos Aires, 14 Aug.

(my translation). 16 The importance of protecting the nascent democratic project through Argentina's foreign policy was clearly spelled out post facto by Dante Caputo in 'Informe, Linea Conceptual y Hechos Fundamentales de la Politica Exterior del Radicalismo (I983-1989)', mimeo, 1990. Caputo reconfirmed this feature when he said that, in his view, 'the main foreign policy objective the UCR administration sought was to protect Argentina's nascent democratic institutions; a concern which carried an especially potent weight until I987'.

Striking examples of the two operational components could be observed in the Alfonsin administration's insistence on reshaping Argentina's relations with Western European countries, specifically in its successful attempts to incorporate cancellation clauses in cooperation treaties concluded with Spain in 1987 and Italy in 1988 to counter the possibility of a democratic interruption.18 The dual feature was equally discernible in initiatives that aimed to convince Argentina's Southern Cone and Andean neighbours either to inaugurate a process of democratisation or, when inaugurated, to enhance the viability of newly-established democracies in these states. The UCR's liberal internationalist foreign policy in the Southern Cone and the Andean Region Despite the euphoria when Alfonsin was inaugurated as president, a clear feeling of threat existed within the UCR government about the viability of the country's democratic institutions. Authoritarian practices might have been discredited but the most difficult part of the task of consolidating democratic institutions was still ahead, and the country's democratic future perspectives looked bleak when the UCR took over in December I983. For the UCR administration, perceptions of a regional threat came from two distinct, yet related elements. First, the Alfonsin administration launched its redemocratisation efforts when most neighbouring countries were still ruled by military regimes. It was feared that the region's authoritarian outlook could entice backward-looking sectors within the Argentine armed forces to draw on neighbouring authoritarian regimes to try to relegitimise their beliefs, values, and ultimately, return to power. Active support from these potentially hostile neighbours might help authoritarian-inclined elements to derail the Argentine democratisation 18 Graciela Fernandez, 'Las Relaciones Bilaterales Especiales de la Argentina', America Latina/Internacional, vol. 5 (Jan.-March 1988), p.

The perception that democratising Argentina was 'under siege', due to a hostile regional environment, appears to have been shared by the UCR foreign policy team as a whole: Undoubtedly, one of the main focuses of articulation in our foreign policy, at least during the initial period of the administration, dealt with our constant preoccupation to consolidate our democratic institutions which we perceived as weak and threatened by internal and external forces ... The context in which we came to power in i983 has to be remembered. Argentina was surrounded by countries in which possibilities of democratisation were either remote or very fragile. Bolivia had a fragile democratic government since i982; Uruguay was liberalising but had not yet started its own transition process. Similarly, Brazil had already begun to liberalise but we perceived this process as fragile and leaving too much power to the military. In Paraguay and Chile respectively, Stroessner was leading a sultanistic regime while Pinochet was firmly entrenched in power. We were besieged, and we did not like it as this situation could encourage sectors within our own population that had no respect for democracy, despite their proven incompetence, to seek to regain power.19 In this context, the 'Twenty Fronts' and 'Membrane' strategies became integral parts of Argentina's foreign policy towards its Southern Cone and Andean neighbours. Relations with these countries became characterised by a strong liberal internationalist outlook aimed at disseminating democratic values in the region. The first manifestation of this concern within the alfonsinista foreign policy was observable in the dramatic alteration of the nature of Argentina's relations with its most powerful neighbour: Brazil. Relations between Argentina and Brazil during the Alfonszn administration An important reason behind the change in relations with Brazil can be found in the fact that, from March I985, both countries were led by democratising elites who shared a belief that they needed a foreign policy to strengthen and integrate their respective strategies of consolidation. Argentina and Brazil, under the administration of Presidents Alfonsin and Sarney, began to build a binational community whose normative modus operandi and raison d'etre were based upon the existence and the strengthening of democratic institutions and practices. This innovative aspect within the Argentine-Brazilian bilateral relationship manifested 1 Author's interview with former Chairperson of the Argentine Congress' Lower House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Federico Storani, Nov. 1993, Buenos Aires.</page><page sequence="9">The Alfonsin administration 47 itself through the emergence of intensified foreign policy cooperation at the political level, and by a sustained effort at economic integration. The cooperative trend between Argentina and Brazil represented a dramatic reversal in the nature of the bilateral relationship which had hitherto been characterised by low intensity and deep suspicion. Distrust ran high between the two countries before the democratic thaw of the mid-I980s because Argentina and Brazil, particularly under authoritarian rule, tended to cast their perceptions about bilateral relations into a zero- sum game, based upon geopolitical considerations moulded by military thinking. Although the first manifestation of bilateral rapprochement took place when military regimes were still in power, the near-simultaneous reinstallation of democratising administrations marked the beginning of a new relationship. The election of the candidate of the democratic opposition in Brazil, Tancredo Neves, to the presidency created an environment highly conducive to improving bilateral cooperation. The Alfonsin administration had supported Neves' campaign and expected cooperation between the two countries to be bolstered by his victory.20 These expectations appear to be fulfilled when President-elect Neves made an official visit to Argentina in February I985, when it became clear that both leaders shared views about the link between the international environment, and Neves seemed willing to engage in a rapprochement with Argentina in order to pursue the consolidation of regional democracies.21 Understandably then Neves' untimely death in April I985, and his replacement by Jose Sarney stirred immediate fears in the Alfonsfn administration about the future of political cooperation and economic integration with Brazil.22 Sarney was not trusted by Alfonsin's foreign policy team, which argued that the new president belonged to a sector of the Brazilian oligarchy that could attempt to detain, or even derail, the democratisation process in his 20 According to Dante Caputo, several meetings took place between the Alfonsfn administration and members of the Brazilian democratic opposition, including Tancredo Neves the leader of the Partido da mobiliaaf?ao democrdtica brasileno, Ulisses Guimaraes, and the leader of the Partido trabalhista democrdtico, Leonel Brizola, before the democratic reinstallation of March I985.

Neves made clear during his visit that he shared with President Alfonsfn strong concerns about the external debt, the Central American conflict, and the North-South dichotomy. He also stressed that increased cooperation with Argentina on these matters seemed to be part of the solution for their eradication and democratic stability in the Americas. 22 On the UCR administration's initial reaction to Neves' death see Clarin, La Nacion (Buenos Aires, 23 April i985).</page><page sequence="10">48 Dominique Fournier own country.23 Consequently, the Alfonsin administration adopted a wait-and-see position before pursuing further rapprochement with Brazil, but it soon became apparent that alfonsinista apprehensions were ill- founded and that the new Brazilian president was committed to eliminate those problems slowing consolidation of democracies in the Southern Cone and Western hemisphere. This concern was especially discernible in Brazil's behaviour in relation to issues such as the East-West conflict, the Central American conflict, and the external debt crisis.24 The window of opportunity to enhance bilateral cooperation became especially noticeable when the two presidents met at Iguazui at the end of November 985 and agreed to a specific set of actions to promote in tandem political cooperation and economic integration.25 Many commentators agree that a strong concern for democratic protection in both Argentina and Brazil was pivotal to achieving the Iguazu agreement, which was subsequently embodied in the Argentine-Brazilian July I986 integration treaty.26 The presidential joint statement introducing the treaty stressed that one of the primary purposes was to help 'to consolidate democracy as a way of life and system of government' through enhanced economic integration.27 Former Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Jorge Sabato outlines the rationale behind this treaty. 23 Rail Alconada Sempe stressed that the UCR administration had been 'devastated' by Neves' death. In his opinion, this could have meant a serious setback to efforts at bilateral rapprochement. Suspicions about President Sarney's links with the oligarchy and some military sectors largely explained this attitude.

They were not so keen at the beginning, but there has been a sharp reversal coinciding with the coming to power of Sarney. From that moment onwards, they expressed the opinion that a community between Argentina and Brazil would protect democracy in both nations. They stressed the examples of the Spanish, Portuguese, and Greek post- authoritarian administrations which speeded up the integration process with the European Economic Community (EEC) because they believed that it was inconceivable that a EEC member be led by fascists. Consequently we always had this parallel between the EEC role and its influence upon the democratisation of Southern Europe in mind. But there was more than that; it was simply out of question that EEC members return to dictatorships. The I98I attempted coup in Spain partly failed because if it had succeeded, the EEC would have intervened to quell the process. We believed that the creation of a political and economic community between Argentina and Brazil could play the same role: a cooperative binational regime would contribute to the elimination of the risk that our respective states eventually return to the hands of the military.28 Presidents Alfonsin and Sarney were convinced that, with a common democratic project to articulate, their polities possessed converging political interests which could be expressed through cooperation in the international arena. As some authors have suggested, political motivation preceded a strict economic rationale in the minds of both administrations for furthering the institutionalisation of the bilateral relationship.29 The I986 integration treaty was seen as instrumental to delegitimise the so-called 'hypothesis of conflict' within the Argentine and Brazilian doctrines of national security that had been critical to foreign policy conceptualisation and legitimising authoritarianism during periods of military dictatorships. It was therefore no coincidence that the integration treaty was geared at enhancing cooperation in strategic matters. The treaty opened the door to a fundamental reinterpretation of the way both Argentina and Brazil defined their national security interests, in relation to each other, as well as their respective doctrines of national security - a dramatic change that can be observed in some protocols of the treaty that deal with strategic and security areas. Up to that point bilateral cooperation on such issues was seen as unconceivable. More specifically efforts to enhance inter-military cooperation can be observed in the dedication of a whole section of the treaty to bilateral 28 Interview with former Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister of Argentina Jorge Sabato, Oct. 1993, Buenos Aires.

The 1986 treaty began a major reversal of the dynamics of mutual suspicion by bringing the aeronautical sectors of the Argentine Ministry of Defence and the Empresa Brasilena de Aeronautica together in cooperative production of aircraft for both the military and civilian markets.30 This was complemented by confidence- building measures aiming at eliminating suspicions between the two national military institutions, such as an annual series of symposiums inaugurated in April 1987, to identify common strategic interests and to build bonds between the two armies.31 Even more spectacular was the move towards bilateral nuclear cooperation. Before March I985, strong military opposition in both countries made it politically impossible to implement the commitment of nuclear cooperation concluded by Presidents Videla and Figueiredo in May i98o.32 The November I985 declaration marked a watershed on this issue, endorsing the peaceful utilisation of nuclear energy while promising a closer cooperation in this field between the two countries. These efforts were consolidated by the creation of a Joint Working Ministerial Group and a group commissioned to improve cooperation between the Argentine and Brazilian nuclear industrial sectors.33 Cooperation was subsequently deepened by the incorporation into the 1986 integration treaty of a protocol to secure bilateral assistance in case of a nuclear emergency in one country.34 In December 1986 the two countries agreed to set up a system of reciprocal inspections and safeguard techniques of the other country's nuclear facilities, marking the first institutionalisation of confidence-building measures between the two countries.35 The bilateral security regime was symbolically boosted in July 1987 and November 1988 by the visits of Sarney to the Argentine nuclear plant of Picalniyeu and the Ezeiza radio chemical laboratory to increase Brazil's confidence in the non military purposes of the Argentine nuclear 30 Eduardo Gani, 'Tendencias en la Integraci6n Latinoamericana: el Caso de Argentina y Brasil', Cono Sur, vol. 7 (Jan-March 1988), p. 6. 31 The economic, political, and strategic impacts of the 1986 integration treaty in relation to the democratisation process were specifically examined by the Argentine and Brazilian military establishments during symposiums held in 1987 and 1988.

These visits were reciprocated, in April 1988, by an official tour by Alfonsin of Brazil's Aramar nuclear plant.36 A second set of linkages between democratic protection and the Argentine-Brazilian rapprochement can be found in what could be labelled as a set of 'economic incentives'. The UCR administration was convinced that economic integration with Brazil possessed a symbiotic relationship with the protection of the democratic project in Argentina. In fact, the alfonsinista administration firmly believed that democratic consolidation in Argentina was intimately linked to good performance by democratic institutions in the economic sphere; the I986 treaty was partly founded on the assumption by the UCR government that better integrated economic relations with Brazil could help to revitalise Argentina's declining economy.37 Indicative of the extent of change in terms of economic integration are the treaty's initial protocols which sought to promote economic liberalisation and contained preferential treatment clauses to stimulate trade and investment. It also included mechanisms to promote a balanced bilateral trade, notably through the purchase of Argentine wheat by Brazil and by the creation of a compensation mechanism in cases of serious trade imbalances or unfair practices.38 This pattern could subsequently be observed in the signature in I987 and I988 of additional protocols to extended cooperation to areas such as steel production, communications, maritime transport regulation, petro- chemicals, and science and technology.39 The list of protocols increased to 24 by the time President Alfonsin left office in July I989. 36 Roberto Russell, 'Argentina: las Relaciones con los Socios Previlegiados', America Latina/Internacional, vol. 6 (Jan-March i989), p. z22; R.

Many within the Argentine business community and political circles openly criticised the treaty's lack of effectiveness in overcoming structural problems, noting its failure significantly to increase bilateral trade40 or to offset the trade deficit with Brazil.41 There were also complaints that the treaty had created unclear rules on trade practices while the treaty's trade dispute mechanisms were seen by many as ineffective in protecting Argentine interests. In retrospect though, critics might have been too severe in their judgement. It should be remembered that many protocols had not yet been implemented, or had been active for such a short time that any kind of assessment on this aspect of Argentine- Brazilian bilateral relations was premature when the Alfonsin adminis- tration left office. The treaty's main accomplishment in the economic realm does not lie in an increase in bilateral trade but in the fact that it created the impetus and necessary nexus of institutions to allow for further regional integration in the Southern Cone through the creation of the Mercosur in 1991. Beyond this, it is in the political and diplomatic areas that the 1986 integration treaty experienced its most remarkable successes. It created a dramatic reversal of the Argentine and Brazilian 'hypotheses of conflict' and the rejection of decades of suspicion and rivalry to establish the basis for long-lasting bilateral cooperation.42 By extension, the Declaration of Iguazu and the 1986 integration treaty made a significant contribution, to the deepening of the civilianisation process by strengthening the position of democratising elites in both countries. In short, the 1986 treaty was a vital contribution to stabilizing the strategic and political environments for the new Argentine and Brazilian democracies. Argentine-Uruguayan Relations during the Alfonsin Administration During the 1983 electoral campaign, and in the first days of his administration, Alfonsin repeatedly showed his contempt for the Uruguayan military regime, in particular through a series of meetings with representatives of the democratic opposition and notably the Blanco and Colorado parties.43 Concrete support for a democratic transition in 40 In absolute numbers, Argentine-Brazilian bilateral trade climbed from US $I.Io6 billion in I985 to US $I.969 billion in 1989.

In fact, it has been alleged that there were frequent Argentine attempts to reduce differences between leaders about their respective roles and prerogatives in a post-authoritarian Uruguay.49 It is certainly the case that 44 C/ar/n, La Nacidn (Buenos Aires, 22-23 Dec.

Support by the Alfonsin administration for Ferreira Aldunate became even more obvious in the weeks following his arrest. The Argentine president sent roving ambassador, Senator Hipolito Solari Yrigoyen, to Uruguay to become one of the lawyers defending the Blanco leader during the trial the military authorities held against him after his return to Montevideo. 48 Clarin, La Nacion (Buenos Aires, 30 Oct.

The Alfonsin administration equally provided support to a meeting between leaders of the Uruguayan democratic opposition, which took place in the Argentine city of Concordia, during the first part of I984 to alleviate problems in the transition to democracy. The Uruguayan military regime officially protested about these inter- ferences. As the two officials recalled, the Alfonsfn administration denied these accusations at the time, but the military's suspicions in Montevideo were generally well founded.

The two countries were referred to as 'democracies of the Southern Atlantic', with which it was imperative to establish special linkages to protect the fate of democracy in the Southern Cone.52 The development of an 'elective affinity' with democratising Uruguay could be observed in the meetings that Alfonsin and Caputo held with President-elect Sanguinetti in December 1984 and in February and March i985 to discuss international issues, such as the external debt and the Central American conflict, which both sides believed greatly affected the prospects of building regional democracies.53 Mutual concern about the consolidation of democracy also led Presidents Alfonsin and Sanguinetti to meet in the town of Colonia in May 1985 and issue a statement guaranteeing their support for regional democracy pledging to intensify international cooperation.54 Foreign policy coordination was intensified in June i985 at a meeting between Presidents Alfonsfn, Sanguinetti, and Sarney in the Uruguayan beach resort of Punta del Este. The three presidents agreed that hemispheric political stability was linked to structural problems emerging from the international environment that needed to be addressed through increased foreign policy coordination and an informal type of' democratic alliance' that would include political and economic cooperation.55 Foreign 50 Jorge Sabato confirmed that some negotiations took place with the Uruguayan democratic opposition to, in his own words, 'reinforce the strength of the democratic movement against any attempt to institutionalise a tutelary democracy in Uruguay'.

Uruguay also endorsed several Argentine resolutions at the United Nations (UN) and the Organisation of American States (OAS) that requested the United Kingdom initiate talks on the future of the archipelago.58 At the same time, the Alfonsin and Sanguinetti administrations settled the long-standing territorial conflict about the Martin Garcia island.59 56 Clarin, La Nacidn (Buenos Aires, I6 Nov. i985; 22 Feb., I6 June 1986). 57 For references on Uruguayan foreign policy during the first Sanguinetti administration see Lincoln Bizzozero, 'La Politica Exterior del Uruguay en una Perspectiva Hist6rica', Sintesis, no. i3 (Jan.-April 1991), pp. 347-57; M.

Moreover, Uruguay condemned the British government's November 1986 decision to impose a I so-mile security zone around the Malvinas/Falklands islands and supported an Argentine resolution at the UN to condemn the move.

Although mainly focusing on the terms of Uruguayan admission into the developing Argentine-Brazilian economic integration scheme, the act strongly emphasised a common will to fuse democratic consolidation with the economic and cultural integration of the three countries.61 The integration process was deepened by the ratification, in September I987, of the Buenos Aires Act that covered economic cooperation in the fields of science, technology, and culture.62 The last significant stage on economic integration during the tenure of the Argentine and Uruguayan transitional administrations took place in November 1988 when Uruguay was officially integrated into what was subsequently to become the Mercosur.63 Relations between Alfonsin's Argentina and Stroessner's Paraguay The UCR administration's rejection of President Stroessner was mainly based on his authoritarian approach to politics. As an Argentine policy maker of the period indicated: We were highly suspicious of Stroessner's intentions about our political project. He was far from friendly. It should be remembered that he had close connections with the military that had been responsible for the Dirty War and that these links did not evaporate after we took office. He had especially good links in the provinces of Chaco and Formosa with the oligarchic families that were the potentates of these regions and were opposed to democratisation as they had hugely profited from the Proceso years. Of course, we feared some kind of destabilisation process in these provinces and this had to be stopped. In our own eyes, getting rid of Stroessner, through pacific means, was part of the solution.64 Argentine attempts to encourage a democratic transition in Paraguay took several forms, including protest at the violations of the human and 60 Clarin, La Nacidn (Buenos Aires, 20 May I985). 61 Clar/n, La Nacidn (Buenos Aires, 27 May 1987).

The diplomatic deadlock led Buenos Aires to condemn the repression and imprisonment of some leaders of the MOPOCO, one of the signatory 65 Leandro Despouy underlined that President Alfonsin refused to receive Paraguayan Ambassador Rivera Posada for more than a year to protest against human rights violations in his country.

Alfonsin cancelled a meeting with Stroessner, seriously considered the expulsion of the Paraguayan ambassador and breaking off diplomatic relations.74 Relations between the two countries remained strained throughout 1987, as Paraguay refused to extradite some former Argentine military officers suspected of having illegally adopted children of people disappeared during the Dirty War.75 Some Paraguayan diplomatic sources suggest that incidents at the borders almost brought the two countries to armed conflict.76 The Stroessner regime stepped up its condemnation of Argentine interference in the Paraguayan political process and, in veiled terms, threatened a destabilisation of the latter's redemocratisation process with the 'assistance' of friends living in Argentina.7 From 1986, the Alfonsin administration repeatedly attempted to convince the Brazilian government that Stroessner had to be toppled, but it encountered problems in this since the Paraguayan dictator had always been a very dependable client to Brasilia. Apparently, it took one year of intense lobbying to convince Brazil that a democratisation process had to be initiated in Paraguay.78 In parallel, according to some sources, 72 Clarin, La Nacion (Buenos Aires, 6, 8, I , I6 Oct.

This further enticed the UCR adminis- tration to give a helping hand to both constitutional authorities in La Paz and the democratic opposition.94 Former dictator General Hugo Banzer had won the first round in July I985 with 28.6% of the votes and therefore was the favourite candidate to win the run-off that was to take place in the Bolivian Congress the following month. Banzer's return to power was highly disapproved of by the UCR administration since, despite his democratic garb, he threatened a backdoor reintroduction of authoritarianism in Bolivia. Therefore, Argentina actively attempted to influence the August I985 run off vote by encouraging democratic forces to water down their differences and attempting to unify them into a common coalition to weaken Banzer's chances of being selected by Congress members.95 Moreover, it seems that the Argentine assistance did not limit itself to matters of a moral or purely logistical nature.96 I went to Bolivia with a letter under the specific request of President Alfonsin. This letter was directed at the various Bolivian democratic leaders: Paz Estenssoro, Siles Zuazo, Paz Zamora, urging them to overcome their differences since internal disputes within the democratic family would contribute to Banzer's project to reinstall an authoritarian regime under a democratic fasade. I urged them to present a united front against Banzer and affirmed that Argentina was willing to help them. Of course our support was mainly of a moral type; but also we sent them propaganda material that could be distributed to the Bolivian people, and helped them financially. Alfonsin used me on this matter because it had to be done through political emissaries and not through official channels. It would have been too risky to use the state's channels since it was a blatant encroachment on Bolivia's internal politics. Considering the state of flux of our own democracy at the time, the impact of making public the Bolivian operation would have contributed to stir up a debate in Argentina that would have helped the people with whom Banzer had contacts within our borders: the military and right-wing Peronists. Of course, Caputo knew about that and approved the operation.97 94 See Clarin, La Nacion (Buenos Aires, 30 Dec. 1984; i8 Jan. 1985); M.

At the political level, Argentina provided support to Bolivian territorial claims against Chile for access to the Pacific ocean, and voted in many multilateral fora, such as the UN and the OAS, in favour of resolutions presented by La Paz on this issue.98 The Argentine support for Bolivian claims was matched by the Paz Estenssoro administration, Bolivia voting for various resolutions that Argentina presented at the UN and the OAS on the Malvinas/Falklands islands in 1985, 1986, and I987.99 In addition, the Paz Estenssoro administration publicly supported the Alfonsin government when it was confronted by military rebellions in April 1987 and in January and December i988.100 On the economic front, Alfonsin ordered the payment of Argentine arrears in its importation of gas from Bolivia, and directed the ministry of economic affairs to facilitate reimbursement of the debt contracted by the Garcia Meza dictatorship with Argentina. Buenos Aires also granted a $400 million credit line to Bolivia to buy food and manufactured goods.10l Alfonsin accepted President Siles Zuazo's plea for Argentina to buy Bolivian gas at almost twice the international market price in order to boost that country's capabilities to buy technology and to finance some social services for the poorest sections of its population.102 In subsequent years, the price of Bolivia's gas exports would become a strong irritant in bilateral relationship as Argentina's own economic hardships made its attempts at democratic consolidation even more 98 Argentina voted for a resolution on Bolivia's territorial claims during the Harare 1986 and Georgetown I987 summits of the Non-Aligned Movement.

Argentina lowered its gas price to US $3.70 per M3 at a time when the international price was around US $2.20 per M3.</page><page sequence="25">The Alfonsin administration 63 precarious. The UCR administration repeatedly requested from Bolivia a revision of the gas agreement to relieve Argentina of some costs entailed by its importation of energy. In September 1987, after several months of discussion, a new comprehensive agreement was signed which reduced the price of gas importations for Argentina and rescheduled its reimbursement timetable. In exchange Bolivia saw its obligation to buy Argentine products with the proceeds of its gas sales substantially reduced.103 Although the Argentine-Bolivian bilateral relationship was not completely harmonious when the UCR administration left office, it can be said that the noticeable rapprochement that had obtained was more than partly due to the simultaneous processes of democratisation. The Alfonsin administration and Pinochet's Chile General Pinochet seemed to be well entrenched in power when Alfonsin entered office, and Argentine democratisers were troubled by the Chilean dictatorship's stubborn refusal either to liberalise or democratise the country's political system, which represented a direct threat for the consolidation of Argentine democracy. Members of the UCR adminis- tration vividly remembered the domestic political context in which General Galtieri had launched the 1982 Malvinas/Falklands war against the United Kingdom. They feared that General Pinochet could be tempted to use his foreign policy as a strategy of fuite en avant to keep control over the political process if demands for democratisation became too strong.104 Any upgrading of the 'hypothesis of conflict' within Chile's foreign policy could potentially generate in reaction a relegitimisation of the Argentine military's own National Security Doctrine, and of its methodology in dealing with state-society relations.105 Hence, it became imperative to devise a series of initiatives with the dual function of deflecting this potential threat from the trans-Andean neighbour, while encouraging the dissemination of democratic values in Chile. 103 The I987 agreement granted favourable conditions to Bolivia to reimburse its debt through a ten-year period. This would be then followed by a fifteen-year period during which Bolivia would pay an 8 % annual interest rate which was much lower than private foreign banks requested from the country at the time. In addition, the Argentine requirement that 6o% of the money Bolivia earned through the gas arrangement served to buy Argentine products was lowered to 20%.

I993, Buenos Aires.</page><page sequence="26">64 Dominique Fournier The first facet of the UCR strategy aimed at easing bilateral relations to encourage Pinochet to launch a democratic transition. In this context, it was imperative to avoid any Argentine action that could provide the dictator with justification to reject a political thaw in Chile; the Alfonsin administration's eagerness to solve the Beagle channel territorial conflict became one of the key pieces of this strategy.106 Indeed, the search for a resolution to the territorial dispute with Chile can, to a significant extent, be explained by the concern to build a more conducive external environment for the Argentine democratisation process as well as reducing the risk of a military confrontation between the two countries.107 The UCR foreign policy team hoped that the settlement of the Beagle dispute would build confidence and cooperation in the field of national defence as well as reducing the autonomy and popular support of the military institution.108 According to some members of the team, the resolution of the Beagle channel dispute was considered so pivotal that its failure would have jeopardised almost every aspect of the consolidation strategy that the administration was attempting to articulate through its foreign policy.'09 Caputo himself suggested that the fate of democratic consolidation in Argentina was inextricably linked to the Beagle channel dispute: The possibility of an armed conflict with Chile is one of the factors that threatens democratic consolidation in Argentina and has considerable influence on the 106 It is revealing that both the Argentine and Chilean democratic opposition saw a connection between the settlement of the Beagle territorial dispute and the launching of a democratic transition in Chile. A few months before the Alfonsin administration's inauguration, the Argentine and Chilean democratic oppositions jointly met and requested their respective military governments to reopen negotiations on the Beagle channel. It is clear from the August I983 joint statement that they linked this foreign policy initiative with the strengthening of eventual democratisation processes in their respective countries. See Clarin, La Nacidn, La Prensa (Buenos Aires, i6 May, 7 June, 23-24 Aug. I983). 107 Representative of this way of thinking is a statement made by the then Argentine Minister of the Interior, Antonio Troccoli, in the midst of the Beagle channel treaty negotiations. Troccoli stated that, 'the dispute must be settled as soon as possible since the stalemate only provides an excuse for the Argentine and Chilean military to rearm, to fuel tensions within both societies, and to endanger the evolution of the democratic experiment Argentina has undertaken since I983. On Troccoli's statement see Clar/n (Buenos Aires, 28 Sept. 1984). 108 Author's interviews with Jose Paradiso, professor of sociology at the University of San Andres and Rut Diamint, advisor at the Argentine Ministry of Defence, Oct. i995, Buenos Aires. In Paradiso's mind, the Beagle channel initiative was partly undertaken to eventually force the military institution to accept civilian supremacy by reducing its autonomy and severing the link with nationalist elements within civil society. 109 Francisco Diez, 'Criterios Rectores de la Politica Exterior del Gobierno de la UCR', America Latina/Internacional, vol. 4 (April-June I987), p. III.</page><page sequence="27">The Alfonsin administration 65 possible resurrection of democracy in our trans-Andean neighbour... One example of this lies in the need to reduce military expenditures to spend more on social and welfare services in Argentina. This depends, among other factors, on reaching an agreement with Chile about the dispute concerning our southern borders.110 During the I983 electoral campaign, Alfonsin had indicated that it would be a priority of a UCR administration to solve the Beagle channel dispute.11 This pledge became reality when, less than six weeks after his inauguration, Argentina signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation with Chile in which they agreed to negotiate over the dispute."l2 Those negotiations were arduous because of the staunch opposition among nationalist sectors in both countries. As well as the high level of distrust between Argentine and Chilean diplomats,1l3 To overcome this, the Alfonsin administration used other foreign policy initiates to build a confidence-building dynamic. According to a senior UCR government official, Argentina was eager to see Chile invited to the founding meeting of the Cartagena Consensur group on foreign debt since it perceived a link between the latter's integration and negotiations on the Beagle channel. The next government in Buenos Aires hoped that closer collaboration about the external debt issue between Argentine and Chilean diplomats would help them to know and appreciate each other better, to establish a dialogue, and to eliminate mutual suspicions. Consequently, Argentina pressured, and eventually convinced, reluctant countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela to allow Chile to participate in the founding meeting of the group in June I984.114 The ratification in May I985 of a treaty settling the Beagle channel dispute helped to satisfy one critical objective of the Alfonsin 110 Interview with Caputo in La Prensa (Buenos Aires, 14 Dec. I983). Cl Clarin, La Nacidn (Buenos Aires, 24 Aug., 26, 28 Oct. 1983). 112 Clarin, La Nacion (Buenos Aires, 24 Jan. 1984). 113 For instance, the Alfonsin administration encountered strong opposition to the proposed settlement with Chile from nationalist elements of the Peronist Party. Although the nationalist opposition was subsequently discredited during a televised debate, it remained a serious obstacle to the initiative since the opposition controlled the treaty ratification process through its majority in the Senate. The seriousness of the nationalist threat became obvious when the Senate ratified the treaty by only one vote. In addition to the nationalist opposition, some military elements resisted the UCR administration's initiative with Chile. Former President and Vice-President General Roberto Levingstone and Admiral Isaac Rojas criticised the treaty and attempted to organise the opposition against it. On the nationalist/Peronist opposition to the Beagle treaty before the November 1984 plebiscite see Clarin, La Nacion (Buenos Aires, 12, 18 Sept.; 23, 27 Oct.; I, 3, 5, 8, i6 Nov. 1984).

This was clearly limited by the fact that they did not share the same political values and inclinations."7 Collaboration between Presidents Alfonsin and Pinochet never gained the intensity, let alone warmth, which developed between the Argentine president and other Latin American democratising leaders."8 Alfonsin declared that Argentine-Chilean relations, although being very 'cordial', could only be normalised after a democratic transition had taken place in Chile. In sharp contrast with increasing political and economic rapprochement with Brazil, Uruguay and Bolivia during his administration, President Alfonsin repeatedly rejected the possibility of deepening economic integration with Chile, despite the creation in I985 of a binational economic commission, without prior democratisation in that country.19 In sharp contrast with increasing political and economic rapproche- ment with Brazil, Uruguay and Bolivia during his administration, President Alfonsin repeatedly rejected the possibility of deepening economic integration with Chile, despite the creation in 1985 of a binational economic commission, without prior democratisation in that country. A second aspect of the campaign to convince Pinochet to democratise the Chilean political system involved encouragement of internal political conditions that would directly eliminate obstacles for the inauguration of a process of democratic transition in Chile. For the UCR foreign policy makers, Pinochet's refusal to engage in a political opening could 115 On the treaty ratification see Clarin, La ATacidn (Buenos Aires, I5 May I985). 116 Clarn, La Nacidn (Buenos Aires, 10, 12, I4 May, i, i6 July i986); Southern Cone Report (London, 23 May 1986). 117 G. M. Figari, Argentina y America Latina: conflictosj cooperacidn (Buenos Aires, I991), p. 66. 118 One example of this can be found in the fact that Argentina seemed to show hostility to some aspects of Chile's foreign policy during the period under study. For instance, Argentina voted for the Bolivian request during the I986 and 1987 Luanda and Georgetown Non Aligned Movement summits for a territorial concession from Chile to endow Bolivia with a sea outlet.

Pinochet was absolutely unwilling to negotiate and he had a perfect domestic environment for being so intransigent. The opposition was very divided and the repressive apparatus had almost disarticulated Chilean civil society, at least during the initial period of our administration... Although we became aware of this potential danger long before the Americans, we shared the Reagan administration's fears that Pinochet could be overwhelmed on his left; that an insurrection could take place and that it could succeed! ... We were also afraid of the consequences of increased guerrilla activities in Chile. These movements could seek to use Argentina as a sanctuary with, as a consequence, all the possible ways of retaliation that Pinochet could use against our country if such a situation arose.l20 In this context, contacts were established with several sectors of Chilean society favourable to democratisation, and there are some indications that the Alfonsin administration undertook discussions with blando sectors of the military to see whether they could convince Pinochet to initiate a liberalisation process in Chile.'21 Nevertheless, most Argentine efforts to unlock the Chilean political stalemate were geared to convincing the main democratic opposition sectors- notably the Christian Democratic Party - to engage in pact-making and initiate a dialogue with the Communists to present a unified front against Pinochet. A second line of action consisted of initiatives aimed at deactivating Chile's leftist guerrilla. During 1984 and I985, the Argentine ambassador to Chile, Jose Alvarez de Toledo, received specific orders from Alfonsin himself to negotiate with the leaders of the Christian Democratic, Socialist, and Radical parties over how they might unify their position and engage in some kind of alliance to force Pinochet into accepting a dialogue.122 There is evidence 120 Author's interview with Jorge Sabato, Oct. 1993, Buenos Aires. 121 It is alleged that communications were established in December i985 between the Argentine administration and the military governor of the izth region, General Luis Danus, because of his public tilt towards political liberalisation in Chile. According to El Mercurio, there had been some discussions between Argentine authorities and General Danus about the possibility of requesting a meeting with General Pinochet in which Danus would have appealed for a liberalisation of the Chilean political process. See El Mercurio (Santiago, 20 Dec. I985). 122 Accounts of meetings in Argentina and Chile between Argentine officials and representatives of the Chilean democratic opposition existed during the whole length of the UCR administration's mandate.

This strategy was undertaken because the UCR administration firmly believed that no political solution could be negotiated in Chile if the Communist Party was excluded from the process, particularly because of its potential influence in convincing the Frente Patridtico Manuel Rodrigueg to withdraw its call for an armed insurrection against the Pinochet regime.124 It has been alleged that in January 1986, a secret meeting was held in the Argentine embassy in Santiago between leaders of the National Accord and the Chilean Communist Party to explore ways for the latter to join this political agreement. The meeting allowed leaders of the democratic opposition to search with the Chilean Communist Party for ways of deactivating the guerrilla.125 This meeting was followed by another, in 1987, when a secret emissary of President Alfonsin went to Chile to hold talks with leaders of the democratic opposition and the Frente Patridtico Manuel Rodrzgueg. Discussions revolved around the way to reach a common strategy involving communist participation in the National Accord, and the ending of the armed struggle.126 A UCR parliamentary delegation met with leaders of the Chilean democratic opposition in September I986, on the eve of the thirteenth anniversary of the military coup, to express solidarity with the Chilean people and a prompt return to constitutional politics.127 During the same 123 Alconada Sempe underlined that as in Uruguay, there was a 'shuttle diplomacy' going on between the Argentine ambassador in Santiago and the democratic opposition to set up rules that would allow its unification to fight against authoritarianism in Chile'.

Federico Storani revealed that he was the secret emissary Alfonsin had sent to Chile to negotiate with the democratic opposition and the Frente Patriotico Manual Rodrigueg. After his return, Storani suggested to President Alfonsin that Argentina should improve its relations with Chile to deny the Pinochet regime any excuse to disregard a democratic exit on the account that the nation was threatened by external elements.

The dictator hardened his stance against any kind of democratic exit, and the Alfonsin administration feared a resurgence in guerrilla activism, which could contribute to destabilise the Argentine democratisation experiment. Alfonsin and Caputo publicly stressed their deep concern that violent actions from the Chilean armed guerrilla could eventually 'spill over and seriously endanger Argentina's own security' and the government condemned the action by the Frente Patridtico Manuel Rodr/gue..129 At the same time, though, it also condemned the imposition of a state of siege by the dictatorship. A resolution of the Argentine Congress giving 'support to the Chilean people in its search for an immediate and unlimited return to democracy' was adopted with President Alfonsin's explicit approval.130 The UCR administration engaged in discussions with foreign powers on the means to advance democratisation in Chile. Some issues were raised with the Gonzalez government during Alfonsin's October 1985 official visit to Spain and a dialogue was begun with the Soviet Union and Cuba, which were suspected of financing guerrilla activities in Chile.131 During Alfonsin's visit to the Soviet Union in October I986 he sought to persuade President Gorbachev the need to stop financing the activities of the Leftist guerrilla in El Salvador and Chile to unlock the political stalemate in the two countries. Gorbachev is said to have replied that this request should be addressed to the real source of financing of the guerrilla's activities in Latin America: Cuba.l32 Consequently, during a supposed technical stop-over in Havana, Alfonsin asked the Cuban leader to stop financing guerrilla activities in Chile since it endangered the country's chances of launching a redemocratisation process.133 In addition, 128 Clarin La Nacidn (Buenos Aires, Iz Sept. 1986). 129 Clarin, La Nacion (Buenos Aires, 13 Sept.

See La Epoca (Santiago, IO June I991).</page><page sequence="32">70 Dominique Fournier Alfonsin stressed the dangerous impact that Cuban-financed activities in Chile had for Argentina's own efforts to redemocratise. Alfonsin's visit to Cuba was vividly recalled by Raul Alconada Sempe: During his stay, Alfonsin discussed the issue of the leftist guerrilla in Latin America with Castro. He asked him to change his strategy in Chile and in Central America and to stop assisting leftist guerrilla if they would support electoral politics. We also explained to the Cuban leader that we believed that Cuba had a right to be itself, that the US embargo was reprehensible and that we agreed with the fact that his country should have political space in the hemisphere; but we stressed that leftist attacks should be eliminated. Otherwise Pinochet and the junta in El Salvador could never be mollified. Alfonsin equally said to Castro. 'I must be straightforward: whether or not it is in the Chilean guerrilla's project, its activity will negatively affect Argentina. To me it is intolerable that our democracy let water in from all sides.' Castro said that he understood and that he was going to do something about it.134 Negotiations about Cuba's financing of the guerrilla went on for some time after Alfonsin's visit to Castro. It has been reported that in June 1987, Caputo invited Cuba's ambassador in Argentina, Santiago Diaz Paz, to a meeting in which they discussed ways to diminish the danger coming from the Chilean guerrillas, and to secure a democratic exit in Chile.135 It is possible that Argentina offered some diplomatic trade-off to convince Cuba to cease financing guerrilla activities in the Southern Cone; according to one source President Alfonsin requested the United States to ensure that Cuba be able to reenter into the OAS.136 If so, this could explain the rationale of the Alfonsin administration in voting against those US resolutions in I987 and 1988 at the UNCHR in Geneva that condemned Cuba for its human rights violations: Our commitment to the Cubans partially explains our attitude in Geneva with the I987 and 1988 American resolutions presented to the UNCHR to condemn Cuba for its poor human rights record. We believed that Cuba had to be rewarded for the decisions it could potentially take concerning the Frente Rodriguez and the Farabundo Marti. Our move was also linked to the fact that we did not like the fact that the Americans were using this UN body for mere political objectives at 134 Author's Interviews with Rauil Alconada Sempe, Nov. 1993 (Buenos Aires) President Alfonsin personally confirmed that he had discussions with Castro about the unfriendly attitude of the Argentine Communist Party towards his administration and democratic institutions in his country.

The flow of communication between the two countries about Chile had existed since the Alfonsfn administration was inaugurated in 1983, but it became especially intense in I985, when the Reagan administration started to believe that Pinochet could be toppled by a Communist insurrection.'38 Several meetings took place between Argentine officials and Secretary of State George Schultz to discuss the Chilean issue. Alconada Semp6 recorded these meetings as having been difficult, mainly because of the Reagan administration's intransigence on the issue of the Chilean Communist Party being part of the negotiation process: I had many discussions over the phone with my American counterparts on the situation in Central America, Chile, and Paraguay. We also had two formal meetings specifically about the Central American and Chilean situations with American officials: one in March 1985, coinciding with President Alfonsin's visit to Washington, and the other during the fall of I986. The first was a complete failure. Schultz showed up, we took pictures and then he vanished. We then talked to some American officials. We had brought maps and magazines about Central America and Chile. The Americans told us that the documentation did not matter because they made politics in the region... The second meeting was more productive. Schultz stayed for the whole time and actively participated in the discussion. I think that he really tried to understand our point of view and indicate that he saw us as a potential interlocutor in the Central American conflict and with Pinochet. However, he was adamant in his refusal that Communists be integrated into the dialogue process in Chile... However, at the end of the meeting, we had the impression that he had somewhat changed his mind about this matter.139 Bilateral cooperation on this topic also included a series of discussions between various officials of the Argentine administration and the Under- secretary of State for Interamerican Affairs, Elliot Abrams.l40 Discussions 137 See on the Argentine vote against American resolutions at the UNCHR about the situation of human rights in Cuba.

He even suggested that his administration could eventually modify some initiatives within its foreign policy - most notably some aspects of Argentina's policy toward Sandinista Nicaragua that irritated the United States, in order to achieve collaboration on this objective. Alfonsin's willingness to compromise could be observed during his last official meeting with President Reagan in November 1986, demonstrating the importance of Chile to his foreign policy.141 Finally, the administration actively supported the 'No' campaign during the October 1988 plebiscite that led to the ending of authoritarianism in Chile.142 Alfonsin later received representatives of the Concertacidn coalition to discuss the ways to achieve a victory at the coming presidential election and a resilient democratisation in Chile.143 After October 1988, the Argentine president made a gesture to boost Chilean democratic forces on the international stage by supporting Chile's admission as an observer to the Rio Group meeting that took place in Punta del Este three weeks after the plebiscite.144 Conclusions The Alfonsin administration's integration of the international dimension in its strategy of democratic consolidation manifested itself in several ways between 1983 and I989. As far as Argentina's immediate regional environment was concerned, the transformation of the international dimension into a instrument to strengthen nascent democratic institutions gave birth to a fundamental reshaping of the country's relations with its Southern Cone and Andean neighbours. The alfonsinista vision represented a watershed development in the way interactions between domestic and foreign politics were envisioned in Latin America. In sharp contrast to foreign policy practices under the Proceso regime of 1976-1983 and of its more distant authoritarian predecessors, Alfonsin's strategy vis-a-vis Argentina's Southern Cone and Andean neighbours was based on a 141 Clarin, La Nacin, La Prensa (Buenos Aires, I8 Nov. I986; 9 Jan. I987). 142 On the Alfonsin administration is support to the 'No' side in the Chilean 1988 plebiscite see La Nacidn (Buenos Aires, i6 June, 30 July, 2 Oct. I988). According to Leandro Despouy, the Alfonsfn administration provided some financial assistance to the 'No' side during the 1988 plebiscite in Chile. For instance, it paid for several buses of Chilean exiles in Argentina, who were overwhelmingly against the maintenance of Pinochet in power, to return to Chile and vote in the plebiscite.

Guided by this idealist compass, the Argentine democratising government sought, through various initiatives, to bring to the fore the defence and promotion of democratic values as a normative priority in the country's foreign policy. The change was substantive in scope and had a direct, though still largely unacknowledged, impact on the evolution of relations between Latin American states. It could be argued that the alfonsinista foreign policy opened a window of opportunity in inter-American relations, heralding the metamorphosis of the Hobbesian environment that had for so long hindered coopera- tion and hampered progress in hemispheric relations. Partly because of the UCR government's daring initiatives, antagonistic and counter- productive ways of articulating bilateral and multilateral interactions were slowly discarded, giving way to policies predicated on mutual advantage and cooperation. Soon after its inauguration, the Alfonsin administration ended Argentina's isolation on the international and regional stages that had peaked with the Malvinas/Falklands War of I982. Immediately after its inauguration, the government engaged in constructive relations with like-minded neighbours. The implementation of the alfonsinista foreign policy programme was facilitated by changes taking place in Argentina's immediate external environment. In the months preceding or following the Alfonsin administration's inaug- uration, many countries adjoining Argentina underwent democratic transitions of their own, installing administrations determined to institutionalise democratic institutions in their respective countries. The March i985 emergence of simultaneous transitional democratic govern- ments in Uruguay and Brazil provided a critical mass of committed democratic institutions in the Southern Cone. It created, to use Emanuel Adler and Peter M. Haas' expression, a nascent epistemic community of democratic leaders, that shared similar preoccupations and goals and who consequently agreed to coordinate action on a series of international issues deemed important for domestic processes of democratic consolidation. The degree of consensus among these leaders, let alone their willingness to coordinate foreign policy, was unprecedented at the time in Latin American history. The direct lineage between the UCR administration's strategy of espousing a policy of protecting and promoting democracy when dealing with Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay - a feature that incidentally could also be observed in Argentina's relations with other areas of the world during that period - has some important implications for the study of international relations and for the literature on democratisation. The analysis of Argentine state behaviour under the</page><page sequence="36">74 Dominique Fournier Alfonsin administration supports the proposition that domestic regime change, as embodied by this specific case from an authoritarian to a democratic form of governance, impacts upon the manner in which foreign policy is articulated and implemented. The Argentine experience of 1983-1989 also suggests that the international dimension might be a more important variable than generally thought in domestic strategies aiming at consolidating nascent democratic institutions. It is also suggested here that the traditional literature on democratisation studies and international relations frameworks have complementary limitations which must be overcome in order to reach a satisfactory understanding of the elements that can lead to democratic consolidation. Hence, both students of democratisation processes and international relations should consider expanding their scope of investigation to develop a still largely uncharted level of analysis that would examine the impact of foreign influences on the performance of local democratising elites and governments in achieving political transformation.</page></plain_text>
