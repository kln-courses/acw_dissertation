<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 83  Sacred Uncertainty:  Hope, Fear, and the Quest for  Transcendence   Jennifer Woodhull   University of Cape Town   Abstract  Myth and religion have historically been driven by a quest for certainty,  in the form of understanding, control, or both. This article contrasts  the thinking of Ken Wilber and Chögyam Trungpa in examining the  origins of this quest in the development of individual consciousness,  and in assessing the central role of hope and fear in the pursuit of  certainty. In the process, it explores the relationship of hope, fear,  and certainty to both the notion of God and the experience of the  physical body. Finally, this article locates in the works of both thinkers  the establishment and maintenance of an illusory self as grasping at a  primal form of certainty, and a link between spiritual transcendence  and a relinquishment of hope, fear, and the desire for certainty.  Introduction  From the dawn of recorded history, it seems, human beings have been  trying hard to “understand”. The two pre-eminent religious theorists of  the nineteenth century, E.B. Tylor and J.G. Frazer, went so far as to ascribe  the beginnings of religion itself to this drive (Segal 2004: 340). In their  view, people needed an explanation for what otherwise appeared random:  weather events, the behaviour of crops and animals, illness and injury, birth  and death.  Journal for the Study of Religion,Vol. 26, No. 1, 2013  </page> <page sequence="2"> 84 sacred  uncertainty  This raises the question: Why? Why was it necessary to understand how  and why these events and experiences arise? Why could people not, like  animals, simply adapt as necessary and continue about their business without  being compelled to investigate the laws governing their affairs? What is it in  the human psyche that reaches for the hope of resolution and recoils from  the fear of uncertainty? This article will contrast two thinkers’ analyses of  humanity’s quest for certainty, specifically with regard to religious beliefs.  Tibetan Buddhist teacher Chögyam Trungpa (1940-1987) was a prominent  interpreter of traditional Buddhist doctrine into the Western idiom. Born  in Tibet and rigorously trained in the traditional disciplines proper to his  status as the holder of two venerable Buddhist lineages,1 Trungpa Rinpoche2   fled to India following the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1959. He studied at  Oxford University before relocating to the United States in 1970. There, he  established both a Buddhist church and an organisation dedicated to secular  meditation training. The two streams have merged since Trungpa’s death in  1987, and currently operate as Shambhala International, a global network  of some 200 meditation centres and groups. In support of Trungpa’s view, I  also include commentary by one of his primary students, scholar of religion  Reginald Ray.  The second thinker I draw into my analysis is integrationist Ken Wilber.  Wilber has been called a philosopher, a psychologist, and a spiritual teacher.  A prolific author, he has written about the relationship between science and  religion since the 1970s. Wilber expresses an affinity with Buddhism — in  a reverent foreword to Traleg Kyabgon’s The  Practice  of  Lojong:  Cultivating   Compassion through Training the Mind, he all but declares himself a student  of this Tibetan Buddhist teacher (Wilber 2007: xi). Wilber is best known,  however, for numerous works detailing his four-quadrant model of human  evolution, which integrates intentional, behavioural, cultural, and social  lines of development.  Both this model and the Buddhist view of selfhood offer prototypes  of personal evolution; and both Trungpa and Wilber directly address the  predominance of hope, fear, and uncertainty in the quest for spiritual  understanding.  Science and Religion  Theistic religions offer believers an ultimate reference point in the notion  of a divine being who maintains a stable, permanent, changeless existence  beyond the vagaries of the phenomenal world. Even a vengeful, unpredictable  God may be preferable to the “chaos” of an unstructured worldview (Maslow  1971: 396). Sigmund Freud suggested that we invent malevolent supernatural  </page> <page sequence="3"> sacred  uncertainty 85  forces so that “we can feel at home in the uncanny and can deal by psychical  means with our senseless anxiety”. For “if death itself is not something  spontaneous but the violent act of an evil Will ... then we can breathe freely”,  because we can identify with the emotions and behaviours of the forces  responsible for our suffering (as quoted in Mandivenga 1980: 88).3  It could be argued that institutionalised religion has historically thrived  on the human quest for certainty. The Roman Catholic Church, for example,  reassures its followers that “Holy Mother Church holds and teaches that God,  the first cause (principium) and last end of all things, may be known with  certainty, by the natural light of the human reason, through the medium of  things created” (Vatican Council, Constitut. de Fide Cath., cap. Ii, as quoted  in Herbemann et al., 1917a).  The Bhagavad Gita, a central Hindu text, also promises escape from the  unpredictability of earthly existence: “He who sees that the Lord of all is ever  the same in all that is, immortal in the field of mortality,” the god Krishna  tells his devotee Arjuna, “he sees the truth.” The one who sees this truth,  furthermore, “is no more whirled around by fate” (Mascaró 1962: 101).  Nor is the quest for certainty confined to religious speculation. Scientists  continue to seek a so-called Theory of Everything — a theoretical framework  that, in reconciling Newtonian physics and quantum mechanics, will make  sense of the complete span of human understanding. In concluding his best- seller, A Brief History of Time, astrophysicist Stephen Hawking (1988: 175)  notes: “If we discover a complete theory ... it would be the ultimate triumph  of human reason — for then we should know the mind of God”.4  Unlike religion, science finds its certainties in manifest, reproducible  qualities and quantities. This is not to suggest that believers cannot be  scientists or vice versa; but at the level of paradigm, the two realms seem  at best to accomplish what Wilber (1998: xi) calls “a strange and grotesque  coexistence, with value-free science and value-laden religion deeply  distrustful of each other, aggressively attempting to colonize the same small  planet”.  Lest their perceived freedom from enslavement to religious values mislead  them, Daniel B. Botkin (2011) cautions scientists, as the title of his Wall Street  Journal article proclaims, that “Absolute Certainty Is Not Scientific”. Botkin  concludes with a light-hearted reminder from Nobel laureate and physicist  Richard Feynman: “If you think that science is certain — well that’s just  an error on your part.” Thus, in the matter of Holy Mother Church versus  Richard Feynman, we have the interesting contrast of religious certainty  versus scientific uncertainty.  Both Trungpa and Wilber have sought to harmonise religion and science.  Trungpa pioneered the presentation of esoteric Tibetan Buddhism in the  </page> <page sequence="4"> 86 sacred  uncertainty  language of Western psychology (Gimian 2005: xxvi). Wilber, for his part, has  devoted considerable intellectual exertion to achieving agreement between  the two paradigms. We need only consider the subtitle of his 1998 work, The  Marriage   of   Sense   and   Soul:  “Integrating  Science   and  Religion”.  Wilber (1998: 3)  opens this investigation with the assertion that “[t]here is arguably no more  important and pressing topic than the relation of science and religion in the  modern world”.  Trungpa located the foundational paradigm for individual human  development — what he calls “the birth of ego” (Trungpa 2005: 78-83) — in  the Buddhist abhidharma.5  According to this view, the “self” with which we  identify is in fact nothing more than a confluence of experiences, traditionally  known as the five skandhas, or aggregates: Form, Feeling, Impulse-Perception,  Intellect, and Consciousness.6  Wilber’s model incorporates a dizzying array of developmental theories,  ranging from the psychological (Piaget, Erikson, Maslow) through the  philosophical (Plotinus, Schopenhauer, Habermas) to the spiritual (Sri  Aurobindo, Ibn’ Arabi, St. Teresa), with side trips into sociology, anthropology,  gender analysis, and just about every other discipline relating to human  experience (Wilber 2000: 197-217). What makes Wilber an integrationist,  rather than an exclusively psychological or social theorist, is his insistence  that all development in any of his four quadrants is inseparably linked to  concomitant and simultaneous development in each of the other three  (Wilber 1995: 205).  The relevance of Wilber’s model for the purposes of this discussion is that  any movement in an individual’s relationship to hope, fear, and certainty  will necessarily manifest in both her inner and outer experience, as well  as in all her interactions with others. This helps clarify Wilber’s (2001: 175)  notion of the highest existential level (which he calls the centaur) where  “you are no longer egocentric or ethnocentric. You have moved deeply  into a worldcentric space.” Personal identification, in other words, is no  longer individual; it has incorporated all the elements of both individual and  collective worldviews in a non-dual awareness that admits of no separation  between subject and object, perceiver and perceived. Thus Wilber’s (2001:  207) developmental model moves from a primal identification with matter  to a level of consciousness unconstrained by the certainty that “I” exists  as a separate, autonomous entity. Such certainty, from this perspective, is  neither relevant nor desirable.  As can be seen, Trungpa uses the abhidharma to describe a delusional  process that culminates in an egocentric worldview. Wilber, by contrast,  takes the egocentric stance as his starting point, and tracks the way out of  it. Nonetheless, both thinkers consider the egoic worldview an existential  </page> <page sequence="5"> sacred  uncertainty 87  dead end.7  Central to both models is the notion of an imaginary, changeless  reference point — the belief in an enduring self or ego — against which we  measure our worth, plot our path, and plumb the meaning of existence  altogether. Using the abhidharma as his text, Trungpa tracks our compulsive  attempts to establish this reference point and, by implication, the path  back to a state of undeluded being. Wilber, starting from the opposite end,  elaborates a process of relinquishing the self-referential worldview.  The Quest for Certainty  The human craving for certainty has been well documented. The  Enlightenment philosopher Moses Mendelssohn (1983: 56), for example,  stated flatly that “civilized man ... wants to be able to count on something  certain”. The quest for certainty emerges as a consistent trope throughout  Robert E. Segal’s presentation of scholarship on the origins and functions of  myth from the nineteenth century to the present. “For [J.G.] Frazer,” Segal  (2006: 340) reports, “the knowledge that myth provides is a means to an end,  which is control over the physical world.” Claude Lévi-Strauss (as quoted  in Segal 2006: 351) believes that primitive peoples create myths “moved  by a need or desire to understand the world around them [and] proceed  by intellectual means, exactly as a philosopher, or even to some extent a  scientist, can and would do”.8  Maslow (1971: 395) and Días-Guerrero express  this drive to establish a definitive explanation of where we come from, why  we are here, and what to do about it as “the ordered demand for a conceptual  grip on the universe and its meaning for us”.  For Trungpa, the operative response to this demand is the question, who  wants  to  know?  Who is this “I” that is “moved by a need or desire to understand  the world”; who is issuing this “ordered demand”; and who constitutes the  “us” for whom meaning is such a compelling imperative? Trungpa (1978: 29)  suggests that merely posing these questions typically provokes “the fear of  not having a solid situation anymore. Solidified space is hope. It is hopeful in  that you manage to solidify the space as something to hang onto.”  Hope and fear are well established in this view — typically, as a paired set.  Trungpa (1992: 17) establishes the pair as inseparable from, if not actually  synonymous with, ego. “[E]go is that which is constantly involved with some  kind of paranoia, some kind of panic — in other words, hope and fear. That is  to say, as you operate there is a constant reference back to yourself ... then a  criterion of reference develops in terms of hope and fear: gaining something  or losing one’s identity.” In this model, the fear that a solid identity is lacking  is inseparable from the hope that it is not. This hope, in Trungpa’s view, is  powerful enough to project itself into the world as an illusory “solidified  </page> <page sequence="6"> 88 sacred  uncertainty  space”, or personal territory. “This establishment of territory in relation to a  central reference point seems to be the general pattern of the development  of ego”, he observes (1978: 29).  Wilber (2000: 240) is wary of the word ego, for it “is used in a thousand  different ways by different theorists, which makes it very difficult to  assign a definition”. His use of the term identity, however, approximates  Trungpa’s use of ego, in that it describes individual consciousness engaged  in a developmental process. In Wilber’s model, the evolving individual’s  “identity expands from ... egocentric to sociocentric to worldcentric” (ibid.).  This process leads, not to a loss of ego, but to what Wilber calls “a very  mature ego”, which is no longer identified with the narrow territory of its  own hopes, fears, and preferences. The worldcentric person “will still act in  his own self-interest where that is appropriate”, but “his own self-interest  will increasingly include the interests of others, since they fall into the orbit  of his own expanded identity” (2000: 36).  The Certainty of Self  According to the Buddhist abhidharma, our sense of ourselves as separate,  unitary, independent beings is mistaken. Ray (2000: 373) explains: “If we  examine our experience, we discover five different kinds of experiential  events (dharmas), but no solid, stable ‘I’ or ‘self.’” These experiential events  are encoded in the so-called aggregates (skandhas) mentioned above.  At the first skandha, the aggregate of Form, human beings attain their  initial apprehension of self and other. For Trungpa (1978: 1), the subject- object distinction is established at the outset, for “[f]undamental experience  begins with relativity, with the notion of comparison, which means ego and  its projections. You cannot experience anything without a somebody to  experience it and that is the starting point.”  Ray (2000: 373) describes the first skandha as referring to “those momentary  events that we experience as ‘physical’”. This description coincides with  the stages of self-realisation Wilber (2000: 104) calls “early fulcrums”, or  developmental pivot points. He summarises these as an “early mental self  [that] is at first a simple name self, then a rudimentary self-concept, but ... soon  expands into a full-fledged role self (or persona)” (ibid.; emphasis original).  Following child development theory, Wilber (2000: 102) posits a primal  mental stage prior to his “simple name self”, where “the self is still largely  undifferentiated from the material world”. It is not until the “full-fledged role  self” is established that we find the equivalent of the first skandha: a solid,  separate “I” that apprehends solid, separate “others”: a “newly internalized  superego”.  </page> <page sequence="7"> sacred  uncertainty 89  Both Trungpa and Wilber contest the material existence of an ego or  identity. For Wilber (2001: 207), in the fully evolved individual “the separate  self is nowhere to be found”. Trungpa (1992: 55) describes ego as nothing  more than a “basic makeup [that] consists of paranoia and confusion”. Or, as  Ray (2000: 231) puts it, “[e]go is basically a bad idea with no future”.  The belief in the existence of “a solid, separate ‘I’” is nonetheless  strongly entrenched, giving rise to the conventional dualistic worldview.  As the unchanging subject of perception, ego makes objects of all perceived  phenomena. “You cannot have criteria, notions of comparison, without ego”,  Trungpa argues. Therefore, “ego is the ultimate relative, the source of all the  relative concepts in the whole samsaric world” (2005: 96).9  This understanding has been reflected by mystics of various traditions.  T.M. McFadden (1979: 2447) notes that “the mystic is characterized by a  type of consciousness in which the subject-object polarity is not sharply  perceived”.10 From the perspective of this consciousness, the fundamental  reference point of self and other is at least blurred, if not entirely absent.  Yet this understanding is difficult to attain, according to Trungpa, who  submits that the ego — the belief in a separate self — works hard to maintain  the illusion of its own solidity. Nonetheless, “there is a tendency for the  coherency of that occasionally to break down. Therefore one needs to find  all sorts of means of confirmation, of confirming a coherent, consistent me,  a solid me” (1978: 50).  At the second skandha, Feeling, one “reach[es] out and feel[s] the qualities  of ‘other.’ By doing this, the ego-self reassures itself of its existence. ‘If I  can feel that out there, then I must be here’” (Trungpa 1973: 126). Wilber  describes this dynamic in terms of the self as locus of identity engaging in  “an annexing of various elements to create a self-sense” (2000: 226, n. 3).  Perception-Impulse, the third skandha, identifies and assigns desirability,  undesirability, or ignorance (literally, ignoring) to perceived phenomena.  Trungpa explains:  Form creates the ego ... and feeling brings the spiky quality  or sharpness within that, of something trying to maintain  itself. The perception comes as extending ego’s territory  and trying to define its position even much more. There  is in perception a lot of referring back to the central  headquarters of ego, and then extending and exploring  further and further always in relation back to it. (1978: 29)  Wilber’s description of the perceptual sequence somewhat approximates  Trungpa’s model, albeit as occurring in a different order:  </page> <page sequence="8"> 90 sacred  uncertainty  There is the sensation of the tree, which leads to perception,  and an image of the tree forms; affective factors color this  image (pleasant/unpleasant), and the person searches for  a series of words (symbols and concepts) with which to  label the tree; these concepts arise within the cognitive  space ..., and the preconscious high-speed memory scan  for appropriate words occurs within the given cultural  background (the language is English, say, and not  Italian), driven in part by a desire for intersubjective  communication and mutual understanding. All of this  summates in the person saying to me, “I see a tree.” (2000:  250, n. 36)  At the fourth skandha, Intellect, more sophisticated attitudes toward the  perceived other emerge. These span the spectrum from helpful or aspirational  (for example equanimity, discipline, and humbleness) to harmful or degraded  (aggression, dogmatism, greed, etcetera). These attitudes or orientations —  traditionally called samskaras, or mental formations — continue the project  of establishing certainty. Trungpa elaborates:  The general tendency of ego is uncertain at the beginning  how to establish its link with the world, its identity, its  individuality. As it gradually develops more certainty, it  finds new ways of evolving; it becomes more and more  brave and daring in stepping out and exploring new areas  of possible territory. (1978: 40)  Finally, Consciousness occurs as the fifth skandha. Trungpa (1978: 63)  describes consciousness in this context as “that sort of fundamental creepy  quality that runs behind the actual living thoughts, behind the samskaras”.  Functioning as such, “consciousness constitutes an immediately available  source of occupation for the momentum of the skandhas to feed on” (ibid.).  Wilber’s model of “integral psychology” echoes this construction in  asserting “broad states of consciousness, within which there exist various  structures of consciousness, within which there exist various states of  mind” (2000: 287).  It should be noted that the fifth skandha, Consciousness, is not the same  as the awareness prized by spiritual aspirants; nor can it be compared to  Wilber’s (2000: 1) elaborate psychological construction of mental functions,  structures, states, modes, and development. Like ego, consciousness is a term  requiring cautious and specific application. In the context of the fifth skandha,  </page> <page sequence="9"> sacred  uncertainty 91  it refers to a limited, self-referential form of cognition whose primary task is  to determine whether incoming perceptions are likely to confirm or threaten  the fundamental, isolationist position central to the Buddhist rendering of  ego (Trungpa 1973: 123).  From the abhidharma point of view, then, the craving for certainty springs  from an intuitive recognition that one’s most basic existential assumption,  one’s central ontological axiom, rests on shaky ground. Not only is the self  questionable; equally debatable is the existence of its objects of perception  and consciousness. Trungpa (1978: 7) notes: “Once we have dealt with the  projections of ego and seen their transitory and transparent nature, then ego  has no reference point, nothing to relate to.”  God and Death  The Buddha famously declined to pronounce on the existence or otherwise  of a supreme being. “Buddhism is nontheistic”, Ray (2000: 77) explains, “in  that it affirms that what is ultimately good and true does not reside outside,  in an external deity, but exists within, at our core.” The notion of God, from  this perspective, falls into the category of “projections of ego”.  Numerous religious texts depict God as an anthropomorphic super- being. In the Bhagavad Gita, for example, Krishna-Vishnu reveals himself to  Arjuna as possessing everything we humans have, only vastly more of it:  “numberless arms, bellies, faces and eyes” (Radhakrishnan 1948: 275). As  James L. Crenshaw (2001: 330) contends, “[w]e do fashion God in our own  image and look on this figure whom we have projected into the heavens as  the answer to human hunger for wholeness”.  God is more powerful than we; he11  is wiser than any mortal; his sensory  equipment is free of humanity’s spatial and temporal limitations. If God is  understood as a projection of ego, it seems reasonable to trace this projection  back to a human longing for omniscience and omniprescience. A particularly  crucial attribute of a God created to hold such projections — arguably,  the quality to which human beings most poignantly aspire — would be  permanence.  It has been said that death is the only certainty life has to offer (although  Benjamin Franklin added that taxes, too, are inevitable,12  while Marvin Gaye  appended a third certainty in the form of trouble.)13  Ironically, in the context  of the quest for certainty, most Western people, at least, reflexively reject  this one sure thing. To perform its function in allaying fears and fulfilling  hopes, a projected God would have to be deathless, permitting a humanity  fearful of death to steal back its projection in a preferred form. God is like us;  God is permanent; therefore we are deathless.  </page> <page sequence="10"> 92 sacred  uncertainty  It could be argued that this dynamic is evident in the many religious  doctrines that posit an enduring personal essence: a soul or atman that  survives death and continues its existence in an afterlife, typically by either  inhabiting a new body or taking up residence in some version of heaven, hell,  or purgatory. Such beliefs support the notion of ego’s permanence, and allow  believers to reject the certainty of their own death.  In confronting the necessity of death, human beings face what is  probably our most personally challenging uncertainty; for although death  itself is certain, what follows it is radically uncertain. The complete absence  of certainty regarding post-death experience — either its existence or its  putative nature — provides fertile ground for speculation. Here the physical  sciences desert us, for no mechanism has yet been devised that will enable us  to measure or qualify what follows death.  Ray (2000: 245) spells out our conundrum: “All people ... no matter how  powerful, famous, or wealthy they may now be ... will die, and none will be  able to take anything of what they are, what they own, or what they have  accomplished with them.” This is so unsettling to most people that “in  modern cultures, we are conditioned not to think about or even notice death  ... After we die, people will quickly forget about us, and in a short period  of time no one will even remember that we ever existed” (ibid.). Based on  Trungpa’s view, this state of affairs can be said to represent the ultimate  insult to ego.  By and large, religion is popularly expected to assure us of post-mortem  certainty. Thus, the online Catholic Encyclopedia submits that  “eternal life” is a term sometimes applied to the state and  life of grace, even before death; this being the initial stage  or seed, as it were, or [sic] the never-ending life of bliss in  heaven ... This, if we are true to ourselves and to God, is sure  to pass into the second stage, the life eternal. (Herbemann  et al., 1917b; emphasis added).  The question of belief in an afterlife aside, death is more than an exclusively  biological event. Psychologist Stanislav Grof (1998: 42-43) proposes that  suicidal tendencies “represent a fundamental confusion between suicide and  egocide”. In his view, the desire for death is actually a longing to transcend  an identity mired in an erroneous view of self and world.  In his model of the individual’s advance through progressive levels of  consciousness, Wilber concurs. The boundary between each level and the  next is marked by a “fulcrum”: “the momentous process of differentiation  and integration as it occurs in human growth and development” (2001: 131).  </page> <page sequence="11"> sacred  uncertainty 93  At each of Wilber’s fulcrums, the individual experiences a “death-terror or  death-seizure” reflecting the dis-identification with the lower level that is  necessary for identification with the higher (Wilber 1980: 110). What makes  this process terrifying, he contends, is our insistence on clinging to a separate  sense of self. “In order to transcend the death-terror,” Wilber submits, “one  must transcend the self. That is, there is nothing the separate self can do to  actually get rid of the death terror, since the separate self is that death-terror  — they come into existence together and they only disappear together”  (1980: 105; emphases original).  The Body  The body, as both originator and object of sensory perception, can always be  reliably invoked to challenge existential uncertainty. We speak of pinching  ourselves, for example, to ensure that we are not dreaming. A Buddhist  teacher counselled me during a distressing life passage to “come back to my  senses” — that is, to ground myself in the manifest reality of all that my  physical senses were registering in any given moment. As Trungpa (1978:  99) explains, “[i]f you ask a person, ‘How do you know that you are what  you are?’ the only simple way of explaining it is because, ‘I see myself in the  mirror. I am what I am. I have a body’”.  For Wilber this identification with the body is rooted in an infantile  level of consciousness14  he calls “the typhonic self”, or “body ego”, to which  he roughly attributes the lowest in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, “the  physiological and the safety” (1980: 21). Nonetheless, Wilber (2001: 148)  stresses the importance of being able to identify the boundaries of one’s own  body. “With psychosis”, he elaborates, “there is severe reality distortion,  marked especially by ... the incapacity to establish even the physical  boundaries of the self ... consciousness fails to seat in the physical body.”  Yet according to Trungpa (1978: 37), our experience of this physical body  is itself questionable. “We say ‘body’ and we say ‘mind,’” he proposes, “but  we have our own interpretation of them, our own concept of them, which  constantly separates us from the reality of the body and mind, the bodyness,  mindness, the thingness of things as they are”. The actual quality of “things  as they are”, Trungpa continues, “is what is called ‘emptiness’”. Ray explains  that this “emptiness” does not imply the meaninglessness of non-existence,  as it is frequently misconstrued. “The teachings on emptiness reveal that  it is our own ego-centered, self-serving versions of reality that are empty  of validity, not reality itself” (Ray 2000: 76). In the doctrine on emptiness,  therefore, ego is once again threatened with the eradication of its reference  points.  </page> <page sequence="12"> 94 sacred  uncertainty  Hope and Fear Hope and fear have long featured in the history of religion. The eighteenth- century philosopher David Hume (1976: 26; 31-33) identified the pair as a  “primary human experience” that is responsible for stimulating the religious  impulse. Spinoza cautioned that hope and fear “cause us to accept a kind of  secondary bondage, as hope for eternal reward (in heaven) and fear of eternal  punishment (in hell) lead us to submit ourselves to ecclesiastical authority  and engage in the superstitious rituals that constitute organized religion” (as  quoted in Nadler 2007: 30).  The Buddhist perspective agrees with Hume’s in designating hope and fear  as fundamental to human experience. The abhidharma describes the human  realm as one of six “realms of existence”,15 and the only one specifically  characterised by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Ray (2000:  270) explains that “hope and fear play a central role in the psychology of the  human realm: hope for further pleasure, possessions, and security, and fear  of losing what we have and of experiencing greater suffering”.  But Buddhism is far from alone in positing the hegemony of these  twinned experiences in human affairs. Moses Mendelssohn (1983: 62) noted  the dangers of employing them to motivate moral behaviour. Summarising  Spinoza’s views on the subject, Steven Nadler (2007: 30) notes, “Hope and  fear, in particular, direct our behavior as we strive after the things we desire  and flee those objects that we believe will bring us harm. These two passions  and the subsidiary affects that they ground constitute the greatest natural  obstacle to our freedom, well-being, and true happiness.” Accordingly,  Spinoza believed that abolishing the religious doctrine of the eternal soul  would liberate us from hope and fear. “Only if one believes that, after bodily  death, the soul survives in a robust and personal sense and that the self is  the subject of a postmortem divine reward and punishment is one likely to  be governed by hopes and fears over its eventual fate” (as quoted in Nadler  2007: 30).  For Spinoza, then, abandoning any pretence of certainty with respect  to our fate after death was central to our personal evolution as rational  beings. However, Spinoza was unable to resist transferring his own quest  for certainty to another object: for him, there were “eternal aspects of the  human mind” (Nadler 2007: 30). We can, therefore, avoid death through the  intellect, rather than through a putative soul. “When a person dies,” Nadler  explains, “all those aspects of the mind that are dependent on the body’s  durational existence — its sensations, memories, imaginations, and so on —  come to an end. The part of the mind constituted by the idea of the body’s  extended essence, however, persists eternally” (ibid.). Nadler is at pains to  point out that this everlasting life is impersonal. “Spinoza’s doctrine of the  </page> <page sequence="13"> sacred  uncertainty 95  eternity of the mind is not a doctrine of immortality”, he cautions. “There is  nothing personal about what remains of a person after death. It is not a self  ... It is simply a body of ideas and knowledge” (2007: 31).  Whatever Spinoza’s speculations regarding continuation after physical  death, they would have served to mitigate any anxiety regarding complete  annihilation. “The essence of the mind consists in knowledge”, Nadler cites  the philosopher as proclaiming (ibid.). Having devoted his life to philosophical  labour, Spinoza might have drawn some comfort from the notion that “the  human mind can be of such a nature that the part of it that we have shown  to perish with the body is of no account compared with that part of it that  survives” (ibid.).  This raises an interesting contrast between physical and conceptual  realities. On the physical plane, we are haunted by “the impermanence of  life and the ever-present possibility of death” (Ray 2000: 278). Concepts are  more enduring. The physical brain will inevitably deteriorate, making clear  thinking difficult or even impossible, but the idea itself can live eternally,  unchanging. For those in search of certainty, this makes concepts an  attractive alternative to experience.  Tibetan Buddhism offers the models of trangdön (literal meaning) and  ngedön (actual meaning) to distinguish between conceptual and visceral  understanding. Ray (2000: 363) explains: “Trangdön is like the idea of an ice- cream cone, while ngedön is the actual experience of eating that ice cream  cone” (emphases original). Obviously, the experience is over in minutes, but  one can mentally construct one’s ideal ice-cream cone and maintain it for a  lifetime. Loss of enjoyment in the actual experience is compensated by the  endurance of the fantasy.  Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that in Western culture the mind  (as synecdoche for concepts, ideas, and abstractions) routinely declares  its triumph over the body. The mantra “mind over matter” is invoked in  enterprises as disparate as dieting and surviving cancer. As Wilber (2000:  180) puts it, “[a]lmost every rational adult has a sense ... that the mind can,  on a good day, control the body and its desires”. Where little, if any, certainty  can be found in the impermanence of material reality, the life of the mind  flourishes independent of physical robustness (as in the case of the brilliant,  prolific, and paralysed Stephen Hawking); or even, if Spinoza is to be invoked,  independent of physical survival itself.  From a Buddhist perspective, the only certainty available to humanity  lies in our present and direct experience. Trungpa (1973: 84) explains: “The  philosophical or intellectual understanding of pain is not enough ... The  only way to get to the heart of the matter is to actually experience it for  yourself.” The nature of experience, however, is fleeting, incommunicable,  </page> <page sequence="14"> 96 sacred  uncertainty  and irreproducible. The certainty to be found here cannot be sustained or  confirmed by an external authority. Not even consciousness can be counted  on to provide a stable reference point. According to Trungpa (1992: 134-5),  “complete consciousness” is a dynamic “play or ... dance”. Ego’s “one-track- mind consciousness”, by contrast, reflects an impoverished attempt to  solidify that which is by nature evanescent.  Its emphasis on the primacy of experience notwithstanding, Buddhist  doctrine does reserve a place of honour for concepts. “Everything that we do,  however simple and nonconceptual it may seem, always implies some kind  of conceptual understanding”, Ray (2000: 230) points out. This includes the  study of Buddhism itself, for “the first step on the Buddhist path is hearing  and learning the teachings”, otherwise “we will simply fall back upon our  preconceptions and patterns of habitual thought” (2000: 232-233).  This conceptual initiative is only a first step, however; in order to  fully assimilate the content of Buddhist teachings, students must go on to  contemplate them (i.e., compare them to their own experience) and finally,  to meditate. At this third stage, “one looks directly at one’s mind, one’s  experience, to see how and what it really is, apart from expectations, fear,  and wishful thinking” (Ray 2000: 234). At this point, the student practises  to release familiar reference points, abandon hope and fear, and enter the  unknown territory of direct, unmediated experience. The culmination of this  practice is “insight ... into the emptiness or illusoriness of self and of our  habitual patterns” (Gimian 2005: xxvi) — what Trungpa calls egolessness.  Dying to the Self  It should be noted that neither Wilber nor Trungpa regards our reflexive  attachment to recognisable reference points as pathological or regressive;  rather, it is understood as a necessary stage in spiritual and psychological  growth. For Trungpa, “you begin with the dirty work, but that in itself becomes  a stepping stone”. He explains that beginning at the level of transcendence  makes the student reluctant to take the necessary plunge into the depths of  unattractive habitual patterns. Thus, “starting from the bottom, the whole  structure is fundamentally sound” (1978: 100).  Wilber (2001: 132) uses the metaphor of a ladder, on which the early  stages of the journey are, again, not only inevitable, but indispensable.16  “Just  as you must have words before you can have sentences, and you must have  sentences before you can have paragraphs, so these basic holons build upon  and incorporate their predecessors ... the higher rungs rest on the lower”  (2001: 129).  At each rung of Wilber’s ladder, the previous subject transforms into an  </page> <page sequence="15"> sacred  uncertainty 97  object. “The ‘I’ of one stage becomes a ‘me’ at the next” (Wilber 2000: 34; emphasis  original). Further, “you get a different type of self-identity” (Wilber 2001: 132;  emphasis original). Expanding one’s awareness by proceeding to the next  rung means that the climber “has to step off its present rung, or dis-identify  with it ... and then identify with the next-higher rung” (2001: 134; emphasis  original). “Essentially, this means that consciousness abandons its exclusive  identity with the lower structure — it ‘dies’ to it ... by accepting the death of the  lower-level, it transcends that level” (Wilber 1980: 110; emphases original).  Thus, Wilber’s evolutionary journey, in terms of both psychology and  spirituality,17 consists in a series of existential surrenders. Each such “death”  is painful, frightening, and reflexively resisted. As in Trungpa’s (1978: 50)  model, where “the basic notion of ego is ... trying to maintain oneself as ‘I  am’” , the loss of identification with an imagined, solid self is experienced as  a threat to survival itself.  Another way to describe the process of dis-identification with ego is as  a progressive relinquishing of certainties. From an abhidharma perspective,  the most fundamental certainty we wish to maintain is that of our unitary,  independent existence; but this certainty cannot be established because the  supposition on which it is based is fundamentally in error. In my reading  of both Trungpa and Wilber, it is precisely because the quest for certainty  is intrinsically doomed that no personal evolution is possible except to the  extent that such a quest is abandoned.  Wilber (2001: 142) likens the ultimate transcendence to free fall. “As Zen  would say,” he proposes, “you’re at the top of a hundred-foot pole, and yet  you must take one more step. How do you step off a hundred-foot pole? You  take that step, and where are you?” The answer is that  you are no longer “in here” looking at the world “out  there.” You are not looking at the Kosmos, you are the  Kosmos.18 The universe of One Taste19  announces itself,  bright and obvious, radiant and clear, with nothing outside,  nothing inside, an unending gesture of great perfection,  spontaneously accomplished. (ibid.)  And yet “it is all the most ordinary thing in the world, and so you think  nothing of it” (ibid.).  Perhaps this is because, as Trungpa (1978: 87) puts it, “the discovery  of wisdom has nothing to do with the centralized quality of ego. It is not  actually a discovery at all because you cannot see that you are discovering.  You become part of wisdom” (emphasis original). Trungpa adds a mystical  dimension to this realisation: “While drinking your cup of tea, you might  </page> <page sequence="16"> 98 sacred  uncertainty  discover that you are drinking tea in a vacuum ... So while doing any ordinary  thing, that reference point might bring an experience of non-reference  point” (2009: 74).  This raises the interesting possibility that the quest for certainty might  itself lead to the realisation of uncertainty. Be that as it may, both Trungpa’s  and Wilber’s versions of transcendence invoke a state of consciousness in  which certainty is no longer relevant. Both ultimately envision the possibility  of existence free of solid reference points, leaving nothing to hope for or to  fear.  Notes  1    Chögyam Trungpa was a lineage holder in the Kagyü and Nyingma schools of  Tibetan Buddhism.  2   Rinpoche (“precious jewel”) is an honorific title accorded to tulkus, or ostensibly  reincarnated teachers. Chögyam Trungpa is believed to have been the Eleventh  Trungpa Tulku. 3    Mandivenga is quoting Freud in The Future of an Illusion (1962: 11-12).  4    Interestingly, Hawking does not question the existence of a divine entity — at  least, not in this instance. He does, however, conflate the “triumph of human  reason” with Godhood, echoing the understanding of God as the perfection of  human faculties.  5   The abhidharma is one of the so-called “three baskets” of teachings attributed  to Gautama Buddha, circa 5th  century BCE. The abhidharma teachings detail the  Buddhist view of the development of ego. 6    These are Trungpa’s names for the five skandhas. Ray (2000: 373) translates the  third as simply “Perception” and the fourth as “Karmic formations”. 7    It should be noted that Wilber (2000: 226, n. 10) explicitly rejects the abhidharma’s  construction of selfhood.  8    Segal is quoting Lévi-Strauss from Myth and Meaning (1978: 16). 9   Samsara is translated literally as “cyclic existence” (Ray 2000: 18). It refers to the  phenomenal world as perceived by ego. 10 Curiously, McFadden goes on to contend that “strictly speaking, there are no  mystics among the Buddhists since they do not acknowledge an Absolute”. I  would argue that here McFadden has confused the pre- and trans-egoic stages of  consciousness, as in Wilber’s construction (1980: 50). 11 “He” it seems God must be, for until quite recently in human history, it has  been almost exclusively a male prerogative to pronounce on the nature of a  supreme being. The overwhelming preponderance of masculine forenames in the  historical literature of religious studies speaks for itself. In adding gender to the  qualities projected onto the divine being, this phenomenon could be understood  as supporting the contention that the God of the monotheistic and monistic  traditions is a projection of his worshippers. 12 Benjamin Franklin in a letter to Jean-Baptist Leroy, 1789, reprinted in The Works of  Dr.  Benjamin  Franklin  (1818). 13 Marvin Gaye, from the lyrics to “Trouble Man,” released by Tamla Records on 21  November 1972.  </page> <page sequence="17"> sacred  uncertainty 99  14 Wilber describes his evolutionary levels of consciousness, especially the early  ones, in the language of individual physiological, psychological, and cognitive  development. Nonetheless, he offers parallels for all of them in various spiritual  systems. The typhonic self, for example, is an analogue of the three lower chakras  (Yoga psychology), the malkuth and yesod (Kabbalah), and so forth. These parallels  suggest that the lower levels of consciousness are not confined to literal infancy,  but also reflect undeveloped capacities in people of all ages. Wilber (2001: 141)  reinforces this notion in his description of the consequences of dissociation at  any level of consciousness: “By the time the self reaches adulthood, it might have  lost 40 percent of its potential, as split-off or dissociated little selves ... [which]  tend to remain at the level of development that they had when they were split  off.”  15 Ray notes that “[w]hile affirming their objective reality, [Trungpa] tended to  present [the realms] to his students primarily as states of mind that human beings  can experience and that predominate in different kinds of people” (2000: 261). 16 Wilber is at pains to correct the misconception that his model is linear, however.  He describes his “ladder” as “one slice of that concentric pie” comprising “nested  spheres, with each higher level transcending and including its predecessor”. This  construction is central to Wilber’s “actualization holarchy, each stage of which  unfolds and then enfolds its predecessors in a nested fashion” (Wilber 2001: 128;  emphases original). 17 Wilber’s model may also be applied to social and cultural evolutionary trajectories,  exploration of which lies beyond the scope of this paper. 18 Wilber uses the Greek word for “whole” to describe an ultimate, all-inclusive  reality. 19 “One taste” is Wilber’s synonym for unitary consciousness. He describes the  experience of one taste as follows: “[T]he real world is given to you once,  immediately ... it is not severed into seer and seen, subject and object” (2001:  207; emphasis original).
