But it requires new forms in every era. Charles Wright has created a mysti- cism for the modem mind. Without assigning a super- natural cause, the poet identifies feelings-of melancholy, of ec- stasy, of the presence of the past, the transience of the present- with intuitions of the other side. This improvisatory sounding of the absolute is itself a condition of the modem, which is invested in no system of belief yet reifies the Void. His landscapes both ex- press and produce these effects. The invisible has become a hollow space in much contemporary poetry, but Wright renews its depth. Part of the strength of his metaphysical, even quasi-religious imagi- nation, unanchored by creed, comes from his careful attention to the visible world. The invisible is not a vague presence or ghostly absence, but a quality formed by our desire for absolutes, which in turn gives contour to the finite world we see and recall. Journal and landscape in Wright are not narcissistic registers of minor feel- ing and local color, but exhilarating phenomenological and aes- thetic encounters, in which the invisible is vigorously integrated with the seen, as in the positive and negative spaces of painting. With Negative Blue, Charles Wright has completed his trilogy of trilogies, the work of three decades. One can map his life's work, collected in Country Music (1982), The World of the Ten Thousand Things (1990), and Negative Blue (2000) onto several triads: Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso; Hell, Earth, Heaven; Past, Present, Future; Self, World, God. Yet the symbology of the tripartite structure is Contemporary Literature XLII, 2 0010-7484 / 01 / 0002-0325 ? 2001 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">326 - C O N T E M P O R A R Y L I T E R A T U R E more important than the particular symbolic subdivisions of the work. The ultimate unity of "something infinite behind every- thing" is Wright's only subject, endlessly renewed as his capacious mind confronts the landscape. As he wrote in The World of the Ten Thousand Things: I keep coming back to the visible. I keep coming back To what it leads me into, The hymn in the hymnal, The object, sequence and consequence. By being exactly what it is, It is that other, inviolate self we yearn for, Itself and more than itself, the word inside the word. It is the tree and what the tree stands in for, the blank, The far side of the last equation. (209) Wright reminds us of his persistence at the end of Negative Blue, though the terms have changed to emphasize structures over ob- jects: I've talked about one thing for thirty years, and said it time and again, Wind like big sticks in the trees- I mean the still, small point at the point where all things meet; I mean the form that moves the sun and the other stars. (201) There are, of course, observable stylistic shifts in the poet's career. The poems of Country Music display a gradual compression of lan- guage (and of the line) toward pure poetry. Like Pound, to whom he pays early homage, Wright works at the "synapse of word to word" (Country Music 83). He traces the "spider['s] crystal ascen- sion" (150) through radical synecdoche and disjunctive metaphor. But these poems are seeded by narrative and anecdote and ulti- mately recognize their attachment to the world. By mining his ori- gins, he seeks a transcendental identity, but since, in the words he quotes from T'u Lung, he cannot "travel in ether by becoming a void," he "borrow[s] a landscape" to convey his heart's yearning (157). The landscape is not a home ("strange were my travels") but</page><page sequence="3">C 0 S T E L L 0 * 327 a mediation of self and void. This has meant at first an emblematic style, but increasingly an immersion in surfaces for the hints of the infinite they yield. The landscape becomes richer and the line more expansive in The World of the Ten Thousand Things. Cezanne replaces Pound as the figure of homage, and painting, already evoked in Country Mu- sic, becomes a frequent language for imagining the landscape. The world is a canvas, the blue jay "up in a brushstroke / and over the hedge in one arc" (World 122). Such gestures foreground the intervention of the artistic consciousness in the apprehension of reality. Wright describes his work in terms suggestive of a land- scape painter: "My landscapes have always been imaginary, in- vented and reconstructed. I look and I impose and then I decom- pose them and then I recompose them" (Halflife 181). But as anecdotal and descriptive language increase, the passion for the metaphysical is no less in evidence here. These poems "jumpstart in verisimilitude and end up in ecstasy." Wright can evoke the feel of the infinite with remarkable power, "The unseen bulking in from the edges of all things, / Changing the frame with its nothingness"; "Those luminous fingerprints / left by the dark, their whorls / Locked in the stations of the pilgrim sun" (World 139). But he has learned from the mistakes of other mystics that ecstatic heights can leave the poet and his reader flailing in the wind. The variety of the visible world, approached with the fertility of metaphor, grounds and sustains Wright's meditations: the "Cardinal quick transfusion into the green arm of the afternoon" (122) or On the rocks, the white, triangular tears sailboats poke through the sea's spun sheet, Houses like wads of paper dropped in the moss clumps of the trees, Fog in its dress whites at ease along the horizon[.] (139) In "trying to get the description right," Wright's similes and per- sonification are among his keenest instruments of vision. Wright closes The World of the Ten Thousand Things with a coda of work called "Xionia" (published as a chapbook in 1990). Having exchanged symbolist density for descriptive and narrative expan- sion, he now turns to gnomic utterance. "Lust of the tongue, lust</page><page sequence="4">328 * C O N T E M P O R A R Y L I T E R A T U R E of the eye, / out of our own mouths we are sentenced," he writes in "Last Journal" (230). He will, the poems suggest, put his trust less in the visible, less in the utterable. In many ways, Negative Blue (with a few omissions, collecting the three last volumes, Chickamauga, Black Zodiac, and Appalachia, along with a coda called North American Bear) seems to fulfill this promise. Rather than offering a rich display of things in their meta- physical aspect, Wright is more interested here in structure and outline, pointing "beyond form," "beyond words." Instead of trac- ing the transient surface of the world, he focuses more on its blue canopy, often employing a rhetoric of prayer as a frame for descrip- tion. The impressionist Cezanne enters the company of more ab- stract painters: Giorgio Morandi, Mark Rothko, and Piet Mondrian. The latest trilogy recapitulates the figural structure of the three col- lections together, moving from the past and memory in Chicka- mauga to a concern with present structure, inscription, and constel- lation in Black Zodiac and approaching the mystic's silent anticipation of the wordless, formless God in Appalachia. Counting the empty spaces between the stars in North American Bear, Wright has gone about as far as he can go with landscape. But if we can find a progression in these volumes, it would nevertheless be a mistake to see Wright as a poet driven by narrative concerns or moving toward apotheosis. Essentially, he is writing the same poems he wrote in his youth, though their shape, like the man's, has changed from year to year. In Negative Blue we see not a last and distinctive phase so much as a culmination of practices and concerns that have oriented this poet throughout his career. Nega- tive Blue makes most explicit Wright's via negativa. For Charles Wright, the ultimate duty and fate of the poet is vi- sionary. But Wright's visionary poetry has some distinctly un-Ro- mantic, even anti-Romantic features, most notably a sharpening of the negative principle in representation over the principle of or- ganic holism. In his work, enumerations are subtractive, difference asserts itself before identity, reversals disrupt continuities. Wright's invisible is a matter of sides and edges, a negativity etched into what is visible, a depth created in a process of assertion and erasure. His hymns of the sensuous world are not tributes to the eternal in the real but an eschatological naturalism that locates vi-</page><page sequence="5">C 0 S T E L L 0 * 329 sion in intimations of the end. The absolute consumes and absorbs rather than radiates; its agent is death, "the black moth the light bums up in." Wright's symbolist poetry has the edge of allegory without a key; it knows it does not participate in what it desires. His metaphoric technique creates an antimimetic estrangement within the descriptive surface. Setting meditation within a contem- porary landscape, applying the ancient practice of the via negativa to a modern skepticism about language and myth, and associating vision with the techniques of modern abstract painting, Wright has created a visionary poetics for our time. Critics have written about Wright's combination of transcenden- talism and skepticism, his metaphysics of absence. Edward Hirsch identifies "a bright, ahistorical, diamondlike kernel of Neo-Plato- nism at the core of his writing" (248). But Bruce Bond points to an element of skepticism and longing. He quotes Wright's remark in Halflife: "I would love to believe the world is Platonic, but I think it's Aristotelean" (264). Richard Tillinghast finds "a philosophical position closely akin to Buddhism" (196), while for Calvin Bedient, Wright is the "St. Ignatius of dark puddles" (47). Indeed, it is im- possible to piece together any coherent theology from Wright's combination of medieval Christianity, southern Episcopalianism, Zen Buddhism, and modern phenomenology. One feels that Wright's supernatural is something arising from childhood reli- gious training, adopted Italian culture, Chinese literature, and twentieth-century literature and painting. Wright's poetry is not theological or even confidently transcendental. The Christian nega- tive way merges with modernist skepticism and negation. There are few apostrophes in his work; he does not write to transport himself to the godhead or the All. Rather, he aims to see the world of the ten thousand things in a symbolic aspect by shading it with absence. Here effects and affect are more important than first causes. His subjects, Wright tells us in poems and interviews, are "language, landscape, and the idea of God" (Quarter Notes 123). They form, of course, one trinitarian subject. Language, especially metaphoric language, introduces the negative principle into land- scape because it creates a difference from the seen world, which allows us to view it in a symbolic aspect, and it is in this difference that "the idea of God" takes shape. But Wright's poetry pleases</page><page sequence="6">330 * C O N T E M P O R A R Y L I T E R A T U R E not as revelation, not in its power to imagine God through land- scape, but in its use of the negative principle in language to shape and contour landscape with the idea of the absolute. By means of the "meta-optics" (Negative Blue 106) and metalinguistics of desire, he gives nature another side. This turn toward the world can of course be identified in the Romantic project as well, which Coleridge described in Biographia Literaria as aimed at "spreading the tone, the atmosphere, and with it the depth and height of the ideal world around forms, incidents, and situations of which for the common view, custom had be- dimmed the lustre and dried up all the sparkle of dew drops" (85). But Wright's ideal world is formal and mathematical rather than organic, and it remains on the "other side." The relational world is vital and linguistic; the absolute is inorganic and apophatic. Desire, then, is doomed and tragic. As such, it does not produce an atmo- sphere of luster and sparkle but one of darkness and shadow mark- ing the edges of things, provoking rapturous melancholia rather than joy, a feeling of weight rather than elevation, a sense of com- pulsion rather than orphic power. But if failure haunts Wright's meditations, if metaphysics is experienced as a lack, the negative principle becomes a positive aesthetic and affective aspect of land- scape. The positing of an unknowable other side contours and gives depth and shading to the perceptual world and stress to the poet's voice in the articulation of desire and limit. In reading nature as the outline of the infinite, Wright may seem to enter the Puritan typological tradition. But his outline is a nega- tive text; the infinite creates a dark outline around all natural and manmade things. We see "[c]olumns eaten by darkness," notice that "something . .. settles itself like black light / invisibly in our hair" (Negative Blue 11). The landscapes are tropological rather than typological; they are manhandled and language-drenched. The sense of wonder comes less from an ecstatic participation in an antivital ideal than from the mood of separation from that ideal. He calls "sin" "our lack of transparency" (133) and identifies it with being. Its difference from the absolute (from Nothingness) gives being its edge. Exploring this condition of ontological sin, rather than transcendental power, is often Wright's aim and the drive behind his metaphors and similes.</page><page sequence="7">C 0 S T E L L 0 * 331 Charles Altieri complained many years ago, in Self and Sensibility in Contemporary American Poetry, about the elegiac character of Wright's verse, saying he preferred the poetics of plenitude and self-evacuation in Gary Snyder's work, which is stripped of meta- phor. Wright's recent poetry would certainly not satisfy him either. In defense of Wright, the poet's desire for "the other side" is di- rected to a new apprehension of this side heightened by "what's- not-there" (Negative Blue 11): "Electrical surge and quick lick of the minus sign" (102). Romanticism's elegiac mood, its sense of lost luminosity, can lead to etiolated images. But Wright's abstraction by subtraction "bums in" to the perceptual world (he uses this burning and charring metaphor often, along with cognates like the burring tool of the engraver), leaving a depth and impression, a vivid darkness. The self too takes shape in the desire for what-it- is-not. These ideas of sin and limit particularly distinguish Wright's vi- sionary poetics from the Romantic and Emersonian traditions that have continued to dominate American landscape poetry in the twentieth century. Themes of sin and limit, the longing for grace, and the need for works place Wright in a different poetic line, more akin to Edward Taylor and Emily Dickinson. As Elisa New has pointed out in The Regenerate Lyric, her book about the legacy of American Puritan poetry, a preoccupation with ends rather than indeterminacy, of the poet's and nature's difference from the ideal, leads to a poetry of work rather than of vatic power. Unprovable theorems, long-abandoned arguments- You've got to write it all down Landscape or waterscape, light-length on evergreen, dark sidebar Of evening, you've got to write it down. (Negative Blue 125) But "One only writes in order to erase again" (Black Zodiac 41). Wright is not a poet of revelation, then, but of description, a work that confidently affirms, "the subject was never smoke, / there was always a fire," but that chooses to look more at the ash than the flame. "Where there's smoke, there's ash" (195); "I remember the word and forget the word / although the word / Hovers in flame around me" (17).</page><page sequence="8">332 ? C O N T E M P O R A R Y L I T E R A T U R E But Wright gives the emblematic tradition a modern, intensely tropological but antitypological turn. Landscape is an unreadable, undecodable text. Henry Vaughan's "deep but dazzling darkness" becomes "the dark undazzle," the night sky "a code card punched with holes" keyed not to the Great Code but to "the Great Misun- derstanding." He observes the "slip-stitch vocabulary of winter trees" and concludes, "the country we live in's illegible, impossible of access" (Negative Blue 199). "A loneliness west of solitude / Splinters into the landscape / uncomforting as Braille" (17). So conversely, "[t]he poem is a code with no message" (33), unkeyed to revelation. Wright's obsessive treatment of landscape as text ("dark page of the sky" [176]; "landscape laid open like an old newspaper" [168]) and more recently as computer screen ("turkey buzzard logs on to the late evening sky" [163]) draws from the old conflation of landscape and scripture, but it evades the fixing of the scripture to a legible, transcendental meaning. Indeed, one senses that the poet's scripting of the landscape precedes any read- ing of it, that nature as text is an effect of the poet's authorship. More than any previous volume, Negative Blue gives us landscapes seen in the aftermath of textual experience: "After Reading Wang Wei, I Go Outside to the Full Moon," "Reading Rorty and Paul Celan One Morning in Early June," "Blaise Pascal Lip-syncs the Void," "After Reading T'ao Ch'ing, I Wander Untethered Through the Short Grass," and so on. Wright is imitating an ancient Chinese model, adopted by modern poets, but it has special significance here, where the textualizing of the landscape introduces the nega- tive principle that "untethers" the material world. Mutlu Konuk Biasing made some very brief but perceptive re- marks, in her review of The World of the Ten Thousand Things, about the scriptural nature of Wright's landscapes. "His transcendental dimension ... is a function of his technique," she notes, and she describes this technique as "the identification of text and world, of word and thing, [which] allows him to create the illusion of a 'signified' spiritual depth by remaining anchored in the scriptural surface" (200). Blasing's insights about Wright resonate with Ken- neth Burke's important comparison of logology and theology in The Rhetoric of Religion. Burke has suggested the role played by the negative principle in language and in theology in producing this</page><page sequence="9">C 0 S T E L L 0 * 333 effect of spiritual depth. Indeed, theology draws from logology (the Word from words) in this regard. Without concerning himself with the truth or falsehood of visionary claims, he traces them to the central role played by negation in the system of language. From a "first analogy" between words and the Word, and a "second anal- ogy" in which "words are to the non-verbal things they name as Spirit is to Matter," Burke derives a "third analogy" concerning the negative: "quite as language involves a principle of negativity in its very essence [a word is not the thing it names], so theology comes to an ultimate in 'negative theology,' since God, by being 'supernatu- ral,' . . . can be called the 'truly' positive, and the positives of the empirical realm can be called negative" (22). Negation perpetuates the ultimate dialectic between Being and Nothingness. In "Basic Dialogue" (Negative Blue 147) (a dialogue between matter and spirit, perhaps), Wright uses the negative principle to invert the order of actuality. Since the world is scriptural (unreal, artificial), then lan- guage, description in particular, realizes the "tactile," the "precise": The transformation of objects in space, or objects in time, To objects outside either, but tactile, still precise . It's always the same problem- Nothing's more abstract, more unreal, than what we actually see. Yet the logic is nested in a series of negations: Two dead crepe-myrtle bushes, tulips petal-splayed and swan-stemmed, All blossoms gone from the blossoming trees-the new loss Is not like old loss, Winter-kill, a jubilant revelation, an artificial thing Linked and lifted by pure description into the other world. Description conscripts the world into a holy war against material- ity and the self's embodiment: Syllables scatter across the new grass, in search of their words. Such minor Armageddons. Beside the waters of disremembering, I lay me down.</page><page sequence="10">334 ? C O N T E M P O R A R Y L I T E R A T U R E Burke has further shown that language has a circular force be- tween profane and sacred. This notion is particularly helpful in understanding the appeal of Wright's visionary work for a modern, skeptical age. The words for a godhead linger long after belief in a godhead retreats-in fact, the structure of language and thought may inevitably produce absolutes, as the drive for totality leads us to titles. There is no God, and Wright is his prophet. Burke writes: Whether or not there is a realm of the "supernatural," there are words for it. And in this state of linguistic affairs there is a paradox. For whereas the words for the "supernatural" realm are necessarily borrowed from the realm of our everyday experiences, out of which our familiarity with language arises, once a terminology has been developed for special theo- logical purposes the order can become reversed. We can borrow back the terms from the borrower, again secularizing to varying degrees the origi- nal secular terms that had been given "supernatural" connotations. (7) This idea helps to explain the persistently theological aura about modern, secular nature writing. Andrew Marvell's drop of dew finds no Almighty Sun in Wright but remains suspended on a verti- cal axis of reciprocity where metonymy never quite yields to meta- phor: "The whole moon and the whole sky are reflected / in a dewdrop in the grass. / The depth of the drop is the height of the moon" (World 225). We have a language of the transcendental without a narrative of transcendence. In this circular effect, as in other ways, we see that the negative principle can have content. Double negatives, of course, produce positives, in math and in language-hence Wright's many varia- tions on absence within an absence: the inside of the inside, meta- phor of metaphor. And negative space in painting (black in chiar- oscuro, or light areas behind foregrounded outlines, the sculpted space of Chinese painting), like white space in writing, is a force in the composition: "The sky with its undercoat of blackwash and point stars" (4). Many religions practice an emptying out, a way of rejection (as described by Denis the Areopagite or Boethius, fa- vorite Wright mystics) as a method of meditating God. "[E]mpti- ness ... fills us" (14), Wright insists, but he does not practice the mystic's minimalism. He keeps the Aquinian straw burning. The</page><page sequence="11">C 0 S T E L L 0 * 335 most obvious instance of the negative principle can be seen in the conversion of prefixes to nominal negatives or God terms-the Un- seen, the Ineffable, the Unknown. The prefixes do not erase but add to the syllable count. Alone this positive identity would be weak-merely a verbal placeholder. The nominal negative is an announcement of failure. But the terms function to posit a transcen- dental signifier that sets in motion other gestures in the descriptive surface, where that signifier becomes improvisatory, localized, in- tense. "Something is added as the birds disappear," Wright an- nounces, as if carrying forward the argument of the woman in Wallace Stevens's "Sunday Morning." Where a Romantic poet ap- prehends the landscape as a totality expressive of the eternal whole, where time is absorbed into spatial infinite, Wright's abso- lute is felt in inverse proportion to divestiture, which can never be complete in consciousness. Fugitive moments in nature, bends in the road, and various other disappearances and mutabilities ex- pose sacramental markers. The abstract is renewed by the lusting eye. Many of these poems begin with a scene setting, locating the self in a specific time and place. But the description vacillates between appearance and disappearance. Typically, metaphor and simile lift the landscape out of its materiality. Afternoon overcast the color of water smoothed by clouds That whiten where they enter the near end of the sky. First day of my fifty-fifth year, Last week of August limp as a frayed rope in the trees, Yesterday's noise a yellow dust in my shirt pocket Beneath the toothpick, the .22 bullet and Amitone. Sounds drift through the haze, The shadowless orchard, peach leaves dull in the tall grass, No wind, no bird shudder. Green boat on the red Rivanna. Rabbit suddenly in place By the plum tree, then gone in three bounds. Downshift of truck gears. (16)</page><page sequence="12">336 * C O N T E M P O R A R Y L I T E R A T U R E Wright uses a variety of devices here to evoke the sense of presence and erasure: the nondescriptive "color of water" suggests fluency as well as transparency, the "near end of the sky" a horizon, both close ("near") and far ("end"). The "frayed rope" metaphor may evoke a feeling of being at the end of one's rope but also suggests something once tied and taut. The synesthesia (noise becoming dust) is another Wright technique for fusing the visible and the invisible. Shifts of scale give focus to the drift, the toothpick and .22 and Amitone all locating perception in connection with the poet's mortal body. The "no" before "wind" and "bird shudder" define absence of movement, balanced by the vibrant "Green" and "red" of boat and river, both signs of movement. Rabbit ("gone") and truck gears ("Downshift"), nature and industry, mark further de- partures and arrivals in this rhythm of image and erasure. Wright's poetry has expanded into journal and description, time and space, in part so that there is more to absorb the pressure of the negative, more to cut back. As in Stevens, an allusive presence throughout Wright's later work, the poems use the seasons as figures for cre- ative cycles. "Local Journal," at the end of The World of the Ten Thousand Things, exemplifies this direction: At three in the afternoon, My right [hand] with the pruning shears Cutting the sticks of the rhododendron back. Later, Trailing the garbage cans to the curb, Solace of river rock, raw rood of the power pole. (228) For a poet who sees lack of transparency as our sin, Wright car- ries a heavy burden of description; but if metaphor is deferral, me- diation upon mediation, metaphor inside a metaphor, like absence in an absence, might, through the negative principle, intimate the unknown. Thus are his descriptions impacted with metaphors (as in the power pole as rood) to alienate vision from seeing and let the darkness in. He rearranges and redescribes, disrupting tempo- ral flow. Wright does not simply follow the image out into its van- ishing; he creates a gap, initiates a "narrative of metaphor" discon- tinuous with the "narrative of image" (Quarter Note 66) but pointing to no final revelation.</page><page sequence="13">C 0 S T E L L 0 * 337 The very title of Wright's 1997 volume should cue us to his use of the negative principle, for Black Zodiac is a negative zodiac, like the negative of a photograph. Writing is that black on white code to the infinite. In the practice of the via negativa, of course, poetry is the negative of writing: "Poetry's what's left between the lines- / It's all in the unwritten, it's all in the unsaid" (Negative Blue 94). We come full circle, then, and the cause (the Unsaid, the supernatural) is identified with the effect (the unsaid, poetry) that arises out of written lines. Tautology and circular thinking are forms of circulation in poetry, of course, and this by no means merely reduces the idea of the supernatural to the idea of poetry. But it does bracket the question of the supernatural. A poet who declares the visionary his "duty and fate" yet dra- matizes repeatedly his failure of vision must sooner or later write his "Apologia Pro Vita Sua." Failure must be transformed from a dead end to an edge that regenerates-and this is what the first poem of Black Zodiac does. Country Music looked at origins to ex- plain a life. In Negative Blue, Wright starts at the end of the line: How soon we come to road's end- Failure, our two-dimensional side-kick, flat dream-light, Won't jump-start or bur us in, Dogwood insidious in its constellations of part-charred cross points, Spring's via Dolorosa flashed out in a dread profusion, Nowhere to go but up, nowhere to turn, dead world-weight, They've gone and done it again, dogwood, Spring's sap-crippled, arthritic, winter-weathered, myth limb, Whose roots are my mother's hair. (71) By itself the end is shallow, a merely linear terminus. Failure is a "flat dream-light." But the negative principle enters (as a counter- pressure, not just the entropy of the positive effort), to give further dimension to the experience of failure. Failure becomes sacrifice with the sacramental image of the dogwood and its "part-charred cross" (something has, indeed, burned in), so that the axis shifts from the horizontal road to the Passion: at the end of the line there is "Nowhere to go but up," a direction reinforced by the constella-</page><page sequence="14">338 - C O N T E M P O R A R Y L I T E R A T U R E tion metaphor. The whole opening passage has a weariness remi- niscent of T. S. Eliot's "Gerontion" and "The Burial of the Dead," but the poem responds to the ache of generational cycles with a renewed muscularity of metaphor that builds in a third dimension (since we start with a two-dimensional world, the third stands in for the fourth in Wright's iconology). As the apologia continues in the next passage, Wright justifies his emphasis on landscape: Landscape's a lever of transcendence- jack-wedge it here, Or here, and step back, Heave, and a light, a little light, will nimbus your going forth[.] But doesn't it in fact work the other way, even in his description? As he goes on, the landscape is not the lever but what is being jacked up. The lever is language-which alienates landscape from nature so that it, in turn, can elevate us (again the process is circu- lar). This poetic "jack-wedging" relies largely on the appeal of the negative principle, which includes metaphor since (especially in Wright) it makes the landscape what it is not (in this instance a suffering human body, "sap-crippled, arthritic," then a door to the infinite by way of redemption). The jack-wedging, like the burning- in, is made possible by the initial sense of the "terminal" character of all natural images: "The dew bead, terminal bead, opens out / onto a great radiance." Here again Marvell is suggested, without the clear metaphysical script of Protestant poetics but with the strict sense of the limits of the natural world. The Romantic avoids the terminus. It is precisely those most terminal elements of nature that Wright pursues and sets against an iconography of the infinite. The poem relies on the principle of brokenness and negation, exer- cises in the desire for wholeness that create an idea of wholeness and name it, self-defeatingly, as that which is beyond all effort. In the next passage, which outlines a meditative practice, the poet promises a luminous landscape that will "nimbus your going forth." We might expect a transcendental moment. But instead of pursuing this route, he returns to the negative principle and reflects on "[d]iscredited form, discredited subject matter" of "[j]ournal and landscape" (72). The negative principle in the dis- carries over to the Dantean chiasmus "Verona mife', disfecemi Verona," and we begin to see a structure of making and unmaking as intimating a</page><page sequence="15">C 0 S T E L L 0 * 339 whole, an "all that" which is directionless. "Beyond" itself be- comes a mode of negation (something like un-), rather than a deictic to the absolute. "There is an order beyond form, /but not there. Not here, either" (194). The Romantic's ecstatic moment "already with thee" can't be found in Wright, any more than the objectivist's plenitude. It is, then, through this negative principle that Wright can say "Failure reseeds the old ground" (4). It accomplishes the reassertion of that line that burns in the infinite. Darkness, paradox- ically, becomes "the IV from the infinite" (72) and the bleeding of this life meets a dark transfusion from the next that lends poetic vitality to the seen. In fact, the whole landscape becomes an en- largement of the poet's mortal body. He writes of the "arterial" sky (145), the fall's "early chemotherapy" (53); the stars "take off their bandages and stare" (148). Yet Wright's emphasis on nature as a suffering body works into a model of correspondence which is fundamentally abstract and formal. A depersonalizing of "the other side" accompanies the anthropomorphism of landscape. If the poet's work is a moving of the inchworm from here to there in metaphoric deferrals (Negative Blue 67), the cancellations and displacements nevertheless carve out a negative space of inti- mation. In the meantime, language also affords misery company- visionary company over time-space limits. The poet's failure joins those recorded by predecessors. Wright is an unapologetic solitary, yet there is a community formed among the pilgrims of the via negativa. This is not a social community that would make the poems dialogical. Rather, it is a community of ghosts whose presence un- fastens the world from its material surface. In a section of Chickamauga called "Aftermath," Wright includes a number of poems that explore the relation of language to land- scape and the idea of God by way of reading and looking. "Looking Outside the Cabin Window, I Remember a Line by Li Po" is partic- ularly interesting for its implicit use of the negative principle. The poem begins: The river winds through the wilderness, Li Po said of another place and another time. It does so here as well, sliding its cargo of dragon scales To gutter under the snuff of marsh willow and tamarack.</page><page sequence="16">340 ? C O N T E M P O R A R Y L I T E R A T U R E The poem is self-consuming as it winds between metonymy and metaphor, pursuing a visionary goal but falling back into the limits of representation. This is what keeps the poem moving, like the river it describes, which is also a fire, consumed as it goes, leaving a scorched trail. But the burning field does not burn out. Mid-moring, Montana high country, Jack snipe poised on the scarred fence post, Pond water stilled and smoothed out, Swallows dog-fighting under the fast-moving storm clouds. Expectantly empty, green as a pocket, the meadow waits For the wind to rise and fill it, first with a dark hand Then with the rain's loose silver A second time and a third as the day doles out its hours. Sunlight reloads and ricochets off the window glass. Behind the cloud scuts, inside the blue aorta of the sky, The River of Heaven flows With the barge of stars, waiting for darkness and a place to shine. We who would see beyond seeing see only language, that burning field. In the movement of this poem, language helps us see beyond land- scape by the distance between words and things, but language is not a transparency, only another landscape, a burning field in which the visionary aspect is kept awake in the negative principle. The words of Li Po, "The river winds through the wilderness," seem matter-of-fact and local, or recall only the history of Li Po, who drowned trying to embrace the moon's reflection in the water. But their evocation before Wright's window-framed natural landscape produces a mnemonic and metaphoric relation to what is seen. The river becomes at once Chinese dragon and dragon's fire, burning its way through the wilderness of the Unsaid and consumed as it goes. In this sense it is the same river of Li Po's words, and time is transformed through metaphor. The dragon metaphor is itself extinguished, drawn back into the descriptive surface of "marsh</page><page sequence="17">C 0 S T E L L 0 * 341 willow and tamarack" where the flame of metaphor will "gutter under the snuff." The metaphoric flame bums into the landscape but is also snuffed by it. The next stanza is typical Wright diary notation, but having shifted down to the metonymic, he has framed an image of natural flux and reflective poise (fast-moving clouds, dogfighting swallows, poised jacksnipe, still pond) that mirrors the condition of his consciousness. The third stanza draws us back to the metaphoric level with the lovely personification of the mead- ow's green pocket, the night's dark hand, and the rain's loose change, a narrative of the day doling out its hours. The monetary trope perhaps echoes the "currency" of the river, the endless meta- phoric exchange going on in the poem as the landscape is filled and emptied by comparisons and the "invisible hand" (not Adam Smith's but a divine analogue) is left unseen. While the river does not appear literally in this poem, it is present not only through the utterance of Li Po's words but implicitly in the temporal movement of the scene and in the flair of metaphor. The entrance of the sun- light heats up the poem, again overwhelming the lovely liquid drift with a lethal force to undo the personifications of the previous stanza. The sunlight "reloads and ricochets," aiming at the I/eye of the poet. But in the circulation of the spiritual rhetoric, it kills the personified landscape, the subject's projection, by entering the "blue aorta of the sky." There will be no eye of heaven winking back at the acolyte. The poem disallows, then, the Romantic ideal- ization of the sky or nature as personified type of the absolute. As day dies and darkness approaches, erasing the poet's metaphors, the heavenly barge becomes a funeral proceeding down this end- less river of time and trope. Revelation remains anticipatory, as the zodiacal stars are "waiting for darkness and a place to shine," to figure the visionary thrust of the via negativa. The negative principle, then, establishes a system of difference and reciprocity in the poem that intimates the absolute. The invisi- ble meat of the sacramental imagination is accessible to and through visible things only by a process of decomposition, empty- ing out into the shapeless where it is reborn as the shape of dark- ness. The negative principle becomes the principle of opposition and the other side a world of antimatter. Again, the apophatic de- pends upon the propositional. The poet stations himself as beholder</page><page sequence="18">342 . C O N T E M P O R A R Y L I T E R A T U R E at the breach of this difference, but even this position is defined in a negative, "unwavering point / under that [the seen] world's waves." The negative principle at work in the difference of mor- phemes charts the ineffable. Yeats is the guide here: "who can dis- tinguish darkness from the dark," "when whole is part of the part and part is all of it?" The negative principle establishes a boundary (figured in landscape as a horizon line), a "line between abysses," a difference without a difference that defines the power of music as a tightrope walk, black notes against white notes, and the visual interval of a Rothko painting. This linguistic play of the negative principle reaches a particular pitch in Black Zodiac, not only in the verb/noun substitution "we believe in belief but don't believe" (Negative Blue 105), but in the heavy use of chiasmus, that syntactic reversal that weaves and unweaves like Penelope: "forms are shaped and shapes formed"; "all stars are lights, all lights are not stars"; and other antitheses such as Augustine's "Do not despair- one of the thieves was saved; do not presume- / one of the thieves was damned" (102), which Beckett turned to black comedy. Wright is somewhere between Augustine and Beckett in his exercise of the negative principle and related forms of cancellation. Something happens in the process of articulation and erasure so that we are not merely where we started but have built in a space: "The pencil spills everything, and then takes everything back" (103). We are still waiting for Godot, but our repetitions and failures have taken shape around a darkness. Even anagrammatic reversals can hint of the infinite, as the dogs that prowl Wright's heaven become, in their inhumanity, not friends to man but instruments of God. Visual analogues of the negative principle appear throughout the poems: in seasonal metaphors (which Wright presents as com- pulsory repetitions of growth and divestiture, rather than signs of renewal and eternal continuity), diurnal erasures, the gatherings and evaporations of clouds, the moon as an "albino black hole" (Negative Blue 90). If landscape is most often textual, it is still a visual surface, with chiaroscuro effects, a photographic negative, back- wash of last light, dissolving lines of material forms. ("Morandi's late line is always on the point of disappearing, of not seeming to be there" [Halflife 8].) In the apophatic tradition, painting is poetry's familiar other-its silence gives of the other side. In The World of</page><page sequence="19">C 0 S T E L L 0 ? 343 the Ten Thousand Things, the negative principle was identified in the painterly aspects of Cezanne's canvases, how his brush looses the image from illusion, to bring the past into the painterly present. This painterly presence of the past Wright identifies with "the dead": The dead are a cadmium blue. We spread them with palette knives in broad blocks and planes. We layer them stroke by stroke In steps and ascending mass, in verticals raised from the earth. (World 6) But Cezanne's realization has been displaced in Negative Blue with Mondrian's reductions. The world as canvas, so pervasive in Wright's treatment of landscape, his directionals, his identification of movement with brushstroke, becomes in this collection a matter of erasures, revealing outlines. "Back Yard Boogie Woogie" (Nega- tive Blue 172) begins with Cezanne, but Mondrian determines the vision: "I look out at the back yard- / sur le motif, as Paul Cezanne would say." But the momentum is toward something purer than Cezanne, something entirely impersonal, to match "February sun- light indifferent as water to all the objects in it. / / Only perfection is sufficient, Simone Weil says," and Mondrian implies. "Sitting at dusk in the back yard after the Mondrian retrospective," the poet understands the link between the "slow destruction of form" which is the diurnal cycle and the apprehension of order: Mondrian thought the destructive element in art Much too neglected. Landscape, of course, pursues it savagely. It's August. The countryside Gathers itself for sacrifice, its slow fadeout along the invisible, Leaving the land its architecture of withdrawal, Black lines and white spaces, an emptiness primed with reds and blues. (122-23) Underlying these and other linguistic and visual effects of the negative principle is an interest in form and structure and even the</page><page sequence="20">344 C O N T E M P O R A R Y L I T E R A T U R E world-otherworld relation as algebraic. The parabolic character of the world of the ten thousand things involves a mathematical bal- ance rather than an organic extension. Here the negative principle operates by inversion and transferal. The opening lines of Negative Blue announce this direction: Three years ago, in the afternoons, I used to sit back here and try To answer the simple arithmetic of my life, But never could figure it- This object and that object Never contained the landscape nor all of its implications, This tree and that shrub Never completely satisfied the sum or quotient I took from or carried to, nor do they do so now, Though I'm back here again, looking to calculate, Looking to see what adds up. This transcendental math may raise its own problems of computa- tion, but it removes the poet from the central problem of language: representation. The language of math and geometry evades the problem of using matter to signify spirit; the problem of correspon- dence becomes one of balance rather than resemblance (mirror) and legibility. Structure is imminent: "The idea of God with a compass and a gold protractor in his hand" (Negative Blue 24). Meaning is identified less with image than with structure, which is why the line and its rhythm is so important to Wright. In the line, repeated like a mantra for thirty years, if not in particular words and the myriad of images, he might take up some aspect of the absolute. Increasingly Wright's metaphors come from arithmetical opera- tions, geometric forms, and various kinds of calibration and calcu- lus of gain and loss, the minus sign always in play with an expo- nent on the other side of the equation. It amazes me How landscape recalibrates the stations of the dead, How what we see jacks up [the odd quotient of what we don't see.] (Black Zodiac 34)</page><page sequence="21">C 0 S T E L L 0 345 As Wright goes about improvising the transcendental in this way, he relies increasingly on an assumption of structure underlying form ("Form is finite. Structure is infinite" [Halflife 6]). At other times the terms are reversed, implying a "form" beyond all embod- ied forms, a "deep measure" (Negative Blue 115). If structure (or embodied form) is an additive, an organization of the visible pat- tern, a mode of mental assertion and creation, the erasure of those things might leave "form" (or disembodied, ideal structure), some- thing Platonic and independent of individual artistic intention. And the metaphor of equation allows him to love the natural world. But ultimately, in Negative Blue, the divine is what is beyond structure and form, the "small point at the point where all things meet" (201), so the math remains unsolvable, the formula undiscoverable. The transcendentalist attends to the landscape for the traces of an immortal ideal. Conversely, description provides the constant renewal of abstraction, its natural resource. The pilgrim in Wright pursues disappearances, not presences; beauty is derived not from nature's generous plenitude, not from things or motions, but from the shadows which haunt it and the lights which penetrate it. But Wright is no bodhisattva, mercifully returning from his state of enlightenment, to bring us into the Way. He remains in a state of doubt and desire. He has not written the Paradiso but an Appala- chian Book of the Dead. The world's body and his own body re- main the essential context of his vision, even as it centers on the sky. If the image is agonistic and the ideal unreifiable, the real may be transformed by desire, the mother of figuration. This is not the Romantic organicist vision of transcendental flight or celestial glow, of nature's personhood, but a darker vision in which the in- finite burs into the finite and consumes it, leaving its trace as a charred notation. In this visionary poetry, language is the burning field, consumed with and consumed by the ineffable. Boston University WORKS CITED Altieri, Charles.
