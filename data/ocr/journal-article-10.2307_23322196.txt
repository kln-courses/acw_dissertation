During the sixteenth century, Europeans began to travel as they never had before, and the written and pictorial accounts they produced provide essential material for scholars of both Europe and the wider world. Yet, there is something about the traveller's experience that goes against the grain of the scholarly account. For regardless of its goal, whether it was to grow rich, save souls, establish settlements, or create knowledge, travelling was radically disorienting. To leave one's homeland, attend to the physical demands of journeys by sea or land, and encounter strange peoples without understanding them, was to lose any stable and reliable ground for knowledge. Nevertheless, it is from this experience of confusion that economic historians trace patterns of development in global trade, cultural historians articulate European strategies of representing the other, and anthropologists attempt to create coherent accounts of non-European cultures. From the chaos of travel, the scholar brings order and stability to our sense of the past. 'I hate travelling and explorers', writes Claude Lévi-Strauss, with a knowing irony, in the famous opening sentence of his own travel account through the Brazilian interior during the 1930s, Tristes Tropiques. He hates them because they are so preoccupied with their own bodily limitations - with 'months of travelling, hardships and sickening boredom' - that they distract us from the knowledge that lies beyond these all too embodied experiences. 'The truths which we seek so far afield', writes Lévi-Strauss, 'only become valid when they have been separated from this dross'.1 Two recent books are notable for their efforts to put some of this dross back into our thinking about the visual images that resulted from the travels of Europeans across the globe. Taking the traveller's disorientation seriously, they unsettle our understanding of the making and interpretation of European art in the era of global contact and expansion. Cultural Contact and the Making of European Art since the Age of Exploration, edited by Mary D. Sheriff, is a collection of essays by eight art historians presented in 2006 as the Bettie Allison Rand Lectures in Art History at the University of North Carolina (strangely, the editor never notes the originating circumstances of the essays, though most of them clearly read as lectures). The authors consider a variety of objects and artists, ranging from a sixteenth-century Aztec feather mosaic to the canvases of the early twentieth-century Uruguayan painter Pedro Figari. The authors' goal is to understand 'European art' as a product of mobility and cultural contact rather than as an explanatory paradigm sufficient unto itself. Rose Marie San Juan's Vertiginous Mirrors: The Animation of the Visual Image and Early Modern Travel focuses on a relatively narrow body of imagery - seventeenth-century Jesuit prints - but her aims are ambitious: to rethink the relationship between the visual image and embodied experience in early modern Europe. Travel, she argues, is the linchpin for this new relation. Both volumes build upon a relatively recent body of scholarship that challenges Eurocentric histories of art and literature by considering them through the fraught dynamics of the 'contact zone', a space that, as Mary Louis Pratt defines it in her influential Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation, 'treats the relations among colonizers and colonized, or travelers and "travelees", not in terms of separateness, but in terms of co-presence, interaction, interlocking understandings and practices, and often within radically asymmetrical relations of power'.2 In the contact zone, the in-betweenness of the traveller is a constitutive element and therefore cannot be separated out as dross. And art historians have, to a certain extent, taken up the challenge of thinking in the contact zone. Sheriffs and San Juan's volumes should be placed in the company of studies like Ruth B. Phillips's Trading Identities: The Souvenir in Native North American Art from the Northeast, 1700-1900 466 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012</page><page sequence="2">Reviews (1998) and Serge Gruzinski's The Mestizo Mind: The Intellectual Dynamics of Colonization and Globalization (2002-1999). But if ideas like Pratt's 'contact zone' or Gruzinski's 'mestizo mechanisms' have helped make it possible to conceptualise European art-making and cultural contact, they have done so by focusing their attention outside of Europe proper: Trading Identities and The Mestizo Mind, for example, both focus on art produced in the Americas. Sheriff and San Juan, in contrast, turn our attention back to images circulating primarily (though not exclusively) within Europe itself, but with eyes that are now trained by the ambivalences of travel. Although none of the essays in Cultural Contact and the Making of European Art deal in depth with historiography, Sheriff's introduction frames the book as a disciplinary critique. She argues that 'the prevailing art historiography' has marginalised the significance of cultural contact in the making of European art, and that it has done so through a host of assumptions that include the privileging of distinct national and regional traditions over contact and exchange, the notion of 'Europe' itself as a category that precedes interpretation, the privileging of fine over decorative arts, and the assumption that the sources of European art lie in the classical tradition. Sheriff takes this stance, however, with awareness that the charge of Eurocentrism is one that can all too easily obscure the ways in which cultural exchange, even within relationships of domination and subordination, still takes place. She therefore calls for an art history that can itself be described as a contact zone, a less compartmentalised discipline with 'specialists in vastly different fields working together - or at least drawing on one another's work' (p. 13). The volume's eight essays demonstrate a variety of approaches to practicing art history in the contact zone. Claire Farago examines a feather mosaic created in 1539 by an indigenous Mexican artist working under Franciscan supervision. Situating the mosaic's subject matter - the Mass of St. Gregory, derived from a European print - in relation to contemporary debates about the rationality of American Indians, Farago offers hypotheses about the differing approaches that both European and indigenous audiences might have taken to the iconography of this 'culturally hybrid' work. Julie Hochstrasser focuses on two Dutch paintings - a still-life by Willem Kalf and a Brazilian landscape by Frans Post - and considers the untold stories of global exchange, trade, and brutality that lie behind the objects and places displayed in these works. Christopher M.S. Johns, in an essay that seems rather out of place in the volume, explores how eighteenth-century Rome served as a site of exchange in which elite tourists fashioned themselves through Grand Tour portraiture and, in doing so, helped shape the Roman art market. Elisabeth A. Fraser analyses Eugene Delacroix's North African sketchbook, reading the crisp, careful definition of his drawings - an approach that stands in stark contrast to the dynamic and loose quality typical of his sketches and paintings - as a sign of Delacroix's own hesitation and uncertainty in the face of cultural difference. And in the volume's final essay, Lyneise E. Williams looks at the paintings of Afro-Uruguayan culture created by the white Uruguayan artist Pedro Figari while residing in Paris during the 1920s and 1930s. Williams argues that while Figari's primitivist style is drawn from a European visual language grounded in notions of black inferiority, the artist was nevertheless able to produce a hybrid art through which he renders his Afro-Uruguayan subjects visible. Cultural Contact and the Making of European Art covers a lot of ground, and a brief review cannot begin to address the variety of material and arguments one finds here. But a tendency that runs through many of the essays just mentioned - a tendency that offers one kind of answer to the challenge of art-historical interpretation in the contact zone - is a treatment the artwork primarily as a vehicle for historical content. Farago's appeal to a multicultural history of ideas as the ground for interpretation, Hochstrasser's confidence in the capacity of history to fill the silences of art, or Williams's easy movement between painterly style and racial politics, all direct us towards important contexts, and they lucidly demonstrate the multiplicity of meanings that arise from these contexts. And yet they also raise the question of whether the art historian's chief responsibility is to a content that lies 'concealed beneath the polish of art's surfaces' (Hochstrasser, p. 64). Such an approach would seem to rehearse yet again Levi-Strauss' desire to separate meaning from the dross of travel. One might argue, alternatively, that art-making in the contact zone is characterised precisely by its suspension of anything as coherent as a content (however multivocal) that awaits representation by the historian, and that the challenge of thinking in the contact zone is not the challenge of delivering content, but of learning to think along with this suspension of meaning. Two of the volume's essays stand apart for their nuanced efforts to do just this. In her own essay, Mary Sheriff looks at a self-portrait by the Swiss painter Jean-Etienne Liotard, a sometime resident of Constantinople who, while living in Vienna in 1744, painted his likeness for a picture gallery in Florence. Dressed in the habit of a Christian Moldavian and flanked by painted text that identifies the artist as a Genevan, known as 'the Turk', who executed the self-portrait in Vienna, the painting is a study in dislocation. Sheriff's subtle reading puts the identity of this travelling artist into motion and suspends it there, as a moment of interpretive possibility. As Sheriff notes, we cannot know whether Liotard was in fact as receptive to cultural difference as the self-portrait suggests; indeed, the artist's openness 'might only be an effect of art' (p. 119). And yet she locates her own engagement with Liotard's art on the level of these surface effects, and not with what might lie behind them. In an equally compelling essay, Carol Mavor leads us across the black and blue surfaces of Paul Gauguin's Tahitian paintings. Mavor offers her reader a travel guide - a kind of Guide bleu, as the picturesque French tourist guides were once called - for joining Gauguin on a 'black and blue pilgrimage' (p. 155). Blue, Mavor argues, is the colour of Gauguin's dreams, his nostalgic desire to travel to an exotic OXFORD ART JOURNAL BS.3 2012 467</page><page sequence="3">Reviews past; black is the melancholy colour of that dream's impossibility. But black and blue are not simply the colours of painted dreams: they are also the colours of the bruising racism and colonialism that accompanied those dreams. And yet Mavor takes pause before this historical content. Dreaming along with Gauguin's paintings, she eloquently suspends us between the no-place of Gauguin's Utopian longings and the real Tahiti to which he travelled. Mavor's essay, which in its highly subjective tone stands apart from the others in the volume for its refusal of scholarly distance, is perhaps best described as an attempt to animate Gauguin's art. At Gauguin's invitation, she enters into the dream-world of an artist who rejects representational dependence upon nature and instead creates an art that would be a world unto itself, a space to be inhabited by the beholder's own dreams. But if we tend to associate Gauguin's art with a modernist break from a desiccated early modern representationalism, Rose Marie San Juan's Vertiginous Mirrors ask us to reconsider our sense of the early modern image, and whether 'representational' is the appropriate term to describe it at all. A conception of the image as the disembodied and static placeholder for an absent real, she argues, will not do. When we begin seeing early modern images in the light of travel, new technologies of mobility like print, and new notions of the embodiedness of the subject, then early modern images 'start to move' (p. 4). Like Gauguin's art, they do not ask for our distanced contemplation; they ask to be animated. San Juan begins her book with a close reading of a remarkable print, published in Antwerp around 1590, of a fool's head that contains, instead of a human face, a map of the world. 'Nosce Te Ipsum' ('Know Thyself) reads the text at the top of the print, yet the phrase stands less as an unequivocal directive than as the print's unresolvable problem. The image operates in two registers: that of the human microcosm (the fool) and that of the macrocosm (the world), but the fit between the two is imperfect. The fool mocks the world, but the fool also is the world, and indeed the more one looks, the more the outlines of the continents on the map read as an expression on the fool's face. And yet that map is not a face but an eminently authoritative cartographic representation of the world taken from the 1587 corrected edition of Abraham Ortelius's Theatrum Orbis Terrarum. Between the legibility of this map and the illegibility of the face, the print initiates an oscillating movement between self and world that does not end. The early modern image, San Juan argues, does not presume a relation between self and world; it begins to interrogate it. Travel is the key to understanding image making in this interrogatory mode. Countless early modern images were churned out through the new technology of print in order to aid viewers in the crossing of spatial and cultural differences. But to call these images a mode of 'virtual travel' fails to capture the relation between image and travel San Juan is after. There is a degree of literalness to her approach: images were a means of extending bodies across the globe; they demanded animation, an empathetic embodiment. Vertiginous Mirrors focuses specifically on the travels and images of the Jesuits (the title is itself a reference to a Jesuit text, Joannes David's Twelve Mirrors). And in order to understand how viewers might have activated these images, San Juan invokes Jesuit meditational practice, with its emphasis upon 'the materiality and instability of the body and the bodily senses' (p. 74). Above all, viewers of Jesuit travel imagery sought an empathetic relation to the Jesuit martyr St. Francis Xavier. Francis's martyrdom in South Asia in 1552, San Juan argues, is rehearsed in all subsequent Jesuit missionary travel across the globe. And yet it was an incomplete martyrdom: Francis's body never returned to Rome from Asia, and thus it became suspended in the Jesuit imaginary between preservation and death. Francis Xavier thus introduced a certain ambivalence into the travels of the Jesuit missionary, who traversed vast distances to grow closer to an unknowable body. Each of San Juan's chapters addresses a different type of print that sets this relation between distance and proximity into motion. In her chapter on the 'anthropomorphic image', a striking engraving of a human-faced house in Joannes David's Veridicus Christianus (1601) negotiates the self's resemblance to the world through 'a mirror-like encounter with oneself (p. 62). A chapter on the 'the imperfect replica' examines how the printed portrait of Francis Xavier 'reconfigured the relationship between likeness and bodily contact' (p. 101). A chapter on the 'visionary image' focuses on a print of St. Teresa envisioning Jesuit martyrs and considers the ways in which the image sets into motion a desire for the invisible. And a final chapter on the 'utopic image' explores how the image of the utopic New World city initiates movement. Throughout the book San Juan links this capacity for movement to the actual movements of missionaries across the globe. Through her intricate (and at times rather difficult) readings, she intertwines the travels of specific Jesuits - Francis Xavier, Marcelo Mastrilli, Ignatius de Azevedo, Alonso de Ovalle - with a theorisation of the 'travelling image'. San Juan's primary theoretical debts are to French poststructuralist theory - Louis Marin on utopia, Deleuze and Guattari on faciality, Foucault on resemblance; although one is left wanting a more historicised use of these concepts that would integrate them more thoroughly within the constraints of Jesuit thought. Still, the concepts advance her arguments very effectively. Foucault in particular is an important point of departure for his influential distinction between a sixteenth-century episteme grounded in resemblance (signs are tied together by an endless chain of resemblance between microcosm and macrocosm) and a classical episteme of representation (the sign marks the absence of its referent and is thus constituted by difference). Arguing against Foucault's story of the displacement of resemblance by representation, San Juan sees the persistence of resemblance in the early modern visual image. But she also insists that this resemblance now involves an 468 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012</page><page sequence="4">Reviews element of difference. The new technology of print, she argues, introduced a separation between nature and its image, but this was not a difference that simply settled into a stable system of representation. Instead, San Juan asks us to imagine a world linked together by a chain of resemblances, but separated by traversable distances, and with no end point in sight. Printed images helped viewers to activate this movement, and in doing so they opened a space of self-reflection, a space of transformation in which one might come to 'know thyself, not as one who ever arrives at self-knowledge, but as one always travelling towards it. Vertiginous Mirrors has been published in Manchester University Press's 'Rethinking Art's Histories' series, and indeed the book is a powerful contribution towards that rethinking. San Juan introduces a radical contingency into our sense of the past by treating the early modern image as a site of potential animation without resolution, and as a result the 'early modern' itself becomes a site of openness and possibility. She gives us a model for searching in the past, not for representations whose meanings reflect the necessity of history as it unfolds, but for points of resemblance awaiting our reanimation. And yet important questions remain. San Juan leaves us wondering how far we should extend her claims. What counts as a 'travelling image'? San Juan wants to be clear that, while focusing on Jesuit imagery, 'it is not my intention to situate my study within the institutional autonomy usually accorded to this religious order' (p. 10). Clearly, then, Jesuit imagery stands for a broader phenomenon of animation, and it is not difficult to think of many non-Jesuit examples of early modern images that would lend themselves to thinking along these lines (the Protestant travel imagery of Theodor de Bry's America, for instance). But how far should we extend San Juan's model? One wants to know, moreover, how her thoughts might be situated in relation to other recent efforts to rethink the impact of early modern print technology, such as Christopher Wood's important Forgery Replica Fiction (reviewed in this journal by Christopher Heuer), with which San Juan's arguments have some striking resonances. But if San Juan does not spell out the implications of her argument as fully as she might, Vertiginous Mirrors is at the same time a deeply original, provocative, and sometimes brilliant rethinking of the status of the visual image in early modern Europe. Her readings of seventeenth-century Jesuit imagery convincingly make the case that, in order to get to the truths we seek so far afield, we should learn to travel with images. Notes 1.
