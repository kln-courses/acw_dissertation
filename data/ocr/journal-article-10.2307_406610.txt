<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANGELIKA AREND University of Victoria Humor and Irony in Annette von Droste-Hiilshoff's "Heidebilder"-Cycle In a letter to Wilhelm Junkmann dated 26 August 1839, Annette von Droste-Hiilshoff wrote: Man spannt wieder alle Stricke an, mich zum Humoristischen zu ziehen, spricht von "Verkennen des eigentlichen Ta- lents" et cet. ... Ich meine, der Humor steht nur wenigen und am seltensten ei- ner weiblichen Feder, der fast zu engen Beschriinkung durch die (gesellschaftli- che) Sitte wegen, und nichts kliiglicher als Humor in engen Schuhen.' On the face of it, this statement seems to justify the generally accepted image of Droste as an essentially serious poet whose occa- sional flights of humor are of little or no con- sequence. This image, resulting from the combined agency of historical circumstance and critical prejudice, has remained virtually unchanged in spite of recent attempts to do justice to humorous structures found in some of her poetic works.2 It is important to realize that in the comment cited above, Droste does not attest to her own lack of humor but to her deliberate restraint in its poetic explora- tion on account of the limitations imposed on a woman writer by decorum and convention. I have discussed elsewhere the manifestations of Droste's ever-creative "humorous vein" in her letters to family and friends, and have suggested the need for a reevaluation of the nature and role of humorous elements in her entire oeuvre.3 The present paper offers my first contribution to this comprehensive task. Wolfgang Kayser's important and illuminat- ing discussion of "Sprachform und Redeform" in Annette von Droste-Htilshoff's "Heidebil- der" (1940)4 seems to have dazzled subse- quent commentators into a peculiar blindness to the function and structural significance of clearly perceived humorous elements within this much-touted poetic cycle. Kayser has ar- gued that the characteristic attitude ("Hal- tung") informing the "Heidebilder," as also Droste's other works, is one of intellectual impotence ("geistige Ohnmacht") vis-a-vis an inscrutable reality (236), giving rise to an "Ur- tiimlichkeit eines Sprechens, das zu seiner Wirklichkeit noch keinen Abstand gefunden hat" (241). Nouns without an article, deverba- tive nouns (notably infinitives and collective coinages), unusual genitive combinations, par- ticipial constructions, paratactic sentence for- mation, apposition, asyndeton, anacoluthon - these are the most salient features of An- nette's poetic style that combine to bring about its distinctive prerational character. "So befinden sich die Heidebilder gleichsam noch in einem dichterischen Urzustand vor aller entschiedener Formung" (241). In fairness to this "gebildete und geistig hochstehende Frau" (241) Kayser points out that the observed primal nature of her poetic language is the product of a deliberate fashion- ing process (236). However, focusing on the various aspects of this one "Redeart" he has set out to expose, he does not pay comparable attention to other modes of speaking whose presence he is obliged to acknowledge but whose significance he plays down before any serious examination: "Es gibt Stellen, in de- nen andere Readearten einbrechen, ohne dem Beschreiben eingeordnet zu werden" (241). This, it seems, has to do with the perception of Annette von Droste-Huilshoff as an utterly unsmiling poet- a perception Kayser shares with other commentators." "W~ihrend Goethe The German Quarterly 63.1 (1990) 50</page><page sequence="2">AREND: Annette von Droste-Hiilshoff 51 die Phantasie als Beglickung empfand, spuirte Annette sie vielfach als Qual, als Druck, als Zwangszustand," Kayser explains (236). Agonizing compulsion, of course, must have prompted a style of writing ungraced by any distance from the reality it is compelled to present. An important counterweight to Kayser's pertinent, yet one-sided argument was pro- vided by Clemens Heselhaus (1959). His de- tailed commentary on "Die Heidebilder der Droste"6 throws ample light on the fact that this is a carefully ordered cycle of carefully composed poems, suggesting an attitude of intellectual detachment and control over the reality presented. Informing the skillfully fashioned structure of the whole cycle as well as of the individual poems (their metric form, their images and perspectives), is the princi- ple of contrast and variation. Within this intri- cate pattern of "Abwechslung" (170) Hesel- haus uncovers the significant role played by "Humor and Ironie" (171): "Die ironische Wen- dung [in "Die Vogelhuitte"] kann fiberraschen; aber sie weist uns zur rechten Zeit darauf hin, daB wir das ironische Moment bei dieser geistreichen Frau nicht unterschatzen sollen" (161). As Heselhaus explains, the concluding scene of "Die Mergelgrube" is a humorous depiction of the ambivalence of reality (164); the ironic twist at the end of "Der Hiinenstein" serves to unravel the finely interwoven per- spectives of the poem (166); the various scenes of the poem "Die Kriihen" are spiced with irony (167); "Die Lerche" stands out by virtue of its pervading "ironisch-kokette Ton" (168). Heselhaus made it very clear that humor and irony were well-used items in Annette von Droste-Hiilshoff's poetic tool kit, that she worked humorous elements into the fabric of her poems in the same manner as she em- ployed the "urtiimliches Sprechen" elucidated by Kayser and the related, sensitively differen- tiated "Vokabular ... der Wahrnehmung" on which Wolfgang Preisendanz commented.' It is a curious fact that Heselhaus, who adduced a great amount of evidence to show that the "Heidebilder" are a carefully arranged cyclical whole, did not even raise the question as to the role one might justifiably expect humor and irony to play in the composition of this whole. They were seen to serve individual poems, but their possible function within the cycle did not enter the scope of critical inquiry. Almost three decades later, the obvious question has remained unasked. Even Giinter Niggl's recent discussion of "Die 'Heidebilder' der Droste als Gedichtzyklus"8-- essentially a content-oriented complement to Hesel- haus's form-oriented exposition of the cyclical structure of Droste's "Heidebilder"-fails to break the spell. However, it does seem to point the way to an understanding of how humorous elements, beyond serving indi- vidual parts, contribute to the shaping of the whole. Niggl discusses the tectonic principle of intensification determining the structure of this poetic cycle: a movement from festive lightness and natural abandon (I: 1. "Die Lerche," 2. "Die Jagd") to an increasingly alarming evocation of the ambivalence of na- ture and its subterranean forces (II: 1. "Die Vogelhlitte," 2. "Der Weiher," 3. "Der Hiinen- stein," 4. "Die Steppe," 5. "Die Mergelgrube," 6. "Die Krahen," 7. "Das Hirtenfeuer," 8. "Der Heidemann"), juxtaposed at the end with im- ages of shelter and comfort accorded by reli- gion (III: 1. "Das Haus in der Heide," 2. "Der Knabe im Moor"). I submit that the decreas- ing presence (I, II) or total absence (III) of humor and irony stands in direct relation to this evolving structure. They serve to provide relativizing as well as intensifying contrasts and, as far as they go, a sense of distance and a means of defense against the encroach- ing and ultimately all but overpowering agency of the demonic. The following observations are intended to illuminate this hitherto unseen aspect of the cyclical structure holding together Droste- Hiulshoff's "Heidebilder." They aim to contrib- ute to a better understanding of this widely admired work and its location within the mainstream of historical developments of Ger- man literature in the nineteenth century. The cycle begins with a direct address: "H6rst du der Nacht gespornten Wachter</page><page sequence="3">52 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Winter 1990 nicht?" (1. 1).9 This in-medias-res opening serves two related functions. First, it estab- lishes the presence of a speaker who de- scribes and comments on the natural scenes and activities making up the poem to an im- plicitly present "du." The commentator's role is brought into relief by the negative turn of the question "Don't you hear ... ?" suggest- ing a failure by the "du" to perceive what is there and, consequently, the need for gui- dance and comment. Thus, second, a human perspective has been set up, a perspective that determines the entire poem and is largely the source of its pervading sense of humor. One cannot but smile at the presentation of the sunrise and awakening life in the heath as the rising of a medieval court busying itself around the "princess" or "queen." Such an- thropomorphism is in itself a major factor in the humorous make-up of the scenes pre- sented: the lark acting as herald, the flowers as ladies-in-waiting, the insects as musicians, the ants as miners, the spider as manufacturer --all placing their services, skills, treasures, and wares at the feet of the rising sun. What heightens the humor of all this is, of course, the precise agreement of fanciful poetic image and observed fact: "Die Grille dreht ge- schwind das Beinchen um, / Streicht an des Taues Kolophonium" (ll. 45-46), or at the end of the poem: "Da k6mmt der Wind und hikelt es ['ein Elfenkleid' woven by the spider] vom Heid, / Es steigt, es flattert . . ." (11. 81-82). More effective still, there is delightful irony spicing the description of some actors and their actions: the water lily looks "ein wenig bleich" and "erschrocken" because it was caught bathing (11. 25-26), while the trembling grass, "der Zitterhalm," stands by "verschimt und zage" (1. 27)- a graceful wink at a delicate area of human conduct and decorum. Among the musicians, the bee with its ever-growing "werten Gurt" around its middle provides not only the weighty bass support to the music but also an amusing image of the confusion of material riches and inner worth (1l. 52-54). Humor mingles with compassion when the commentator, calling out to the ants, points up the discrepancy between their honest ef- forts and the value placed on them by the person they are intended to please (1l. 75-76). The humorous lightness informing the en- tire poem- its descriptive passages, its com- ments and direct renditions of the lark's in- structions- is contrasted sharply with the laconic matter-of-factness of the two conclud- ing lines. The past tense used here brings about an abrupt change of perspective and thereby confirms, rather harshly, the termina- tion of the splendid goings-on suggested briefly at the end of the preceding line: Es steigt, es flattert, und es ist verschwommen. - Die Wolke dehnte sich, scharf strich der Hauch, Die Lerche schwieg, und sank zum Ginsterstrauch. (11. 82-84) The anticlimax presented here is sharpened by the countermovement of a culminating rise (of the "Elfenkleid") and an unmediated fall (of the lark, instigator of the entire drama). Giinter Niggl has suggested that the poem "Die Lerche" serves as "eine festlich-barocke Ouverttire" to the entire "Heidebilder"- cycle."' It appears to be a "baroque overture" in a sense more complex than that expounded by Niggl. It is "baroque" in that its fanciful delight in the pleasures of life on earth is kept in check by a sobering awareness of their ephemerality; it is an "overture" (which serves "to prepare the audience for the plot of the play"") in that it sounds both point and counterpoint at the very beginning of the composition. Needless to add that the two opposing forces--one served by expansive humor, the other by cutting laconism- stand in a relationship of mutual enhancement. In accordance with the compositional prin- ciple of "Abwechslung" (Heselhaus), the sec- ond poem "Die Jagd" (31-34) is appreciably different from "Die Lerche." Since there is only one observer, we do not hear a commen- tary but follow the movements of this ob- server's mind as it registers the various scenes and actions. Thus the distance be- tween onlooker and scene appears to have been diminished. Free and imaginative com- ment has given way to objective, meticulously</page><page sequence="4">AREND: Annette von Droste-Hiilshoff 53 detailed observation. The essential objectivity of this process, enlivened but not altered by exclamations such as "Da horch" (1. 10) or "Ha!" (1. 52), accounts for the absence throughout the poem of the kind of humorous interpretation encountered in the preceding poem. However, the somber note sounded briefly at the end of "Die Lerche" is present through- out "Die Jagd"- concealed under a joyful sur- face and largely unnoticed by commentators. In the place of light-hearted humor there is in this second poem a subtly presented, yet forceful irony implicit in the speaker's appar- ently enthusiastic recording of the joy and fan- fare of the hunt by which man causes panic and death in the natural world. To support this interpretation I need not refer to Droste's well-documented empathy with "die lieben Tierchen." The clues are found in the poem itself. It sets in with a sharp contrast juxtapos- ing the peace and harmony of the natural scene with man's noisy intrusion: Die Luft hat sich schlafen gelegt, Behaglich in das Moos gestreckt; Kein Rispeln, das die Krauter regt, Kein Seufzer, der die Halme weckt. (11. 1-4) Da horch, ein Ruf, ein ferner Schall: "Hallo! hoho!" so lang gezogen, Man meint, die Klinge schlagen Wogen Im Ginsterfeld, und wieder dort: "Hallo! hoho!" (ll. 9-13) Such contrast is apt to sow a first potent seed. There can be no doubt, however, that the speaker takes pleasure in observing and de- scribing the ensuing commotion- as when telling us that the fox "zuckelt ffirder seinen Trab" (1. 24), or the hounds pursue him "rad- schlagend an des Dammes Hang" (1. 27). But there are formulations that carry less than amusing connotations, creating an undercur- rent or countercurrent whose presence is sig- nificant: Die Meute mit geschwollnen Kehlen Ihm nach, wie rasselnd Winterlaub. Man horet ihre Kiefern knacken, Wenn fletschend in die Luft sie hacken. (ll. 43-46) To add more detail to this other side of the coin, the cattle, upset by the happy diversion of the hunt, are barely brought under control when another shot and more shots renew their anxiety. Again, a powerful contrast con- cludes this scene: Die kranke Sterke schaukelt trig herbei, Die schaudert, schiittelt sich in hohlem Husten, Und dann--ein Schuf3, und dann- em Jubelschrei! (Ul. 73-75) The latter, of course, is emitted in total disre- gard of the effect it has on nature's uncom- prehending witnesses. The remaining parts of the poem present the wild ritual called "Fuchs-tot-Blasen." As before, there are unpleasant notes to be heard among the sounds of frolicking and jubilation. It comes as no surprise that unsavory associ- ations are again attached to the hounds: Durch das Gelande sieht in wiisten Reifen Man johlend sie um den Hornisten schweifen Sie ziehen ihr Geheul so hohl und lang, DaB es verdunkelt der Fanfare Klang. (ll. 92-95) The greater part of this concluding section is taken up by a direct rendition of the song that forms the central feature of the hunting ritual. No comment is added. The laughter occa- sioned by the death of the quarry has been placed on the stand to incriminate itself: "Hhngt den Schelm! hingt den Schelm! Hangt ihn an die Weide, Mir den Balg und dir den Talg, Dann lachen wir alle beide; Hangt ihn! Hdngt ihn! Den Schelm, den Schelm!-" (Ul. 98-103) I cannot agree with Niggl's conclusion that this poem, as also the preceding one, offers "ein im wesentlichen friedliches Bild der Hei- de, die hier noch ohne Bezug zum Menschen . . . lebt, es sind prachtvolle und genaue Na- turschilderungen, die sich aber mit der Ober- fliche begniigen, noch nicht die unterminier- ten Gruinde kennen."'" It seems to me that it is the commentator who has contented him- self with the surface. "Die Jagd," no less than</page><page sequence="5">54 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Winter 1990 "Die Lerche," anticipates the theme of ambi- valence that Niggl and Heselhaus have rightly identified as one of the major concerns of the "Heidebilder"-cycle. While one poem uses humorous comment, the other employs ironic mirroring, both working with structures of contrast to point to otherwise hidden implica- tions: transience and destruction. The next poem "Die Vogelhitte" (34-39) is related to "Die Lerche" in two ways. Featur- ing a poet, it takes up and makes explicit what was subtly hinted at in the figure of the lark. This little busybody, conscience of the court, seems to be doing something not unlike the activities described in the well-known poem "Mein Beruf' (1841/42; 83-85): to sink back, after the job is done- not dead as "Die tote Lerche" (1844; 432-33) but with a strongly suggested, albeit unspoken, "Es ist voll- bracht." Second, in this third "Heidebild" hu- mor, again, is the dominant stylistic feature. It is generated by the choice of words and images, by irony and gentle ridicule. Playing on the poplular metaphor "Es reg- net in Bindfiiden," the rainbound poet draws a rather unusual and hence comical compari- son between his'3 imprisonment and that of a person who has to endure the pains of listen- ing to long-winded phrasemongering: Und muf3 nun bestehn das Ganze, wie wenn z6gernd man dem Schwatzer Raum gegeben, dem langweilig Seile drehden Phrasensetzer; Und am Kopf nun gehalten oder schlimmer an den Handen, Zappelnd, wie der Halbgehingte langet nach des Strickes Enden! Meine Ungliicksstrick' sind dieser Wasserstriemen Ling' und Breite, Die verk6rperten Hyperbeln, denn Bindfiden regnet's heute. (1U. 7-12) Of course, it is not lost on the reader that his own long lines expose him as one such "Phra- sensetzer." Word humor is present, for example, in the incongruous identification of "diese alte Kufe" and the Danaidean tub (1. 24); or in the irreverent colloquialism "arme[r] Hund von Eremiten" (1. 63). The self-ridicule featured here continues when the disgruntled hermit laments: "Weh! in die diirre Erbs' hab' ich gebissen- / Ich dacht', es seie Zuckerkand" (1l. 67-68). Finally, a nice touch of irony, which again does not stop at the speaker, seasons the self-encouragement he embraces in the face of the damage done: Verkannte Seele, fasse dich im Leiden, Sei stark, sei nobel, denk', der Ruhm ist leer, Das Leben kurz, es wechseln Schmerz und Freuden, Und was dergleichen Neugedachtes mehr! (11. 33-36) These are only the most striking examples of the humorous structures determining the tone of almost the entire poem. Their cumula- tive effect is to generate a sense of distance, of detached yet meticulously dramatized pre- sentation by the speaking poet of an occur- rence totally out of line with his customary pursuits, an occurrence that drew him away from the "Teetisch" and the sips of recogni- tion to be gained there, into the enticing arms of nature. Humor and irony are called up to make light of the impact this unheard-of event had on the stray salon poet. Not only did he, after much grumbling, resign himself to the situation and actually enjoy it ("Wie mir das Klausnerleben so gefrillt" [1. 82]); he created the beautiful poem "Es verrieselt, es ver- rauscht" (11. 85-111)- eloquent testimony to the inspiration he received at the hands of nature, "so ginzlich [geschieden] vom Leben" (1. 123). The utter beauty of this poem acts as a significant counterweight, a reproach as it were, to the speaker's untutored attitude toward nature, as evinced by the disparaging humor of his account. Again, we see Droste- Huilshoff using a contrast to make her point- this time to draw attention to the fascination and power nature holds in store in spite of man's cultivated detachment and assumed superiority, which are attested to very poorly indeed by the speaker's concluding attempt to explain the "funny" event: Nun kommt der Steg und nun des Teiches Ried, Nun steigen der Alleen schlanke Streifen;</page><page sequence="6">AREND: Annette von Droste-Hiilshoff 55 Ich weif3 es nicht, ich kann es nicht begreifen, Wie ich so glinzlich mich vom Leben schied- Doch freilich-damals war ich Eremit! (11. 120-24) I have suggested that ambivalence is one of the main ideas elaborated by the "Heide- bilder"-cycle. "Der Weiher" (39-41), a group of five short pieces following "Die Vogelhditte," bears me out. After the glimpse we have been afforded of the positive power wielded by na- ture, we now become witness to another side. This minicycle presents a number of natural scenes of apparent peace and quiet. However, when it is said of the breeze that it comes and goes "Als fliistre's: Friede! Friede! Friede!" ("Der Weiher"; 1. 12), a signal, be it ever so subtle, has been put into place by the subjunc- tive phrase. The first minor disruption of such peace, caused by a falling twig ("Das Schilf'; 11. 26-27), is soon followed by much louder notes of discord. The oak tree feels harshly treated by the sun and, therefore, mocked by the more fortunate riverweeds ("Die Linde"; 11. 45-51). The latter in turn accuse the tree of envy ("Die Wasserfliden"; 1. 52). The most compelling image pointing to nature's ambiva- lence is found at the very end where children decide not to wade through the water to reach some beautiful flowers because one of them professes to have seen a water sprite at the bottom ("Kinder am Ufer"; 11. 79-83). The absence of distancing humor in all of this is significant. Brought into sharp relief by the preceding light-hearted account, for all the precious beauty described, it strikes yet another somber chord in the cycle's progres- sion from light to darkness. Continuing the pattern of alternation, the next poem "Der Hiinenstein" (42-44) bears some affinity to the previous "Vogelhiitte." A speaking "I" tells of a memorable experience undergone in the heath. However, the narra- tive perspective is substantially different. While the "Vogelhuitte"-poet presents his thoughts and actions directly, in actu (barring the last two lines of the entire poem), the speaker here relates a past event. He tells a gripping horror story leading up to a punchline that eventually breaks the spell. Stanza by stanza he draws his audience deeper into the megalithic grave where he lay on his forehead "wolliistig saugend an des Grauens Stif3e" (1. 33), where he experienced a vision of ap- proaching death but was finally brought back to reality by his lackey calling, "Herr, es reg- net" (1. 74) and realized, with an underlying sense of shame, "Ach Gott, es war doch nur ein rohes Grab, / Das armen, ausgedorrten Staub bedeckte!" (11. 77-78). The sense of distance clearly conveyed by both poems is brought about through different means: through humor and irony in "Die Vo- gelhuitte," through the narrative past in "Der Hiinenstein." What humor there is in the lat- ter poem remains sporadic and subdued. A touch of humorous self-criticism is present in stanza 3: So traiumt' ich fort und, wie ein schlechtes Buch, Ein Pfennigs-Magazin uns auf der Reise Von Station zu Stationen plagt, Hab' zehnmal Weggeworfnes ich benagt Und fortgeleiert iiberdriiss'ge Weise. (1U. 14-18) It is overshadowed, however, by the impli- cation of painful compulsion inherent in the process described. In stanza 8, the disruption caused by a passing peewit gave rise to an abrupt laugh (1. 44) that failed to tear him away from "des Grauens Siilfe" created by his imagination at the instigation of the sur- rounding scene. The only passage with some semblance of humorous distancing is found at the end, where the sudden shot of triviality is administered to cast a cloak of absurdity over the irrational experience in the grave. The sense of uncanny fascination permeat- ing this "Heidebild" accords with what it pre- sents at this particular stage in the entire cycle. It elaborates on what the immediately preceding "Kinder am Ufer" only hints at: the dark power that may also emanate from na- ture, catching hold of the susceptible person who has let down his/her guard. We remember that the narrator had gone out at a time "Als wie ein siecher Greis die Heide lag" (1. 2),</page><page sequence="7">56 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Winter 1990 preoccupied with his own worries and taking little notice of "was es drauBen treibe" (1. 9). It took the unsuspecting intrusion by a less vulnerable person to tear him away from the grip of this power. The following short poem "Die Steppe" (44-45), which according to Niggl is the signifi- cant centerpiece of the "Heidebilder"-cycle, reverts to a presentation of a natural scene that, however, does not merely point to the subterranean presence of "the other" (as do the poems "Die Jagd" and "Der Weiher") but incorporates it in an essential fusion with the observed reality. As Niggl puts it: Die Steppe ist ja mit ihrem halluzinatori- schen Bildertausch von Heide und Meer, von Schafer und Korsar ein einziges Sinn- bild ffir die grundsitzliche Doppelbodig- keit der Welt, ftir den jederzeit m6glichen Umschalg des Friedens in Krieg, des Ver- trauten ins Fremde und Unheimliche, des Heils in die Zerst6rung. (101) The profound ambivalence depicted in "Die Steppe," which marks the point where "Tag und Nacht sich gleichen" (1. 2), precludes the presence of distancing humor of any kind or degree. The next two poems bring the theme of ambivalence to a conclusion by showing, through juxtaposition, that it is a factor to be reckoned with in the interpretation of natural history ("Die Mergelgrube"; 45-48) and human history ("Die Krihen"; 49-54) alike. Structurally, these two poems point back to the first and the last poems of the section preceding the pivotal point at the center ("Die Steppe"). The anthropomorphism of "Die Krihen" and its attendant pervading sense of humor recall the opening poem "Die Lerche," although the perspective has changed from humans looking at nature's inhabitants to birds looking at humans. The imaginative fusion of a speaking "I" with the earth presented in "Die Mergelgrube," and its sudden disruption from outside, enriched by a tinge of humor, recall the final poem "Der Hiinenstein." What has changed in "Die Mergelgrube" is the concluding exchange between the speaker and the person who caused the ces- sation of his dreams. Laconic presentation and comment have been replaced by an extended scene that juxtaposes the speaker's empathe- tic experience of nature's processes of decay and preservation with the shepherd's simple- minded certainty "daB alles Vieh versoffen" (1. 118) and his "pfiffig" laughter at the "ver- riickt" collector of stones (11. 121-22). One view is placed to oppose the other, one strengthened by detailed description, the other by emphatic end-position. It seems fair to suggest, though, that the speaker's humor- ously drastic comment "Er [der Hirte] schaut so seelengleich die Herde an, / DaB man nicht wei8, ob Schaf er oder Mann" (1l. 91-92) cre- ates a perspective favoring his side of the nevertheless ambiguous structure. Significantly at this stage in the cycle, "Die Krihen" features "das Galgenvolk" as it "ich- zet" and "krichzet" (11. 22-24), listening, all bathed in dust, to accounts by two of their elders of events observed long ago in the human world. The "Suade" delivered by the old "Krihenfrau" is brimming with boastful and gory details of human carnage that ulti- mately provided an unforgettable feast to its winged onlookers-a grim, unfeeling remin- der of life's inherently destructive principle. It is relieved by the comical cynicism of the croaking "Scheh'razade" (1. 104), as when she admits to ignorance of Halberstadt's eventual fate: "Wer ihn gefressen hat, ich weiB es nicht" (1. 100); or when she points out how happy she has always been "daB flfigellos, / Ganz sonder Witz der Mensch geboren wer- de: / Denn nie hab' ich gesehn, daB aus der Schlacht / Er eine Leber nur bei Seit' ge- bracht" (11. 57-60). A contrasting view of the human world is offered by "ein grauer Seladon" (1. 110), who steps forth with a paean to a beautiful "heil'ge Frau im Ordenskleide" (1. 112). His admiration of her piousness and "Wunderkraft" (1. 158) is mixed with outrage "da ihr jungfriulich Haar man fiillte" (1. 116)-another reminder of the destructive principle referred to before, but this time one imbued with the warmth of com- passion and regret. It is made light of by the concluding humorous comment on the picture</page><page sequence="8">AREND: Annette von Droste-Hiilshoff 57 this ancient crow presents of eternally un- fulfilled love: Er schlie8t die Augen, st6Bt ein lang "Krahah"! Gestreckt die Zunge und den Schnabel offen; Matt, fliigelhaingend, ein zertriimmert Hoffen, Ein Bild gebrochnen Herzens sitzt er da. - (ll. 167-70) The humorous note sounded here contin- ues to the end: a raven "plumpt von der Fich- te" (1. 172), trying to outdo his predecessors with his story "von Walhall, / Von Teut und Thor" (1l. 173-74), but he is left by his audience to go on rasping to himself. Recalling the "Teetisch" gathering that haunted the poet's imagination in "Die Vogelhtitte," the birds' tall- tale competition seems a compelling parody of the sounds filling "die heitere Stube" (1. 13). It thus adds one more colorful line to the finely woven pattern of the "Heidebilder"-cycle. "Die Krihen," then, with its humorous pre- sentation of images of destruction and death is a swan song, as it were, signaling the im- pending end of the reader's passage through the progressively darkening twilight of reality. After this, "Das Hirtenfeuer" (54-56) depicts young shepherds huddling around the warm- ing fire, sending and receiving, through fire- signal and song, the comfort of human pres- ence in the darkness of the night. A slight touch of humor is injected once again to punctuate the terror closing in on all sides: Hei, wie die Buben johlen, Und mit den Fingern schnippen Die Funken-Girandolen! Wie ihre Zipfelmuitzen Am Ohre lustig flattern. (11. 30-34) The boys' excitement about the newly stoked fire is, of course, a reaction to the uncanny "Dunkel, Dunkel im Moor" (1. 1) surrounding them. The brevity of this exhilarating spell recalls the rise and fall of the morning splendor depicted at the beginning of the cycle in "Die Lerche": Und wie die Nadeln spritzen, Und wie die Aste knattern! Die Flamme sinkt, sie hocken Aufs neu' umher im Kreise, Und wieder fliegen Brocken, Und wieder schwelt es leise. (1l. 35-40) We have here reached the opposite end of the spectrum: darkness is now the prevailing force, admitting but one last humorously tinged comment: Glfihrote Lichter streichen An Haarbusch und Gesichte, und schier Damonen gleichen Die kleinen Heidewichte. (11. 41-44) The duplicity of the comparison of frightened humans and frightening demons finally opens the door to the realm of the demonic. What fol- lows is "Der Heidemann" (56-58), an ever-in- tensifying evocation of the horrors of nightfall in the heath. Contrasting sharply, "Das Haus in der Heide" (59-60) offers an idyllic counter- image of shelter and peace, its concluding al- lusion to the nativity scene pointing to the saving agency of religion. Spinning to the end this thread of Christian sybolism, "Der Knabe im Moor" (60-61) dramatizes a child's horror- filled but successful return "home." Wolfgang Preisendanz has explained the rise to prominence and the constitutive signifi- cance of humor in nineteenth-century German narrative prose as a function of realism and its attendant challenge to the autonomy of the creative imagination: Wir glauben, den Grund ffir sein [des Humors] Hervortreten innerhalb des poetischen Realismus in einer Formpro- blematik entdecken zu k6nnen, in die das Erzdihlen gerdit, weil es besonders stark von dem problematischen Verhiltnis zwi- schen Poesie und umstellender Wirklich- keit betroffen wird.14 Humor, born of a discrepancy between the mode of presentation and the nature of the reality presented, was embraced as "eine Integrationsform, die eine der poetischen Gestaltung scheinbar entzogene Wirklichkeit darstellbar machte" (272). This process had its roots in Romanticism: "Um 1800 sah Fried- rich Schlegel im dichterischen Humor ein Prin- zip, das die Darstellung der Wirklichkeit vor empirischem Materialismus bewahren kinne" (271). It reached its peak in Poetic Realism: "Im letzten Drittel des 19. Jahrhunderts spiel-</page><page sequence="9">58 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Winter 1990 te Theodor Fontane den Humor und seine verklirende Macht gegen die naturalistische Dichtungsauffassung und Schreibweise aus" (271). It seems fair to suggest that Droste-Hill- shoff's "Heidebilder"-cycle occupies a place in an earlier stage of this historical develop- ment. Essentially narrative in character, it utilizes humor or, to borrow a phrase from Gottfried Keller, "[die] Geheimnisse jener doppelsinnigen Phantasie"'5 to present a world fraught with ambivalence and subterra- nean otherness. Of course, this presentation is not a goal in itself; it forms part of a larger scheme in which it provides a powerful nega- tive foil to the ultimate concern of this pro- foundly religious poet. Significantly, however, the function performed by humor and irony by far transcends the modest claims of occa- sional relief, graceful embellishment, or witty entertainment. And to the extent that the "Heidebilder"-cycle realizes the poetic princi- ple that informs the works of poetic realists writing in the latter half of the century, it may be viewed as one of their harbingers, present- ing itself in metric disguise. This is not to say that Annette von Droste-Hfilshoff was a hu- moristic writer to the same extent as were Gottfried Keller or Wilhelm Raabe. But she employed humor and irony in principally the same manner as they did, and the manifesta- tions in her poetic oeuvre of this "'plastisches Gesetz' der dichterischen Einbildungskraft"'16 deserve our evenhanded critical attention.
