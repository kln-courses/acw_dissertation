Among the theoretical works which have been published re- cently in America to explain modern painting and architecture, and to give a more profound aesthetic justification to the forms and method of composition used, there are some which have examined the question of space. In general, they consider that the conception of four-dimensional space, which was introduced by modern physics for the investigation of physical phenomena, has influenced the artistic conception of space. Thus, they say that while in the past the artist visualized his creations in three-dimensional space, now he visualizes them in four-dimensional space, in other words, in space-time. The painter, forsaking the perspective of the Renaissance, and more generally imitation, synchronizes images of a subjective conception of the inner and outer objective world. Through automatic writing and the omnipotence of the dream he represents improbable and complicated conditions of the conscious and subconscious mind. Thus he arrives at "cubism," which is said to be nothing more than "vision in motion."' Cubism "views objects relatively: that is, from several points of view, no one of which has exclusive authority. And in so dissecting objects, it sees them simul- taneously from all sides-from above and below, from inside and outside. It goes around and into its objects. Thus, to the three dimensions of the Renais- sance.. .there is added a fourth one-time."2 The architect attempts, with the contemporary materials at his disposal to do the same: with concrete, to raise his ciibes on piles; with glass, to create transparent dematerialized sur- faces, which permit the facades to be transviewed, the one through the other, and which produce unexpectedly an interchange between inner and outer space. More generally, the architect attempts to suggest impressions which live and can live only in a four dimensional space. The points of view are many, the planes too, and the simultaneity of images in full face and in profile, as in the case of Picasso's "L'Arl~sienne," is technically possible.3 It is this, they say, which makes 1 "Cubism is vision in motion, a new essay at two-dimensional rendering of rotated objects."

A. MICHELIS clear the relationship between modern painting and modern architecture. It is an identity of purposes and results, regardless of whether these thingfs are achieved through other means and by other ways in each of these forms of art. At the center of the problem is placed the contemporary conception of space- time. The examination of this question is of great importance to the theory of archi- tecture and to theory of art in general, because, I believe, there may be many dangerous consequences if this thesis, at least in the aesthetically corrupted form in which it is submitted by these authors, is accepted. For example, there is a theory which maintains that "The history of articulated space, the special space conceptions of different periods, have been determined by the grasp of one, two, three or more dimensions.""' Thus the Egyptians allegedly had a con- ception of one-dimensional space, the Greeks of two-dimensional, and the Gothic period of three-dimensional space, but only in the interior of their buildings, whereas the Renaissance conception was three-dimensional both for the anterior and the exterior. To us finally today is attributed a four-dimensional conception. I do not know whether for future generations a five-dimensional space is pre- dicted. I do not know by what logic this theory conceives of men who have a uni-dimensional conception of space; and particularly as regards to Egyptians who created such buildings as the pyramids, the temples of Thebes and Luxor and so many other works of pictorial and plastic art. And I do not know how a Greek sculpting a "kouros" or building the Parthenon or the theatre of Epidauros can be imagined as having a conception of two-dimensional space only. Of course, the Parthenon was a building turned outwards,6 that is, chiefly a plastic work where the interior space did not play the role which it played later in the Gothic Cathedral, but, in spite of this fact, an interior space existed, and, thereby, a feeling for this. The Greek also had "Bouleuteria" and theaters, and I mention these latter because space is created outside buildings as well as inside and, there too, the feeling of space is conquered by the architect. Furthermore, how could the Renaissance, which acquired a conception of three-dimensional space, succeed in using the Greek morphology which sprang from works with a concep- tion of two-dimensional space only? The question is in need of examination for practical purposes: not only can it lead young students to absurdities and non- sensical conceptions, but it can also lead mature artists to extremes and con- structional acrobatics. The misconception stems, I believe, from a materialistic -the conception of space-time, in short, . . . The aim is not to anchor them (the cubes of the building) to the ground but to have them float or hover upon the site. . .. The glass was called in for its dematerializing quality" (Giedion, op. cit., p. 401 and 404). 4 "Around 1910 Picasso and Braque, as the consequence of a new conception of space, exhibited the interiors and exteriors of objects simultaneously. In architecture Le Corbusier developed, on the same principle, the interpretation of inner and outer space," Giedion; op. cit., p. 408. 5 Moholy-Nagy: op. cit., p. 244. 6 An "Aussenbar" in contrast to "Innenbar" as characterized by Vischer Fr: Aesthetic oder Wissenschaft des Schdnen, (2e Aufl.

The study! of the problem of space in art became im- portantfrom the moment that aestheticians and art critics undertook a thorough examination of the works of medieval religious architecture. The turn of the Christian church inwards, that is, the importance which the interior of the Christian church acquired, as opposed to the classic Greek temple where the rites and ceremonies mostly took place in the open, led them to surmise that from this historical point onwards the interior space of a church became the center of architectural interest. But even at the very beginning they took a great leap; they forgot the Romanesque and, even more important, the Byzantine church;" hence they concluded that the historical point of this shift happened in the Gothic church. With this shift the feeling of the architect for space was strengthened, expanded and finally established. Thus were created the works of Christian architecture in whose interior we admire more than anything else how space tends to appear infinite. This attempt to make space appear infinite was an artistic aspiration con- current with the conceptions of the Christian religion, which then established the one and only omnipresent God, the personification of the spirit, the one who is in Heaven. The artistic aspiration also coincided with the philosophical conception of space of the later Middle Ages in the West, a conception which began to have intimations of infinite space. With the Renaissance, scientific thought clarified the possibility of an infinite space which would be homogeneous, isotropic and three dimensional. Thus, according to a characteristic phrase of Panofsky, "The Renaissance brought down to earth the infinite of heavenly space."9 What was in the beginning a question of faith later became a matter of knowledge. Thence sprang the evolution of perspective during the Renaissance; that is, of the scientific method which made possible to the art of painting the accurate representation of natural objects, having as basis a vanishing point (in the central perspective at least) where all the converging lines meet in the infinite. Thus it was easy to explain the antithesis between medieval painting and the painting of the Renaissance; to explain how medieval painting, in spite of its attempt to show the infinite depths of the Heavens where the Saints and the angels move, had, as Riegl pointed out, no way of doing it convincingly otherwise than by 7Berstl too does not see an interior space in the Greek temple. (Berstl: Das Raumproblem in der altchristlichen Malerei, Forschungen zur Formgeschichte der Kunst alter Zeiten und Volker, herausg. von Eugen Luthgen, Band IV; Verlag Kurt Schraeder, Bonn-Lepzig 1920. p. 37.) Schmarsow (Barock und Rokoko, Leipzig, 1897 p. 5) pointed out as a principle that architecture is in its inner substance an arrangement of space. But this, I believe, must not have the meaning that architecture is not created by forms as are all arts. Space is revealed through forms. As a matter of fact, painting reveals also a space, though an artificial one. 8 A reinstatement of the aesthetics of the Byzantine Church from the point of view of space, is attempted in my work An Aesthetic Approach to Byzantine Art, Athens, 1946, which is to be published shortly in an English translation. 9 Panofsky, Die Perspektive als symbolische Form (Vortrdge der Bibliothek Warburg 1921-25).</page><page sequence="4">74 P. A. MICHELIS the use of the monochrome background. According to Wulff, the painters of the Middle Ages reversed the perspective, according to Berstli" they even abolished the meaning of space, misunderstood or ignored it, and represented their un- natural and distorted creations depicted in two dimensions. In complete contrast, the Baroque systematized the laws of objective vision which the Renaissance revealed, and, perfected the method. It conquered space both in painting and in architecture, to such an extent as to be able to imitate the heavens, and abolish walls in search of the infinite, through a different understanding and fulfilment in architectural composition. Many believe this to be related to the progress of the science of mathematics towards integral and differential calculus. (How few paid attention to the theatricality, if not the ludicrousness of this stage setting is another matter.) Cassirer" however, armed the philosophical investigators of the history of art by his statement that per- spective is a symbolic form of each and every 'Weltanschauung'. But, while he intended to throw light on the problem, the juxtaposition of "mythical" and "cognitive" conceptions concerning space gave rise, in my opinion, to numer- ous misunderstandings. Naturally, the easy and perhaps inevitable course of this historically directed investigation led to the conclusion that contemporary art had followed the road to its present state of evolution because of the discovery of space-time by the physicists, which coincided with the creation of the technical possibilities of the automobile, the airplane, the cinematographic camera, and other such inventions. From then onwards, moving in space, we see from above like birds, and from below like frogs."2 We see both the inside and the outside as if through glass. We see subjectively.'3 We see dynamically. We see surrealistically. From this, they say, spring the two-faced monsters of Picasso, simultaneously front view and in profile, like the Arlesienne, or Le Corbusier's realizations where the "mariage des contours" takes place,'4 or Rockefeller Center's retreating towers which one can see only by turning the eye and thus in a lightning movement com- pounding one image out of many as does the stroboscope.'5 Picasso and the architects of Rockefeller Center would laugh secretly if they chanced to read these monstrous thoughts. It is fashionable now to minimize 10 BerstI, op. cit., p. 110, 112, 79. 11 Cassirer, Ernst: Philosophie der symbolischen Formen. (Berlin, B.

The bird's-eye-view and its opposites, the worm's and fish-eye-views, have become a daily experience.

Only thus are we able to understand the grand play of volumes and sur- faces and perceive its manysided significance."

Is it possible that these latter were aware of space-time? Or did the Byzantines perhaps know about it, since in their paintings indoor and outdoor scenes appear simultaneously, while other scenes, temporally distant, are shown simul- taneously? In the Basilicas too do not the spaces interchange through the arcades? If even this is not acceptable, then today also space-time, this con- cept of physical mathematics, is not enough to explain art unless there exists somehow some cosmic conception to which art can be more easily related. Before advancing to such thoughts, however, let us judge the historical in- vestigation of the problem of space as we presented it previously. I have already pointed out, with a few remarks chiefly about the Parthenon and Byzantine art, that in the course of this serious investigation there are a few lacunae, a few fateful erroneous steps which were perhaps inevitable. 1. In following the historical conception of space, art critics did not pay attention to the fact that space and the feeling of space cannot be the privilege of one particular architecture. No period has brought forth an architecture without the feeling of space. The philosophical conception of space may have begun to exist at some time, but the artistic feeling of space always has existed even though it may have been toneless, even though it may have been differently expressed. 2. By following the historical evolution of perspective, art critics did not notice that they minimized the "visual order" which is inherent in every painting regardless of whether it is designed in correct perspective or not. That is the first and foremost in art. Perspective is simply a technical method and not an artistic requisite. 3. More generally, art critics presumed the existence of an uninterrupted histor- ical sequence towards the evolution of the Renaissance as if it were towards some- thing perfect, because the architecture of the Renaissance reinstated the classic morphology and its paintings systematized perspective scientifically. But this "ideal," this perfection, today at least, can be questioned fundamentally when medieval and primitive art, are esteemed more highly. 4. Art critics did not take into consideration another historical phenomenon of equal historical importance: that every time we abandon naturalism, we cease admiring the arts which were naturalistic and admire the reverse; and this because we are opposed to their spirit. We abandon, therefore, not only their methods but, also in a way, we interrupt the sequence. That is why today, though we know the laws of perspective well, modern painters abandon it and admire Medieval or Egyptian painting which also ignores it. And we underesti- mate the art of the Renaissance as that period underestimated Gothic art and called its works barbarous. We ourselves are also barbarized in asserting the works of the Greeks to be without style and devoid of art, because their knowl- edge of geometry was not so far advanced as it is today."8 5. Finally, in aesthetics, where we must admit that an examination of the 16 Ivins, W.: Art and Geometry (Cambridge Mass., Harvard University Press 1946).</page><page sequence="6">'76 P. A. MICHELIS problem of space was undertaken independently of its historical position, there has been some confusion between the philosophical conception of space and the artistic feeling of space. This confusion of terms arose from the correct belief that world-theory influences the art of each period. But the exponents of this theory failed to take into consideration that in spite of all this, art remains art and as Lipps remarked," aesthetic principles have no history."'7 For how can one otherwise explain that we consider the works of the Egyptians, the Assyrians and the Renaissance to be works of art? Or does our feeling for space in each respective case become uni-dimensional, two-dimensional or multi-dimensional? Let us therefore examine and determine what space means to us. The artsistic feeling of space. Three things must be distinguished: the physi- ological perception of space; the philosophical conception of space, and the artistic feeling of space. 1. The senses by which space is chiefly perceived are the sense of vision and the sense of touch, and modern psychology therefore distinguishes between tactile space and visual space. These sensations do not change in mankind. Mlan is born with visual and tactile capacities; with experience he conquers and widens them, but the sensations themselves as physiological reactions re- main fundamentally the same for everyone and forever. They certainly contribute to the formation of the cognitive concept of space as well as to the formation of the artistic feeling of space, but they can never be sufficient to replace them. If this were to happen, the cognitive concept would degenerate into an instinct and the artistic feeling would be reduced to insignificance, if indeed it did not vanish altogether. 2. The beginnings of the philosophical conception of space can be found as early as the Greek philosophers. Plato calls space "a container of everything which becomes visible and sensible,"' and because philosophical thought has ever since been connected with mathematics, the conception of space has con- stantly vacillated between infinite space, finite space and the finite infinite.'9 The moderns have added the concept of space-time, though even a kind of con- nection between space and time may not have been completely foreign to the Greeks because of the relation of irepas and alrc-tpov with the mythical conception of space, as Cassirer attests.20 Furthermore, if Aristotle indicates the possibility of an infinite, that is a finite infinite not an absolute one. It is found in the eternal sequence of numbers which does not exclude their limitation in the num- ber one, designating the unity of the prime matter of the universe which is limited. In any case, the acceptance of the idea of the absolute infinite from Newton has brought to modern thought contradictions which I am not competent to explain. Nevertheless, the attempt to define the terms gives me the opportunity to remark that they stem from an abstraction that the scientific mind draws from real life in order to understand it. The scientific mind manufactures easeful I7 Lipps: Aesthetic, Vol. I, p. 94 (3-Aufl. Voss 1923). 18 Plato: Tintaeues XVIII 51, 52B.

The artist on the contrary abstracts from real life, not concepts but images, capable of producing emotions. His abstracted im- pressions do not represent life schematically nor do they deaden it or deny to it its unity. That is why for the artist, space is always both finite and infinite and also connected with time. Even if he wished, the artist could not represent only the infinity of space, for he would be representing chaos. Nor could he represent only its finiteness, because thus he would only demonstrate the impenetrable. In the same way it is impossible for him to represent time by itself, or any other cogni- tive concept. The artist can only suggest through images which, even if they do not imitate, at least remind one of life, and with it, of time and space. If the artist were to ponder what space is, he would first of all find that it is in the air which is present between objects which act one upon the other because they build a whole. That means, space is the place where all visible things can be put side by side and in which they can also move, be seen simultaneously, and be consecutively observed; that is, in motion; in time. Immobility for the artist means death, since life presupposes movement, and art is a product of life, a work of spiritual emotion and not a toy of abstract thought. Of course, the coexistence of time and space in art does not mean that from the beginning artists have been conscious of the concept of space-time as it is understood today (with time considered as a simple coordinate-xl, x2, x3, x4, -as a number interchangeable with other numbers).2" Art is not concerned is-ith the conscious conquests of thought which are always poorer than life because they are conceived schematically. When it listens to them, or believes them, it paraphrases them in its imagination in such a way as to satisfy life. For this reason then, it is logical that space-time may exist potentially in primitive art, just as in contemporary art something primitive exists without our being primi- tive; hence the mutual sympathy. It is, therefore unnecessary for Berstl to try, through logical acrobatics, to demonstrate that he had found the concept of space-time in medieval painting. As John Dewey says about space-time, "The artist made in action if not in conscious thought this belated scientific discovery from the very beginning."23 It is an abuse of terms when art critics say that the architects of the Christian church attempted simply to represent the infinity of space, or the architect of the ancient temple, its finiteness. The truth is that both appear as a finite-infinite. However, the one tries to create a transcendental feeling of space and so to arouse the imagination of the observer to a place where it can accept the exist- ence of the omnipresent Divine Spirit. The other tries to suggest a calm feeling of space, and thus create the interior where the anthropomorphic gods, the gods of Olympus, can live. Both spaces appear to be ideal spaces, as the gods are ideal persons, and, were it otherwise, the church and the temple would decline in our eyes to the level of the trite. The aesthetic suggestion of ideal space, a space 21 Cassirer: op. cit. Vol. II, p. 149. 22 Berstl: op. cit., p. 110. 23 Dewey, John: Art as Experience (Seventh Impression), p. 183.

MICHELIS which appears as if it were disassociated from the real space, as if it were in the place where imagination transports us, is created by art through the artistic feeling of space. Before analyzing the artistic feeling of space and time, we must observe that it bears no relation to the "mythical" space and time as this was conceived by Cassirer, as it influenced many art critics.24 According to Cassirer, the three basic forms that compose the structure of the mythical world are space, time and num- ber (II, 174). Their mythical conception is full of feeling. It is a qualitative, concrete conception, and not a quantitive abstract one (II, 136-137). That is also why it takes an intermediary position between the physiological impressions of the senses and the cognitive conceptions of time, space and number which dominate each period. It is, I would say, a belief of subjective hue-a 66oa, to use a Platonic term-a product of faith, a mixture of traditions, religious con- victions and philosophical conceptions. The more science and philosophical knowledge advance, the more mythical conceptions retreat. Astrology becomes astronomy, alchemy becomes chemistry, al kabala becomes algebra and geome- try. And the seeds of the mythical conception remain in the subconscious. Conse- quently, the mythical conception cannot replace the artistic feeling of space, time and rhythm, where the arithmetical relations, either in the form of analogies or in the form of rules of harmony, etc., infiltrate. Aesthetic experience undoubt- edly contributes to the formation of the mythical conception, but this latter, which differs each time and every now and then retreats, is not equivalent to the aesthetic experience of time, space, and the analogies of forms, which remains unchanged. The meaning of orientation in mythical space can perhaps elucidate the need of orientation of a church, but is not an artistic prerequisite which explains the art of the church. The cabalistic meaning of the number two or three is not the same thing as the meaning of the number two as denoting how many columns we have, or as derived from the analogical relation 2:1. These are relations to which different aesthetic experiences correspond. By the same token, the mixing of two liquids of different colors would have a different meaning for the alchemist or the priest from that which it has for an artist concerned with the color com- bination. 3. The artistic feeling of space is that pleasant emotion which we have when we enter a room which is architecturally significant, and feel that we fit into it comfortably. We are aware of a sense of freedom to walk in an unlimited space and at the same time a feeling of being enclosed in an embrace which welcomes us like a nest where, though we are enclosed, we are also free. The feeling of space, however, vacillates between the dual and contradictory coexistence of the two impressions, the impressions of an environment which is at the same time closed and open, where space is at the same time finite and infinite. We get the same impression from the heavenly sphere which, though in our imagination it appears infinite, yet at the same time forms an embrace around us with the circular line of the horizon and the blue dome of the heavens above, like an all-containing womb. In truth, the most pleasant feeling of space which 24 Cassirer: op. cit. Vol. II.</page><page sequence="9">SPACE-TIME AND CONTEMPORARY ARCHITECTURE 79 we get is that which we have in the open when we turn our eyes and capture the image of the heavenly dome which freely embraces everything without imprison- ing it in the finite and without leaving it exposed to the chaos of infinity. For this reason also the feeling of space is born more easily when we are in the hollow of an ancient theater or under a dome like those of the Pantheon or of Hagia Sophia, which imitate more or less the circular line of the horizon and the sphere of the heavens. While in the open we can either stand still or move ad infinitum forward or backward, up or even down; in a space created by man we cannot do so, because it is always limited. Art, however, has the means of satisfying this need, when the enclosed spaces have appropriately spaced openings for lighting in their walls, and their forms have the proper conformation and are harmoniously propor- tioned. Then, our eye following the circle glides effortlessly and our soul rejoices. Thus the impression of eternal flight and eternal return which the eye gets when it combines variety into unity, and the joy that our spirit feels as a result, satisfies us, and we wish to remain in that place, as if we were in the open. Furthermore, we have here the joy of our imagination travelling in a harmonious world all around us, and, while we live in space and time, we live now so effortlessly, so pleasantly, in our imagination, that we step out of time and space. We live in the aesthetic sphere of life, in an imagined space and time which are apart from the real ones. All these things happen of course before we even begin to concen- trate our attention on the individual forms or to judge them. The feeling of space is naturally more difficult to create in buildings which do not have a concave shape but are rectangular and are covered by a flat roof. The advances of the walls, sometimes the corners, and especially the convex shapes, provoke the impression of impenetrability which is followed by a feeling of constriction. The spiritual space is narrowed. On the other hand the opening of a long and narrow corridor which appears to the mind like a cut towards the infinite gives a feeling of endless flight. The light plays also a great role. Darkness in a space gives the feeling of chaos; though you are free to move at will you do not know where to go and you remain transfixed. The same is true of too much light, which blinds you. However, it attracts you and, when it comes from above, it gives you the feeling of apotheosis. Only the equilibrium of these contradictory and extreme emotions brings peace to the building, and this equilibrium presup- poses order, rhythm and harmony, both in the voids and in the solids, in the stepping and in the advances in lights and shadows, in the relation of the forms which we see when we are in bodily and spiritual motion within the buildings. Then, the formlessness of the space which they contain takes shape because, in the last analysis, space is not visible otherwise than through forms. Then the immeasurable can be measured and the endless can be ended without becoming the impenetrable. That is, the voids and the solids, the supporting and supported members, are arranged so that the spiritual order of the world appears, which, at bottom, is what every significant work of art reflects. The juxtaposition of these contradictory initial impressions and of the extreme emotions which they provoke shows that in art it is possible to play with them and to synth-eize them in various ways. The architect may tead us first through</page><page sequence="10">80 P. A. M1CHELIS a narrow corridor and then introduce us to a spacious chamber, or do the re- verse, leading us from the spaciousness of an atrium into the long and narrow nave of a church. It is also possible for him to attempt to reach the extremes by suggesting to us the feeling of a closed and mysterious space, or of an endless and transcendental one. Christian art aspired to transcendental space and in both types of church which it created, the basilica and the centrally planned church, it succeeded. In the basilica, by stressing the longitudinal axis, the architect created an acute feeling of flight, while simultaneously with the stepping of the three naves he induced an upsurge of the soul towards the central nave where the light is more intense. In the centrally planned church, starting from the vertical axis and spreading the centrifugal force through the openings of the central nave towards the circumference, he diffused the glance in depth, while simultaneously he at- tracted it to the height with the sphere of the dome where the soul vibrating is received by the light. There, in a transcendental atmosphere, ethereal, immeas- urable, endless, like that of the starry heavens, the imagination places the divine spirit and lives within it. Egyptian religion on the contrary aimed at the closed but mysterious space, the magic of darkness. Having prepared the observer with the feeling of flight which is created by the endless row of sphinxes and the alternation of gates and atria, it introduces him finally to the covered spaces of the temple where the goal is the complete darkness of the inner sanctuary, the creation of an artificial night. And it is natural that this effect should be sought by a religion attached to the survival of the dead on earth, as opposed to Christianity which believes that the soul survives in heaven. Darkness brings down to earth and inspires fear. Light deifies and encourages. Between the two extremes the pagan religion of the Greeks, who believed in the right measure in all the expressions of their life, created temples where semi-light reigned in the interior and the feeling of space was calm, as calm as are the faces of their dead on their funeral stelae. In every case when the faith is different, the way of expressing it is different, but for them all the feeling of space is the sine qua non of creation both of internal and external architecture. It is as impossible for architecture to exist without it as it is for music to exist without the feeling of time. Space and time. We have seen that for the artist, space and time are inter- woven, because when the artistic feeling of space is born within us, an imaginary environment is created where our imagination can live and move freely. Without time, this space would be a place of dead images. Without space, time would be like a cinematographic film without a screen on which to be projected. But let us examine the question of time in greater detail, as it is of importance even to architecture which is static. Years ago, Borissavlievitch said that architecture, from the aesthetic point of view, is an art of time.25 As a proof, he drew attention to the fact that if two lines a and b are of equal length, but b is segmented, it will appear longer than a. As an explanation for this optical illusion, he suggested that we need a greater length of time to cast our eye over line b than over line a because the interrup- 25 Borissavlidvitch: Les Theories de l'Architecture (Payot 1926) p. 41-42.</page><page sequence="11">SPACE-TIME AND CONTEMPORARY ARCHITECTURE 81 tions retard us. In other words, what the eye "sees," depends on the time taken in seeing, and, therefore, architectural form is a function of the time necessary for the eve to travel over the parts of the building. The relations between the parts and the proportions depend on time, and, consequently, architecture is an art of time. SMy thought coincides somewhat with the position taken by Lipps,26 that these illusions are due to the "Einfifhlung" which sees even in lines a tend- ency-that is, a force in action. Proof of the fact that these optical illusions have their source in deeper psychological and spiritual causes, and not simply in some mechanism of the eye, is contained in the fact that always, however much we know we are going to be deceived, the illusion persists.27 The example of Borissavli'vitch teaches that the schematic and materialistic approach to aesthetic observations which are delicate and profound in fact ridi- cules them. The same is true when we are told that the architects of Rockefeller Center see as the stroboscope sees, and that finally even the ignorant spectator learns how to see in this way. In a word they abolish the spiritual and psycholog- ical properties of man, by which alone he can enjoy a spectacle aesthetically, and put their trust in the mechanism of the visual organ or in the properties of matter. They think that a glass wall is sufficient for us to see two facades simul- taneously, or that certain apertures are enough to connect the inner and outer space, or that it is sufficient in order to live in contemporary space-time that the eye grasps the parts of a building and unifies them. Glass indeed facilitates vision. But vision passes also through the walls by memory, by listing impressions which are separated in time and by connecting them later when guiding lines unify and connect the impressions, that is when the building is a work of art. When in fact these lines exist, the imagination can also foretell the facades that it does not see. It is sufficient that the imagination should be set in motion and it is set in motion only when the work is a work of art. The fact that eyes may con- nect two facades immediately and simultaneously, thanks to the use of glass, does not persuade us of the artistic value of the work. Spontaneous artistic emo- tions in architecture do not spring from material feats of this kind but from the proper use of scale, from the pleasantness of light and shadow, from the feeling of space and from the associative impressions which follow the creation of form. Does not the observer of the Parthenon receive the impressions of the interior and the exterior simultaneously while perambulating around the building by catching successive glimpses of the interior through the colonnades of the portico and the open door? Does not the observer of the Christian Church see the central nave through the colonnades of the side aisles? Does he perhaps forget the im- pression of the narthex which preceded it? Surely if he forgot all these impressions or failed to connect them, he would have no impression at all. In the history of architecture, people have often attempted with mirrors, with stage settings, with optical illusions and with tricks of all kinds, to give unex- 26 Eiipps: Raumaesthetic und geomnetrisch-optische Tdiischungen (Barth 1897). 27 The explanation according to Gestalt psychology would be another one; the.whole form being assy-metrical. Thanks to the segmentation of line b, this line suffers the disforma- tion of the whole and appears longer, because the properties of the parts depend on the wholle.

MICHELIS pected impressions and to depict a supernatural world so as to bring us artificially to the ideal space and time of the imagination. But they have always failed when they have depended only on artificial or mechanical properties of matter or of vision, not on the artistic properties of suggestion which images have on the imagination. Let not these theories guide modern art also towards false con- clusions. The dome of the Pantheon at Rome has a lantern, an aperture in the roof through which the light, the natural light of day, falls into the building. The material sphere of the dome ends at this aperture and is completed by the sky, which draws the eye upward to its heights and thus creates an unexpected inter- change between inner and outer space. And yet, the architects of the Byzantine church who wish to suggest a religious uplifting in the soul of the observer did not employ this method, but the reverse. The shell of the dome of Hagia Sophia whose central space is closed, is lighted from the lower side windows which are made of glass, from which the real sky is not visible. And yet, though the inner and the outer space are incompletely connected, the dome of Hagia Sophia suc- ceeds in appearing more ethereal than the dome of the Pantheon, and this sus- pended sky more ideal than the real one. Why is this so? Some people will think that this is due to the fact that the dome of Hagia Sophia is supported on four arches while the dome of the Pantheon is supported on a circular base. However, as the Dome of St. Peter's in Rome proves, this is not enough. The real reason is that the whole composition, the niches, great and small, the ring of the windows, the proportions and the moldings of the forms, succeed in creating an ethereal feeling, and suggest to our imagination a transcendental space. And who would maintain that by making the dome of glass a better result would be achieved? We would only have a skylight, as we have in stations, in libraries or in banks, where practical reasons lead us to use glass for more light and not for "the" light. There is of course a poetry of glass as there is a poetry of every material. But this does not lie simply in its physical properties, in the fact that it is transparent. Opaque materials can also have a poetry. Water is also transparent, but in order to enjoy it we do not consider only its transparency but also the reflections it makes when it is calm, or the course it follows as a waterfall or a fountain; that is, we enjoy it when it creates unexpected forms that arouse our imagination, and not because it satisfies our technical curiosity, or our knowledge, or facilitates our vision. These satisfactions have never created self-sufficient artistic impres- sions, that is, a harmony of movement and emotion in our souls. In glass, the vibrations of light, the glancing of the rays, their spectacular refraction, the design of the connecting links which hold it together and its smooth shining and transparent surface side by side with other materials which reflect or absorb light, can give impressions of interest to the imagination, when the whole form which is depicted by them is of artistic value. Glass however is directly connected with light. Light has movement. And movement implies time in space. Finally, light in passing through glass shows us, as it were, the pulsation in the interior of matter. Modern art. Where then is to be found the originality of modern art, since it</page><page sequence="13">SPACE-TIME AND CONTEMPORARY ARCHITECTURE 83 cannot lie in the representation of space-time, and since art has always exploited the possibilities of space-time? There is no doubt that contemporary painting depicts, on one surface, images of one and the same landscape or person seen from various points of view. But these partial representations would not constitute a work of art if they did not contribute to unity. The photographs of the stroboscope or other combined photographs of one and the same person do not constitute a work of art. The synthesis of many images into one creates a new image whose parts have an artistic value, not because they are different views of the same thing, but because they are indivisible members of a new whole, towards which and towards each other, they have a relation of scale and of rhythm, of harmony and of color. To this is due the decorative appearance of modern art which explains much, hides much, and confuses much. Of course, dissecting Picasso's L'Arlesienne in my mind, I see a profile and a front view, but the moment I separate them they lose their value and are reduced to a fortuitous profile and a chance front view, of somebody, but not of this Arlesienne. For this Arlesienne is a form, a monstrous form of course, but unified. It is a hypostasis seen through other eyes-the eyes of the artist's soul. Picasso presents her in a way which attempts to show a psychologically complex hypos- tasis, but he also creates her as a symbol. Only as symbols do the forms of the two faced Janus, the unnatural Centaur or the mermaid, that improbable creature, half woman and half fish, which entices seamen at sea, become explicable. Of course, the Arlesienne differs from the mermaid. The mermaid is an un- natural being which combines contradictory physical properties so as to arouse the imagination, and is a being seen statically, because it appears as a unified creature, that is, synthetically. The Arlesienne, however, is a natural being, only seen dynamically because she appears as a divided creature, that is analytically. The painter of the Arl6sienne, wishing to express her psychological complexities, paints the impressions he receives from the whole series of the reactions of this being to the drama of life, but he presents them in one integrated picture and thus makes a personality: an improbable personality, a monster which startles the imagination, but a picture which does not destroy the impression that it concerns one and the same hypostasis. Otherwise even our imagination would be indifferent. The painter has chosen for his purpose a characteristic series of moments which permits the synchronization of conflicting expressions He has chosen the series of fertile moments and thus harmoniously integrates the differ- entiated morphological expressions into one symbolic form. Art has always done this, but in another way. In order to represent the idea of dance through a dancing creature for instance, it chooses not a series but one fertile moment of the dance and presents a being which, though unnatural in appearance and non-existent to the photographic lens, is convincing and fertile for the artist uwho wishes to suggest to the observer the idea which it symbolizes and which a photograph could not do. In the last analysis this is all that is done by cubists and surrealists, except that instead of presenting one characteristic form, they parade many and regroup them synchronized in a strange form. Thus, instead of elevating us to the idea of the dance, they bring us down to its pulse.</page><page sequence="14">84 P. A. MICHELIS The older art was ideological, representing the symbol of the idea. There the eye stopped, having brought the imagination to a peak and leaving it there free to move afterwards as if it would film an imagined dance. Contemporary art, on the other hand, rather symbolizes the pulse of the dance and not the idea. It confuses the eye but moves the imagination, leaving it afterwards to syn- thesize what has been presented in synchronized analysis. Modern art, therefore, has descended from the world of ideas to the world of reality, since the art of ideas had been misrepresented and had degenerated into hollow presentations and hollow words. But to what "realities" of the world has art descended? Not of course to "ap- parent" reality, for we can easily observe that while the older art represented natural creatures in order to symbolize what it wished to show, modern art chiefly presents unnatural creatures, monstrous hypostases, dream allegories or decora- tive dissonances in harmony. Aspiring to the expression of the complex and im- measurable depths of the psychological world, to the analysis of the subconscious mind, it presents dream images to the observer and demands for this work of black magic that he should complete the work of a seer. On the other hand, intending to discover the structure of the object and show the pulsating and in- terchanging quality of the material expressions of energy, and not being a science like chemistry or physics, it abstracts rigid, unbending forms and compounds the lights and colors into strange relationships; it fractures the forms on various planes; it changes the attitude and the point of view and suggests a work of alchemy, to complete which the observer must know that art is seeking gold. Ancient art, in contrast, showed the gold, and artists were seers, explaining dreams. The new art has become realistic, if not materialistic, as opposed to the idealis- tic. It has simultaneously become imaginative, if not magic, avoiding at all costs the forms which the eye of the common mortal catches from the spectacle of the world, so that it can awaken that which is hidden beneath them and invoke their mysterious relationships. Since it is an art, that is, a product of the intuitive and emotional world, it can only do this through dream images and the alchemy of abstract forms. Modern art is in this way an impressionism of being and not of appearing and is in fact, dynamic and not static. It is an impressionism il- lumined not by the analysis of external light, as was the older impressionistic art, but by the analysis of spiritual light through the intricacies of the soul and through the structure of the material world. It presents to us, in this spectroscope and through this light, the multicolored spectrum of every particular psychologi- cal entity or pulses of the causal urge (entelechy) of beings, and leaves us to guess what they contain, what they envision, just as science guesses the composition of the stars from their spectra. How did art arrive at this point? I do not deny of course that the motor car, the airplane, the submarine, the photographic camera, the moving picture, psychoanalysis, the theory of relativity and the many other technical and scien- tific achievements of our period have influenced artistic inspiration. They have never done so, though, in the pedestrian way which is usually supposed by the unsophisticated but high-sounding critics, nor in the way in which some artists</page><page sequence="15">SPACE-TIME AND CONTEMPORARY ARCHITECTURE 85 (such as Marinetti) themselves believe. The artist creates, as long as his imagina- tion remains healthy and does not attempt to imitate the prosaic impressions which anyone can get from an airplane journey, or from Freud, or from Einstein's theory. The artist avoids the prosaic, he avoids the ridiculous. (He would become ridiculous if he grappled wAith the theory of relativity.) He avoids the ordinary, because from all these idols and theories and impressions of his period he draws vital experiences and with his imagination creates the myth of his epoch. And the myth of motion, the myth of relativity, the myth of Freudian existence, is something different from the motion of machines, from the Freudian theory or, Einstein's theory of relativity. Myth is conceived by the imagination of the seer, the imagination of the artist. Because of his imagination, the artist does not have to wander like an ignoramus, to appear ridiculous as a man without judg- ment, or to think like a scientist, for, with its help he can grasp ideas and create symbols of the myth, representative images which suggest analogous vital experi- ences to the observer, for motion, relativity and Freudian complexes. Such myths, such symbols, such vital experiences, are clearly not a privilege of our time be- cause Icarus, Oedipus and Hamlet have existed, if not since the beginning of time, at least before the invention of the airplane, before the mind became con- scious of the Oedipus complex and before we were scientifically aware of the relativity of physical phenomena and the dilemma of existence. The fact that today certain creations of the imagination can be technically realized, that certain psychological relations are understood, or that certain philosophical conclusions acquire a mathematical expression, contributes only by bringing these possibilities to the center of interest of the civilization of our time, and thereby making of them the foremost and sovereign subjects of every- day thought and life. Even today, however, art cannot be inspired by the prosaic conception and the ephemeral form of such theories, unless it both seeks and finds their inner meaning. The only way in which this can be achieved is for it to ,ive life to the myth of the new reality and present, as we said previously, subjects which are original and symbolic both in form and content and capable of movingr us aesthetically. But contemporary art is yet incapable of creating myths because, unlike the older art it is not ideological. It is materialistic. It can only dream, it can not prophesy. It can only charm, it cannot satisfy. Hence, in modern art, the myth has been replaced by the dream. The myth presupposes an idea; the dream ad- vances towards an idea. Because the only emotion, or knowledge, or experience we seek from art is an aesthetic emotion, the artist imagines and we seek also to imagine. The artist creates and we also seek to create. The artist symbolizes for this lp)upose and wve also seek symbols, in order to communicate with him and among ourselves, since we are neither scientists nor philosophers. Even if we were, we would Awant symbols from art, because in the symbol there is something more than there is in the concept or in the theory. To summarize, then, contemporary art does not start from the ideological position and value of the objects it depicts as symbols in a religious creed, as it did of old. It is directed chiefly towards the structure of things in themselves</page><page sequence="16">86 P. A. MICHELIS and to their secret hypostases and interrelations, which are enlightened by mod- ern science and world theories. From the impressions gained by this materialistic approach it attempts to compound a dream aspect, a magic aspect of the world. And now about architecture. What is its new spirit? The free plan is not something new in contemporary architecture; the Middle Ages made use of it. Nor is the raising of cubes on piles, because if it were, even the huts of the primitive lake dwellers would be modern; nor does a building become lighter because of piles, if it has no grace. Its novelty does not reside in corner windows or the absence of corner pillars, because both the horizontal and the corner window, as well as the cantilever were known of old, especially in wooden houses. It is not the curtain wall, which is known to oriental art, and is found in the narthex of Hagia Sophia. It is not the dematerialized wall which is well known to Byzantine art, without the wall being made of glass, for glass in fact shows that the wall is material. It is not the unification of particular spaces, nor the interchange of interior and exterior space, etc. All these things together contribute, but they are only exterior marks which can also have an aesthetic significance when they are not conquered by external means. More profoundly, however, the novelty of modern architecture lies hidden in the new sovereign constructional potentialities of steel and reinforced concrete, which govern the morphology and the expression of all contemporary architec- ture; the steel-truss work and the homogeneous, monolithic skeleton of slabs and pillars. We have here the constructional possibility of articulating tremendous truss works and of pouring a one-piece structure. This new conquest has im- posed a new conception of statics for the relation between supporting and sup- ported members, and suggests to the observer who experiences the forms which they present, a new feeling for the static. A truss work architecture in wood was known, it is true, but without great possibilities. In India, it is also true, we have monolithic temples carved in rock, that is, works of sculpture which are internally empty, but these are not constructions. Today, for the first time, monoliths can be poured which have an unexpected resistance and unexpected material properties. These are the new elements of an architecture which is principally constructivist, and of which all the technical possibilities (cantilevers, the setting back of columns from the facade, etc) and all the morphological manifestations (corner windows, mushroom columns, etc), are only consequences. Furthermore, this architecture attempts, not as the old monumental archi- tecture did, to symbolize an idea, but first of all to serve man. It is an architec- ture almost without ideas, which has sacrificed everything to utilitarianism. However, because it knows that even if it succeeds, it will not be an art for this reason only, it also seeks, by elevating the poetry of the material, by appealing to the phantasmagoria of light and, through the expression of extreme technical possibilities and exotic forms, to arouse the imagination, to transport it to a space of dream vision or to the space-time of dream vision. This is a fatal step in a period without religion, which yearns to be convinced of the myth of the om- nipotence of contemporary man's science, or rather of its magic.</page></plain_text>
