<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TERMINOLOGY OF OLD TESTAMENT RELIGION AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE G. ERNEST WRIGHT Theology in large measure is inevitably anthropomorphic. Char- acteristic of the normal religious mind is the attempt to visualize God and man's relation to him, and the resultant picture is usually derived from social relationships. Thus in modern Christianity, and indeed in the New Testament itself, the relationship between God and man is conceived as one between a benevolent father and his son or children. As the father loves his children, so the children should love their father and honor him. In the Old Testament, however, this father-son picture is curiously and significantly rare. The terminology of Old Testament religion is primarily centered around the conception of God as "lord," "sov- ereign," or "ruler." Indeed, the conception of Yahweh as the ruling Master or Lord can be said to be the basic proposition of the theology of the Old Testament.1 Following the social pattern here envisaged, therefore, man would not be thought of as a "child" of God but as a "servant" or attendant of his ruler. Thus, "to be religious" is ex- pressed by the word Yabad, "to serve," or by the word shiamai, "to hearken, to be obedient'; and it is the fear of, reverence for, or proper deference to the great Master which is the beginning of wisdom. Paul has reference to this Old Testament conception when in Rom. 8:15 he speaks of "the spirit of servitude unto fear" (pneuma douleias eis phobon) and contrasts it with the spirit of adoption into sonship "wherein we call, 'Abba, Father.' " The conception of God as the ruling Lord seems to have been very ancient in Israel. Among the earliest references are those in a tenth- century document, the Court History of David, and in other passages 1 Kohler, Theologie des Alten Testaments (1936), pp. 11 ff.; cf. also Hempel, Gott und Mensch im Alten Testaments (1926), p. 137; Baudissin, Beitrdge z. alttestamentliche Wiss. (Budde Festschrift), XXXIV (1920), 1 ff. 404</page><page sequence="2">THE TERMINOLOGY OF OLD TESTAMENT RELIGION 405 which may be of the same date.2 The terminology is also present in the JE strata of the Pentateuch, where God is referred to as 3Ad6nay, Ad6nay Yahweh3--once indeed [Exod. 34:23] as hd-aAd6n), "the Lord (Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel)"-while it is customary in prayers for a man to speak of himself as God's "servant." 5Ad6nay Yahweh is the favorite appellation of Amos for God,4 and lAd6n or 5Ad6nay continues to be used throughout the later literature. In Judaism, as is well known, the latter is used in place of the name Yahweh. A clear reference is that in the Gideon story (Judg. 8:23): "And Gideon said to them: 'I will not rule over you; nor shall my son rule over you. Yahweh rules over you.' " Parallel to this usage is the appellation "king," which from the time of the monarchy (if not before) was frequently applied to Yahweh.' Since Yahweh was the true "king" of Israel, prophetic groups, in wholehearted allegiance to the theocratic ideal, at least as early as the eighth century became suspicious of the value of an earthly king, and in Ezekiel the leader of the Golden Age is not to be a king but a n~ts1 "chieftain.'"6 The picture of God as ruler and of man as his servant is remarkably homogeneous in the Old Testament. Thus Yahweh is also judge, law- giver, the source of equity, warrior, savior. This is well expressed in Isa. 34:22: "For Yahweh is our judge; Yahweh is our statute-giver; 2 Thus II Sam. 12:22, a reference to Yahweh being "gracious," a term which will be dealt with further below. Note also II Sam. 15:8 ("serve Yahweh"), 15:25, 18:19. The same terminology is to be seen in II Sam. 23:3, 24:10; I Kings 8:22 if., 32, 43, 56, though the dating of these passages is not entirely certain. For an additional early passage see n. 5. 3 Gen. 15:2, 8; 20:4; 18:3, 27, 30-32; Exod. 4:10, 13; 5:22.

Hosea, of course, makes no use of Adon. 5 One of the earliest references ynay be in the Balaam poems (Num. 23:21), probably dating from the time of the monarchy. While the interpretation of this verse is somewhat uncertain, poetic parallelism suggests the divine rather than the human king. Cf. also I Sam. 8:7; 12:12; Isa. 6:5; 33:22; 43:15; 44:6; Jer. 46:18; 48:15, 51:57; the Enthrone- ment Psalms, etc. See also Hempel, op. cit., pp. 136 f.; Mowinckel, Psalmenstudien, Vol. II; Noth, Die israelitischen Personennamen im Rahmen der gemeinsemitischen Namengebung (1928), pp. 118 ff.; Buber, Das Kommende, Vol. I: K6nigtum Gottes (1932); Eichrodt, Theol. des Alten Testaments (1933), pp. 95 ff. 6 Cf.

To be included in the same picture is the conception of Yahweh as shepherd, for kings and rulers in the ancient East were often called the shepherds of their people.7 Yahweh as ruler was thought to have given to men his law, statutes, and commands (t6rdh, huqqim, misw6th). The prophets were mes- sengers of the ruler, as we know not merely because the name was applied to them in the Exilic and post-Exilic time but because they introduced their message with the words, "thus saith the Lord."' It is the duty of the servant, to whom the commands have been given, to pay heed, to be obedient. To obey, therefore, would surely be better than to sacrifice. And a "sinner" is primarily one who is disobedient and rebellious. The terminology of official Israelite theology, therefore, was largely determined by a certain social pattern, that of ruler-servant. Two other social patterns have intruded into what would otherwise be a fairly harmonious picture. The first, apparently introduced by Hosea, is the husband-wife relationship, wherein Israel is said to be an adulterous wife to Yahweh. In spite of attempts to the contrary no definite Canaanite background can be found for this unusual concep- tion, and its introduction may still best be explained as due to some peculiar marital (and/or emotional?) experience of Hosea. In any event, it is clear that the role of the husband in the ancient family is essentially that of master, and the picture is not entirely out of har- mony with the master-servant motive. In addition, whereas in Hosea's thought the divine husband loves the adulterous wife, Israel is not exhorted to love the husband but to be obedient to him-again, apparently, a mixture of motives, showing the intrusion of one upon the other and the accommodation of one to the other. The second social pattern which intrudes into the Israelite religious terminology is the father-son relationship. The primary interest of this paper is concerned with the question: Why was that conception comparatively rare? In the New Testament it is dominant; in the Old 7Gen. 48:15; Jer..31:10; Ezek. 34:2if., 12; Isa. 40:11; Zech. 11:17; Psalms 23:80; and 100. Cf. Hempel, op. cit., pp. 137 f.; Biblical Archaeologist, II, No. 4, 44 ff. 8 Cf. Isa. 6:8 (Isaiah thinks of himself as one who is sent); 42: 19; 44:26; Mal. 3: 1. See K6hler, op. cit., pp. 13 f. Fitting into the same picture is the etymology of the Hebrew word ndbWi as "one who is called (of God for a particular vocation)." See Albright, Journal of Bible and Religion, VIII, No. 3 (1940), 132 ff.</page><page sequence="4">THE TERMINOLOGY OF OLD TESTAMENT RELIGION 407 Testament it is sporadic and even then largely drained of its original connotations. Its earliest occurrence, apart from proper names, is in Exod. 4:22 (JE): "And thou shalt say to Pharaoh: 'Thus says Yahweh, My son, my first-born is Israel. And I said to you, Let my son go that he may serve me. But you refused to let him go!' " Even here it is to be noticed that there is a mixture of the father-son with the master- servant motive, as we may see in the use of the verb "to serve." Further references, only three of which are certainly to be dated in the eighth century, occasionally occur in the pre-Exilic prophets.' By the post-Exilic period the conception was apparently well known, as is shown by Mal. 1:6: "A son honors his father, and a servant his master; but, if I am a father, where is my honor, and if I am a master, where is my fear (or reverence)?" This verse clearly shows the two conceptions side by side, and the prophet is implying that the practical outcome of both should be a proper attitude toward God and obedi- ence to his will. The comparatively few references in the Old Testament to God's love for his people (the earliest being in Hosea) probably arise out or the father-son and, to some extent, out of the husband-wife motives."1 It is evidently for this reason that references to God's love are fairly infrequent. If the dominant conception of God is that of master or ruling lord, one would not expect to find references to the ruler's love but rather to his mercy, grace, long-suffering, and faithfulness to his promises and obligations (hese'd). That is just what we have.11 Many 9 Hos. 1:10 (post-Exilic?); 11:1; Isa. 1:2; 30:1, 9; Deut. 8:5; 14:1; Jer. 3:4 (gloss?) 3:14, 19-22 (where in the same verses there is a mixture with the husband-wife motive) 4:22; 31:9 (based on Exod. 4:22); and 31:20. See also Deut. 32:6, 19; Isa. 43:6; 45:11; 63:16; 64:8; Mal. 1:6; 2:10; Ps. 68:5; 82:6; 89:26; 103:13; Job 21:19. Cf. Hempel, op. cit., pp. 131 ff. 10 Hosea was apparently the first to introduce the word "love" in this connection: cf. Hos. 3:1; 9:15; 11:1-4; 14:4; Deut. 4:37; 7:8, 13; 10:15; 23:5; Jer. 31:3; Isa. 43:4; 63:9; Mal. 1:2; Zeph. 3:17. Cf. W. R. Smith, The Prophets, pp. 154ff.; Driver, Deu- teronomy, pp. 100-101. 11 Cf. the stereotyped sentence, "God is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and full of hes~d," in Exod. 34:6-7(J); II Chron. 30:9; Neh. 9:17, 31; Joel 2:13; Jonah 4:2; Ps. 86:15; 103:8; 145:8. God's mercy and grace are expressed by the verbs rdham and bdnan, by the noun ra46mim (only in the plural), and by the derived adjectives rahipm and hannan. The noun hbn appears only in secular usage and has no religious significance.

In none of the passages which employ the father-son picture does there remain any hint of a belief in a physical sonship.12 As Hempel has pointed out, the primary conception expressed in several of the verses is the thought of God as creator and ruling over the created: Is not he thy father who bought thee; did he not make thee and establish thee? [Deut. 32:6.] Is there not one father to us all; did not one God create us? [Mal. 2:10.] And now, Yahweh, thou art our father. We are the clay and thou art our potter; the work of thy hand are all of us. [Isa. 64:7.]13 These passages show the blending of the father-son picture with the creative and ruling aspect of Yahweh. They also show the organiza- tion of that terminology into the moral thought of the Israelite religion without any reference whatever to an actual physical rela- tionship between God as father and man as the son. Such an idea was entirely out of keeping with the official religion of Israel. Yet in the neighboring religions a belief in the physical relationship of the gods and men seems to have been prevalent. In Mesopotamia it was be- lieved that mankind was created from the blood of a god. According to Philo Byblius' description of Canaanite religion, the first men "sprang from the union of the east(?) wind with a female figure named Baau, probably the same word as Hebrew bohu, 'chaos.' "14 Jeremiah seems to have reference to a popular Canaanite belief when he refers to idolaters who say "to the tree you are my father, and to the stone you have borne me" (2:27). In any event it is an interesting fact that the father-son terminol- ogy is obviously intrusive into a scene otherwise dominated by the master-servant motive. It becomes fairly common only in the later period, from the seventh century on, precisely at the time when Canaanite influence on Israelite literature (as known from Ras 12 This is true even for those passages in which David (or the Davidic Messiah) is called a son of Yahweh: II Sam. 7:14 =I Chron. 17:13; 22:10; 28:6; Ps. 2:7; 89:26,27. 13 Cf. also Deut. 32:18 f. and Isa. 45:9-11.

It is likewise the period when the struggle for monotheism among Israelite thinkers had been largely won. It is a fair question, therefore, to ask whether the source of this intrusive terminology can be found, and whether there is a reason for its comparatively rare use in the official religious literature of Israel, especially in the pre- prophetic and early prophetic periods. The answers to these questions are to be found in a study of per- sonal names. After all, we have very little literature outside the Old Testament which describes the relationship conceived to exist between the gods and men. Most of the mythology describes the adventures and struggles of the gods or of some hero like Gilgamesh or Danel. Personal names, therefore, are our main source of evidence, and, in addition (as R. A. Bowman has suggested to me), they are always one of the most conservative elements in a culture. Among the divine names or titles used in Israelite personal names, an abbreviated form of Yahweh is, of course, the most common, fol- lowed closely in popularity by "El." Third in order, used about one- fifth as often as "Yahweh," is "father" ( &amp;b). Names compounded with adb were freely formed down to the tenth century. After that, new formations with this element were rare and probably became obsolete long before the Exile, the very period when the father-son terminology was well known.1" This is very significant, especially since such names continued in use among Phoenicians and Aramaeans long after their demise in Israel."6 Belonging to this class of names are such familiar examples as Abibaal ("my father is Baal"), Abimelech ("my father is king"), Abiel ("my father is El"),17 etc. Of special interest are the Israelite names Joab and Abijah,'8 meaning "Yahweh is a father" and 1~ Gray, Studies in Hebrew Proper Names, pp. 22 if. 16Ibid.; Noth, op. cit., pp. 66ff.; Harris, A Grammar of the Phoenician Language (1936), Glossary. 17 There is some doubt as to the translation of this type of name, the debate hinging around the yodh which may or may not follow the beth of db. It may be either a hireq compaginis (old genitive case ending-so Gray and Noth) or a pronominal suffix of the first person (so translated here). Whichever solution is adopted has little effect upon our argument, since the basic meaning is the same in both cases. The old translation "father of so-and-so" (so, e.g., W. R. Smith, Religion of the Semites2, p. 45, n. 2) is clearly wrong, since the name would have no meaning for the bearer. 18 Joab was the name of David's commander. Abijah was the name of the son and successor of Rehoboam (I Kings 14:31 if.), the second son of Samuel (I Sam. 8:2), a son</page><page sequence="7">410 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES "my father is Yahweh." Such names indicate that the conception of a god as father was common in Canaanite religion and that in the popular religion of Israel in the pre-prophetic period it was borrowed or carried over as a designation for Yahweh. There can be no doubt that the ultimate origin of the "father" names is to be traced back to the patriarchal, seminomadic society of the Semites in the second and third millenniums. In such a society the relationship between the clan or family and its deity was very close, and the family god was considered an actual member of the clan, being addressed as "father," "brother," or "kindred" (Iab, dh, and Cam. Personal names of this type, common among the Amorites during the early second millennium, appear as early as the Old Akkadian documents of the twenty-fifth to twenty-third centuries B.c.19 Thus the thought of Yahweh as the "father" of Israel is to be understood as a survival of the old tribal religion (cf., e.g., Isa. 63:16). Apart from the actual use of the term "father" are, however, other witnesses to the imprint of the older religion on Israel's theology, as in the requirement of absolute and unquestioned monolatry: Yahweh is Israel's God, and Israel is his people, Therewith Israel held fast to the personal and living conception of deity, so characteristic of tribal religion and so necessary for true morality. Thus the old religion of the patriarchal Semites exercised a most important influence upon the religion of Israel and made the development of an ethical mono- theism possible.20 Our primary question, however, still remains: if the old tribal religion had such a profound influence upon the religion of Israel, why was it that the old "father" and "brother" names rapidly went out of fashion in Israel after the tenth century, whereas they continued in use among the Canaanites and Aramaeans surrounding Palestine? And why, too, does the father-son terminology become well known only in a period when such names were practically nonexistent? The answer must lie in a peculiar, strong, and resistant quality of early Israelite of Jeroboam I (I Kings 14:1), the mother of Hezekiah (II Kings 18:2, II Chron. 29:1), and of other persons listed in Chronicles (I Chron. 2:24; 7:8; 24: 10) and Nehemiah (10:8; 12:4, 17 =I Chron. 24:10). 19 Albright, From the Stone Age to Christianity (1940), p. 185. 20 So Noth, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="8">THE TERMINOLOGY OF OLD TESTAMENT RELIGION 411 religion. At least this must have been the case on the part of leading religious leaders who reacted against something in the surrounding religions which was distasteful to them. Thus, even when the father- son motive came into use, it was drained of much of its earlier conno- tation and used to express the ideas of God as Creator and of his special relation to his chosen people. The question arises: why was the father-son idea distasteful to the religious leaders of early Israel? Apparently in the surrounding world the transition from nomadic to settled agricultural life brought a corresponding change in the conception of the tribal gods, so that they were altered to culture and nature deities.21 In this process the "fatherhood" of a god must have been conceived as more of a physical than a personal and ethical relationship. A hint that this is so is again to be found in the personal names. Before the first millennium, names signifying their bearers as the "son" or "daughter" of some god seem to have been rare, whereas they became increasingly popular there- after. From the tenth century on, the Aramaeans named their chil- dren "son of (god) Hadad" (Benhadad), a custom which grew in popularity and was especially prevalent among the pagans of Syria and Mesopotamia in the early Christian age, Barnabas (Bar-Nabu) and Barabbas (Bar-Rabba) being two well known examples.22 In Phoenician inscriptions appear the names "son of Baal" and "daugh- ter of Baal" and even a name meaning "my mother (or a mother) is Ashtart."'23 It is significant that no names of this type appear in Israel except as names of foreigners. Again we are reminded of Jeremiah's denunciation of idolaters who say "to the tree you are my father, and to the stone you have borne me" (2:27). This verse, together with the increasing prevalence of the names above mentioned, seems to point to a belief in an actual physical relationship between gods and men among Canaanites and Aramaeans. It was against such a conception that Israelite the- logians apparently reacted. 21 Ibid. 22 Albright, op. cit., pp. 187 and 327, n. 67. In the second reference his "eighth cen- tury" should be corrected to "tenth century." Note also the name Barkcls ("son of KIs" the Edomite god) in Ezra 2:53 = Neh. 7:55; and the early reference to Moabites as "sons" and "daughters" of Chemosh in Num. 21:29. 23 See Harris, op. cit., pp. 87 and 78. It should also be noted that the titles for El at Ras Shamra include "Father of Man" (Keret epic) and "Begetter of Creatures."</page><page sequence="9">412 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Here, then, we have another indication of the uniqueness and great- ness of Israelite religion as conceived by its leading exponents. In the polytheistic religions both the master-servant24 and the father-son motives were prevalent. In Israelite religion we have a conception of God which was new and different. Early in Israelite history the religion apparently was cast in a certain mold, or at least an impulse was given which was so strong and resistant that altered living condi- tions in Canaan failed to compromise it. The master-servant concep- tion was adopted, expanded, and united with the belief in the covenant bond between people and God, whereas the father-son motive was rejected. To be sure, the personal names bear witness to its popularity among the masses, but the prophetic reaction in the ninth century seems to have put a stop to it among pious Israelites, and it is im- portant to note that names meaning "son of God So-and-so" were never used. Even though Yahweh continued to be addressed as oAdonay, this Canaanite word was largely omitted from proper names after the tenth century, probably because of its associations with the Phoenician vegetation cult.25 Finally, when the prophets reintroduced the father-son picture, it was purified of its pagan connotations, but it was still clearly a foreign intrusion upon the otherwise dominant master-servant conception. It is also important to remember that, while it never is common in the literature, its most frequent use was precisely in the period of greatest Canaanite influence upon that litera- ture. This influence, however, was transformed while being absorbed, so that, while verbal and stylistic parallels abound, the theological content is quite different. How, where, and when did this new and strong theological struc- ture, employing only the master-servant motive to the exclusion of other social patterns, originate? Did it gradually come into being through thesis and antithesis or was it an original creation, purified through prophetic reaction? A careful study of the data so hastily surveyed in this paper leads one to the second alternative. In the 24 That this motive was present is well illustrated by personal names in which "king," "lord" (Iddon), "servant," "client" (bad) appear (see Harris, op. cit., Glossary, and Noth, op. cit., pp. 114 ff.). 25 Noth, op. cit., pp. 117 ff., and Gray ,op. cit., pp. 136 ff. The reaction against Baalism should also be noted in this connection; cf. Hosea's denunciation of Baal names among the people (2:17).</page><page sequence="10">THE TERMINOLOGY OF OLD TESTAMENT RELIGION 413 literature of the tenth and ninth centuries the structure is certainly present, and we are faced with the question: What religious leaders between the twelfth and tenth centuries were there in Israel who were capable of such an innovation? While Samuel, Nathan, or David may have had something to do with it, the probability (not, of course, abso- lute certainty) is that we must go back of the Period of the Judges into the formative days of the nation. While Israelite dependence upon Canaan is clear, it must not be forgotten that in the literature of the tenth and ninth centuries the differences are far more remarkable than the dependence. For one thing, the chief characteristic of polytheism is entirely absent. That is the personification of the various elements and powers in the universe. All things were apparently believed to have been created and controlled by Yahweh, and no one aspect of nature can be singled out as more characteristic of him than any other. Yahweh is pictured as standing alone, without wife or children, and "jealous" of the tendency toward personification. In fact, Yahweh's activity is not to be seen in mythology at all but rather in nature and history as the actual cause of events, and thus true mythology is virtually absent in Israel. Likewise remarkable is the prohibition against making an image of Yahweh. The antiquity of this prohibition is given some support by archeology-we can nowhere place our hands on a figure of Yahweh. Of course, one would immediately ask: How do we know whether a small male figure represents Yahweh or what? But the significant fact is that Canaanite cities possess quite a series of copper and bronze male figurines of a god, usually identified by archeologists with Baal. When we come to Israelite strata, however, the series gives out. Yet later Israelites were familiar with them, as we know from the de- nunciations in Deuteronomy, Jeremiah, Habakkuk, and Isaiah. In the city of Megiddo, for example, a tremendous amount of debris was moved from the first five town levels (all Israelite), and not a single example has been found as far as this writer is aware. Likewise unique in Israel, as compared with Canaan, are the moral tone of the religion with its apodictic legal tradition, the conception of the covenant relation between God and people, and the cosmological conceptions which show more dependence on Mesopotamian sources</page><page sequence="11">414 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES than on Canaanite. All these points are witness to the distinctiveness of the pre-eighth-century cultural and religious pattern in Israel; and, if this pattern is pre-prophetic, then the conclusion that it is Mosaic is difficult to avoid,26 though such a statement is centered in the realm of probabilities and inference and is not subject to absolute proof. By way of conclusion, a few remarks about the validity and im- portance of the anthropomorphic conceptions discussed may be in order. The husband-wife terminology certainly does not fit our own conception of Deity, though it was more congenial to the cultural and religious environment of Israel. Nevertheless, even there its survival was only a matter of some three hundred years; so we may take it that the conception was not compatible with the increasing emphasis on the individual. The father-son terminology, on the other hand, has been far more successful, and its great values were clearly pointed out by Jesus in the Parable of the Prodigal Son. It has been popular to contrast this picture with that of the more fear-inspiring Ruler of the Old Testament, to the detriment of the latter. Yet we must re- member that the father-son conception is in continual danger of de- generating into sentimentality, as has so often happened in modern times. It needs to be united with the master-servant picture to give it backbone and support. The Old Testament conception of the Rul- ing Lord who must be obeyed, attention to whose laws is a matter of life and death, is the very ground and source of the Christian belief in the necessity of obedience to the Divine Will. PRESBYTERIAN THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY CHICAGO 26 This is the position of Noth and, of course, of Albright. After conceiving the essential idea of this paper (the explanation of the comparative rarity of the father-son terminology as due to reaction to Canaanite religion), I found that Noth (op. cit., p. 143, n. 1) had come to essentially the same opinion, though he did not develop it.</page></plain_text>
