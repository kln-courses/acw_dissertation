<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERSPECTIVES Anthropology and the Politics of Representation Eddie Rodrigues John Game The concerns of an anthropology that seeks to go beyond the essentialisms of both colonial anthropology and liberal rights discourse, must of necessity begin by centralising the role of capitalist development in the oppression, and indeed the constitution, of such categories as 'indigenous peoples'. Such an analysis would draw out the manifold links between different forms of suffering imposed by capitalist development rather than pursue them in a segregated manner. In such a pursuit, anthropology must reframe its present political strategy in the study of culture. THEpresentcentury, and more specifically the period after the second world war, has been significant for non-western cultures for foregrounding the phenomenon of underdevelopment and the plight of marginalised peoples on to the world stage. Rapid modernisation has led to turbulence in these societies and regions, in which the weakest and poorest sections of society continue to face the most severe and relentless forms of exploitation, oppression and pauperisation. All over the underdeveloped world, tribal communities are victims of such oppression, resulting from both the market driven changes and the state sponsored development. It is also true that at different points of time their plight has been the object of attention by the western world, whether it was the isolationist policies of previous colonial governments, the proselytisation efforts of Christian missionaries, the ethno- graphic agenda of western anthropology, or in more recent times the developmenta- lism of post-colonial nation-states. In the last few decades the visibility of their plight has been further heightened by the expanding role of international institutions. Since the UN declaration of 1992 as the year of 'indigenous peoples', a diverse range of constituencies ranging from state and transnational institutions to environmental and social movement activists, to social and cultural anthropologists have been drawn towards intervening in, and theorising about, this category. One important reason for this resurgence of interest is due to the fact that, in a number of countries, most notably in Australia, Canada and Brazil, the economic and cultural claims of indigenous peoples have become a kind of logjam in the way of the larger developmental ambitions of states and markets at both national and international levels. The ensuing visibility of indigenous peoples in contemporary political discourse has resulted in this category playing an important role in a number of debates and arguments involving wider attempts by liberal theorists to extend the notion of 'rights' from individuals to communities. Within Left politics, attempts are also being niade to rethink the notion of 'de- velopment' and 'identity' in the aftermath of the perceived failure of Marxism to deal with these categories adequately. Further, many of these arguments have themselves become important components in the ideological arsenal of the struggles being waged by these exploited groups. Another feature of this same political scenario is the way in which these arguments have become imbricated in curious, often unremarked ways, with various kinds of horse-trading and tussles between national and international actors using apparently historical arguments to decide whether to allocate the status of 'original inhabitants' to particular groups, or using various apparently anthropological arguments about the utility of correct nomenclature. The resolution of these apparently theoretical arguments is therefore often more closely related to the arena of competing national and transnational interests than it is to the arena of disinterested academic enquiry. Thus the claims of UNO concerning indigenous peoples are often read as attempts by the west to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign nation-state whilst the claims of sovereignty are often read as simply attempts to evade the material costs ofjustice and equity. In this way both anthropology and indigenous peoples are subordianted to the logic of statecraft and realpolitik. It is against this political canvas that the discussions in the international workshop organised by the Canadian studies centre of the department of sociology, Poona University, must be placed. Entitled, 'Ecology, Survival and the First Nations - Issues of Comparison between Canada and India', the workshop sought to respond to three separate yet interrelated problem areas concerning indigenous peoples. Firstly, the problem of representing indigenous peoples, whether nationally or internationally, and the inherent tensions therein. Secondly, the problem of the survival of indigenous people, especially issues related to their control over natural resources. Thirdly, whether the indigenous peoples could provide for an alternative vision of human society (as in forms of knowledge, values, traditions, etc) preferably in opposition to the hegemonic model of capitalist development. An additional theme was to compare the present experience of the indigenous peoples in both Canada and India with a view to broadening the political contours of discussion on this subject. REPRESENTING INDIGENOUS PEOPLES From being subjects of the desultory interest of anthropologists to preserve 'a dying culture' for posterity, as well as constructing an 'other' against which the merits of progress and civilisation could be contrasted, the problem of indigenous peoples had unexpectedly metamorphosed into a subject of pressing contemporary concerns, both theoretical and political. All of this presages something of a crisis for the contemporary discipline of anthropology, increasingly self-conscious about the darker elements of its colonial past. The anthropomorphic constructions of culture rooted in the European enlightenment have been seen as instrumental in shaping not only the anthropological discourse in 19th century India, but also the attitudes and responses of colonial policy-makers/administrators in their dealings with India's tribal populations. The criminal tribes were presented as an example of such anthropomorphic construction and the inherent dangers of representation that Economic and Political Weekly October 17-24, 1998 2709</page><page sequence="2">such theoretical practices reveal. Even in thepost-independent period, it was argued, such practices of representation with varying degrees of modification and emphasis continued to characterise the practice of both agencies of state and mainstream academic anthropology. But what should the response of the newly self-conscious anthropology be when these same representations are utilised by these peoples themselves in their struggles with the state? In the Canadian context it was argued that the category of 'First Nations' [referring to the original inhabitants of Canada before the arrival of the European settlers] emerges as a viable cultural construction that aims to provide a rallying point for the political struggles of these original inhabitants. It was pointed out that the cultural category of 'First Nations' was influenced by the national liberation struggles of the 1960s and the critique of colonialism that these struggles generated. However, whilst the political and economic struggles of the First Nations simulated the language of the then current language of national liberation, their content was much more ambiguous, often reflecting demands for recognition and resources from the existing state rather then attempts to build a new one. One way of approaching this ambiguity at the conference was to argue that the First Nations represented a new form of nationalism in the era of globalisation which eschewed the project of state-building. It might be suggested that such a position ignores the way in which these movements are centred around the existence of the Canadian nation- state even if international forums might be used as a lever to extract resources from this state. Perhaps even more problematical from the stand-point of the politics of representation and anthropology was the role of the anthropologist who in no small measure has provided the cultural legitimacy for this category, by engaging in a cultural reconstruction of the customs and traditions of the First Nation peoples even if none of these are relevant to them today as they must have been in the distant past. The example provided of the Potlach ceremony amongst the Indians of the north-west coast is an excellent illustration of this engagement. Even though the last customary Potlach was conducted in 1929 and then too under a ban imposed by the Canadian state, the Potlach of today is neither a practice of tradition nor does it occupy the degree of centrality in the life of this society as it once did. On the contrary, the Potlach today is an anthropological reconstruction that not only denies the inevitability and complexity of the various historical forces that have acted on these north-west Indian communities since the early decades of this century, it is also unable to explain the declining role displayed by these communities today towards the once all important Potlach ceremony. Further, in the case of the Cree peoples in Canada, there is an even more illuminating illustration of the inherent tensions and contradiction in the category of the 'First Nations'. A combination of government sponsorships and the efforts of certain of these Cree peoples who had undergone training as anthropologists in the 1920s provided the raw material for shaping and sharpening of political and economic struggles around access to land (posed in terms of 'national liberation' of the wider category of 'First Nations'). This conflict was further sharpened by the fact that the land in question contained a hydro-electric dam that supplied the bulk of electric power to Quebec, the centre of Francophone separatist agitation. It was observed in this context that in the ensuing struggle not only did the Cree peoples engage in an anthropological reconstruction of customary lifestyles and traditions, but also that the Canadian state was the main provider of resources both economic and cultural to support this customary lifestyle of the Cree peoples given the fact that material conditions in the present made such a lifestyle of hunting and trapping impossible even if this dependency was often expressed in antagonistic forms. The way in which the cultural practices of these peoples increasingly functioned not as organic part of a way of life but as marks of a broader identity mobilised for instrumental purposes in the wider political universe can be seen in the increasing tension within these groups over whether they should focus on restoring 'traditional' relationship with the land in question and hence between themselves, or whether the strategic position of the land ought to be utilised in order to build up the economic and political strength of the community. These internal conflicts are in turn closely related to the emerging economic stratification of these co- mmunities as well as emerging divisions based on age and gender. The cultural construction of 'first nations' thus serves both as an instrument of mobilisation against the state and as a way of effacing emerging difficulties in reconciling that mobilisation with internal tensions. If anthropologists focus on questions of cultural identity, they risk collapsing these distinctions, but if they focus on the emerging stratification, they risk delegitimating movements for justice being wagedby communities whose deprivation is by no means purely the product of discursive manipulation. The theoretical difficulties involved were aptly brought out in a discussion of how these categories might be applied to 'tribals in India'. In the Indian context, it was argued that both the categories of 'tribal' as well as 'indigenous' pose severe conceptual and empirical difficulties in coming to terms with the contemporary situation of those social groups being referred to by these terms. The category of indigenous in the Indian context, unlike its Canadian parallel, begged the question, of how far back in time must one go in order to establish the indigenous claims of a given social group. Here it was pointed out that not only was the claim to indigenousness being made by social groups as in the case of the north-east invalid on the basis of the time at which they settled down in these geographical region, it was also noted that such regions were inhabited by other social groups much earlier then those claiming to be its originals inhabitants. Further, even if one were to use the criterion of geographical space to validate indigenousness, it was clearly pointed out that a given group while being indigenous in one geographical space, were certainly not in another. Thus, while the mundas of Chhota- nagpur can lay claim to being indigenous in that geographical space, the same claim certainly fails when it is made by the mundas in Assam. All this only goes to show how problematic this category can become if one accepts at face value notions of time and space to validate claims to being indigenous. Given its long history and civilisation, migrations and counter-migrations of social groups within the subcontinent has been going on for thousands of years, and there are those who will argue that such processes are still continuing. Further, processes of assimilation and acculturation that accompany such migrations have led to a situation in which it has become anthropologically difficult to distinguish what elements of culture are indigenous to a social group and what elements are later day developments. Such queries in recent times, it must be noted, have been essentially political and they follow a 2710 Economic and Political Weekly October 17-24, 1998</page><page sequence="3">logic of resolution quite apart from the concerns of the anthropologist. In this sense, unlike the First Nation category and its peculiar political trajectory in the Canadian context, the use of the 'indigenous' category becomes largely irrelevant in the Indian context. The category of 'tribal' has proved to be an even more problematic one given its colonial linkages within an- thropology. Early ethnographers, it was pointed out, were far from clear about the distinction between caste and tribe. Whereas colonial census sought to differentiate the two at first using the category of animism and later, the region, it has now become clear that such distinctions on the part of the colonial state were largely driven by political expediency. In the post-independent period, efforts of ethnography were directed at distinguishing between two different types of social organisation. Caste was seen as being regulated by the hereditary division of labour, hierarchy, based on purity and pollution, which in turn legitimised civic and religious disabilities forthe lower castes. The social organisation of tribes, however, was marked by an absence of such caste attributes. The category was defined essen- tially in terms of a societal type represen- ting a stage in socio-cultural evolution. The direction of this evolutionary change amongst tribal peoples came to be represented either as processes of cultural assimilation towards mainstream caste society or towards a process social differentiation and stratifica- tion resulting from modernisation and its allied processes as in the case of societies like the Oriyas or the Bengalis. In either case, it must be noticed that the post-independent nationalist agenda of tribal intergrationism not only completely obfuscated the need to substantially define the category, it also completely undermined in the name of backwardness, the way of life of these social groups, providing instead 'development', which it argued, would bring such groups out of their social, cultural and economic backwardness. Two things tend to get highlighted here, firstly, the way in which the category 'tribal' is used bythe government (and that includes the contribution of post-independent Indian anthropology as well) as a legal- administrative category within the sphere of development. Secondly, and as a result of the first, the use of this category by tribals as a basis for mobilisation and struggle against those whom they perceive as their oppressors and exploiters. It is therefore important to emphasise here, that the relevance of the tribal category is primarily located within the sphere of development. It is here that the category transcends the ethnographic concerns of mainstream anthropology, to become a political category within the largerpolitical discourse of social movements and struggles. The 'politics of representation' defined by such social movements involve notjust the way in which the state can use such representations against the people represented therein, but. also, how the peoples themselves use them against the hegemonic practices of the ruling classes. Despite decades of development, by the state's own admission, large sections of these social groups are still at the lowest end of the social and economic ladder. To make matters worse, development, in the name of progress, has carried out large- scale destruction of their material and cultural base, worsening present situation for many of them. Within such a context, it is the political concerns that must undoubtedly take precedence over the anthropological in dealing with the category of tribal. Yet having foregrounded the political in the consideration of these categories, the question remains about the extent to which such social movements and the identity politics they engage in are really capable of going beyond the confines of their particular struggles to the larger struggles for universal emancipation. The cultural constructions of 'first nations', 'indigenous' or 'tribals', it must be noted, are also identities distinguishing themselves from other struggles by other identities. To what extent can common ground be created between these identities and their struggles? To what extent can such identities and their struggles acknowledge the centrality of the modern social order and the changes that such an order demands both internally and ex- ternally'? The response to such pressing political issues appears to be bound up with important limitations in political strategies of such movements, which are based purely on questions of 'identity'. Thus, the category of First Nations combines both, an identity based on anthropological records of a 'dying culture', as well as with the struggles of tlose who refuse to accept that fate: Yet, it is very much a modern construction of identity. Anthropologists find themselves in a double-blind. If they seek to trace the way in which this identity is the product of modern historical forces, they find themselves undermining the basis for the political mobilisations of an undeniably oppressed and marginalised people. If, on the other hand, they take these cultural constructs as a starting point for an- thropological or cultural enquiry, they reproduce all the essentialist and reified representations of colonial anthropology and place identities like the 'First Nations' or 'Tribals' outside of history and social change. IDENTITY POLIMCS AND COMMUNITARIAN POLITICS The political dynamics of these social groups as they engage in identity politics within the larger sphere of socio-economic development was the focus of discussion in the second session of the workshop. The major issues which get represented in the movement of these social groups were clearly struggles for economic and cultural survival against both the developmentalism of the state, as well as exploitation by other vested interests groups. In the case of the Cree community of North Quebec, the manipulative role of the state forms an important component of the larger deal to get the Cree to give up their demands over the land on whose site was located the hydro-electric dam. In the case of the chakma tribals of Bangladesh, the consequences of being displaced by large- scale government sponsored development projects has generated a politics of rehabilitation, forcing the chakmas to take to militant action to protect their survival interests. In the case of the long-drawn struggles of the peoples of Uttara Kannada, what clearly emerges is the way in which in the name of forest management by both the colonial state and the post-independent state, forest policy resulted in generating a conflict of interest between the lo:al population and the forest department. The forests of North Kannada, in the name of development and backed by a state forest policy, became open to commercial exploi- tation by vested interests in the larger economy. Innumerable such instances dot the developmental . landscape of underdeveloped countries. Its victims are a vast and diverse range of social groups whether tribals, landless peasants, small farmers-or minority groups like dalits, etc. What is most unfortunate is that even though in most instances the oppressors continue to be the state and vested interest groups allied to it, the response of the oppressed has continued to trap itself in identity politics, very often sponsored by the state itself. The case of the Cree peoples of Canada is a case in point. Not only did the Canadian state provide the necessary Economic and Political Weekly October 17-24, 1998 2711</page><page sequence="4">recognition for the 'First Nations' identity of the Cree people, it also provided the necessary material resources for the Cree to engage in a lifestyle in keeping with this 'First Nation' identity. In yet another situation, identity politics saw two marginilised groups pitted against one another. In their struggle to protect their agricultural lands, from the rich non- tribal landlords of the North Godavari district ofAndhra Pradesh, the tribals have engaged in a number of strategies from the law courts to direct action. In the context of this struggle, the rich landlords were able to instigate the landless dalits against the tribals and what was initially a struggle between tribals and non-tribal landlords got deflected into a struggle between two marginalised groups, and even though both these groups are faced with similar issues of survival, in the strug- gle to protect their interests, the tribals see themselves distinctly different from the dalits. This important dilemma of identity politics, in which it is unable to transcend the limitations of its own identity, has been a major stumbling bloc for the tribal movement in the country. As a result, the movement becomes easy prey for all sorts of manipulative politics by the state and its ruling classes, either by putting one such movement against another, as is so evident in the case of the north-east groups, or, preventing the emergence of a broad- based struggle by emphasising theirunique identity, as is witnessed in recent struggles over displacement in the Narmada valley project. Within these social movements, there is now growing evidence to show that such social grouping are neither homogeneous entities nor are they, in the strict anthro- pological sense, rooted in their age old traditions and customs that once held the group together. In effect, their continuing engagements with mainstream society and the forces of modernisation has generated all sorts of differences - economic, social and political, within both the leadership and its support base. The acknowledgment of the emergence of a 'creamy layer' in such identity-based social movements (as for instance in the backward caste movement, dalit movement, etc) wherein a political elite within such struggles is actually able to appropriate the gains for itself raises the deeper question of the extent to which such movements can claim to be truly emancipatory for its followers. In this sense, it would not be wrong to argue that identity politics and the social movements linked up with such politics in the course of time reproduce those very same contradictions and tensions which in the first instance they claimed to be struggling against. Following in the vein of this discussion, the workshop sought to deal with yet another issue pertaining to the representation of such social movements. It was pointed out that 'community' provided yet another conceptual category i or understanding such social movements within the larger political space which shaped the contours of these movements. Here again the anthropological use of the term unerringly collides with its present political usage. Anthropologists have always used the term 'community' to refer to social groups marked by a hightened sense of bonding resulting from ties of blood, kin, language, religion, etc. The political connotation of community, on the other hand, is of farily recent origins undoubtedly resulting from the failures of existing forms of class politics on the one hand and the crisis of liberal models of individualism on the other. With political sponsorship and legitimacy coming from both state and non-state organisations, the term community has generally been used to refer to groups of people whose collective identity is constructed around a shared set of concerns which not only instrumentally defines their struggle, but also distinguishes it from other struggles, even if there exists deeper linkages amongst these different groups and their diverse struggles. Even more important to this instrumental construction of community in the political sense is the fact that unlike its anthropological counterpart that locates itself strictly within the domain of tradition and custom, the political construction of community is essentially a modern one located in the liberal political discourse of rights and the struggle for their attainment from a modern liberal state. Such a political conception of community not only precludes the possibility of any relevant structural analysis of such social formations, it is also often unable to deal with the range related tensions and inequa- lities that are an inherent part of the everyday lite practices and values of such political communities. Seen from an ideological standpoint, the growing visibility of the term community in social and political discourse of the past few decades, must be explained in the rise of a whole range of political movements based on ethnic and religious differences. Two lines of thinking emerged in this regard. While liberal theorists shifted their focus of concern from the terrain of the 'individual' towards the category of 'community', those influenced by Marxism took to an engagement with what came to be called the politics of 'identity' rather than the politics of social class. While these two developments had different points of origin and (at least intended) different destinations, the result was a growing pre-occupation with what might be called questions of cultural value rather than material interest. Both these developments however need to be placed in the much wider context of the political crisis of Marxism. The events of 1989 only served to underline a growing cynicism amongst activists not just about 'actually existing socialism' but also in the fact that existing forms of class politics and organisation proved to be both insenstive and unable to relate to the large number of struggles being waged by a diverse range of marginilised groups all over the world. A number of different radical movements thrown up by the turmoil of the 1960s had sought to distance themselves from the mainstream communist movement worldwide which was seen to duplicate the forms of state worship and forced accumulation as well as all the hierarchies and discontents which characterised capitalist development. If the 1960s and early 1970s had seen a 're-thinking' of Marxism which had done much to revita- lise the Left the much harsher climate of the 1980s saw an almost total evacuation of the whole terrain of Marxism both politically and theoretically. It is in this context that the politics of identity came to be seen not as a supplement of, but rather an alternative to Marxism. This has often led to a jargon which presents itself as 'anti-state', but is in fact, through the mediation of liberal rights discourse, as deeply implicated in statism as the old discredited Stalinism. ALTERNATIVE EPISTEMES The discussion of indigenous knowledge at the workshop was marked by the same kind of ambiguity between the anthro- pological and the political. It rapidly became clear that a discussion on the status of 'indigenous knowledge' could not simply be restricted to the kind of knowledge possessed by UNO's category of'indigenous peoples'. Discussions about the possibilities of 'indigenous knowledge' and its relation to the modem world have a long history in both anthropology and philosophy and have typically focused on the relationship between 'western' and 'non-western' forms of knowledge. As that contrast is itself the product of relatively recent history, these contrasts tend to focus on the respective merits of 2712 Economic and Political Weekly October 17-24, 1998</page><page sequence="5">modern scientific knowledge versus more traditional cosmologies. So, arguments present in terms of civilisational contrasts have their roots in the historical contrasts drawn by both exponents and critics of modernity within the general stream of enlightenment thought. Contemporary discussion are often vitiated by a lack of self-consciousness about how this historicity structures the entire argument. Nonetheless, it is clear that pre-colonial, non-western societies embraced a vast mix of different, often incommensurable cosmologies in different times and places and, importantly, in different social groups. These different forms of knowledge ranging from epistemologies closely associated with procuring the means of life to metaphysical constructs of the highest sophistication and complexity were treated by the main currents of enlightenment thought with varying degree's of condescension and con- tempt. What is the organising principle at work when we try to establish commonalties between often very diverse forms of non-western thought? In the case of this workshop the starting point was obviously provided by the arrogance'with which both the colonial and the post-colonial regimes treated the local knowledges of adivasis. The post- colonial period planners treated the supposed beneficiaries of the development process as objects rather than as conscious agents, ignoring not only the needs, but the knowledge of the local environment possessed by them. The results were often disastrous not only from the point of view of those dispossessed and displaced by development but from the point of view of the goal of development plans themselves. Local knowledges turned out to be not simply anachronistic survivals in the modern world, to be gradually rooted out by education and economic develop- ment, but essential inputs in any feasible plan to achieve these goals. The absence of any hermeneutic sympathy for what were perceived as only 'objects of develop- ment' often led, notj ust to untold suffering, but to ecological catastrophe. The result has been a certain chastened rethinking even in the official institutions concerned with development and a resulting plethora of books, articles, conferences, and univer- sity courses on 'indigenous technologies' around the world. It is clear that both the experiences of these disasters. and some of the institutional responses to the11m, have formed a resource upon which 'indigenous peoples' (gifted with a new nomenclature) and activists associated with them can draw in order to bolster their claimns for a more equitable distribution of both economic and political resources. But discussions raised at the conference implicitly raise questions about both the limits of such strategic use of the crisis of development institutions, and the limits of the category of 'indigenous knowledge' in this struggle. Often when the experience of 'indigenous peoples' is discussed in relation to the failures of development, there is an implicit assump- tion of a symmetry between the resources of indigenous knowledge and the scale of devastation wrought by modern forms of development. This symmetry is generated at the discursive level by contrlasting the allegedly symbiotic relationship with nature possessed by 'indigenous peoples' and the combative and domineering attitude to nature said to characterise 'western' modernity. Thus, the authentic and harmonious relationships with nature said to characterise, for instance, adivasi communities, are seen as a resource for more holistic models of development as opposed to the more 'one-sided' western models which lead to alienation, the destruction of culture, and ecological catastrophe. Thus, 'indigenous knowledge' is not only seen as more than a necessary empirical input into modern models of development, but instead, as argued by many at the conference, as an alternative 'episteme' which could provide solutions to the problems and discontents of modern societies. A number of papers attempted to build a bridge between the episteme's presented by indigenous forms of knowledge and post-enlightenment notions of emancipation ranging from eco-feminism to modern notions of egalitarianism to the very notion of 'development' itself. There were a number of tensions generated by these attempts which perhaps all revolve around the problems of anachronism that inevitably attach themselves to attempts to equate pre-modern forms of egalitarianism based on tradition with the modern forms which is based on quite different criteria. These tensions revolved around the position of women, the relation- ship between communities and social stratification as well as questions about the hierarchies of knowledge and organisation which inevitably accompany political mobilisation within modernity. The dangers of creating a body of 'NGO chiefs' was noted in this context in a particularly aserbic exchange. This problem of anachronism also attaches itself to attempts to equate 'indigenous knowledge' in a straightforward and linear way with modern ecological concerns. If by ecological catastrophe we mean irreversible damage to the planet then the modern age would appear to have a monopoly over that kind of capacity. If, however, by ecological catastrophe we mean the collapse of human cultures and societies as a result of our ignorance of the consequences of our necessary interventions in nature then modern societies have no such monopoly. Indeed recent historical research would indicate that premodern societies of all types were peculiarly vulnerable to such ecological catastrophes. The notion that human relationships with nature were uniformly harmonious in premodern societies or that normative attitudes like 'respect fornature' or even close working relationships with it, provided a guarantee against such catastroplics, has no historical warrant whatsoever. Rather the division between the natural and the unnatural, the authentic and the inauthentic upon which these contrasts are based appear to be solidly rooted in post-enlightenment critiques of modernity some of which, for instance the 'noble savage' paradigm, were to be re- tooled to play an invidious role in the essentialised and distorted picture of non- western peoples and their history presented by colonial anthropology. Modern environmental movements were however motivated by contemporary con- cerns about our environment, informed in part by growing modern scientific knowledg,e about our ecology as well as the experience of both modern and indigenous peoples of the catastrophic impact of certain models of development imposed on the world and its people. It is the self-consciousness generated by modernity itself as well as the experience of suffering imposed by it that orders our necessarily selective re-assessments of different forms of knowledge generated in different ti mes and places and too hastily rejected by the particular incarnation of modernity we are all imprisoned within: global capitalism. Thus, it is only if we reject t rof thtiit the jargo of authenticity that we can avoid charging these movements with anachronism and recognise their emancipatory content. To attempt the im- possible and develop a critique of modernity from outside of modernity is to cut the ground from under our feet and to leave us prey to the twin dangers of incorporation or political impotence. CONCLUSION This workshop demonstrated that political and theoretical questions posed by the experience and struggles of those Economic and Political Weekly October 17-24, 1998 2713</page><page sequence="6">designated as 'indigenous peoples' have no easy answer. But in allowing them to be posed it has played an important role. We would suggest that a necessary starting point for resolving these questions would be to recognise that if modernity has imposed terrible suffering, it has also generated internal critiques. These must not be abandoned but developed. Thus, anthropology can either carry on in the traditions of its colonial ancestry and continue to represent groups like the tribals and the First Nations peoples in terms of ahistorical cultural constructions, or, it can begin setting out a radical agenda, wherein the political struggles of marginilised groups become object of critical enquiry. Such a critical enquiry is in no way meant to undermine the political struggles of these social groups. On the contrary, it is aimed at shifting away the anthropological analysis of such identity- based social movements from an ongoing and questionable imbrication of emancipation with liberal rights discourse - an imbrication which often leads an- thropologists to unwittingly serve as co- nduits for ruling class politics and agendas. These process is related to the way in which globalisation and the regional instability which has accompanied it has led to the proliferation of new international institutions, rules, and organisations, which have attempted to fill the vacuum left behind by the destruction of the certainties of a bi-polar world. This unstable ideological situation has led many left wing anthropolgists and social scientists to view these new institutions and natworks as the site of possible contestation over official policies of development, environmentalism and, perhaps most centrally, human rights. The fact that, the rise of global institutions is a feature of the same global capitalist development that has marginalised the peoples under discussion appears not to be problematised in this context. The resulting paradox is that at a time when many radicals on the academic left appear to be pushing an agenda that is radically 'anti-state' and challenges received notions of development and progress, their language is infested with the 'officialese' of the official institutional and developmental jargon which has emerged to smooth over the contradictions of this 'progress' and 'development'. This situation has had an enormous impact on the ways in which the problems of 'indigenous peoples' (a catagory which is it self a category of this 'officialese') are posed and understood. The concerns of an anthropology that seeks to go beyond the essentialisms of both colonial anthropology and liberal rights discourse, must of necessity begin by centralising the role of capitalist development in the oppression, and indeed the Constitution, of such categories as 'indigenous peoples'. Such an analysis would draw out the links between the manifold and different forms of suffering imposed by the process of capitalist development rather than pursue the analytical segregation of such different forms of suffering as a pre-condition for their emancipation. If anthropologists must rethink their role in such struggles, their engagement must be in constructing the broad methodological and ideological ground wherein such social movements not only find their own individual space but also their broadercollective orientation for struggle against the state. In such a pursuit, anthropology itself must reframe its present political strategy in the study of culture. This is a huge and onerous task which confronts a number of serious theoretical and practical difficulties. But it is a vital and necessary one in the present historical juncture in which not only anthropology but other social sciences find themselves. BETWEEN TWO FIRES: Volume 2 Towards an Understanding of Jawaharlal Nehru's Foreign Policy Iqbal Singh As the Congress party's chief spokesperson on international affairs for two decades before Independence and as India's Foreign Minister for well over a decade and a half after it, Jawaharlal Nehru is, perhaps, the most authentic and convincing expositor of India's foreign policy. This is a meticulously researched and well documented two-volume study towards an understanding of Jawaharlal Nehru's foreign policy. Based on hitherto unused Nehru Papers the author addresses issues that have dodged students of Indian foreign policy and world diplomacy. 81 250 1585 X Rs 375.00 A LIFE OF OUR TIMES Rajeshwar Dayal Neither history nor autobiography, this unique first person narrative partakes of both as it yields a panoramic view of the best part of the twentieth century.
