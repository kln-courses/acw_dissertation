AND HIGH WYCOMBE</page><page sequence="3">INSCRIBED TO THE CONTRIBUTORS BY THE EDITOR</page><page sequence="4">PREFACE THE first volume of the Synoptic Inidex to the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society covered the years 1900 to 1949. All that was said in the opening paragraphs of the Preface to that volume remains true. For now well over half a century, the London Aristotelian Society has held its place as the forum and the main meeting-pomt of British philosophical thought. The present volume covers the period 1950 to 1959 inclusive, i.e., the ten years following the date at which the first volume closes. PART I SYNOPSES In this Part there appear, as before, in alphabetical order, the names of all contributors of papers read to the Society during the period. Under each contributor's name will be found, in italics, the titles of his papers in chronological order. They have been numbered for convenience of reference. Immediately below the title, there appears, in every case, a summary or synopsis of the paper-that "Synopsis of the argument" which gives its name to the Index. As before, the authors themselves have co-operated in the synopsising; a few simply endorsing the Editor's version, others amending before adopting, and the remainder-these being the great majority (amongst them such writers as A. J. Ayer, Sir Isaiah Berlin, C. D. Broad, A. C. Ewing, William Kneale, H. H. Price, W. V. Quine, John T. Wisdom-doing the whole of the work.' It remains the significant feature of the Synoptic Index that the great bulk of the Synopses, in both volumes, are by the Authors' own hands. PART II SUBJECTS In this Part, the title "Subjects" includes some proper names. Under any Subject, the references given are references back to Part I of this volume. On turning back the reader imediately finds where in the Proceedings the subject is treated. Always, Volume and Article are given; and frequently, in addition, the pages. A reader interested in a subject and consulting the Index, will often want to know, not only where the subject is discussed, but in what general context it is there being treated. A glance at the synopsis before him will always give him this. In this Part it will be noticed that I have added, as before, occasional "Points". These are points made by sundry writers-the ' Any synopses for which the Editor alone is responsible are marked with an asterisk. Except in one or two cases these concern, this time, only writers whose death occurred before the Index was completed. vii</page><page sequence="5">viii PREFACE places in the Proceedings, where they have made them, being given- a scheme which I think cannot fail to be useful, even if occasionally the question is provoked in the reader's mind, whether what I have here ventured to set down as a particular writer's point be indeed the very point which the writer had in view. Always, it is I who have set them down, not the Author. PART III NAMES This short Part is new to the Index with the present issue. In any period of thought such as these ten years, it cannot be without importance to see who, chiefly, have been discussing whom. Such information is what this Part aims to supply, so far as the Aristotelian Society is concerned. APPENDIX As before, this gives, in a bird's eye view, the Tables of Contents, covering the twenty volumes, in the order of their appearing. Throughout the preparation of the volume I have again been indebted for constant guidance and friendly advice to my old student and ex-colleague, W. Haas, now of the Department of General Linguistics at Manchester University. A brief word may be permitted, in conclusion, about the purpose of this work on which, with the Society's co-operation, I have been engaged. I of course trust and fully believe that its design makes the work capable of serving many purposes-as reference book, aid to historians of contemporary English thought, even perhaps something of a resource for practical teachers of Philosophy in search of thesis- sub jects and examination-questions. But I hope that these, its more obvious possibilities of usefulness, will still leave plain to all who read, that the book is also a student's book. It was at least-indeed it was chiefly-so intended. What all along I conceived myself to be designing was a book which a student would like to work in, with his teacher-a place where especially the Honours undergraduate might find suggestions, be prompted to ask questions, learn to recognize issues and assess writers, develop his own particular loyalties and antipathies; and thus-between the book whose pages he turned, and the teacher he talked to about them-be helped gradually to recognize who's who and what is what, in this exciting new field; and in the end, perhaps, find himself the better able to work his own slow way, out of initial bewilderment, to eventual decision, satisfaction and mastery. Of all the ways that a student could take, of making his entry upon-or, if you like, of gate- crashing into-the strange philosophical milieu of the present, I cannot think of any much better, than first to find what the dis- tinguished writers of these synopses have to say about what they have lately said; and then get into the volumes themselves and read it.</page><page sequence="6">PART I SYNOPSES</page><page sequence="7">AARON, R. I. 6 Dispensing with mind Vol. LII (1951-52) pp. 225-42 Synopsis: A The mind-body dualism an embarrassment, 225-6 B Can we dispense with 'mind' by substituting 'brain'? 226-9 C Sir Charles Sherrington's view 229-31 D Is the mind-body dualism a way of speaking only, with no real distinction involved? 231-3 E Some attempts to show that the distinction is relative and not absolute, 233-4 F Habit rather than intuition, as the key to thinking, 234-6 G But is an account of thinking in terms of habit adequate; and would it help in getting rid of the mind-body dualism? 236-8 H Anyhow, by examining sentences alone, the need for an absolute distinction is seen; for there are psi sentences and non-psi sentences, 238-42 7 Feeling sure, Suppl. XXX (1956), pp. 1-13 Synopsis: A Feeling sure, as an occurrence rather than a disposition. Varied uses of the phrase, 1-2 B Feeling sure is marked by complete absence of doubt. Is it knowing? A person can feel sure and yet not be knowing, 2-4 C Statement of the theory that, in order to know, (a) one must feel sure, (b) what one says is true must be true, and (c) the evidence taken to be conclusive must be conclusive. (This last assumes that there is evidence), 4-6 D Examination of this theory. No merely 'objective' test of feeling-sure, 6-9 E Two empirical facts (i) we do feel sure beyond a shadow of doubt, even though (ii) we may feel thus sure, when in error. The crux of the epistemological problem. We are fallible, and yet we feel sure. How is the paradox to be resolved? 9-13 8 The common sense view of sense perception, Vol. LVIII (1957-58), pp. 1-14 Synopsis: A Common-sense views of sense perception are in the ascendant. Do doubts still remain about their validity? 1 B Re-statement of the case for dualism, as opposed to the common-sense view, 2-4 C Support for dualism from physiologists and psychologists, 5 D The fundamental objection to dualism. (i) That it breeds scepticism. The common- sense case against such a theory. (ii) That dualism is itself objectionable, 6-9 E Some support for this from the analysis of sensation, and from certain psychological positions, 9-14 F Conclusion. A new stress on common-sense, in speculation about sense perception, is valuable; but a return to common-sense does not necessarily mean a return to naive realism. The task of the common-sense theory of sense perception may be to make its own form of realism compatible with the elements in dualism which it acknowledges to be true, whilst at the same time rejecting the central tenets of dualism, 14 ACTON, H. B. 5 Rights, Symposium (with J. Plamenatz and W. D. Lamont), Suppl. XXIV (1950), pp. 95-110 Synopsis: A The importance of defining political terms, 95-6 B Categorical social terms (e.g. freedom, consent, rights) are necessary for the description of any society other than primitive, 96 C Such terms are at several removes from sense experience; and thev are used loosely, so that definitions need to be assigned to them, 96-8 D Although these terms are evaluative, they are properly called descriptive as well, 98-100 E Defini- tion of political terms is of practical importance, 100-2 F Distinction between a dic- tionary definition of 'rights' (which may be circular) and a philosophical definition (which may refer to some irreducible notion), 102-4 G Positive and moral law, custom, the rules of games: all of these are rules; and rules are prescriptions, 104-7 H Acts of supererogation (and some cases of beneficence) show that not all duties presuppose correla- tive rights, 107-8 I Animals may have moral-and perhaps legal-rights, even though they have no duties, 108-10 6 The materialist conception of history, Vol. LII (1951-52), pp. 207-24 Synopsis: A Engels's statement that 'mankind must first of all eat and drink and have shelter and clothing, before it can pursue politics, science, religion, etc.'. The statement is either tautological; 207-9 B or platitudinous; 209-10 C or else Engels is sketching a speculative view of the early history of mankind, 210-12 D Marx's version of the materialist conception of history: that important changes in 'the productive forces' cause changes (a) in 'the productive relationships', (b) in 'the judicial and political superstructure', and (c) in 'ideologies', 213-14 E As to (a), important changes in productive forces just are changes in productive relationships, 214-5 F As to (b), although successful changes in productive forces presuppose that the necessary legal and political alterations have been secured; it cannot be foreseen that these alterations will in fact be secured, 215-18 G Dangers of using the word 'determine' in this context, 218-20 H The impossibility of making a clear distinction between 'basis' and 'superstructure' prevents Marx's view from being amenable to test, 220-1 I As to (c), Marx's theory of 'ideology' is based on his opposition to speculative philosophy, with which he links moral and political theory, 221-4 J If, as on the Marxist view, natural science is not ideological but is inseparable from technology, then it is already part of 'the basis', 224 3</page><page sequence="8">0 AKESSON Acton, H. B.-continued 7 Tradition and some other forms of order, Vol. LIII (1952-53), pp. 1-28 Synopsis: A Some connections and cross-connections between liberalism, collectivism and traditionalism, 1-2 B Characteristically, traditions are chronic, continuous and authori- tative; authoritativeness being the chief mark of them, 2-5 C The opposite of a tradi- tional society would be one which was deliberately organised and continually reviewed in the light of conscious aims, 5-8 D Liberalism is in lirno with traditionalism in opposing coercive change; but, as favouring the pursuit of scientific truth, it is opposed to tradi- tionalism, 9-10 E Liberalism favours free individual'change, 11-13 F Liberals are critical and anti-authoritarian, 13-14 G But, like traditionalists, they welcome some sorts of unwilled, unintended social occurrence and institution, 14 H An examination of the nature and variety of unintended social phenomena; and a proof of their necessity, 14-25 I A comparison between traditional moral standards and liberal moral standards, 25 J Liberalism, while presupposing natural law as setting a minimum standard of conduct, requires in addition a variety of competing positive standards, 26-8 AKESSON, E. 1 The analysis of deontic experience in Hdgerstrom's philosophy, Vol. LVII (1956-57), pp. 161-76 Synopsis: A Some introductory notes about the life and philosophy of the Swedish thinker Axel Hagerstrbm,1 161-2 B Interpretation and analysis of Hagerstrom's description of deontic experience ('the mental state of being under obligation to do a definite action') as given in his Inquiries into the nature of law and morals, translated by C. D. Broad (Upsala, 1953). The author stresses the resemblance between obeying ('the state of mind in which you receive and execute an order') and deontic experience. In both situations he finds (i) the idea of an action executed by the person himself, and, inseparably linked with it, a conative impulse; and (ii) a feeling of constraint. In obeying the linking-power, lies the imperative of the order-giver. In deontic experience there is no such peculiar relation between the person who says: 'I ought to do this' and the commanding person. In this case, the verbal expression thou shalt acts independently of a personal order-giver; and it has, in connexion with the idea of action, the power of evoking immediately a conative impulse, accompanied by a feeling of constraint. This whole 'mental state' is expressed in the indicative sentence 'I ought to do this'. Later, this indicative form suggests the false belief that the action has a peculiar predicate, right. This label has then the same power of evoking a conative impulse as the expression thou shalt. No valuation is involved in the deontic experience, 162-4 C Criticisms. (i) The grammatical form of an indicative sentence would seem to be dependent upon the fact that the expression 'I have to do this particular action' includes a problematic judgment about a future action, 164-5 D (ii) Hagerstrom's explanation of the fact that the deontic sentence expresses the particular action as the right action, is open to question, 165-7 E (iii) Hagerstrom rejects every theory which presupposes 'deontify- ing' characteristics. No real property of the action makes the action into one which ought to be done. Every action can, in any system of norms, be given the label right or the label wrong. The relation between (a) a peculiar class of actions, or an individual action belonging to that class, and, on the other side (b) the labelling of this as right, is made a purely factual and accidental relation, with the property of rightness made thus illusory; no arguing about right and wrong is possible, beyond or above the specific system of morality. If a person is influenced by different systems of moral rules, the result must be an internal conflict of duties; but from this standpoint there seems to be no rational means of resolving the conflict, 167-9 F Two omissions in Hagerstr6m's analysis of the deontic experience (a) the idea of a future possible action is connected with the idea of a claim upon myself; (b) I accept this particular claim. 'I have to do this' is the natural verbal expression for this acceptance. The specific conative feeling seems to be immediately evoked by the acceptance. When for various reasons it is difficult to accept the claim, the conative feeling will be a feeling of compulsion, otherwise not. Some further conditions which must also be fulfilled in order to have a full deontic experience. If this analysis is correct, the sentence "I ought to do this action" expresses: "I accept now the claim which is made on me to do this possible action". The claiming is a relation between an existing interest and my possible action. The acceptance is my answer to this claim, 169-71 G When I call the obliga- tory action the right action, I mean that the fulfilment of the interest which makes the claim upon me to do this action, is a value. This analysis (which is given as a critical alternative to Higerstrom's views) makes a resolution of the internal conflict of duties possible, 171-4 H It must be a result of Hagerstrdm's analysis, to stress the prohibitive, in moral education. It cannot present a motive for positive creative education, because no creation of values is possible, 174-6 Omit 'cf' and omit 'p.

Necessity of separating experiences which come by the five senses, from such experiences as thinking, anger and pain. No special kind of behaviour associated with the former, which are more closely involved in behaviour than the latter. Behaviouristic analysis paradoxical, 25-7 B Points made by Mr. Shearn in criticism of the argument from analogy (Proc. Arist. Soc., Vol. L). (i) The argument cannot be applied; for Russell's principle, set out in Human Knowledge, requires the knowledge that a bodily event is sufficient condition of an experience; and this knowledge I can never have; (ii) its supporters do not need it, since their belief is founded on faith, not reason, 28-30 C Shearn's view that the argument cannot be applied, is directed against a principle to which no supporter of the argument is committed, 30 D His argument criticised. (i) The hay-fever analogy compares the argument from cause to effect with one from effect to cause. (ii) He can show the argument from analogy to be unsatisfactory, only by assuming that the behaviouristic analysis is the only satisfactory one, 30-2 E The argument from analogy re-described in terms of necessary conditions, 32-4 F Russell's principle re-stated, to stress necessary condi- tions, 35-6 G Criticism of one ground for Shearn's objection that the argument from analogy is not needed, 36-8 H A second ground criticised, 38-42 I Wisdom's objection, that, even if the argument from analogy can be applied, it is misleading and cannot give the required conclusion. Wisdom's parallels, here, are themselves misleading. Bread and the signs of bread. Invisible measles-germs. Germs of some kind are observable; we postulate un-observable germs by analogy. Argument for other people's experiences has affinities with this, 42-5 J Wisdom's contention that the argument from analogy could only give the conclusion that I am peculiar in having experiences. This contention ignores the fact that (i) consideration of the similar origins of human beings strengthens the analogy and makes a comparison with artefacts misleading; and it ignores the fact that (ii) the peculiar and intimate relation between my experiences and my behaviour, may justify an unusual kind of inference, 45-6 2 Cause and cure in psychotherapy, Symposium (with A. Maclntyre), Suppl. XXIX (1955), pp. 25-42 Synopsis: A Some preliminary difficulties of approach. Absence of an agreed definition of psychotherapy. Differences between schools. Disputed clinical successes, 25-7 B Psychotherapy offers 'explanations' (of symptoms); and, as explanations, they function in at least three different ways, being (and claimed as justified by being) (i) therapeutically effica- cious, or (ii) helpful to the therapist, or (iii) scientifically explanatory (of how symptoms are formed and removed), 27-30 C Psychotherapy may be a science even though the therapist, during consultation, (i) may be no detached observer, (ii) may have very imperfect sets of rules to follow in his practice, (iii) may accept unverifiable hypotheses, and (iv) may often be concerned to discover the motives for, rather than the causes of, symptoms, 30-5 D Three questions; and a chief impediment to the answering of them, 35-7 E When a therapist removes a symptom, is it by revealing its cause to the patient? Some therapists work chiefly by revealing causes, others chiefly by disclosing motives; but it may be argued that different methods may serve the same end, namely, the causing of certain emotional or valuational changes, 37-8 F The place of explanations (of symptoms), in terms of causes which lie outside the consulting room, 38-9 G Equally whether the therapist has offered casual or other explanations (or no explanations at all) to his patient, it would appear that, where he is successful, he can be said to have caused a change (emotional or valua- tional) in him. The total course of events seems to be susceptible of scientific description and explanation, 39-42 AMBROSE, A. 1 On entailment and logical necessity, Vol. LVI (1955-56), pp. 241-58 Synopsis: A Two questions. Given that a proposition 'p' is necessary, does 'p' entail that 'p' is necessary? Can a necessary proposition be entailed by a contingent one? 241 B Treatment of these questions is possible apart from a formal system in which 'necessary' and 'entails' figure, 241-2 C The manner in which the questions are framed mis- leadingly suggests that decisive answers are possible, dictated by the usage of the terms. It will here be contended that arguments purporting to establish definitely one answer or the other, do in fact only provide good reasons for creating an answer where none exists, 242-3 D When Dr. Lewy says, in answer to the first question, that 'all brothers are male', cannot entail 'it is necessary that all brothers are male',-let us call the former proposition (B) and the latter (N)-his argument is that what counts in favour of (B), viz. the proposition (S) that 'all siblings are male', does not count in favour of (N), 243-6 E But this argument presupposes, unwarrantably, that a hypothetical accident of nature could support ('count in favour of') a necessary truth. This would be to classify (B) and (S) together, and make a stretched use of 'counts in favour of', 246-50 F One 5</page><page sequence="10">ANSCOMBE Anbrose, A.-continued could construct an analogue of Lewy's argument; and one could meet it, either by denying that (S) entails (B) or by arguing that (B) entails (N), independently of whether (S) entails (B). We could not accept the f9rmer alternative, else we would also, seemingly, have to deny that a contingent proposition 'p' entails 'p v - p'. There are difficulties in allowing, of any contingent proposition, that it entails a necessary one. Whether an entailment is said to hold, is not dictated by the usage of 'entails' and 'necessary', 250-3. G Two independent arguments for saying that (B) entails (N): (i) If necessity is internal to (B), then (N) is redundant, whence (B) entails (N). (ii) To deny that (B) entails (N) results in the contradictory conjunction '(B) and not-(N)', where the contradiction is recognized as existing between the members of the conjunction, by anyone understanding (B). Whence (B) entails (N), 253-5 H Can this argument 'be objected to, as holding only in the case of simple sentences, about which one can know, in understandin# them, that they express a priori propositions? But understanding of sentences expressmg a priori propositions differs, according as it occurs prior to proof, or subsequent to it. Proof gains one knowledge of the proposition expressed by a sentence, the necessarily true one or the impossible one; whereas, prior to proof, no propositiQn was entertained, 255-7 I Granting that '(S) entails (B)', involves admitting that it also entails (N) if (B) entails (N)-an unpalatable consequence which is nevertheless preferable to denying that (S) entails (B), or that (B) entails (N)-nothing in the established usage of 'entaIls' or 'necessary' either disqualifies or warrants, with certainty, an argument having this consequence. As to the conflicting positions concerning the relations of (S), (B) aiid (N), Lewy's position assumes acceptance of.a linguistic innovation-an extended use of 'counts in favour of'-which there seems no good reason to accept. There is warrant in usage for asserting that (B) entails (N), but any argument for the counter-assertion which rests on '(S) entails (B)', is not justified by usage, 257-8 ANSCOMBE, G. E. M. 1 The principle of individuation, Symposium (with J. Lukasiewicz and K. R. Popper), Suppl. XXVII (1953), pp. 83-96 Synopsis: A The sense of 'matter' that concerns me (one Aristotelian sense) is the sense in which e.g. the matter of two bronze halls Is different, 83 B The, neo-scholastic idea of something that' remains 'unchanged because it is what changes, is manifest nonsense and a misreading' of Aristotle, 83-4 ' C Aristotle's ided 'is that the same stuff (nothing added or subtracted) is now wine, now vlnegar, but that 'you cannot sensibly isk 'what, then, is it all the time?', 84--5 D Similarly, he holds that this' stuff is not, as'such, of a definite dimension or quality; nor yet, as such, not of that dimension or quality; it can assume a dimension or quality and then again tease to have it. Predications about 'this bit of stuff as such' are not 'predications aboiit a mysterious something that neither has attributes nor lacks them: cf "a chair, as such, is 'not 'upholstered' or 'not-upholstered'," 85-7 E This stuff may, for Aristotle, even lose its identity (cease to be an identifiable body, . o8e rL) as when 'milk is poured into the sea. "This identifiability of matter is what Aristotle means' by 'this inatter'taken universally', 87-9 F 'Mattet is in a way obvious, but form' is frightfully 'difficult'. Aristolle did not-get at matter as substance minus form, but rather defined form as substance minus'matter; his account of this subtraction is full of inconsistencies, 89-91 ' G 'Intelligible 'natter' does not mean the same as 'this matter taken universally'; but is an absutd and uieless 'explanation' of how, in geometry, congruent figures may yet be diffetent, 91-2 H Individuals have no definition except that of their kind. The difference between two individuals of'the same kind is a difference of matter, in the sense so far explained, 92-3 I This does not imply, nor did Aristotle hold, that the persistence of an individual through time involves constancy of matter in its make-up, 93-6 2 Intention, Vol. LVII (1956-57), pp. 321-32 Synopsis: A One might try defining intentional actions as actions to which the question 'why' is given application, in a sense of 'why' in which the answer, if positive, gives a reason for the acting, 321 B 'I jumped because something startled nm,'. The words which follow 'because', here, do not give.a reason for acting; but it is difficult to see why not; or why this 'action' was not an action, in the sense suggested by the phrase 'reason for acting', 321-2 C The type of cause mentioned in such an explanation may be conveniently labelled a 'mental cause'. (It is of the sort of causation, which is known to the subject without observation,-not, e.g., lil*e the position of his limbs), 322-3 D Mental causes of feelings must be distinguihe4 from the objects of the feelings. And mental causes of actionsare to be distingushed front the motives of the actions, even when what is in questiorxis,the motives as contrasted with the-intentions, 323-6 E Motives may be distinguished (i) as 'interpretative' ('se the action in this light') or (ii) as 'backward-looking', such as a motive of revenge, in which a concrete past event is mentioned 6</page><page sequence="11">ASHBY Anscombe, G. E. M.-continued as the reason for acting.. What distinguishes the latter from mental causes is the way in which, conceptually, the thought of good or harm is involved in them, 326-30 F But the distinction between reason and cause is not everywhere a sharp one, 330-2 3 Pretending, Symposium (with J. L. Austin), Suppl. XXXII (1958), pp. 279-94 Synopsis: A The distinction between mock-performances and real pretences, 279-80 B. Ryle's account of imagining is really an explication of it by comparison with mock- performances; not one in terms of pretence, 280-1 C Pretences come into philosophy mainly because the possibility of e.g. a pretence of anger, seems to force upon us the view that 'anger' is a term definable only-by private ostensive definition-a view that is never- theless absurd, 281-2 D Professor Austin's view of the 'essential features' of pretending. One defect in it, is that 'pretending' ought to be defined in terms of 'seeming'; and there cannot be essential features of seeming, any more than of falsehood or of identity, 282-3 E Both in the performance that is the pretence, and in the perfornmance that is pretended, the person who is said to pretend must be a principal. But it need not be a current personal-performance of his. A ling may as easily pretend to come to an agreement by getting an envoy to sign something, as by signing it himself, 283-4 F The rule of sequence-of-tenses, for pretending: if a man has acted in the past so that I may now think that he was, e.g., angry, I cannot be thereby justified in saying either that 'he was then pretending to be angry', or that 'he is now pretending to have been angry', 284 G There is no further special intention involved in pretending, 284-5 H 'Pretending to x', like 'seeming to x', can be profitably discussed only in the light of the special meaning of the verb, to x, 285 I In particular, 'pretending to be angry' must be elucidated via the concept 'angry', which involves (1) an object, (2) expressions, (3) feelings, (4) aims, 285-7 J It isa mistake to suppose, because a man can say 'I felt angry', that we can find out what anger is by finding out what he felt, 287-8 K Hence e.g. if we know that the 'angry' man knew that he was really making his 'victims' enjoy themselves, we can diagnose a pretence of anger, in face of a flawlessly-acted expression of anger, 288 L With sham pain it is quite otherwise, because real pain is only a feeling, 288-9 M For a burglar to 'pretend to be cleaning' the windows (when really spying through them) is not what it is claimed to be, an example of 'something's being pretended, which really is so'. The burglar is cleaning them. But. what he only protends -is, to be 'cleaning them' (sc., to be engaged -in cleaning them&gt; in a regular way. Professor Austin is here misled by his English idiom, 289-90 N The 'pretence' of young children and animals, is so called only by way of sympathetic projection: what helps this, is the advantage subserved by the 'pretence', 290-2 0 Pretending may be purposive or un-purposive, examples of the latter being playful or teasing pretence. Again it may be plain or un-plain-plain pretence being unrefiectively-known to be such by the pretenders. Much un-purposive pretending is un-plain, 292 P An illustration of hypocritical pretence. This involves (1) that something is said, the contradictory of which the speaker knows to be true, (2) that this knowledge is implicit, and that it would take a little thought to bring it to the front, (3) that what the speaker says is not a mere cliche; it is not pretence to use a cliche if you must know its content to be false, and (4) that he is calling upon his hearer to respect something, 293-4 Q Cynicism, in one sense-of the word is (what I call) a plain pretence of being hypocritical, 294 ASHBY, R. W. 1 Use and verification, Vol. LVI (1955-56), pp. 149-66 Synopsis: A Many philasophers say that to know the meaning of a word or sentence is to know how to -use it. correctly, and some suggest that the principle of verifiability is an outmoded theory of meaning. This raises two questions: (1) does knowing the descriptive use of a sentence necessarily involve being able to recognise, by having certain sense experiences, the circumstances in which the statement expressed by the sentence would be true? (2) Must every descriptive sentence be an empirical sentence, i.e. one which describes something that could in principle be experienced; 149-50 B Two versions of the verifiability theory are considered and rejected. The contentions most important for the subsequent argument are (1) to know what sensation a sentence (e.g. 'This is red') describes, is to have the ability to identify correctly sensations of the kind in question; it is not a necessary condition for having this ability that one should have had, or be able to have, a sensation of that kind; (2) the function of a rule governing the descriptive use of a word or sentence is not, primarily, to correlate the expression with something in the world, 150-6 C The thesis is advanced that a sentence is descriptively meaningful, if its use expresses a propositional attitude, and if there is a rule or practice governing which propositional -attitudes it correctly expresses. It is argued that a necessary condition for anyone having any propositional attitude is his readiness to behave in certain ways, and that the use of a sentence expresses such an attitude, if the use is part of the relevant pattern of behaviour. This is worked out in some detail for the attitude of belief, 156-62 7</page><page sequence="12">AUSTIN Ashby, R. W.-continued D Regarding the two questions set for consideration at the beginning, the first is answered in the negative on the ground of the contentions advanced in B, and the second is answered in the negative on the ground of the thesis advanced in C, 162-6 *AUSTIN, J. L. 3 Truth, Symposium (with P. F. Strawson and D. R. Cousin), Suppl. XXIV (1950), pp. 111-28 Synopsis: A There are many uses of 'true', 111 B But when we say that something is true, what is this something-always ? The answer here proposed, namely a statement (assertion), 112-15 C And when is a statement true? First, there must be words and a world. (The latter including all words, except those being used about it, in the sense in which they are being used.) There will also have to be (i) words conventionally referring to, and (ii) words conventionally descriptive of, the (situations, things, events, etc., of the) world. Then the statement will be true if the state of affairs to which it by convention refers, is of the type which the sentence expressing the statement, is conventionally used to describe, 115-16 D 'Fact that . . .' vis a vis 'statement that . . .'. How this apposition leads to some of the mistakes (i) of 'coherence' theories, and (ii) of 'corre- spondence' theories. That particular 'correspondence with the facts' which a true statement has, is in no way a mirroring or reproduction of them, 116-20 E If having said that S (S being a statement), I proceed to say " the statement 'that S' is true" the addition seems logically superfluous. Yet it is not. So far from merely repeating that S, it is doubtful if, here, I am so much as even repeating it, 120-2 F Similarly 'the statement that S is P is false' is not just 'S is not P' 122-3 G It is not logically-superfluous to say, in addition to making a certain statement, that it 'is true', any more that it would have been superfluous to say of it that it was vague, (exaggerated, bold etc.). Each attempts, more or less successfully, to express the relation of the words to the world, 123-5 H Not only are many 'statements' characterisable in this obviously not logically-superfluous way: those are often also thus characterisable, which are true or false, 125-7 I Even if to say that the statement 'that S' is true, be allowed to be more than merely to repeat that S, must we not still ask what more? The answer of Strawson, (that it may be something we do rather than say) considered, 127-8 4 How to talk, Vol. LIII (1952-53), pp. 227-46 Synopsis: A Our object:- to elucidate some of our ordinary language about speech-acts (as when we say, e.g., that we describe X as Y, or that we call X Y, or that we state that X is Y, as though suggesting that all of these are distinct acts), 227-30 B We use language to talk about the world. Consider a (simplified) model situation in which we do so. In this situation the world would consist of items; and, in our language, every word (except the 'is' and the 'a', in 'is a') either has reference-i.e. is an I(tem)-word; or it has sense-i.e. is a T(ype)-word; no word having both, 227-8 C By agreed con- vention (a) each item will have its own I-word (numeral, let it be), and (b) each item-type its own T-word, having a sense, 228-9 D Questions of metaphysical status (metaphysics of types, senses, items) not here to be raised, 229-30 E Assertion. We can now say what assertion, in this simplified situation, would be. It would be the linking up, by the assertive link 'is a', of an I-word having reference, with a T-word having sense. And it would be satisfactory, if the item to which the I-word is conventionally linked, is of a type naturally matching the conventionally-agreed sense of the T-word, 230-1 F In this situation, even if I correctly apprehend the item's type, I shall mislead, by my statement, if, in making it, I either use the wrong vocable in referring, or use a T-word with the wrong sense. In both cases alike I have either adopted a wrong set of linguistic rules, or failed to keep (satisfy) a right set which I have adopted, 231-2 G So far, in our simplified speech-situation, referring is only part of the speech act; and using a name-with-a-sense (naming) is only another part. But if, in ' X is a Y,' I am either identifying X or stating that it is a Y, each of these is my whole speech-act. I mis-refer or mis-name by using a wrong word. I mis-state or mis-identify by the whole sentence I use, 232-3 H In saying that 1 (this item) is an N (N = name-with-a-sense), i.e. in match- ing I's type with the sense of the name,-saying 'N fits I'-I may be saying (according to the direction of the fit) eithei what fits I, or what I fits; which two become four, when the changes of emphasis (available for indicating the onus of match) are made use of; I may then be saying either 'N fits I (placing 1) or 'N fits I' (instancing N) or 'I fits N' (stating this about I) or 'I fits N' (casting I as an N), 233-5 I Defence of this choice of terms, 235 J TIhe diagram, 235-8 K Misplacing v mis-stating. Here, we get the sense (the type of the item) 'wrong': there, we may have taken the sense correctly, only the name not, 237 L Mis-instancing v mis-referring, 237-8 M Further contrasts and similarities between these four varieties of the simplest speech-act, 238 8</page><page sequence="13">AUSTIN Austin, J. L.-continued N Rise of complexity in our talk about the world. How we treat a new item, say 1228, when there come to be more item-types in our world than names in our language. The recalcitrant 1228 (which, say, isn't anything in our language, as, say, 1227 is a 'rhombus') may be found to be (or zo be nearly) something else in our language; and thus be (i) identi- fied as (or rather, called) or (ii) stated to be (or rather, described as), or (iii) taken as instanc- ing (or rather, as exemplifying), or (iv) cast as (or rather, classified as), say, a polygon. In 'wrongly' saying that 1228 either is called a polygon or exemplifies 'polygon', we are violating language laws; whereas in 'wrongly' either describing it or classifying it, we do violene" to the facts, 239-41 0 The act of calling rather than identifying as, and of describi,sg as rather than stating to be, is often made easier by making some change in the laws-of-language which we have adopted, 242 P The case where the new item-type proves to be (or be equally-nearly) several of the available senses, 242-3 Q (i) Our names for speech-acts demand more study of the above kind than they have been given; and (ii) differences between them seem largely dependent on the model which is being implicitly used, 243-4 R Speech-acts, being differently-named, may be related to each other in one way when one model of the speech-situation is envisaged, and in another when another is envisaged; as will be shown if the aosertive link 'is a', in our model, be replaced by 'is not a', 244-6 5 A plea for excuses, Vol. LVII (1956-57), pp. 1-29 Synopsis: A When someone has done something in some way untoward, 'excuses' for him may be proffered-the occasion being when he is accused of it, 1-2 B When he is said to have done something in some way untoward; 2 C either we justify the deed, allowing that he did it, but maintaining that it was not untoward; or we excuse it, saying it was not merely by him that the untoward act was committed, 2-3 D Why study such excuses? Because of the need (for the effective study of moral philosophy) of establishing the usages of words, 3-4 E 'Doing an action' is very abstract; it is used as a stand-in for very much -for any personal subject (indeed for any subject at all) of a verb, with its verb, 4-5 F The kind of question we must ask, if we are to continue to use the expression 'doing an action' in philosophy, 5 G How the study of excuses helps. By studying how we speak of what needs excuse, we may get light on how we speak of the standard cases; so, perhaps, arriving at some articulate model of the machinery of acting, 5-6 H Why it is, that examining what-we-say-when is a useful method in philosophy, 7-9 I Supposed snags in such 'linguistic' philosophy. Is usage too loose to admit of our taking the study of it as our philosophical method? 10 J And is not the method, unavoidably, one of allowing the common man the last word in philosophical disputes? 11-12 K Some resources, by use of which the student investigating excuses may provide himself with material to investigate. The dictionary. The common law. Psychology, 12-15 L Some findings that issue from this study. (i) When the action expressed by a verb is the standard one, language does not admit adverbial modification of the verb. No modification, unless first some aberration, 15-16 M (ii) Our having to use a modifying expression in excusing an action, reveals the limits of the effective application of the expression, 16-17 N (iii) The importance of negations and opposites. Pleading (in excuse for it) that an act was done in a certain way, forces forward questions as to how it (apparently) was not done? These can be clarifying questions, 17-19 0 (iv) How the cluster of excusing adverbs reveals the use of our various terms descriptive of the internal machinery of an action; as, how we inform our- selves, plan, decide, execute, 19-20 P (v) How standards of the unacceptable come out, when we study excuses, 20-1 Q (vi) We may learn to dissociate adverbs thought in- compatible, and vice versa, 21 R (vii) Two morals to be drawn, from an instance of the language used by a judge and counsel, in trying a legal case, 21-3 S (viii) We can soon in the course of such a study, see 'small' distinctions in all their enormity: for example, between succumbings t temptation and loss of self-control, 23-4 T (ix) In excusing an act by using a phrase to describe the manner of it, the mere varying of the order of the words may constitute it a different usage, 24-5 U (x) A particular secondary use, which makes the adverb reveal the style of the action, 25-6 V (xi) We have to clarify what we are excusing, before deciding what would be an excuse, 26-7 W (xii) The need, when seeking the effective ordinary use of a word, to keep etymology in mind; and equally to remember the model behind the primitive usage. A further warning, important always in philosphy, against thinking that in all this we are seeking to map out some synthesis of models, 27-9 6 Pretending, Symposium (with G. E. M. Anscombe), Suppl. XXXII (1958), pp. 261-78 S.ynopsis: A If, in pretending to be A, you go too far, you are not pretending any more; but it does not follow that you are really being A, 261-5 B We also have the construction 'to pretend to be A-ing'. In this case, particularly when the action is 'physical', actually doing A may be incompatible with pretence, 265-6 C Is this always so? Examples show that it is not, 267-70 D The explanation of this is that the essential contrast is not between pretending and really being (or doing) but between the pretence-behaviour and the reality 9 B</page><page sequence="14">AYER Austin, J. L.-continued that it exists to conceal, 270-1 E Often, when we speak of 'pretending to A' we are emphasising the former contrast, and when we speak of 'pretending to be A-ing' we are emphasising the latter, 271 F Further features of pretending: (a) mere imitation is not pretence, for it does not imply dissembling, (b) a pretence must be distinctively like the genuine article, (c) typically, pretence is short-term and extempore, (d) the pretender must be present and active in person to effect the deception, 272-6 G 'Pretending that' vis-a-vis 'pretending to', 276-8 H Such importance as a study of pretending has is derived from the relevance of 'not exactly' doing certain things, to an understanding of doing those things, 278 AYER, A. J. 8 On what there is, Symposium (with P. T. Geach and W. V. Quine), Suppl. XXV (1951), pp. 137-48 Synopsis: A A summary of Quine's views on ontology. Quine holds that a sign may have meaning without there being anything which it denotes. In using such signs we need not be committed to asserting the existence of anything. Suppose that when we state that some- thing exists we use an existential quantifier. Then we admit into our ontology just those objects which are values of the variables that are bound by these quantifiers. The programme of nominalism is to say everything in such a way that only concrete entities are values of such variables, 137-8 B It is not clear, however, which propositions do have existential implications. Quine does not sufficiently distinguish between the cases in which one rejects an existential claim on empirical grounds and those in which it is rejected as a matter of principle: only the second class is philosophically interesting. A restatement of Quine's argument leads to the conclusion that if we use a predicate in such a way as to imply that it has an application we affirm the existence of anything that satisfies it. And he seems to hold that predicates always are so used unless they are formally eliminable, 138-41 C How- ever, Quine also says that physical objects can be treated as 'postulated entities' on a phenomenalist basis, even though physical predicates cannot be eliminated in favour of sensory predicates. But what then is the criterion for something's being a postulated entity? Quine gives none. It is suggested that a criterion may be found by defining a weak sense of 'reducible', calling a predicate basic with respect to a given language when the language contains no predicate to which it is reducible, and regarding talk about postulated entities as a way of saying that certain predicates are not basic, 141-3 D Quine attacks Geach for saying that 'red' when used predicatively stands for something. But Geach did not mean to imply that what such a predicate stands for is an abstract entity. Even if he did he could not be refuted. The most we could do would be to show that he was making an otiose assumption-that the use of predicates can be explained without it, 143-5 E This question of universals is unrewarding since nothing turns on it. But there are cases in which a disagreement about ontology reflects a disagreement about the validity of a certain class of statements. In philosophy the denial of being is the prelude to an explanation; the affirmation of being is more often a refusal to provide one, 145-7 F Quine is probably right, as against Geach, in saying that one's ontology is to some extent a matter of choice, but it is not clear what makes one choice better than another. And when Quine and Good- man renounced abstract entities were they regarding this only as a matter of convenience? 147-8 9 Statements about the past, Vol. LII (1951-52), pp. i-xx Synopsis: A Philosophical scepticism is distinguished by its generality. It calls standards of proof in question. For instance, it is suggested that we never have good reason to accept any statement about the past, i-ii B First stage of the sceptical argument, in this and other cases, is to show that the conclusion which is impugned goes beyond any possible evidence; the second stage is to argue that not only does the evidence not entail the con- clusion, it does not even support it. No accumulation of A's can confirm a B's existence, if the B's themselves are inaccessible, ii-iv .C One may attempt to meet this argument by denying the premises. To give oneself access to what is alleged to be inaccessible, one may either extend the evidence so that it comes to cover the conclusion, or reduce the conclusion to the level of the evidence, iv D In the case of the past, the second course results in the view that we can be directly acquainted with the past. But either this is contradictory or it comes down to no more than merely repeating the claim that certain statements about the past are true, iv-vii E It is impossible that any memory-experience should guarantee its own validity, vii-ix F One reason why philosophers have wished to hold that memory turns the past into the present, is that they see no other way to account for our having a notion of the past. But this notion can be derived from the relation of temporal precedence which is directly given in our experience, ix-xii G Refutation of Broad's argument that reduction of attributes of present, past and future to relations of precedence leaves out of account the transitory aspect of time, xii-xiv H The recession of events from future to past is only the reflection of a shift in the standpoint from which they 10</page><page sequence="15">AYER Ayer, A. J.-continued are viewed, xiv-xv I The mistake of identifying statements about the past with statements about present and future records. It is an abuse of the principle of verifiability, xv-xvii J Statements which differ only in tense do not differ in meaning. They merely give different indications of the temporal position of the speaker relatively to the event which he describes. And this could be made explicit in a further statement which could itself be tenseless, xvii-xix K It follows that there is no such thing as a class of statements about the past. Statements which happen to be about the past are not intrinsically unverifi- able, xix L Analogy on this point between statements about the past and statements about other minds, xix-xx M Nevertheless the sceptic can still maintain that we, being situated as we are, can have no good reason to believe any statement about the past or about another's mind. He makes his position secure by refusing to recognize as proof anything less than what is logicaly impossible, xx 10 Can there be a private language? Symposium (with R. Rhees), Suppl. XXVIII (1954), pp. 63-76 Synopsis: A No doubt there can be private languages, in the sense in which a language is private if only one person in fact understands it. But philosophers are concerned with the different question whether a language could be necessarily private, in the sense that only one person could understand it, 63-4 B Camap holds that sentences which were used to give a direct record of one's experiences would be private in this sense. They would not be in- telligible to others. Wittgenstein holds that they would not be intelligible even to oneself, 64-7 C Wittgenstein's ground for this is that the ascription of meaning to a sign is something that needs to be justified; and this means that there must be some independent test for determining that the sign is being use correctly: merely to check one private sensation by another would not be enough, 67-8 D But unless something can be recognized, no test can ever be completed, and in that case why should I not recognize my private sensa- tions? The problem of what it is to endow a sign with meaning seems to be independent of the question whether the object to which it refers is public or private, 68-9 E But I can point to a public object, whereas I can do no more than attend to a private one. What difference does this make? It is assumed first that it is logically impossible to understand a sign unless one can observe the object which it signifies, or at least observe something with which it is naturally associated, and secondly that for one to be able to attach meaning to a sign it is necessary that other people should be capable of understanding it too. But both these assumptions are false, 69-70 F To show that the second one is false, imagine an infant Robinson Crusoe devising a language for himself. There is no reason why he should not invent names for his private sensations as well as for the objects on the island. When Man Friday arrived he might not be able to teach him the meaning of the words which he had chosen to stand for his private sensations, but this would not imply that he himself attached no meaning to them, 70-2 G Besides, it is not logically impossible that Man Friday should learn their meaning. It is a contingent fact that we depend upon ostensive defini- tions in the way we do. Theoretically, Man Friday might just catch on to what Crusoe meant in these cases, even though he could not observe Crusoe's sensations. Thus, the first assumption is also false, 73-4 H If people have this sort of insight, we might be led to revise our concepts of publicity and privacy. What determines whether an object is public or private is whether or not it makes sense to say that two different people observe it. Tables are public: it makes sense to say that several people are perceiving the same table. Head- aches are private: it does not make sense to say that several people are feeling the same headache. But just as we can assimilate tables to headaches by talking in terms of sense- data, so we could assimilate headaches to tables by introducing a notation in which it was correct to speak of common headaches. Only, the conditions which would make this way of speaking useful happen not to obtain, 74-5 I As things are we do not have a use for such expressions as 'S, is feeling SI's thirst'. But the fact that it is made impossible for S, to share S,'s feelings in no way entails, as Carnap supposes, that S, cannot understand what S., says about them, 75-6 11 Phenomenology and linguistic analysis, Symposium (with C. Taylor), Suppl. XXXIII (1959), pp. 111-24 Synopsis: A The thesis of intentionality, as held by phenomenologists, is that consciousness is always consciousness of something. Inspection of these objects of consciousness is supposed to reveal their essences, the question of their ontological status being put aside. This thesis is obscurantist, inasmuch as it leaves the notion of an obiect of consciousness unanalysed, 111-12 B Mr. Taylor thinks that this original thesis has developed into the thesis that whatever is the object of consciousness has significance. This might only be a way of saying that intuitions without concepts are blind. But what Mr. Taylor seems to mean by it is that the objects of consciousness are all of the nature of signs: -and this is most implausible, 112-13 C Mr. Taylor, following Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenologie de la Perception, makes this thesis a ground for rejecting the sense-datum theory of percep- tion. Merleau-Ponty shows that the visual field has a structure, but this in itself is not an 11 B2</page><page sequence="16">BAlER Ayer, A. J.-continued objection to the sense-datum theory. His main argument is that our interpretation of our sense-experiences cannot be accounted for by the mechanism of association. But he does not succeed in proving this, 113-17 D Mr. Taylor's account of the pheno- menologist's idea of essences is not clear. He talks of our grasping a unity of significance but does not explain what this means. In his attack on what he calls the positivist theory he assumes first that analytic statements cannot be informative and secondly that definitions are wholly arbitrary. Both these assumptions are false, 117-19 E Logical positivists are not committed, as Mr. Taylor thinks, to holding that empirical concepts are learned by abstraction. In any case Mr. Taylor's attempt to refute abstractionism is unsuccessful. He quotes an argument of Mr. Geach's which purports to show that the concept of chromatic colour could not be acquired through abstraction: but the argument is fallacious, 119-21 F In so far as phenomenologists try to discover what is common to a given concept by seeing what is common to the situations to which it typically applies, they come very close in practice to the linguistic analysts. For this is the method employed both by Ryle in his Concept of mind and by Wittgenstein in his Philosophical investigations, though Wittgenstein would not have acknowledged that he was searching for essences. He regarded the assumption that there was an essence corresponding to every concept as a typical philosophers' mistake. What is relevant here is his method of catching concepts at work, 121-2 G Mr. Taylor is right in saying that neither phenomenology nor linguistic analysis is a philosophy without presuppositions. In addition to those he mentions, the phenomenologists make assumptions about the relation of consciousness to its objects and the linguistic analysts presuppose some form of the verification principle. A more serious criticism which can be made of both schools is that the mere description, whether it is said to be of essences or of the ordinary use of words, is not interesting unless it serves some theory or elucidates some puzzle. But here their practice tends to be better than their principles, 122-4 BAIER, K. 1 The ordinary use of words, Vol.4-LII (1951-52), pp. 47-70 Synopsis: A A tool has a use in virtue of its characteristics; a word, in virtue of the rules governing its use. Words put to uses for which they are not meant, like tools frequently mis-used, cease to be usable, 47-9 B Two senses of 'ordinary use': (i) 'as used by the majority'; (ii) 'typical or standard use'. Philosophers, like all normal adults, are qualified to say whether the use of a word is 'ordinary' in the second sense, 49-54 C To depart from a word's ordinary use is to violate some or all of the conditions of its ordinary use. This is sometimes necessary, as when we are confronted by wholly novel situations; sometimes it is even illuminating, as in metaphorical expressions, 54-7 D Philosophical theories are often stated in ways which amount to departures from the ordinary use of words. How this can be illuminating and how misleading, 57-9 E Philosophers depart from ordinary usage because they think that the ordinary use of words is arbitrary and often misleading, and that it can be improved, 59-60 F But, some words are such that any change in their use would involve a great many changes in the use of other words, if it is so to be, that language continues to function as before. In this sense such words are not arbitrary, 60-2 G It is true that the ordinary use of words is sometimes misleading, 62-3 H However, not all changes are an improvement. Eliminating one misleading use may involve the introduction of others even more misleading. It may be preferable to abide by the old use but point out in what ways it tends to mislead, 64-5 I The use of a word may be 'non-arbitrary' in a further sense. The current use, e.g. of 'colour', is superior to one which would make 'colour' analogous to 'sound'; for the present use gives priority to sight over hearing, and this represents accurately the relative importance of sight and hearing, 65-70 BARNES, W. H. F. 4 Talking about sensations, Vol. LIV (1953-54), pp. 261-78 Synopsis: A 'To feel' is used variously. Distinguish (i) I feel (I finger), e.g. the cloth; (ii) I feel (perceive), e.g. something against my leg; (iii) (as a sub-class of (ii)), I feel, e.g. my leg tremble (without touching it); (iv) I feel, e.g. an itch or a twinge, where the reference is to having the sensation; (v) another sense is where 'I feel' refers to having a sensation which is in fact caused by x, 261-5 B The difference between 'feel' a twinge (sensation) and 'feel' (perceive) a tweak is very clear, 265-6 C Some questions. (i) Do I observe my sensations ? No, if the word be used in the usual sense of 'see' or 'look at'; but we may perhaps notice them. For this word can cover both 'feel' (perceive) and 'feel' (sensation), 266-9 D (ii) Are my sensations private? Not literally. But- yes, by an appropriate metaphor; for I can tell you things about my sensations which you cannot notice yourself. Also vice-versa. Things literally private are like that, 269-70 E (iii) Is a sensation a thing? Does it exist? It is not an inanimate object, or a living thing; 12</page><page sequence="17">BEDFORD Barnes, W. H. F.-continued but there are such things as sensations, 270-1 F (iv) Are sensations mental? Are they in the mind, in consciousness? To say this of pain is a way of emphasising that it is not something 'in' my leg as the bone is 'in' it, but that it is somehow tied up with consciousness, 271-2 G (v) When having a sensation, do I know that I have it? There is, indeed, no getting to know or failing to get to know this; yet with regard to my sensations, I am like a person who knows, in this, namely, that I can tell others about them, 273-4 H (vi) Do I stop having a pain when I forget about it? I cease to notice it, though I do not cease to feel it, 274-6 I (vii) Are sensations spatial and temporal? Pain is felt in a place (in a part of the body) and for a time. But it takes up no space. It is not 'in' the body in that sense, 276 J Concluding remarks. Is the sensation of e.g. tingling in the finger just the blood rushing there, or is it something different? Here, no two things are happening, but only one. Sensation is involved in the 'inside story' of the happening, and to know what such a sensation is like, you must have one. It is not enough to observe the happening, 276-8 BASSON, A. H. 2 The logical status of supposition, Symposium (with D. F. Pears and B. Mayo), Suppl. XXV (1951), pp. 99-1 10 Synopsis: A What more a categorical proposition is, than a conjunction of hypotheticals. This, if anything, is at any rate not anything that is testable. Has it some further meaning that is not testable? 99 B Defence of the conception of the hypothetical as an assertion of real connexion between possibilities, 99-101 C Our feeling of the 'categorical force' in hypotheticals, vis d vis the next (the really serious) difficulty; namely, insufficiency of hypotheticals to provide the whole content of some categoricals. ('This is red', etc.), 101-10 D The phenomenalist analysis here threatens to extinguish the difference between dispositional predicates and non-dispositional, 102-3 E But does it? The distinction which is still open to the phenomenalist,-namely the distinction between what qualities are necessary to the existence of an object, and what are not, 103-6 F The phenomenalist thesis-that material objects are to sense-data, roughly, as natural laws are to such objects themselves. Why this ought not to suggest (what is fallacious) that to say of such an object that it exists, is to 'make a hypothesis about the behaviour of sense-data', 106-8 G The chief remaining difficulty of phenomenalism: that there are classes of apparently meaningful proposition-such, e.g. as assert sheer existence in an unlimited way-which it is unfit to interpret; at least, systematically. The lines of a possible defence, 108-10 3 Unsolvable problems, Vol. LVII (1956-57), pp. 269-80 Synopsis: A The paper registers an attempt to place Church's theorem in a more general philosophical context. By means of a diagonal argument, it is sought to show that no instructions expressible in the English language could enable one to decide, always, whether or not a sequence of letters constitutes instructions of a certain kind. Can it be claimed for Church's theorem (the theorem concerning a certain well-defined problem of number-theory, that it cannot be sclved by 'recursive means') that it sets-and in a way in which e.g. Locke's theory does not-a genuine limit to human capacity for understanding? 269-70 B Assumptions with which we here approach the question. 'Soluble' must mean soluble by a solution stateable in a human language, by words employing a finite alphabet, in messages not of infinite length. Truth of these assumptions, 270-1 C We suggest that there are problems stateable in (say) English, a solution to which can be shown not to be expressible in English.

It is also psychologically inadequate, 282-3 C The truth of emotion-statements (e.g. 'he is angry') does not require the existence of specific feelings. Being in an emotional state is logically prior to feeling so, 283-4 D This conclusion is consistent with our knowledge of our own and other people's emotions, 284-5 E The distinction between real and pretended emotions.

A. 0. Williams), Suppl. XXXIII (1959), pp. 73-92 Synopsis: A Being pleased by (or about) something, distinguished from finding something pleasant. This paper is concerned with the relation of pleasure to its objects (R) only in the former case, 73-4 B Two methods of pointing distinguished, 74-7 C Reasons why it is impossible to make a mistake by pointing to what does not exist. Williams' attempt indirectly to derive (R) from the notion of 'pointing to', therefore, breaks down, 77-9 D Differences between attending to something and having one's attention drawn by something. The latter is not a species of the former, 79-81 E Objections to Williams' thesis that (R) is 'the relation of attention to its objects'. In particular, this cannot be true where the object of pleasure is only mistakenly believed to exist (i.e. where there is no description of it that has a reference). For it is not possible to attend to, or to have one's attention drawn by, what does not exist in that sense, 81-4 F The connection between pleasure and belief. If someone is to be pleased by something he must believe (a) that it exists, (b) that it concerns him personally, (c) that it has such a character that he can approve of it in some respect, 85-6 G These beliefs, when formulated, are the reasons for being pleased. There is an analogy between these reasons and the reasons for action, 86-7 H This analogy suggests that (R) is the relation of activity to its objects. This thesis explained, with reference to fear and hope, 87-9 I Answer to the objection that pleasure does not always involve activity, 89-90 J The relation of an action to its object is of the right logical type to be identified with (R), 90-1 K (R), then, is a class of relations, not a specific relation. But this is an acceptable conclusion, 91-2 BEDNAROWSKI, W. 1 Hamilton's quantification of the predicate, Vol. LVI (1955-56), pp. 217-40 Synopsis: A The paper is roughly in three parts. In the first an attempt is made to find a tenable interpretation of Hamilton's logic by taking it as an everyday-language version of Euler's relations, i.e. extensional relations between terms (classes). In the second part the propositions of Euler and of Aristotle are compared and found to be inter-definable; every proposition of Aristotle can be defined by a disjunction of Euler's propositions, and every one of Euler's by a conjunction of Aristotle's. In the third part extensional interpretation is applied to the traditional logic. As a result, the nineteen traditional syllogisms are reduced to eleven, 217 B (I) Hamilton presented a system of logic built up of propositions in which both subject and predicate are quantified. His propositions are: All Y is all Z. All Y is some Z. Some Y is all Z. Some Y is some Z. No Y is any Z. No Y is some Z. Some Y is not any Z. Some Y is not some Z. The foregoing propositions state extensional relations between subjects and predicates, 217-18 C But there are too many of them. Sleszynski has shown that given two non-empty classes, S and P, there are only five possible relations between them, so far as having elements in common and not having common elements are concerned. These are the relations symbolised by Euler's circles. And Euler's relations are stated in the first five propositions of Hamilton. The last three propositions of Hamilton are meaningless, as there are no relations left to be stated by them, 218-22 D One can try, however, to regard the last three of Hamilton's propositions as: (i) alternative ways of stating some of Euler's relations; (ii) complementary ways of stating some of Euler's relations. But Hamilton did not regard them as comple- mentary ways of stating some of Euler's relations. And there is no need for any alternative ways of stating them either. Thus the last three propositions of Hamilton have to be rejected, 222-4 E In his system there are thirty-six syllogisms in each figure. Two remarks concerning this point. First, if Hamilton's statements state Euler's relations, syllogistic figures become pointless. Second, as only the first five propositions are meaningful, the total number of syllogisms is thirteen. And these are all that there are in the system, 224-7 F (II) Hamilton wanted to replace Aristotelian propositions by his own. As 14</page><page sequence="19">BENNETT Bednarowski, W.-continued there are only five meaningful Hamiltonian propositions, namely those which state Euler's relations, his recommendation would mean replacement of the language of Aristotle by that of Euler. These two languages are inter-definable, which means that whatever can be said in one of them can be said in the other. In the light of this, one aspect of the problem of the best language to choose, would seem to be statistical: it would be a question of which is the more economical, 227-32 G (III) If extensional interpretation is applied to the traditional logic, S e P becomes identical with P e S, and S i P with P i S. This is because from the extensional point of view, the same thing is stated, both by S e P and P e S, namely that there are no elements which are both S and P; and the same thing is stated both by S i P and P i S, namely that there are elements which are both S and P. Thus one has only six propositions in the traditional logic and not eight. In consequence there are only eleven valid syllogisms in that logic and not nineteen, 232-40 2 The law of excluded middle, Symposium (with P. T. Geach), Suppl. XXX (1956), pp. 74-90 Synopsis: A The law of excluded middle is here to be discussed together with the law of non-contradiction. Two interpretations to be considered, the ontological and the logical, 74 B (i) Ontologically interpreted, the two laws concern the relations between a given thing and a given attribute. The following formulations are suggested: If S is an object and P an attribute, it is impossible that S is P and that it is not P: law of non-contradiction. If S is an object and P an attribute, it is necessary either that S be P or that it be not P: law of excluded middle, 74-6 C (ii) Logically interpreted, both laws concern the relation between contradictory propositions with respect to possible distributions of truth- values. So, according to the law of non-contradiction, it is impossible for two contradictory propositions both to be true; while according to that of excluded middle it is impossible for two contradictory propositions both to be false, 76 D (i) Ontological interpretation. If one takes any object S and any attribute P, there are four possibilities: (a) Both S is P and S is not P; (b) S is P; (c) S is not P; (d) neither is S P nor is S not P. Aristotle seems to have wanted to eliminate possibilities (a) and (d); and to say, further, about possibilities (a) and (b), that one of the two, but only one, is the case. Taking p as an abbreviation for S is P, and - p as an abbreviation for S is not P; one can formulate the law of excluded middle as follows: Either p or , p ('Either . . . or . . .' being exclusive 'or'). If 'either p or not p' is the law of excluded middle, the law of non-contradiction is one of the eliminated possibilities, namely (a); and there does not seem to be any good reason for stating it as a separate law, 76-8 E In modem logic the law of excluded middle is stated as p v , p. Since 'v' stands for inclusive 'or', 'p v - p' does not eliminate the possibility that p and - p are both the case, 78-81 F (ii) Logical interpretation. Two statements have here to be dealt with: (I) that every proposition is either true or false; (II) that two contradictory propositions cannot both be false. Statement (I) can be understood in two ways. (a) As a definition of 'proposition' or (b) as something true about every proposition. In the latter case, whether every proposition is true or false depends on how 'true' and 'false' are defined, 81-2 G Three types of motive for its not being accepted (II) that every proposition is either true or false. The first (Fitch): there are propositions such that if one wants to attach a truth-value to them, one has to regard them as both true and false. For instance, the proposition: 'this proposition itself is false'. Since one does not want to have propositions which are both true and false, one decides, concerning these propositions, that they are neither, 82-3 H The second type of motive is represented by Spinoza, who defined truth in terms of knowledge, 83-8 I The third type is represented by intuitionism (Brouwer) who seems to believe, with Spinoza, that the true is only that which is known; but intuitionists seem to differ from Spinoza in maintaining that only what is known (i.e. what is constructed or proved) exists, 83-8 J Now the statement that every proposition is either true or false is not the principle of excluded middle. It is the principle of bi-valence. The principle of excluded middle declares, of two contradictory propositions, that they cannot be both false. Thus the rejection of the statement that every proposition is either true or false is the rejection of two-valued logic; it is not a rejection of the law of excluded middle, 81-90 BENNETT, J. 1 Analytic-synthetic, Vol. LIX (1958-59), pp. 163-88 Synopsis: A The paper aims to show that Quine's views on the analytic-synthetic distinction still require attacking, and to provide an attack, 163-4 B Quine's writings give the basis for a theory of the ASD (Analytic-synthetic distinction) in which the ASD marks a difference in degree only; this theory is non-question-beggging in the sense that it can be understood without prior understanding of any intensional terminology, 164-9 C It can be defended against many criticisms advanced by the traditional theorists, 169-74 D And the latter's attempted counter-theories are sometimes question-begging. This applies to attempts based on the distinction between conceptual and factual revision; 174-6 E on 15</page><page sequence="20">BERLIN Bennett, J.-continued the notion of impossibility-of-falisfication; 176-7 F on the notion of truth-by-virtue-of- word-usage-only; 177-8 G and on the notion, introduced by Grice and Strawson, of the distinction between (i) that the denial of which produces disbelief and (ii) that the denial of which produces sheer bewilderment, 178-80 H The Quinean theory false, as involving an unacceptable regress of 'sentences already accepted'. Its analogy to Lewis Carroll's Achilles-and-the-tortoise puzzle, 180-2 I Two plausible ways out of this difficulty only serve to create new difficulties, 182-5 J This defect in the Quinean theorv indicates where the traditionalist should try to break into the circle of intensional terms, viz. through the notion of sentences' being used as rules of inference rather than as premises, 185-8 BERLIN, I. (Sir Isaah Berlin) 3 Logical translation, Vol. L (1949-50), pp. 157-88 Synopsis: A Indication of (i) doctrines of truth and meaning of the general type emanating largely from the work of Russell and (ii) doctrines influenced by the correspondence theory of language, the basic fallacy underlying which it is the purpose of this paper to disclose, 157-8 B The chief way in which the fallacy manifests itself-the desire to translate propositions of many types into propositions of one particular type, 158-61 C The reason for choosing singular categorical propositions as the type which is, in this way, set up as model or logical ideal. It is a particular doctrine of how symbols mean. Consideration of the resulting puzzle-viz. how to deal with the many ways in which symbols do seem to mean, and which is not prima facie identical with the one single way in which, according to this doctrine, they are all supposed to mean, 161-2 D Two ways of solving this puzzle: (i) the 'deflationary' method, that of 'reducing' the recalcitrant sentences to the privileged or 'good' ones. This involves identification of the qualities required of a 'good' sentence, on the assumption that sentences other than the 'good' ones can only be salvaged to the degree to which they can be shown to possess elements which they share in common with the 'good' ones. The residue is to be disposed of somehow-to be shown not to perform the function of 'meaning' which symbols are supposed to perform, 162-4 E The paradox of the 'deflationary' method, is that a great many sentences which obviously do possess a meaning, cannot be allowed to do so within the schema, 164-8 F The other solution is (ii) the 'inflationary' method, which provides 'objects' (of different types or 'status') for all the multitudes of 'unprivileged' sentences, i.e. propositions other than singular categorical ones, to which they are then assumed to have the same relation as 'facts' of a normal kind have to the 'privileged' ones. This leads to a vast multiplication of types of entity in the world and suffers from an opposite defect to that of the 'deflationary' theory, namely that no sentences can now be excluded; and the world becomes populated by a fantastic variety of mythological entities, obviously invented to save an unsatisfactory theory, 168-72 G One fundamental fallacy common to both these desperate remedies ('either singular categoricals or not propositions'). This is the supposition that there exist 'basic' propositions-the ultimate entities to which it is hoped to reduce every- thing-'basic', or 'simple' or 'sense-datum' or 'atomic' propositions, 'protocols', etc., all of which spring from the belief that language or symbols function in only one way; and that all apparent deviations from this can, with sufficient skill, be 'reduced' to this single relationship with which the function of meaning can be identified; the relationship, the abandonment of which it is, that opens the door to endless aberrations, senseless use of symbols, metaphysics and general chaos, 172-80 H The source of this desire (for analysing all descriptive uses of language in terms of one basic use, and all the ingredients of the universe in terms of one basic entity) which leads to logical atomism and phenomenalism: it seems to arise from three distinct and equally fatal tendencies, 180 I (a) The correspondence-theory of language, which automatically renders the greater part of significant sentences meaningless and then has to resort to unplausible expedients to save them, 180-2 J (b) The Ionian fallacy, i.e. that of asking what 'everything' consists of. and of applying concepts which necessarily apply only to parts of the universe to the whole universe, which leads to absurdities, 182-4 K (c) The quest for certaintv and security, by which philosophers from Descartes, Locke and Berkeley, to Russell and his disciples, have been led to try and avoid error, vagueness and uncertainty by whittling sentences until they assert as little as possible, for fear of saying something which may be false. But even this attempt, to purchase incorrigibility at the expense of saying as little as possible, is in principle illusory; for to assert anything significant is automatically to render oneself liable to error. The less said the smaller the risk, but risk can never be avoided entirely, save at the cost of literally saying nothing at all, and confining oneself to vacuous tautologies, 184-6 L The epistemological problems which have led to the connected fallacies of inflation and deflation (the desire to reduce 'irreducible' distinctions to a single type) are genuine enough; but in this case the remedy has bred a metaphysics far more fantastic than any which it promised to exorcise, and is therefore a great deal worse than the disease, 186-8 16</page><page sequence="21">BERLIN Berlin, I.-continued 4 Equality, Symposium (with R. Wollheim), Vol. LVI (1955-56), pp. 301-26 Synopsis: A Preamble. 'Everyone to count for one and no-one for more than one' is the heart of the doctrine ot equal rights. The formula is vague, ambiguous, neither self-evident nor universally believed; and it depends neither on the doctrine of natural rights, nor on that of positive rights, since it could be held for purely utilitarian reasons; nor is it imposed by the arbitrary will of a sovereign. Equality has been closely connected with belief in human rights, and is historically and psychologically intertwined with that belief, but does not logically entail it. For this reason it may be useful to inspect it apart from its normal historical and psychological setting, 301-2 B Egalitarianism is a specific application of the principle that similar cases should be accorded similar treatment. This in practice means that uniform treatment should occur, in those aspects of life which deeply matter to individuals. This is tantamount to saying that it is 'natural' or 'rational' to treat every member of a given class as one treats any member of it, and 'unnatural' or 'irrational' to break this rule. This formula can easily be reduced to nullity by (a) accounting for all cases of unequal treatment by citing special circumstances to justify this; and (b) by representing unequal treatment of members of any class, as being equal treatment of them, when viewed as members of some class. Such reductiones ad absurdum can only be avoided by making clear what considerations are relevant in each case; and this will itself depend on differences of value and purpose on the part of individuals or groups, which will in turn depend on unpredictable differences of situation. The method of the application of general principles to given situations, can thus never in principle be exhaustively provided or justified, 302-4 C This position comes to saying that where there is equality of treatment, no reason need be given for this; for it is 'natural' or self-justifying. Only inequality calls for justification. If I divide a cake among ten persons, to give each one-tenth is 'self-evidently' right; and needs no defending; only other ratios of distribution call for special reasons. This is the notion of equality as intrinsically rational or intrinsically just. This acceptance of the canons of uniformity, regularity, similarity, symmetry as eis ipsis superior to their opposites, rests upon two further notions, namely those of rules as such, and of equality as an end desirable in itself, 304-S5 D All rules, as such, entail equality. To enforce a rule is to promote equality of behaviour or treatment. This is true of moral, legal, religious, political rules, rules of teams, clubs, etc. It follows simply from the proposition that rules do not allow of exceptions. So far as rules are necessary for the survival of any society, the equality entailed by them is co-extensive with social morality as such, i.e. with the existence of any system of social behaviour. Rationality is then identified with a minimum degree of consistency of behaviour required by any human association. Social morality may then be conceived as an interrelated network of mutually consistent rules. I may then be able to criticise such a political or moral system on at least three grounds. I may say: (a) that the rules are broken for no sufficient reason, i.e. exceptions are protested against as such, equality demanded for its own sake; or (b) that the rules concerned are bad because they are in conflict with other rules aimed at producing greater equality; or (c) that the rules are deplorable because they are rules, i.. because they promote the ideal of social equality, which is deplored as such. This is a direct attack on equality as a way of life, 305-11 E What is an egalitarian society ? A wholly egalitarian society is one in which dissimilarity is reduced to a minimum. A society can be condemned for inequality because, in it, some are richer or stronger or freer or more famous than, or are in some other way markedly different from, others. This may derive from belief in natural rights. Alternatively, such condemnation may take the form of regarding all inequalities as irrational. Theoretically this last may extend not merely to inequalities of wealth or power, but to the existence of any form of authority, say that of the conductor of an orchestra. A pure egalitarian wants a society in which any differences which may tend to produce inequalities, are removed. He will prefer a society in which men are as similar as possible, physically, mentally, emotionally, etc. It may be thought that such a society is in practice unrealisable; or that violently tyrannical measures would be necessary to bring it about. But this is not relevant to the concept itself. Such extreme equality-the maximum similarity of a body of all-but-indiscernible human beings-may never have been put forward as a serious ideal; but those parts of equality that have in fact been demanded are specific modifications of this idealised model, which for this reason is of central importance, 311-15 F Such modifications are-(a) orthodox liberal doctrines according to which, provided that men are (a) equal before the law, and (b) governed (in some sense) bv their common consent, and (c) posses a minimum of civil liberties protected by the principle 'one man one vote', no further interference (say economic) should be permitted. It is plain that to insist upon such initial political or legal equality is to be influenced by ideals other than mere equality. Even such an egalistician as Condorcet thinks that enlightened government can be secured only by elites armed with greater power than the governed. Elites are justified by the need, not for equality, but for creating a society in which certain other ends can be attained-e.g. happiness, virtue, justice, progress in the 17</page><page sequence="22">BLACK Berlin, I.-continued arts and sciences, etc. Condorcet supposes all these things to be compatible and indeed interconnected. The fallacy here, and its springs, 315-19 G It seems to follow that equality is merely one end among many, an ultimate principle whose compatability with other equally ultimate principles cannot be guaranteed, but will depend on the concrete situation. The demand for equality often takes the form of a belief in 'fairness'. Equality and fairness are closely bound up. Fairness is defined negatively as not breaking a rule, where the advantage of so doing depends on its being kept by others. Examples of cases where fairness is not compatible with maximum social happiness and other values. Desire to be fair is connected with moral sensitiveness, of which one of the criteria is liability to qualms of conscience at the prospect of certain types of action. Fairness, with equality, emerges as an end in itself, whose claim may, in a given situation, be rejected or reduced in favour of the claims of wholly different ends or visions of life. We choose as we choose, because one solution seems to us to embody a blend of satisfaction of claims and desires which we prefer as a total pattern to the blend provided by some other solution. Into such blends, versions of equality, equity, fairness, etc. enter in various not easily analysable, nor exhaustively classifiable, ways, 319-24 H Examination of those who regard equality neither as one among many ends nor as an ultimate goal, but as intrinsically undesirable, since they oppose all rules as such, and desire an unsystematic society, ruled by the arbitrary will of an inspired leader, or the unpredictable movement of the 'spirit' of a nation, race, party or church. Such anti-egalitarianism is not as rare as some liberals and socialists assume, or as unsuccessful in its conflicts with the traditional western principles of equality, justice, natural rights, and a minimum of civil liberties. Belief in equality is a deep-rooted principle in human thought, but the notion that it is as self-evident to all sane men as that 'red is different from blue'-which the defenders of 'natural law' (and Locke at times) hold,-is incorrect, as the subsequent career of egalitarianism has shewn. As for extreme egalitarianism, which requires the minimisation of all distinctions between men, and the maximization of assimilation and uniformity,-this ideal is not prominent in the majority of actual political doctrines, largely because it conflicts with other equally ultimate ideals. Most of the influential ethical and political views seem to be forms of compromise between principles which, in their 'pure' form, cannot co-exist, 324-6 I In conclusion equality is one of the oldest and deepest elements in liberal thought, and, like other human ends, cannot be defended or justified, for it is itself what justifies other acts. Equality is neither more nor less 'natural' or 'rational' than any other element which enters into ends which men pursue for their own sakes. Many policies and views of life, not obviously connected with equality, have (in fact) been surreptitiously smuggled in under its cover, in order to share in its prestige. But to isolate the pure ore of egalitarianism proper, from those alloys which the admixture of other attitudes and ideals has at various times generated, is a task for the historian of ideas and outside the purpose of this discussion, 326 BLACK, M. 4 Metaphor, Vol. LV (1954-55), pp. 273-94 Synopsis: A The metaphorical word (the focus) vis Li vis the other words (the frame), in a simple case of metaphor, 273-5 B When the same focus appears in another frame, what, if anything, entitles us to call it 'the same metaphor again'? 276 C Some analogy between the two questions: (i) to what extent can we make the metaphorical character of an expression what we please? And (ii) to what extent can we make the meaning of words what we please? The importance of this, 276-8 D In a substitution view of metaphor, the focus is substituted for an expression which would have given the meaning literally; 278-80 E substituted, either because this literal expression is lacking to the vocabulary; 280-1 F or for stylistic reasons, 281-2 G The particular way in which metaphor transforms the literal meaning (as distinct from the way in which irony, hyperbole, etc. do) is often supposed to be that metaphor institutes a comparison, substituting something either similar to the literal way, or analogous.

'Use' is the whole field of 18</page><page sequence="23">BRAITHWAITE Braithwaite, M. M.-continued meaning of a word. 'Usages' are the main meanings in the most frequent contexts, and make up the use of a word. 'Uses' are the slightly different shades of meaning of a word, 209-10 B (i) 'Everybody knows what a word is'. One can only take the uses in the Oxford English dictionary. But these are insufficient, since a philosopher needs to consider 'senses of a word' and metaphoric uses. How finely, then, should we sub-divide uses? e.g. The uses of 'matter', in Wisdom's paper, Moore's technique. Is 'matter' in different contexts a different statement or a different word? Philosphers cannot rely on grammarians to define 'word' since grammarians are not agreed as to what a word is, 210-5 C (ii) 'Nobody knows what a word is'. The philosophical grammarian takes account of facts acquired from learning languages; the philospher of languages, of facts acquired from learning his own language. The latter not naive, since languages are not logically homogeneous. But the philospher of language can only 'keep up' with the linguist. Examples from the linguist Chao's Logical structures of chinese words, to exhibit linguists' difficulties in defining 'word'. 'Word' in English and Chinese: agreement on facts, but none on which way of describing them should be stressed. Chao distinguishes seven or eight logical conceptions of a word, 215-22 D (iii) 'From the point of view of logic and philosophy, it doesn't matter anyway what a word is, since the statement is what matters, not the words'. It is not enough for the philospher just to 'keep up with' the linguist's logical revelations, since a new conception of 'word' will affect his conception of a statement; for: (a) if the logical conception of tZU4 (this-Chinese for word,-has much wider spread than it has in English) be adopted as the logical unit, this has fundamental logical effects. (b) Analytic technique of studying a word in context, commits the user to a technique which works in terms of tzu4, not in terms of words. Chao's plea for a Chinese which should be made up of general words; but this is, in effect, a demand for the Platonic idea as the logical unit. The formal examination of a script based on tZU4 should yield clues to the kind of logical concepts required to 'model' formns in a language made of general words. Example of a philosophical argument to show different uses of 'know'. New logical units require new logics. One side, in this argument, has the total spread of 'know' as its logical unit; the other has only one use of 'know'. Sentence showing the different uses of the word 'ward'. Formalization of this sentence. A completely determinate 'statement' can never be built out of a sequence of indeterminate tzu4, however long the sequence be. If we base our logics on tzu4, and not on words, we shall only in the infinite case get the (assumed to be) completely determinate 'statement' of propositional logic-and this, even if there were no other formal difference between a sequence of tzu4 and a statement in propositional logic. The logical importance of finding out what we think about words, lies in the fact that our conception of a 'statement' is fundamentally affected by our logical conception of a word, 223-32 BRAITHWAITE, R.

And which of the 'questions' is a third symposiast to treat? I confine myself to that of the 'reducibility' of numbers (a la Frege and Russell) to classes of co-similar classes, 121-2 B Reduction, so far from necessarily confusing categories, may quite often signalise difference of category, 122 C When reduction shows an A-thing to be a 'logical construction' out of a B-thing, it may precisely accentuate their differences of category, 122-3 D The Peano reduction of rational numbers to natural numbers, for example, is very definitely a reduction of something to something else of a different category; and it is a reduction which is quite uncontroversial, 123-5 E The Frege-Russell-Quine reduction of natural numbers is concerned with reducing the contexts in which they occur. Mr. Thomson ignores this, 125-6 F Mr. Warnock's puzzlement about the expression 'x is a number', 126-8 G Why it must be remembered that Frege and Russell included in what they were analysing, empirical numerical propositions, 128 H What are numbers? If Mr. Thomson would complete his own answer to this question, he would find himself among the 'reductionists'; 129-30 I excepting only, perhaps, in their overlooking of a supposed difference of category, when reducing 2 (for example) to the class of all couples, 130-1 J But is there not here a difference of category? 131-3 K The positive case for reducibility of numbers to classes of co-similar classes, 133-4 L The logicist's reduction of numbers to classes is only an incidental feature of his main aim, that of the total reduction of arithmetic to what I call 'pre-numerical logic', 134-5 M Mr. Thomson's assumptions do not propose to 'unmask' arithmetic; they try to locate it in a wider field, 136-8 14 Common action towards different moral ends, Vol. LIII (1952-53), pp. 29-46 Synopsis: A The aim: to state some principles which, if accepted by the people concerned, would assist them to co-operate in action, even if pursuing different moral ends, 29-30 B In the very simplest case (which is what we are to consider, here) two people, M and N, 19</page><page sequence="24">BRITTON Braithwaite, R. B.-continued are to agree upon which of two courses is to be their common course of action, 30-1 C The moral notions involved in the case will be given as two asymmetrical relations, namely M-better than (better to M than) and N-better than (better to N than). The logic will be merely propositional logic applied to the trichotomy, M-better than, M-wvorse than, M-neither-better-nor-worse than, and to the trichotomy N-better than, N-worse than, N-neither-better-nor-worse than, 31-2 D The relata of M-better than and N-better than are total possible states of the universe, past, present and future (called outcomes). M's preference for one outcome will be taken as based on the proposition that it would be M-better than some other outcome. Similarly with N's preference. Principles are suggested according to which they could co-operate (i) if basing their preferences upon beliefs after the one, and (ii) if basing their preferences upon beliefs after the other, of the two manners or ways in which this might be done, 32-4 E (i) The first way. Here are shown three principles which, if accepted, would tend to minimise deadlocks and leave co-operation open, 34-8 F (ii) The second way. The further principles which (in this way of basing moral preferences upon beliefs) ought to maximise the possibilities of co-operation if thev are accepted, 38-44 G Brief comments upon the latter principles, 44 H The allevia- tion of moral difficulty which the principles could achieve, numerically stated, 44-5 I How such results ought to concern the moral philosopher, 45-6 BRITTON, K. 4 Seeming, Symposium (with H. H. Price and A. Quinton), Suppl. XXVI (1952), pp. 195-214 Synopsis: A The sense of 'it seems' to be here discussed, e.g. 'the penny seems elliptical' 195-7 B Philosophers have held (i) that the shape, here, is the 'sensible' (not 'physical') shape; and (ii) that the sensible shape is basic, the physical being merely a disposition to present a certain sensible shape (Cf.C.D. Broad). But this is simply a misleading account of the fact that it takes (or may take) many observations to settle what is the shape of the object, 198-200 C 'The penny seems elliptical' involves reference to a false judgment that it is so. The first, the judgment that it seems elliptical, is about the penny, not about 'the ap- pearance' of it; and it uses 'elliptical' in the sense in which, e.g. a pond may be elliptical, 200-03 D There are two procedures. Description may be (i) (directly) of a physical property; or (ii) of the way a physical object appears from a certain position. The first is achieved by observing many different appearances of the object; the second by observing a single appearance, 203-5 E The argument 'if the object appears elliptical, then the appearance is so'. Its bearing upon problems of illusion, 205-7 F Perhaps illusions ought to be tackled one by one; and perhaps no single factor could explain them all; e.g. many illusions do not turn upon mistakes of vision at all, 207 G But some do involve seeing things which are not physical, and saying of them that they are round or elliptical or red or yellow. Does this merely mean that we should say that they had these qualities if we took them for bodies? We certainly cannot mean that an image seems red or round. We must mean that thev are so, though not in the same sense as physical things, 208-11 H 'The mountains look warm and pink'. Clearly there is nothing here that is warm. Why must there be something that is pink? 211 I But there is no doubt a way of not seeing physical objects, which involves 'having sensations'. If we try to describe the latter it must be by means of the public language we have learnt to apply to bodies, 211-12 J In the procedure of describing physical objects, what is characteristic is that one observation may be used as a check upon others: and especially that what other people report is a check upon what I observe. All this is shown in the language in which we describe physical qualities and positions. The language of appearance is an addition to the physical-object language, and could not replace it, 213-14 5 What does a moral judgment commit me to? Vol. LIV (1953-54), pp. 97-114 Synopsis: A Introduction: when I judge that an action is right or wrong, I commit myself in certain ways: to use these words and not meet these commitments is to lay oneself open to logical (not moral) objections. These constitute the meaning of 'right' and 'wrong', 97 B I commit myself to a view of the facts of the case. If it is shown that my moral judgment rests on a false view of the facts, this counts as a logical objection to it, 97-8 C I com- mit myself to applying my criteria wherever they can (logically) be applied. If I make ex- ceptions without reason, I show that I misunderstand the meaning of 'right' and 'wrong': for a judgment of right and wrong means a judgment made upon principle, 99-100 D I commit myself to disagreeing with those who (either because-as above-they take a different view of the facts of the case, or because they have different criteria) judge the same actions differently from me. It is sometimes held that moral disputes between those who adopt different criteria, are about the meaning of 'right' and 'wrong'. But although we can settle a dispute of this kind about, say, 'democracy' by admitting that the word has different senses, we evidently cannot in this way settle a dispute about 'right' and 'wrong', 100-03 E I do not necessarily commit myself to blaming whomsoever does what I call 20</page><page sequence="25">BROAD Britton, K.-continued 'wrong': but moral praise and blame are in part governed by the way I judge actions to be right or wrong. (i) I have a reason to praise A for doing an action x if I should have re- garded x as right on his view of the facts of the case. I do not regard him as having done a wrong act merely because I can see that the facts of the case are not what he took them to be (Cf. G. E. Moore, Ethics, ch. V.), 104-9 F (ii) I have more reason to praise A for doing x than I have to praise B for doing y, if on my view it would be right to do x rather than y in a case where one had to chose between them, 109-11 G (iii) But moral praise and blame depend also on other factors, e.g. motives, and the difficulties or advantages of the agent's position, 111-13 H (iv) It is sometimes held that, just as praise and blame depend on the agent's view, not on my view, of the facts of the case (where the two views differ) so praise or blame also depend upon the agent's standards or criteria of right and wrong, not mine (where these differ). But would one not blame a man who knew he was causing pain and thought it did not matter? In my view anyone who holds that such an action is wrong, has a logical reason to blame a person who does it even if he (the agent) does not think it wrong, 113-14 BROAD, C. D. 22 Kant's mathematical antinomies, Vol. LV (1954-55), pp. 1-22 Synopsis: A 1 The argument Kant used in the antinomies themselves can perhaps be profitably discussed apart from either his own philosphy or the findings of contemporary pure mathematics, 1 B (A) THE FIRST ANTINOMY. Here Kant indirectly proves first the thesis and then the antithesis, by refuting first the antithesis and then the thesis, assuming the two to be collectively exhaustive alternatives, 1-2 C 1.1 The argument concerning duration (I) Refutation of antithesis. Kant says it is impossible that an infinite series of events should elapse before a given event, 2 D His own definition (as opposed to others he rejects) of an infinite quantum. Its weakness is that it defines the infinity (say, of the legth of a line) in terms of a temporal sequence such as could not be completed in any time however long; 2-3 E Whereas the infinity only requires that no number of adjoined units could constitute a line so long, 3-4 F Next, Kant seems vaguely to argue that, seeing the events previous to any given date have in fact synthesised themselves, the world's duration till then cannot have been infinitely long, 4 G However unsatisfactory it be otherwise, this argument does show recognition by Kant that in the case of time, as not in the case of space, the synthesis-operation is intrinsic. It constitutes temporal (as it does not spatial) extension, 4-5 H The argument in favour of a world-beginning would only be plausible if the synthesis, said to be already completed at the date given, be taken as extrinsic, 5 I If we make the synthesis extrinsic by reckoning backwards from a given event, the alternatives of a first event and of no first event seem equally possible logically, 5 J The theory of a world-beginning profits by our inadvertently transferring features of a process in time to the course of time itself, 6 K The argument concerning duration (II) Refutation of thesis. Kant alleges that a first event would entail the existence of empty time previous to it. Since, in this empty time there could be no sufficient reason why a first event should occur at one moment rather than at another, there cannot be a first event at any moment, 6-7 L But, on a relational view of time, to say that there would be empty time before the first event could only mean that earlier events than the actual first were logically possible, 7 M 1.11 Additional comments on THE FIRST ANTINOMY as regards time. (i) If argument from analogy between abstract entities and actual existents has any weight, then the duration of the world from any point backwards might be finite even if there was no first event, 7-9 N (ii) In view of the three logically-possible alternative findings about the world's history thus remaining, the fundamental issue would seem to concern the possibility or otherwise, not of the finite duration of the world, but of there having been a first event. Personal opinions, here, on five points, 9 P The difficulty of holding a first event to be possible is probably due to a certain ineluctability about the notion of cause understood not as law but as genera- tion, 9-10 Q 1.2 The argument concerning extension. (I) Refutation of antithesis. Here, having argued first to something which the world cannot be viewed as being, Kant concludes that it logically could not be this, 10-11 R And the first argument, so far from showing that an infinitely extended world could not exist, does not even show that it could not be conceived, 11-12 S The argument concerning extension (II) Refutation of thesis. He!e, Kant's argument seems to be that, if the world were of finite extent, it must be related to empty space outside it; whilst, on the other hand, empty space is nothing and therefore cannot be a term in any relationship. The argument fails, whether we interpret 'empty space' in terms of the absolute or the relational theory of space, 12-13 T 1.21 Additional comments on THE FIRST ANTINOMY as regards space. (i) Some of the alternative systems of geometry developed since Kant's time would make 'absolute space' intrinsically unlimited, others intrinsically finite, 13 U Only empirical evidence could decide the question whether the geometry of nature is of the former (open) or of the latter (closed) kind; and, granted it is of the former sort, the evidence for the world's being finite or infinite is also 21</page><page sequence="26">BROTMAN Broad, C. D.-continued empirical. But the facts which would decide the first issue are of a higher order of generality than those which would settle the second, 13-14 V (ii) Kant would not have agreed (with e.g. Hegel) that the very notion of an infinite quantum is contradictory, 14 W (iii) Kant uses his own critical philosophy, here, in arguments which he represents as being such as any ordinary intelligent person would employ. Further, he ought not to treat (as he does) his own doctrine of space and time as if it could be supported by conclusions which, in the antinomies, it is used to support, 14-15 X (B) THE SECOND ANTINOMY (I) Proof of thesis. Kant argues that a compound substance can (logically) only be an aggregate of simple ones. This (on its premises) does prove the hypothetical conclusion: if there are substances they are simple. It does not prove that there are simple substances, 15-16 Y Kant's observation that this argument would not apply to absolute space (or time) seems to be just . But it raises the question whether the material world may not be similarly regarded, 16-17 Z A point in which Leibniz would seem to have the better of Kant, is in his allegation (in proof of the sim- plicity of genuine substance) that the alternative view involves a vicious infinite regress, 17 AA THE SECOND ANTINOMY (II) Proof of the antithesis. Assertion (i). Kant argues (against the hypothesis of simple parts) that each of the alleged simple substances of which a body could be composed would have to be compound in order to occupy its volume of space, 17-18 BB Apart from doubt as to whether only an extended object logically could be compound, any critic of the thesis must allow (a) that a body which consisted of a finite number of unextended particles could conceivably occupy its volume of space only dis- continuously; and (presuming it to be legitimate to apply mathematical notions of infinity and continuity to the space and time of nature) he must allow (b) that a body made up of unextended particles could occupy a volume of space continuously if the number of particles were of an order of infinity high enough. The conditions of this, 18-20 CC Kant's argument goes wrong by using 'occupy' in the sense, not of 'fall within', but of 'fill', 20 DD THE SECOND ANTINOMY (II) Proof of the antithesis. Assertion (ii). Kant does not claim to give a proof of this second assertion of the antithesis, 20 EE CONCLUD- ING REMARKS. A genuine antinomy would demand a solution, and this might take either of two forms. But Kant's 'mathematical antinomies' have been shown not to be genuine antinomies, and therefore do not require a solution of either kind, 21-2 BROTMAN, H. 1 The concept of welfare in economics, Symposium (with W. D. Lamont and J. P. Corbett), Suppl. XXVII (1953), pp. 183-210 Synopsis: A The first Part of this paper deals with two points raised by Dr. Lamont. First, what is the most accurate way of describing economics, in so far as it is concerned with the study of individuals? And the paper describes how recent economic theory restates the postulates of individuals' economic activity, in terms of actual choices; avoiding reference either to unobservable psychological factors, such as personal gain; or to concepts possibly involving value judgments, such as welfare and happiness. The significance of this reap- praisal, 183-6 B Secondly, in what sense are value judgments involved, when in- dividuals' economic welfare is discussed? A judgment about individual economic welfare is, strictly speaking, a factual judgment; but in practice such factual judgments are extremely difficult to make correctly. In consequence, seeing that they form an important basis for evaluating economic policy, they come to be used persuasively, 186-9 C Part 2. Some comments on Dr. Lamont's solution to the paradox, that the free pursuit of individual welfare can result in the pursuit of the common welfare. Criticism of the emphasis placed on the role of the juridical system, in enforcing agreements. The importance of this factor is connected with the type of agreements enforced, 190-2 D Although laisser-faire ensures some co-operation for the common good, it will only be in certain restricted circum- stances (e.g. under perfect competition) that all available possibilities for improvement will be exploited, 192-4 E Part 3. General discussion of the concept of welfare in economics. The following views are dealt with: (i) the view that the welfare of a community is some- thing objective and can be described as a sum of individual welfares, 194-7 F (ii) TIhe view that the welfare of a community must be considered as directly determined by a set of concrete economic variables, in a way which depends on specific decisions on ends. In- dividual welfares or utilities cannot be measured or compared, and therefore cannot be used as a basis for normative precepts, 197-8 G This complete denial of the comparability and measurability of utilities is too sweeping, 198-9 H Various efforts are described, that have aimed at establishing acceptable decisions on ends; and at providing criteria, for advocating economic policy and for defining increases in real income, without interpersonal comparisons of utility. Attempts to provide such criteria encounter difficulties over the question, "What is a favourable distribution of purchasing power?" 199-206 I The paper concludes by summarizing: (i) what the welfare economist can say, (ii) what are his aims, (iii) what use the subject is, 207-10 J One point here made is that the welfare economist has before him the choice of either (a) selecting objective factors, which are 22</page><page sequence="27">CARRE Brotman, H.-continued of some help in evaluating an economic change but do not have great significance in making an appraisal, or (b) suggesting factors, which are of great significance but can scarcely be defined objectively, and which run the risk of being meaningless. The practical economist makes the former choice, 208-10 *BROWN, G. S. 1 Randomness, Symposium (with G. B. Keene), Suppl. XXXI (1957), pp. 145-50 Synopsis: A The concept of chance arises from the possibility of being descriptively wrong, 145-6 B Probability is to be defined in terms of the proportion of times an event is correctly predicted, not in terms of its frequency, 146-7 C Tests of randomness are made on a series in order to ascertain whether a machine producing it is 'a good bamboozler', 148 D Randomness could be a property of a series, only if we all agreed what to predict and none of us changed his mind. But we don't agree and we do change our minds. There are thus no random series, 150 BROWN, N. J. I J7udgment and the structure of language, Vol. LII (1951-52), pp. 23-46 Synopsis: A Words used in true statements have been said not to mirror, even indirectly, features of reality; this is not true; if it were, certain features of language would be unex- plained, 23 B There is no one-to-one correspondence of nouns to things, adjectives to qualities and the like; but there are limits determining the range of grammatical forms in which a given fact can be expressed, 23-8 C The nature of the transformation-rules governing this range, is not determined simply by the categorial structure of reality. Mean- ing is not a dyadic relation of words to things; it is a function of the triadic relation of symbol, referent and user; and the use depends on the knowledge and purposes of the user-in fact on judgment, 28-30 D Both denoting-expressions and describing- expressions are related to determinate aspects of reality, though both only by virtue of use. Denoting-expressions, as such, refer only to the individuality of their referents; while describing-expressions refer, according to their definitions, to certain characteristics of the referents of the associated denoting-expressions, 30-5 E Each descriptive element of language is therefore related to an element of the real as grasped in abstraction by the user's mind-that is, to a concept, which is not the referent but the sense of the verbal term, 35-8 F Because terms and things are related via concepts and not directly, the relation between metaphysical and linguistic categories is indirect and complex. At the primary level, each metaphysical category is most naturally expressed by a corresponding grammatical category-e.g. substance by substantive; but at the secondary level extensions occur;-e.g. when we make an attribute the subject of thought we use an (abstract) sub- stantive, 38-45 G It follows that no direct argument is possible from parts of speech to categories of being; but the view that they are unrelated, or that the latter are projections of the former, has given rise to as many philosophical errors as the view that the relation is dyadic, 45-6 CAMERON, J. M. 1 The justification of political attitudes, Symposium (with T. D. Weldon), Suppl. XXIX (1955), pp. 93-114 Synopsis: A 'Attitude' has various meanings. Our subject, here, is their justification, 93-4 B For political action, in the middle ages, only moral justification was needed, 94-5 C In e.g. Hobbes's Leviathan, however, a vision of the human situation is presented, which is calculated both to cause the political attitudes he recommends, and to justify them; but logical justification is not offered, 95-9 D The paradox of illuminative power, in this field, accompanying logical incoherence, 99-101 E The position, principally that of Marxism, that political attitudes are not to be justified (or refuted) but are only to be explained-by pointing out their hidden motivation. Discussion of the self-refuting charac- ter of this position, 101-5 F There seems to come a point at which the agent has to face the question of 'the moral foundations and the casuistry' of political obligations. The impossibility of founding such obligations upon a morality which is one of several moralities, different and equally valid, 106-9 G Rationality of moral discourse does not depend on its place (or even on its having a place) on the logician's chart, 109-13 H Negatively, there seem to be political attitudes which morality requires us to reject, whether or not, positively, there are those it requires us to accept, 113-14 CARRIE, M. H. 1 Statesmen and Metaphysics, Vol. L (1949-50), pp. 83-94 Synopsis: A In the nineteenth century political policy was at times influenced by certain broad presuppositions relating to cosmology, standards of knowledge, and theology, 83-4 23</page><page sequence="28">CHISHOLM Carre, M. H.-continued B The bearing of the notion of providential order can be traced, for example, at many points, 85-6 C This theology was associated with scholastic ideas of function and hierarchy, as exhibited in Burke, Wilberforce and other politicians. The providential perfection of the constitution, and a nicely graded society of special qualifications, duties and privileges, were deemed to be features of the natural order, 87-9 D The demand for equal rights produced an opposing scheme of a priori notions, which were challenged for instance by Lowe, 90-1 E But the hierarchical metaphysics reappeared in the Young England movement, which owed its beliefs to Bolingbroke. This philosophy was supported by the Tractarians, 91-2 F Another aspect of this philosophy of politics was extreme scholastic realism, evident in Disraeli and his followers, 92-3 G These assumptions could be traced in common law. The democratic movement, after Peel, destroyed the old principles; but they held their own in theological metaphysics, 93-4 CHISHOLM, R. M. 1 Sentences about believing, Vol. LVI (1955-56), pp. 125-48 Synopsis: A Any simple declarative sentence is intentional, if either (a) it uses a substantival expression in such a way that neither the sentence nor its contradictory implies that there is anything to which that expression truly applies; or (b) it contains a subordinate proposi- tional clause without implying that that clause is true or that it is false; or (c) it contains a substantival expression whose replacement by a synonymous expression will result in a sentence not implied by the original sentence. A compound declarative sentence is inten- tional if any of its components is intentional, 125-9 B We do not need to use intentional sentences when we describe non-psychological phenomena. But when we describe psycho- logical phenomena, either we must use intentional sentences or we must use a vocabulary we do not need for describing non-psychological phenomena, 129-33 C Recent attempts to describe believing in 'behaviouristic' terms do not succeed in showing the foregoing thesis to be false. The terminology of 'specific response' does not enable us to describe believing. Descriptions in terms of 'appropriate behaviour' make use of intentional sen- tences. The terminology of 'linguistic behaviour' is not sufficient for the description of believing, unless the linguistic behaviour is described in terms not needed for the descrip- tion of non-psychological phenomena. And similarly for the terminology of 'expectation- fulfilment' and 'expectation-disruption', 134-47 D Hence there is some presumption in favour of Brentano's thesis that 'intentionality' is peculiar to psychological phenomena, 147-8 COHEN, L. J. I Teleological explanation, Vol. LI (1950-51), pp. 255-92 Synopsis: A Sentences are here called 'teleological', if and only if they include the conjunc- tive phrase 'in order to', or its equivalents, or can be paraphrased by such a sentence; and the paper will discuss the use of such sentences in asserting explanations, 255-6 B Defini- tion of the logical sense of 'explanation' here intended; and distinction between 'complete' and 'incomplete' explanations, 256-60 C The mistake of assimilating teleological explanations, in terms of human purposes, to ordinary causal explanations, is sometimes due to a reluctance to admit the possibility of incomplete explanations, 260-9 D Reasons why it is a mistake to hold that all teleological explanations cite "the function" of what is to be explained, 269-72 E Reasons why it is equally wrong to hold that all teleological explanations cite "the purpose" of what is to be explained; and suggestions as to how to account for the teleological form of functional explanations, 272-9 F The view that explanation is "either mechanistic or teleological" represents a bogus dichotomy, 279-82 G Purposive explanations attribute a particular type of belief and intention to the agent, 282-5 H They imply rational, but not necessarily deliberate behaviour; they can be used to establish the degrees of influence of various factors in some human situation; and they may refer collectively to groups of people, without implying the existence of a group mind, 285-91 I The logical analysis of functional explanation should be dis- tinguished from enquiry into the merits of biological theories like emergent vitalism, 291-2 2 A relation of counterfactual conditionals to statements of what makes sense, (1954-55), pp. 45-82 Synopsis: A Analytical reconstruction of counterfactual conditionals requires a language, in which one can talk about the varying sense or nonsense made by its own sentences in different contexts. How this is to be shown, and what it illuminates, 45-7 B Our normal pattern of calculation, with certain generalisations, defines the main topic for analysis, 47-50 C A modal language developed for analysing such generalisations, which by- passes Quine's objections to modal language, 50-5 D This language shows up the difficulties in certain familiar kinds of theory, 55-7 E But one type of statement in the language licenses precisely the specified pattern of calculation, including the deduction of 24</page><page sequence="29">COPLESTON Cohen, L. J.-continued counter-factuals, 57-62 F It also avoids certain paradoxes in the notion of confirmation -paradoxes exposed by Hempel, 62-4 G Accidentally-true generalisations thus distinguished from generalisations non-accidently true, 64-7 H In this analytical language, to say that an event could not have been otherwise implies, but is not implied by, the statement that it has a cause, 67-9 I A sharp distinction between grammar and logic is vital to such analyses, 69-72 J Modal formulae become less and less appropriate, in the logically-articulate reconstruction of science, as scientific theory becomes more systematic, 72-8 K But, when a non-modal language does become appropriate, several important distinctions are inevitably lost; such as that between being caused and being physically necessary, 78-82 3 Theory and definition in jurisprudence, Symposium (with H. L. A. Hart), Suppl. XXIX (1955), pp. 213-38 Synopsis: A The problem: can one always screen-off juristic definition from the heated atmosphere of juristic theory, as Professor Hart supposes, in his essay Definition and theory in jurisprudence, Law Quarterly Review Jan. 1954 ? 213-15 B A Wittgensteinian ap- proach to problems of definition cannot be relied upon to secure this screening, 215-16 C Two different types of legal concept, requiring contextual definition for correspondingly different reasons, 217-20 D Distinction between defining a concept for a particular legal system, and defining it for all developed systems, 220-2 E A system of rules must have at least three special characteristics, if it is to be correctly entitled a system of 'legal rules', 222-3 F Reasoned controversy must be possible about its application to particular cases; it must impose sanctions; and it must in principle cover every facet of its subjects' activities, 223-6 G It follows that in all legal systems occasional gaps, vaguenesses or antinomies are inevitable, which can only be determined by invoking politico-moral considerations, 227 H Illustrations from the working of the U.S.A., British, Swiss, French, U.S.S.R. and other systems, 228-31 I This feature of legal argument prevents the logical separation of theory from definition in jurisprudence, as is shown even by 'lawyer-minded' juristic theories, 232-5 J 'Legis- lator-minded' theories make the point more evident, 235-8 COOPER, N. 1 Rules and morality, Symposium (with R. Edgley), Suppl. XXXIII (1959), pp. 159-72 Synopsis: A It is difficult to reach a definition of morality, insulated from a particular moral standpoint, 159 B The word 'morality' is, however, sometimes used in such a neutral, 'unconstricted' sense, satisfying certain formal requirements, 160 C The purpose of the paper is to argue that in this 'unconstricted' sense of the word, there are no logical limits to the rejection of moral concepts, 161 D The language of moral rules, for example, is neither the whole, nor even a logically-essential part, of a morality. For, firstly, 'works of supererogation' (actions which go beyond duty) are logically possible, and the "good-ought" tie-up is thus not logically necessary, 161ff E The denial of this arrises from a confusion of prescriptive recommendation with commendatory recommenda- tion, 162 F Any attempt to retain a logically-necessary "good-ought" tie-up deprives the word 'ought' of its distinctively prescriptive character, 164 G This happens in some formulations of ideal moralities. Higher and lower moralities may be accepted simultaneously; but tension between them reveals itself, in distinctive dimensions of moral language, 165 H Secondly, rule-less moralities are logically possible. A pseudo- Kantian community of holy wills, and on the other hand moral nihilism, would be examples of this, 166-8 I Moral nihilism is a limiting case of a morality, 169 J The nihilist ('nothing matters morally') rejects all moral concepts, including the concept of the moral 'ought'; but he has to use the concept of moral importance, in order to state his position, 170 K This reveals the 'front-line' rOle of the concept of importance. The concepts o moral and non-moral importance are related, in that if anybody thinks that something matters morally he is logically committed to thinking that it matters more than anything which matters non-morally, 170 L This does not, however, rule out moral nihilism as a morality, 171-2 M Some apparent counter-examples considered, 171-2 COPLESTON, F.

P. 1 The concept of welfare in economics, Symposium (with W. D. Lamont and H. Brotman), Suppl. XXVII (1953), pp. 211-30 Synopsis: A The philosophical problems presented by economic theory arise from the attempt to fit its components into a system of classification designed for natural science. Hume's threefold distinction between necessary, factual and evaluative statements is applicable'to economic theory, but only if it is properly used, 211-14 B 'Economic theories can only be framed on the assumption of social policies. The notorious paradoxes of economic theory disappear if, and only if, this type of assumption is recognised. The economist presents a model, not (as the physicist) of' what is, but of what ought to be, 214-22 C Welfare economics has consisted in a number of attempts to avoid this recognition by establishing supposedly 'objective' or 'scientific' criteria for economic policy. The theories which result are prolonged exercises in the fallacy of equivocation, 222-9 D Such theories arise ultimately from the desire to reason political conflict out of the world, 229-30 COUSIN, D. R. 3 Truth, Symposium (with J. L. Austin and P. F. Strawson), Suppl. XXIV (1950), pp. 157-72 Synopsis: A' An introduction, proposing to say non-committally that 'T-statements' e.g. "the statement 'the cat is on the mat' is true", are about their 'R-statements' (in this case the statement 'the cat is on the mat', 157-8 B 2-4 Reasons for preferring to say, still non- committally, that T-statements are about propositions, i.e. 'factworthy selections of real elements', 158-62 C 5 Different senses in which a T-statement may be, e.g. 'about the cat, about snoring, about the fact that the cat is snoring, or about the proposition that the purely unselfish cat does not exist, 162-3 D 6 To say that a proposition corresponds with a fact is not to say that a speech-episode has conformed to linguistic conventions. Conventions are necessary to make a statement intelligible, but more is required to make it true, 163-5 E 7 A theory of truth should be a recipe, in completely general terms, for explaining what we mean by any given T-statement. TIhe corre'spondence 'theory of truth achieves universal applicability at the expense of circularity, and tells us nothing, 165-9 F 8. Is it possible to combine the views of Ramsey and Russell by saying that a T-sentence is not about anything which its R-sentence is not about, but is about the same factworthy selection of real elements? The difference between a T-sentence and its R-sentence would then concern, not what is stated, but the occasion, manner, purpose, etc., of its being stated, 169-71 G 9. An attempt to relate the foregoing to the views (misunderstood) of the other symposiasts, 171-2 4 Naive realism, Vol. LV (1954-55), pp. 179-200 Synopsis: A An introductory summary, 179-80 B Price on naive realism, taken as a discussion of the proposal to treat a restricted range of ordinary expressions, as adequate for the description of perceptual experience, 180-3 C These expressions (the verbs of perceiving) have some logic in common. Price's discussion shows that they are inadequate in illusory situations. Ordinary language is less inadequate, as Ayer points out; but this is because it includes the verbs of appearing, 183-8 D 'Inadequacy' of concepts. Con- cepts (rules for the use of words) are inadequate when there are situations in which they would authorize contradictory statements. The concepts of perception do this in illusory situations, 188-91 E Could the concepts of perception be dispensed with altogether, in favour of a thing-language? The concepts of appearing would still be needed, 191-4 F We could also help out with comparison and modality, 194-5 G The thing-language would be insufficient even if not inadequate; since without the concepts of perception we could not make biographical, historical or psychological statements, 195-6 H Professor Price mistook the bodily-adjustment theory for an alternative to the admission of perceptual consciousness. It is rather an analysis of it; it is a proposed set of rules for using verbs of perception, 196-8 I Lacking these verbs, a behaviouristic language might enable us to describe perceptually conscious behaviour, but only at the cost of intolerable circumlocu- tion, 198-9 J So the concepts of perception, in spite of their inadequacy have their uses. 199-200 26</page><page sequence="31">DUMMETT CROSS, R. C. 2 Virtue and nature, Vol. L (1949-50), pp. 123-137 Synopsis: A The contention that virtue consists in following nature, 123 B The varying uses to which this conviction can be put. For some of Plato's characters, to play the tyrant is to follow nature and so is justified, 123-5 C Modern appeals to nature (evolution- ethics, e.g.) seem sometimes to sanction conduct very different from this. In these (i) we keep reading-in what we think we only observe, in nature; we then (ii) decide about follow- ing or not what we have thus unwittingly imputed, 125-8 D Plato, in reaction to those characters, seems to question (not their having appealed to nature but) their conception of nature. He still himself thinks that we can argue from a purely factual statement to what we ought to do, 128-32 E The same appeal to fact seems to reappear in contemporary objectivist ethics, cf Ross, 132-3 F But (i) the road to the good life is not all objectively mapped out and only waiting for us to read it. (ii) If it were, our problem is still not merely to describe or read, but to decide and act, 133-4 G The intuitionist however thinks that we are left only with a chaotic subjectivism, unless the action possesses some ethical charac- teristic which is the ultimate 'reason' for the action. Ewing quoted. Against this, discussion of Hampshire's view of factual judgments as establishing and supporting moral judgments without the citation of any non-natural ethical characteristic belonging to the action, 134-5 H But there still seems to be a gap between the supporting factual beliefs.

B. 1 Subjunctive conditionals, time-order and causation, Vol. LIX (1958-59), pp. 125-40 Synopsis: A An argument to show that empirical, non-truth-functional, conditional state- ments ('subjunctive conditionals') cannot be temporally backward-looking, i.e. their consequents cannot contain references to times earlier than any referred to in their antece- dents, 125-32 B Subjunctive conditionals contrasted with subjunctive implications. The latter are neutral as to time order. Subjunctive implications concerned with the con- ditions under which their antecedents might be fulfilled, 132-4 C Similar arguments show that subjunctive conditionals not only cannot be backward-looking; they must be forward-looking, 134-6 D On this finding, there is a recognizable asymmetry between past and future, 136 E Since causal statements entail subjunctive conditionals, a cause must precede its effect, 136-40 DUMMETT, M. 1 Can an effect precede its cause? Symposium (with A. Flew), Suppl. XXVIII (1954), pp. 27-44 Synopsis: A To make temporal precedence a defining property of causes is not sufficient. It suggests the wrong question. The problem is not why we do not call a sufficient condition of an earlier event a 'cause' of it; the question is why we should not use this later 'cause' to ensure that the earlier event shall have occurred, 27ff B Of any two simultaneous and causally connected events (say, the stroke of the cue and the roll of the ball) that one is called the cause of the other, which can be explained (perhaps by reference to some previous event or to some human action: in any case, which can be explained) without reference to the other. When a cause initiates a process whose subsequent continuance does not demand explanation, then, if the initiation is to be the 'effect', the cause is simultaneous with the effect, and is its immediate cause,. 27-31 C When an event is observed to be a sufficient condition of a previous one, we could offer the later of the two as (what we could legiti- 27 c2</page><page sequence="32">DUMMETT Dummett, M.-continued mately call) the quasi-cause of the earlier, provided three requirements were satisfied, namely (i) that without the later event the earlier could not be explained, (ii) that the earlier event could not be explained as the remote cause of the later, and (iii) that we could explain the later without reference to the earlier, 31-4 D Objection: If there were such quasi- causes, would it be reasonable to bring them about, and so secure their quasi-effects ? This would be to do something in order that something else should have happened, 34-5 E But need this be absurd? In what does the absurdity consist? A wrong answer would be that the absurdity lies in our having described the action in this way; as if, whenever I performed an action B which is a sufficient condition of an earlier event A with this event in mind, this were always to be described as my finding out whether A had occurred. The answer is wrong because the description presupposes that I should not regard B as an action which it is in my power to perform or not to perform; whereas, if I did so regard it, I should have to be described as performing it in order that A should have occurred, 35-7 F Objection: If A has not occurred, B cannot both be a sufficient condition of A and an action which it is in my power to perform. Reply: A parallel argument would show that no action could both be a sufficient condition of some subsequent event and one which it was in my power to perform, 37-41 G Admittedly, if I know whether A has happened, independently of my intention to perform B, it cannot be rational for me to do B in order to ensure A's having happened. But it would not necessarily be irrational if I did not know, 41-2 H Objection: If I knew that A had (had not) occurred, I should rightly regard it as redundant (fruitless) to perform B; hence if A has (has not) occurred, it would be redundant (fruitless) to perform B; thus it is in all cases either redundant or fruitless to perform B. Reply: The objection depends on taking quasi-casuality as a fact of nature independent of our knowledge. But even genuine causality is not that. e.g. Anyone who had the faculty of precognition would rightly regard it as either redundant or fruitless to do anything now to bring about or to prevent what he foresaw to be going to happen. It does not follow that such action is imilarly either redundant or fruitless for us who have not that faculty, 42-4 2 Truth, Vol. LIX (1958-59), pp. 141-62 Synopsis: A Two elements in Frege's theory of truth: (1) Truth-values are the references of sentences, 141 B The objection to this, is not that there cannot be such entities; or even that sentences do not have reference; but that if, with Frege, we take the sense of a sentence to be determined by the way in which its truth-conditions are stipulated, it dis- solves the connection between the sense of a sentence and its use. It is a feature of the concept of truth, that we so use sentences that we aim at uttering true sentences (or at least at being taken' so to aim); but this fact is omitted from Frege's account of truth, just as an explanation of winning a game which only states the conditions under which the game is said to be won, omits the fact that a player plays to win, 141-3 C In general, discussions of truth and falsity tend to ignore the necessity for explaining the point of classifying state- ments into true and false ones, i.e. the connection between this classification and the use of the statements, 143-4 D (2) The redundancy theory, viz. that the whole sense of 'true' is given by the principle (A), namely, that ' it is true that P' has the same sense as P, 144-5 E Difficulties about the redundancy theory: (i) (A) cannot be true if there is a sentence P which is neither true nor false, for then 'it is true that P' will be false while P is not, 144-5 F (ii) The redundancy theory is inconsistent with the principle that the general form of explanation of meaning is a stipulation of truth-conditions, which is part of (1) above. According to the redundancy theory, sentences which contain the word 'true' are to be explained by reference to sentences which do not; so to explain these in turn by stipulating under what conditions they are true would be circular. In particular, the truth-table explanations of the sentential operators would become questionable if the redundancy theory were accepted. Parallel to (A) would be an explanation of falsity in terms of negation: so that negation could not in turn be explained in terms of 'true' and 'false'; and the law of excluded middle could not be justified by reference to the truth-tables for 'or' and 'not', if the redundancy theory is accepted. The law of excluded middle is a specially striking case of our willingness to assert a disjunction 'P or Q' when our ultimate ground for doing so is neither evidence for the truth of P nor evidence for the truth of Q, 145-8 G If we accept the Frege-Tractatus view, that the general form of explanation of meaning is a stipulation of truth-conditions, we must supplement this by a theory of truth which would explain the connection between the truth-conditions of a sentence and its use. Such a theory would leave no place for saying, in given circumstances, that a certain sentence was neither true nor false. Any state of affairs either is such that the assertion of the sentence is taken to express the speaker's exclusion of the possibility of that state of affairs, or it is not. If no such state of affairs obtains, the sentence is true; otherwise it is false. Similarly, if we want to explain the use of imperatives in terms of obedience and disobedience, we must so explain these concepts that a command cannot indefinitely remain neither obeyed nor disobeyed. Bets, on the other hand, may be neither won nor lost, e.g. a conditional bet; but a conditional command is like a bet on the truth of the material conditional, not like 28</page><page sequence="33">EDGLEY Dummett, M.-continued a conditional bet, 148-56 H This does not mean that there is never any point in intro- ducing more than two truth-values: we may subdivide the cases in which a statement is true into different sub-cases, and we may similarly subdivide the cases in which it is false. Nomenclature is unimportant: we might reserve the words 'true' and 'false' for particular sub-cases, and distinguish, for the twofold classification, between designated and undesignated truth-values. But the two-fold classification is all that is needed for an account of the use of the statement itself: the justification of the finer classification is only that it may permit a truth-table explanation of certain sentential operators, when applied to the statement, which would otherwise be impossible, 156ff I The correspondence theory of truth embodies an important and correct principle: that a statement cannot be true unless there is something in virtue of which it is true. It is by reference to this principle that we ought to deny that, of two unopposed counterfactuals, one or other must be true. Realism is the belief that for any statement, there must be something in virtue of which either it or its negation is true. For statements of a given class, a realist theory is justified only when, for any statement P of that class, if we knew sufficiently many facts of the kind which normally justify us in asserting P, we should be in a position to assert either P or its negation; and 'sufficiently many' means 'some finite number of'. This means in turn that the statements of that class must be effectively decidable if a realist account of them is to hold good, 157-60 J Only for effectively decidable statements can we hold that their sense is given by stipulating their truth-conditions: for other statements we must describe their sense in terms of their assertability-conditions, i.e. directly in terms of their use. In general, the sentential connectives must likewise be so explained; such an explanation invalidates certain principles of classical logic, in particular the law of excluded middle. This is a defence of intuitionism by reference not to the constructivist picture of mathe- matics, but to considerations about meaning. These considerations are applicable to statements of all kinds, not only mathematical; whereas the constructivist picture, applied outside mathematics, would involve that we create the world. We therefore need a picture intermediate between the usual constructivist one and the realist one; and such a picture is available, 160-2 DUNCAN-JONES, A.

XXXIII (1959), pp. 173-94 Synopsis: A Can judgments about what morally ought to be done, be satisfactorily elucidated in terms of rules ? 173-6 B Rules are currently regarded as essential to reason. But rules are ineluctably practical, prescriptive, imperative. This creates a problem; for reason, as Hume argued, is essentially theoretical. The solution of this would be the solution of the problem set by the exposure of the naturalistic fallacy. If reason is possible in morals, 29</page><page sequence="34">EMMET Edgley, R. J.-continued there must be such a solution, 176-8 C Moral rules are not only practical but also universal. Given these two formal characteristics as logical requirements, what demands does reason thereby impose? Not simply that my moral rules should be self-consistent and my conduct consistent with my rules, without restriction upon the content of the rules. For, if inconsistency be contrary to reason, it is because at least one of the two inconsistent items is in itself contrary to reason. If prescriptive and universal, my moral rules must function also as principles of criticism or appraisal; and not only of my own conduct, but also of other people's. Thus reason requires consistency of conduct and rules between people, 178-80 D Principles of criticism a'e essentially theoretical: discussion of the mternal object of criticism, of the paradox of the one basic principle, of the relevance of the notions of justice and desert, and of the place of feelings and attitudes. From these considerations follows the impossibility of exclusive distinctions between theoretical, practical, and emotive utterances, 180-4 E Moral principles are practical neither as causally influencing conduct nor as entailing self-addressed imperatives. They are as-such principles, specifying underivative but not necessarily sufficient reasons for doing things (and therefore, as theoretical, for appraising conduct). Reasons also submit to the requirement of universality or consistency. It follows that different courses of action, ways of life, or moral codes, may be equally reasonable; but not because there is no rational restriction on the content of moral rules, 184-8 F What, at its most basic, is the nature of this restriction? From the agent's point of view there are certain kinds of fact that cannot but be underivative reasons for doing things: facts connected with his feeling in a broad sense, with his wants, likes and dislikes. These provide reasons of prudence. Moral reasons, at their most fundamental, have the same sort of content, but consistency demands that the point of view be extended from the agent to all those affected by the action, 189-94 EMMET, DOROTHY 4 Emphasis and importance, Vol. LI (1950-51), pp. 293-312 Synopsis: A 'Importance' a notion little noticed by philosophers, and said to be 'subjective'.

If this is so, what does it imply with respect to the kind of writing of whch it is true? 213 B Perhaps anonymity with respect to criticism may be taken as a general feature of all works of art.

(This theory critizised and exemplified by complementarity), 150-3 F (ii) The theory of phenomenological meaning-meaning determined by the phenomena experienced immediately before the adequate application of the term. (This theory shown to be untenable), 153-60 G The stability-thesis refuted. The interpretation of an observation-language can change, without perceptible effect upon (a) the phenomena: or (b) the 'characteristic'.

Have we a ghostly side to our nature, and how should we speak of it in relation to our grosser manefestations? 43-4 B The inquiry is metaphysical, in the sense that it is a search for the same kind of right ways of speaking, as people hitherto called metaphysicians are shown by their works to have been always seeking, 44-6 C Doing things 'with attention'. Of this, one story is told by Ryle with conspicuous success. 33</page><page sequence="38">FLEW Findlay, J. N.-continued But there is another story of it, not told; though it is interesting and well susceptible of being expressed, 46-9 D The ordinary mode of speech which makes two stories, an inward and an outward, of every conscious activity. No good ground for bringing this way of speaking under suspicion, 49-52 E How, then, deal with the relation of the two? Minimal conditions which would make reference to two agents a suitable mode of speech. Principles on which certain tendencies of our language seem to show we ought to and do decide such a point. (i) If unconscious adjustments continuously 'lead up' to conscious adjustments we have reason to speak of one agent; not so if there are sharp transitions, 52-4 F Reasons against speaking of two agents: (ii) cases of 'lead up' between non-conscious and conscious adjustments. Better to say a single person straddles two realms, 54-8 G Purposive and intelligent acts.

Lewy and S. K6rner), Suppl. XXVII (1953), pp. 21-44 Synopsis: A Preamble, 21-2 B Rapid sketch of the history of the notion, 21-6 C Cantor's contribution. Extension of the notion of number to groups having parts exemplifying all ordinary numbers: the sense in which an extension represents something new, and the sense in which it does not. Blurring of Cantor's insights, in the work of Russell, of the verificationists and of Quine, 27-31 D Sense in which a satisfactory account of the infinite must be 'intensional': it must not imply that there are or are not infinitely numerous things of any sort. The only tolerable 'axiom of infinity' is one that asserts the possibility of there being infinitely numerous things, 32-5 E Our account does not mean that numbers are peculiar entities or apply to peculiar entities (e.g. Frege's class-concepts): it is to ordinary things in the plural that numbers are normnally applicable, 36-9 F The 'possibility' of infinitely numerous things does not depend on a linguistic fiat: there is a 'lie of the land' which makes certain developments of speech 'natural' and 'inevitable', 40-2 G The difficulties of pointing to instances of the infinite are contingent. In a sense we know quite well what it would be like to observe such instances, 42-4 4 Some merits of Hegelianism, Vol. LVI (1955-56), pp. 1-24 Synopsis: A Need of an attempt to rehabilitate the repuation of Hegel, owing to con- temporary neglect and attacks (e.g. K. R. Popper). Development of thought in Britain 1900-50, as a 'museum-piece' of Hegelian dialectic. Hegelianism has connections with contemporary thought as well as with older fashions. Hegel misconceived by the 'Anglo- Hegelians' as a subjectivist, a monist and a transcendent absolutist, 1-7 B Hegel a metaphysician only in the sense that he sees the facts of experience in novel 'lights', not in the sense that he seeks to go beyond them. The most complete liquidator of the Jenseitige. For Hegel, absolute spirit exists only in human experience. Hegel's concessions to religion misleading, 7-11 C The dialectical method recognizes that there are many alternative ways of categorizing experience, some more 'adequate' than others. Dialetical transitions are not cases of deductive entailment, hence it cannot be objected that they involve creative elements or are inspired by experience. The dialectic superior to the modern 'passage from the familiar to the familiar', 11-17 D Hegel is not a subjectivist. His idealism is teleological and includes elements of realism and materialism. Hegel's worst defect lies in the difficulty of his language, 17-24 FLEW, A. I Can an effect precede its cause? Symposium (with M. Dummett), Suppl. XXVIII (1954), pp. 45-62 Synopsis: A (1) Mr. Dummett raises our question in an artificial context, but it may also arise naturally, in the context of certain scientific enquiries, 45-6 B It is nevertheless a question about modifying the notion of cause, i.e. a conceptual question, 46-8 C Pro- posals such as Dummett makes must result either (a) in radical contradiction; or (b) in an attempt to pass off as a species of causation, something which is nothing of the sort, 48-9 D (2) Dummett accepts 'the ordinary Humean view of cause; a cause is simply a sufficient condition'. He argues that 'the relation can hold as well between a later event and an earlier, as between an earlier and a later'. But Hume's view of cause is, in very relevant respects, defective, 49 E (i) Hume presents 'cause' as an observer's, not as an experi- menter's or agent's, concept; 49-50 F thus (a) not noticing its diagnostic and contextual character; 50-2 G and (b) being led to ignore the difference between observational and experimental evidence, 52 H (ii) Hume's account of causal necessity is inadequate, 52-4 I In it (a) he is offering a phenomenalist analysis, confusing the meaning of causal propositions with the sum of all possible supporting evidence for them; 54-5 J and (b) 34</page><page sequence="39">FURLONG Flew, A.-continued this is concurrently presented as, and confused with, a speculative psycho-genetic account of the notions under analysis, 55 K (3) Failure to notice these weaknesses in Hume vitiates Dummett's entire argument. Our criticisms of Hume applied (i) to Dummett's treatment of the 'slugabed' example; 55-7 L (ii) to the superstitious paradox embodied in his examples of his new way not to pay old debts, and of the weather magician; 57-8 M (iii) to uncovering a set of parallel ambiguities in a series of semi-technical terms-'suffi- cient conditions', 'necessary condition', and 'determined'-which help to mask the crucial difference in meaning between causal propositions and Hume's phenomenalist analysis of them; 58-60 N and (iv) to related ambiguities in 'know' and 'remember', which tend to confusion between the logical possibility of a certain sort of pre-cognition, and a factual revelation of Oedipean helplessness, 60-2 FOOT, P. R. I When is a principle a moral principle? Symposium (with J. Harrison), Suppl. XXVIII (1954), pp. 95-110 Synopsis: A A preliminary discussion of the type of problem involved. Why are some questions of the form what is x? thought of as, especially, philosophers' questions? The contention, here, is that philosophers deal with a particular kind of difficulty, not with a particular kind of concept. The difficulty may arise in various ways, e.g. it may be generated by asking what is x? where this is not appropriate, 95-104 B Consideration of one particular problem about moral principles. A man may accept a rule of conduct, generalise it, recommend it to other people etc.; and this yet not be enough to show that what he is holding to is a moral principle. A rule such as 'don't walk on the lines of pavements', or 'don't wear bright colours' could not be a moral rule unless a special background is presup- posed, 104-5 C What background? The importance, in this context, of concepts such as honesty, sincerity, murder, stealing, ostentation, treachery, etc. Suggestion that without such concepts we would not be able to understand a man's moral judgments. We need to know how he sees the action or situation in question, 105-10 2 Moral beliefs, Vol. LIX (1958-59), pp. 83-104 Synopsis: A Much work in recent moral philosophy has been based on the following two assumptions: (1) that some individual may, without logical error, base his beliefs about matters of value entirely on premisses which no one else would recognise as giving any evidence at all, and (2) that, given the kind of statement which other people regard as evidence for an evaluative conclusion, he may refuse to draw the conclusion because this does not count as evidence for him, 83-4 B Assumption (1) depends on the belief that thinking a thing good, evaluation, commendation, etc. can be identified in isolation from any special range of objects. The parallel assumption shown to be false in the case of thinking a thing dangerous (cf. warnin') and being proud of something. A man can only be described as thinking dangerous something which he believes will cause injury or some other serious harm, and it is not open to him to choose what he will call injury or harm. With a special background any kind of action can be thought good, can be the subject of evaluation, can be commended etc., but without this background the description may not make sense. Ex- ample: a practice of always clasping and unclasping one's hands, 84-94 C Assumption (a) depends on the supposed logical gap between 'factual' and 'action-guiding' (e.g. evalua- tive) statements. Examination of the 'action-guiding force' of the word 'injury', to show that in spite of this the facts guarantee that any man has a reason (though not necessarily an over-riding reason) to avoid injury. The 'action-guiding force' of moral terms depends on a somewhat similar connexion with reasons for acting. Given the facts of human exist- ence, it can be shown that any man needs the virtues e.g. of courage, temperance, and prudence. The other cardinal virtue, justice, presents a more difficult problem; since justice is thought disadvantageous to the just man, it may seem that the same connexion could not be shown to exist between justice and the will. However, the case for the disadvantageous- ness of justice has not in fact been made out, 94-104 FURLONG, E. J. 1 Abstract ideas and images, Symposium (with C. A. Mace and D. J. O'Connor), Suppl. XXVII (1953), pp. 121-36 Synopsis: A Universals, in a 'moderate realist' sense, are unnecessary. Three arguments used in their defence: from recurrences, from resemblance and from our awareness of 'open classes', 121-3 B Recurrences. These can be described in 'similarist' terms, 123-8 C Resemblance. This is not a universal in the moderate realist sense, 128-9 D Open classes do not prove moderate realism. All the facts can be described in terms of similarity (or dissimilarity); and this terminology avoids the extravagances of either realism or a crude nominalism, 129-31 E Berkeley. He was not an 'imagist'. This view of universals is, at bottom, similarist in character, 131-6 35</page><page sequence="40">GALLIE Furlong, E. J.-continued 2 Memory and the argument from illusion, Vol. LIV (1953-54), pp. 131-44 Synopsis: A The argument from illusion. There are illusory phenomena of memory as well as of sense-perception. How do the two compare in this respect? 131-2 B Illusory phenomena of retrospective memory closely resemble those of sense-perception; they refute any naive-realist view which remains really naive, 132-5 C We may know that a certain past event occurred, just as we may know that a book or a pen is seen, without being naive realists, 136-8 D Yet, for retrospective memory as for sense-perception, a choice remains, between description in terms of image, and in terms of appearing. We tend to use the latter when memory seems to take us back into the past; and the former when it seems to bring the past up to us, 138-42 E Non-retrospective memory (remembering that, and remembering how) is also liable to illusion; yet there are cases of each, in which error is ruled out, 142-3 F Summary, 143-4 GALLIE, W. B. 4 Pleasure, Symposium (with G. Ryle), Suppl. XXVIII (1954), pp. 147-64 Synopsis: A Ryle's positive thesis appears to be virtually the same as the 'relational property' analysis of statements about pleasures, 147-8 B As such, the main objection to it lies in the existence of 'ostensibly-locatable bodily pleasures'. It is possible (and significant) to say that someone does or does not enjoy these, 148-50 C Nevertheless it is worth pursuing Ryle's suggestion that we should regard 'enjoyment' as a species of the poly- morphous notion of attending or giving one's mind to, 150-2 D Consideration of the 'rules of application' of words such as 'enjoy' and 'attend to'. Perhaps it is possible for philosophers only to tighten up the restrictive rules, 152-5 E Can enjoyment be regarded as a species of non-inquisitive, non-practical attention? Could anything count as enjoyment, unless it fell into this specification ? 155-60 F Is enjoyment the basic or simplest sort, of this specific kind of attention? 160-1 G Impossible to suggest sufficient conditions for any but the elementary 'locatable' pleasures, 161-4 5 Essentially-contested concepts, Vol. LVI (1955-56), pp. 167-99 Synopsis: A My use of any concept (e.g. in asserting 'this picture is in oils') is liable to be contested. But my conception, e.g. of this picture as 'a work of art' is what I am here calling 'essentially contested', 167-8 B Where concepts of the latter sort are (especially) to be found, 168-9 C How should the endless conflicts which they occasion be understood? 169-70 D An (artifical) example of such a concept, 170-1 E Suggested definition. One could call 'essentially contested' any concept the use of which conveys appraisal of some complex and valued achievement, which, initially, is variously describable, and which is 'open' to various lines of future development, 171-5 F Can it be objected that the conditions of a concept's being 'essentially contested', are conditions sometimes equally fulfilled by a merely confused concept? 175-6 G We may answer:-not if the concept is being used for an achievement which, further, (i) derives from an original exemplar, which in turn (ii) provided no general criterion marking an optimum of later development, to which the use of the concept should be restricted, 176-80 H Four live examples of essentially- contested concepts, separately considered, 180-8 I Bearing of these findings (i) on the view that only if a concept be not an essentially contested one, can contest about it be genuine; (illustration from the attitude-moralists); 188-92 J (ii) on the question how recognition of a concept as essentially contested will affect the polemics which the con- tinued use of the concept occasions; 192-4 K and (iii) on the leading concepts in ethics, 194-5 L These contentions are not (a) a disparagement of reason; 196 M nor are they (b) a relapse into (an objectionable) historicism, 196-9 GARDINER, P. L. 1 On assenting to a moral principle, Vol. LV (1954-55), pp. 23-44 Synopsis: A Mr. R. M. Hare's analysis of 'sincerely assenting to a command' discussed and criticized, 23-8 B Connection between Hare's analysis of sincere assent to a command and his analysis of similar assent to a moral judgment or principle, 28-9 C Examination of different types of case in which a man may be described as having acted against his professed moral beliefs: cases of unconsciousness, self-deception, etc., considered together with cases of conscious wrong-doing, 29-37 D Problems raised by border-line cases, and cases of moral conflict or crisis, 37-40 E Motives underlying the view that a man can only be said sincerely to believe that he ought to do something if, when the occasion arises for doing it, he does it, 40-2 F Concluding appraisal of this view, 43-4 GEACH, P. T. 1 On what there is, Symposium (with A. J. Ayer and W. V. Quine), Suppl. XXV (1951), pp. 125-36 Synopsis: A 'How can you even refer to what does not exist and say it does not exist?' 125 B The conventional answer is that existence is not a predicate. This is right if glossed as 36</page><page sequence="41">GEACH Geach, P. T.-continued meaning that the ostensible subject of 'exist' is not a logical subject. In fact it is logically a predicate, predicated negatively; and such predicates need not be true of anything, 125-6 C Quine states this solution obscurely, by talk about 'denoting', 127 D The solution does not apply to such a case as 'Pegasus does not exist', 127 E Quine holds an extreme form of Russell's theory of descriptions-that all names are logically to be analysed away. Even if this were right, it would (as Quine recognises) make no difference to what there is, 128 F Quine thinks the referential function of names could be performed by pronouns like 'something' and 'everything', which have a studied ambiguity. Here he resembles other philosophers who regarded a different sort of pronouns (demonstrative) as the only genuine names. In fact no sort of pronoun is like a name; their functions are quite different, 128-30 G Neither the so-called variables in symbolic logic, nor variables plus the quantifiers that 'bind' them, have any reference to objects, definite or indefinite. The whole jargon about variables was rightly rejected by Frege as confusing, 130-1 H 'Something' has the same logical job as 'exists': ens et aliquid convertuntur. This job is to make a statement about what a (first-level or ordinary) predicate stands for-we may call 'something' or 'exists' a second-level predicate (sic), 131-2 I Quine does not want to admit that first- level predicates do stand for something. (Of course, since they are not names it is best not to say they name something). But if A and B are both red, there is something that A and B both are, and 'red' stands for this. To add (as Quine thinks we ought to, if we say this) 'and this is an abstract object' is nonsensical, 132-4 J Ontological disagreements still come out even if we talk about language, 134-5 K They are utterly unlike scientific disagreements, since the parties to them cannot even agree concerning what they are disagreeing about. They arise because one or another party is giving a muddled philo- sophical account of fundamental notions like existence, truth, thing-property. It is not, as Quine thinks, a matter of free choice whether we use these notions in our discourse, 135-6 2 Form and existence, Vol. LV (1954-55), pp. 251-72 Synopsis: A Preamble, 251 B (I) Logical predicates, besides being true or false of things, stand for something, 251-3 C It is of what they stand for that many-ness is asserted, when it is asserted; and many-ness cannot significantly be asserted of anything else, 253-4 D This was recognised by Frege as well as Aquinas. Contrast between this and the Platonic doctrine of 'one over against many', 254-5 E To avoid the Platonic mistake we must note that, although we can get reference to a form into the subject-place, using an abstract noun, this noun cannot be the whole of the subject, 255-6 F Both 'the wisdom of' in 'the wisdom of Socrates' and 'is wise' in 'Socrates is wise' are designations of a certain form, but they designate it differently, 257-9 G The wisdom of Socrates is not a form simpliciter, but is a form of or in Socrates; we may call it an individualised form. (Cf: 2 is not identical with the square root function, but is identical with that function of 4). Latin grammar made it almost impossible for Aquinas to state this point accurately, 259-60 H Such statements in Aquinas as Deus est ipsa sapientia must not be read Platonically, but as meaning e.g. that God is identical with that by which God is wise, 260-1 I The form of question 'is x itself that by which x is F?' is significant.

XXX (1956), pp. 59-73 Synopsis: A The law may be taken as relating to predicates or to whole statements; the former acceptation of it is historically the earlier, and it is the simpler to grasp, 59-61 B 'False' can be explained as 'having a negation that is true'; negation cannot be explained in terms of falsehood; so the law in its fundamental form does not contain the term 'false', 61 C Why can we not apply the law, if 'every man' is taken as the common subject of con- tradictory predicates? Because 'every man' is itself rather to be regarded as a predicate, which must be negated to 'not every man' in order to get a genuine pair of contradictory statements; 'every man' is neither a name of every man (beside his own proper name), nor the proper name of an abstract being-Everyman, 61-3 D The law is not a substantial premise in arguments, although it is rhetorically used as if it were, 63 E The model of a frontier-line drawn on a globe, shows that negation is a symmetrical relation between predicates. The negation of a predicate is not less sharply defined than the predicate is, and neither of the contradictories is logically prior to the other; nor need negative predictions be backed by affirmative ones. A doubly negated predicate has the same sense as the original predicate, 63-6 F The law of excluded middle follows from the laws of contradiction and double negation, together with a de Morgan law (that we may 37</page><page sequence="42">GELLNER Geach, P.

This holds even in some three-valued logics, 66 G The attempt to allow exceptions to the law as regards future contingencies was not, as some suppose, made by Aristotle, and cannot be successful in three-valued logics either, 66-7 H Alleged cases in which contradictory predicates (e.g. 'hungry', 'not hungry') both 'presuppose' a third predicate (e.g. 'animal')' so that where it does not apply, neither contradictory applies: these can always be got over by a slight artificial change of our language. These cases are no grounds for asserting a category- difference between the pre-supposing and the pre-supposed predicates, 67-8 I Logical paradoxes are cases in which contradictories are mutually inferrible given certain further assumptions; if we reject these assumptions we avoid the necessity of either rejecting formu- lae as nonsense or allowing exceptions to our law. (There are, however, puzzling cases in which contradictory statements seem to be actually synonymous), 68-70 J Type- distinctions can be established without dubious arguments to the effect that certain ex- pressions must be nonsense; a type-distinction is a way of disallowing, not of allowing, exceptions to the law of excluded middle, 70-1 K The only case in which it might be positively advantageous to allow exceptions to the law, is in constructing a logic of vague terms (one such as would not itself be vague), 71-3 4 Entailment, Symposium (with C. Lewy and J. Watling), Suppl. XXXII (1958), pp. 157-72 Synopsis: A (I) THE LOGICAL MAKE-UP OF ENTAILMENT-STATEMENTS. An entailment-statement is built up out of two statements-an antecedent and a consequent, 157 B Quine's mistaken view that the antecedent and the consequent should stand in quotation marks, 157-8 C The form 'the proposition that p entails the proposition that Q': this does not force itself upon us. We might have revived an obsolete conjunction and used the form 'an if p then q', 158-9 D Are we justified in using Eigennamen of the form 'the proposition that p'? 159 E What justifies us in using Eigennamen of the form 'the number of F's', is that we can state (in purely logical terms) a criterion for identity of numbers without presupposing the concept of number, 159-60 F But an analysis, in logical terms, of 'the proposition that p is the same proposition as the proposition that q', (not presupposing the conccpt proposition) is as yet not available. Mutual entailment, we shall see, is not yet a workable criterion, 160-1 G In the main part of my paper I avoid the term 'proposition' and Eigennamen of the form 'the proposition that p'. My standard form of entailment-statement is '(Russell is a brother) entails (Russell is male)', where 'entails' is logically a conjunction and the brackets are inserted mnerely for ease of reading, 161 H (II) LEWY'S FIRST PARADOX. Formal statement of the paradox and of the inter- pretations of the symbols, 161-3 I The force of 'a brother is a male sibling' when this expresses a conceptual analysis. It is not a statement about English usage, 163 J It is thus necessary that Russell is a brother, if and only if Russell is a male sibling; and even necessarily necessary that nobody is a brother who is not male, 163-4 K The truth- conditions of entailment-statements, in terms of apriori ways of getting to know things: this is a modified form of von Wright's theory, 164-5 L It would be possible but silly to object that this involves a reification of 'ways of getting to know things', 165-6 M Some obvious examples of true entailment-statements, 166 N Some possible theories about entailment, 166-7 0 It follows that entailment is not unrestrictedly transitive. This is paradoxical only in the sense of being surprising; and we can see why, in the particular examples Lewy gives, the result must hold, 167-9 P But valid proof is unrestrictedly transitive. Confusions that may hinder our seeing this, 169-70 Q If it is necessary that p and contigent that q, we may very well have: p entails (p and q); (p and q) entails q; p does not entail q, 170 R Lewy has shown that the mutual-entailment criterion of proposi- tional identity will not work; 170-1 S unless we are prepared to say very odd things about the conditions for two statements' expressing the same proposition, 171 T I am inclined to accept a simplified form of this paradox, which uses the (arguable) idea that a strict tautology cannot stand as antecedent or consequent of a true entailment-statement, 171-2 U The result is that not only mutual entailment, but even one sentence's serving to analyse what another says, fails as a criterion of porpositional identity. In this quandary we do well to reject the concept of 'the same proposition' as useless, 172 GELLNER, E.

Both types appeal to 'free- dom', 166-7 K Kant argues that only an action undertaken out of consideration of its deducibility (or the deducibility of its maxim) from an open rule escapes being part of nature and so un-free, 167-8 L But, so far from being able to say, in a given situation, that one and only one command has the required form, we can, in that situation, find the form required, in any command or in none, 169-71 M Two current ways, both insuffi- cient, of evading this criticism, 171-2 N The source of the Kantian recommendation, in a type of valuation which seeks to be, but cannot be, entirely purged ofempirical reference, 172-4 0 The existentialist finds the 'freedom' which is the justification for evaluations, in such evaluations as cannot be deduced from any formal rule, 174-6 Q Modem existentialism as a regretful acknowledgment of the absence,-rather than, like Kierke- gaard's, a militant protest against the supposed presence,-of universally valid principles, 176-7 R If in view of the failure, for opposite reasons, of both the existentialist ideal and the Kantian, a case should lie, for approximating one or the other as nearly as may be, it would seem to be a case not susceptible of decision upon any visible principle-a cir- cumstance perhaps favouring the existentialist, 177-8 2 Explanations in history, Symposium (with P.

It is here contended that this argument is plausible, only if those generalisations need to be regarded as disguised linguistic recommendations, and this is doubtful, 83-7 B Descartes' problem about whether we are always dreaming.

It is because in these cases there are many rules for their use, and there is a consequent temptation to over-simplify them as univocal terms.

But in a certain sense it may still be argued that they are unquestion- able, 104-6 C Since it is impossible even for the sceptical egoist to ask moral questions without himself assuming moral principles, no direct attack by him on the moralist is possible; 106-9 D though the sceptical egoist is not therefore necessarily irrational; and there is no possible contradiction between mere prudence and morals, 109-12 E The sceptic can indeed point to fundamental disagreements between those who accept some moral principles and those who accept others but different, 112-16 F Nevertheless the principle of rational benevolence may be held to be unquestionable, in a context where we are talking morals and being as rational as possible; if so it must be regarded as a principle necessary to the possibility of the most rational morality, 116-19 G Fundamental moral principles are not axioms of moral systems but principles of relevance; they are even given facts, necessary, but not sufficient, to moral judgment, 119-24 HAAS, W. 1 On speaking a language, Vol. LI (1950-51), pp. 129-66 Synopsis: A Ordinary language has system and structure, but it has no logical structure.

'Final' 40</page><page sequence="45">HAMLYN *Haezrahi, P.-continued goodness in aesthetics as a tacit assumption underlying our interest but not fruitful in concrete applications; e.g. the case of the 'classical canon of beauty'. The 'instrumental' goodness of aesthetics concerns ethics, psychology, etc. The distinction between the aesthetic and the natural qualities is always definite; e.g. compare the aesthetic (musical) surprise in Haydn's symphony of that name, with natural surprise. So the question of how to determine the aesthetic value of a 'kind' is not soluble by changes in the 'mode' of good, and therefore, in the last instance, not soluble by an analysis of aesthetic propositions, 186-90 J New start: in which we pass from the question of what certain propositions must mean 'if' they are made, to the insight that they are in fact constantly made. But when people say 'this is beautiful', this utterance is not necessarily a proposition; case (i) it may simply mark the occurence of an aesthetic experience; case (ii) it may express subjective satisfaction at this occurence; case (iii) it may be a pronouncement on the value of the object of this experience, 190-1 K Articulate and inarticulate forms of (i). Immediate aware- ness of the import of (i). As simply marking the occurence of an aesthetic experience, the phrase is (veraciously or otherwise) ejaculatory; and there can be no question of its correct- ness as a proposition, 191-3 L Even (ii) is an utterance not yet to be regarded as a proposition, 193 M (iii) A proposition; a reasoned judgment about the object's own aesthetic nature; the kind of claim tacitly acknowlfdged when, having conceded that the object is beautiful, I may have to add 'but I do not', (or be able to add 'and I do') 'respond to it'. The proposition reveals how our responses should go. Its truth makes a basis for training, 194-5 N Case (iii) can only be vindicated on the critical assumption of a pos- sible division into content and form (in works of art).

Hence after- images give no content to the notion of a visual field, in any ordinary sense of 'field', 114-19 E Is the visual field a field of sense-data? The characteristics attributed by Gibson to the visual field are all logically derivative from those attributable to the visual world. Gibson's terminology a special one, adopted for its usefulness in giving the phenomenology of a special view of the world. Difficulties of the notion that perception of the visual field is a primitive kind of seeing, 119-21 F This indicates that the sense-datum language (as a phenomenological terminology) is derived from language describing the perceiving of objects in the ordinary sense. The logical priority claimed for sense-data seems derived from the fact that the notion of sense-data is parasitical on that of sensations, 121-3 G The possibility of having sensations, as a necessary condition of perceiving. Yet perceiving is not merely the having of experiences, 123-4 H Sensation and perception. The importance of distinguishing between these concepts rather than look- ing for an analysis of experiences, 124 HAMPSHIRE, S. 4 Freedom of the will, Symposium (with W. G. MacLagan and R. M. Hare), Suppl. XXV (1951), pp. 161-78 Synopsis: A The rule of language 'ought implies can' is the condition of significance of prescriptive, and therefore general, utterances: they are pointless unless they satisfy this condition. The problem: to determine the relevant sense of 'can' and 'could', 161-4 B The determinist argues that 'can' and 'could', applied to human actions in the relevant sense, become obsolete, as scientific explanations of human conduct are discovered. The libertarian argues that explanation by natural law is not always and necessarily imcompat- ible with appeals to will and reason, which may themselves be causal factors. Ordinary language cannot here be decisive, 164-9 C 'He would have succeeded in doing x if he had tried' as condition of 'he ought to have done x'. Two methods of testing this proposition compared. 'You cannot do more than try' is a truism: but what is the test of 'try'? 169-72 D (i) The test by the subject, compared with (ii) the public tests, 172-5 E Moral prescriptions addressed to the will, the agency of trying. Such prescriptions must always be in place. The scientific explanations inform us of the obstacles to success: they do not set limits on the exercise of will, 175-8 HARE, R. M. 1 Freedom of the wi, Symposium (with S. Hampshire and W. G. MacLagan), Suppl. XXV (1951), pp. 201-16 Synopsis: A 'Ought implies can' marks a feature of all prescriptive language, i.e. of all judgment whose function is either (i) to give advice or guidance where there is a choice to be made, or (ii) to pass judgment upon a choice which has been made, 201-2 B Distinc- tion, within this class of judgment, between singular imperatives, universal ougt-sentences, singular present-tense ought-sentences and singular past-tense ought-sentences, 202-5 C All these kinds of judgment have relevance, only where a question of the form 'what shall I do?' has, or has had, to be answered. The last three, unlike the first, are used only where the advice, etc. is based on the fact that the circumstances in which the question arises are of a certain kind; i.e. they are used for giving general advice about a class of circumstances. The last two do this by instantiating the advice with reference to particular examples, 205-6 D Prescription. This not the same as causally affecting a person's behaviour. Thus the word 'advise' and similar telling-to words, differ logically from 'persuade' and similar getting-to words. 'Advise' has performatory uses, 'persuade' not; 'persuade', unlike 'advise', is an achievement-word; advice is always some sort of communication by language, persuasion may be by non-linguistic means (e.g. torture); advice is addressed to man qua rational, persuasion not necessarily so; we can request advice, but not persuasion; and I can get a counter-suggestible person to do something by advising him to do the opposite- not so with persuasion, 206-9 E Parallel between the 'telling-to' versus 'persuading-to' distinction, and one between 'telling-that' and 'persuading-that'. In both cases, telling leaves the freedom of the hearer unimpaired, but persuading does not, 209-10 F Thus to say that moral judgments are prescriptive is not to say that their function is to persuade. Moral judgments, (also orders), leave the hearer's freedom to comply or not quite unim- paired, though if orders are coupled with threats or preceded by conditioning, the threats or the conditioning (not the orders by themselves) impair freedom. Moral judgments thus more like advice than like persuasion, 210-13 G Moral advice therefore appropriate only in cases where the question 'what shall I do?' arises.

M.-continued individual variables does not bring a maxim under type E, 295-300 B The second-order rule, that U-type maxims cannot contain individual constants, is itself formal (definitional); but the maxims themselves may have content (be synthetic) without ceasing to come under type U. They are framed in accordance with the second-order rule, not deduced from it. We have the responsibility of choosing between maxims (autonomy of the will), 301-3 C Does this make choice between maxims a matter of mere inclination, or arbitrary ? 303-4 D All moral uses of 'ought' involve a U-type maxim. This is true by virtue of the meaning of 'moral', 304-6 E Elucidation of meaning of 'involve': a judgment containing 'ought' is not a moral judgment unless the speaker is prepared to accept a corresponding maxim in which the individual constants have been replaced by predicate-constants and bound individual variables. If our language cannot supply such predicate-constants as are required for the maxim to be formulated, we can corn them by saying 'like a' where 'a' is an individual constant occurring in the original judgment, and then replacing 'like a' by an invented predicate. The question 'like a in what respect?' can be answered as exactly as the case requires, 306-8 F The alleged impossibility of describing individuals or formulating moral maxims applicable to them. No such thing as complete description; but we can describe as fully as we want to. Universality and generality distinguished, 308-12 HARRISON, J. 1 Utilitarianism, universalisation and our duty to be just, Vol. LIII (1952-53), pp. 105-34 Synopsis: A According to utilitarianism, the rightness of an act depends upon its conse- quences, 105-7 B However, we of;en judge an act not on account of its actual conse- quences, but on account of what would be the consequences if the performance of similar acts became general, 107-8 C Hume may have made this the basis of his distinction between benevolence and justice, benevolent acts having good consequences by themselves, just acts having good consequences only if performed sufficiently often, 108-13 D Mill, too, held that we had a duty to refrain from performing actions which would be injurious if generally practised, but, like other utilitarians, failed to realise that this is inconsistent with utilitarianism as usually stated, 113 E An action belongs to many classes. Which of these classes are we talking about when we say that we should consider what would be the consequences if actions of its sort (or class) were generally practised? We are talking about that class which is such that (a) making it more specific makes no difference to the goodness of the consequences of its general performance; (b) making it less specific does make such a difference, 114-16 F Since every action belongs to many classes there is no reason why a right action should not belong to a class of acts which would have bad consequences if generally practised; or why a wrong action should not belong to a class of acts which would have good consequences if generally practised; provided that their membership of such classes is shown to be irrelevant by criteria (a) and (b) above, 116-18 G The principle that we have a duty to perform or to refrain from performing actions because of the conse- quences of the general performance of acts of their sort, only applies to actions which are so interrelated that the performance of n such, produces either more or less than n times the good produced by the performance of one of them. This explains why omitting one act of justice may do good, but omitting all similar acts of justice does harm, 118-21 H We do not think that an act should be performed, however bad its consequences, because its general omission would be bad. We may omit an action which would have bad consequences, provided the total gain from omitting all actions having consequences as bad or worse, does not exceed the total loss from omitting them, 121-2 I Appealing to the consequences of the general performance of an action, enables us to explain why it is that, as Ross points out, we should not break a promise to bring about a small amount of good, but may do so to bring about a large amount, 122-3 J It also enables us to decide what to do when there is a conflict of duties, 124 K To one who held that it was permissible to do an action which would, if everybody did the same, have bad consequences, we could only say 'what would happen if everyone who thought his example would not be followed by others, did what you are proposing to do?', 125-7 L One may, however, perform an action which would have bad consequences if generally performed, provided one knows that it would not be generally performed. This is because no harm would result from everybody performing such actions, who knows others will not do the same, 128-30 M Ordinary utilitarianism is in a sense inconsistent, for it enjoins on me the performance of certain acts, on the ground that they have good consequences, though if everybody adopted my principle, harm would result. The view that my duty depends on what would be the consequences if every- body were to act like me, is not inconsistent in this way; and hence it is more Kantian than is ordinary utilitarianism, 130-4 2 When is a principle a moral principle ? Symposium (with P. R. Foot), Suppl. XXVIII (1954), pp. 111-34. Synopsis: A The main object of this paper is to discover to what conditions a principle must conform if it is to be capable of being a moral principle, 111-12 B These requirements 43 D2</page><page sequence="48">HART Harrison, J.-continued are formal in the sense that a principle may be a moral principle, whatever it enjoins, 112-14 C It must be possible for us to fail to act on a principle which we accept as a moral principle, 114-16 D Moral principles cannot be legislated, 116-17 E Moral principles are not rules of skill, though we need to be skilful in order to be properly moral, 117-18 F Moral principles cannot be hypothetical imperatives. Teleological moral principles are not hypothetical imperatives, 119-20 G The statement that ethical con- clusions cannot follow from factual premises is tautologous, if it is made part of the meaning of 'factual statement' that no ethical conclusions can be deduced from it; in which case nothing of importance follows from this statement, 120 H Moral principles need not be universal, but there must be some universal moral principles to justify every particular moral judgment; and it should be possible, though difficult, to discover what these are, 121-3 I Moral principles must be formulated without expressions which, like 'me' and 'the U.S.A.' are logically particular, 123-4 J Some moral principles are ultimate, others derivative. The derivative can be subsumed under the ultimate, by the mediation of a factual premise. Ultimate, but not derivative, moral principles apply indifferently to all times and all places, 124-5 K No moral principles can be deduced from the require- ments aforementioned; and my duty to be impartial and to treat people equally are no ex- ceptions to this, 125-6 L If a man's moral principles are erroneous, his departing from them may be praiseworthy, 126-7 M A number of conditions must be fulfilled before it can be said that a given person holds a certain principle as a moral principle, 127-9 N Thinking that a certain principle is obligatory cannot be defined in terms of successful behaviour, 129-30 0 Any satisfactory theory about moral principles must explain the distinction between rightly and wrongly accepting a principle as obligatory. One way of doing it would be to say that, when I make a moral judgment, I am not describing my emotions, but evincing them and exhorting other people to act in a manner such as that to which these emotions prompt me. My moral judgment is correct or incorrect according as these emotions are such as a knowledgeable and unbiassed observer would have, 130-4 HART, H. L. A. 3 Theory and definition in jurisprudence, Suppl. XXIX (1955), pp. 239-64 Synopsis: A (i) Though it is true that much legal reasoning does not consist in the subsump- tion of particular cases under clearly applicable rules, there is still a need for the analysis of specific legal concepts ('right', 'duty', 'corporate body'). Those do still present puzzles, even where the relevant legal rules are clearly applicable, 239-41 B (ii) Such analysis (a) is neutral as between the types of theory listed by Mr. Cohen; (b) is a logical inquiry, though not to be identified with modal logic; (c) differs from that definition of legal terms which is designed to teach the use of legal expressions (such as are found in text books); this because it is designed to dissipate perplexities which have arisen about expressions the use of which is well known, 241-3 C (iii) This philosophically interesting analysis cannot be defined as Mr. Cohen defines it, as being concerned with a certain class of concepts e.g. those belonging 'peculiarly and necessarily' to all developed legal systems. It is definable only by the type of perplexity it seeks to resolve. Examples of this are Maitland's perplexity about cor- porate bodies, and Hagerstr6m's concerning rights. (iv) It is necessary to distinguish (a) statements about a legal system (external statements) from (b) statements applying the rules of the system (internal statements). The clarification of (b) is a task for analysis, not to be identified with modal logic, 243-50 D (v) Mr. Cohen's criteria for identification of 'legal' as distinguished from other rules. These, though important, cannot be necessary conditions for the use of the term 'legal', 251-3 E (vi) Even though all legal rules have a penumbra of uncertainty, so that recourse is often had to controversial political or moral standards in applying them to particular cases, the analysis of legal concepts need not adopt or recommend any particular standard, but should state that they are used in this way, 253-7 F (vii) What is meant by 'vagueness' or 'uncertainty' of 'legal rules'? Examples of these, and of the manner in which courts reach decisions in applying them. Too simple to say, with Mr. Cohen, that the judge invokes 'politico-moral' principles. (viii) Complexity of judicial reasoning illustrated by detailed analysis of the English case, re Makein. The 'weighing' of a multiplicity of different factors is not adequately or clearly described as 'balancing social interests', 258-264 HARVEY, J. W. 4 An objective order, Suppl. XXIX (1955), pp. 1-24 Synopsis: A Preamble. A particular contemporary philosophical tendency, and how it bears upon two interests which have always been fundamental to philosophy, 1-2 B The intense preoccupation with language, is one of a group of present tendencies calculated to weaken the sense of an objective order, 2-6 C The stand-point which will govern the present discussion: that an objective order is encountered and acknowledged by us, both in our factual knowing and in our moral valuations, 6-7 D The tendencies under considera- 44</page><page sequence="49">HENDERSON Harvey, J. W.-continued tion, as they are manifested in discussions of some typical problems about knowledge. (i) Natural knowledge. Are so-called thing-statements 'reducible to' statements about sense data? And on what rests the epistemological priority which philosophers (e.g. Ayer) suppose the latter kind of statement to have over the former? 7-9 E How can we ac- count for the phenomena of action-reaction in an objective natural order (in Lockean language, how could we acquire the idea of power) without presupposing things? 10 F The tendencies under consideration, as they are manifested in discussions about know- ledge. (ii) Our knowledge of other minds. Here, are we not losing hold of our actual experience of the human world as in principle a shared world? Inferences (e.g. the argument from analogy) to the character of others' expenences presupposes knowledge of this shared- ness, 10-14 G Discussions about knowledge, (iii). Our knowledge of the past. Ayer and B. A. W. Russell cited to show what extremes of real paradox these tendencies en- courage us to sanction as nevertheless strictly logical; and what illuminating explanatory suggestions (e.g. some of S. Alexander's) they must treat as explaining nothing, 14-16 H As to the practice of stalking abstractions, it is perhaps permissible to ask which of two is the more serious fault, not to acknowledge reality where it is, or to impute the wraith of reality to some undeserving abstraction, 16-17 I These tendencies, as at work in the field of moral valuation. Ethical subjectivism as such. Its plain inadequacies, 17-20 J The effect upon ethics, of these linguistic-semantic tendencies, has probably been to foster and spread a characteristic already implicit in certain classical moral philosophies. Stoicism cited in support of this; and Kant, 20-2 K How their exaggerated emphasis upon the subjective point of view was calculated at once to facilitate the analyst's programme, and to receive a certain confirmation at his hands, 23 L The difficult ultimate question (hardly to be answered apart from the evidence of religion) as to how the two objective orders are related. The suggestion of religious experience, that the moral order is neither basically opposed to the natural, nor yet merged in it, 24 HEATH, P. L. 1 Intentions, Symposium (with J. A. Passmore), Suppl. XXIX (1955), pp. 147-64 Synopsis: A Preamble, 147 B To ask if an action is (or is not) intentional is not the same as asking what its intention may be. And even 'intentional' has two senses. Questions about intention arise from uncertainty regarding behaviour, and the need for moral or legal judgment thereon, 148-9 C 'Subjective' theories relate all uses of the term to supposed mental antecedents; 'objective' ones to the outward Gestalt of the action itself. Neither is satisfactory, 149-50 D The subjective view can explain responsible, non-deliberate action only by recourse to unconscious intentions or other questionable expedients. Nor does it give any proper account of unintentional action, 150-2 E It does, however, provide for a needed distinction between the professed intention of an action and its ap- parent 'intent', thereby making it possible for degrees of responsibility to be discriminated in accordance with desert. But this does nothing to support its claim to psychological realism, 152-3 F The objective theory is equally incapable of defining 'intentional'. Coherence of pattern in an action is no indication of this; nor its absence, of the reverse, 154-6 G As for the claim that the outward behaviour-pattern sufficiently indicates the nature of intention, this has no warrant either in legal practice or in the interpretation of documents; for, in both, intention is regularly distinguished from intent, except where circumstances make it needless or impossible to do so, 156-61 H The reason, in all such cases, is that intentions are sought in explanation of behaviour, not in order to describe it. Personal testimony is a common source of such explanations, though not an irrefutable one, 161-2 I The intentional-unintentional distinction must similarly be seen as a method of categorising behaviour, not of describing it-as e.g. attentive or intelligent. Its primary purpose is to impute responsibility to the agent, in so far as he is, or is not, conscious (in some sense) of the nature of his action and its likely results, 162-4 HENDERSON, G. P. 1 Intensional entities, and ontology, Vol. LVIII (1957-58), pp. 269-88 Synopsis: A The communication-process between human beings: description of it raises ontological issues. Generally speaking, to describe it as a series of sharings involves a richer ontology than does the description of it as a series of two-term transactions. The paper is to discuss, not the question whether any particular meaning-analysis involves 'intensional entities', but rather the metaphysical importance of allowing such entities in meaning- analysis, 269-71 B Which kinds (or kind) of intensional entity are we assuming (for the sake of argument) analysis to require? This does not greatly matter. Our interest is in propositions (Frege's 'thoughts'), 271 C Frege would show that thoughts 'are neither things of the outer world nor ideas'. But has he shown that analysis does more than postulate them; has he shown it to affirm them (as part of the furniture of the universe)? To ask this would (in Frege's language) be to ask if his expression 'thought' had sense but not reference. 45</page><page sequence="50">HEPBURN Henderson, G. P.-continued And the case against this is rested on the indispensability of 'thoughts' in meaning-analysis. A successful rival analysis must show equal or superior explanatory power. In this respect it does not appear that any alternative has yet won its spurs, 272-7 D A merely con- ventionalist use of 'thought' ('proposition') would have to be contrasted with Frege's. In particular, the mere use of bound variables, taking propositions as values, would have no ontological import, 277-81 E Granted that there are propositions, it is misleading to construe this as licensing the entry of an item in an inventory of descrete entities. We may regard the being of propositions as 'involved in' other kinds of being, 281-2 F Also, we may assimilate propositions to possibilities; and consider, on that basis, how far we can go in 'reducing' them to other kinds of being, 282-8 2 Is there only one correct system of modal logic ? Symposium (with E. J. Lemmon), Suppl. XXXIII (1959), pp. 41-56 Synopsis: A The thesis that there are a variety of correct systems of modal logic is less controversial than the ideas of (i) a 'normal', (il) a 'basic' modal logic, related to the idea of 'correctness', 41 B Granting that there are alternative modal logics, that they do not of themselves enable us to decide what interpretations they have, and that different subject- matters need different logics; still, a complete modal logic differs (i) from a geometrical system, and (ii) from each of the propositional calculi, classical and intuitionist. How they would differ, 41-4 C Mr. Lemmon discusses 'correctness' solely in terms of inter- pretation. This procedure obscures the possibility that the 'normality' of the systems he discusses may have something to do with their correctness, 44-5 D 'Normal' does not just mean 'usual'. Does a normal system contain all kinds of thesis, or only 'obvious' ones? Is normality a kind of a priori, self-revealing correctness? At least this correctness might be held to belong to what any 'normal' system must contain. The 'basic modal logic' of Lukasiewicz, 45-8 E Interpretation of 'basic modal logic'. In the BML. (basic modal logic) the 'L's' and 'M's' are already interpreted signs. Hence, for part of any modal system, the question of correctness is settled in advance. This is what appears to be meant by claims to the effect that the fundamental theses of the BML are acceptable to our logical intuitions, 48-52 F Difficulties considered:- (i) Are there interpretations of modal systems which do not take 'necessary' as a starting-point? (ii) Why are the characteristics making up 'normality' not purely and simply formal? (iii) There are modal idioms, but do modal theses in general, yield specific statements for which we have any use? 52-5 G Conclusion:- If we take seriously the notion of BML we should qualify Lemmon's thesis by holding that there are alternative 'correct' systems of modal logic, but that the correctness of certain theses in any modal system is not open to question, 55-6 HEPBURN, R. W. 1 Vision and choice in morality, Symposium (with I. Murdoch), Suppl. XXX (1956), pp. 14-31 Synopsis: A Not all moral agents see morality as the endorsing of rules or principles. Some see it as the realising of a pattern of life or the following out of a pilgrimage. Autobio- graphies in which the author's moral vision is buit up out of personal symbols, constituting a myth or 'fable' (e.g. Edwin Muir's), 14-16 B Problems which arise out of this ap- proach to morality: the relation between the aesthetic approach ('patterns', 'creativity') and the moral approach proper: what sense can be given to the quest for 'unity of being' or 'integration', which is a notable feature of the autobiographies discussed? 17-22 C The criteria invoked when judging the adequacy of a pattern or fable: coherence, comprehensi- veness, vividness of the symbolic material, compatibility with moral decisions. What sort of criteria are these? Directions in which patterns may degenerate: individuality becoming eccentricity; the aesthete's manipulation of other people; fables as screens against self- knowledge. 'Superficiality' here, 22-6 D The logical relations between accounts of morality as rule-obedience and as pattern-creation.

XXVIII (1954), pp. 197-218 Synopsis: A Our problem is the sensory vis a vis the interpretative, in perception, 197-8 B The current sense-datum account of the distinction seems to rest on a conception of sensing which is untenable, for (i) analysis of perceptual experience does not reveal in- corrigible awareness of an existent; 199-200 C (ii) illusions and hallucinations can be better explained on common-sense lines without postulating sense-data; 201-2 D and (iii) there are further objections to sense-data, e.g. from attention and publicity. The adverbial analysis of sensing does not provide an acceptable alternative, 203-5 E The view that so-called sense-datum theories are not theories but merely alternative languages, rests on too narrow a conception of what constitutes a theory; and it fails to realise the extent to which philosophies of perception disagree about the facts, 205-6 F The alleged sense- datum-language would have no advantage over ordinary, and could not do justice to the non-sensory activity in perceiving, 207-8 G The distinction sought is not revealed by mere inspection of perceptual consciousness, but rests on other evidence which must not be ignored. 'Interpretation' over-intellectualises non-sensory activities, but is traditional, and there is no good alternative, 208-10 H Distinction of sensing and 'interpretation' in perception may be supported by two arguments. First, and chiefly, that it is postulated to explain the difference between perceived and theoretically-apparent properties, of ob- jects revealed in attention; recognition, object-constancy, etc., 211-14 I Secondly, and more dubiously, it might be argued from physiology that, as it is really adverbial, the sensory experience caused in the percipient by external objects could not, without some form of interpretation, seem to him to be awareness of them, 214-16 J Neither argument justifies sensations or sense-data as private objects of awareness. The difference between sensing and observing suggested is one of mode of apprehension of external objects, 216-18 HOLLAND, R.

XXXII (1958), pp. 25-48 Synopsis: A Moore holds, in Principia Ethica, that good things are many and various but that the notion of 'good' is single and simple, 25-7 B This precludes the attribution, to anything, of a high degree of goodness of one kind, and a low degree of goodness of another kind.

Four main senses are distinguished here, one in each section of the paper, 313 B Expression as a process. Summary of the expressive process in the artist's mind, as given by Croce, Collingwood, William James, and 47</page><page sequence="52">ISAACS Hospers, J.-continued John Dewey. Four questions: (i) Is it always emotions that are expressed in art? (ii) Is expression the distinctive activity of artists qua artists ? The descriptions quoted in no way distinguish good artists either from bad artists or from creative scientists or mathematicians. (iii) Nor do the creative processes of admittedly great artists invariably follow the pattern described as 'the expressive process'. And (iv) in any case, what does it matter? The artistic product is what counts, not the process. This is often obscured by the use of the term 'expression' to stand for both the process and the product. Numerous illustrations establish this point. Even when critical discourse seems to refer to the process, (in speaking of an effect as 'forced', of a work as 'insincere', etc.) the context shows that it is the product and not the process which is being characterized, 313-24 C Expression as evocation. Numerous senses distinguishable under this heading. A work is said to be expressive of emotion E if (a) it evokes that emotion in a given listener or observer, or (b) evokes it in many or most observers, or (c) in most of the 'educated' (or some other) group of observers, or (d) if these observers are disposed to feel emotion E under specifiable circumstances; or (e) if they feel, not life-emotion E, but 'music-emotion' E (described); or (f) if they recognize the work of art as of a certain kind which sometimes, but not always, evokes E; or (g) if they imagine E; and so on. In all these cases the test of expressiveness is what an audience thinks or feels, 324-32 D It can be shown that the merit of a work of art does not depend, at least to any considerable degree, on the nature or kind of emotions evoked by it, 330-2 E Expression as communication. Perhaps it is not enough that the audience feel E; they must feel the same E that the artist felt upon creating the work-a 'transfer' of emotion from artist to audience. Critical examination of the various metaphors employed to describe this concept-'transmission', 'deposition', 'conveyance', 'communication', 332-40 F The communication-theory of art. Irrelevance of the question whether (and the epistemolo- gical difficulty of determining whether) the state of mind of the artist was similar to that of the audience, 336-40 G Expression as a property of the work of art. Difficulty of establishing any 'emotional' property in works of art, in view of the widely differing charac- terizations by trained critics. The only conclusion that seems to offer hope: namely, that, in saying that a work of art (objectively) expresses emotion E, we are saying that it has (objec- tively) certain characteristics in common with the facial expression, gestures, etc. of people who are experiencing emotion E, 340-4 ISAACS, N. 3 The temporal-correspondence approach to truth, Vol. LI (1950-51), pp. 47-82 Synopsis: A Aim of the paper: to present a correspondence-account of truth which will be fully viable against the usual philosophical difficulties. But that means first of all placing our naive common-sense view back in its proper psychic context, and studying it as an effectively functioning structure-and a structure in depth, 47-8 B This entials, inter alia, substituting a psycho-linguistic approach for our current logico-semantic one; with support from Russell's recent sharp contrast between mere 'sentential noises' and-those psycho- logical realities-the beliefs behind them, 49-51 C However, in attempting to get down to the simplest belief-forms ('I am hot', 'that is red', etc.) Russell in fact moves away from the setting in which our truth-falsity distinction most typically operates. For this we must turn to our actual experiences of correspondence, and above all of non-correspondence (clashes of beliefs with found facts). It is these contrasted experiences which give meaning to the truth-falsity antithesis, 52-3 D The surprisingly large number of different ways in which these experiences uphold the ordinary 'common sense' notion of truth, 54-8 E More systematic presentation of the case: (1) analysis of expectation-states as they actually function, 59-60 F (2) The basic pattern: (a) perceptual experience (b) expectation of further perceptual experience (c) the further perceptual experience which comes. The true core of the matter is temporal -the temporal comparison of 'expectation-' or 'belief-' states, with 'findings',-not the quasi-spatial comparison of 'thought' with a 'thing' or 'fact' confronting it, 61-2 G (3) Logical structure. How the experience 'here is S; S means P; now for P' turns into 'Some but not all S are P', 'S is sometimes P', 'Some S are P, but some are not', etc., 63-4 H (4) General pressure and guidance towards a develop- ing working logic. Main broad schema of cognitive development, 65-9 I Answers to questions: (1) what if the expectation or belief refers to a feeling state? Answer, it is verified or falsified in exactly the same way, 70-1 J (2) Is not the relationship between previous beliefs and 'findings' much more complex than has been represented? Answer, very often, yes. But always the actual finding is final, once its character has been clearly established, 71-3 K (3) Inter-personal situations: these present no special problem, 73 L (4) A more serious question, which has probably played no small part in turning belief-analysis into semantic, noise-sign analysis. Is not this account (even more than Russell's) com- mitted to images, or at least to representations? Some key considerations which show that this difficulty, however real and important, is not an ultimate one, 74-6 M (5) Some wider questions. Beliefs about the past, about the remoter future, and about the inaccessible present. 77-8 N (6) It has been suggested above that expectation-situations contain all 48</page><page sequence="53">JONES Isaacs, N.-continued the main elements of a syllogistic logic. But is not this analysis thereby self-confined to the most rudimentary levels of thought? Has it any relevance to modem relational and mathematical logistics? A two-fold reply, 79-82 JONES, J. R. 1 Self-knowledge, Symposium (with T. R. Miles), Suppl. XXX (1956), pp. 120-42 Synopsis: A (I) There is a sense in which 'self-words' have a meaning for their users, in a given context, which they cannot have for hearers of their use. Could neglect of this distinction be the 'deeper' error of philosophical behaviourism? 120-1 B In reducing statements about people's minds to statements about their bodily behaviour, may not the behaviourist be using expressions like 'my body', 'my behaviour' as if they had only the meaning they have for you when I use them ? Its claim (philosophical behaviourism's claim) is conceded, however, that if I do understand them differently it is not because there exists a class of privately witnessable happenings. The difference lies rather in the fact that being the user of self-words involves the occupation of an unshareable point of view, 121-3 C (II) A 'point of view' consists of a union of sense-fields of which one, the somatic sense-field, constitutes the 'occupant' of the point of view. Thus (say) the visual field on its own would be simply 'seen'. For it to be possible to say 'I see them', the sense fields must stand in an undefinable relation to my somatic sense-field. And since this is the modality in which I am apprised of a certain physical body, this body, which is what you take 'I' to mean when you hear me mutter it, will also be what I mean by it; except that what is thus in both our minds will be known to me from an internal point of view which you cannot share, 123-7 D (III) Awareness of somatic data is 'feeling'. 'Feel' combines the functions of a 'being'-verb or 'state of being'-verb, with a 'being aware'-verb. Feelings, therefore, are unwitnessable, for I only witness being that is discontinuous with my own. To know that one is in pain, nothing has to be observed. One has only to be 'in pain'. This is a clue to the nature of self-knowledge, 127-9 E (IV) It is senseless to suppose I have criteria by which I know that I am in pain. Do not I have to identify it as pain? But my identifying is already part of my having it. I do not find out its identity. So it cannot seem to me that I am in pain. This is the language of 'witnessing' and I do not witness my pain; I have it. And I know that I have it from having it. I know it because pain is at once a 'way of being' and a 'way of being aware', 129-33 F (V) can this be extended to other 'psychological verbs'? How do I know (e.g.) that I am remembering? 'I' refers to a certain physical body. But if your view of this body is substituted for mine, the 'I' which does things like remembering must withdraw from the shared world and become a 'mind' lodged 'within' this body which you perceive. When the question of self-knowledge is then raised, this picture misdirects attention in- wardly, and it is thought that in order to know that e.g. I am remembering, I must introspect some inward process. So has been intruded the model of the mind as a ghostly void within which queer goings-on are privately witnessable. Its effect is to obscure the clue which feeling holds to the nature of self-awareness, 133-9 G (VI) Knowing I have pain is the same thing as being in pain. This is why I have no way of knowing that I have pain. Similarly, I have no way of knowing that I am remembering. I know it from remembering. In general, I know what I am doing ('mentally') not by introspection but from doing it-just as I know what I am saying (aloud) not from listening to what I am saying but from saying it, 139-42 2 The two contexts of mental concepts, Vol. LIX (1958-59), pp. 105-24 Synopsis: A The use of language presupposes a distinction of two 'comprehension-situations', that of the user of an expression and that of hearers of its use, 105 B The 'two contexts (of the title) are the corresponding contexts of comprehension entered, by the meaning of an utterance as comprehended, respectively, by user and hearer. Does the proposed re- allocation of mental concepts (by Ryle and others) under the categories of overt expression and behaviour, entail neglect of this distinction? 105-6 C To test this, on concepts which have a reference to situations, and which have a role, therefore, in the explanation of behaviour, an investigation of emotion, as exemplified in anger, is here undertaken, 107 D (I) Much is merely contingent to 'being angry at a time' which, on one view or another, has seemed a necessary ingredient of it. To take the traditional view-that a specificfeeling of anger is necessarily ingredient. Not only can there be cases of being angry where no anger is felt, the feelings that may be felt in being angry are not intrinsically feelings of anger. Some, or all, of them may occur in connexion with other emotions. They do not 'arrive hall-marked anger', 108-9 E Nor could the feelings he registers shed any light on whether a man is being reasonably angry. This question is only settled in the light of the situation which provoked his anger, and feelings have no reference to situations except extrinsically-as embedded in the ways in which we become involved with the world. Thus feelings do not explain or justify. They receive explanation and justification from the larger, 49</page><page sequence="54">KEENE Jones, J. R.-continued 'intentional' complexes which they enter, 109 F Ryle, rejecting the traditional view, construes 'being angry at a time' as a short-term liability-condition, exercised contingently in a felt turbulence but more significantly, because necessarily, in the current overt be- haviour of the angry person. But is any piece of behaviour any more necessarily, because internally, connected with anger, than a given feeling or sequence of feelings? For the bare description of such behaviour, a reference to anger would be unnecessary. But 'he is angry' is an interpretation, not a description, of what a man is seen doing, 110-11 G How s it then that one ordinarily has no difficulty in identifying angry behaviour? It is the sur- roundings of the behaviour which furnish the missing 'hall-mark'. What we observe that is specific to the angry man's condition, and therefore a clue to it, is his overt behaviour seen in the light of the situation in which he is placed. It is thus as parts of a larger logical whole, that both covert feeling and overt behaviour acquire their specific connexion with anger. And, logically central to this whole, is the situation of the angry person, 112-13 H But, to understand the (logical inwardness of the situation of the) beingangry, a user's as opposed to a hearer's viewpoint must be taken up. A factor then appears, which turns the texture of outer situation and circumstance into an inner texture of one's anger. This factor is one's involvement in the situation, one's 'engagement' in it, 114 I Does the being angry then slip back into the same covert context as the feelings felt in being angry? Not in any such way as to make it an object of introspection. For we do not introspect our involvements in situations; that is not the direction in which situations lie. Yet, in any involvement, some- thing is being continuously lived-through from earlier to later time. This gives to all involvements a property of occurrent immediacy, 115 J (II) From the distinction Wittgenstein is said to have drawn between two senses of 'I', a sense in which 'I' is 'grammatically on a level with other people' and the sense in which it (obviously) is not, it follows that when I make an avowal of anger, there is some sense in which I am saying what you are saying when, with reference to me, you say 'he is angry'. For we are both in a sense referring to the same thing, namely, 'the involvement in this situation, of this angrily behaving body'. That is why there is one concept of 'anger' in language operating with the same meaning in both 'contexts of comprehension'. Neverthe- less user and hearer are radically differently related to the anger avowed by the former. For the 'I' of his avowal has a sense in which it is not on a level with 'he'; and, in that sense, it somehow has reference to the occurrent immediacy of his involvement in the situation. He speaks it from within his involvement. This entails that, whilst it can be said of you that you have criteria by which you tell that I am angry (for you note behaviour and a situation which shows this to be angry behaviour), it cannot be said that I have criteria. To suppose otherwise is to relate me to my situation and behaviour, as to a source of evidence for my being angry. And the whole meaning of involvement is that I come too close to both be- haviour and situation, for this to have sense, 118-22 K Yet Ryle assumes that the proof that feeling is peripheral to anger removes the last obstacle to my being related to my anger much as you are related to it. This supresses that part of the user's context of comprehension which does not coincide with the hearer's. When I say 'I am angry', there may be a level to the grammar of this, where it means the same as 'he is angry'. But if I am placed in your relation to my anger, it is as if I were actually saying 'he is angry' and implying no more by this than you mean by it. At once, then, the deep grammar of the distinction of persons in language goes to pieces, 122-4 KEENE, G. B. I Randomness, Symposium (with G. S. Brown), Suppl. XXXI (1957), pp. 151-60 Synopsis: A Summary statement of what is to be argued in the paper. A subject, in his account of which, my fellow-symposiast seems to me mistaken-prediction, 151-4 B To predict by chance is simply to predict without justification, 154-6 C There can be no such thing as a perfect baffling-machine (i.e. one which baffles all of the people all of the time); nor can any be guaranteed to baffle all attempts at grounded prediction, 156-7 D But, assuming that a random series is one produced by a machine which, in fact, baffles all attempts at grounded prediction, there are series which, for practical purposes, may properly be called 'random'; 158-9 E for, once it is admitted that the concept of 'randomiser' is an impirically testable concept, anyone who predicts 0 as the next member of the series 0/0/0/0/ . . . can claim to be basing his prediction on (extremely weak) inductive grounds (thereby disclaiming bafflement) only if he has no reason to suppose that the series is being produced by a randomiser. If he knows that it is being so produced, he knows that there is adequate empirical evidence for believing that no digit will occur rather than any other. In that case his prediction is mistakenly grounded; and it is, therefore, a chance prediction, 160 F For different experiments, different finite sections of an infinite random series are required, -or, more precisely, have to be excluded. But they are not excluded on the grounds of lacking random parentage. They are excluded because they have a pattern which is significant with respect to the experiment in question, 160 50</page><page sequence="55">KNEALE KNEALE, M. 2 What is the mind-body problem?

(This ex- pression is preferable to talk of consciousness, because it does not suggest a kind of know- ledge), 3-6 D Why are Locke and many other philosophers anxious to describe what we thus live through as if it were something apprehended by an inner sense? 6-7 E Certain linguistic usages may have suggested it, but a more important source is the attempt to give ourselves an account of our knowledge of self, on the same principles as we use in talking about our knowledge of the external world, 7-10 F Three mistakes which arise from this doctrine of introspection, 10-11 G First, a confusion of dispositions with experiences, e.g. of belief with thinking, 11-13 H This is to be found in many moral philosophers, in their discussion of attitude, 13-14 I While we try to do justice to what has been sald recently of dispositions, we should not suppose that psychology can dispense with talk of experiences, 14 J From the same doctrine arises, secondly, the mistake of supposing that knowing is a special kind of experience. When I say that a man noticed (saw, recognised, realized, found) that p, my words do not describe an experience different from thinking, but convey the implication that he had sufficient reason for thinking as he did, 15-16 K Application of this, to the process of gaining knowledge of our own experiences, and to the process of deductive inference, 16-20 L Since the essential feature in the use of the word 'know' is that the speaker endorses the thinking of the person to whom he attributes the knowledge, the meaning of the word is not inseparably connected with the applications of it, 20-2 M A third mistake arising from the same source is the mistake of assuming a detailed parallelism between introspection and perception, 22-3 N Four distinguishable uses of the word 'see', and their relations to experience, 23-7 O The task undertaken in this paper is a necessary preliminary to descriptive psychology and so to the study of many of the questions traditionally assigned to philosophy, 28 51</page><page sequence="56">KNEEBONE KNEEBONE, G. T. 1 Induction and probability, Vol. L (1949-50), pp. 27-42 Synopsis: A There is general agreement on the mathematical calculus of probabilities, but not on the interpretation of the formalism, 27 B Two main types of theory. The a priori theories (Keynes, Jeffreys) attempt the impossible, in trying to formalise what is primarily a matter of individual judgment. The a posteriori theories (von Mises, Reichen- bach) begin correctly, in defining probability by reference to frequency, but they fail to explain how theoretical probabilities are related to empirical frequencies. These theories are also incapable of justifying predictions based on knowledge of probabilities, 28-31 CThe problem: to construct an inductive frequency theory of probability, which recognizes that probabilities are derived from emporical data by an inductive inference, 31 D Discussion of induction. The inductive inference draws a conclusion from certain specific data set against a unity of experience, i.e. the whole background of knowledge and the conceptual frame presupposed by the person making the inference. Consequently we cannot consider inductive inferences hypothetically, 32-5 E Theory of probability. Division into mathematical and pre-mathematical parts. Probability to be treated as an 'idealised' fre- quency. The degree of rational belief yielded by an inductive inference, to be called 'likeli- hood'. Likelihoods not measurable, 36-7 F A proposition may have likelihood; an event, probability. An event is described by an ordered pair of proposition-schedules (0, P). A schedule is a proposition which is incomplete in that the time and place to which it refers are not specified. An 'event' can therefore have many realizations. Its probability is p if we are able to infer, inductively, that it is likely that in any long random sequence of trials, the frequency of success will approximate to p, 37-41 G The inductive frequency theory involves an inductive characterization of 'randomness', put forward as an improve- ment on von Mises's contradictory Regellosigkeit, 41 H The probability of an event (0, P) belongs to this event as a type, not to any particular sequence of trials. Predictions can therefore be based on it, 42 2 Abstract logic and concrete thought, Vol. LVI (1955-56), pp. 25-44 Synopsis: A In this paper, logic means the branch of philosophy which treats of the struc- ture and the cogency of thought.

Abstract thinking can be confined within the realm of con- cepts (it is then analytic) or directed towards experience (as in discussion of an abstract model of a range of scientific phenomena).

In these examples, from a given proposition which is true it is argued that another proposition is also true, because the two are similar in linguistic form, and some term or terms appear in both, 194-6 F Of the four kinds of example, three are as follows. Given a true proposition, we go on to a second proposition which (i) is both true and similar in form to the first; (ii) is true but different in form to the first; (iii) is similar in form to the first but yet false, 196-7 G (IV) The use of the examples in- tended by the author is primarily a practical one, viz., that of maintaining the Mohist position against the objections of opponents, as in examples (3), (2A), (e), (f). The method of parallel used by opponents, is shown not to be a sound method of reasoning, as obviously false propositions can be derived from true ones by using the same method, and also obviously true propositions can be derived by going against this method, 197-200 H (V) Some of the examples are not connected with the nature of the Chinese language, 200 I But this most of the examples are, at least in part. The Chinese language lacked indication of grammatical categories. As a result, sentences which are apparently similar in form are much more numerous than in an inflected language. This makes the work of analysis much more difficult, since the logician cannot (i) make use of morphological features in his analysis; (ii) take a word out of its context for discussion, without its becoming gram- matically indeterminate. Logic, in other words, could not look to grammar for help; because grammatical analysis was rendered, by the same factor, equally difficult, if not more so, 201-3 J Grammatical distinctions do not, of course, always accord with logical distinctions; but grammatical distinctions in languages in which they can be readily made, are of great help to the development of logic, at least in its initial stages, 203-4 LAZEROWITZ, M. 1 The paradoxes of motion, Vol. LII (1951-52), pp. 261-80 Synopsis: A The flying-arrow paradox. How are this and the other paradoxes of Zetio to be interpreted? Does he here (i) argue mistakenly for a factual statement, one which is false? or (ii) argue correctly for a factual truth (that motion is impossible)? or (iii) demonstrate, not the impossibility of motion, but the real nature of it (Cf. Russell)? or (iv) reflect a fault in ordinary language? None of these interpretations will do, 261-4 B Analysis of the argument "that since motion implies change of position in the now (in an instant), which is impossible, motion is impossible." Neither premise nor conclusion here is empirical. The premise, 'chage of place in an instant is impossible', is not an empirical statement but an a priori truth guaranteed by the linguistic fact that 'change of place in an instant' describes no conceivable occurrence. And the conclusion, despite appearances, is also not empirical; for, since nothing conceivable would be accepted as an instance of motion, Zeno's conclusion asserts no condition of things which might be otherwise. Nor does taking the argument to show "that motion consists merely in the occupation of different places at different times" (cf. Russell) explain the nature of the phenomenon, since no conceivable pheno- menon, it is implied, would answer to the description 'is in a process of transition', 264-9 C But neither is 'motion is impossible' a priori, else it would have a linguistic correlate to the effect that the word 'motion' lacks a use. Since Zeno's proof cannot seriously be interpreted to have this obviously false consequence for everyday language, how is the proof to be interpreted? The hypothesis advanced here is that while 'motion is impossible' does not express an a priori proposition in our language, it is made to do so by Zeno in an artificial 55</page><page sequence="60">LEJEWSKI Lazerowitz, M.-continued philosophical language, and this for the purpose of dispensing with the word 'motion'. The proof is viewed as expressing a linguistic grievance against the use of the word 'instant': this word, by functioning grammatically as a name for a time-interval (for 'motion implies change of place in an instant' implies that an instant has duration), creates the semantic illusion of denoting a minute duration-an illusion, because nothing can change place in an instant. An unsatisfactory linguistic situation has been remedied by making 'motion is impossible' express a logical necessity. Acceptance or rejection of Zeno's proof rests, not on a decision as to its logical validity, but on one's satisfaction or dissatisfaction with present language. In terms of the hypothesis here submitted, various attitudes are explained: (i) acceptance of proof and conclusion by those aggrieved over the presence in language of a time-unit substantive ('instant') which does not denote a duration, (ii) rejection of both by those not disturbed linguistically, (iii) interpretation of the proof as an explanation of motion by those sufficiently attracted by the syntactically name-like use of 'instant' to re-define 'motion', 269-75 D The other Zeno paradoxes. The stadium inveighs, in a linguistically-concealed way, against the use of 'instant' to denote a time-span; the Dicho- tomy and the Achilles inveigh against the linguistic exaggeration of the similarity between infinite and finite series; and in a concealed way they propose altering the use of the term 'series'. In asserting the logical impossibility of completing an infinite geometrical series, they create a language in which the word 'series' is so contracted as to apply only to what are normally called finite series, 275-80 LEJEWSKI, C. 1 Proper names, Symposium (with P. F. Strawson), Suppl. XXXI (1957), pp. 229-56 Synopsis: A The paper is largely devoted to the problem of the distinction between subject- expressions (or arguments) and predicate-expressions (or funtors). It begins with a discus- sion of the Aristotelian doctrine of predicability. As a next step two different methods of analysis of simple propositions, syntactical and semantical are outlined, 229-31 B In the method of individual names, it is shown how a syntactical and semantical theory could be built up by starting with the concepts of truth and falsehood and the semantical relation of designating, 231-9 C In the generalised method, use is made of a more comprehensive relation of naming. By the aid of this semantical equipment, other concepts required for the semantical analysis of the constituent parts of simple propositions are introduced, 239-47 D In particular, it is shown that, within the framework of either method, functors which correspond to predicate-expressions can be classified into unshared, shared, and fictitious, in analogy with a similar classification of names, 234-5 and 241-4 E It is in the light of these two methods, that the traditional doctrine of predicability is subjected to re-examination. The characteristic feature of the two methods consists in the complete avoidance of any reference to entities other than individuals, 237-8 and 244-7 F A syntactical and semantical interpretation of the proposition 'man is a species' is suggested, with a view to showing that in ordinary language 'pseudo-names' often stand for functors. This, it is urged, accounts for the generally accepted semantical theories which presuppose the existence of entities other than individuals, 247-50 G A tentative definition of 'proper name' is offered, and expressions which appear to satisfy the demands of the defini- tion are adduced as examples, 250-1 H The paper ends with a discussion of the various types of ambiguity affecting proper names in ordinary discourse, 251-6 LEMMON, E. J. 1 Quantifiers and modal operators, Vol. LVIII (1957-58), pp. 245-68 Synopsis: A The aim: to illustrate the logician's system-construction, by reference to systems of quantification and modality, 245 B (I) A consideration of Lukasiewicz's system of syllogistic, as a formalization of Strawson's doctrine of presupposition, 245-9 C Further attempts to formalise the doctrine in a syllogistic, and difficulties that arise 250-4 D The system 'Syllogistic S' found to embody a 'weak' form of the doctrine, which seems philosophically defensible, 254-6 E Negative and conjunctive terms suc- cessfully introduced into 'Syllogistic S', at the expense of traditional obversion, 256-61 F (II) Re-interpretation of 'Syllogistic S' as a system of modality which avoids the para- doxes of strict implication, 261-3 G But a new paradox is generated, that from im- possibilities nothing follows: discussion of this paradox, 263-7 H A comparison with von Wright's systems based on a dyadic modal operator, 267-8 2 Is there only one correct system of modal logic? Symposium (with G. P. Henderson), Suppl. XXXIII (1959), pp. 23-40 Synopsis: A Is there only one system of geometry which is correct under physical inter- pretation? No simple answer can be given, 23-5 B Is there only one system of proposi- tional logic, correct under interpretation? Both intuitionist and classical logics may be correct, under distinct interpretational keys, 25-9 C Four systems of modal logic 56</page><page sequence="61">LEWIS Lemmon, E. J.-continued defined, 29-31 D The systems S0.5 and S 4 both seem correct for different precise interpretations of the modal operator: (a) as 'it is tautologous that'; (b) as 'it is mathematical law that', 31-4 E The system S 5 is apparently correct for the interpretation 'it is analytic that', 35-7 F Some difficulties in giving epistemic interpretations to modal operators; the system M recommended as an epistemic logic, 37-40 LEWIS, H. D. 5 Private and public space, Vol. LIII (1952-53), pp. 79-94 Synopsis: A Proneness to relegate hallucinations and mental images to a private space, on the ground that they are real at all. They at least seem to be related spatially to other objects; reflections, for example can be located, 79-82 B Further illustration from the case of hallucinations. Those are in some sense very private, and yet Macbeth could say exactly where the dagger was and where the ghost of Banquo sat, 82-4 C Mental images and the things we see in dreams. There is a harder problem here, but it looks as if we could to some extent locate here also. This suggest that mental images, hallucinations, etc., are not different from physical things in being in a private space but only in being wilder, and more loosely related to other things, in a common space, 84-5 D A new difficulty arises if we hold that a mental image or hallucination occupies a part of real space or mono- polises an area of it. If the ghost occupies a seat how could another person be actually sitting in it at the time? Other people might see a plate where Macbeth sees a dagger, 85-6 E Discussion of attempts to solve this problem by regarding images as merely 'presented in' space and not 'occupying' it. Rejection of this suggestion; and of another solution, namely one in terms of the statement that Macbeth merely thinks he sees a dagger. (The dagger is real in some sense and covers at least a certain area which is normally taken to be differently covered), 86-7 F The argument that in practice different people do see different things in the same space. I may see a red light through coloured spectacles where others see a green one. Nevertheless it seems strange to say that a coloured surface could present itself in a part of space where a different surface presented itself to someone else. Attempt to counter this in terms of the way we see reflections through other objects, e.g. when I see the occupants of a compartment in a train and also persons from another compartment reflected in it. Reply that this never literally happens, that we never strictly see the reflection and the reality in these cases at precisely the same moment, 87-90 G Final solution suggested in terms of the view that the nature of space itself is quite different for each individual. Nothing could literally occupy the space I see in the mirror but there will be something corresponding to it in some mode of experience which other people have, 90-3 H Con- trast between this conclusion and Lord Russell's view in Our knowledge of the external world, 93-4 6 The cognitive,factor in religious experience, Symposium (with C. H. Whiteley), Supp. XXIX (1955), pp. 59-84 Synopsis: A That only individuals can have religious experience, 59-61 B The main question to ask about religious experience is the epistemological one, about its validity or cognitive value, 61-3 C That religious experience has always God as its object. God to be regarded as complete or absolute in a way which is not possible for any finite being, 63-4 D Treatment of the objection that many religions are directed to other objects- polytheism, religions of humanity, Buddhism. Attempt to counter this; also an account of idolatry, in terms of the tendency to reduce the impact of the divine, by incapsulating it within its finte media, 64-8 E Further criticism of loose uses of the word religion. The use of religious terminology in humanist or secularist contexts, 68-70 F Application of this criticism to recent empiricist and positivist views of religion. The suggestion is made here that a significant affinity may be found between positivism and a sound religious attitude, in that both reject attempts to make religion exhaustively rational. God, as transcendent, must be incomprehensible; but how, in that case, can true religious state- ments be made? 70-4 G Further discussion of the meaning of infinite and transcendent; and futher account of the difficulty of making particular religious claims, 74-80 H Rejec- tion of such solutions to this problem as appeal to authority, or to the notion of choosing to believe, 80 I Outline of final answer, in terms of distinctive religious experience in which awareness of the transcendent, as involved in the existence of all other things, associates itself significantly with other features of experience, leading up to the sense of a personal presence that has much affinity with knowledge of another's mind, 81-3 J Some consequences for theology and for the philosophy of religion, 83-4 7 The autonomony of ethics, Symposium (with R. Holland), Suppl. XXXII (1958), pp. 49-74 Synopsis: A Consideration of recent attitudes towards the ethical realism of G. E. Moore 49-51 B Indication of Mr. Holland's main argument. It seems to consist in holding that the theory of the 'non-natural quality of goodness' is not consistent with the distinction 57 E</page><page sequence="62">LEWY Lewis, H. D.-continued between ethical (moral) predicates and non-ethical (non-moral) predicates, 51-3 C The distinction between moral and non-moral good is amplified and its importance stressed, 53-5 D Refutation of Mr. Holland's main thesis. (a) There is no reason in principle why the theory of 'non-natural goodness' should not be consistent with admitting the distinction between moral and non-moral good. There may be other objections to Moore's view, but there is no reason why goodness, if it can be non-natural at all, should not be so in the moral or in the non-moral sense, or in both. (b) Most of those who agree with Moore in deeming good to be non-natural, have also accorded great prominence to the distinction between moral and non-moral good-Ross for example. (c) It is plain that Moore himself recognises non-moral good and treats it seriously, for he thinks highly of conscientious action and considers it to have intrinsic worth, 55-66 E Brief note of Mr. Holland's other arguments. He holds for example that the utilitarian can 'fill in the details' of his duty as he pleases. This is shown to be a grave travestv. The suggestion that non-moral good can somehow be educed out of moral good, is shown to involve difficulties of which Mr. Holland takes no account; and it is suggested that the idea of 'unsacrificeability' and its not being 'moral in character' may be found to have the simpler implications which Mr. Holland ascribes to utilitarianism, 66-71 F Final consideration of Mr. Holland's view that Principia Ethica has been a major philosophical disaster, coupled with a plea for more cautious examination of ethical theories not in favour at present, 71-4 LEWY, C. 3 The notion of infinity, Suppl. XXVII (1953), pp. 45-52 Synopsis: A As to the historical part of Professor Findlay's paper, (i) it should not be suggested that Lord Russell is to blame for difficulties which, in fact, he only discovered; 45-6 B and (ii) I cannot see that Findlay has brought any argument against the view of Frege, that a numerical statement contains an assertion about a concept, 46 C Nor can I find any clear sense in Findlay's notion of the infinite's 'existing as something actual and complete', 47-8 D On one of the main difficulties of the subject Findlay seems to argue as if a mathematical formula could have a well-determined meaning, independently of any calculus to which it belongs, 48-50 E When one is dealing with undecidable formulas, the notion (as e.g. in Hardy and Godel) of a 'mathematical reality' seems to have no place, 51-2 4 Entailment, Symposium (with J. Watling and P. T. Geach), Suppl. XXXII (1958), pp. 123-42 Synopsis: A Statement of the difficulty or dilemma which the paper is to discuss. Consider the following three propositions. (A) 'The proposition expressed by the sentence "Es gibt keinen der Zugleich ein Bruder und nicht mannlich ist" is the propsition that there is nobody who is a brother and is not male'; (B) 'The proposition, that there is nobody who is a brother and is not male is necessary'; (C) 'The proposition expressed by the sentence "Es gibt keinen der zugleich ein Bruder und nicht mannlich ist" is necessary'. It is claimed that the conjunction of (A) and (B) entails (C); that (B) is a necessary proposition; and that (A) and (C) are contingent propositions. If this is so, then it would seem to follow that (A) entails (C). But the conjunction of (A) and (C) entails (B); and from the last two statements it would seem to follow that (A) entails (B). It is maintained, however, that it is quite clear that (A) does not entail (B), 123 B Several possible solutions of the dilemma are discussed, but are found unsatisfactory, 123-5 C It is pointed out that some people may find the author's claim that (B) is a necessary proposition, unconvincing; and a different version of the dilemma, called the 'second version', is therefore given. A second version of the difficulty or dilemma. Consider the following three propositions (D) 'Caesar is dead if and only if Russell is a brother'; (E) 'Russell is a brother if and only if Russell is a male sibling'; (F) 'Caesar is dead if and only if Russell is a male sibling'. The phrase 'if and only if' in these three sentences is to be understood purely truth-functionally. It is then claimed that the conjunction of (D) and (E) entails (F); that (E) is a necessary proposition; and that (D) and (F) are contingent propositions. If this is so, then it would seem to follow that (D) entails (F). But the conjunction of (D) and (F) entails (E); and from the last two statements it would seem to follow that (D) entails (E). It is maintained, how- ever, that it is quite clear that (D) does not entail (E), 126 D Reasons are given for thinking this a better version of the dilemma, 126-7 E Certain ways in which the dilemma in its second version might be solved are discussed, but are found to be unaccep- table, 127-8 F Summary of this part of the discussion. It is claimed that it is certainly the case that the conjunction of (D) and (E) entails (F); that (E) is necessary: that (D) and (F) are both con- tingent; and that the conjunction of (D) and (F) entails (E), 128 G Does the solution of the dilemma lie in denying that from the four premises (1) the conjunction of (D) and (E) entails (F), (2) (E) is necessary, (3) (D) is contingent, and (4) (F) is contingent, it follows that (D) entails (F)? It is generally supposed that if P strictly implies Q, and if P and Q 58</page><page sequence="63">LLOYD Lewy, C.-continued are both contingent, then P entails Q. If this is so, then (D) entails (F). A reason, however, is given for supposing this general principle to be unacceptable, 129-30 H A modifica- tion of the principle is suggested. It is maintained that if P strictly implies Q, P is con- tingent, and Q is purely contingent, then P does entail Q, in one sense of 'entails'. An attempt is made to explain the notion of 'pure' contingency, and it is claimed that the proposition (F) is purely contingent, 130-1 I What the author puts forward as the correct solution. We must distinguish between two senses of entailment, in one of which entailment is a transitive relation, and in the other of which it is not. In the latter sense, (D) does entail (F), but from this combined with the premiss that the conjunction of (D) and (F) entails (E), it does not follow that (D) entails (E). In the former (transitive) sense of entailment, (D) does not entail (F), 131-2 J An attempt (unsuccessful) is made to explain further the two senses of entailment, 132-9 K A second difficuity or dilemma is stated as follows. (1) The concept of being a brother is identical with the concept of being a male sibling. Hence (2) the proposition 'Russell is a brother' is identical with the proposition 'Russell is a male sibling'. Hence (3) the proposi- tion (D) is identical with the proposition (F). (For the propositions (D) and (F), see section C 6f this synopsis). But it follows from (3) that the proposition (D) is identical with the conjunction of (D) and (F). The conjunction of (D) and (F), however, entails (E). It follows that (D) entails (E). Yet, as was maintained earlier in the paper, it is clear that (D) does not entail (E), 139-40 L Various ways of solving this dilemma are discussed, 140-2 LEYDEN, W. von 1 Philosophy and its history, Vol. LIV (1953-54), pp. 187-208 Synopsis: A Three reasons for enquiring into the relationship between original philosophical thinking and history of philosophy-the two fields different in some respects but alike in others, 187-90 B Philosophers may ask pertinent questions not only about history of philosophy but also within its sphere, 191-2 C The main reason why questions within history of philosophy are rejected by some philosophers as irrelevant is the tendency to make philosophy scientific, 192-3 D Formulation of two views, according to which there is a close connexion between philosophy and the study of its history, 193-4 E The first view. It is based on the recognition (i) that there are limitations to the theory of atomism as applied to historical study; (ii) that historical terms have an 'open texture'; (iii) that historical study, in philosophy, particularly if it is critical, is inseparable from a present philosophical standpoint, 194-7 F A difficulty removed: this view does not imply either (i) that our present standpoint creates our interpretation of past philosophies, or (ii) that there is no difference between 'faithful' and 'wilful' interpretations, or (iii) that any interpretation is necessarily anachronistic, 197-200 G The second view: though philosophers do not carry on where their predecessors leave off, they are in a unique way conditioned by some sort of historical thinking and can never start ab ovo, 200-1 H This view is held by some contemporary philosophers, 201-2 I The greater the subtlety of historical thinking, the more essential are its services to philosophical thinking: (i) it renders present philosophical statements corrigible, thereby dispelling the unphilosophical illusion of their finality, (ii) it provides contexts for the necessarily unending process of clarifying philosophical problems, 202-7 J Any extension of the range of a genuine study in the history of philosophy, remains part of a philosophical pursuit, 207-8 LLOYD, A. C. 1 Thinking and language, Symposium (with I. Murdoch and G. Ryle), Suppl. XXV (1951), pp. 35-64 Synopsis: A 'Facts' must also be discussed if we are to discuss 'thinking' and 'language'. There are three approaches: (i) phenomenological approach. Here, three (overlapping) 'levels' distinguishable in thinking: (a) physiological events, (b) privately intelligible use of symbols, (c) publicly intelligible use of symbols. The function of metaphor in describing thinking, 35-40 B (ii) Logical approach: comparing descriptions with facts. The two not independent; for in natural languages analyticity is a matter of degree. Some criteria for this, 42-57 C 'Comparing descriptions with facts' restated. We must think of how we describe, not of the resulting sentence. Facts, not being bits of nature, are also abstrac- tions. We do the comparing by looking, listening, recollecting etc. in a special way; then we find a description to be appropriate or not. Appropriateness learnt along with the meanings of words, 57-62 D Section C above does not (despite Miss Murdoch's 'fear of the idealists') imply that we can change the world by changing our language, 62-4 2 The visual field and perception, Symposium (with D. W. Hamlyn), Suppl. XXXI (1957), pp. 125-44 Synopsis: A The topic suggests problems underlying the work of psychologists who com- pare subjective facts of perception with the objective world looked at. Physical world 59 E2</page><page sequence="64">LUCAS Lloyd, A. C.-continued vis a vis visual world and visual field. The case for claiming, as a distinct class of objects, what things appear as, 125-30 B Some of D. W. Hamlyn's points criticised. The visual field is 'derivative' only in so far as it cannot be known as such by observation of itself alone. Unsatisfactoriness of 'sense data', 130-6 C What kind of thing is the visual field? Not enough to say that it is merely 'how things look'; for something is actually being correlated with the physical world when psychologists treat of perception. But it is not a private picture which we have, 136-9 D It is a description: but not one which is definable by the perceiver's attitude. Nor is it definable by traditional distinctions between cognitive states such as 'sensation' and 'perception'; it is impossible to distinguish a 'contribution of the senses' and a 'contribution of the mind', 139-41 E The visual field and world are imaginary (not imagined) descriptions, definable by their formal relations to the physical world, 141-3 F It is concluded that all attempts to describe kinds of perceiving a parte subjecti are futile, 143-4 3 How: concepts contain beliefs, Vol. LVIII (1957-58), pp. 289-304 Synopsis: A Can the users of a concept (e.g. 'lightning', in saying 'that flash was lightning') use it without having any beliefs? It is hoped to show, here, that the range of concepts which do not contain beliefs-or, at any rate, which do not contain them in the sense of implying them-is much smaller than is likely to be thought, 289-90 B Concepts as described in encyclopaedia articles, in dictionaries, and in philosophical analyses. The first of these three do clearly include beliefs. The third resemble these more than they resemble dictionary concepts, 290-3 C Some difficulties: (1) in what sense of 'contain' does a concept with 'institutional' reference (e.g. 'undergraduate') contain a belief about the existence of its institutional background? Reasons for saying that such belief is 'implied', and not merely 'presupposed', 293-6 D (2) Can it not be objected that when a concept seems to con- tain beliefs, the beliefs are merely attached to something belief-free, the latter being the concept? But this would be to take an abstraction-the highest common factor amongst the various instances of what we call 'the same concept'-to be the concept. It would also be presupposing a quite artificial scheme of concept-formation, 296-9 E Even a plain concept like seeing can be shown to imply beliefs, e.g. that one's eyes are open and surround- ings illuminated; and these beliefs can be shown not to be merely verbal; moreover there is no relevant distinction here between these and scientific beliefs, or between these beliefs and theories, 299-301 F The sense in which it is out of place to bring in, against the hypo- thesis of beliefs being contained in certain concepts, considerations as to whether such belief-propositions are analytic or not, 301-2 G (3) Because some predicates have to be defined ostensively, those would seem to be simple, and so belief-free? The answer is that so-called ostensive definition does not imply the logical simplicity of the term defined, 303-4 LUCAS, P. G. 1 Explanations in history, Symposium (with E. A. Gellner), Suppl. XXX (1956), pp. 177-96 Synopsis: A The 'speculative' brand of 'philosophy of history' has continued in demand, 177-8 B This seems to many to imply a species of determinism; and so it arouses a 'metaphysical fear'; which, in turn, seems to have led to our preoccupation with 'explana- tions' in history, 178-80 C The issue is about distinguishing such explanations from, or identifying them with, scientific explanations, 180-2 D Whether we try (a) stretching existing terms (to establish affinity with science) or (b) inventing new ones (to dis-establish it) we are virtually confessing that there is nothing to say. May we not adopt, therefore, another pattern of explanation? 182-4 E First we must be rid of a myth-namely, that we normally 'explain', by means of universally-valid generalisations, 184-9 F Have we not been separating too completely, the pattern of historical discussions from the discus- sions which we suppose exemplify it? 189-90 G Why not try the hypothesis that 'historical' are not a kind of explanation, but any kind? (We need not mean every kind at once.) 190-2 H We should thus leave 'scientific' explanation to be simply explanation of something abstracted from the subject-matter of history, 192-4 I Some criticisms to be met and confusions to be negotiated, 194-6 LUCE, A, A, 1 The Berkeleian idea of sense, Suppl. XXVII (1953), pp. 1-20 Synopsis: A The key passage of the Principles (S.1) says that 'collections of ideas . . . constitute sensible things. This implies that the Berkeleian idea of sense is a sensible reality, and is neither a copy of reality, nor mental reality, 1-2 B The contrast between earlier and later entries in his Philosophical commentaries shows that Berkeley abandoned mentalism before he published his Principles, 2-7 C The Scottish school, headed by Thomas Reid, misinterpreted the Berkeleian idea of sense as a representative idea, 7-9 D J. S. Mill was an exponent of the mentalist misinterpretation; for he tries to assimilate 60</page><page sequence="65">AMACDONALD Luce, A. A.-continued Berkeleian ideas of sense to his own 'permanent possibilities of sensation'. He mistakenly says in his Berkeley's life and writings that the Berkeleian idea of sense is wrongly named, wrongly credited with externality, and wrongly credited with identity. These strictures refuted, 9-14 E The sensible, non-mental, constituent idea of sense is to be found passim in the Principles, and on it are built ten key doctrines of the principles, 14-20 LUKASIEWICZ, J. 1 The principle of individuation, Symposium (with G. E. M. Anscombe and K. Popper), Suppl. XXVII (1953), pp. 69-82 Synopsis: A Preamble, 69 B For Aristotle, things are individuals because of their matter, 69-71 C The Aristotelian matter, as something without predicates-'whose character is to have no character', 71-2 D But nothing can be explained by terms which have no predicates, 72 E Form, in Aristotle. This is what a thing is.

S. Peters and J. 0. Urmson), Suppl. XXVI (1952), pp. 163-78 Synopsis: A What is to be argued in this paper: that to define causes as a class of events, and events as instantaneous, is arbitrary and useless in discussing the causal efficacy of human decisions. From observation of the actual causal efficacy of motives I conclude that motives are causes. I begin with the dispositional character in motives. This would seem rather to affiliate them to causes, than contrast them therewith, 163-4 B Their dispositional character does not make them timeless (at a point in time Macbeth's ambition is aroused, and then it is a cause), 164-5 C But here the causality is of a self-determining, not determined, order, 165-6 D Though within such operative cause, various types of motive, moral and natural, are distinguishable; and here, as Mill saw, is something indicative of the agent, 166-7 E Unless 'events' are (arbitrarily) made atomic, there is nothing mysterious about an inner event, 167-9 F Our decisions operate as genuine physical causes, just as, on the other hand, physical causes may determine them, 169-70 G Fur- ther, concerning decisions, character and personality, 170-2 H For Professor Ryle, only an instantaneous occurrence can (and therefore a motive cannot) be a cause. But Ryle seems only to consider a motive in general; which is question-begging. What I maintain to be causal is a particularised (activated) motive, 172-5 I Motive is not an event, but its coming into play is-unless we have first arbitrarily defined ' event ' in a meaningless way. and, unless 'cause' be similarly arbitrarily understood, it (motive) is also a cause, 175-77 J Concluding note on the sense in which the motive for an action may be taken as the cause of it, 177-8 *MACDONALD, M. 7 Art and imagination, Vol. LIII (1952-53), pp. 205-26 Synopsis: A Disputes about rival formulae offered as definitions of art. The light which could have been thrown upon them had their linguistic function been more clear, 205 B Such unclarity as the source e.g. of the attempt, in face of all usage, to confine 'art' to the 'fine' arts, 205-7 C Or, again, to confine the term to what can be construed as 'imitat n'. 207 D My subject, here: art and 'imagination'. And first, the notion. Coleridge. Wordsworth, 207-9 E The wider doctrine, still current, which finds all art the work of mgination. Collingwood. Sartre. Croce. This unconvincing separation between the wor as what is imagined, and that (the medium) in which it is embodied, 209-14 F However the actual play on the stage embodies 'Hamlet', the relation between 'Hamlet' and it cannot be that of universal to particular, or of the 'token' word to its 'type', 214-5 G The bad metaphysics to which the (genuine) distinction between the work of art and its manifestations leads, when read as a distinction between two objects, 215-18 H Another fallacy than this idealist one, is the realist-e.g. Samuel Alexander (existence of the statue 61</page><page sequence="66">MACE Macdonald, M.-continued in the uncarved stone, etc.), 218-21 I The artist may explore and record, but he makes a new thing, 221-2 J Coleridge. Presented in modem idiom, the whole dispute as to whether the 'association' process of Hume and Hartley could explain 'imagination' (as distinct from 'fancy') seems verbal and emotive, 222-4 K What a work is a work of, must be evidenced in the features of the product, 224-5 L Romanticist confusions between doing and apprehending, 225-6 8 The language of fiction, Symposium (with M. Scriven), Vol. XXVIII (1954), pp. 165-84 Synopsis: A Are the statements describing the characters or locations in a novel, to be regarded as false? Ryle and Moore, amongst others, have agreed that they are false, but it seems misleading to classify them with lies, falsehoods, or unverifiable hypotheses. They do not mislead, they are not designed to explain anything-they lack the characteristics of false statement, 165-72 B Could they not be, more, expressions of emotion aimed to induce certain emotions in the reader? This suggestion of I.A. Richards' involves a hopeless extension of the notion of 'expressing', if it is to support the conclusion that the statements of fiction are neither true nor false, i.e. that they are not statements at all, 172-5 C But it does emphasise the important non-describing functions of language, which we must ap- preciate in order to answer our question. The storyteller is creating characters, not reporting or describing characters in existence; the 'descriptions' of fiction are not intended nor understood as descriptions of actual people, i.e. false. They are pretended descriptions which embody imaginative creation, and any accidental correspondence to reality, or lack of it, is irrelevant to their logical assessment. Except in so far as it is necessary for artistic plausibility, we may ignore it altogether, in logical and aesthetic appraisal, 175-84 MACE, C. A. 12 Abstract ideas and images, Symposium (with E. J. Furlong and D. J. O'Connor), Suppl. XXVII (1953), pp. 137-48 Synopsis: A Preamble. The argument of the paper presupposes that the statement 'there are universals' is in some sense true, 137 B What counts as evidence, for me, that another being knows this or that universal? Some preliminary considerations, clearing decks and disclosing the facts with which we start, 137-9 C It is submitted, that what convinces me that another being 'knows a universal' (or can abstract) is the evidence I find, of his having certain skills, 139-42 D Do I need more evidence in my own case in order to be sure that I know anything 'universal' or 'abstract'? 142-3 E When I'learn to abstract, I am certainly aware of features in the process that I could not detect in watching another being learning, 143 F But to consider the addition, as the case of the 'mental pictures' controversy shows, only helps us to understand abstraction, in so far as it proves to be of a piece with the other sort of evidence. (i) If there are mental pictures, it makes no difference to our thinking, 143-5 G Nor (ii) does it matter to our thinking, what sort they are. To what images do make a difference. Their 'function' is to activate the disposi- tion, the possession of which constitutes the having of an abstract idea, 145-8 McGUINESS, B. F. 1 I know what I want, Vol. LVII (1956-57), pp. 305-20 Synopsis: A Wittgenstein (Philosophical Investigations, p. 221) appears to maintain that 'I know what I want' (P) cannot be used to express an a priori philosophic truth; and that 'I don't know what I want' (Q) and simnilar expressions are always senseless. Neither statement is true, 305-7, 313-4 B But if (as is contended) Q may be true, how can P be true a priori? An answer is suggested by the reflection that, in concrete uses, Q can always be paraphrased so as to avoid the suggestion that one wants something without knowing what (i.e. the suggestion that not-P), 307-11, 312-3 C It is even necessary to provide such a paraphrase if we wish to confine ourselves to the primary use of the word 'want', i.e. to that use in which it is applied to paradigm cases of wanting, 3.11-12 D P may therefore be used to express a philosophic truth by exhibiting the primary use of 'want'. It implies not only that Q and similar first-person expressions involve uses of this word other than its primary use, but also that the same is true of third-person expressions such as 'he doesn't know what he wants', 314-16 E Unconscious wants and the wants of infants and animals are called 'wants' because of their resembling the normal wants of men, which essentially involve consciousness, 316-20 F It is not intended to imply that we know the wants of others only by inference from their behaviour, 320 MacINTYRE, A. 1 Cause and cure in psychotherapy, Symposium (with P. Alexander), Suppl. XXIX (1955), pp. 43-58 Synopsis: A The psychotherapist, seeking to alter his patient's behaviour, might try to do so in either of two distinct ways: either (i) by helping him to find reasons for behaving differ- ently, or (ii) by promoting changes in him which are independent of his deliberations and 62</page><page sequence="67">MacIVER Maclntyre, A.-continued decisions, 43-5 B Psychoanalysts, at least, work in the former way, since part of their task is to assist the patient in discovering his motives, 45-8 C Attributions of motive are compatible with, but logically independent of, causal explanations. The analyst may bring out the important features of the patient's behaviour by the right kind of description, 48-9 D The causal explanations which analysts do and must give, are of a perfectly ordinary kind; there is no need to draw any logical distinction between such of them as are offered inside and those encountered outside the consulting-room, 49-51 E Therapeutic success no test of theoretical explanation; and the verifiability of certain analytic hypotheses is dubious, 51-4 F The analyst's account of childhood. It is possible that this is not in fact offered as a causal and explanatory account at all. Success in psychotherapeutic prac- tice may be quite independent of success in the construction of a theory of symptom- formation, 54-6 G Two stages in psychoanalytic treatment: (i) that in which the patient is made aware of unconscious contents, and (ii) that in which he comes to terms with what he has learnt, 56-7 H In the second of these stages psychoanalysis as a rational method of psychotherapy, can be contrasted with those non-rational methods which alter the patient's behaviour independently of his own deliberation and decisions. It is different-is com- parable, rather, with moral deliberation, 57-8 MacIVER, A. M. 4 Knowledge, Suppl. XXXII (1958), pp. 1-24 Synopsis: A Philosophers from Socrates onwards have conceived the business of philosophy to be to make clear the meanings of ordinary words; but only because they assumed that consideration of the way in which a word is used, reveals the nature of what it stands for. This procedure would only be reliable if every word of ordinary language always meant the same thing, and that is not so. Philosophy therefore needs technical terms, 1-3 B Modem discussions of the question 'what is knowledge?'-from Cook Wilson through Russell (in the Problems of philosophy) to Ayer-follow the Plato of the Theaetetus, in asking what account fits the actual ordinary use of the words 'know' and 'knowledge'. The Cook Wilsonians follow Plato, in drawing the conslusion that knowledge and belief are generically different. If that is so, it is oddly difficult to tell which is which, 3-5 C But in fact the ordinary word 'know' is one of which the meaning varies, conspicuously, according to context. In its commonest use in the third person, it is just the word used instead of 'think' or 'believe', when the speaker himself accepts as true what the person spoken of is said to think. This is also a way in which 'know' is often used, even in the first person, in the past tense. An analogous, though different, use is to indicate that the speaker takes it for granted that his hearers agree with him, 5-7 D But its commonest use in the first person -and, interrogatively, in the second-is that in which 'do you know?' has for its regular colloquial equivalent 'are you sure?'. The reason of this is simply that the commonest third-person use is, in the first person present tense, superfluous; because a speaker need not indicate that he agrees, with what he himself thinks now, 7-8 E It does not follow that there is a kind of 'feeling sure' which guarantees the truth of whatever we feel sure of, 8-9 F In yet another usage, the question 'do you know?' demands no longer assurance, but good evidence-though what is allowed to count as good evidence will vary with circum- stances, 9 G Even these are not all the uses of 'know'. But they are enough to show that this ordinary word is singularly unsuited to serve as a philosophical technical term. In these circumstances the proper course to take is to forget about the ordinary use of words as soon as we have identified our problem or problems by means of it. Things said by using the word 'know' raise various philosophical difficulties, but it does not follow that, in sorting out these difficulties, we need use the word 'know' any more, 9-10 H All that we need is the word 'believe', used as Russell uses it in the Problems, where 'belief' is the genus, of which, what Russell calls 'knowledge', is one of the species. But it must be noticed that this use of the term 'belief' is a technical one, committing us to calling things 'beliefs' which would never be so called in ordinary speech, 10-11 I Approached in this way, the so-called 'problem of knowledge' divides into four, 11 ff J (i) What makes a belief true (if it is true)? To this the traditional correspondence theory of truth is an acceptable answer. This is concerned only with truth, in a sense in which a belief can be true quite by accident, 12-13 K (ii) What justifies a belief (if it is justified)? A sense is assumed in which a belief may be true but unjustified, or justified but false. To this the traditional coherence theory of truth was an answer, but its advocates deceived themselves and others by using the word 'true'. It is concerned with the question 'what am I to think?'. What condemns a belief is the fact that we ourselves are no longer sure of it when we have thought out what it would entail, 13-16 L (iii) Why do we believe whatever we in fact beli&amp;ve? This is quite independent of the question whether it is either what we ought to believe, or true. Causation and justification of beliefs are often confused, as in some conceptions of 'certainty'; or by philosophers who claim that psychology . cannot give any account of 'thought' or 'knowledge'; or by psychologists who claim or imply that, if a belief is shown to have a cause, it is shown to have no justification, 16-19 M (iv) Why are our beliefs 63</page><page sequence="68">MACKAY Maclver, A. M.-continued much more often true than they would be by mere chance? The sceptic's claim is that our ordinary suppositions are self-refuting-that, if we were beings such as we in fact suppose ourselves to be, we should probably be wrong. In fact, if human beings were what we ordinarily take them to be, it would be not only unlikely, but quite impossible, that they should be wholly mistaken about the world they live in-for, if they were, the species would not survive. So the only question is' how has this come about?' And this is a biologi- cal question, not a philosophical one, 19-24 MACKAY, D. M. 1 Mentality in machines, Symposium (with J. 0. Wisdom and R. J.

The sentence 'if litmus is acidified it turns red' (as a transla- tion of 'litmus is acid-sensitive') uses 'if' in a sense which is idiomatically equivalent to 'whenever' and not equivalent to the true conditional conjunction, 116-17 F Hypo- theticals however are deducible from disposition-statements, and from law-statements in general, 118 G Every generalisation entails hypotheticals, and every hypothetical is entailed by some generalisation, 119 H And it can be tested only indirectly, via the generalisation, 119 I Are phenomenalist hypotheticals entailed by particular categoricals, in the same way as ordinary hypotheticals are entailed by general statements? 120 J Im- possibility of representing a particular categorical (e.g. 'the cat is on the table') as a generalisa- tion about sense-data, 121-2 K Further impossibility of verifying a phenomenalist hypothetical, otherwise than via ordinary non-phenomenalist propositions, 123 L Con- clusion (cf.

It is here to be argued that this disjunction does not really exist; that the principles underlying his later works are a development of those to be found in his earlier writings, 95-9 B As an example of this, consider 'the realm of eternal objects'-one of the most puzzling concepts of his later stage. It is our contention that this notion refers to an abstract logical structure, derived from the relation of extensive connection holding between events, 99-101 C These abstract relationships are analys- 66</page><page sequence="71">MEAGER Mays, W.-continued able into an indefinite number of limited structures. On a more concrete level, Whitehead would say that though, for example, nature is analysable into a multiplicity of finite struc- tures (or objects) each of which has its own individuality, they are nevertheless related together in one system, 102-6 D Whitehead discusses such abstract structures under the heading of 'abstractive hierarchies'; they may be either finite or infinite. Our experience, for example, has associated with it an infinite abstractive hierarchy, in the form of a spatio- temporal perspective. On a logical level the realm of eternal objects bears some resemblance to the hierarchy of types, 106-18 3 The epistemology of Professor Piaget, Vol. LIV (1953-54), pp. 49-76 Synopsis: A Preamble. The paper gives some account of Piaget's epistemological position so far as his logical and mathematical views are concerned, 59ff B The difference between the genetic and the normative approaches to epistemological problems is discussed. Piaget claims that his approach gives us, for the first time, a method of experimentally investigating philosophical principles and concepts, 52ff C Piaget believes that a careful study of logical behaviour at its simplest level (in the child) and at different develop- mental levels, will enable us to obtain a better understanding of the logical behaviour of the adult. His views are comparable with those of Bridgman; 55ff D and Ryle. The latter, for example, emphasises the part played in the acquisition of concepts, by concrete be- havioural activities and skills; and this bears some resemblance to Piaget's own views on concept formation. Piaget contends that even our conception of an objective world involves a definite learning process; and that the manipulations the child performs upon physical objects are the precursors of our abstract logical notions, 58ff E Discussion of Piaget's accounc of the nature of logical and mathematical notions, showing how it differs from that of empiricists like Mill. It differs, since, for Piaget, mathematical and logical systems though arising from behavioural activities, are, when constructed, subject only to the formal rules of the system. He believes that mathematical notions in the child originate from simple actions, such as assembling, dividing and ordering. However, Piaget's work is not to be taken as a substitute for philosophical inquiry, but as adding a new dimension to it, 69ff 4 Linguistic rules and language habits, Symposium (with G. C. J. Midgley), Suppl. XXIX, (1955), pp. 165-84 Synopsis: A Three different interpretations which are given to linguistic rules: (i) they are rules of a formal system (artificial languages, logical calculuses), 165-7 B (ii) They are laws telling us how we ought to use words; and (iii) they are rules which have been read-off from actual habits of speech. Of these, the last two take a speaker into account, and not only expressions. Criticism, 167-9 C Critical assessment of the second of these inter- pretations: linguistic rules as obligations or prohibitions, 169-70 D The third inter- pretation tends to reduce philosophical enquiry to a form of social anthropology. But in the nature of the case, can the rules of actual linguistic practice ever be fully stated? 170-3 E Language and speech, 173-4 F Are linguistic rules conventional? 174-6 G Lin- guistic rules as skills. This fits in less well with how we learn our native tongue than with how we learn a foreign one, 176-7 H The situation is similar when linguistic rules are compared to the rules of a game, 177-9 1 Are rules of linguistic usage promulgated by some authority?

How do we individuate works of art? And how does this affect the logic of aesthetic evaluation? 49-50 B Many principles of individuation are in use. Paintings, e.g. are usually treated as model-universals like Platonic forms; literary and musical works are individuated by reference, not to a model- manifestation, but to a master-specification. In general a work of art is individuated as a set of qualitatively indistinguishable manifestations of a patterned group of elements, 51-9 C R. M. Hare (P.A.S. 1954-55) treats poems as types, not individuals; and hence, as logically susceptible of 'universalisable' evaluation, Examination of his argument shows that universal evalutions of characteristics of objects, are relevant only with reference to some purpose (not an object) which may be fulfilled by any one of a number of objects, provided that they manifest the required characteristic in some form. Hence the claim that no such evaluation is appropriate to a work of art, amounts to the traditional claim that works of art as such are to be valued for themselves, and not for their instrumental potentialities, 59-63 D This view of aesthetic value leads Mr. Hampshire (Aesthetics &amp; Language) to impugn aesthetics, as the logically-inappropriate provision of general principles of evaluation of works of art; contrasting it with ethics as the provision of general principles of evaluation 67</page><page sequence="72">MIDGLEY Meager, A.-continued of conduct; the latter being rational, since social life renders conformity desirable. This contrast between moral and aesthetic judgment not fundamental. In moral judgment, situations in which action is to be taken must be treated as non-recurring wholes in which to evaluate the act, just as in aesthetics we must take works as non-recurring wholes in which to evaluate a feature, 63-7 E Can there be a rational form for such evaluations? Much aesthetic reasoning appeals to a relevant model work, providing a kind of 'ostensive' general principle of evaluation having a limited scope. The relevance of such an appeal would depend on recognition of a general similarity (i) between the total point of the model and that of the work to be evaluated, and (ii) between the contributions made by the critisized feature in the work and its counterpart in the model work. The merits of this form of appeal are (i) that it allows for a limited comparative evaluation of works, and of their features, each in the context of its own work, thus offering nevertheless a basis for technical rules; and (ii) that it allows the generalisation of an evaluation of a feature in a model work, without requiring the (perhaps impossible) precise specification, in general terms, of the commendable characteristic, 67-70 F We therefore conclude, with Kant, that works of art are essentially individuals, in that they are accessible only to this form of general standard of evaluation, 70 MIDGLEY, G. C. J. 1 Linguistic rules and language habits, Symposium (with W. Mays), Suppl. XXIX (1955), pp. 185-212 Synopsis: A To approach concepts via linguistic rules is not to substitute description of behavioural for description of mental happenings, but to recognise that talk of concepts is not description of happenings at all, 185-6 B What would it be to discover or describe concepts independently of rules for their expression in language? 186-9 C Such rules are not empirical generalisations about speech habits, 190 D Their status is that to interpret behaviour by them is to interpret it as language, 190-2 E A machine's be- haviour may be interpreted by such rules, 192-4 F But this is not to treat the machine as thinking, since we do not agree with the machine on the rules of interpretation, 194-8 G The philosopher's reference to what 'we' do or say refers to such agreements, to which he is himself a party, 195 H Reference to concepts involves simultaneously using and discussing such agreements, and hence reference to the rules of 'our' language, 195-200 I That concepts exist in virtue of linguistic rules does not entail (i) that I can have no ideas I cannot express; 200-1 J nor (ii) that rules must be 'laid down'; 201-4 K nor (iii) that talking is merely following tules and involves no 'creativity'; 202-4 L nor (iv) that a linguistic rule requires anything particular to be done, 204-5 M Two serious mistakes have been to think (i) that philosophical analysis consits in stating rules of usage; 205-6 N (ii) that such rules describe behaviour, 206-7 P 'Ordinary language', in the sense relevant to philosophy, is not the speech of a particular group, but all speech into which 'our' speech may be translated by rules 'we' are agreed on, 207-10 Q Violations of ordinary usage are philosophically objectionable when they subvert the agreed methods for maintaining and modifying the rules, 210-12 2 Linguistic Rules, Vol. LIX (1958-59), pp. 271-90 Synopsis: A Syntactic rules involve relations, and are not bound to specific inference-routes; while semantic rules are concerned with truth-conditions and not with appropriate reactions to utterances. Thus linguistic rules are not prescriptive of actions, 271-6 B Games may be, and languages must be, regarded as systems of elements constituted by rules which define relations, not which prescribe actions.

XXXI (1957), pp. 175-90 Synopsis: A Preamble, 175 B Defence of Hare's distinction between 'phrastic' and 'neustic' against Mayo's criticism, 175-9 C What is the genus, of which 'varieties of imperative' are the species? How tell whether X is an imperative? Possible criteria:-(i) grammatical form: but sentences in the indicative mood may express imperatives, (ii) resem- lance to commands, i.e. whether the sentence tells someone to do something: but how are we to know whether the use of a certain form of words counts as someone's telling someone else to do something? (iii) The speaker's intention: but this is insufficient, unless there is a recognized convention that the words used are a way of telling someone, cf performatives, 180-4 D (i) Stronger and weaker senses of 'tell'. When Hare contrasts 'telling someone to do something' with 'getting someone to do something' and puts 'advising' in the former class, he uses a weak sense of 'tell'. But the stronger sense is more common, and in this sense 'telling someone to do something' is generally incompatible with 'advising' him, (ii) 'advising' presupposes recipients' freedom as a rational agent, as telling (i.e. commanding) does not, 184-7 E Hare prefers to define imperative in terms of sincere assent, i.e. a sentence expresses an imperative, if sincere assent to it involves doing what it says. He gets round difficulties about sincere assent by making it a matter of definition: to know whether X is an imperative we have to ask 'is this sentence such that sincere assent to it involves doing what it says?' Difficulty about 'involves'. How does sincere assent to a sentence involve my acting in a certain way? It must be clear from the grammatical form or some other convention that the sentence has this force, 187-90 F In so far as Hare's criterion of sincere assent is useful it must apply to all answers to the question 'what shall I do?' This class is much wider than that of imperatives, as ordinarily understood, 190 MONTEFIORE, A. 1 Determinism and causal order, Vol. LVIII (1957-58), pp. 125-42 Synopsis: A It is frequently argued that because they do not compel, causes are compatible with freewill; but, on the other hand, that they cannot succeed their effects, because they are 'effective'. These positions, both of which have been maintained by Professor Flew, are incompatible, 125-6 B Difficulty of giving any precise definition of causal determinism without 'formulating away' what makes it a serious problem-'modern standards of pre- cision' are based on the standpoint of an observer, while causal effectiveness is essentially an agent's notion, 126-30 C Even if we revise our standards of precision, determinism cannot be formulated in terms of causes that provide levers for agents to pull; for in the world of determinism, there are no genuine agents, 130 D As for backward causation, if causes are levers by which agents may bring about changes, it is inconceivable; while, if they are taken as sufficient conditions, with effectiveness left out, it raises no difficulty at all. The question is whether there might be any in-between sense, 130 E The example of pre-cognition. Some people claim to foresee an inevitable future, but others only a future as it will be if nobody interferes. It is arguable, either way, that an event might precede its effective cause without the cause being even theoretically available as a lever, 131-4 F With these people, as with the ordinary person worrying about determinism, the relevant sense of 'cause' can be clarified neither from the observer's view-point nor from that of the agent. We have a cause which makes things happen, but which is unavailable as a lever- closer to our experience of being on the other (levered) end of the stick, 134-6 G Objec- tion that all this is un-necessary, as it is impossible to change even the future, 136 H But this is an observer's argument. The idea of 'the future as it might have been' is essential to an understanding of the agent's view of causal change, 136-7 I Another possible objec- tion, urged e.g. by Mr. Pears, is that those who say the future determines the past forget that 'the future' is a phrase of success which must not be used 'prematurely', 138 J The exact force of this argument is difficult to see. But it seems, in the end, to be less an argument for, than a straight re-assertion of, the view that the future cannot determine the past; and so it cannot count as a reason for holding this to be impossible, 139-41 K A final objection- that the above argument is but a (sufficiently weak) instance of 'sticking to ordinary language', 141 L True, I have not entered into the fundamental question, namely how to relate the standpoints of observer, of agent-and, no doubt, of sufferer too. But it at least should be clear that views on determinism and on backward causation have implications for each other; and that both must depend on how one settles the question of the relationships between these various standpoints, 141-2 MUNDLE, C.

I Thinking and language, Suppl. XXV (1951), pp. 25-34 Synopsis A It is here assumed that 'thinking' is 'mental contents' or 'mental activity' of a private kind: e.g. images, sentences uttered to oneself. Thought is not just words or images; it is words or images occurring in a certain kind of way, Consideration of the empirical nature of thinking leads to two preliminary conclusions: (a) we cannot divide words sharply from images as they occur in thought. (b) Our empirical verbal language cannot be separated (as the manipulation of mathematical symbols can be) from its occurr- ence as a thought-content, 25-7 B Language and thought are not co-extensive. There is 'give and take' between them. Words may stimulate or stifle thought. Here it is sometimes important for us to define mental events as such. For instance, it may be morally important to characterize a particular mental content, in a way which is not decided by its overt context. Thought-experience overflows its verbal content. We naturally resort to metaphor in describing such experience, 28-9 C We are advised (by many present-day philoso- phers) to avoid the word 'experience'; mental data are hard to identify, and mental concepts are supposed to have meaning in relation to outer, not inner, conduct. But both the criterion of meaning and the 'ontological conclusions' may be challenged. The mind should not be divided between obscure private communings (about which nothing can be said) and overt cases of intelligent, etc. conduct. Mental contents undeniably exist and are often a part of what is 'meant' when words descriptive of the mind are used, 30-1 D We need and use the idea that thoughts are particular inner experiences. This idea is connected with our notion of the privacy and unity of our 'selves' or 'personalities'. It is as if our thoughts were inner events: a necessary regulative idea, 31-2 E Our thought-experience is riddled with the sensible. Metaphor is natural and fundamental in its description. This may lead to a new view of concepts. 'A concept is how a word is used': this idea is of limited value. Conceptualising should often rather be thought of as an activity of grasping our situations with the help of a fundamentally metaphorical language: thinking, not as 'designative', but as 'understanding' and 'possessing', 32-4 F What are the criteria for being 'right' in characterizing a private content? This question has sense in the context of an individual's own self-examination. We may be led here to a harmless sort of 'idealism'. The problems suggested by an empirical study of language should not be set aside, 34 2 Nostalgia for the particular, Vol. LII (1951-52), pp. 243-60 Synopsis: A The concepts of 'experience' and 'mental events' have been dropped from philosophy, partly because we cannot find such events. and partly because we do not need them to explain the logic of 'mental concepts', 243-4 B It is certainly not satisfactory to suggest that mental events 'justify' uses of words. But a sense remains of a problem un- solved, 244-5 C This problem may be divided into: (a) do we have mental experiences which are determinate and describable as physical experiences are? (b) Are there mental experiences which are 'self-describing', have 'intrinsic sense'? 245-6 D Critics of the concept of mind tend to confuse the question of identifiable mental contents with the question of acts of meaning. A feeling is identified as 'jealousy' via its context, not its intrinsic nature. Yet there are occasions (e.g. when I feel morally responsible for a thought) when the mental item itself, and not its context, is in question, 246-7 E What is the special difficulty in describing inner experiences? Ayer divides the mental region between overt conventions and obscrue private phenomena. Ryle (in Aristotelian Society Supplementary 70</page><page sequence="75">MURDOCH Murdoch, I.-continued Volume XXV) makes the concession of dividing descriptions of 'mental processes' into 'chronicles' (of psychological events) and histories (graphic descriptions), 247 F It may be felt that the real activity of the mind is lost by these analyses. Are 'thoughts' especially hard to describe? The further we move away from the situation where the descripta are ordinary experiences, the harder description becomes: whether the experiences are thoughts or bodily sensations or sensations of the 'external world'. In the case of the latter there is of course the 'outer correlate', the fact that others 'see the same'. Language here can apply unambiguously, 248-50 G Yet we do not necessarily feel that our descriptions of the completely private experience are inexact. We naturally use metaphor, and do not neces- sarily feel that the description is therefore indirect. To say that it is metaphorical is just to say that there is no outer correlate. Metaphor is not the comparison of one 'given' structure with another, 250-2 H We move on to the second problem: the mental event as an ex- perience of meaning. This problem contains the real source of uneasiness. We feel we can identify experiences independently of language. The problem of universals: we cannot take anything away from one occasion to make us certain on the next, What we are 'inclined to say' seems insufficient. We are tempted by the idea of an intrinsic sense, 252-4 I There are conclusive verifications: but they need a context. It is context which decides what is the specific utterance of an experience. We must distinguish the clearness of experiences from the exactness of concepts. (The missing shade of blue). We feel experience to be intrinsic- ally significant because we can brood on it. But brooding also shows it to be endlessly various in meaning, 254-5 J Yet are there not 'moments' of significance, when we 'gaze'; experiences which are determinate at the time, have inner structures of their own? Aesthetic experience and 'significant form' have come to mind, 255-6 K In a complex work of art the meaning of the 'moments' depends of course on the whole. A simple aesthetic object can be contained in a moment: but even this is not a self-contained bearer of meaning, 256-7 L Rilke speaks of a momentary impression 'assuming the proportions of a symbol'. An experience of significance? Yet the structure and meaning is given retrospectively, 258-9 M Modern analytic techniques appear to lift the sense out of immediate experience in order to scatter it over conventional context. Made weary by this, we fail, however, to discover immediate significant experiences which are independent of our ordinary conventional modes of understanding; but we can discover those features of experience which inspire the vain quest, 259 3 Vision and choice in ?norality, Suppl. XXX (1956), pp. 32-58 Synopsis: A It is a peculiarity of ethics that the segregation of the items to be studied is less easy than in other branches of philosophy. A narrow selection of items may lead to an inadequate theory. Mr. Hepburn draws our attention to items which are not usually studied. His paper raises the question of whether a clear distinction of form and content can be made in morality, 32-4 B The 'current view' of ethics pictures the moral life of the individual as a series of overt choices in specifiable situations. Moral judgments are sup- ported by reasons. A moral concept is seen as an objective definition of an area of activity plus a recommendation or prohibition. This view displays the agent as rational, responsible and free, 34-6 C But facts about our lives as moral agents make this view seem un- satisfactory. We make 'fables' about ourselves. These 'fables' may or may not be coherent and comprehensive. Fable-making is not an unusual activity; one may distinguish various forms. These personal 'visions' may be brief or extended, overt or secret, more or less pictorial and imaginative. One should distinguish inner introspectible phenomena from private 'visions'. The latter may be secret or revealed. Modern philosophy tends to exclude both together from serious consideration, for reasons which properly apply only to the former, 36-8 D Mental behaviourism leads, in ethics, to moral behaviourism. In assembling data for ethical study, not only 'mental events' but also 'personal visions' are left out. The idea that moral concepts have meaning through external criteria joins with the idea that moral language guides choice through factual specification, to produce a behaviouristic picture of morality, 38-9 E But the 'inner life' in the sense of personal attitudes and visions which do not obviously take the form of choice-guiding arguments must be included in the initial data. When we assess a person we take account of his per- sonal attitudes and visions, his conception of himself, his picture of the world, 39-40 F On the current view, moral differences are seen as differences of choice, given a discussible background of facts. But if we consider the inner life in the above sense, moral differences look less like differences of choice, given the same facts, and more like differences of vision, 40-1 G We are then led to see the idea of 'choice' as problematic and less central. We do not always understand other people's moral concepts; to explain a disagreement may in- volve communicating a vision. Moral differences are conceptual, not just behaviouristic, 41-2 H This view is resisted because (a) it is felt to be 'safer' to stress action than to stress insight. (b) 'Conceptual' differences may be deep and hard to change, so that the agent is envisaged as less free than on the current view. (c) The reduction of ethics to logic is made impossible, 42-3 I Let us compare the two views in more detail. Does a morally important fable always imply universal rules? The 'universal rules' model does not describe the case of 71</page><page sequence="76">NOWELL-SMITH Murdoch, L-continued 'unique destiny' fables. A real difference is blurred if the model is used at any price, 43-6 J Some moral attitudes, moreover, positively contradict the universal rules formula, e.g. attitudes connecting knowledge with love and insight with apprehension of the unique. The universality model becomes abstract and uninformative if made to cover all types of view, 46-7 K Much of the charm of 'universality' is in fact borrowed from 'generality'. See Hare and Geilner in P.A.S. 1954-55. It can be seen, e.g. from these two articles, that views which emphasise 'particularity' and 'inexhaustibility' are mistrusted for moral reasons as concessions to irrational conduct. But in fact we cannot always describe situa- tions and individuals as fully as we please, 48-50 L Rules are meant to secure us against the ambiguity of the world. But the concreteness of parables and symbols may itself be a source of inspiration. Christianity has a person (not a rule) for its centre, 50-1 M Much of the power of the current view comes from the feeling that it is a defence against naturalism. In fact, the argument against naturalism ought to be divided into several components. (1) An argument against metaphysical entities. (2) A related view of meaning: empirical terms have meaning via fixed specification of moral criteria, and moral terms via this plus a recommendation. So a moral term cannot be defined by a non-moral term. (3) The conclusion that professed arguments from fact to value contain concealed evaluative major premises. (4) A moral argument or recommendation of a liberal type. (Always reflect, argue, etc.), 52-3 N I would accept a weak form of (1). (3) is acceptable as criticism of crude arguments from facts (e.g. statistics) to value judgments. For (2) I would substitute a theory of meaning in terms of vision. What does this imply concerning the definition of moral terms in non-moral terms? The current view tried to safeguard a certain conception of freedom. The descriptive-evaluative distinction is a way of saying moral terms cannot be defined in non-moral terms because the agent freely selects the criteria, 53-4 0 But if we regard the current view as itself representing a type of moral attitude we shall not think there is a philosophical error which consists in merging fact and value. There are indeed, innocuously, moral 'facts', i.e. coherent moral visions of situations, with no neutral 'atoms' behind them. Moral freedom here looks more like a discipline of reflection, less like arbitrary choice, 54-5 P Much of the impetus of the anti-naturalistic argument comes from its tendency to safeguard a liberal evaluation. But naturalism is not a fallacy, it is a different type of morality. The liberal stresses the discontinuity between the agent and the world. The naturalist stresses his immersion in the world. Why try to explain both with a single model? 56-8 NOWELL-SMITH, P. H. 3 Are historical events unique? Vol. LVII (1956-57), pp. 107-60 Synopsis: A Idealist philosophers believe that history is radically different from science. Their opponents think that, subject to certain concessions, historical explanation is like scientific (causal) explanation. The truth in this can be brought out without the use of obscure terminology, 107-10 B Brief sketch of 'regularity' view of causal explanation. Generalisations and theories in science, 110-13 C Two features of the former (generalisa- tions) not found in history: (i) their need to be universal in scope, however narrowly specific, and (ii) the fact that they are discovered. Where historians (e.g. Toynbee) use this method, their generalisations turn out to be tautologies, 113-14 D Reasons for the absence of these two features from history. How the concessions made by supporters of the regularity view undermine their case. Historians cannot explain what happened when p by applying generalisations about what happens whenever p, because the crucial assumption which is implicit in science (that cases can be alike in all respects relevant to their explanation) can- not be made in history. This explains what is meant by calling historical events 'unique'. Historians neither discover nor test generalisations in the way that scientists do, 115-21 E The role of generalisations in history. It is that of making a particular explanation plausible or implausible. The generalisations made use of in history are matters of 'common know- ledge' about human nature; and an historian's explanation of a particular event must not conflict too flagrantly with such knowledge, 121-3 F Historical statements that look like generalisations are 'summaries', referring to a finite class of cases. Examples from Mathiez and Trevelyan can be quoted to show that such summaries are neither reached nor tested in the way that generalisations are. In summaries causal connexion is thought to hold between individual pairs of events. On any regularity view, the statements in which historians actually use the word 'cause' turn out not to be causal statements at all, 123-7 G His- torical explanation is not the construction of a 'pyramid' of generalisations and theories, but the fitting of events into a pattern. The philosopher's first task is to examine the pat- terns actually produced by historians, and to see how they are built.

The historian creates an impression by arranging selected facts; rival historians select different facts for inclusion or emphasis, 127-35 H Explanations in history do rest in the end on empirical generalisations (about human nature).

It could not have had intentions. A person going through the motions, on the other hand, if stopped when partly finished, would still be said to have had the intention. Why not take intention as 'a set of actions which would if completed', etc.? 138 F Difficulty now with voluntary change of intention. The 'actions' must now include very minute changes which are not properly actions. Yet if they only evidence the intention and are not 'it', where can we look for 'it'?

F. 1 Time, truth and inference, Vol. LI (1950-51), pp. 1-24 Synopsis: A McTaggart's way of thinking about time leads in the end to paradoxes of reduplication. These paradoxes are the revenge which time takes on philosophers who deprive it of its proper means of expression, temporal verbs. For temporal verbs, when they are banished from their natural logical level, persist in re-appearing at a higher logical level. The usual origin of the preference for timeless verbs, which generates this regress, is an obscure misconception about the eternity of truth. For it is dimly felt that thoughts about the future somehow have eternal truths as their contemporary objects. Thus thought, itself a symbolic reduplication of objects, does, when those objects are not contemporary with it, generate surrogate contemporary objects. And, since this spurious reduplication is the ultimate source of McTaggart's conception of time, it is not surprising that McTaggart's conception of time led to more and more puzzling reduplications. And his argument for the unreality of time, which used that conception and its attendant regress, was only a complicated way of expressing a mistaken prejudice against temporal verbs, 1-10 B The conclusion, that the tuth of a sentence is a timeless shadow and so cannot determine the event which the sentence describes, can be extended so as to apply not only to categorical sentences, but also to hypothetical, both singular and general. But in the case of hypotheti- cals, if 'determine' means (not 'make the opposite logically impossible', but) 'make the opposite causally impossible', there is something which can determine the event describable in the consequent, and that is the event described in the antecedent. To say this is to speak anthropomorphically, but anthropomorphism is harmless so long as it does not confuse logical and causal necessity. And it is important to be thoroughly anthropomorphic, and not to forget that the verb in the antecedent which describes the determining event is temporal. For failure to realise this generates one of the puzzles of determinism, 10-18 C Inquiries into the source of this temporal Weltanschauung never progress very far. Either they reach the unexciting result that we use temporal verbs because events happen in time; or else they go a little further and come back with definitions of the past and the future. But these definitions, which ought to be very important, are curiously inadequate. The reason for the baffling inadequacy of this result is that time is a category, 18-24 2 The logical status of supposition, Symposium (with A. H. Basson and B. Mayo), Suppl. XXV (1951), pp. 83-98 Synopsis: A Supposition is what is done by anyone who asserts a hypothetical proposition. And a dispositional property is one whose ascription is analysable into hypothetical proposi- tions whose protases describe tests which have to be carried out on the thing that is said to have the property, and whose apodoses describe the results of these tests. The question is, whether there is something about supposition that precludes a dispositional analysis of certain concepts, 83-4 B According to Mr. Berlin (et al.) there is. Hypothetical proposi- tions can be true although nothing is going on, whereas many categorical statements cannot be true if nothing is going on: therefore the way in which phenomenalists use hypothetical analyses cannot be correct, 84 C It is difficult to assess this claim. For, though hypotheti- cal statements differ from categorical statements, it is hard to say whether the difference is sufficiently great to refute phenomenalism. All that we can do is to list the similarities and dissimilarities between the phenomenalist's hypotheticals and the hypotheticals that give the meanings of ordinary dispositional concepts, 85-7 D An ordinary dispositional concept is one which is completely analysable into hypotheticals. But there are also con- cepts which are semi-dispositional; analysable not only into hypotheticals but also into categoricals. However, in both cases the protases of the hypotheticals describe tests which are carried out on things, 87-90 E Now, the protases of the phenomenalist's hypothe- ticals also describe tests. And this is a similarity between these hypotheticals and hypothe- ticals which give the meanings of ordinary dispositional words. But there are also three differences. The phenomenalist's test is an odd kind of test: it is carried out on things all of whose properties are analysed dispositionally; and the observer is not mentioned in the analysis, 91-2 F However, these differences are not in themselves enough to refute phenomenalism. And in fact Mr. Berlin reinforces his first argument by adding another: that, if the concept of 'disposition' is extended as the phenomenalist wishes to extend it, there will be nothing left to contrast it with. But this argument is open to the rejoinder that the old contrast is preserved as a contrast between different types of dispositional concept, 92-3 G Yet there does seem to be something wrong with the phenomenalist's use of hypotheticals. However, this may be illusion, an illusion which is caused in the following way: we remember that when this type of hypothetical analysis was first introduced the protases described tests carried out on things which had some non-dispositional pro- perties, and we insist that this should always be so. But why should it always be so? 93-4 H We feel the same reluctance to allow Professor Ryle's extended use of dispositional analy- ses for mental concepts; not only because the results of the tests for these so-called disposi- tions are often private: but also because the private basis of the application of these con- cepts does not seem to be analysable into hypotheticals. But this may be a similar illusion, 94-8 75 F2</page><page sequence="80">PETERS PETERS, R. S. 1 Nature and convention in morality, Vol. LI (1950-51), pp. 223-53 Synopsis: A The concept of 'knowing how to behave' sheds little light on questions of ethics, for the important questions are not about the mechanics of playing a game, but about the procedural rules which distinguish one game from another, 223-4 B There are the sort of rules permissible to those who would stay in the ethical game; and the long series of wrangles of philosophers over these is quite compatible with the existence of a corpus of definite ethical procedures, 224-6 C Discussion of Mr. Hampshire's distinc- tion between considerations showing what action to do, and considerations assessing the action, 226-9 D Why Mr. Toulmin's reconciliation between intuitionism and utili- tarianism is too tidy. Why we may yet, with the help of his distinctions, and Mr. Hamp- shire's, make a beginning with the task of rendering explicit the procedural rules defining the morality game. Three supporting rules. These to be supplemented by three assessment rules (assessing (i) an action's voluntariness, (ii) its disinterestedness and (iii) its conducive- ness or otherwise to somebody's welfare) to which may have to be added a seventh, to cover certain second-hand assessments, 229-37 E The existence of these procedural rules is quite compatible with vast areas of disagreement about (i) what rules are worthy of being accepted unquestioningly, and what are only acceptable after first hand assessment; or again (ii) about which of the procedures of the 'closed society' are to be departed from in favour of those of the ' open society'. Without prejudice to the existence of these rules people may even vary greatly in (iii) the concept of 'welfare' which they use in making their first hand assessments. (iv) The width of their sympathies may vary, and so also the weight that they give to limited loyalties, and the degree of intelligence they use in considering the consequences of rules, 237-49 F The 'naturalness' of morality. The main difference between morality and any other sort of game is that we are born into this one. We do not choose its defining procedures, even if we employ them to choose its particular rules. Could its procedures, then, be said to be natural? Hume and Westermarck make a case for this, in maintaining a natural human capacity to make first-hand assessments, (in their theory of the disinterested and retributive emotions). But (with the exception of Piaget's) most modern work on the psychology of morals-e.g. Freud or McDougall-is irrelevant to the issue. It is tempting to suggest that Westermarck's account is a making explicit of a natural set of conditions, necessary for what we are now calling first-hand moral assessment. But it could yield only a trivial case for saying that morality is natural to man. There are mechanisms for passing on traditional assessments (e.g. the Freudean super-ego) and an underlying emotional basis for making first-hand assessments (e.g. Westermarck's retribu- tive emotions). But it remains a matter of convention whether we are traditionalists (intui- tionists) or Kantians or utilitarians. Indeed, the two assessment rules which respectively stress (i) the impartiality of the moral judgment and (ii) its social reference, are at once a main characteristic of the individualist traditions stemming from Socrates and the Stoics, and one of the most distinctive features of the emergence of morality as something different from custom and law, 243-53 2 Motives and causes, Symposium (with D. J. McCracken and J. 0. Urmson), Suppl. XXVI (1952), pp. 139-62 Synopsis: A I approach the concept of motive, not from an interest in ethics or any interest in exorcising ghosts, but from the point of view, simply, of psychology, 139-40 B Mr McCracken has stressed the particularity of 'motive explanations'; but if they explain at all, these explanations must involve some sort of 'whenever' assumptions. Ryle only uses another terminology to make a well-worn distinction, when he distinguishes 'efficient causes' from 'law-like' explanations. (cf. Popper's distinction between 'historical' and 'theoretical' enquiries), 140-5 C The term 'motive' in ordinary usage is confined to contexts where actions are assessed. The trouble with Ryle's 'motives' is that they are such a mixed bag. For the psychologist, motive explanations always involve directedness; though these need not involve conscious anticipation of the gaol-there are, that is to say, uncons- cious motives. To the psychologist it is always important to distinguish motives from other directional concepts, like 'aims' and 'intentions'; for motive explanations involve causal assumptions about the initiating conditions of directed behaviour, 145-53 D Mr. McCracken's problem about whether motives 'occur'. The relevant point here is Ryle's infirm distinction between dispositions and occurrences. All dispositions cannot be ade- quately analysed into a series of 'if-then' propositions, 153-6 E Motives are not the only sort of causal explanation in psychology. Many of Professor Ryle's 'motives', e.g. honesty, considerateness, vanity, are not motives but traits. Psychologists attempt causal explanation of such low-level regularities, by recourse to higher-level theories. And why not? 156-62 3 Authority Suppl. XXXII (1958) pp. 207-24 Synopsis: A Both Hobbes and de Jouvenal introduce the concept of 'authority' to elucidate what is meant by a social system, 207-8 B But they differ in that Hobbes uses it in a de jure sense and de Jouvenal in a de facto one, 208-9 C Hobbes, however, tries to under- stand 'authority' in terms of 'authorize', which is only a particular case of the exercise of 76</page><page sequence="81">POLE Peters, R. S.-continued authority. But he stresses, rightly, the connexion with 'author', 209-10 D The old concept of 'auctoritas' was very suggestive in that it indicates a producing, invention, or cause, in the sphere of opinion, counsel or command. In some spheres of social life it is imperative to have such 'auctores'-e.g. law, the army. The de jure sense of 'authority' proclaims that a man has a right to be an 'auctor'; the defacto sense states that he is one as a matter of fact, 210-11 E The right to give commands, make decisions and pronounce- ments, is granted in different ways in different systems of legitimacy. Weber's distinction between traditional and legal-rational types of authority as applied to the cases in which we speak of 'the authorities' or those 'in authority', 211-12 F Weber's charismatic authority a particular case of the more mundane concept of 'an authority', which involves credentials of a personal sort in the sphere of pronouncements, 212-15 G Difficulties in the analysis of de facto authority. Does it presuppose that the person who exercises it must be, in some sense, in authority or an authority? The distinction between (a) the necessary condidons, and (b) the meaning, of the exercise of authority de facto. Perhaps de facto use of 'authority' is sometimes to deny suggestions that conformity is obtained by other methods such as force or moral persuasion. An order may be obeyed or a decision accepted simply because X gave it or made it, 215-18 H Common features of both dejure and defacto sense of 'authority' serve to distinguish it from, and contrast it with, 'power'. Giving of commands, making of decisions and pronouncements, are distinct from use of force, threats, etc., which are forms of power. Power, however, may be a necessary condition for exercise of authority; it may also be appealed to as a ground of entitlement. But these must be distinguished from the meaning of 'authority', 218-20 I Authority intimately connected with human institutions because men are rule-following animals and it is a contingent fact that, if this type of order is to be maintained, there must be spheres where decisions are accepted and orders obeyed simply because somebody, specified by rules of procedure, has made or given them, 221 J This analysis of 'authority' accounts also for the incompatability between authority on the one hand and, on the other, science and morality where the importance of 'auctores' is at a minimum. In the latter spheres matters are settled by reasons, not by the appeal to a man, 221-4 PLAMENATZ, J. 1 Rights, Symposium (with W. D. Lamont and H. B Acton), Suppl. XXIV (1950), pp. 75-82 Synopsis: A Philosophers' definitions of 'rights' have tended to be both inadequate and misleading: to fail to cover its proper uses and also suggest what is false. It is enough to say that a man has a right, when other men ought not to prevent his doing what he pleases, or refuse him a service he asks for or needs, 75 B To call a right a 'power' is mistaken, both because we often cannot do what we have the right to do, and because many of our rights are to services from others, 76 C It is also a mistake to include the notion of good in a general definition of rights. Just as there may be obligations which are not duties to promote some good, so also there may be rights without reference to good. When we assert the right to freedom, we ordinarily do no more than condemn interference; and this we can do, without attaching any positive value to people's doing what they please. But even if it were true that every right is a means to some good, nothing would be gained by bringing the notion of good into the definition of rights; for by so doing, we should not extend the definition to cover what must not be left out, nor restrict it to exclude what must not be brought in, 76-9 D Political theorists have to take special care not to put too much into their definitions; for they have too often been inclined to formulate them in ways that enable them to draw the conclusions most pleasing to them. On the other hand, they cannot be content merely to use a word like 'rights', without troubling to define it, relying on the con- text to make their meaning clear; for the term has been too much abused in the past, 79-82 POLE, D. L. 1 Logical rigidity and license, Vol. LV (1954-55), pp. 133-56 Synopsis: A Philosophical problems arise from conflicts or contradictions in our thinking at an abstract conceptual level. Modern philosophical 'therapy' seeks so to modify our logical habits that these conflicts will not be felt as such; or to prohibit the growth of language that leads to them. It 'returns to the concrete', 133-6 B This is one instance of 'logical libertarianism', which solves logical problems simply by remodelling the concepts (altering the usages) that give rise to them. 'Disciplinarianism' on the other hand always looks for a solution within the existing rules. It is necessary to find the mean between these two attitudes, 136-8 C There is no single usage that can be guaranteed against the possible need of modification; i.e. there is no deduction in ordinary language (not symbolism) whose validity can be certified in isolation, 138-45 D Our problem in face of an abstract conflict is often which of two usages we are the less disinclined to sacrifice.

In fact they apply throughout all fields of reasoning, 152-6 2 What makes a situation aesthetic? Symposium (with J. 0. Urmson), Suppl. XXXI (1957), pp. 93-106 Synopsis: A Criticism of Urmson's account of what makes a situation aesthetic, 93-6 B An aesthetic reaction is distinguished from a moral or intellectual one in that it involves, in an emphatic sense, an experience: one may judge or act rightly without experiencing at the time anything memorable. Outside aesthetics the more efficiently one reacts the less one is likely to experience at the moment, 96-7 C An aesthetic reaction consists in the experiencing the qualities of an external or quasi external thing, not in the emotions of the audience, 98 D Any such thing, even a system of philosophy, can be made the object of this reaction, though it will not in all cases equally reward it. It is different to under- stand a character intellectually and to appreciate it imaginatively (aesthetically).

We are here seeking a sufficient condition of their non-identity, 97-100 B The first problem before us (Professor Lukasiewicz's paper): how can anything composite be a unity? We are now asking how a whole is related to its parts, 100-1 C As to the firsr problem:- need the question-and-answer 'why is a whole of parts a whole?. Because of its structure' be taken forthwith as tautologous? 101-2 D Not so long as science can specifv the 'physical structure', in virtue of which a physical thing (e.g. a brick) resists external invasion of its unity, 103-4 E And if a human individual has what we could call 'Mnemonic continuity', that could be taken to account for the unity of his composite character, 104-6 F In answer to our second problem we suggest that the sufficient condition for two pieces of the same matter differing from one another, is that they occupy different parts of space at the same time, 106-7 G How this finding can be defended against certain plausible criticisms; namely, through our thinking of 'difference' in terms of the general logical idea of non-identity (cf.

H. 11 Thinking and language, Symposium (with I. Murdoch, A. C. Lloyd and G. Ryle), Vol. LI (1950-51), pp. 329-38 Synopsis: A All three speakers agree that some thinking is non-verbal. Miss Murdoch holds that the description of a thinking process is bound to be metaphorical, and that this is not a defect, 329 B Why must it be metaphorical? Mr. Lloyd's reference to synaesthesia does not answer this question. Professor Ryle on the 'polymorphous character of thinking; his distinction between the 'history' of a piece of thinking and a mere 'chronicle' of the events (private or overt) which occurred in the course of it; his view that the 'chronicle' is of no interest, 330-1 C Miss Murdoch however is interested in it, and this interest is philo- sophically legitimate. Moreover, if thinking is 'polymorphous' the question 'what does thinking consist of ?' does not disappear (as Professor Ryle contends it does). It breaks up into a series of questions, some of which Miss Murdoch discusses. Yet she holds, sur- prisingly, that it is only as if inner happenings occur when we think, 331-2 D I; is true that there is something peculiarly elusive about them, especially if they are mental images. If we pause to examine our images, the history process is arrested. The same applies to 'feelings of direction', 'feelings of transition', etc., 332-4 E The expression 'it occurred to me that'. In much of our thinking, there is very little doing on our part. The important work of thinking often takes place below the threshold of consciousness. It is as if we were consulting an order or invoking the Muse, 334-5 F Moreover, thinking is a teleological process; and the stages of a teleological process are difficult to describe per se, because they can only be understood fully when the goal has been achieved. Hence Pro- fessor Ryle's 'chronicle' is not veracious unless it is a 'history' too, 335-6 G Thinking is also difficult to describe, for a biological reason: normally our consciousness is directed outwards towards our physical environment, 337 H Miss Murdoch's 'as if' theory of inner happenings is therefore unnecessary; and were it correct, it would follow that outer happenings have the same 'as if' character. Nor does her theory of concepts have the idealis- tic implications which she attributes to it, 337-8 12 Itnage thinking, Vol. LII (1951-52), pp. 135-66 Synopsis: A The theory, once widely accepted, that thinking consists in operating with mental images, may be called 'imagism'. But at presenc, many philosophers hold that there is no image thinking at all. This is an error, 135-6 B Examples of image-thinking. The images used in it are usually, but not always, visual ones, 137-8 C In all thinking there must be sensible or quasi-sensible particulars 'in' which we think. In principle, those particulars may be of any sort. We may call them 'symbols', 139-40 D The imagist thesis is that images are the primary symbols. According to Berkeley, words which are not cashable by images are meaningless. From this point of view, verbal images must be regarded as (token) words rather than as images, 140-3 E The distinction between occurrent images and image-dispositions. The view that there are no images but only processes of imaging. Imaging must be carefully distinguished from imagining that. . Those who dislike the entity-word 'image', themselves talk of words as entities, 143-7 F In any phenomenological enquiry entity-words are unavoidable. In imaging we seem to be confronted with something, which has a certain independence of our will. And visual images do resemble pictures in important ways, 148-9 G Objection: if images are particulars, they must be somewhere. Reply: they need not be in physical space. 'Projected' images, however, are located in the visual field, 150-1 H The imagist distinction between primary and secondary symbols. We do often 'cash' our words with images; and though this is not the only way of cashing them, it has the advantage that it can be done in the absence of the objects, 152-4 I Moreover, images come nearer than words to being instances of the concepts they symbolise. They may be called quasi-instantiative particulars. But they are not the only ones. There are also physical replicas. If the distinction between 79</page><page sequence="84">PRICE Price, H. H.-continued primary and secondary symbols is valid, all kinds of replicas (not only images) should be classed as primary symbols, 154-60 J Why is the imagist theory plausible? It is true that thinking must be cum fundamento in re, and the aim of the imagist theory is to ensure this, 160-3 K But it does not follow that thinking must be inspection or something approximating to it. Ostensive definitions are sufficient to keep verbal thinking in touch with reality, 163-4 L Verbal thinking, then, is as 'primary' as image-thinking. But image-thinking does exist, and the imagists deserve credit for studying it, 164-6.t 13 Seeming, Symposium, Suppl. XXVI (1952), pp. 215-34 Synopsis: A (I) The title of the symposium should have been 'appearing' rather than 'seeming'. There is a 'slide' from the perceptual sense of those words to the inclination-to- believe sense, 215-16 B Professor Britton's analysis of appearing in terms of potential judging. In effect, this abolishes perception altogether. 'I now see x' and 'x now looks P to me' are two ways of describing the same fact, 217-18 C 'I should judge A to be C if I ignored or forgot certain facts'. But these facts are themselves perceptual facts. Professor Britton is not analysing 'A looks C to me' but is proposing a substitute for it; the traditional analysis in terms of visual sensation does at least preserve the categorical character of the analysandum, 219-20 D Professor Britton on hallucination: 'he thought he saw-'. But hallucination is not just mistaken belief; and the mistaken belief, when present, is occasioned by a visual experience of an unusual sort, 221-2 E Elsewhere, however, he seems to resolve hallucinations into compulsorily-mendacious statements, and he suggests a similar account of dreams, 222 F But dreaming, like hallucination, is not something purely propositional, 223-5 G (II) Is a sensation-terminology needed, as well as an appearing-terminology? Professot Britton says 'yes, for describing after-images, etc.'. He need not have made this concession, 225-6 H If we introduce the notion of existential appearing ('there appears to be -') as well as attributive appearing ('x appears q), after-images etc. can be described in appearing-terminology. So can hallucinations and dreams, 227-9 I All the facts can equally be described in a sensation-terminology, if we distinguish between what is sensed and what is perceived, as most of the sensation philosophers have done. This corresponds to the distinction in the appearing-terminology between 'there appears to be' and 'there is', 230-1 J But, for purposes of phenomenological description, the appearing-terminology is intolerably cumbersome. Here some form of the sensation-terminology is almost unavoidable; as also when we are discussing the causes of sense-perception, as Professor Britton seems to admit, 232-4 14 Belief and will, Suppl. XXVIII (1954), pp. 1-26 Synopsis: A The view that believing is something voluntary. Some even hold that there are propositions which we have a duty to believe, 1 B 'I cannot believe that'. Why not? Sometimes because it would be unreasonable to believe it. Two criteria of reasonableness in believing; (i) the consistency criterion (ii) the evidential criterion. The first only tells us that we shall not both believe p, and believe q, 2-3 C But what if a statement is internally inconsistent? Such an inconsistency may well be due to the speaker's defective vocabulary; and then our proper response is 'please explain what you mean'. The evidential criterion of reasonableness is the more important one, 3-5 D Inability to believe is, however, often unreasonable; examples, 6 E 'I cannot and will not believe it'. If he will not, surely this implies that he can? But the 'cannot' often means 'cannot afford to' either for emotional reasons, or on moral grounds, it being thought that one has a duty to believe some proposi- tion incompatible with the one suggested. Sometimes, however, the inability to believe is due to mere intellectual inertia, 7-10 F If belief is something voluntary, 'A has a duty to believe p' is not an absurd statement, though we may hope it is false because it would justify religious and political persecution, 10-11 G 'Of course I am bound to believe you'. Here our duty is only to say the words 'I believe you' and perhaps to act as if we believed, 12-13 H The supposed duty of victorian ladies to believe that their near relatives were impeccably virtuous, despite strong evidence to the contrary. But there cannot be a duty to be prejudiced, however excusable such prejudice may be, 13-14 I But can one make oneself believe something by a voluntary effort? Not by a fiat of will here and now. But often it can be done over a period of time, by repeatedly attending to the favour- able evidence and ignoring the unfavourable, 14-18. J Or by repeatedly fixing attention on what it would be like for the proposition to be true, and acting as if it were true, 19-21 K Thus James was partly right when he spoke of a 'will to believe', and when someone says 'I cannot possibly believe p' he may be mistaken, 21-2 L But it does not follow from this that we ever have a moral duty to 'cultivate' beliefs in the way described, 22-4 M The 'ought' which applies to believing is the prudential, not the moral 'ought'. It is to our long-term advantage to adopt the policy of believing in accordance with the evidence because such beliefs are the ones which are likely to be true, 24-5 N If so, it is misleading to speak of the 'ethics' of belief, though we may properly speak of the 'economics' of belief, 26 tCorrigenda, p 155, par. 1,for precept read percept; p 164, par. 1,for about read above. 80</page><page sequence="85">QUINE PRIOR, A.

Russellian definitions, not being axioms, must be rules, and need as careful framing as axiomatic definitions, 208-10 I (apropos of G above).

The axiom-rule dichotomy is exhaustive at the purely syntactical level, but definitions are distinguishable from both when meanings are considered, 212-13 L Moreover, even when a definition is thought of as a rule of re- placement, an axiomatic equivalence does not yield exactly this, unless we have both the law of identity and the rule of extensionality (and the latter at least we do not always want), 213-14 M (V) Final Lesniewskian observation (apropos of K). The Russellian definition of 'definition' is itself only a linguistic proposal; and does not describe how definitions actually function in logical systems, where they are not licences to abridge but gearing devices, 215-16 2 The consequences of actions, Symposium (with D. D. Raphael), Suppl. XXX (1956), pp. 91-9 Synopsis: A If determinism is true the only possible act is the one we do; and if it is false, no act has a totality of consequences; so that on either supposition, if our duty (absolute or prima facie) were that possible act which has the best total consequences, we could never do wrong, 91-3 B The indeterminist can escape this by replacing 'total consequences' by 'objectively-probable total consequences', 93 C Weakened senses of 'possible' will help the determinist in some of his difficulties, but cannot help the utilitarian determinist in this one, 93-9 QUINE, W.

I Seeminig, Symposium (with K. Britton and H. H. Price), Suppl. XXVI (1952), pp. 235-52 Synopsis: A Aim of the paper: to defend Britton's two theses: (i) that descriptions of ap- pearances suppose conditions to obtain that do, or that may, not; and (ii) that philosophers have extended the term 'appearance' beyond its proper field of application. 'Seem' and cognate verbs all work in much the same way in reporting observations, as distinct from drawing conclusions from evidence; being used, in the former case, with the supposition of non-obtaining conditions. The differences between the ways in which conditions can be peculiar is here unimportant, 235-7 B What conditions obtain is a matter of objective fact, so an infinite regress is generated by the attempt to derive all public facts from facts about appearances, 237 C Price confuses two distinctions. Perceptual uses of seem and inclination-to-believe uses of the same word can be combined. They are opposed respec- tively to different sorts of use, the former to evidential and the latter to phenomenological, 238-9 D 'This appears i' does not mean the same as, but presupposes, 'if I were to ignore the conditions of observation I should say that this was q', 240 E There is no sense of 'see' in which the existence, in the appropriate manner, of the object seen, is not implied, 241 F The sense-datum language replaces the phenomenological-appearance statements of ordinary speech. Its application outside sense-experience is problematic, 241-3 G It can be applied to hallucinations and after-images but not to dreams and visual images, 244 H Property-words do not have two senses-physical and sensible, 245 I Phenomenalism holds the sense-datum language to be primary, since it could apply in circumstances in which the material-object language did not. Yet in fact, it is derived from the material-object language. Could it be independent? 246-7 J A stationary organism, could keep a phenomenological diary and could go on to base a theory about material objects on the recurrences it would contain, 247-8 K That there are,no predica- tive errors in descriptions of experience, does not entail that there is no possibility of mistake with them, 249 L To have an experience is not the same thing as to recognise it for what it is. Description of material objects requires the former, description of sense-data the latter. For the latter a special, phenomenological, attitude is required, 250-1 M Ex- cept in standard conditions the connection of object-descriptions and appearance-descrip- tions is not logical, 252 2 Properties and classes, Vol. LVIII (1957-58), pp. 33-58 Synopsis: A Predicates have properties as their intensions,'classes as their extensions. Of the vast number of classes some, the natural ones, correspond to properties; and some properties, the named ones, correspond to predicates. This paper argues that to explain our use of general terms, properties must be admitted as something distinct from classes, 33-5 B There are a number of problems, related to the problem of universals, which require for their solution a criterion of differentiation between properties, 35 C The usual solutions of these problems are erroneously formalistic, 36 D Properties are distinct from classes, since not all classes are natural; i.e. such as to enable someone who has been confronted with a few examples to pick out others, 37 E Since natural classes are open, a thing cannot be a bundle of properties, 37 F The problem of universals arises from abstract reference and from classification. The latter is problematic because of the re-applicability of general words, 38 G Re-applicability is usually explained by reference to intermediaries, abstract or mental, to which the things to be classified are related. But such explanations are viciously regressive, or merely repetitious, 39 H The similarity theory is realism in disguise, since resemblance is a universal, 40 I Realism does not, as similarity theorists allege, confuse general words with proper names, 42 J Genuine nominalism is rare. It adds up to the view that all classes are natural, which is at once incredible and false, 42 K Properties exist, but are they objects? If so they must, as Platonists assert, be abstract objects because of the laws of thinghood, 44 M 'There are re-applicable general words L' entails but says more than 'there are noticed properties P'; which itself entails but says more than 'there are natural classes 0,45 N That there are properties is, then part of what is meant by saying that there are meaningful general terms, and is not an explanation of it, 46 Q The traditional theories of universals emphasise different truths in a misleading way. Realists harp on 0, a fact about the world; conceptualists on P, a fact about men; nominalists insist that only through activities of classification do we have any access to natural classes, 46 R The existence of natural classes is a brute fact which is revealed by men's ability to classify, 47 S Naturalness of classes can and does vary in degree, 47 T What distinguishes (i) common properties from family resemblances, (ii) positive from negative properties, (iii) projectible from unprojectible properties, (iv) simple from complex hypotheses, (v) the sense of 'cause' in which it does not trivialize determinism, from that in which it does, (vi) the sense of 'cause' in which it does not trivalize the regularity theory of causation, or does not make all counter-factuals vacuously true, from that in which it does, 47 U Intuitionist answers to these questions imply, wrongly, that properties are directly inspectable, 53 V Reverent septicism is best answered by the provision of a criterion, 53 W Brevity of verbal expression is a symptom, not a criterion, 54 X The specificity-criterion of Popper and Ayer is of only 82</page><page sequence="87">RAPHAEL Quinton, A. M.-continued local applicability; and it leads to odd results where it does apply, since it recognises only distinctive and not conjunctive complexity, 55 Y Goodman's entrenchment-criterion, based on the record of past projections, begs the question and is hard to apply, 57 Z The problems of differentiation can be solved by reference to the concept of (degree of) naturalness, 57-8 RAMSEY, I. T. 1 Paradox in religion, Symposium (with N. Smart), Suppl. XXXIII (1959), pp. 195-218 Synopsis: A Religious discourse revels in paradox and considers it illuminating. But can we give any clues by which to distinguish illuminating-improprieties and revealing- paradox from type-trespass, bewildering confusion, and vicious muddle? 195-7 B Avoid- able paradox which is retrospectively negative. Examples from religious and non-religious discourse. Much of this paradox, such as occurs, e.g. in some Trinitarian discussions, is sheer muddle, 197-9 C Avoidable paradox which is subsequently significant. This kind of paradox clusters around and so spotlights certain words and phrases whose logical placing awaits elucidation, e.g. 'hypostatic unity' (Christianity) and 'Spirit' (Nuer Religion). Such paradox is revealing, but it rather reveals a problem (see D below), 199-203 D Un- avoidable paradox: attempts at logical exploration. (i) Religious paradox in general. An example from Whitehead which seems to indicate how such paradox inevitably arises from the attempt to describe what is 'both seen and unseen' in terms of words and phrases which are normal currency only for observables. A parallel from mathematics. (ii) Paradox arising more specifically within theism. Such paradox can be given an illuminating structure Nvhen the general approach developed in (i) is somewhat particularised in terms of 'models' and 'qualifiers'. Religious paradox is thus illuminating when it generates potentially in- finite procedures whose aim is to evoke a disclosure. But this discussion leads us back to the basic problem (noted in C above): if we are to defend unavoidable religious paradox, and to show how paradox in religion can be finally illuminating, we must do something to illumi- nate the logical behaviour of those ultimate categories which belong characteristically to religions, e.g. God, Nirvana, Spirit, and around which the unavoidable paradoxes cluster, 203-9 E Unavoidable paradox: is it, in the end, logically inaccessible? Some would say that it was: discussion of Tertullian, Kierkegaard, Barth and others. Alternatively, it can be claimed that we have a clue to the logical behaviour of these ultimate religious categories in the word 'I' as used by each of us of ourselves. So consideration of 'I', the paradoxes associated with it, and the empirical anchorage it must be given, can encourage us in our logical exploration of illuminating religious paradox. The d.istinction between type- trespass and revealing paradox. Some practical conclusions, 209-16 F Summary, 217-18 RAPHAEL, D. D. I Jtstice anid liberty, Vol. LI (1950-51), pp. 167-96 Synopsis: A Theme. The concepts of justice and liberty both emphasize the value of the individual, 167 B Plato and Aristotle connected democratic ideas of justice with liberty. Modern theorists often assume a conflict between liberty and equality, while im- plying a connexion between liberty and desert, 167-70 C Desert and equality are independent principles of justice, but both protect the claims of the individual, 171-3 D The concept of desert can be explained only in part by social utility. An obligation to punish is to be justified on grounds of utility, but first there must be guilt to permit the infliction of punishment; the force of the retributive (or desert) theory of punishment lies in the protection of innocence. Demerit implies the absence of a claim normally present; merit implies the existence of an additional claim to those normally present. Like the concept of liberty, that of desert ascribes claims to the individual as an end-in-himself, 173-82 E Claims to equality cannot be justified by theological doctrine. Some of them are negative claims against unwarranted discrimination. Justifiable discrimination may be based on merit, capacity, or need. The last implies a positive claim that, so far as possible, everyone should be brought up to an equal level of satisfactions, 182-9 F The claim to equality of opportunity is based partly on utility and partly on the valuing of individual development. The claim to equal satisfactions up to a standard level, such as is the aim of schemes of social security, is based entirely on the valuing of individual persons as ends-in- themselves, 190-6 2 Universals, resemblance, and identity, (1954-55), pp. 109-32 Synopsis: A Theme: the problem of universals, if regarded linguistically, is concerned with the identifying function of general words. The charge that realism simply confuses general words with names appears to be unfounded; and Professor Price's linguistic version of the 'resemblance' theory is subject to old objections in a new form, 109-32 B Realism is not a mere confusion of general words with names, for names have other functions than that of 83</page><page sequence="88">REES Raphael, D. D.-continued identifying. Nor is it the result of inferring Unum nomen Unum nominatum, for this would imply a common meaning for homonyms, different meanings for synonyms, and an inability to recognize a character which had no 'name', 109-11 C Professor Price has suggested that the 'in re' and the 'resemblance' theories are alternative terminologies. The resemblance theory, so regarded, is subject to certain inadequacies,-linguistic correlates of the old objections that real universals must be re-introduced either (i) by speaking of resemblance in a certain respect, or (ii) by treating resemblance itself as a universal, 111 D First objec- tion: a translation of, e.g. 'X is red', in terms of resemblance, will cover resemblances addi- tional to resemblance in respect of being red, 114-18 E Second objection: the first objec- tion can be partly overcome if the translator uses the common noun 'resemblance', which would be contrary to the rules of a terminology designed to avoid common nouns, 118-20 F Realism, if regarded linguistically, is the view that the expression 'the same' has the same meaning in 'the same such-and-such' as it has in 'the same so-and-so', 120-2 G A state- ment which says of two things that they have 'the same' specific character, cannot be trans- lated into resemblance-terminology without running into the difficulties described in D and E above, 122-3 H The problem of universals may be compared with the problem of identity. The in re theory is analogous to perceptual realism, and the resemblance theory to phenomenalism, 124-6 I And in both problems the dispute is ontological. It is not merely terminological. The resemblance theory and phenomenalism are linguistic proposals, dependent on a metaphysical thesis of economy in the types of entity allowed, 126-8 J An alternative linguistic approach to this, as to other philosophical problems, is to explain the use of the relevant expressions of ordinary language, by showing the circumstances in which they are employed. The kind of circumstances which justify the use of 'the same such-and-such' are in fact those which Plato had in mind when developing his theory of forms, 129-31 K The resemblance theory can then be represented as the beginning of an attempt to specify the circumstances in question, and so to explain the identifying function of general words. Realism, like analogous theories on other problems, can be represented either as a metaphysical thesis or as the mere reflection of common sense or common linguistic usage, 131-2 3 The consequences of actions, Symposium (with A. N. Prior), Suppl. XXX (1956), pp. 100-19 Synopsis: A Consequences of an action should be distinguished from its results or effects. Scientists speak of cause and effect, lawyers of cause and consequence, 100-2 B In ordinary language, when results are called 'consequences', the expression is usually being employed for some practical purpose, like imputing responsibility; not simply for the theoretical purpose of describing a cause-effect relation, 102-3 C Lawyers have come to recognize that the legal concept of cause is a practical concept, but they have evidently not yet drawn the corollary that the legal concept of consequences is of the same character. The consequences of an action are those results for which the agent is held to be responsible, 103-6 D The difference between the practical and the scientific concepts may be illus- trated from a difficulty in the English law of tort, about the proper criterion for determining the extent of liability for the consequences of a negligent act. The preferred test (of 'direct consequences') is defended on moral grounds although reasonable foresight, as a test, is more logical. And, with both tests, so-called findings of fact (to the effect that certain con- sequences were direct or were foreseeable) are really normative decisions, 107-15 E Meta- physical paradoxes arise in drawing a line between an action as cause, and its consequences as effect. Here again practical concepts are confused with concepts of scientific explanation. An action includes its consequences. The boundary drawn round the consequences defines the action, 116-17 F Different boundaries may be arbitrarily drawn for different pur- poses. But in familiar contexts there is a conventional boundary, and the consequences so bounded are the 'natural' consequences of the action. Like the natural meaning of a state- ment, they are what would normally be intended but not necessarily what was intended. Utilitarianism recommends that moral appraisal of actions should look to natural conse- quences instead of to the agent's intentions, 117-19 REES, D.

Beyond the primary ones (presented to sense-perception) symbols may include concepts and images, 225-6 F And we must note (a) how symbol and meaning may change places, and (b) how, in this region (of aesthetic experience) symbol and meaning are not cut off from one another, 226 G Illustrations of (a), from poetry, 226-9 H Illustra- tions of (b), 229-30 I (iv) Importance of not separating meanings from the symbols which mean, when we seek 'the meaning of poetry', in 'life'.

Symposium (with A. J. Ayer), Suppl. XXVIII (1954), pp. 77-94 Sivnopsis: A The problem about private languages is the problem of how words mean. Words refer to things, by the way they enter into discourse: if you have said something, your utterance will be taken in one way or another. Rules, 77 B A rule is something that is kept. 'This is red' does not mean 'everyone calls this red'. But in another way the possibility of rules depends on the agreement of people speaking-agreement in what they do. We see that we understand one another without noticing whether our reactions tally or not. But because we agree in our reactions, it is possible for me to tell you something, 78 C This agreement does not anticipate language; it appears as the language does. If people could not be brought to use a word in any regular way-if you and I did not agree in what we called 'the same as we were taught'-then it would not mean anything to say someone had used the word mistakenly-or correctly. Unless the words had a regular use, I should not know it was red, and I should not know what colour it was, because there would be nothing to know, 79 D No one can get the concept of colour just by looking at colours, or of red just by looking at red things. But of course the colour red is not the word 'red', 80 E Con- fusion of (a) giving a definition, and (b) using a word in accordance with a definition. This appears in 'I know what I mean by "red" '. I feel the same sensation as yesterday, and that is the same colour. But the identity-the sameness-comes from the language, 81 F It is not language that tells me whether this feels the same. But I could not have been told without language either-if only because I could not have asked, 82 G Analogies and differences between words for colours and words for sensations. There is a difference between seeing that he is in pain, and being in pain myself; but this does not mean that I know something about myself which I cannot know about him, 82 H If it means any- thing when I say I am in pain again, this is because the word 'pain' has a regular use. Not a question of whether I can trust my memory, but of when it makes sense to speak of remem- bering, 83 I I cannot know a language privately, for what would there be to know? Everything would have to be at once statement and definition. And then it does not matter what mark I use or when I use it, 83 J The point is not that others must see what my words refer to. They cannot refer to anything unless there is a way in which the language is spoken, 84 K I can invent names for my sensations because I speak a language in which 86</page><page sequence="91">ROBINSON Rhees, R.-continued there are names for sensations. But could anyone have invented language? To ask this would be to imply that he had invented what we call use and meaning. And this suggestion is unintelligible, 84-5 L To invent a vocabulary, he would have at least had to invent ways of using these sounds in various circumstances-in the circumstances of a social life which has in fact grown up with language, and could no more be invented than language could. And people would have to understand them, 85 M Why could not a dominant individual force people to respond so or so to sounds, as we train animals to do? They would not be speaking. They would not understand any expression unless they also used the expression themselves. And following a rule in language is not following orders, 86 N For whom would anyone invent language? Unless it were for people with the kind of social life which goes with language, what could be the point? What would a 'language' designed for a flock of parrots be? 87 0 Objection: 'I use marks thus when I speak with other people. Why could not Ayer's Crusoe use them in the same way, even if he had never spoken with people?' Answer: The marks he used could not then mean anything. What I write has significance within a language that is spoken, not otherwise. 'Using them in that way', refers to the fact that I speak that language. For language, there must be 'the way the expressions are used'; and this goes with the way people live, 88 P We could not say that Ayer's Crusoe was using marks in the same way now or that he was using them in a different way. Using an expression in the same way does not mean using it for the same purpose. He cannot be guided by his marks in just the way in which you and I may be guided by words, 89 Q Can a machine follow words, or speak? Cf. 'He knows what he is saying'. If I doubt whether you know the language or whether you ever know what you are saying-I must regard you more as I should regard a tape recorder. Not because it can execute some reaction which you are unable to make but because you do not take part in what it does. Speaking the language others speak-is not just uttering the words. It is carrying on a conversation, or writing reports or listening to a play; it is being someone to whom the rest of us can speak and get an answer; to whom we can tell a joke and whom we can deceive-and so on. All this belongs to being able to follow words. And a machine cannot-i.e. it makes no sense to say a machine follows words, 90 R A machine may be out of order, but it does not make a mistake. And when I make a mistake there is nothing out of order. I can follow words only where a mistake or misunderstanding is conceivable. Otherwise what is there to understand? 91 S If I understand the words, I should be able to use them. Mistaking the meaning belongs to taking part in the language. Ayer's Crusoe cd$uld make only the kind of mistakes that the animals do, who never use words at all, 92 T Unless the meanings of words were independent-unless they had to be learned-they could not be misunderstood. When you misunderstand what you can learn, you are misunderstanding a rule-not a matter of fact. If I am wrong about the tree, I may run into it; but if I am wrong about the meaning of a word, it is not like that. If anyone did not understand the kind of mistake it is-he would not understand what words are, 93 U Suppose someone does not mean what he says. To describe this we have to take account of his relations to other people. It is not just that they use the same words to mean the same as he. What is important is the special role which his using them plays, in these circumstances. If all who used the same words were doing the same thing, it would not be language. Language involves different people using different words in different roles. Language is something that is spoken, 94 RITCHIE, A. D. 2 Agent and act in theory of mind, Vol. LII (1951-52), pp. 1-22 Synopsis: A 'Agent' and 'act' are logically correlative, and there is no reason for assuming that any agent is other than distinct in kind from its act, 1-3 B In the case of mind and mental acts, it is assumed by many philosophers that the agent can be treated as not only similar in kind to its acts, but identical with its acts. This illustrated, 3-10 C What is identified is agent and act, not act and object. Consequences in philosophy of mind are radical.

But this is incompatible with their nature, 190-3 C In her effort to define psychical research by giving it a field, a distinction on which she relies (namely, communication by normal means, versus by abnormal) seems confused; the real distinction being between communication by means, and communication without means, 193-5 D And there is no valid reason for saying that psychical research is not a science- at least in intention-despite difficulties in delimiting a field for it, 195-7 E Mrs. Kneale's premises (in arguing the importance of psychical research for philosophy) (b) as they concern the mental phenomena of p.r.

J. 11 Probability, Symposium (with S. E. Toulmin), Suppl. XXIV (1950), pp. 63-74 Synopsis: A Mr. Toulmin and Mr. Kneale agree that what a theoretical account of pro- bability must do is to clarify the use of probability-terms in ordinary speech, 63-4. The contention of the present paper is that it is far more important to see how probability-terms are used in the scientific theory of probability; and that the scientist cannot allow himself to be restricted to ordinary usages, 65-6 B Defects of ordinary language as interpreted by Mr. Toulmin. His account concentrates on cases of high probability, where some single event is being referred to. On his view, if I say 'so and so will probably occur', I am giving pretty strong backing to the proposition that the event will occur; if the event does not happen I am mistaken; and my reputation depends on my being successful most of the time. Discussion of difficulties where the probability is not high. Scientific theory may justifiably (a) reject Mr. Toulmin's test and (b) interpret the statement about the single event in terms of a statement about a class of events, 67-70 C Mr. Toulmin's analysis of ordinary language leads him, in opposition to Mr. Kneale (a) to reject the statement that something can be improbable but true (b) to deny that (in one interpretation) probability is relative to evidence and (c) to rule out all attempts to define probability in terms of evidence. Mr. Kneale's account of (b) defended, and (c) discussed. It is suggested that short defini- tions of probability, as given in technical treatises, are merely brief summaries hitting off the point of view of the theorist, who is primarily concerned with developing a theory which will lead to adequate procedures for making probability statements. In developing such a theory, it is contended, the scientist has to give to the word 'probable' such significance as the demands of his science require, 70-4 12 Leibniz's account of phenomena', Vol. LIV (1953-54), pp. 167-86 Synopsis: A What we experience of nature, Leibniz calls phenomena. The task of science is to provide hypotheses enabling a clear account to be given of phenomena. In the period before 1672 he holds that there is nothing intelligible in body but magnitude, figure and local motion which he thinks of as independently real. Minds are located in a body, which provides the point of view from which they perceive the world. Thus it is the same space which is occupied by real bodies and by percipients, and in which phenomena, the appear- ances of these real bodies to percipients, are ordered, 167-70 B On the whole, Leibniz keeps these views during his stay in Paris (1672-76) with suggestions that mind must be present wherever there is matter, in order that traces may be preserved of all the causes o all the changes that have occurred in the matter, and with stress (i) on the notion that mind mirrors everything in the universe from its own point of view, and (ii) on the notion of the harmony of the universe through this mirroring, 170-3 C After 1676 space and matter cease to be regarded as real in their own right; the laws of motion reached by 1678 (possibly earlier) based on the measurement of force, cannot be explained in terms of motion figure and magnitude alone, and involve the notion of substantial forms, 17.3-4 D The Discourse on metaphysics, 1686, introduces the new conception of individual sub stance, and suggests that the substantial forms needed to explain the laws of motion are akin to souls. But he does not show how substantial forms can explain the laws of motion; and he leaves in obscurity the relation of the substantial form, to the matter which along with substantial form constitutes the individual substance, 174-6 E There is a strong tendency in the Discourse toward the view that the created universe consists entirely of inextended substances which are minds with purely inner experiences. This would make 1 This paper deals with Leibniz's views up to I689. 8d</page><page sequence="93">RYLE Russell, L. J.-continued phenomena completely mental. Discussion of this, 176-8 F Leibniz also speaks as if there really were bodies outside us; but, as he always tried to show that the phrases used in ordinary life can be given a good meaning even though they are not literally accurate, his position here is not quite clear. The passages seem to indicate his readiness to go ahead with the examination of what is required if matter is to exist, 178-81 G In what sense does he speak of the 'system of phenomena' which God finds it good to produce? (Disc. 14), 181-2 H Evidence from the correspondence with Arnauld, 183-4 I Later thought, 185-6 J What is constant in the period up to 1689 is the arrangement of minds in space, mirroring the universe from their point of view, and the position that the universe they view is always the material universe of physical bodies in motion, though spirits can mirror God as well, 186 RYLE, G. 11 Thinking and language, Symposium (with J. Murdoch and A. C. Lloyd) Suppl XXV (1951), pp. 65-82 Synopsis: A To say of anyone that he thinks so or so, is not necessarily to say that he is busy now thinking it. But how shall we report the process philosophically, when he is? 65-6 B The metaphors we use in describing the events in such a process seem to fail us. Only what is common to a thinker "in a fog" and a traveller in one, would answer to the kind of literal description which we arc seeking, and we cannot reach what is thus common 66-7 C Of outer events (raging winds, etc.) our metaphorical accounts can, by contrast, be readily replaced by a literal ("Air Ministry") account. Why then the recalcitrance of thinking as a series of inner-events, to similar treatment? 67 D It is because the question "What are the constituents of the thinking process?" is incompetent. There is not anything which this process is always. It is a polymorphous conception, 67-9 E Thus, "the soul" is not "talking to itself" whenever thinking is going on, 69-70 F Does thinking always consist, perhaps, in operating-if not with words, then at least-with symbols ? 70-1 G But what, in the most familiar use of the term, are symbols? Are words symbols at all? 71-3 H The hopelessness of the effort to say what, in thinking, a p rson is al--ayvs doing, comes out specially clearly when we assemble the main objections to equating it with using language. It is not a case of the words (of the language) always "cropping up" in the tninker whern he thinks, any more than it is (always) a case of his "making use" of the words. "Makting use" leaves us with the question "what use"-to which the only answer is, for each thinker, a different particular inne; story-whether given in endless detail, or in bare plot, or in anything between these, 73-4 I The recourse to metaphor, in giving this story, is our effort to substitute history (of the inner life) for the mere chronicling of its details; this, in order to find (not further details but) what the same details amount to, 74ff J Metaphor as a present help in trouble, when one has to compare divergent instances of a polymorphous conception. It enables us, in describing each, to forbear detail and give what cotunts-as distinguished from adding more detail, 74-7 K Three sorts of thing which-. Mr. Llovd seems to want to distinguish as all being able to be said significantlv about a stretch of thinking, 77-80 L Is it a legitimate inference from this highly polymorphous character of the concept of thinking, that the current preoccupation of philosophers with language ("Philosophy is some sort of talk about talk") rests on a mistake? The misapprehension in this, 80-2 12 Pleasure, Symposium (with W. B. Gallie) Suppl. XXVIII (1954) pp. 135-46 Synopsis: A When undergoing a physical exercise, could one have some "enjoyment" along with it, precisely as one might have a headache along with it? Are anv difficulties implied in answering the question by a "Yes, of course"? 135 B (1) Such an answer need not imply that the pleasure or enjoyment is a speci.al bodily sensation like the headache. It might be a feeling not to be located here or there in the body, yet still a feeling, as a pain is or a tingle. The difficulty with this is that we should then be competent to ask of the enjoyment, as of the tingle, "was it enjoyed"; and thus 'was it enjoyed with an enjoyment, itself enjoyed with an enjoyment, etc. ad infinitum, 135-6 C (2) Even if our answer (Section A above) implied that thie enjoyment was a feeling, not of the. * headache" sort or "tingle" sort at all (whether, bodily or non-bodily) bu. such a feeling as wrath or alarm or disappoint- ment, there would remain the diificulty, even so, that your enjoyment of the exercise would not assail you as a panic would or a fit of mirth or furv-this, not because it is these in some mild version, but because it is not that sort of thing, 136-7 D (3) There are difficulties in the answer, even if the enjoyment is being equated to those "feelings" which we know familiarly as moods or frames of mind-e.g. irritabilitv. The enjoyment in question is in- commensurable with these also, 137-8 E The difficulties of the "Yes" answer to our question are not avoided bv those psvchologists who no longer speak about some special feeling which cnjoyment sunposedly is, but identify it with the "hedonic tone" (of the exercisc) in the exercising subject, 138-9 F A fresh point of attack upon the problem.

Is there any nuclear, one-piece notion, then, of attending?139 G The wide variety of things which, judging by our various idioms for it, this that we call "attending" seems to be. Is there anything which is the "attending" that seems to go along with the writing or the driving, when, as we say, we do these things with (much or little) attention? 139-42 H The position may be put thus: One of the many varieties which make up the polymorphous notion of "attending to" or "giving one's mind to" is enjoying; and this is why I cannot (logically) enjoy what I am oblivious of, 142 I We reach this (H, above) again, if we begin from a consideration of interest. Enjoyment (of any process) seems to imply giving of one's mind to something-giving it with that particuilar sort of interest which in fact constitutes enjoyment, 142-3 J Sundry considera- tions, further confirmatory of the view, 143-5 K Justification for the practice, in course of such considerations, of pressing into service, as evidence relevant to the problem, analogies or even plays upon words, 145-6 SAW, R. L. 3 Our knowledge of individuals, Vol. LII (1951-52), pp. 167-88 Synopsis: A Mutual support of empiricism and modern logic, as seen in (i) the 'bundle' theory of individuals, and (ii) the logical technique of eliminating singular terms, 167-8 B This latter technique allows us to question, sensibly, the existence of named particulars. But why may we not equally pose a question:- "Is 'God' a proper name?" The neutrality of logic, vis ai vis metaphysics, not necessarily an advantage. Metaphysicians might reason- ably ask that logic be adapted to their description of 'what there is'. Compare Leibniz, 168-71 C What is it that proper names name? (i) Mere ens? (ii) The total individual with all its properties? (iii) A specimen of a natural kind? The elimination of proper names is consistent with both the first two answers, and Leibniz seems to have given both. If 'Socrates is happy' is transformed into 'w is Socrates, and happy' the only possible argu- ments for the variable 'w' are empty or filled places in space-time, 171-5 D And predica- tion has disappeared; Socrates is related to his happiness as 'being together with it in the same place'. Uniqueness, in any individual, is contingent. There might be another similar set of properties in another place, 175-8 E Such a logic is not suited either to ordinary discourse or to historical statements. 'Growing acquaintance' with persons:- this is not knowledge of an increasing number of properties; nor is it to be expressed in a series of informative statements. The dichotomy of 'acquaintance with x' and 'knowing that some- thing about x is the case', leads to the dichotomy of informative and emotive uses of language, and so to a false account of aesthetic judgements, 178-82 F There are experts in the knowledge of persons, viz. poets, novelists, playwrights and historians. They, when they describe persons, present us with persons who act 'in character', i.e. they present a coherent picture. This coherence is of its own kind-neither logical nor causal. It is possible that the logical system which best expresses the structure of statements about persons is to be found in a logic such as that of F. H.

A species is a conjunction of two logically-interdependent terms, genus and differentia. A determinate is not a conjunction of its determinable and some other property independent of the determinable. Diagram, 141-3 C (II) The first criterion: specificity. (a) A rigorous criterion for the determinable-determinate relation, using the notions of term and entailment between terms. (b) The criterion satisfies the five essential conditions for any such criterion: (1) A determinate is a more specific form of its determinable. (2), (3) (4) determinable-determinate relation distinguished from other relations of specificity (5) There are different levels of the latter, e.g. 'scarlet' to 'red' vs. 'red' to 'colour'. (c) Weaknesses of a rigorous criterion of this sort for attacking ordinary language. The criterion is intended as an idealized model, not as a description, 144-51 D (III) The second criterion: resemblance with respect to (a) ordinary language, marks the determinable- determinate relation with a variation of the notion of resemblance.

N. 1 Gods, bliss and morality, Vol. LVIII (1957-58), pp. 59-78 Synopsis: A Aim of the paper: to give a general and rough description of the relations be- tween religious and moral discourse, 59-61 B Religious discourse. This is remarkable for its variegation:- some utterances concern a numinous object or objects of worship, 'beyond' the visible world. Others incarnate deities or sacred persons within the world. Others again concern a mystical state and the path to it. (I may call these respectively the numi- nous, the incarnation and the mystical strands of religious discourse.) These are sometimes woven together into a complex doctrinal scheme. We then get identification of entities with one another that are epistemologically disparate (e.g. Christ with the Creator, Brahman with Atman). These identifications rely on, and are backed by, appeal to loose resemblances. For present purposes, moral discourse may be regarded as a separate strand of religious discourse: we may then see how it becomes integrated with the others, 61-4 C We find that numinous concepts get to be superimposed on moral ones. Thus, e.g. worship is extended to cover daily conduct. Cf. the similar extension of sacrifice. The good as being the will of God; but this, because it has divine qualities, not simply because it is good, 64-71 D Belief in incarnation. The imitation of Christ in daily conduct; the new use of expressions like crucified, 71-4 E The mystical path illustrated from Buddhism. Its relation to moral rules and conduct, 74-7 F Conclusion: that morality does not presuppose religion but looks as if it did because of the resemblances, which can be appealed to by apologists to exhibit (not the necessary connexion but) the solidarity between morals and religion, 77-8 2 Paradox in religion, Symposium (with I.

His theory allows for the verifiability but not the falsifiability of doctrines, and this leads to perplexities, 225-6 E (iii) Ramsey's comparison between 'God' and 'I' is not as close as he suggests, 226-8 F God's transcendence may be inter- preted with reference to religious phenomenology, but the problem remains as to whether the notion is intelligible, since there is no way of going outside, or of arguing our way out- side, of the cosmos. Nevertheless, religious phenomenology indicates how the concept of God as 'beyond' the universe arises, 228-32 SMILEY, T. J. 1 Entailment and deduicibility, Vol. LIX (1958-59), pp. 233-54 Synopsis: A No definition of entailment can satisfy all the demands that we unreflectingly make because these are inconsistent. The 'paradoxes' of entailment come from assuming that the intuitive concept of entailment, based on 'connexion of meanings', will also have the property of transitivity, 233-5 B Discussion of the classical definition of logical consequence, 236-8 C An alternative definition of logical consequence proposed, in- tended to formalise the idea of entailment based on 'connexion of meanings' and hence to provide a criterion of what is or is not a 'paradoxcial' entailment, 238-43 D Criticism of the theory that only contingent propositions can entail or be entailed, 243-5 E Use- lessness of a non-transitive entailment as a logical instrument.

XXIV (1950), pp. 129-56 Synopsis: A Statements to be distinguished from the episodes of making them, as well as from the sentences in which they are made, 129-33 B Facts to be distinguished from objects and events. The words 'fact', 'statement', 'true', as ordinarily used, function to- gether within the general framework of a certain type of discourse (the empirically-informa- tive type). It is an illusion to suppose that the r6le of any of them, in this type of discourse, can be philosophically elucidated by definition in terms of the others; and it is a further illusion 'o supposc that the nature of tlhis type oif discourse can itself be elucidatcd in terms of thcsC words, 133-43 C Austin's theory of conventionai correspondcnce. understoodL as an attermpt to elucidace the rule of 'true', embodies a confusion bctween (i) the semantic conditions which must be satisfied for the statement that a certain statement is true to be it- self true, and (ii) what is asserted, when a certain statement is said to be true, 143-5 D Some uses of 'true', 'statement', 'fact', etc., in ordinary discourse described, 145-53 E Austin's own account of conventional correspondence applies only to certain simple kinds of statement, 153-5 F Summary of argument, 155-6 2 Partictl/ar anzd general, Vol. LIV (1953-54), pp. 233-60 Syniopsis: A Many different kinds of thing, besides 'qualities and relations', it would be natural to classify with these as general things, in contrast with particulars, 233-5 B Some accounts of the differences between general and particular things fail because of not taking 92</page><page sequence="97">TAYLOR Strawson, P. F.-continued account of this diversity. Others seem to reduce to the doctrine that particular things, unlike general, cannot have instances; but this is unexplanatory, in that the required notion of an 'instance' is a technical philosophical one, 235-8 C Certain things of which there can be instances have various kinds of name, which kinds can be compared and con- trasted: as material-names (e.g. 'gold'), substance-names (e.g. '(a) cat'), quality- or property- names (e.g. 'wisdom'), 238-40 D Criteria of distinctness and identity for a particular instance of a general thing, are necessary to the idea of such an instance; but they are not necessarily determined by the nature of the general thing in question, 241-2 E There are certain kinds of statement (e.g. 'music can be heard now', 'there is gold here') which do not mention particulars, but which do place features, (i.e. indicate incidence of some general things). The notion of a particular instance of some materials, and of some substances can, theoretically, be seen as the result of a logical composition of the notions of a feature and of placing; and thence as providing a location-point for an operation analogous to feature-plac- mg (i.e. property-ascription) and thence as yielding the notion of an instance of properties. Further composition yields further types of notion of a particular instance. Merits of this schema of explanation, 242-53 F Differences between substance-names and true general-thing-names explained in relation to D above, 253-5 G The explanatory schema not to be understood as laying down conditions for the possibility of mentioning particular instances, 255-6 H Necessary conditions of a thing's being general/particular (that it can/cannot be referred to by a singular substantival expression, a unique reference for which is determined by meaning alone) stated and explained, 256-60 3 Proper names, Symposium (with C. Lejewski), Suppl. XXXI (1957), pp. 191-228 Synopsis: A Aim of the paper: to explain the distinction between subject and predicate (or between reference and predication) and to find the rationale of the doctrine that spatio- temporal particulars can be referred to but not predicated, 191-3 B One distinction between subject-expressions and predicate-expressions is that whereas both may be said to introduce into the proposition items (terms) which the proposition may be said to be about, the predicate-expression introduces its term in a distinctively propositional style and the subject-expression does not. This distinction may be called 'the grammatical criterion', 193-7 C The grammatical interpretation of the distinction encourages a scepticism such as F. P. Ramsey's. It makes the distinction itself appear unnecessary, and the doctrine that particulars cannot be predicated appear arbitrary, 197-200 D The subject-predicate distinction can on the other hand be interpreted as founded on a funda- mental distinction of type or category, between the terms which can be introduced into propositions. This interpretation yields 'the category-criterion' of the distinction, and by this criterion it is necessarily true that particulars cannot be predicated, 200-6 E Ex- amples of cases in which tension might develop between the two criteria. These reveal the sort of linguistic provisions that we make to keep the two criteria apparently in line. It is as if there were felt to be an affinity between the two criteria, an appropriatness in their yielding the same result, 206-13 F The explanation of this affinity becomes possible if we consider a contrast between the conditions of identifying introduction of a particular into a proposi- tion, and the conditions of identifying introduction of a universal into a proposition. Intro- duction of a particular requires knowledge of an empirical fact which suffices to identify the particular, but introduction of a universal into a proposition does not necessarily require knowledge of any empirical fact, 213-19 G This contrast helps us to frame a broader distinction between 'complete' expressions, which identify their terms via knowledge of a fact, and 'incomplete' expressions which do not thus carry a weight of fact in introducing their terms. It is appropriate, on the one hand, that 'incomplete' expressions should have the manifest grammatical incompleteness of the propositional style of introduction. It is necessary, on the other hand, that expressions introducing particulars should be 'complete'. Thus a 'completeness-incompleteness' criterion for the subject-predicate distinction harmonises on the one hand with the grammatical criterion and on the other hand with the category criterion, and yields a rationale for the doctrine that particulars cannot be predicated, 219-22 H Further elucidation of the notion of 'completeness'. Its connection with 'presupposition' of fact. The identifying introduction of a particular into a proposition is the paradigm of reference, 223-8 TAYLOR, C. 1 Phenomenology and linguistic analysis, Symposium (with A. J. Ayer), Suppl.

E. 1 Dreams, Symposium (with A. R. Manser), Suppl. XXX (1956), pp. 197-207 Synopsis: A If there is a specifically philosophical problem about dreams, it is that of making clear the difference between dream-exerience and waking experiences, 197 B Dreams cannot be classified with illusions and hallucinations, as a deceptive form of experience, 197-204 C The problem, as formulated, arises only for a representative theory of perception, 204-5 D Dreaming is not a form of perceiving. Like imagining and day- dreaming, it is a 'seeming to perceive', 205-6 E Conclusion: there is no specifically philosophical problem about dreams in the sense suggested, 206-7 THOMSON, J. F. 1 Reducibility, Symposium (with G. J. Warnock and R. B. Braithwaite), Suppl. XXVI (1952), pp. 87-104 Synopsis: A In reducibility-claims, of the form 'X's are reducible to Y's', 'X' and 'Y' are usually category-words. Thus, 'number', 'proposition', etc. are category-words. To say that a thing is of such-and-such a category, is to refer indirectly to the kinds of thing that can be significantly said about it, 87-8 B Numbers, classes, propositions, etc. are some- times said to be 'abstract objects'. Those who use this phrase would explain 'abstract' as meaning something like 'intangible'. But of numbers, etc. it does not make sense to say either that they are tangible or that they are intangible. Hence to call numbers 'abstract' is already a category-mistake, 88-90 C Nominalists wish to be able to say 'there are primes between 1,000 and 1,010' without being committed to saying 'there are numbers'; and thus claim that numerical statements are really about classes (or about numerals). But the logistic reduction of arithmetic to set-theory cannot be allowed to have the philosophical importance here claimed for it. For (i) arithmetical operations cannot be performed directly upon classes, and (ii) if Russell's representation of cardinal numbers by classes of similar classes were allowed to show that numbers are classes of classes; then other equally possible methods of representation would have to be allowed to show that numbers are also quite different kinds of thing, e.g. iterates of a certain function, 91-5 D (Finite cardmal) numbers are what we get from 0 by successively adding 1; we can explain 'successively' by Frege's device of the ancestral. This is a genuine and philosophically helpful, explana- tion of the category number; for, since arithmetical operations are defined by recursion, it points to the method of proof and disproof appropriate to numerical statements, 95-7 E Further, one can ask where a particular number is; the answer will be to give its place in the number-sequence. But one cannot ask where numbers are in general, any more than one can ask where, in general, material objects are. ('Material objects are in physical space' is informative, only if taken as reminding us that it must make sense to ask of a 94</page><page sequence="99">TUCKER Thompson, J. F.-continued material object where in space it is, i.e. as a statement which elicits the nature of the category material object), 97-8 F That there are numbers, is shown by the fact of there being numerical statements; and it is not part of what is stated in numerical statements. To know what numbers are, it is sufficient to be able to operate intelligently with numerals. To say 'there are numbers' is thus to say (misleadingly) that there are the established uses that there are, for numerical sentences, 99-101 G A similar situation holds for such other category-existence-claims as 'there are material objects', 'there are propositions', etc. One will only wish to argue about such claims, if one has made the mistake of supposing that a statement S entails that those conditions have been satisfied, which have to be satisfied if a sentence can be used to make that statement S, 102-4 TINT, H. 1 Heidegger and 'the irrational', Vol. LVII (1956-57), pp. 253-68 Synopsis: A Sein u. Zeit was apparently intended by Heidegger as prolegomenon to his philosophy proper. Our concern at present is with the latter. It has to be pieced together from the author's post-1927 writings, 253 B His denial of the empirical world and repudiation of the logic relevant to it, 253-5 C Being as reality, and how it differs from the empirical world, 255-6 D 'Overtness' as link between man and being; being, for Heidegger, not wholly knowable, 256-7 E Moods as partially revealing the nature of being; meaning of 'dread', 'boredom', 'nothing', 257-9 F Heidegger's paradoxical views on the nature of science, 259-60 G His 'nothing' vis d vis negation in logic, 260 H Being, defined as all-that-there-is, 261-2 I Heidegger's attempt to reconcile the in- ternal determiaism and infinity of being, with human freedom and finitude, 262-5 J The charge of 'irrationalism'. This always hazardous. 'Rational' as a predicate signifying ap- proval, 265-8 K But the necessary inconclusiveness of speculation about being, hardly constitutes sufficient ground for approving Heidegger's doctrine, 268 TOULMIN, S. 1 Knowledge of right and wrong, Vol. L (1949-50), pp. 139-56 Synopsis: A Questions about our knowledge of right and wrong have often been discussed in terms of a 'moral sense', 'intuition', or 'rational faculty'. Is this necessary? 139-41 B Claims to knowledge can give rise either to logical questions (about grounds) or to biographical questions (about origins) according as justification or back-history is called for, 141-5 C In two different classes of situation, an assertion may be accepted as justified even if the claimant can produce no grounds; but the distinctions between these two classes are crucial-in one case there is, in the other there is not, room to talk of 'intuition' and the like, 145-9 D The idea of 'rational faculties of immediate apprehension' arises from confusing these two classes of situation, and thinking of knowledge in an over-psychological manner, 149-51 E The results of this analysis applied to our knowledge of moral principles, showing how the essential question is 'what grounds for our moral conclusions constitute good moral reasons?', 151-6 2 Probability, Symposium (with L. J. Russell), Suppl. XXIV (1950), pp. 27-62 Synopsis: A The paper aims to throw light on the philosophy of probability, by studying the connections between the practical situations in which words like 'probable' are used, and the corresponding theoretical analyses, 27-8 B The word 'probably' is characteristically used as a way of guarding an assertior, so as not to commit the speaker unreservedly: it is a counterpart to the phrase 'I know', which reinforces the commitment; and both terms reflect the strength or adequacy of the speaker's grounds, 28-35 C Deviations between the characteristic uses of the word 'probable', and the theoretical analysis given by W. Kneale in his Probability and induction, 35-40 D A distinction between 'improper claims' and 'mistaken claims', brings out the different ways in which probability-claims may fail through being insufficiently grounded or trustworthy. It is shown how our ways of judging such claims change inevitably as time goes on, 40-6 E The philosophy of probability should not be concerned with the search for a tangible counterpart (referent) for the word 'probability', 46-50 F If it is so concerned, one will be led into a fallacy akin to what G. E. Moore signalises as the 'naturalistic fallacy', 50-6 G This point can be illustrated from Kneale's argument. The view that there are two senses of the word 'probability' must be criticised as being too easy a way out, 56-62 TUCKER, J. 1 Godel and Epimenides, Vol. LIX (1958-59), pp. 25-48 Synopsis: A The paper is intended to show that G6del's results are devoid of the philoso- phical significance which has been claimed for them; and in particular, that they have no connection whatever with the paradoxes. Godelian sentences are straightforward cases of 95</page><page sequence="100">URMSON Tucker, J.-continued successful self-description. They introduce no new principle of self-description, and they differ from more familiar cases of it only in complexity. The method of arithmetisation, which is their distinctive feature, provides no more than a backing to the description, which ensures that it is successful; it guarantees the existence of a certain complicated case of self- description. What it does not do, is produce some new and hitherto unknown effect on a sentence of Epimenidean form. It would be rediculous to maintain that we need such complex cases in order to be able to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful self-description; and ridiculous to maintain that anything so complex as a Godelian sentence could throw light on anything so simple as an Epimenidean sentence, 25-6 B An outline of the argument for the existence of undecidable formulae. Godel's views as to the relevance of this argument to the paradoxes. The undecidable sentence as a successful case of self- description; as such, it is nothing new, and throws no light on the paradoxes. The general result which establishes the existence of undecidable sentences, is made up of arithmetical expressions; no new principle is introduced, 26-33. C A Godelian sentence, as a formula of recursive arithmetic, does just what it does do; it needs no interpretation. Difficulties arise over such sentences, only in respect of what they 'say'; and what they have been in- terpreted as 'saying', has been conditioned by the Epimenidean model to which they have so frequently been assimilated. What one cannot offer as the interpretation of a Godelian sentence, is one which is Epimenidean in form and so without content. To do so can only result in giving the impression that content is miraculously conferred upon it, bv the inner mvsteries of recursive arithmetic. Yet such Epimenidean interpretations have often been given. Some of these, with the mistakes involved in them, 33-4 D It follows that Find- lay's G is not different in kind from simpler and more ordinary Epimenidean sentences, being a rather more complicated concoction of the old ingredients. To think that by under- standing G, one thoroughly understands Godel's result, is to miss out the recursive structure of which 'G' is a description, 36-7 E If the view that a Godelian sentence is an iso- graphic coincidence between two different 'languages' were correct, it would deprive Godel's results of all significance. For if the same signs really 'play different roles in different languages', then what they do in one of them cannot have any bearing on what they do in another. Godelian sentences are not self-referring at all, but self-describing. No referring expressions occur in them; nothing corresponding to the 'this', in 'this sentence is un- provable', is to be found. The significance of Godel's work is for number theory. In philosophy, simpler wvays of thinking have been found, 37-48 URMSON, J. 0. 1 Motives and cauises, Symposium (with R. S. Peters and D. J. McCracken), Suppl. XXVI (1952), pp. 179-94 Sytnopsis: A I propose to make a few independent comments on our subject, and then a few on my fellow symposiasts' positions, 179 B Set down some questions that might naturally be asked about a person's action (short of the very wide one, 'why did he do it?') questions such as 'what was the point?', 'what was his reason?', 'what led him (to do it)?', 'how came it about?', 179 C Approximately speaking, these are questions of different types. The answer which each invites, as appropriate to it, when it is put concerning any action, is roughly of its own type. And answers appropriate to some, in the list, would be incongruous as answers to certain of the others, 179-80 D Of the same action (say A's buying of some article) we can usually ask more than one of these eight questions. We may ask what the point was, what the agent's reason was, what prompted him to buy this thing, how it came about that he did it, etc. And here we have to note that the appropriate answer to one of the questions may sometimes prevent certain of the other questions from arising. Thus, having heard what made A do something, we cannot go on to ask afterwards what the point of it was. If the agent had to do it, we have conceded that there was no point. If we do push the question, we are refusing to admit that he was made to act so. We are putting the question as it were forensically, 180-2 E There are weaker and stronger among the questions. Although, having put the question to someone 'what led you to?' one could not quite easily, one yet could more easily, go on to 'what was your reason?' than if one had first asked 'what possessed you to?'. Again, when anyone is 'led' to do this or that, the expression suggests traits in his character, idiocyncracies or the like. A hint concerning the what prompted? and the how came it about? questions, 182-3 F One general conclusion: you cannot discuss the relation of motive to act, without special restrictions on the blanket term 'motive', 183-5 G Having thus in part exhibited the method which, in examining motives I think rightly to be adopted, I turn to questions which the previous papers raise. As to 'underlying' motives, clearly (i) there are such; but this does not logically involve either of the positions currently associated with psycho-analysis, viz. that there are always such, and that they are always of one or another of a few different ultimate sorts, 185-6 H (ii) Mr. Peters' views about motives 'causing' actions. Even if he finds a natural law about (say) boys and accessible apples and hunger and stealing, by which, given the first three he could deduce the fourth (concerning some particular boy on a given 96</page><page sequence="101">VESEY Urmson, J. O.-continued occasion) we must still ask whether he is explaining what made the boy do it, or what led (prompted, etc.) him to? Mr. Peters cannot assume that a 'causal' explanation., to the effect that the agent was made to do the act, can be always given; still less that explanation in such terms would alone be explanation. Or does he think that the distinction between 'motive' as inner compulsion, and 'motive' as the reason for, the act (or what led to it, prompted it, etc.) is unimportant? 186-91 I Of Mr. McCracken it is difficult to understand either (i) his regarding the agent himself, or his character, as 'causing' the action; or (ii) his ardour for ranking motives with anything so vague as 'causes'; as though this were to confer a certain logical or other status upon them, 191-3 J While the nature of motives is an important question, it would seem that to ask whether they are causes or not is but a barren approach to it, 193-4 2 Recognition, Vol. LVI (1955-56), pp. 259-80 Synopsis: A The 'recognition' which is here proposed for discussion, viz. (i) of a kind, (ii) of an individual, 259 B (i) In recognizing things as of a certain kind, we recognize by some feature, not by some merely external clue-a feature characteristic of the kind and accessible to observation, 259-63 C Is recognition pre-verbal? The case for saying that in order to recognize something as an 'X', we must understand the word 'X', 263-5 D An insubstantial objection to this essentially-correct contention:- insubstantial, for one must not confuse noticing a similarity in things with recognizing their kind, 265-8 E Some further difficulties in the principle "to recognize something as an 'X' requires an understanding of the word 'X' "-difficulties, from a due study of which, it would appear that while the principle thus expressed is an over-statement (a rather drastic one, even) it yet over-states a basically sound position, 268-72 F How do we recognize the features themselves, by which we recognize a number of given things as being of a kind? In any case independent recognition of them is not necessary to recognition of kind, 272-5 G Price is mistaken when he says that to possess a concept is to have the capacity of recognizing its instances. It is doubtless necessary to be able somehow to identify t:em, 275-7 H (ii) Recognition of individuals. Recognizing as an individual, like recognizing as an 'X', is not pre-verbal; though recognizing an individual probably can be, 277-80 3 What makes a situation aesthetic? Symposium (with D. L. Pole), Suppl. XXXI (1957), pp. 75-92 Synopsis: A The problem: what distinguishes situations that are aesthetic from other satisfactions, moral, economic, intellectual, etc.? 75-6 B It cannot be their arising from some specially delimited class of objects; 76-7 C or from a special feature in objects, such as beauty or ugliness; or from some constituent of the emotions of the observer, 77 D Prima facie likelihood that a satisfaction's being aesthetic (or economic, or . . . etc.) will depend on the kind of considerations that would explain it. This fits for the others, and should fit for aesthetic satisfactions too, 77-8 E The logical relations between 'aesthetic', 'moral', 'economic', etc., as predicates of satisfactions or appraisals. These already suggest affinity among the criteria for all of them, 78-80 F And, as we find we cannot separate aesthetic reactions from moral, economic, etc., so we find that we cannot isolate one aesthetic reaction (say, delight) from others, 80-3 G As the question whether a reaction, appreciation or appraisal is aesthetic or not, is a question of what evoked (and so explains) it -so the task of the philosopher, here, must be to say in principle, in each case, what does evoke this specific sort of appraisal, 83ff H What he (the philosopher) should study, for the case of aesthetic appraisal; namely, the practice of those who try to discriminate aesthetic appraisal from other kinds (cf. Matthew Arnold's correction of the Wordsworthians), 84-6 I One outstanding difficulty of saying in principle what is relevant to an aesthetic appraisal- complexity, in the examples which naturally occur to us, of what we value aesthetically, 86-8 J In principle, however, (at least in the simpler cases) what evokes the appreciation can be seen to be the way an object looks (or the way it presents itself to the other senses), 89-90 K Summary, 90-1 L Appendix, on the place still reserved for a consideration of the emotions, in aesthetics, 91-2 VESEY, G. N. A. 1 Seeing and seeing-as, Vol. LVI (1955-56), pp. 109-24 Synopsis: A In one sense of 'looks like', what an object 'looks like' to anyone is what, on seeing it, he would take it actually to be, except he had reason to think otherwise, 109-10 B There is another sense of the expression (that in which an inkblot may look like an organist playing an organ). In this sense a thing seen may not 'look like' anything whatever: although, in the first sense, it does and must. For it is seen; and anything seen looks, in this sense, like something, All seeing is seeing-as, 110-13 C Perceptions are true or false, according to whether the things perceived are or are not what they look like. But they do not 'involve judgments'; since it is false that I always judge things to be what they look like to me.

A.-continued involved in all perceptions; a judgment, not about the material thing perceived, but about a certain non-material thing called a 'sense-datum', 114-16 D Some philosophers, seeing that perception occurs only under conditions (such as the perceiver's point of view, and the state of his nervous system) conclude that we are never really aware of the material world, 116-19 E It is because they occur under conditions, that perceptions are true or false. A sense-datum is conceived to be something of which awareness is not under conditions, 119-20 F This would make the sense-datum something of which one is aware without being aware of it as anything, in which case it could not be evidence for any judgment, 121-2 G If we do not say that differences in point of view prevent us from being aware of the same thing why should we say that differences in the perceivers' physiology do? 122-3 H Con- clusion, 123-4 WALSH, W. H. 2 Analytic-synthetic, Vol. LIV (1953-54), pp. 77-96 Synopsis: A The object of the paper:- to consider certain criticisms of the analytic- synthetic distinction. Criticisms by Quine and Waismann. Differences in their points of view, 77-81 B Both are troubled by difficulties in applying the term 'analytic'. Both produce cases which seem to cut across the distinction. The difficulty, here, arises-at least partly-from taking these cases out of context. In order to determine whether a speaker intends what he says to be analytically true or no;, we must consider his words as he says them, and not in the abstract. 'Analytic' and 'synthetic' qualify 'true' and 'false', and 'true' and 'false' apply not to sentences but to statements, 82-7 C Quine will not separate the verbal component in knowledge from the factual, and embody the formor in analytic statements. This appears to rest on a false understanding of what is 'true by definition'. Definition is formally distinct from statement of fact, but a definition can still be framed with an eye to facts. What is taken as analytically true may, as it were, indirectly reflect a reading of the facts, 87-92 D Waismann's misgivings depend on his view that empirical concepts are of 'open texture', and so cannot be said to have precise bounds. The facts, here, must be admitted; but notice, first, that though exactly-delimited empirical concepts are impossible, to tighten up our conceptual systems and avoid ambiguity may often be desirable, and this is what we do when we make clear to ourselves what we regard as analytically true; and second, that in order to do this we do not require to frame definitions in the abstract, but can proceed from case to case as in English law, 92-6 WARNOCK, G. J. 1 Metaphysics in logic, Vol. LI (1950-51), pp. 197-222 Synopsis: A Some modem logicians raise the issue of nominalism versus Platonism. The supposed central question, 'are there abstract entities?' is not clear, nor usually clearly discussed, 197-9 B The question 'what is there?', if taken seriously, must prove un- profitable, 200-1 C The alternative, 'what expressions have designative uses?' cannot be answered by formal tests, and the belief that it can be, appears to imply an over-simplifica- tion of the problem which renders nominalism, in particular, plainly absurd, 201-8 D Standard interpretations of the existential quantifier, particularly if combined with general reliance on the theory of descriptions, may seem to raise an insoluble problem as to what it is to which all properties are ascribed, 208-13 E Other problems to which the theory of descriptions may seem to lead, 213-6 F In natural language many sorts of sentences, which might all more or less roughly be called 'existential', differ importantly in their uses and implications. Logicians' questions atout 'ontology' are liable to be confused, owing to their obliteration of these distinctions by the use of just one symbolic device, 217-21 G The interpretation of formalized expressions into natural language raises questions which are typically philosophical, not logical. Logicians cannot by-pass or neglect these questions, 221-2 2 Reducibility, Symposium (with J. F. Thomson and R. B. Braithwaite), Suppl. XXVI (1952), pp. 105-20 Synopsis: A The errors of realists and nominalists cannot usefully be said to be all 'category- mistakes', nor are all arguments about reducibility of the same sort, 105-7 B It is true in general that 'Platonistic' doctrines appear to sever existing connections between different though related ways of speaking, and 'reductionism' in general is a natural re-action against this. But there is no single procedure by which all such problems can be resolved, 107-14 C There is also a general tendency to mis-construe all substantival expressions on the supposed analogy of reference to particular concrete objects; and by reaction, to suppose that reference to such objects is the only ultimately satisfactory way of speaking, 114-16 D Phenomenalism is a special case.

XXXI (1957), pp. 43-58 Synopsis: A Emotions should be distinguished (a) from feelings, (this word has too vague a meaning to allow of its profitable discussion) (b) from passions in Hume's sense, (the difference here is not great) and (c) from attitudes, 43-4 B Calm passions in Hume's sense. Their justification can be seen to be intelligible: we justify them as we should justify a moral judgment, 44-5 C But it is not absolutely clear that what we are here justifying is the passion itself, 45-6 D Passions should not be confused with attitudes, 46-9 E Emotion-words are different from attitude-words. There are some things like 'fondness for . . . ' which do not easily fit into either class, 49-50 F An attitude, like a calm passion, implies thought and beliefs; which makes its justification intelligible, 50-1 G The question must next be raised about the nature of justification. Justification of an emotion is something offered in order to counter an accusation, either that it was too great for the circumstances, or was totally uncalled for, or was unsuitable to the circumstances, 51-4 H In some cases to defend an emotion from these charges is to justify it. Con- clusion: there may be some emotions (e.g. love) where we are not inclined to try justification. But where we do try it, the method is to show that people generally agree (or would if they thought about it) that the object was worth the emotion evoked, 54-8 WATKINS, J. W. N. I Epistemology and politics, Vol. LVIII (1957-58), pp. 79-102 Synopsis: A The paper calls in question the popular thesis that, logically, philosophical ideas have no relevance to political ideas, 79-80 B First, metaphysical ideas may in- directly sanction certain favoured moral and political doctrines, 80-3 C Next, Hume's epistemology has implications which conflict with certain presuppositions of parliamentary democracy. Like a court of law, democracy presupposes disagreement, but disagreement need not involve serious mutual distrust, 83-8 D Hume's empiricism implies that error is wilful: serious disagreement must be the result of some deception, 88-95 E Con- dorcet carries this further and concludes that a social revolution is needed to destroy the sources of error, 95-6 F Classical empiricism suggests a unanimous and progressive self-governing commumty, as the political ideal, 97-8 G But the hypothetico-deductive view of science shows that intellectual advances involve intellectual risks, that refutations and disputes are as inherent in scientific activity as they are in legal and democratic activities- there is nothing sinful about error, and a progressive and unanimous community is an impossible ideal, 100-2 H Thus philosophical thinking does have a logical relevance to political ideas, 102 99</page><page sequence="104">WATLING WATLING, J. 1 Inference from the known to the unknown, Vol. LV (1954-55), pp. 83-108 Synopsis: A The first of two arguments which lead to scepticism or to phenomenalism, 83 B Evidence and knowledge. Whatever reasons there are for supposing that the assertion 'this is known' requires 'this' to be 'based upon good evidence' are also reasons for supposing that 'this is known' requires 'this' to be 'entailed by good evidence'. But if 'this is known' does require 'this is entailed by good evidence', then very little that is called knowledge is in fact knowledge. So far, the sceptical argument is correct, 84-6 C Its fault. This lies in its assumption that the reason why our assertions about the future count as knowledge is that they are based upon good evidence. This is not so. For knowing facts is an ability, like knowing how to ride a bicycle; knowing facts is an ability to tell the truth, as the other is an ability to balance, 87-8 D Therefore whether a person knows a fact does not depend upon evidence he can bring, but upon whether he has the ability referred to, the ability to tell the truth about this or other such facts as this, 89-93 E An example: the problem of other minds, 93-7 F Having knowedge thus depends neither upon an a priori justification nor upon a justification by experience, 98 G A second argument (that of the verification principle) that we cannot have direct knowledge of e.g. physical objects or other minds, and hence cannot speak meaningfully about them, 98-101 H There is no such thing as verifying a proposition in the sense of finding out, beyond logical possibility of error, whether it is true or false, 101-4 I It follows that my knowledge of the events of your mind is not logically inferior to your knowledge of them, though mine is knowledge by inference and yours is not. In both, error is logically possible, 104-6 J Direct knowledge and verification do not exist. They are ideal illusions. Therefore it is no objection to our knowledge of physical objects and other minds that we do not have direct knowledge of them, 107-8 2 Entaillnent, Symposium (with C. Lewy and P. T. Geach), Suppl. XXXII (1958), pp. 143-56 Synopsis: A Dr. Lewy rejects the paradoxical conclusions of his arguments; so he has to explain why the arguments are not cogent when they seem so, and why they seem so when they are not. He does this by distinguishing two senses of entailment: in one, 'necessitation', he believes the premises to hold but the conclusions not to follow, 'necessitation' not being transitive: in the other, 'entailment', he believes one of the premises not to hold, 143-5 B But necessitation is transitive. Hence Lewy cannot accept the premises and reject the conclusions of his arguments, 145-6 C His definition of 'is a good reason for' has the consequence that no necessary or contradictory proposition can provide, or be provided with, a good reason; further, that no necessary or contradictory proposition can entail, or be entailed by, any other proposition, 1468 D This consequence is not a fault in Lewy's definition of entailment. To be told that it is both raining and not raining is to be told nothing. Since in each dilemma one of the premises does state that a necessary proposition entails another proposition, neither dilemma provides any reason for the view that entail- ment is not transitive, 148-50 E Lewy's definition of 'entailment' is unsatisfactory. It excludes entailments which hold, and allows those which do not, 150-2 F The reasons for distinguishing 'entailment' from 'necessitation' are not valid: Lewy mistakes the fact that 'provable from' is not transitive, for the fact that 'entailment' is not transitive, 152-4 G The conclusions of the dilemmas must be rejected. A necessary proposition is 'assumed' in the arguments, but it is not these 'assumptions' which make the arguments invalid. Arguments of the form "from 'p and not p' to 'p' " are no less invalid than those of the form "from 'p and not p' to 'q' ", 154-6 *WELDON, T.

XXIX (1955), pp. 115-30 Synopsis: A The subject,-justification of principles of action in politics, 115-16 B Con- texts in which 'on principle' only means 'according to a rule of behaviour deliberately adopted', 116-18 C In political contexts it still means this, though the rule is of the kind considered to be essential to a certain way of life, 118-22 D Is it the case that, in acting politically 'on principle', the rule followed and the way of life it supports are derivable from something more ultimate? Difficulties, and yet a truth in this suggestion, 122-4 E How the political principles adopted are correlated with ways of envisaging the total political scene, 124-8 F To 'justify' one set of such principles as against another is only possible within some such agreed totality of view, 128-9 G Summary, 129-30 WHITE, A.

Bedford) Suppl. XXXIII (1959), pp. 57-72 Synopsis: A The fact that we can be pleased at what we believe to be the case but is not the case, raises the question of the relation of pleasure to its objects. This relation is not causal. Neither the object, nor the belief in the object, is, as such, the cause of the pleasure. In particular, I cannot in the same way be mistaken in stating the object of my pleasure as I can be mistaken in stating a causal hypothesis, 57-9 B Pleasure and activity.

I may be mistaken about, or misdescribe; that to which I say that my attention has been drawn; this, in the same four ways as in the case of 'pointing to'. There are cases that do not arise with 'pointing to': (i) I can have my attention drawn to, a feature of my experience which I know to be illusory; and (ii) I can know that x attracted my attention, but not know what it was about x that attracted my attention. The peculiar fact that I seem, in some cases, to be able to become certain by reflection, what it was about x that drew my attention. Distinction of cases in which my attention is drawn: (a) where I already had a relevant expectation, hope, or similar attitude, (b) where I did not, 63-6 E The six types of case discussed for 'having my attention drawn to', have each an analogy in the relation of pleasure to its objects, 66-8 F The problem of such pleasure as is based on false beliefs about the past or future; distinction of several different cases under this head. Possible analogy between (i) objects of attention where there was an antecendent expectation, etc., and (ii) objects of pleasure where there was an antecedent desire, 68-70 G The analogies between attention and pleasure, as being not merely analogies: pleasure itself as a mode of attention. The specific differences of this mode of attention remain to be explained, 70-2 WINCH, P. 1 Authority, Symposium (with R. S. Peters and A. E. Duncan-Jones), Suppl. XXXII (1958), pp. 225-40 Synopsis: A What sort of unity is characteristic of a human society? Dr. Peters correctly holds that the concept of authority is central to an account of this. It is thereby linked up with some of the most fundamental questions of philosophy. But all this is obscured if authority is misinterpreted as some kind of influence-(a mistake analogous to that of treating knowledge as a peculiar kind of belief), 225-7 B Human interaction in society essentially involves communication. The latter presupposes agreed rules of behaviour in the sense analysed by Wittgenstein. To follow such rules is to accept some authority on the correct way to behave, 227-8 C Where X has authority over Y (as opposed to power) there is an internal relation between them. We can only characterize a particular instance of this relation in terms of the ideas which give form to the activity in which X and Y are participating, 229-30 D Authority is not antithetical to freedom of choice. For choosing involves acting from reasons; such action presupposes rule-governed activities; and rule- governed activities are inconceivable without authority, 231-2 E This is not to say that all authority is accepted voluntarily. Our participation in rule-governed activities is not in general itself a matter of choice. Political authority and that of adults over children: here too (despite appearances) acceptance of authoity is somehow a precondition of participation in voluntary activity, 233-5 F Action. What counts as the 'right' way to act is not always agreed unambiguously, e.g. in politics. Still, we cannot dispense with this idea in accounting for political authority, 235-7 G Difficulties in Dr. Peters" 'de facto' and in Weber's 'charismatic' authority. Both seem to misinterpret its relation to tradition and to rationality, 237-9 H Peters' account of authority in terms of its external marks. It fails for the same reasons as does Descartes' account of knowledge in terms of the 'cleamess and distinctness' of ideas, 239-40 WISDOM, J. 0. 4 Mentality in machines, Symposium (with R. J. Spilsbury and D. M. Mackay), Suppl. XXVI (1952), pp. 1-26 Synopsis: A Artifacts such as radar contain feed-backs that make them self-correcting in operation. They thus reproduce 'adaptive' behaviour. Many functions of human bodies can be reproduced in an artifact. The problem is whether mental functioning also can be, using the same sort of mechanisms, 1-7 B It may be that purely physiological behaviour can be wholly reproduced. Can the mental phenomena that are displayed in it? And, if there are mental phenomena that are not displayed in behaviour, can they be reproduced? A fundamental distinction to be drawn between physiological behaviour (illustrated by wrinkled foreheads) and personal behaviour (illustrated by frowns). The question is whether the latter is reproducible, 8-15 C In contrast with an artifact, a human being adopts an attitude, which is interpretative-i.e. something is recognised and something anticipated. There is also a valuational element. These involve imagining. Characteristics of imagining described. The question now arising: can we reproduce imagination-phenomena in an artifact? In particular this involves having an artifact that could imagine itself somewhere else, 15-25 D The conclusion arrived at-that these typically mental phenomena (the wanting of things and imagining of things) can probably not be reproduced in an artifact with the mechanisms so far known to us, 25-6 102</page><page sequence="107">WISDOM WISDOM, J. T. 7 The concept of mind, Vol. L (1949-50), pp. 189-204 Synopsis: A This paper seeks-not to review Ryle's book but,-via criticism, to continue it, 189 B Ryle's theme is what he calls the myth of the ghost in the machine. Wittgenstein spoke of 'the idea that the soul is a little man within'. Much of what Ryle says reminds us of what Wittgenstein said. But, unlike Wittgenstein, Ryle never adequately recognises the difference between the method of verification proper to statements about mental things and that proper to statements about material things, 189 C Ryle does not mean that all statements about mental processes are false because no such processes occur. He means that statements about mental processes are related to statements descriptive of their bodily manifestations, as statements about the manoevres of a division are related to statements descriptive of the movements of its members, and not as statements about a man behind the scenes are related to statements about the activities of his minions, 189-91 D We note by the way here that Ryle, like William James, appears not to notice the difference between (a) setting out the relations between (i) statements about thoughts, wishes, emotions and (ii) statements about the sensations, the headaches, heartaches and mental pictures, through which the thoughts and emotions are manifest to introspection, and (b) setting out the rela- tions between (i) any statements about mind, whether about emotion and thought or about sensations, and (ii) statements about the bodily processes through which mental states of whatever kind are manifest to external observation, 191-3 E The purpose of removing misapprehension of the relation between statements about minds and those about bodies is to remove the difficulties we sometimes feel about (i) how the body acts on the mind and vice versa and(ii) howone mind knows another through its bodily manifestations, 192 F The peculiarity of statements about mind which gives rise to these difficulties is a feature which is referred to by dhe words 'a person has a way of knowing how he feels which no one else has', 193-6 G It is easy to misdescribe this feature, 197-200 H It is also easy to describe it: A sensation as of pain gives B a right to answer the question 'is B in pain ?' which such a sensation does not give to A in connexion with this question about B, 200 I It is not unnatural to try to express this by saying that one can never have all the reason one could have for a statement about the mind of another, and then to say that one can never know such a statement to be true, 200-1 J But this is to misrepresent a remarkable idio- syncrasy in statements about mind, without which they would not be themselves, as being an unhappy inability on our part to attain to a knowledge of each other to which we conceivably could attain, 201-3 K How far we do attain to what we might, is a question not of metaphysics but of fact, 204 8 Metaphysics, Vol. LI (1950-51), pp. i-xxiv Synopsis: A If someone who says 'there is blood on this dagger' means to assert not merely that to him at the moment there appears to be blood on a certain dagger but that there is blood on that dagger, then whether or no to another person, B, there appears to be blood on the dagger is no less relevant than whether or no to A there appears to be blood on that dagger; and if later, inexplicably, it appears to them that there is no blood on the dagger, they may properly ask themselves whether there ever really was any blood on that dagger, i-ii B Imagine that to someone, A, it looks as if there is blood on a certain dagger and that it feels, smells and tastes to him as if there were blood on that dagger, and that it sounds to him as if everyone were saying 'there's blood on that dagger', and that in every way it appears to him that it appears to others as well as to himself that there is blood on that dagger. There is an inclination to say that no-one at any time has better reason to assert that something is so, than has someone to whom, as to A, it appears in every way at the time as if it were so, iii, v-vi C Nevertheless there is also an inclination to say that even a person to whom, as to A, it appears in every way that such and such a thing is so, has not that reason which another person could have, nor that reason which he himself could have at another time, iii-iv D And, struck by this, we may feel inclined to say that even one to whom it appears in every way that S is P, has not every reason one could have to assert that S is P, has not reasons sufficient to prove that S is P, does not really know that S is P, v-vi cf vii-ix E To this, however, we may feel inclined to reply: No. A person to whom at a time, t, it appears in every way in which it could to him at t appear that S is P, has every reason one could have for the statement S is P, iii-iv, cf vii-ix F We may try to meet this conflict by saying "the words 'A person to whom at a time, t, it appears in every way it could appear to him at that time that S is P, has every reason one could have for the statement that S is P' may mean (a) that such a person at such a time has every reason he at that time could have for the statement S is P, and may mean (b) that such a person at such a time has every reason anyone could have at any time for the statement S is P. (b) is false, (a) is true," ix-xi G But a difficulty remains. For we are inclined to say that what is reason for one person is reason for another and what is reason at one time is reason at another. Surely in saying that the smoke coming from a certain building gives, in itself or in the light of experience, reason to a person, A, to believe what he expresses by the words 'it's on fire', we imply that that smoke would, in itself or in the light of like experience, do the same for any person who 103</page><page sequence="108">WOLHEIM Wisdom, J. T.-continued meant the same by the words 'it's on fire'. Surely, in general, whatever phenomena, incidents, facts, items of information, or data, we speak of as giving to a particular person, A, reason to believe what he expresses by a form of words 'S is P' must do the same for anyone, B, who means the same by the words 'S is P'. Of course if what A means is different from what B means then it is quite possible that what gives A reason for what he means could not give B reason for what he means, xi cf. xi-.xii, and xiii-xiv H Sometimes words used to make statements as to what is so mean different things to different people in that quite normal sense of the word 'meaning' in which, e.g., 'I gave him a drink' may mean one thing to one person and something different to another. But words used to make statements as to what is so always can, and often do, mean the same thing to different people. They do not mean something different even in the eccentric sense of the word 'meaning' in which one says 'Jack feels cold' means something different to Jack from what it does to Jill because a sensa- tion of cold plays a part when Jack acknowledges the truth of these words about Jack which such a sensation could not play for Jill. And if we say that in a sense of the word 'meaning' any form of words 'S is P' used to make a statement as to what is so always means something different to one person, A, from what it means to another, B, since in deciding whether what is meant by those words is true A relies on his sensations and B on his, we are still left with the question 'when a person in deciding whether a statement is true or false relies on his sensations do his sensations give him reason to think that statement true or false?' xii-xiii passim I The answer 'yes' seems to imply that the sensations of a person, B, which give him reason for a statement S is P could give to another person, A, as they do to B, reason for that statement, S is P, and thus that any particular person who makes a state- ment S is P, since he has not other people's sensations, lacks unnumerable reasons for that statement which he could have in addition to his own sensations. If we say that this is wrong because in that sense in which the sensations of a person, B, do give anyone else, A, reason to say or think that S is P they could not do so then this seems to imply that the sensations by reference to which a person decides whether ot not S is P do not really give him reason to say or think that S is P or to say or think that it is not P, xiii-xix J But the answer 'no, the sensations on which a person relies in deciding whether a statement as to what is so is true or false do not give him reason to think it true or false' also seems wrong. It seems wrong in view of the affinity and connexion between (a) those differences between one person and another which we mark by saying 'this person has information, testimony, data, which gives him abundant reason (some reason, indirect reason, direct reason) to say or think that S is P; that person has not' and (b) those diff-erences between one person and another which we are at least inclined to mark by saying 'this person has in his sensations, in the testimony of his senses, in his sense-data, abundaint reason (some reason, indirect reason, direct reason) to say or think that S is P; that person has not', xiii-xix K The procedure of re-viewing the contrasts and affinities between cases to which a term con- ventionally is applied (or not applied) and cases to which someone unconventionally refuses to apply it (or insists on applying it) which enables us to extract the truth from the paradoxes of metaphysical philosophy, such as 'no-one really knows how things appear in the mind of another' or 'no-one really has any reason for any statement as to what is so' is also the procedure appropriate to non-metaphysical paradoxes such as 'no-one is really good', no-one is really sane', 'each of us lives alone', xix-xxiv, cf. xii-xiii WOLHEIM, R. A. I Privacy, Vol. LI (195G-51), pp. 83-104 Synopsis: A A philosophical scepticism about the feelings of others to be distinguished from ordinary scepticism, by its generality, 83 B The problem is usually taken to be, 'how can we know a person's feelings on the basis of his benaviour?' Three well-known answers to this problem: the physicalist answer (behaviour -feeling), the inductive answer (behaviour good evidence for feelings), and the 'pointless lament' answer (behaviour the only evidence we ever could have for feelings). All three of these answers unsatisfactorv 84-94 C This suggests a problem incorrectly posed. The next problem is not about in- ference or evidence, but about meaning or significance: not how feeling-statements are establhshed, but how they are signiiicant, 94-5 D Significance of feeling-statements brought out by distinguishing 'public statements' from 'private statements'. Possible misinterpretations of the distinction, 96-8 E Difficulty of supplementing this linguistic distinction by an account of 'what more' can be said in a language that contains private statements and public statements, than in one that contained merely public statements. Analysis of this difliculty, 98-101 F Relation between public statements as such and private statnements as such, a 'philosophical question': relation between particular public statements and particular private statements a 'pragmatic question', 101-3 G Any linguistic solution of this problem leaves one with the feeling that the metaphysical question is still to be answered. Can it be answered? 104 104</page><page sequence="109">WOOZLEY Wolheim, R. A.-continued 2 The difference between sensing and observing, Symposium (with R. J. Hirst), Suppl. XXVIII (1954), pp. 219-40 Synopsis: A Prefatory: the question is to be treated broadly, here, our chief inquiry being into the distinction often made by philosophers between a 'higher' and a 'lower' mode of perception: e.g. seeing indirectly v seeing directly, soft data v hard data, perceiving material objects v having sense-data etc., 219 B 'Linguistic method' valuable in answering this question: Hirst's criticism of it a misunderstanding, 219-23 C Ryle's task-words v achievement-words is less valuable: Hirst's support for this both inconsistent with his attack on linguistic method and inconclusive in itself, 223-5 D Central question (i) how to distinguish between 'material-object' language and 'sensory' language, 225 E Criti- cism of any attempt to characterize an absolute sensory language. Indirect method of doing this (i.e. by reference to material-object language) and direct method (i.e. by reference to what sensory language describes) equally unsuccessful, 225-30 F Sensory language only relative: i.e. it is a language which expresses perceptual claims that we have no means of reducing further, 230-1 G Notion of 'reduction of perceptual claims' analysed. 'Making a more reduced claim' contrasted with (a) correcting a claim, (b) making a claim about part of the original object (cf. Moore on sense-data as surfaces of objects), and (c) making a less emphatic claim, 231-5 H The question considered, whether a reduced claim is entailed by the original claim? Significance of this question for classical sense-datum philosophy. The answer is no. Significance of this answer: the possibility of knowing what one sees without knowing how it looks to one. A verification of this is the history of the visual arts, 235-40 3 Equality, Vol. LVI (1955-56), pp. 281-300 Synopsis: A Two principles of equality exist in European thought. The first might be exemplified by saying (in the sphere of property), every man has right to equal property: the second by saying every man has equal right to property. These two principles differ, and it is the second that is characteristic of European liberalism, 281-2 B But the second of these principles seems to be compatible with every form of inegalitarianism. For any unequal distribution of goods between people can be said to be compatible with equality of rights, so long as there is some other point of difference between the people concerned-for this point of difference can be said to form the basis of the right to the goods in question. The answer, briefly, is that though the point of difference 'may be said to form the basis of the right'. in many cases it may not truly be said to do so. And the principle of equality is not observed unless distribution is effected in accordance with the real rights of man, i.e. the principle is an 'ideal of perfection' not a 'rule of life', 282-7 C What does this principle exclude a priori? Special rights are not based on general rights, 287-90 D In many cases equality deals with rights where the situation is competitive, i.e. where not everyone can have or do that which he has a right to have or do. In such cases what counts; as respecting or not infringing such rights? Problem examined with special regard to every man's right to control legislation, i.e. democratic theory. The problem that arises in such. situations distinguished from the kind of problem that arises in welfare situations; for the: preservation of rights is not equivalent to the maximization of satisfaction. The final answer seems to be that no general criteria can be laid down for non-infringement of rights, 290-300 E Is the principle of equality the basic principle of liberalism? Can every demand for liberty be stated in terms of it? 300 WOOD, 0. P. 1 The force of linguistic rules, Vol. LI (1950-51), pp. 313-28 Synopsis: A The point of the recommendation to talk of rules of use, 313-14 B The words rule and use have various connotations which do not apply in linguistic contexts, 314-17 C (i) Uses (i.e. purposes) of language, (ii) linguistic usages, and (iii) uses as in rules of use, distinguished, 317-25 D Getting one's hearer to understand, is not properly described as the purpose of utterance which the rules enable one to achieve. Comparably, the citing of linguistic examples is not adducing empirical evidence in favour of philosophical theories, 325-8 WOOZLEY, A. D. 1 Knowing and not knowing, Vol. LIII (1952-53), pp. 151-72 Synopsis: A The common supposition that being sure is a necessary condition of knowing is false; a man might know, even although he did not feel sure, 151 B The view that being sure is necessary to knowing may be due to a failure to attend to two distinctions: (iX the distinction between knowing and claiming to know. From the fact that a man would not himself claim to know that p, it does not follow he does not know that p, (ii) the distinction between justifiably claiming to know and truly claiming to know. For my claim-to-know to be justifiable I must be sure, and I need not be right; my claim might be false. For my 105 H</page><page sequence="110">WRIGHT Woozley, A. D.-continued claim-to-know, to be true, I must be right; but I need not be sure, i.e. the claim 'I know that p, although I am not sure that p', although not a justifiable claim, might be true, 151-6 C The suggestion that being sure, while not necessary to knowing-how, is necessary to knowing-that. But the antithesis between knowing-how and knowing-that is far from clear- cut; and much knowing-how involves knowing-that, 156-9 D We need further to distinguish knowing but not being sure, from thinking that one knows. Reasons why, although 'he knows how', 'he thinks he knows how' and 'he knows that' are acceptable ex- pressions, 'he thinks he knows that' seems queer. But there is a situation which 'I think I know that p' (and, consequently, 'he thinks he knows that p') might accurately report, viz. the situation in which I have no doubt of the truth of p, but have some doubt (diffidence, modesty) about my ability to show that p. 161-7i E Conclusion: 'to know' has a much poorer claim to be regarded as a psychological verb than is generally recognised, 171-2 WRIGHT, J. N. 4 Mind and the concept of mind, Suppl. XXXIII (1959), pp. 1-22 Synopsis: A The paper consists of a critical examination of Professor Ryle's The concept of mind and falls into two main parts; first, some comments on method, and secondly detailed examination of some major points in Ryle's thesis, 1-2 B Ryle's professed aim was to show the logic of the propositions in which mind-concepts are used; and in order to do this he propounds the theory that all mind-concepts are to be evinced as public and as bodily. But (i) in a purely logical study, publicity or privacy seem to be irrelevant, (ii) the relation of such a study to psychical fact is unclear, (iii) if there is no privacy, the origin of the con- cept of privacy is inexplicable and the use of the word 'public' otiose, (iv) Professor Ryle's tool and criterion of correctness is English-language usage, but this is confused with the empirical tests by means of which we judge the truth or falsity of propositions, (v) study of the relations between mind-concepts seems to be rendered impossible by the fact, as shown by example, that Ryle seems to be forced into the view that 'each statement contains its own logic'; a view which, in the opinion of the present writer, leads to anarchy, 2-8 C A further criticism concerns the statement that the mind is 'the topic of sets of hypothetical and semi-hypothetical propositions'. This is to blur the distinction between hypothetical sentences and reporting-sentences in the English language; and it provides no clear demarca- tion as to how mind-words are to be distinguished from body-words, 8-9 D Nor does the distinction between hypothetical or dispositional sentences and categorical or reporting sentences avoid the dualism of Descartes; which it was the main purpose of the book to avoid, 9-10 E Examination in detail, of instances where the concept of 'privacy' seems to be correctly and unavoidably used, even in English language usage; in, e.g., 'he concealed his grief', 'he digs with pleasure' and, in general, in statements about feelings. Further, an examination of the concept of 'attention' or 'heed', seems to show the failure of Ryle's attempt to account for it, in detail, by one episodic account which describes public facts with a large number of hypotheticals. It fails precisely because it gives an inadequate account of the purposive side of attention, which seems to demand (i) a concept governing the whole process and (ii) a recognition of instances of concepts; both of which demand privacy. The conclusion indicated-namely, that one act of mind is to conceptualise and another to recognise, 10-18 F The paper ends with a criticism, of Ryle's views on avowals, and some general remarks on why the book seems to fail of its main purpose-eradicating the dualism of mind and matter, 19-22 106</page><page sequence="111">PART II SUBJECTS</page><page sequence="112">The references here given under any Subject are references back, to Part I of this volume.
