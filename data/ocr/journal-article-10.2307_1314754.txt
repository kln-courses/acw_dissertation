<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews The Fictional Father: Lacanian Readings of the Text. Edited by Robert Con Davis. Amherst: The University of Massachusetts Press, I98I. 203 pp. $I5.00. In this collection of six essays on English and American fiction (Dickens, Melville, Joyce, Faulkner and Barthelme), the critics pursue some of the more promising implications of Jacques Lacan's thought for literary studies. Unlike many current anthologies of criticism, therefore, The Fictional Father coheres as a whole since each contributor is drawing from the same set of key Lacanian concepts. The cohesion of the volume is further guaranteed by Robert Con Davis's critical introduction which not only presents the theoretical material in a most cogent and intelligent fashion but proceeds to demonstrate its worth for narrative analysis by sketching out a reading of The Odyssey along the father/son axis. None of the essays to follow can provide quite the same degree of focus on the literary theoretical issues. To close the volume, Davis has also provided an epilogue which attempts to situate Lacanian theory in a broader critical context. If, however, this collection is successful in promoting a new brand of psycho- analytic criticism within the marketplace of American literary studies, it may be because certain concessions have been made to accommodate a somewhat in- sular context-a context in which theory of whatever sort has traditionally been opposed to practical criticism. That the anthology addresses itself to this context is made quite clear in the opening pages of Davis's introduction. And it is here also that questions may arise about the project as conceived by the editor. In this prologue, psychoanalytic criticism in the American academy is loosely compared to a child passing through several phases into maturity. In its latest Lacanian phase, Davis sees a new configuration taking the place of an older one which dies "because of an inability to go beyond thematic content and to con- front literary structure" (p. I). In other words, a new Oedipal theory has re- placed the old Oedipal theory because it is "better," by which one understands: it takes account of a larger reality, in this case, literary structure. Just as, in Freud's account, the phallic phase (during which Oedipal conflict sets in) con- ceives only binary oppositions of power hierarchies-aggressive weapons and passive holes -and thus must give way when confronted with evidence of geni- tal difference, so too one theory must replace another when a larger reality needs to be accounted for. By this analogy (if that is indeed what it is), theories break down and need to be replaced when something like sexual difference- which is not a binary opposition but a third term-intervenes. By this account, Lacanian theory has replaced an earlier allegorical or thematic form of psycho- analytic criticism because that theory is genital, rather than phallic: a third term, the symbol, shifts the dualism of allegory. This third term operates as Book Reviews 71</page><page sequence="2">language, or the symbolic, in Lacan, the realm of castrated meanings, meaning, that is, castration. Briefly then, this anthology means to give account of a larger reality and therefore to sustain a better theory of that reality. If indeed this is one aim of the anthology, then one would expect to find the third term, language or signification, much in evidence here. And so it is. Yet, just as Freud's earlier American interpreters fell easily into an allegorization of his concepts, several of these readers of Lacan have done something similar and allegorized a Lacanian notion of language. What is too often missing here is a sense of the rhetorical shiftiness of the Ecrits. The same neglect of the rhetorical dimension beyond allegorical dualism (signifier/signified, son/father) also af- fects the literary interpretations, although to a lesser degree. The most remark- able exception is Regis Durand's essay "'The Captive King': The Absent Father in Melville's Text." Jean-Michel Rabate's essay on Joyce offers as well a keen sense of metaphorical transformation. Psychological, thematic allegory, however, haunts the rest of this volume despite the repeated reminders that the term "father" refers not to a psychological entity but to a function in language that is subject to shift and transformation. The theme of the father still recurs. In part, this may happen because of the status given Lacan here. As the conceptual father named in the title, he is, ac- cording to the anthropomorphic, familial allegory of Davis's introduction, "a direct descendant from the parent's origin" (p. 2). From such a beginning, it is easy to see how thefunction of the symbolic might be allegorized into a figure like the father, the figure of the law in the lawgiver. In addition, no serious attention is here accorded to the cautions other theorists have exercised when considering key Lacanian notions such as the signification of the phallus and the binding of desire to the law. (Davis's account in his epilogue of the critical reaction to Lacan is very unsatisfactory in this regard.) But there is a risk, it would seem, in overlooking the ways in which Lacanian conceptuality may be- come implicated in a certain institutionalization of power. Notions such as The-Name-of-the-Father can be made to fit comfortably into, for example, the institution of literary studies in America. Once that institution has been char- acterized in the allegorical terms of Davis's introduction-as successive genera- tions of fathers and sons-is it really any wonder that Lacan's "symbolic father" might appear to be "the ideal subject of the new criticism" (p. 2)? Does not the question arise as to whether this subject appears "ideal" precisely because it seems to fit a phallocentric myth, or allegory, of intellectual generation? To be sure, it would be unfair to judge this anthology solely on the basis of the allegorical cast of its opening pages. The point of the allegory is to bring us to gauge "the maturity of the new Freudian criticism . . . according to its use- fulness as practical criticism-as interpretation" (p. 2). And from this utilitarian point of view, these essays are generally very good, even at times brilliant, exer- cises in interpretation. Perhaps one should accept Davis's criterion of useful in- 72 Book Reviews</page><page sequence="3">terpretation and not bother with the question: for whom or for what is an interpretation useful? To do so, however, may be to leave aside the most radical potential of psychoanalytic theory for the practice of literature. I refer to the very different status assumed by "interpretation" once the mechanisms of the unconscious have been put in relation to the structures of signification. As Sho- shana Felman has demonstrated in her essay on the interpretive aporia of "The Turn of the Screw" ["Turning the Screw of Interpretation," Yale French Studies 55/56], psychoanalytic criticism in America will not have progressed much be- yond Edmund Wilson's reductive allegories until it gives up the notion of its adequacy as interpretation-as practical criticism-and admits the generative movement of the third, symbolic term to enter its discussion of the text. It is certain that all the contributors to The Fictional Father know this as well. The difficulty, as always, comes in the performance of that knowledge.

Brian McCrea's Henry Fielding and the Politics of Mid-Eighteenth-Century Eng- land, winner of the I979 SAMLA award, is a noteworthy book. His title sug- gests that this is an attempt to do for Fielding studies what Donald Greene's The Politics of SamuelJohnson (Yale, I960) did for Johnson studies-a formidable ambition. Given his topic, we expect such a book to perform three major tasks: first, paint an accurate picture of the politics that prevailed in England during the later part of the Age of Walpole; second, pinpoint Henry Fielding's politics within that larger scheme while evaluating their meaning; third, demonstrate that a proper understanding of the relationship between the two throws signifi- cant light on Fielding's achievements as a literary figure. It seems to me that Brian McCrea succeeds reasonably well on the first two counts, but not so well on the third. On the first count McCrea argues that the War of Spanish Succession (1702- I7I3) was the crucial event in determining political alignments in the early and middle decades of the eighteenth century. This has more bite than one might suppose, since it is usually assumed that the Hanoverian succession in I7I4 per- formed this function. Yet McCrea is not concerned with the implications of a Lutheran, German-speaking monarch as head of church and state in England. Attitudes toward the war, not the monarch, were the key factor, particularly as these attitudes expressed the different notions of property promoted by "am- biguities" in the political writings of John Locke.
