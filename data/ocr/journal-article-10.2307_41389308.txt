Griffith and the Origins of American Narrative Film: The Early Years at Biograph Tom Gunning Urbana: Illinois UP, 1991. 328 pp. Babel and Babylon: Spectatorship in American Silent Film Miriam Hansen Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1991. 377 pp. Jane Gaines These two new histories give us an American silent era we wouldn't recognize from the earlier histories of Benjamin Hampton, Terry Ramsaye, Jean Mitry, Georges Sadoul, and Lewis Jacobs. While they are not the first of the histories written post-1 970s film theory and coincident with a shift to reception studies, they innovatively bridge the great divides in contemporary film scholarship - between theory and history as well as between industry study and textual analysis. In answer to the question of the historically specific specta- tor, Hansen demarcates what she terms a "reconstruction" of the "horizon of reception," and this turns out to be an entirely original combination of empirical detail, textual analysis, and critical theory. Hansen's Babel and Babylon is the most magnificently laid out attempt in English to illustrate the analytic viability of the theory of the public sphere that comes to us primarily from two German studies: Jürgen Habermas's The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (1962) and Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge's The Public Sphere and Experi- ence (1972). The conception of the public sphere has become extremely relevant for cultural studies, especially where it offers theoretical features that could help rectify theoretical problems with the cinema spectator. For in their notion of the public sphere as an "intersubjective space," Negt and Kluge theorize individual percep- tions intersected by social dimensions, and, in addition, a space subject to unpredictable developments. Significantly, the public</page><page sequence="2">184 Discourse 16.1 sphere as a social but not necessarily a class formation is a subtle correction of traditional Marxist theory, yet it still retains some key features, notably, hope in the collectivity and the possibility of social change. Cinema in its early period, says Hansen, was an emerging public sphere, but not, as yet, a thoroughly bourgeois (and male) sphere. For a limited time, she says, it could be seen as an alternative public sphere, a public viewing space that accommodated women. Turning the dismissive mockery of the cult of Rudolph Valentino on its head, Hansen, in the dramatic climax of the book, shows how Valentino represented such a space for women, presenting us with a version of female sexuality that contradicts the nineteenth-century cult of domesticity. Taken together, these books by Hansen and Gunning offer something perhaps even more important for Marxist cultural the- ory: they supply new evidence for seeing the emergence of classical narrative cinema as one of those rare cases in which the appearance of an aesthetic form has a relatively direct link with class restructura- tion and economic change (like the coincidence of the rise of the middle class and the appearance of the novel in seventeenth-century Europe). It is not only that 1909 marks the beginning of the stan- dardization of motion picture form following the organization of the monopolistic Motion Picture Patents Company in December 1908. Many more social, economic, and aesthetic developments converged than we had previously thought. Both Gunning and Hansen build on recent scholarship that associates this period with the move from broad to "intimate" acting styles, the psychologically motivated character, and the association of closure with the enclosure of family life. Noting that the term "spectator" was first used by newspaper critic (and later D.W. Griffith collaborator) Frank Woods in 1910, Hansen documents the "invention" of spectatorship, arguing that it was an ingenious answer to the "instability of consumerism," that impossible situation in which the worker was placed, faced as he was with the necessity of converting his labor to purchasing power. Further, she demonstrates that the classical spectator was an industry solution to the problem of an ethnically and sexually "mixed" audience. Not only did the production of narrative commodities facilitate the standardization of exhibition and distribution, but it "eliminated" the "conditions around which local, ethnic, class, and gender-related experience might crystallize" (44) . In a discussion of the ghetto film, Hansen shows how the films and the neighborhood theater cultures were at odds with "American" values. Even more intriguing, she proposes that we look for the signs of alternative spectatorship in the classical narrative text whose very streamlining is evidence of a historical "negation" of this unruly audience. We are to find this pre-classical spectator inside the text but also outside of it, especially in the way this audience was hushed up (by the</page><page sequence="3">Fall 1993 185 enforcement of silence) during the move from a cinema of attraction to a cinema of "absorption." In other words, the form of classical narrative cinema itself gives testimony to the threat to bourgeois order of the disorderly class and gender "othered" audience. In D.W. Griffith and the Origins of American Narrative Film, Tom Gunning goes further than any scholar to date in locating the shift from the pre-1906 "primitive" cinema - through the transitional stage he calls the cinema of "narrative integration" - to the 1909 "narrator system." Significantly, his contribution to filling out this crucial convergence of economics and aesthetics is to read that convergence in D.W. Griffith's 1908-09 Biograph melodramas, meticulously analyzed here. Among the rewards of this book are new analyses of the canonical Griffith shorts, highlighted with discussions of the "forgotten" transitional films, so that, for instance, less well- known 1909 films such as The Guerilla, The Drive far Life , and The Mediane Bottle become background for understanding the signifi- cance of cross-cutting in The Lonely Villa (1909). Also from 1909, A Drunkard's Reform and The Mended Lute emerge as missing examples of Griffith's work, among so many others that one wonders how earlier scholars could have theorized this key Griffith period from so few of the 450 Biograph titles attributable to the director. From this depth of research, Gunning makes observations that challenge the historical record on Griffith at every turn. The mythology about the first uses of the closeup, the pan, and the parallel editing structure should dissolve against this new account that draws on the theoretical work of Gérard Genette, Emile Benveniste, and Peter Brooks, among others, to explain the stuttering emergence of a new discourse. Gunning's argument is basically this: that over a relatively short timespan early cinema evolved from a cinema of showing to a cinema of telling, the former ending around 1906-07 and the latter emerg- ing in the Biograph 1908-09 period, the years in question in this study. As Gunning argues, during this time, the external narrator - originally part of the unrjily exhibition context - becomes "integrated" into the film. At a mid-stage, however, this "primitive" narration may be visible, helping to display the devices and even addressing the audience directly. But in the "narrator system" (an "extreme form" of the cinema of "narrative integration"), the cinematic discourse is structured by an invisible hand. The reader new to film history and theory will have questions about the term "narrator system," crucial here since so much of Gunning's argument depends on understanding how it might work. As I see it, Gunning is trying with the term to juggle a number of difficult and contradictory developments: to retain Griffith's moral viewpoint (without attributing authorial intention), to borrow the connotations of narrative rule-boundedness from semiotic theory,</page><page sequence="4">186 Discourse 16.1 to suggest the industrialization of the creative process, and even to emphasize the "force" involved in narrative (although not, as yet, the coercion) . This new formulation and period breakdown will not go uncontested. (Already Gunning's anthropomorphic term "narrator" is at odds with David Bordwell and Edward Branigan's theorization of the cinematic discourse at this stage.) In defense of the concept of "narrator system," Gunning argues that it preserves the spectator's sense of "being told a story." Parallel editing, as he says, "ruled the narrator system" (189), which was most fully devel- oped in films like the 1909 Corner in Wheat , a film generally under- stood only as an example of "contrast editing" but also considered by Gunning as the "editorial," a term he borrows from a 1909 review of the adaptation of Frank Norris's "A Deal in Wheat." The question of narrative form opens out directly onto the class composition of early audiences, a controversial point among the new historiographers, and not surprisingly the differences among them can be charted along the question of whether or not pre-1906 cinema is understood as narrative cinema. Although Hansen stresses "class" somewhat more than Gunning, the two can be located closer to Noël Burch (who has argued for the radical "otherness" of pre-1906 cinema), and somewhat further from David Bordwell, Kristin Thompson, andjanet Staiger, who have argued that narrative is incipient from the beginning of cinema history. The questions of form and social class come to a head at the key 1909 moment I have described, where it is an issue of whether the audience up to this time was predominantly working-class or middle-class. Did the indus- try expand its appeal to working-class or to middle-class patrons in 1909? As Staiger has recently argued in Interpreting Films (1992), although middle-class viewers may not have attended the five-cent nickelodeons, they would have seen films in the twenty-five-cent vaudeville houses - that is, the audience was already middle-class in 1909. Gunning argues that in 1909 the industry was thinking about both audiences, realizing that they had a working-class audience at about the same time that they were attempting to reach a new middle-class audience. In the absence of convincing statistics one way or another, what comes across in both Gunning and Hansen is the association between film and "low morals," documented by the attempts to censor film and close down theaters. Hansen tells us that reform campaigns removed such exhibition excesses as the carnival- esque on-stage lecturer and the "sing-along," and that a "proper" lecturer was then brought back in 1908-09 in an attempt to clean up the theaters by means of cultural "uplift." As she quotes D.W. Griffith, in these years there was a need "to kill the slum tradition in the movies" (64). What is at stake? For one thing, the relation between film form and bourgeois ideology and the consequent construction of a clas-</page><page sequence="5">Fall 1993 187 sical spectator. While film theorists wouldn't necessarily want to argue for any "class belongingness" of either pre-1906 or post-1909 cinema, where are we if we argue that cinema, from its inception, is thoroughly bourgeois (and embryonically narrative)? To see early cinema as not bourgeois always seems to sound like an investment in the position of the "thorough saturation" (of bourgeois cinema). It may be something else. As Hansen subtly puts it, the histories we have had until now have tended to give us a conception of the institution that tends to "side with the victor" (the industry) . This would suggest that the difference between seeing pre-1906 cinema as radically non-narrative as opposed to seeing it as not significantly different from what it would become, is a matter of which "side" a scholar takes. In less polarized terms, it could be said that until recently we have had a legacy of "top down" histories of the motion picture industries in Britain, France, and Germany, as well as in the US. Hopefully, taken together with new studies of fandom, Babel and Babylon represents a turn toward "bottom up" film histories in the tradition of E.P. Thompson's history of the British working class. But to come back to the question of what is at stake, we have to look outside film studies to debates in Western Marxism. For it seems that we are reminded that film and television studies is still a subfield, and what will matter ultimately may be the impact of Negt and Kluge's reformulation of a "proletarian" public sphere into the notion of "public life." What we may also be witnessing is a soft-pedaling of "proletarian" as a critical term and an emerging preference for the more all-encompassing concept of "oppositionality." This move relieves the burden of arguing the existence of a class formation (or forgives the error of assuming it without proving its existence) , and may be attractive to scholars studying US working-class culture which, it seems, is always on the verge of becoming bourgeois. Hansen's formulation has the beauty of offering an alternative public sphere that is not yet taken over; if we were to deny its existence, we would certainly close it down as a space for studying Utopian aspirations and counter-hegemonies. Leaving it open seems a perfectly reasonable proposition that would appeal even to the strictest empiricist since we still know too little about the sociology of the US audience during the early period of cinema. But, having said this, I would still want to argue that oppositionality without "class" is problematic because of the way it promiscuously invites too much under its umbrella. The "primitive" even becomes aligned with the avant-garde, as in Gunning's influential 1986 article "The Cinema of Attractions: Early Film, Its Spectator and the Avant-Garde" published in Wide Angle . It is not that I am unsympathetic with independent filmmakers' identification with the pioneers (or critical comparisons</page><page sequence="6">188 Discourse 16.1 drawn between early cinema and avant-garde styles for that matter) . It is that even as this move helps to situate early cinema as "counter" to mainstream narrative, the strange alliance (a "Coney Island of the avant-garde") produces a "forgetting," for as the "primitive" is taken over by the avant-garde, it moves from low to high art. Gunning's study of Griffith in the book gives us "Coney Island" without the avant-garde. And this is exceedingly important, for I think that the case for the alignment of the working class with early cinema depends on seeing it on a continuum with P.T. Barnum's American Museum, Barnum and Bailey's Circus, and Hale's Tours. Having once undertaken a study of ballyhoo in the early years as its practitioners moved from the circus to the new moving pictures, I am convinced that we have not done enough to emphasize the low culture roots of the motion picture ("From Elephants to LUX Soap: Early Motion Picture Exploitation," The Velvet Light Trap , 1990). Both of these histories depend on our acceptance of pre-1906 cinema as a "cinema of attractions," a concept Gunning and early cinema historian André Gaudreault have taken from Eisenstein 's idea of cinema as associated with fairground attractions in general and the roller coaster in particular - with an impact that is both physiological and psychological. Crucial here is the understanding of early cinema as an "exhibitionist" cinema, a diversion that empha- sizes visual sensation, emotional titillation, and showing over telling. What this notion displaces is an earlier view of the motion picture as heir to the traditions of legitimate theater, Gunning reminds us, at the same time that both he and Hansen argue for seeing early cinema as much closer to live performance than have earlier historians. Provocative as the concept of "exhibitionist" cinema is, for most film scholars, the "cinema of attractions" remains a hypothesis they have to take on faith, relying as they must on the word of those few historians of early cinema who have had the fortune to attend, for example, the Pordenone Silent Film Festival in Italy. Of the key texts in the basic discussions of "exhibitionism," only The Gay Shoe Clerk (E.S. Porter, 1903) is part of the film history canon. It is unfortunate that the success or failure of this concept of exhibitionist cinema should have to wait on the availability of video- tapes from the Before Hollywood exhibition, now distributed as a 16mm package from the American Foundation of the Arts. Consider the new theoretical areas that could be opened up by the proposition that early cinema is "exhibitionistic." Do we, for instance, want to see "exhibitionism" as the antithesis of "voyeurism"? Is Judith Mayne in The Woman at the Keyhole (1990) right that early cinema is not without its invitations to voyeurism? Does early cinema open up a different space for women in its use of female "primitive" narra- tors?</page><page sequence="7">Fall 1993 189 Finally, emerging from these new histories is a revised version of D.W. Griffith. As many have long suspected, he was not completely committed to the classical aesthetic - and Gunning doesn't dodge the fact that neither cross-cutting nor cutting-on action actually served the ends of continuity. In the most thorough and sophisti- cated overview of parallel editing to date, Gunning locates this technique somewhere between the visceral "cinema of attractions" and the smooth classical narrative style that finally subsumed it. The test case, as Hansen demonstrates, becomes Intolerance (1916), a throwback to the "cinema of attractions," the darling of the avant- garde, and an allegory for the American economic dominance over foreign markets in the motion picture industry. In a tour de force reading, Hansen presents the contradictions that constitute the figure of Griffith, condensing them around his vision of the Univer- sal Language of film, curiously both a Utopian ideal of classlessness, accessibility, and global brotherhood tied at once to its opposite - his own reactionary defense of nationalism and the ideology of white supremacy that drove The Birth of a Nation . In her final analysis, spectacle wins over narrative.</page></plain_text>
