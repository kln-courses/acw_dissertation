Coetzee GuestEditor Introduction to "Cruelty, Suffering, Imagination: The Lessons of J. M. Coetzee" ABSTRACT For over two decades, Nobel laureate J. M. Coetzee has brilliantly addressed issues of interest to anthropologists: the brutal effects of racist tyranny and injustice in South Africa; the reach of empire; guilt and revenge; and the problem of language in particular historical and political moments. In his recent work Elizabeth Costello (2003a), Coetzee confronts a particularly pressing set of contemporary political and ethical concerns, ones to which anthropologists have much to add. In this "In Focus," anthropologists from each of the subdisciplines use Elizabeth Costello as a lens for working through such concerns, addressing a range of questions?including the nature of evil and its relationship to state power, the burden of belief, the legacy of colonialism, the ethical limits of representations of horror, what it means to live in a world of cruelty and suffering, and the power of humans' sympathetic imagination to confront such a world. [Keywords: cruelty, suffering, imagination, ethics] SURPRISE was the reaction at Princeton's 1997-98 "Tan- ner Lectures on Human Values" (Attridge 2005:193) when instead of the expected pronouncement of his views in lecture form, the South African novelist J. M. Coetzee offered a fiction about an aging Australian female novelist, Elizabeth Costello, herself giving a lecture, "The Philoso? phers and the Animals." That paper, paired with 'The Poets and the Animals/' the second of his Tanner lectures also presented as delivered by Costello, was later integrated into his novel Elizabeth Costello (Coetzee 2003a), with additional chapters constructed as lectures given largely by this fic- tional novelist and brief vignettes of the various occasions on which they were delivered. Like Coetzee's own presentations at Princeton, Costello's lectures often discomfit her audience by breaking with expected academic norms and provoke awkward, emotional exchanges. Each chapter describing such an occasion in Elizabeth Costello (Coetzee 2003a) is called a "lesson," and deals with deeply philosophical and political issues?whether cruelty to animals, evil and the ethics of representing the suffering that humans inflict on each other and other creatures, the problem of the novel and the humanities in postcolonial Africa, imagination, desire, or mortality. Complex ruminations are rendered as uncomfortable exchanges between Costello and members of her fictional audience, both scholars and her family members, who are variously outraged and embarrassed by what can sometimes seem too deeply felt, too incoherently expressed, senile rants. It is not clear how readers, as yet another audience, should respond to these chapters. Jayne Poyner has suggested that they are best understood as Co- etzee's way of poking fun "at critics who have charged him with literary elitism" (2003). But is this all? Can we simply dismiss Coetzee's instructions as clever one-upsmanship? Although the book is playful and self-mocking, reflecting Coetzee's own discomfort with the punditry expected of a distinguished novelist and with himself in that role, they also raise issues of deep concern evident in his earlier work. For over two decades now, Coetzee has brilliantly taken up questions that have also been at the center of the con? temporary anthropological agenda. He has explored the reach of empire and its construction of the barbarian Other (Waiting for the Barbarians, 1980); who is empowered to speak and the shaping of the historical record (Foe, 1996); existence in the rlesh and its relationship to belief (The Mas- ter of Petersburg, 1995); mortality, fleshly vulnerability, and politics (Age oflron, 1998); and collective guilt and revenge (Disgrace, 2000). Both his critical, autobiographical writing (Boyhood, 1997; Youth, 2003b) and his fiction return repeat- edly to issues of language in particular historical and po? litical moments as well as in literary works (Doubling the Point, 1992; Stranger Shores, 2002; White Writing, 1990). Co? etzee has raised metaphysical and ethical concerns?about cruelty and suffering, the nature of evil, and the burden American Anthropologist, Vol. 108, Issue 1, pp. 84-87, ISSN 0002-7294, electronic ISSN 1548-1433. ? 2006 by the American Anthropological Association.

Introduction: Cruelty, Suffering, Imagination 85 of belief, for example. He often accomplishes this through interrogating persistent conceptual boundaries, ones that anthropologists have long engaged?notably between the human and the animal, the mortal and the supernatural, the philosophical and the anthropological, the material and the ideal, the aesthetic and the ethical. Although anthropologists have grappled with the boundaries Coetzee troubles, and taken up a number of sim- ilar issues, too often we have backed away from the larger metaphysical framework within which Coetzee poses his questions about them. We have instead engaged with the particularities of specific ethnographic contexts?the hall- mark of the discipline?which have, indeed, sensitized us to the dangers of generalizations about "the human con? dition." But is this our only option? Here is where we find Coetzee instructive. Some critics have responded with anger and derision to Elizabeth Costello (2003a), claiming it is not a novel but an antinovel. They read the novel as Coetzee hiding be- hind the masquerade of Costello and presenting his philo? sophical views in the guise of storytelling. Complicating the situation is the fact that Coetzee himself has delivered not only the two chapters as Tanner lectures but also at least two other chapters as lectures in other venues and on other occa- sions; on each of these occasions, he quoted long excerpts of his own fictional character giving a lecture. Coetzee may dis- concert readers expecting realist fiction, but from the point of view of anthropology, this technique provides a way to have it both ways: In speaking through a character, he seems to insist that ideas, intellect, and ethical principles can only be understood in the context of particular earthly bodies. He is intent on discovering the particulars that trouble abstract pronouncements while still placing those pronouncements dead center. Thus, like anthropologists, Coetzee seems to be right- fully wary of metaphysical questions and concerns ab- stracted from life on the ground. As Coetzee reinforces, dominant discourses of values have tended to focus on tran- scendent human values, a notion many anthropologists have analyzed as a truth claim that often buttresses systems of oppression. But as Coetzee's work shows, it is precisely our sustained engagement in the lives of Others all over the world that provides us with a powerful vantage point for re- framing the ethical and moral deliberations about human values, suffering, and responsibility. Using Coetzee as guide, then, what we are looking for is a "grounded metaphysics," a taking on of some of today's most pressing issues, which are just as critical to us today as they were for Plato and Kant, Kafka and Joyce?all inter- locutors who inform Coetzee's inquires in Elizabeth Costello (2003a)?if in somewhat revised form. As a step in this en- deavor, we asked colleagues from each of the subdisciplines to participate in a consideration of some of the central ques? tions addressed by Coetzee in Elizabeth Costello (2003a). It is testimony to the provocative and enigmatic challenge of this book that the anthropologists we invited readily and enthusiastically agreed to take on the kind of book not typically addressed by anthropologists, as had such distin- guished scholars as cultural critic Marjorie Garber; bioethi- cist Peter Singer; historian of religions Wendy Doniger; and primatologist Barbara Smuts (1999), all of whom responded to Coetzee's Tanner Lectures. These responses were collected in The Lives of Animals. Our charge to our colleagues was to work through the implications of some of the following questions for anthro? pology as a discipline and for anthropological practices in their subfield: ? how do we live in a world of immense suffering? ? what are the nature and extent of human rights and du? ties toward the other creatures with whom we share the earth? ? what is the nature, value, and ethics of the human ca- pacity for sympathetic imagination? ? at what cost do we elevate "reason" to the place of ulti- mate human value? ? what does it mean to elevate "embodiment" in its place? ? what, if any, are the ethical limits of representations of cruelty and horror? and ? what are the limitations and possibilities of humanism and science in confronting such issues? The four articles in this "In Focus" represent anthropolo? gists entering into dialogue with Coetzee, offering their ob- servations and data to enrich or problematize what they understand him to be saying. Meanwhile, in his after- word, Richard Handler places this "In Focus" collection within the discipline's tradition of "blurring genres" and assesses it within the context of our responsibility as public intellectuals. Archaeologists Lynn Meskell and Lindsay Weiss bring their knowledge of the history of colonialism in South Africa, starting from the Dutch colonization of the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, to a defense of Coetzee. They par- ticularly take up the example of his early novel Waiting for the Barbarians (1980) and respond to critics who fault him for irresponsible ahistorical lack of specificity and a seeming unwillingness to engage directly the particular politics of apartheid. Drawing on his criticism in White Writing (1990), they make the case that his refusal of speci? ficity is strategic: His target is not one moment or out- come but the colonial project itself and the patterns of thought and interaction it engenders. The situation he de? scribes in a novel like Waiting for the Barbarians (1980), they argue, mimics and makes visible the working of col- onizing itself: "The work of the colonial facade, particu- larly as it comes to be reproduced globally, produces a sort of materially situated authority that is neither here nor there, and one that concomitantly enacts a certain suspen- sion of local history and authority" (Meskell and Weiss, this issue). Their project as archeologists is, in part, to dis- cover in the physical record those traces of histories that have been erased. Although writing about the human con- dition generally, they claim, Coetzee also delineates the history and lasting legacy of colonialism: He promotes</page><page sequence="3">86 American Anthropologist ? Vol. 108# No. 1 ? March 2006 reflection "on the inescapably prosaic and personal register in which colonial rule comes to have meaning for individu? als" (Meskell and Weiss, this issue). Coetzee, thus, provides a model for an ethics we need not fear for its universalizing elision of difference. Whereas their article is particularly helpful in see- ing the broad agenda behind much of Coetzee's work, Karin Andriolo opens her article with an insightful read- ing of a particularly enigmatic moment in his work: the postscript to Elizabeth Costello (2003a). There, Coetzee con- structs a letter addressed to Francis Bacon, "the champion of the scientific revolution and a precursor to the Enlight- enment project," purporting to be written by a woman who was his contemporary, Lady Chandos. Andriolo per- ceptively explains the interplay between rational thought and imagining dramatized in this postscript. Lady Chan- dos's letter describes her husband's "distress of mind"?his affliction and the suffering it has caused both her and her husband. She pleads with Bacon to save her husband for he has become so enraptured with identification with inani- mate creatures, so overwhelmed with his communion with everything that exists, and so taken by his own convic- tion that everything his "confused thinking touches on, means something" (2003a:226) that words no longer reach him. Coetzee creates this poignant and heartfelt appeal to reason from emotion, love, and "femininity" as a potential savior from an excess of sympathetic understanding. Sig- nificantly, Lord Chandos himself is the fictional creation of the modernist writer, Hugo von Hofmannsthal. If the Enlightenment is the moment when reason and emotion are solidified as discrete binary oppositions, in the mod? ern period, such oppositions were interrogated. As Andri? olo understands it, "Although Hofmannsthal's spokesman seems a happy man (at least in the tortured way of the cre- ative writer), Coetzee has Lady Chados show us ... the de- sire for pure imagining ... has driven her husband too far. ... Rational thought is a human limitation that estranges us from the natural world, but we need some of it for our social existence, for communicating among each other" (Andriolo, this issue). In a book that makes a case for em- bodiment and sympathetic imagination, Coetzee ends with his own sympathetic imagining of the emotional costs of sympathetic imagining. It is no wonder sociocultural anthropologist Andriolo focuses on this initially off-putting passage of a wife's lov- ing concern toward her husband, because her article makes a case for the attentiveness we owe to those who give them? selves up to a cause: protest suicides. More broadly, she recognizes the relationship between rational thought and imagining at the heart of Elizabeth Costello (2003a). Further- more, Andriolo uses it to explain that although imagining promises the benefit of destabilizing rationality, it also has destructive potential. As Costello argues in one of her lec? tures, a description of certain horrific acts is itself obscene, forcing readers into a physical understanding of extreme cruelty. Costello believes that sympathetic identification is a human ethical responsibility but one that can be abused. Andriolo concludes that protest suicides do have a claim on our attention, even as they impose a recognition of injustice and horror on us. Linguistic anthropologist Steven Caton takes up di- rectly this question of the danger of the depiction of cru? elty. He focuses on Coetzee's chapter on "The Problem of Evil," in which Elizabeth Costello deplores the novelistic presentation of horrific scenes?particularly the portrayal by the actual novelist Paul West of the hanging of the men who intended to assassinate Hitler?fearing that the de? scription of such graphic violence can imperil both writer and reader. As Caton's reading suggests, Costello seems to worry that "evil can become incarnate in texts," leading him to ask if writers might have the artifice and skill to van- quish the evil from their texts. What, he wonders, might such an "aesthetic wherewithal look like?" (Caton, this issue). Caton notes that although a concern with evil and its relationship to state power has been central to some of Co? etzee's other works, most notably Disgrace (2000), it seems curiously absent from Elizabeth Costello (2003a). Caton as- serts this connection, arguing that although power may not be inherently evil, when evil succeeds, "it is because sovereignty has allowed ... or... required it" (Caton, this is? sue). Informed by the theory of Giorgio Agamben, Caton in- terrogates "the problem of evil in the heart of sovereignty," focusing on the connection among three sets of repre- sentations that reached the public in 2004, all of which Costello would no doubt find horrific: (1) Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, (2) the photographs of prisoner tor? ture in Abu Ghraib, and (3) the beheadings of U.S. citi- zens and others by Iraqi insurgent groups. For Caton, these images represent connected evidence of the current po? litical reality in which the structure of power is so con- tested that violence becomes the law, the exception be? comes the rule, and bodies are destroyed without sacrificial meaning. Primatologist Agustin Fuentes would argue that sacri? ficial meaning?indeed, any meaning?is something hu- mans impose on bodies and bears no relationship to bi- ology. Like Andriolo, Fuentes is centrally interested in sympathetic imagination as a concept, one he sees as re- quiring suspicious scrutiny. Fuentes is not only in dialogue with Coetzee on this point but also with fellow primatol? ogist, Barbara Smuts: Fuentes problematizes Smuts's con- ceptualization of "animal personhood" in her published re? sponse to Coetzee's Tanner Lectures (The Lives of Animals, 1999). Barbara Smuts was invited interlocutor because Co? etzee's Tanner Lectures deal with cruelty to animals and an? imal rights. Using her years living among baboons in her response, she argues for understanding animals, whether baboon or dog, not only as individuals but also as individ? ual persons. Smuts, like Coetzee, calls on the human capac- ity for "sympathetic identification"?our ability to "think ourselves into the being of another"?as a means for cross- species communication, treating animals as equals. In so</page><page sequence="4">Mascia-Lees and Sharpe ? Introduction: Cruelty, Suffering, Imagination 87 doing, Smuts aligns herself with humanism, claiming that although science provides invaluable insights into the lives of animals, it also has severe limitations, disallowing the kind of interaction with animals that might end cruelty to? ward them. Fuentes, by contrast, interrogates the limitations of hu? manism, writing back to both Coetzee and Smuts from the perspective of a biological anthropologist. He sees the ca- pacity for sympathetic imagination to be uniquely human. We have the capacity to place an anthropomorphic inter- pretation on any organism, he argues, to use symbolic and metaphoric discourse to translate the experience of another creature into our terms; however, Fuentes sees this activity as suspect. It creates an imagined, rather than a real, sim- ilarity. Much of his article is devoted to discussing what the basis is for what he sees as the actual commonalities between humans and other animals, and to the question of whether cruelty to other species is an innately human characteristic. We believe that these four responses from the four fields of anthropology rise to the challenge that Eliza? beth Costello seems to throw down. These four different approaches?each grounded in evidence from the field, whether archeological artifacts in Africa; different polit? ical and cultural situations in which people decide to sacrifice their life to make a point; contemporary pop- ular culture; or comparative studies of animal behav- ior and the evolutionary record?confront the larger is? sue of human existence: What does it mean to be fleshed beings capable of suffering and cruelty and of imagination?
