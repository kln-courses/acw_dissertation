In the study of politics and aesthetics, which in its modern form alone has been with us at least since Kant and Schiller, nothing appears to have been determined with any certainty, not even it seems, the apparently straight forward, quantifiable matter of whether or not the topic is being much dis cussed. The Politics of Aesthetics, a recently translated text by Jacques Ranciere (2006), contains the following supportive blurb written by the philosopher J. M. Bernstein: "Locating the political significance of art has not only gone out of fashion, it has in recent years become a source of em barrassment. No one has argued against this repression with more preci sion, nuance, and undeniable force than Jacques Ranciere." Locating the politics of art is "out of fashion ... a source of embarrassment," subject even to a "repression"?really? Certainly one hears of attempts to return to supposedly traditional, humanistic concerns with aesthetics that might tran scend politics. But on the whole, as Marc Redfield has commented in his identically titled The Politics of Aesthetics of a few years ago (2003), the criti cism of the last several decades in literary and cultural studies at least has provided a great deal of the sort of "hermeneutics of suspicion" whereby the supposedly disinterested characteristic of the aesthetic is seen to be de termined by some sort of underlying political agenda (2?3). In Labors of Imagination: Aesthetics and Political Economy from Kant to Althusser, Jan Mieszkowski does not comment upon this seemingly odd ambiguity with respect to whether or not a discourse on politics and aesthetics is even hap pening. One senses, however, that should he stumble across a remark like Bernstein's he would deeply appreciate the fundamental indeterminacy it SiR, 49 (Spring 2010)</page><page sequence="2">182 BOOK REVIEWS elicits?are we talking about this or aren't we??and that it would fit well with the overall views argued for in his compelling and important study. Like Redfield, Mieszkowski works from the assumption that delinea tions of the politics of the aesthetic have been pervasive and influential given the predominantly historicist and sociological turn of the criticism of the last quarter century and more. Of particular importance to Mieszkow ski is a growing body of work that has argued for the interrelations of eco nomics and the aesthetic as "discourses" that arise concurrently in the eigh teenth century and which have been argued to play complementary roles in the construction of the bourgeois subject and in the reproduction of the regimes of power which have underwritten such a being. Against the confident determinations of the politics of the aesthetic in contemporary criticism, Mieszkowski brings a detailed and sharply focused deconstructive eye to demonstrate that "all that is solid melts into air"?although in all likelihood even Marx's famous statement would, for Mieszkowski, need to be closely questioned for its too confident concatenation of events and for the certainty it seems to imply about just what, in the first place, is solid and what is air. I don't believe the overplayed and often misapplied term "deconstruc tion" ever appears in Labors of Imagination and Mieszkowski likewise avoids, or displaces, some of the other more recognizable terms of an earlier phase of deconstruction such as "undecidability," "aporia," or "always already." Nonetheless, in treating an impressively wide range of texts in philosophy, theory, literature and economics, deconstruction is probably still the best overall term for signalling the sorts of close, critical readings Mieszkowski performs as well as for the underlying procedures, assumptions and goals that inform these readings. Indeed, one might convincingly see his study as carrying on the legacy of the later Paul de Man in so far as de Man asserted, in "The Resistance to Theory" (in Modern Literary Theory [2001]), that "more than any other mode of inquiry, including economics, the linguistics of literariness is a powerful and indispensable tool in the unmasking of ideo logical aberrations, as well as a determining factor in accounting for their occurrence" (280; my emphasis). In de Man's essay literariness signals the "autonomous potential of language" (279) to disrupt any stable connection between language, meaning and reference and thus to disrupt, or void, any aesthetic response in so far as such a response, to written texts at least, de pends upon a connection between language and phenomena. When one is, like de Man, analyzing texts with attentiveness to such disruptions and what they might imply about the nature of language and cognition one is, then, engaging in the "linguistics of literariness." Although the phrase isn't employed in Labors of Imagination (and de Man himself appears not to have employed it outside this one essay) it captures, I think, some of Miesz</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 183 kowski's central concerns. Indeed, Mieszkowski's most compelling and groundbreaking chapter, "Economics Beyond Interest" (Chapter Five), might best be understood as an analysis of the linguistics of literariness within certain landmark texts of economics. More particularly yet, Mieszkowski picks up some unfinished business contained in de Man's in triguing but elliptical remark that "those who reproach literary theory for being oblivious to social and historical (that is to say ideological) reality . . . are, in short, very poor readers of Marx's German Ideology" (280). In contrast to the "constructive hypotheses" that have dominated criti cism in recent decades, the book's "broadest thesis," as articulated with ad mirable clarity in its Preface, is that for the writers whom Mieszkowski will analyze an emphasis on the transformative dimensions of language does not, as is frequently assumed, culminate in the claim that something called "discourse" directs human activity and molds empirical reality. To the contrary, nineteenth-century analyses of discursive positing or perfor mance invariably question the status of language as a stable paradigm of thought, action, or construction, (xi) In his introduction Mieszkowski focuses initially upon Stanley Fish's work in legal studies, particularly Fish's argument, contra legal formalism, that a legal statute, or "act," has no meaning in and of itself. To understand the meaning of a legal act according to Fish is to reconstruct "the history that gave rise to it" and "the intentions of those who performed it" (Fish, qtd. in Mieszkowski 2)?a version of his argument, more familiar to those in literary studies, that the literary text has no meaning in and of itself but has its meaning constructed within "interpretive communities" which make of it whatever they will so long as the interpretive manoeuvers are recognized as legitimate by the community. The key problem with Fish's position for Mieszkowski is that it posits an unexamined opposition between an empty, and in itself meaningless, text and an historical context which is readable and reconstructable. Such a position, however, is as much of an untenable abstraction as that posited by formalists against whom Fish argued who see the text as sufficient in and of itself. "What Fish never asks is whether the relationship between a text and a context?a relationship that itself may or may not be a text or a context?will in turn have to be "read," or more significantly, whether it will be readable at all" (3). Having set the stage for his own later analyses by endeavoring in a pre liminary way to dismantle another stage upon which have stood "an entire generation of critics dependent on the [social and historical] site of a text's production as their principal explanatory paradigm" (4), Mieszkowski pro vides in the remainder of his introduction a thought-provoking discussion</page><page sequence="4">184 BOOK REVIEWS of Kant's third critique. He argues that it is the very nature of the aesthetic as Kant understood it that it creates through the imagination an experience which is irreducible to the material causes which underlie it. While this as pect of the third critique has been read as attributing a spurious freedom to the realm of the aesthetic and/or a transcendence of the social world, Mieszkowski's focuses upon how the argument "[disrupts] the basic tenet of genealogical analysis" of art inherited by Kant from thinkers like Alexan der Baumgarten and everywhere present in our own times. Likewise Mieszkowski emphasizes Kant's definition of an "aesthetic idea" as a "rep resentation of the imagination which prompts much thinking, but to which no determinate thought whatsoever, ie., no [determinate] concept, can be adequate, so that no language can express it completely and allow us to grasp it" (Kant, qtd. in Mieszkowski 5). Even to align the aesthetic and imagination with indeterminacy, a concept so often associated with de Man?an deconstruction, is to determine it too much. In his remarks on po etry which Kant argues "sets the imagination free" (qtd. in Mieszkowski 7), he theorizes a language which, in Mieszkowski's words, "is liberated not simply from limitations of subject matter or experience, but from the very polarities of determinacy and indeterminacy or position and negation" (7). What arises from Mieszkowski's discussion is a view of the imagination that "far from naming the power of a self to create itself or a world . . . threatens to derail or even to paralyze conceptuality, undermining the absolute pri macy of ideas that ostensibly defines Idealism" (7). Such a view of the imagination, although not new to deconstructive criticism of the Romantic era, is forcefully articulated by Mieszkowski, and his convincing location of such a view in the foundational texts of modern aesthetic theory is particu larly valuable. Such a view of the imagination remains an important, and once again timely, rejoinder both to the historical materialist's confident d?mystification of the theory of the imagination as an apologist for the he gemonic order (as in Nigel Leask's 1988 study, The Politics of Imagination in Coleridge's Critical Thought) and to the positive valorization of the visionary imagination both in mid-twentieth-century critics such as Abrams and Frye and enduringly in the culture at large. The subsequent chapters of the study further explore the power of lan guage to disrupt conceptuality and reference ("literariness" in de Man's phrase) exploring the ways in which such a power is recognized and mani fested in a variety of literary, economic and theoretical texts as well as the implications of such disruptions for our understanding of the aesthetic in its relation to social and historical context and for the understanding of human agency. Chapter One considers Friedrich Schlegel, a thinker who, in his theorizing of incomprehensibility and of Romantic poetry as a ceaseless striving after a goal which cannot be conceptualized nor even known to be</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 185 worthwhile, early on grasps the "confounding implications" (20) of Kant's arguments on the aesthetic. The latter stage of this chapter also contains a fascinating, and dare I say, entertaining, reading of Kafka's "The Hunger Artist" as an exploration, not only of the profound uncertainties about whether a performance is art, what it might mean if it is art, and what its value to society might be, but the even profounder uncertainty as to whether or not an artistic performance can even be said to have taken place. Mieszkowski suggestively frames his discussion of Kafka in the con text of more contemporary theoretical defenses of performance art as less rule-bound, more spontaneous, and therefore a more meaningfully present form of art. His reading functions partially as a dismantling of the assertions of such theories and thus as a dismantling of an enduringly powerful form of aesthetic ideology that could be extended well beyond avant garde art practices to, for example, the globally televised "town hall meetings" of American Presidential candidates that likewise appeal to their viewership on the basis of being more spontaneous and intimate?more "face to face." Chapter Two centers around a detailed reading of Heinrich Kleist's Prince Friedrich of Homburg as a play which radically questions the stable connec tion between language, thought, action and effect. If a larger theme can be drawn from such indeterminacy it may be something along the lines "with which Kant closes the Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals, namely, that we can only aspire to be moral agents insofar as we comprehend the in comprehensibility of our own freedom" (55). Chapter Three focuses upon Friedrich Schlegel's essays on political representation and the poetry of H?lderlin, in particular the poems "Voice of the People," and "Mnemosyne." This chapter, entitled "On the Poetics and Politics of Voice," is the most overtly indebted to de Man, particularly such late essays as "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric" and "Autobiography as De-Facement," in which de Man theorizes the processes, particularly prev alent in lyric and autobiography, wherein through a certain linguistic and tropological violence, we perceive language to be the voice of a particular speaking, existing, human subject. Mieszkowski, however, productively extends de Man's analysis to more overtly historical and political contexts to explore the sorts of questions that engaged the first generation of Ger man Romantics in the wake of the French Revolution, such as what is at stake in a supposedly democratic government when the state (an essentially voiceless entity) purports, as it must, to be "the voice of the people." A focal point, or point of return, for a variety of Mieszkowski readings is the concept of "interest." Economics is often understood as a study of competing interests within a society, self-interest chief amongst them. The aesthetic response by contrast, although it must somehow engage us, and thus interest us in a sense, is theorized in Kantian and post-Kantian aesthet</page><page sequence="6">186 BOOK REVIEWS ics as a response that carries no utilitarian or pragmatic response toward the object or image eliciting it and thus as inherently disinterested (a position which recent criticism frequently attempts to demystify as a ruse). All such discussions, however, presume some stable understanding of just what, in the first place, is interest. It's Mieszkowski's central achievement that he thoroughly defamiliarizes this concept which often stands so unexaminedly as the would-be foundation of both economics and aesthetics and that he does so, furthermore, without resorting to any unconvincing acrobatics but, rather, to well drawn evidence and sober analysis. Once again it is Friedrich Schlegel who stands as a precursor to such an insight when he writes: "In the entire realm of the science of aesthetics the deduction of the interesting is perhaps the most difficult and complicated task" (qtd. in Mieszkowski 22). In his central fifth chapter, "Economics Beyond Inter est," Mieszkowski demonstrates persuasively and with compelling insight how several landmark texts in the study of economics and politics?in the writings of Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham and Karl Marx?likewise founder (and flounder) over the concept of interest as well as other related terms which have been posited to be the foundational ground of such sys tems of thought, notably labor and the division of labor. Interest?the ety mology of which he informs, or reminds, us is "inter-esse, between being" (113)?arises in Mieszkowski's analysis as the sort of pivotal term classically ferreted out in Derrida's textual analyses, a term which cannot be said to belong to either side of a foundational opposition and which hence trou bles the stability and coherence of the opposition as well as the system founded upon it. This argument is made with particular clarity and force in Mieszkowski's fascinating discussion of interest in Bentham's would-be materialist ethics. "Interest [in Bentham's grappling with the term] func tions to confirm that fictions are fictions and real entities real entities, but it is not obviously part of either realm" (117). One does wonder, however, amongst such thought provoking discussions, why interest in the sense of a profitable return on an investment, although mentioned in passing, doesn't get more consideration. It is a dominant sense of the word and one with im portant implications for both language and economics as suggested by the tradition of theorizing "closed" and "open" economies (or the realm of "the proper" and the realm of "the gift") in various systems of exchange?a line of thought that moves through Bataille and Mauss to Cixous and Derrida. Mieszkowski's goal is not simply to demonstrate that the systems of Smith, Bentham and Marx are unstable, that they cannot establish them selves on a firm edifice. In and of itself, after four decades of deconstruction in its Derridian and de Man?an phases alone, such a demonstration might be somewhat unremarkable, even predictable. More compellingly what his</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 187 arguments endeavor to show is that thinkers like Smith and Marx "granted enormous privilege to language, not as an ideological or cultural phenome non, but as a constitutive feature of material reality. They suggest that eco nomic productivity is not reducible to a set of formative acts or exchanges and must be grasped in terms of a linguistic division that is potentially as ar bitrary or destructive as it is productive" (144). Thus at the roots of a sup posedly normative and hegemonic economic thought in Smith and of its critique in Marx is a thinking that grapples insightfully with the problem atic of language. Criticism which would extend Marx's historicist and ma terialist legacy, as so much of it endeavors to do, passes over such a prob lematic only by simplifying the legacy and by ignoring some of its most profound insights. Mieszkowski's final chapter treats Roland Barthes and Louis Althusser as two theorists of ideology who stand as formative influences within the cur rently hegemonic critical discourse of cultural studies. Once again Mieszkowski stays attuned to the moments within these theories when an attention to the problematic nature of language troubles the assertion of an unbroken connection between the signifier and material reality as well as to the problematic nature of ideology as a term which would mediate be tween the two. Although Mieszkowski is doubtless correct to suggest that Barthes and Althusser remain influential figures behind some strains of con temporary criticism, Labors of Imagination would have benefited from also engaging at least one of the more currently influential theorists behind the various forms of sociological and historicist criticism such as Bourdieu or Foucault. In not doing so the study misses an opportunity to more con vincingly develop its arguments against certain presently dominant forms of criticism as well as the opportunity to pursue more thoroughly the implica tions of its own positions. While the treatment of Fish in the introduction sets up later stages of the analysis nicely, Fish in and of himself is a bit of an odd choice to stand in for historicist, contextualist critics and theorists more generally as he seems to have had little influence amongst them and, indeed, is not really a strong case in terms of being one himself. Greenblatt is a better choice but he is dispatched too hastily in a paragraph connecting him synecdochally to the same assumptions as Fish. Likewise one would like to have seen Mieszkowski both present in greater detail, and more thoroughly engage, the sorts of contemporary arguments about the interre lations of economics and aesthetics that are the more particular object of his critique. For the most part, the mention of such works is consigned to brief end notes and thus the central issues under debate are not articulated as well as they might have been. A more pressing query about this work concerns the way it both gestures toward, but also skirts, or at least insufficiently works through, what</page><page sequence="8">188 BOOK REVIEWS Tilottama Rajan has referred to as "the ethical turn by which deconstruc tion [more recently] reasserts its difference from poststructuralist nominal ism" ("On [Not] Being Postcolonial" [2006])?a turn generally connected to the later work of Derrida and what he termed "affirmative deconstruc tion." Labors of Imagination not infrequently suggests that there are significant ethical and political stakes involved in the arguments it pursues. One certainly glimpses in places, as in the discussion of agency in Kleist and voice in H?lderlin, how this might be the case. On the whole, however, there is too little exploration and development of these implications. (Symptomatic of this problem perhaps is that Derrida's On Cosmopolitanism and Forgiveness, a work very centrally concerned with ethics, is listed in the Bibliography but, to my eyes, appears never to be referred to either in the main text or in the end notes). A searching conclusion might have been an excellent place to have developed some of the ethical and political implica tions the work hints at, but the book's two-page conclusion does little more than a quick once-over of its main points. If the study exhibits a certain discomfort with the ethical turn it simulta neously invokes, this discomfort may be attributable to an unexamined tension between different phases of deconstruction and different influences within it. As I have suggested, the work is most closely affiliated with the lines of thought developed by the later de Man, and de Man's criticism, while certainly ethical in its fashion, remained suspicious of recuperating any positivity, political or otherwise, from its own insights. In "The Resis tance to Theory" for example de Man suggests that theory flourishes in so far as it consists of language's "self-resistance" to systems of "conceptual generality" (275) and an attention to such self-resistance lies at the heart of Mieszkowski's study. "What remains impossible to decide," however, as de Man writes in the concluding line of his essay, "is whether this flourishing is a triumph or a fall" (288). One senses that Mieszkowski's sympathies lie with such a commitment to, in Zizek's phrase, "tarrying with the nega tive," and yet publishing his work almost a quarter of a century after de Man's last essays in a climate that has grown impatient with any theory that promises no positive returns, Mieszkowski feels some compulsion to at least gesture toward the ethical and political interests that might accrue from such lines of inquiry. The strong presence of Adorno in this study, some times regarded as an ethical, political deconstructionist avant la lettre, ap pears to be another facet of this difficulty, one which I can only note here in passing. Adorno is never himself the focus of one of Mieszkowski's ex emplary close, critical engagements, yet he is cited much more frequently than de Man or anyone else as a source of authority for the sorts of argu ments Mieszkowski pursues. Yet say what one will about the fascinating in sights provided by Adorno's work and how they may constitute a certain</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS 189 form of deconstruction, it is only by being quite selective that one can sug gest that he is a theorist of the materiality of language in the way in which this work is centrally concerned. My point, let me stress, is not that Labors of Imagination should have more clearly grounded its arguments in some sort of ethics and-or politics; in fact its rigorous attention to language is in sightful and refreshing in an era which has once again come to bypass such a problematic as being merely bothersome. My point, rather, is that the study seems to find itself betwixt and between an affirmative and, for lack of a better adjective, negative deconstruction in unexamined ways that con stitute a potential blindness in its otherwise frequently outstanding insights.
