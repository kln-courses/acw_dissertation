<plain_text><page sequence="1">RACHEL ZUCKERT Sculpture and Touch: Herder's Aesthetics of Sculpture Among the art forms identified in the eighteenth century as central?painting, music, sculpture, ar chitecture, and literature?sculpture has perhaps received the least focused attention from aestheti cians and art historians.1 Sculpture often has been treated, then and now, as one of the visual (or plastic) arts, together with painting, which latter has been the dominant focus of discussion. Even eighteenth- and nineteenth-century German aes theticians, who, in the wake of Winckelmann, take Greek classical sculpture as the paradigmatic art, discuss the specific artistic qualities of sculpture or the specific aesthetic experience it affords re markably little, often treating it under the more general category of plastic art. In this article, I propose to discuss a little-known treatment of sculpture from that German tradition, which at tempts precisely to argue that sculpture has its own norms and provides its own type of aesthetic experience, by contrast to painting: that of Johann Gottfried Herder in his work Sculpture: Some Ob servations on Shape and Form from Pygmalion's Creative Dream (first draft written in 1768-1770, and then revised, expanded, and published in 1778).2 Herder argues that sculpture is a distinc tive art form because it is directed toward and appreciated by the sense of touch, rather than vi sion. I shall suggest that Herder's attempt to define sculpture as an art form by reference to the sense of touch is not successful, but that his arguments are useful for making salient distinctive aspects of experience of (some) sculpture and making con nections between aesthetic theory and art critical discourse. More importantly, in attempting to ar ticulate an aesthetics of touch, Herder is strikingly innovative in the context of aesthetic theory of his time (and, to a large degree, ours), for touch has been considered to be a sense incapable of afford ing aesthetic experience. Touch has, moreover, been so considered because (it is believed) it is too connected to the body and thus (purportedly) too little connected to "higher" cognitive functions to afford aesthetic experience. Conversely, as I shall argue, Herder's account of sculpture?as an art ad dressed to touch, an art preeminently of and for human beings as embodied creatures?is a fruit ful, provocative starting point for the articulation of an embodied aesthetics. I shall begin by outlining Herder's proposed systematic aesthetic theory, of which his essay on sculpture was to be the first part, before turning to his arguments concerning sculpture. I shall then make some remarks concerning their interest and implications. i. herder's aesthetics in general Herder engages in detailed criticism of other eighteenth-century aesthetic theories, but in gen eral terms he shares their project: to understand the beautiful (and the sublime and other aesthetic qualities), which undertaking is, in turn, under stood as an investigation into properties of ob jects that are pleasurable to human beings, and the "underlying causes" of this phenomenon, that is, why and how they are thus pleasurable.3 Like the majority of his contemporaries, too, Herder holds that aesthetics concerns sensible representation or experience of objects: it is the sensible qualities of objects that are aesthetically pleasing, and aes thetic appreciation engages our sensible faculties or powers?the senses as well as imagination.4 In particular, Herder endorses (with some caveats) Baumgarten's definition of the beautiful as "sensuous perfection."5 Sensuous perfection?the The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 67:3 Summer 2009 ? 2009 The American Society for Aesthetics</page><page sequence="2">286 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism unity of multiplicity in the object and in our appre ciative experience of it?explains our pleasure in the object: it is such a unity of multiplicity and thus ontologically and epistemically valuable, and we, in experiencing this object, correspondingly best exert our sensible powers, engaging and uniting them in a rich, active way.6 Herder argues, however, that this definition is rather abstract, insufficiently descriptive of aes thetic experience, that is, of which objects of which kinds are connected to which feelings. To gain a sufficient theory of aesthetic experience, indeed to understand the meaning of 'beauty' so defined, Herder claims, we must trace this definition back to the sense experience upon which it is grounded and which it purports to describe. Like the classical empiricists, then, Herder believes that all concepts are both formed from sense experience and ulti mately meaningful by reference to the concrete character of such experience. This reference to sense experience is particularly necessary in a the oretical aesthetics, which after all aims to account for valuable sense experience.7 Herder's innovation is to propose that such meaningfulness can be obtained only if one at tends to the character of the different senses and their corresponding objects: though beauty (and the experience of it) is in every case a unified ap preciation of the unity of multiplicity in an object, the beauties for sight, for hearing, and for touch are substantively different from one another. For each sense receives information about different properties of objects, generates different concepts of those properties, and is unified, ordered, in its own operation in a different manner; each pro vides a different, specified concept of beauty.8 This sense-differentiated account of aesthetic experi ence will also, Herder claims, provide a differenti ated account of the arts, that is, as objects aimed to be beautiful for their respective senses: painting, music, and sculpture. (Tine art' may be generally defined as an object designed to be beautiful, but as in the case of 'beauty,' this definition is too general to provide a substantive ontology of the different arts.)9 As a basis for a systematic account of the arts, Herder's approach seems problematic: as for Hegel, who later similarly attempts to use differ ent means of sensible representation (or media) systematically to differentiate the arts, both litera ture and architecture cause difficulties for Herder, as neither appears to be directed toward a single sense. (And this is only to mention two other very central, recognized arts in the eighteenth-century "system of the arts.") I shall not, however, be con cerned with these issues, but shall now turn to the innovative aesthetics of sculpture Herder pro poses as part of this systematic approach. ii. herder's aesthetics of sculpture Herder argues that sculpture is addressed to the sense of touch primarily on the ground that touch provides us with distinctive concepts, that is, those that concern three-dimensional bodies as such: mass, weight, solidity, three-dimensional space (depth and volume), and three-dimensional form. (One might add here concepts concerning tex ture and temperature?smooth, rough, warm, or cold?though Herder does not emphasize this.) In support of this claim, Herder adduces the Molyneux question?whether a person born blind, who then regains his sight, could immediately, visually recognize a sphere or cube as known to him previously by touch or whether he must learn to correlate the three-dimensional shape with its visual appearance. Like Locke, Berkeley, and Diderot, Herder believes that the correct re sponse to Molyneux's question is the latter.10 Like them, too, Herder draws upon the empirical evi dence of William Cheselden's report concerning a formerly blind person who, after a successful cataract operation, did have to learn to correlate his visual experience with his prior tactile under standing of shape, to recognize color and under stand two-dimensional images (in mirrors or pic tures), and to interpret visual experience more generally, which appeared, first, simply as a "vast painted panel," an array of colors alongside one another.11 Such considerations more obviously support claims concerning the distinctive contribution of vision to cognition: the blind (and, at least ini tially, the formerly blind) cannot recognize colors or interpret two-dimensional images, and so forth. But they also suggest something, as Herder claims, concerning the cognitive contribution of touch: the blind and formerly blind do have concepts of three-dimensional forms, mass, volume, and so lidity, gained through their touch experience? and newly attained visual experience does not present bodies to them in the same way. Herder adduces evidence from children's development as</page><page sequence="3">Zuckert Sculpture and Touch 287 well: the child's need to reach for and grasp ob jects in order to understand them, their shapes, sizes, and distances, or to understand spatial depth more generally. These cases show, Herder sug gests, that we do not originally learn or compre hend three-dimensional shape, weight, depth, or solidity through sight, but rather through touch.12 And because sculptures are three-dimensional forms, Herder concludes, they are directed to ward, and appreciated by, the sense of touch.13 As it stands, this argument is problematic or at least incomplete: some (though I think not all) of these properties might well be learned through sight as well as touch.14 As Herder recognizes, moreover, sighted individuals integrate the expe riences and concepts derived from touch and sight into one global sense experience; we may have had to learn to do so, but as adults we interpret visual experience to be of three-dimensional ob jects, with weight and solidity, quite easily.15 And, as Herder also recognizes, we do not in fact (usu ally) appreciate sculptures by touching them, but rather by seeing them.16 (It confirms something of Herder's view, however, that we are often very tempted to touch them?but are prevented by mu seum regulations; sculptures accessible to touch are often worn smooth by repeated touching.) Herder therefore (in more careful moments) modifies his claim that we appreciate sculpture by touch: in aesthetic experience of sculpture, we em ploy imaginative touch, or, specifically, the sense of sight as "guided" by touch or as a substitute for touch; "[one's] eye becomes [one's] hand."17 But then we must ask: How, exactly, is vision "guided" by touch in these cases? How is such guided vi sion different from visual experience in general? Or, why must touch be invoked at all?if actually this is visual experience? Herder's answers to these questions are not en tirely clear. He does suggest that in such "guided" visual experience we must employ concepts de rived from the sense of touch, but this is insuffi cient to identify a specific function for touch in aes thetic experience of sculpture. On Herder's view, in nearly all visual experience, we employ such concepts (of things as solid, three-dimensional, and so forth), and he suggests too that the ex perience of painting?as representing objects that are three-dimensional?requires us to employ such concepts as well.18 Herder's chief answers are, I think, however, not cognitive but aesthetic, concerning our abil ity to have vivid, directly meaningful, and (impor tantly) unified, pleasurable sensible experience: "the beauty... of a body," Herder writes, "is not a visual but tactile concept."19 Herder takes vi sion to provide us with "abbreviations" of proper ties of bodies that we more directly know of and understand through touch?shadowing, for exam ple, to indicate three-dimensional form, or inden tation of supporting surface to indicate weight.20 Our direct, sensible, and vivid experience of these properties arises, however, from touch. One might think here of the difference between feeling the weight of something and seeing it weighed on a scale. In both cases, we understand the object to have weight, but in the second case, this under standing is inferential and (one might say) merely propositional, not a direct, sensible experience of the object's weight. For practical and cognitive purposes, these two ways of understanding weight may be interchangeable or the inferential one may even (as in this case) provide us with more ex act information. But for aesthetic purposes?for vivid, heightened, and pleasurable sense experi ence?they may not be. Thus, Herder writes, the "aesthetic terms that describe [the beauty of bod ies] ... derive from touch: rough, gentle, soft, ten der, full, in motion."21 Such aesthetic qualities not only depend upon (originally) touch-apprehended qualities of objects but are, arguably, such quali ties as pleasurable (striking, interesting, and so on) for touch. In experiencing sculpture, then, we do not (at least usually) in fact feel the weight, for example, of the sculpture?but we might use our vi sual experience in order to invoke, imaginatively, the felt (not visually "abbreviated") experience of weight, in order in turn to appreciate it as massive, threatening, balanced, and so forth. Similarly, Herder argues that through vision (unguided by touch) we cannot attain a unified experience of a sculpture?and this, given his un derstanding of beauty, is crucial to aesthetic expe rience and appreciation. He writes: The eye can approach a statue from whichever side it chooses, but it has only one point of view from which to inspect one part of the statue, as a surface, and so it must change that point of view as often as it desires to look on a different part of the statue, a different surface_ Painting is directed towards a single point of view;... for sculpture, however, there are as many points of view as there are radii in the circle that I can draw around the statue and from each of which I can behold it. From</page><page sequence="4">288 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism no single point do I survey the work in its entirety; I must walk around it in order to have seen it; each point shows me only a tiny surface, and when I have described the whole circumference, I have perceived nothing more than a polygon composed of many small sides and an gles. All these small sides must first be assembled by the imagination before we can conceive of the totality as a body. And this bodily whole, is it then a product of my eye? Or of my soul? Is the effect, which it shall achieve only as a whole, a visual sensation? Or a sensation of my soul? In this art, therefore, the effect of the whole is completely lost on the unmediated eye. So there is definitely no sculpture for the eye! Not physically, not aesthetically. Not physically because the eye cannot see a body as a body; not aesthetically, because when the bodily whole vanishes from sculpture, the very essence of its art and its characteristic effect disappears with it.22 This "essence" and "characteristic effect" Herder describes as its beautiful form and beautiful shape_The beautiful line that constantly varies its course is never forcefully bro ken or contorted, but rolls over the body with beauty and splendor; it is never at rest but always moving for ward, creating the flow and fullness of that delightful, gently softened corporeality that knows nothing of sur faces, or of angles and corners. This line can no more be made into a mere visible surface than it can be made into a painting or an engraving, for then it loses everything that is proper to it.23 These quotations contain a number of different points, including the frequently made observation that we tend to appreciate sculpture by moving around it; Herder's presupposition that sculpture is, paradigmatically, of human form is also hinted at here in his phrase, the "gently softened corpo reality" of the sculpture. I will return shortly to these issues (a bit). In the meantime, however, I wish to call attention to the central argument in both passages: through vision, we do not attain ex perience of the sculpture as a whole, as unified, but only experience a series of surfaces from different viewpoints, which inferentially and incompletely add up to a representation of the work as a whole. Specifically, Herder suggests that the "beautiful line," the "unity in diversity, with a gentle flow" of the sculpture is not representable visually, or in a two-dimensional image.24 In order to attain a grasp of the continuity, the softness, gentleness, roundness, of the "line" of the sculpture, we must imagine (in our "souls") touching that line, fol lowing it around the figure; we must "destroy" the separateness of the different visual angles or view points, must invoke touch experience of grasping a solid, feeling it from all sides at once, or in one continuous motion.25 Herder's argument here in part relies on a (perhaps questionable) assumption, shared (for example) with Berkeley, namely, that our own movement and consciousness thereof belong to touch (and thus, as I shall suggest below, kines thetic perception is, on Herder's view, one form of touch).26 Thus, information gained?such as conti nuity, here?through motion, and implicit compre hension of our own motion, is allocated to touch, not vision. Vision alone provides "snapshots" of a visual field from one fixed perspective, and thus the three-dimensional curve of the sculpture can not be grasped as a whole by vision alone (by any of these particular "snapshots"). More specifically, however, Herder's argument here is rather simi lar to that recently proposed by Robert Hopkins concerning the difference between visual experi ence and painting and the experience of sculp ture: painting always portrays objects from and for a fixed (visual) point of view, whereas sculp ture does not present or enjoin a particular per spective.27 In Herder's (and not Hopkins's) terms, insofar as we move around the sculpture in order to gain a nonperspectival grasp of the sculpture, from all sides at once, such visual experience aims at, is guided by, a conception of bodies as they are for touch. Herder's point is, however, again also nor mative: though we can construct a visual im age of a three-dimensional object by looking as we move continually around the object (whether piecemeal, as on Herder's view, or otherwise), the smoothness, roundness, and continuity of this curve is, he suggests, pleasing to (imaginative) touch, not per se visually. Here again visual ex perience is guided by and directed toward gener ating the kind of experience afforded by touch, and also, importantly, a value?fullness or round ness of form?appreciated by touch. Herder provides two further arguments for the necessity of imaginative touch in experience of sculpture, which are based on specifically artistic considerations. First, Herder at various points sug gests that touch is important in appreciating sculp tures because it replicates the artist's experience. (The communication of experience from artist to</page><page sequence="5">Zuckert Sculpture and Touch 289 audience is one function of art, on Herder's view.) That is, artists make sculptures by employing the sense of touch, feeling the contours of the object, shaping these through physical, touch engagement with the materials.28 Though Herder does not de scribe this in detail, Henry Moore's description of sculptural making is (I believe) almost exactly what Herder would say: a sculptor must strive continually to think of, and use, form in all its spatial completeness. He gets the solid shape, as it were, inside his head?he thinks of it, whatever its size, as if he were holding it completely enclosed in the hollow of his hand. He mentally visualizes a complex form from all around itself; he knows while he looks at one side what the other side is like; he identifies himself with its centre of gravity, its mass, its weight; he realizes its volume, as the space that the shape displaces in air.29 As suggested here, the artist's touch, like the ap preciator's, might in a number of cases be imagina tive, rather than actual, touch: Moore's "holding" the object in his hand is imaginative, and in the case of bronze casted sculpture, his sculptures are not, in fact, themselves ever created by the artist's own touch, but rather as a casted copy of a plaster model.30 Still, if we are to replicate the experience of the sculptor, as expressed and communicated in the sculpture, we too must (imaginatively) employ the sense of touch. Second, Herder suggests that we grasp the unity and the expressive meaning of sculpture through identifying with sculpted human form again through imaginative employment of the sense of touch, in the form of proprioception, that is, our feeling of the comportment and position of our own bodies (as is suggested by Moore in the above quotation as well).31 Though we do not tend to class proprioception as a form of "touch," it is, too, a sense of a solid body with volume, located in three-dimensional space, in contact with other bodies?a sense of touch, one might say, of and from the inside. And this form of touch informs, on Herder's view, our experience of sculpture: Because [a sculpture] presents a human being, a fully an imated body,... it seizes hold of us and penetrates our very being, awakening the full range of responsive hu man feeling? It possesses the power virtually to trans pose our soul into the same sympathetic situation. The rise and fall of the breast and the knee, the way the body rests quietly, revealing the soul?all this passes silently and incomprehensibly over into us: we find ourselves, so to speak, embodied in the nature before us, or the na ture in question is enlivened by our own soul_Nothing must be merely observed and treated as if it were a sur face; it must be touched by the gentle fingers of our inner sense and by our harmonious feeling of sympathy.32 In claiming that we "transpose" ourselves into the stance of the sculpted form, I suggest, Herder means that we imaginatively, projectively use pro prioception to experience the sculpture, again as a whole, here specifically a whole human body, and in turn are affected, sympathetically, in our feeling of our own bodies.33 Imaginative proprioceptive identification al lows us, Herder suggests, to understand the ex pressiveness of the sculpture, the way in which the comportment of the sculpture can express fit ness, health, strength, well-being, emotional states, or tendencies to action, that is, the way in which this (represented) body is "ensouled," "alive," ac tive. Herder writes: "the beauty of the human body... is always the expression of health, life, strength, and well-being in every limb of this artful creature... [and] is something that can be grasped and felt by all who are able to recognize in them selves or in others the form of life, the expression of force in the human vessel."34 We do not, that is, simply "read" visual cues?a frown "means" sad ness or anger, or a ripple "means" strength, say in accord with conventions of representation, but rather "feel our way" into the stances and ex pression of the body represented, and thus feel the strength, sadness, or anger of a living body with such a stance.35 This projective identification too grounds a (pleasurable) sense of the sculp ture as a whole?this time not simply of the form itself, its "rounded contours," but also of the sig nificance, the lived meaning, of human bodies in these shapes, and again visual experience would be instrumental to such grasp of expression. III. SOME PROBLEMS Herder uses this analysis to ground rather "essen tialist" ontological and aesthetic claims concern ing norms of sculptural making and appreciation. Sculpture is, as quoted above, in "essence" beau tiful form (made by human beings to be so and to communicate experience thereof). Sculpture is, therefore, defined as three-dimensional form</page><page sequence="6">290 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism (with mass, solidity, volume), and specifically, in accord with an evaluative definition, form charac terized by rounded, full, continuous contour and expression. From this definition, Herder believes, one can derive various "rules" concerning sculp ture: it should not be colored beyond the color belonging to its medium (for color is irrelevant to and distracting from the sculptural essence); it is, at its best, sculpture of human forms, specifi cally unclothed human forms; it should avoid de tailed representation of veins, locks of hair, and other items that might disrupt the "slow" and "ob scure" sense of touch in its grasp of unified form; it should be of single figures, not of groups (for the essence of sculpture is to be and to portray one single form).36 Correspondingly, one ought to appreciate sculpture through imaginative touch, attending to its contours as "felt" or projectively proprioceived, but not to its color, context (be yond its single form), and so on.37 These strong definitional claims and pre scriptive conclusions of Herder's analysis seem problematic. For his definition does not iden tify characteristics belonging to sculpture alone. The three-dimensionality (or weight or solidity) of sculpture does not, ontologically, distinguish sculpture from most paintings and architectural works, which are also three-dimensional objects (and so forth). We might follow Kendall Walton in arguing that for sculpture, and not for painting, these qualities are "variable" rather than "stan dard" properties; they are not merely ignorable preconditions for the properly artistic enterprise (such as presenting a two-dimensional image), but ones the specific character of which informs our judgments and experience of the work.38 We might add, in Herder's defense, that he identifies a distinction between (much) painting and sculp ture: (most) paintings have and enjoin a single viewpoint, whereas (most) sculptures do not.39 Still, judgment and appreciation of architectural works are likely, too, to invoke (variable) proper ties of weight and solidity?and architecture may also be understood as presenting single forms, to be appreciated from many (or no particular) viewpoints. Thus, though Herder has identified some char acteristics that may be essential to (much) sculp ture, he has not articulated a distinct essence for sculpture. Nor do the exclusive normative, prescriptive implications Herder takes to follow from this putative distinctive essence seem to fol low, or indeed to be plausible in themselves.40 Herder's claim that color or light is irrelevant to sculptural appreciation seems questionable, particularly given Herder's immediate purpose, namely, to explain and vindicate the colorlessness of Greek sculpture, which has since Herder's time been shown to be historically false. And similar things could be said about sculptural groups; the Laocoon already should cause Herder some diffi culty on this count. These lines of argument seem also to be based on fallacious reasoning: even if sculptures essentially appeal to the sense of touch, there is no reason why they could not in addition appeal to the sense of sight (not merely as guided by touch)?by using color, by engaging considera tion of composition (a visually based capacity, on Herder's view)?as well.41 It seems, moreover, unlikely that our appre ciation of sculpture is ever, solely, imaginative touch (or "eyes that become the hand"): for most sculptures, a darting visual, cognitive apprehen sion of the form?for example, to recognize that it represents a human being?seems crucial for our appreciation. In other words, I am not con vinced, as Herder appears to be, that a blind person's appreciation of sculpture through actual touch is an identical (or extremely similar) ex perience to imaginative-touch-informed appreci ation of sculpture by the sighted. Nor, on the other hand, is it obvious that paintings (the paradig matically visual, not tactile, art form on Herder's view) could not appeal to the sense of touch (in addition to requiring the use of concepts derived from touch); paintings might call for the replica tion of the artist's physical motion in making, or imaginative proprioceptive identification.42 All of these claims, as well as Herder's sugges tion that sculptural value is to be found only in "rounded" contours of the human figure, more over, seem called into question by later sculpture, whether the elongated, unrounded figures of Gia cometti, the geometrical, nonhuman forms of min imalism, or the importance of light and color for sculptors such as Dan Flavin. Indeed, the Laocoon and Michelangelo's tortured, elongated sculptural forms already raise questions about Herder's ac count?at least in its strict letter, its emphasis on rounded form, its identification of sculptural value with sculptural beauty (as the only aesthetic or artistic value). These queries and doubts call into question, I think, however, only a rather strong reading (endorsed, indeed, by Herder) of the</page><page sequence="7">Zuckert Sculpture and Touch 291 consequences of his account. On a weaker read ing, Herder identifies possible modes of value or appreciation of (some) sculpture (as well as pos sibly works from other forms)?an aesthetics of touch?an identification which is, strikingly, inno vative in light of the aesthetics orthodoxy of his time. IV. AN AESTHETICS OF TOUCH On the standard eighteenth-century view, it is more frequently assumed than argued that only vision and hearing?and not touch?can provide aesthetic experience. It appears, however, that this claim is grounded upon the view that these two senses allow us to represent objects as distinct from us, as complex, and as representational?and thus only visually or aurally experienced objects can afford pleasures arising from the representa tion of perfection (a complex order among parts or properties of the object), recognition of artistic skill, mimetic accuracy, or (more broadly) plea sures distinct from those of satisfying "mere" bod ily desires.43 Touch, by contrast, is seen as brutish, with little to no "objective content" or complexity thereof, insensible to mimetic representation, its operation and pleasures tied strongly to the satis faction of bodily needs and desires. As Herder writes, his analysis of sculpture is meant to show that "touch may not be that crude a sense after all, since it is properly the organ of all sensation of other bodies, and hence has a world of fine, rich concepts subject to it."44 Ac cordingly, Herder identifies a number of different sensory qualities accessible to touch, as we have seen, and also (though not explicitly) a number of different types of touch itself. On Herder's ac count, there appear to be at least four varieties of touch.45 They are (in my terms): 1) tactile: our access to the "feel" of surfaces, apprehension of qualities such as rough, smooth, cold, and warm; 2) haptic: our apprehension of solids as single ob jects, possessing three-dimensional shape, through grasping them; 3) proprioception; and 4) kines thetic perception, namely, our feelings of motion, orientation of ourselves (our bodies) in space, as confronted by other spatial objects.46 This last, on Herder's view, is important as our ability to trace the "line" of a sculpture (as we have seen) and as the source of our comprehension of depth; it may also conjoin with proprioceptive identification in our grasp of a sculpture as portraying a moving fig ure, as in Baroque sculpture?which Herder does not mention?or figures such as the Laocodn.41 Thus his account suggests that touch experi ence might be itself complex (involving a com bination of touch responses) and be of an object as complex?both as having different parts in re lation, and as having a complex of (more or less nuanced) properties, such as cold, hard, bumpy, narrow, flat, heavy, vertical, irregular, cylindrical, and having an ovoid base. It seems that we could be aware of an object, as having all such prop erties and parts, through touch, and thus also for those properties to appear coherent (or not) to the sense of touch. One could add to this list?meant to describe a Giacometti figure?properties of which we are aware through proprioceptive and kinaes thetic perception and identification, such as rigid, lonely, slender, or sharply slicing the surround ing space. The object of proprioception?and thus of projective, identificatory proprioception?is in general complex, as it is a grasp of the various parts of the body in relation to one another, in particular locations. In the case of a Giacometti, aesthetic pleasure is likely to arise not primarily from the imagined tactile and haptic "grasp" of the figure, but from its expressiveness as gleaned from proprioceptive identification; whereas, in the case of classical and neoclassical figures (or indeed of a Brancusi), the tactile and haptic qualities of smoothness and rounded form must contribute to aesthetic appreciation?and perhaps too to an ap preciation of the artist's skill in making.48 I should note here in more general terms that Herder, unlike the classical empiricists, does not think of sense experience, including aesthetic ex perience, as fundamentally composed of distinct, atomic sensations, "simple ideas," or simple re sponses of pleasure. On his view, sense experience is pervaded by judgment?by recognizing similar ity, connection, and distinction?and characterized by ordering relations; he lists for vision, the rela tion of "side by side," for touch, of depth and inner-outer, and for hearing, succession 49 Somewhat hesitantly, I suggest too that these modalities of touch could represent something like mimetic accuracy or representation (though I think both are likely to be aided by visual in formation). In the case of representation of hu man figures, there is (on Herder's account, but in terms borrowed from Wollheim) a twofold ness characteristic of representation, namely, an</page><page sequence="8">292 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism oscillation between the recognition of the sculp ture as formed stone (or bronze or wood)?as it is of course recognized to be visually, but also could be recognized to be on tactile and haptic grounds (as cold, hard, and so on)?and the projected pro prioceptive sense of the sculpture as "living," ex pressive, active. Insofar as the sculpture achieves expressiveness?insofar as one can "transpose" oneself into the figure's stance, its muscularity or weakness, its strength or lassitude, feel its emo tional and active states by "inner sense"?one can, too, appreciate (if not explicitly or as such) some thing like mimetic accuracy by touch. That is, through such proprioceptive imaginative touch, one is aware of the sculpture's representational success in portraying living, expressive bodies, and through this, states of the "soul." Or, in Herder's terms, sculpture may, in a sense, be understood as "allegory," as an embodied soul or a body repre senting a soul.50 Throughout Sculpture, indeed, Herder obses sively and to my ear oddly refers to sculptures as "living" forms, though here he does not dif fer from much art critical description of figura tive sculpture, nor from the (rather broader) us age of 'living form' as a gloss for beauty in the German aesthetic tradition.51 In the Western tra dition, such references are embodied in the Pyg malion myth, to which Herder refers in the subtitle to Sculpture and which might be taken to be his guiding metaphor. This myth suggests the "oscilla tion" between taking the sculpture as representa tion and taking it as the represented (as living) just sketched: Pygmalion falls in love with the sculp ture, taking it to be nearly, as if, a living woman; the successful sculpture prompts such response, such desire. But he also recognizes that it is in fact not alive, not a real woman; once Galatea is alive, a real woman, the sculpture as art object has van ished.52 (This myth is also suggestive concerning the role of sexual attraction in our pleasure in fig urative sculpture of human bodies, to which issue I will return.) In the case of nonfigurative sculpture (or sculp ture representing nonhuman objects), these rep resentational or mimetic experiences will not be, as such, forthcoming. On the one hand, such sculptures might be understood as self-conscious refusals of proprioceptive identification, of the "direct, tacit, and idealized self-recognition that [might be taken to be] at the heart of a prob lematic anthropomorphism deeply embedded in the sculptural tradition."53 That is, we might un derstand later sculptures not precisely as coun terexamples to Herder's claims, but as aiming to do something different from, indeed something self-consciously opposed to, the earlier (and con ceptually or aesthetically prior) sculptural appeal to proprioceptive identification that he describes. (And some sculptures, such as Dan Flavin's work, might be understood to be even more distinct from traditional sculpture, perhaps as a new art form, such as three-dimensional manipulation of light.) On the other hand, such sculptures may offer a somewhat similarly bifurcated experience for (imaginative) touch, an experience of inside and outside, proprioceptive identification and exter nal haptic grasp. As the Moore quotation above suggests, one may imaginatively "feel" the shape of a sculpture "from inside" and "from outside"? inhabiting its volume, grasping its shape?even if it is not a human form. One might, then, find these imaginative touch experiences to "mesh" easily or not, the "inside" to be easily imaginable from ex perience of the exterior surface or not.54 Such at tempts to "match" inner and outer are no longer, indeed, representational or mimetic (even in an extended sense), but they might be taken to mirror the structure of expression (on Herder's view)? the manifestation of the "inner" in the "outer"? and might therein provide an experience pleasur able to and unificatory of touch (or, indeed, a more ambiguous experience?perhaps of the sublime, or of irony?if the "inner" and "outer" are not so eas ily "matched"). Thus, against the consensus of his time, Herder suggests that touch (or imagined touch) can af ford pleasures from the representation of com plex order in an object, the artistic skill man ifested therein, and (to some degree) mimetic accuracy. As I have suggested, I do not believe that Herder's analysis provides a successful defini tion of sculpture or an account of sculptural value and appreciation as utterly distinct from those of all other art forms. But it does make salient and explain the reasons for the substantive, "thick" concepts?of mass, volume, inside-outside, life, an thropomorphism, and so on?relevant to at least some sculpture and appreciation thereof (and per haps not as much to works of other forms), which are employed in actual, art critical discourse con cerning sculpture. (By contrast to the abstract are general concepts proposed in the accounts pro posed by Herder's contemporaries, which do not</page><page sequence="9">Zuckert Sculpture and Touch 293 generate such links with, or explain, art critical dis course.) Correspondingly, Herder's account raises interesting, specific art-theoretical or critical ques tions pertinent to understanding the experience of sculpture in particular, for example, concerning the relationships among the different modalities of touch and the qualities therein sensed. Similarly, Herder's theoretical differentiation and "thick" description of particular kinds of aes thetic experience can guide the appreciator (or perhaps artist) in identifying what is of value or important, what she should attend to and appreci ate, in specific types of objects (here sculpture). As Herder writes: "Through [philosophy] I can form judgments of taste with a certainty and distinguish beauties in a light in which they had not appeared to me before."55 Herder's emphasis upon the phys icality of touch in both appreciator and artist, for example, could explain (and encourage) art his torical and critical discussions concerning the aes thetic effects of the "mark" of the artist's hand?as, for example, in Rodin's or indeed Moore's sculp ture?and of the texture and mass of the particular material employed, effects that are in their phys icality more central to sculpture and its appreci ation than to that of works in other forms. And Herder's account suggests, too, a reason for the primacy of human figures, even the single human figure, in the tradition of sculpture, as opposed to that of other art forms, notably painting.56 By contrast, if one is influenced by a one-sided theory, Herder argues, one can fail to appreciate objects that do not have the characteristics and types of unity identified by that theory as beautiful (or, more broadly, one's favored form of aesthetic value).57 Thus, for example, Herder remarks at various points that the sense of touch is "obscure" and concentrates on the given, physical reality before it. As a result, he argues, wit, allegory, orna ment, and complexity more generally are alien to sculpture and distract from its primary aim of pre senting a single form, comprehensible to and ap preciable by (imaginative) touch.58 Again, taken as exclusionary and prescriptive, these claims seem too strong: Claes Oldenberg's gigantic ham burgers and clothespins may well be both witty and (in some sense) allegorical, appreciable not, I think, through any sort of proprioceptive iden tification, but rather, say, as ironic "comments" upon modern materialist, consumerist culture and the intrusiveness of trivial, trashy, manufac tured objects upon ordinary life in late capitalist society. But Herder's suggestions concerning the simplicity and "literalness" of touch might (as he claims) explain why simplicity?lack of complex ity, lack of irony, and so forth?may nonetheless be deeply pleasing in sculpture (and perhaps also in architecture) as they may not be in works of other art forms, in that they provide the "slow" sense of touch with an object "graspable" easily as a unified, definite form, with "inhabitable" volume, smooth surface, and follow-able contour. The values of simplicity and immediacy may not, that is, be in conflict with other values?such as complexity or irony?but rather may derive from different sources of valuation; such values might, then, be unappreciated and unappreciable if one is guided by a single, universal, or abstract theoretical conception of aesthetic value.59 Herder's elaboration of an aesthetics of touch has broader implications, as well, for a recon ception of aesthetic experience?as embodied. As noted above, eighteenth-century aestheticians tended (implicitly or explicitly) to dismiss touch as a source of aesthetic experience not only be cause it fails to provide appropriately complex or cognitive representation, but also because it is the sense most connected to bodily pleasures and de sires. After the eighteenth century, this conception of aesthetic experience has come under consider able criticism, both on descriptive and normative grounds. In general, it is alleged, such a view falsely treats the human being as an essentially unlocated, disembodied mind?whereas we are, in fact, em bodied beings. In the context of aesthetics, where it is frequently associated with the claim that aes thetic pleasure is disinterested, such a view seems particularly questionable concerning the appreci ation of Greek nude sculpture (taken by many, not just Herder, to be paradigms of sculptural beauty). Sexual attraction seems to be a paradigmatic form of interest, and it is not obvious that such attrac tion is not, in some way, responsible for our plea sure in the representation of ideal, nude human form in such sculpture.60 These denials of em bodiment and sexuality have, moreover, seemed morally and politically questionable: they obscure the material conditions (social and physical) that make possible such putative disembodied know ing or disinterested regard, and they devalue the goods and pleasures of our embodied condition. Herder?remarkably?anticipates many of these criticisms. Like some twentieth-century critics, Herder suggests that philosophers</page><page sequence="10">294 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism (particularly aestheticians) overemphasize vision, the "coldest" and "most philosophical" sense.61 Herder suggests that philosophers are inclined to emphasize this sense because of their own charac teristic preferences and interests (in abstraction, in universality, in an "overview" of the multiple particulars of the world). Their theoretical pro posals therefore occlude the character of sense experience other than that of sight, and, as his language suggests, implicitly thereby downplay (if not devalue) emotive response and immediacy of impact. (Indeed this philosophical neglect of embodiment could in turn explain, in the terms of Herder's account, aestheticians' neglect of the specific aesthetics of sculpture.) Herder also resists distinguishing aesthetic experience and pleasure strongly from other sorts of pleasure, and particularly doing so by using disinterest edness as a criterion of the aesthetic. Insisting upon aesthetic disinterestedness, on Herder's view, renders the experience of art trivial and disconnected from lived experience and the goods to which we are committed, including sexual desire and pleasure.62 On Herder's view, we are fundamentally embodied beings, which embod iment should be recognized as the condition for, and contributor to, all our other activities, including intellectual ones?just as the concepts of touch are, he argues, a condition for and crucial contributor to visual experience of physical objects?and should, consequently, be valued. Unlike many later critics, however, Herder at tempts to provide substantive descriptions of what an embodied aesthetics would be like in his aes thetics of sculpture.63 The aesthetic experience of sculpture is, on Herder's view, preeminently an ex perience of, by, and for humans as embodied crea tures. The paradigm sculpture is the expressive representation of human form. Aesthetic appreci ation of sculpture calls upon the appreciator's abil ities precisely as an embodied being: she must not only employ concepts that arise from her own em bodiment (her use of the sense of touch), but must also move around the sculpture in order to gain a full understanding of the work and its presence in space; she must proprioceive in order to under stand the sculpture's "life" and expressiveness. Herder also acknowledges the presence of sex ual interest and desire in appreciating (some) nude sculpture. Herder treads carefully and speaks somewhat ambiguously here, probably be cause of his cultural context?he states several times that he does not mean to corrupt "morals"? but he does suggest that the viewer's sex (or, we might say, sexual orientation) influences his or her appreciation: "alongside our universal feeling as human beings there is also a specific feeling proper to our sex" and "where it is armed by passion rather than blinded by it, the judgment of one sex upon the other is extraordinarily precise."64 Sexual attraction need not "blind one" but can heighten one's attention to the perfection of the human body, the smoothness and tactile appeal of its surface and contours.65 Likewise the artist may be inspired to create beautiful forms by his "em brace" (real or imagined) of beautiful bodies 66 Here, one may note, lies Herder's chief dif ference from Hegel, who later also analyzes the value of Greek sculpture as lying in its accomplish ment of the "embodiment"?or, in more Hegelian terms, "realization"?of ideas such as freedom or virtue in human, real, sensible form. But Hegel, unlike Herder, continues to hold that aesthetic ex perience is primarily, normatively contemplative; the embodied realization of ideas in sculpture is to be recognized cognitively?not embraced, even in imagination. Indeed Hegel not only endorses contemplative (disembodied, nonsexualized) ap preciation, but also praises Greek sculptors for deemphasizing sexual organs and traits in their represented, sculpted human forms.67 On Herder's view, then, by contrast to many of his predecessors, contemporaries, and successors, sexual interest or (more generally) bodily involve ment in aesthetic experience need not vitiate the aesthetic quality or moral standing of apprecia tion of art. Quite the contrary. As we have seen, our embodiment contributes crucially to aesthetic appreciation of sculpture on Herder's view. More over, like other eighteenth-century aestheticians, Herder claims that aesthetic experience is con nected both to morality and to self-knowledge; unlike them, however, he emphasizes that the em bodied character of aesthetic response to sculp ture contributes to both of these important ends.68 We are embodied beings, and the aesthetic expe rience of sculpture provides us with a heightened, unified, invigorating experience of that embodied condition. We are, and should recognize that we are, in contact with other physical bodies, includ ing other human beings, in the world; we are and should be touched and transformed by that con tact with others. It falsifies not only the experience of sculpture, but also our mode of existence itself,</page><page sequence="11">Zuckert Sculpture and Touch 295 to understand ourselves solely, in the first instance, or at our most valuable, as "cold" philosophical, detached, disinterested spectators.69 RACHEL ZUCKERT Department of Philosophy Northwestern University Evanston, Illinois 60208 internet: r-zuckert@northwestern.edu 1. For reasons that will become clear, I shall be con cerned here exclusively with sculpture in the round, not reliefs. 2.

I also draw from Herder's briefer but consonant treatment of sculpture in his "Fourth Critical Forest" (written in 1770); citations to this work are from Herder, "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove, On Riedel's Theory of the Beaux Arts" in Selected Writings on Aesthetics, ed. and trans. Gregory Moore (Princeton Uni versity Press, 2006), pp. 177-290. 3. "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," p. 188.

"Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," p. 195. 6. Herder does not gloss the Baumgartenian definition explicitly in this way (I have drawn, rather, from the elabo ration of Baumgarten's view by Moses Mendelssohn in his "Letters on Sentiments"). But Herder's view seems to fit this description (see, for example, "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," pp. 197-198). 7. "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," pp. 211-214. 8. "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," pp. 211-212. Herder dismisses taste and smell as senses that can provide experi ence of the beautiful because they are mere modifications of the sense of touch ("Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," p. 210). However, on his own grounds, this dismissal seems mistaken: taste and smell do not render us aware of the characteristic qualities of objects (as three-dimensional solids) that are the province of touch. 9. See Norton, Herder's Aesthetics, for discussion of Herder's attempted ontology of the arts. Herder's differenti ation among art forms bears some resemblance to Lessing's attempt in his Laocobn to differentiate literature from visual art and (as Herder notes) to suggestions in Scottish aesthet ics that 'beauty' properly applies only to visual objects of aes thetic experience and only metaphorically to musical works. Unlike Lessing, however, Herder is not most interested in establishing rules for correct mimetic representation, but in articulating the distinctive character of aesthetic experience of different objects. And unlike the Scots, who appear to be following ordinary linguistic usage, Herder attempts to give a reason both for the primacy of a visually based un derstanding of 'beauty' and for its inadequacy to provide an account of beauty in general. (Because sight most eas ily affords recognizable experience of unity amid diversity, Herder argues, visual beauty is the first example to come to mind; this does not mean, however, that the other senses do not also?and differently?afford an experience of unity amid diversity.) Relevantly for our concerns, none of these writers differentiates sculpture from painting. 10. Sculpture, p. 33ff.; "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," pp. 207-209. Herder refers to Locke implicitly in quot ing Locke's famous claim that a blind person does not truly understand the meaning of 'scarlet' in comparing it to the sound of a trumpet (Sculpture, p. 40; "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," p. 210), but he is more directly influenced by Diderot's "Lettre sur les aveugles." As far as I am aware, Herder was not familiar with Berkeley's New Theory of Vi sion, though he concurs with Berkeley's view that depth or distance are not seen, but understood through touch (and then inferred from or projected upon visual information proper); George Berkeley, An Essay Towards a New The ory of Vision, reprinted in Works on Vision, ed. Colin Mur ray Turbayne (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merill, 1963). Herder's claims are, however, considerably less extreme than Berke ley's; for example, he allows that visual experience provides information concerning spatial position. As a realist, Herder also holds that our visual experience is of the same bodies that we touch (not of separate visual images, as Berkeley claims). Far more than Berkeley, moreover, Herder focuses upon solidity, three-dimensional contour, and volume of bodies as (in the first instance) inaccessible to vision. In other words, it is crucial for Herder (as it is not for Berke ley) that Molyneux's question concerns spheres and cubes, not squares and circles. 11. Sculpture, p. 34. William Cheselden was a surgeon whose report concerning a boy's recovery of vision after an operation to remove a cataract was initially published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of Lon don 402 (1728): 447^150; this report was widely read and discussed in the eighteenth century. For a more recent and more ambiguous case study of a similar case, see R. L. Gre gory and J. G. Wallace, "Recovery from Early Blindness," Experimental Psychology Monographs, vol. 2 (Cambridge: Hefner and Sons, 1963). The patient studied in this mono graph quickly recognized shapes presented visually that he had known previously by touch; he was also able to draw a tool using vision, but from tactile memory. More gener ally, the Molyneux question is currently often dismissed by researchers as unhelpful because the formerly blind per son's vision is not "normal" at first (as Diderot argues as well) and by philosophers on grounds of theoretical commit ments concerning concept use; see Morton A. Heller, "In troduction," in Touch and Blindness: Psychology and Neu roscience, ed. Morton A. Heller and Soledad Ballesteros (Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 2006), p. 2; and Janet Levin, "Molyneux's Question and the Individuation of Per ceptual Concepts," Philosophical Studies 138 (2008): 1-28. These arguments for dismissing the Molyneux question are, it seems to me, however, potentially question begging. As Herder himself notes, a more pressing objection may be that data about the sensation of the blind (or formerly blind) may not be determinative about the character of sensation for the sighted; for example, Herder argues that the blind can hear subtleties that the sighted cannot, because the latter rely</page><page sequence="12">296 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism more heavily on vision ("Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," p. 206). 12. Herder also proposes a thought experiment: if we were to encounter an object that we could not touch and had to find out about only by vision, we would never come to obtain a "true concept" of it as a body, with solidity, volume, and mass ("Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," p. 217). This seems wrong; for example, astronomical observations have generated concepts of planets other than Earth as solid and so forth, without any touch experience of them. However, it remains plausible that these conceptions are inferentially gained (from indications given in vision) and would not be available to us without some touch experience to gain the concepts of solidity and so forth in the first place. 13. Herder also claims that touch provides us with expe rience of bodies as "real" or in their "truth," whereas sight gives us the mere "appearance" of bodies (or of their sur faces). This claim plays a large role in Herder's aesthetics of sculpture: our experience of sculpture is the experience of the "living embodied truth" of a real body, whereas paint ing is mere representation of mere appearance, with conno tations of illusion and dream-likeness (which connotations are not, however, meant to be derogatory; see, for example, "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," p. 209). I relegate this line of argument to a footnote because a discussion of its merits (or lack thereof) would take me too far afield. I will note briefly, however, the chief problem with it for my purposes. Though Herder's claim that sculptures are "realities"?they present real bodies, not mere appearances or mere repre sentations to us?has significant resonance in critical writ ing about sculpture, it seems (particularly for Herder's core case, namely, classical Greek sculpture) obviously false. A sculpture of a Greek hero is not a real human body, but a representation of one. The impetus to present something that is "exactly what it is" may well motivate later sculpture, par ticularly minimalism, but here Arthur C. Danto's analysis of purportedly nonrepresentational art in The Transfiguration of the Commonplace seems apt: insofar as a Robert Morris sculpture (as it were) proclaims, "I am precisely what you see," it is not precisely, only, what one sees; The Transfigu ration of the Commonplace: A Philosophy of Art (Harvard University Press, 1981), for example, pp. 2-3. 14. This appears to be the current consensus among em pirical researchers, particularly concerning comprehension of space or spatial concepts, which are taken to be gleaned from vision more than touch; see Susanna Millar, "Process ing Spatial Information from Touc and Movement: Impli cations from and for Neuroscience," in Heller and Balles teros, Touch and Blindness, pp. 35-38, and Thomas W. James, Karen Harman James, G Keith Humphrey, and Melvyn A. Goodale, "Do Visual and Tactile Object Representations Share the Same Neural Substrate?" in Heller and Balles teros, Touch and Blindness, pp. 139-155. No finding suggests that touch is, as Herder alleges, necessary for the formula tion of three-dimensional spatial concepts or comprehen sion thereof. It is not clear, however, that researchers have established that vision can provide such concepts in the ab sence of touch, and they are of course largely testing adult viewers who (on Herder's view) would have fully integrated their touch-derived comprehension of three-dimensionality into their visual experience. Such evidence might, however, be a reason to differentiate among the concepts Herder claims to originate in touch. Some, like weight and solid ity, might derive wholly from touch; others, such as depth and volume, from touch and vision; and others again, such as spatial location, primarily from vision (though perhaps partially from touch). 15. Sculpture, pp. 37-38. 16. Sculpture, p. 40; "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," pp. 217-218. Herder is less clear than he might be on this point, but he explicitly does not?as does Herbert Read, who propounds a touch-based aesthetics of sculpture in the twentieth century?argue that we cannot appreciate sculp ture properly without actually touching it. Read's view is re markably similar to Herder's?if more historically than the oretically argued?though he appears to be unfamiliar with Sculpture. See Herbert Read, The Art of Sculpture (New York: Pantheon Books, 1956). 17. Sculpture, p. 41. 18. Specifically, Herder quotes Cheselden's report, which states that the patient at first saw paintings as pan els of different colors in two-dimensional shapes, and had to learn to interpret these paintings as representing three dimensional objects; Sculpture, pp. 34-35. If Herder takes this observation seriously, on his own line of argument, it would suggest that all of us employ concepts gained orig inally from touch in interpreting or experiencing (most) paintings and indeed most visual experience (as Herder rec ognizes, in referring to touch as providing a "foundation" for visual experience by furnishing concepts of real, inde pendent physical objects). 19.

"Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," p. 218. 25. "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," p. 218-219. Con sonantly with Herder's suggestion, some blind people have reported imagining objects as "wholes," not from one par ticular side?as they have discovered that sighted peo ple and visual pictures do; see Heller, "Introduction," p. 6, and "Picture Perception and Spatial Cognition in Visu ally Impaired People," p. 55, in Touch and Blindness. Herder also suggests that the "slowness" and "obscurity" of touch prevents grasping an object as unified (Sculpture, pp. 93-94); this aspect of Herder's view is emphasized by Alex Potts in The Sculptural Imagination: Figurative, Mod ernist, Minimalist (Yale University Press, 2000, pp. 30-31). This apparent inconsistency might be mitigated by suggest ing that in this context (where he is discussing "colossal" sculpture), Herder intends to be characterizing the sublime, rather than the beautiful, for touch. Nonetheless, one might propose that because touch involves contact with the ob ject, it could undermine our sense of our own bodily in tegrity or unity, or of the independent unity of the object. Herder suggests something of this sort in explaining why the representation of corpses in sculpture is not pleasing: "The sculptor who offers to our sense of touch the revolt ing form of a corpse... so that we become one with it... for such a hangman of our pleasures I can find no fitting name. [For appreciating]... a sculpture requires that I slowly and blindly feel my way forward, until I register a gnawing at my</page><page sequence="13">Zuckert Sculpture and Touch 297 flesh and bones and the shudder of death along my nerves" (Sculpture, pp. 56-57). 26. Berkeley, New Theory of Vision, ?? 93,97. 27. Robert Hopkins, "Painting, Sculpture, Sight and Touch," British Journal of Aesthetics 44 (2004): 149-166. Hopkins does not identify this claim as Herder's (though he does cite Herder on other points), but see Sculpture, p. 93. Contra Herder, Hopkins denies that this lack of fixed perspective means that sculpture is directed toward, or ap preciable primarily by, imaginative touch. 28. Sculpture, pp. 41,91. 29. Quoted in Read, The Art of Sculpture, pp. ix-x. 30. I am grateful to Ted Gracyk for this point. 31. As I shall discuss below, Herder's conception of touch is capacious, including proprioception and kines thetic perception, though this has not been noted in prior discussions of Sculpture (for example: Potts, The Sculp tural Imagination; Hopkins, "Painting, Sculpture, Sight and Touch"; Norton, Herder's Aesthetics, chap. 6; Jason Gaiger, "Introduction" to Sculpture). Gaiger, for example, takes the later parts of the work to concern expression, as distinct from the first "theoretical" part concerning the concepts of touch. I would argue that Herder rather is developing his concep tion of the contribution of touch to sculptural aesthetics over the course of Sculpture as a whole. One significant result of recognizing this broad meaning of 'touch' in Herder's work is that proprioceptive identification might allow Herder to resist an argument raised by Hopkins against the proposal that sculptural appreciation is guided by the sense of touch: that touch is a sense with "multiple" points of contact with its object (or 'content,' Hopkins's term), whereas (Hopkins argues) we do not experience sculpture as being in contact, at multiple points, with some other body. If we experience sculpture by imaginative proprioception, however, we do "touch" the sculptural figure at every point?from the inside, in contact with its surface as our "outer skin." (Herder's sug gestion that we are enjoined imaginatively to trace the lines of the sculpture in a continuous motion also might comprise an enjoined "contact" with multiple points of the sculpture, though not precisely "all at once.") 32. Sculpture, p. 81. 33. See Robert Vance, "Sculpture," British Journal of Aesthetics 35 (1995): 217-226, for a similar suggestion (though not in terms of "proprioception"). Barbara Mon tero argues that we in fact?not merely imaginatively? proprioceive the motion, gesture, and comportment of dancers, drawing upon recent neurophysiological discover ies concerning mirror neurons; Barbara Montero, "Propri oception as an Aesthetic Sense," The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 64 (2006): 231-242, especially pp. 236-238. It seems to me, however, that there is a difference between engagement with other bodies (or represented bodies) and the feeling of one's own bodily comportment (one is con scious that it is someone else's body, not one's own, that is moving, for example). Nonetheless, as Herder suggests, such imaginative engagement at least sometimes does affect our feeling of our own bodies, and we might even "mirror" in our own bodies the stance of the figure. The precise character of this experience thus would warrant further investigation. 34. Sculpture, p. 11, Herder's emphasis removed, empha sis in text added. This statement is Herder's summation of his extensive discussion (following Winckelmann's enthu siastic descriptions of Greek sculptures) of the meanings of facial features and bodily comportment in sculpture in Part III of Sculpture. 35. Herder's passage from p. 81 articulates a causal or der in the "other direction" from what I suggest here, that is, because the sculpture presents an animated body, it prompts us to "transpose" ourselves. This may be so, but such experi ence does call upon our proprioceptive sense and an ability imaginatively to project such proprioception. The reversed order that I suggest is the best sense I can make of how it can be, as Herder suggests, that (in our experience of it) a sculpture is an animated or living form. 36. Herder announces these aims?to generate "rules" and "subjective laws" of appreciation?at Sculpture, pp. 42 43; he articulates the various laws in Sculpture, Parts II and IV. 37. Herder often frames these claims as explanatory of the greatness of Greek sculpture, rather than prescriptive. Even as explanatory, however, they would still have the pre scriptive consequences I state in the text. (That is, if one claims that the essence of sculpture is x, which explains the success of sculptures, such as Greek sculptures, then this claim generates the prescriptive implications: one ought to make sculptures having x or one ought to appreciate sculp tures by looking for x, if one is successfully to make or appreciate them.) 38. Kendall Walton, "Categories of Art," The Philosoph ical Review 79 (197): 334-367. 39. See again Hopkins, "Painting, Sculpture, Sight and Touch." I qualify Hopkins's and Herder's claims because some paintings, such as Cubist painting, aim to present (and enjoin) different viewpoints at once, and some sculp tures (particularly those made for an architectural context) may enjoin particular perspectives. Cubist painting seems, I note, to support Herder's suggestions concerning the polygonal angularity of the combination of multiple visual perspectives. 40. On Humean (or other) grounds, one might resist Herder's inference from essential to normative more gen erally, that is, one might deny that x is essentially y entails that x ought to be y?rather than (as I argue here) deny that x is essentially and distinctively y, and then that this entails (or would entail) that x ought exclusively to be y. As I have been arguing, however, Herder's identification of sculptural essence is already thoroughly normative; thus the more gen eral inference is almost pleonastic on his view. Discussion of the legitimacy of such evaluative definitions of art (or of art forms) is beyond the scope of this essay. I owe this clarification to Brian Soucek. 41. One might also (though Herder does not) suggest that there is a touch-related way to attend to light in appre ciation of sculpture, as opposed to directly appreciating light effects as such?color, brilliance, shadowing, reflections, and so on. In appreciating sculpture, we might see light by con trast as itself touching the sculpture, delineating its form and contours. See Read, The Art of Sculpture, chap. 6, for a dis cussion of many light effects (not, however, including this one) in sculptural appreciation. 42. For example, Merleau-Ponty analyzes Cezanne's paintings as portraying the encountered solidity of objects (thus enjoining imaginative touch, and perhaps imaginative kinaesthesis and proprioception). Much abstract expres sionism engages the viewer through its gestural evocation of the artist's physical motions in making.</page><page sequence="14">298 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 43. For a representative statement concerning the non aesthetic character of touch, see G. W. F. Hegel, Hegel's Aesthetics: Lectures on Fine Art, trans. T. M. Knox, 2 vols. (Oxford University Press, 1975), p. 38. Current analytic aes theticians have, for some time, resisted the long-standing distinction between "higher" and "lower" senses, as well as the (often correlated) disinterestedness criterion; see, for example, Carolyn Korsmeyer, Making Sense of Taste: Food and Philosophy (Cornell University Press, 1999); Larry Shiner and Yulia Kriskovets, "The Aesthetics of Smelly Art," The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 65 (2007): 273-286. Closer to Herder's concerns are Richard Shuster man, "Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal," The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 57 (1999): 299-313; Montero, "Proprioception as an Aesthetic Sense"; and Sherri Irvin, "Scratching an Itch," The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 66 (2008): 25-35. Though Herder shares certain aims with these approaches?to recognize the fundamen tally embodied character of human beings and resist the mind-over-body valuation of traditional philosophy, to en courage broadened aesthetic appreciation of more objects and qualities, and thereby (if possible) to promote a height ened sensible engagement with everyday life?his aims are nonetheless somewhat different. He aims indeed to vindi cate "lower" sensibility, but by doing so also to provide a richly descriptive set of concepts that would contribute to critical attention to the arts and that would enrich au dience appreciation. (Here he is perhaps closest to Mon tero 's essay, which aims to provide an approach for under standing another art?dance?that has received less attention in philosophical aesthetics than it deserves.) Herder also, as noted above, endorses a traditional conception of aes thetic value (beauty) and wishes systematically to specify that value. I suspect that he would consider current discus sions in general to widen, weaken, and render yet more abstract our basic understanding of aesthetic experience, rather than providing the more substantive "thick" descrip tion that he aims to provide. Irvin's essay is a case in point here. 44. "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," p. 209. 45. Herder is not alone in his period in classing these somewhat various senses together under "touch." Berkeley and Reid, for example, appear so to class kinaesthetic per ception and (probably) proprioception; see Berkeley, New Theory of Vision, ??45, 93, 97, and Thomas Reid, An In quiry [1863], ed. Ronald Beanblossom and Keith Lehrer (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1983), pp. 35,47. These meanings of "touch" are not inconsistent, though one might like an ac count of why they together constitute a natural class (which I cannot provide here). I suggest, though, that they have in common some sort of reciprocity with the objects sensed: one both touches and is touched. That is, all of these types of touch are both an orientation toward an object or a world, providing cognitive content, and also are a case of being "touched by" the world, by that content. (This includes, if oddly, proprioception, in which one is both object and sub ject of touch.) Such reciprocity is not characteristic of other senses (one is not heard or seen in hearing or seeing some thing), though these senses are also, of course, activated by contact with items in the world. 46. There appear to be no established terminological dis tinctions concerning modes of touch, though proprioception appears to be the most fixed among these terms. 47. Herder also suggests a connection between "touch" and "feelings" or emotions; in German, as in English, "touch" or "feel" terms (primarily Gefuhl)?as well as "mo tion" terms (as in 'moving' or indeed 'emotion')?can refer to emotional states as well as to tactile, haptic, propriocep tive, or kinaesthetic perception. There are reasons, beyond linguistic association, for Herder's assimilation of emotions to proprioceptive touch in particular: emotional states are (at least in part) states of the body?heat, lassitude, and stomachache are experienced in anger, depression, and anx iety?and thus apprehended, in part, through propriocep tive awareness broadly understood. As was a predominant theme in Herder's time (particularly in the work of Lavater), facial expressions?which are configurations of one's body are also associated with emotional states. We do not, more over, merely understand others' emotions from their facial expressions?though we do do this?but also can induce emo tional states in ourselves through assuming the correspond ing facial expressions. See Paul Ekman, Emotions Revealed (New York: Henry Holt, 2003), for contemporary psycho logical research on these points. 48. I have purposefully chosen examples from modern art to suggest that Herder's account can apply to them. Read's argument that modern sculpture fully realizes the potentiality of sculpture to appeal to touch also could serve as corroboration of this suggestion. 49. "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," pp. 177-178, 216. 50. Sculpture, p. 96. As Herder recognizes, such repre sentation is not standard allegory (usually understood to be both conventional representation and representation of an abstraction such as virtue), but for my purposes here, it could count as representation more broadly. More needs to be said than Herder does about how this "allegorical" representa tion is different from actual, ensouled human beings and our experience of them. Perhaps one difference is that in attend ing to sculpture, we have better warrant to interpret expres sion as both meant and "veridical"; it does not make much sense to say that this sculpted or represented person merely "appears" to be healthy, calm, and foresighted, whereas we do make such appearance-reality distinctions concerning our "readings" of expressive features of actual human be ings (for example, she looks unreliable, but this impression is inaccurate). More generally, contra Vance, "Sculpture," I believe that there is both room and need for an account of representation (perhaps in terms of "twofoldness") in sculpture. 51. See, for example, Friedrich Schiller, On the Aesthetic Education of Man in a Series of Letters, ed. and trans. Eliz abeth M. Wilkinson and L. A. Willoughby (Oxford: Claren don, 1967), letter 15, pp. 100-101, for usage of "living form" in philosophical aesthetics; and Read, The Art of Sculpture, and Potts, The Sculptural Imagination, for critical use of 'life' as an aesthetic category for sculpture. Potts suggests that the "living" character of sculpture as experienced is gained through close attention?we attend to the surfaces of the sculpture, as well as move around it, and oscillate be tween detailed and distanced perception. Though Potts is no doubt right that such attention is a component of sculptural appreciation, it is surely just as relevant for the appreciation of painting, and thus cannot explain the prevalence of the terms 'living,' 'moving,' and so forth in critical descriptions of sculpture in particular.</page><page sequence="15">Zuckert Sculpture and Touch 299 52. I am grateful to Lydia Goehr for discussion on this point. 53. Stephen Melville, "Richard Serra: Taking the Mea sure of the Impossible," Res 46 (2004): 185-201, at p. 185. Melville is speaking here specifically of Serra, but this statement seems potentially applicable to a wide range of modernist and minimalist sculpture. Melville suggests that Serra's use of thin solid planes is meant to refuse such iden tification more successfully than the inscrutable boxes of minimalism, which?Melville suggests nicely?are like peo ple who wear sunglasses inside: we do not take them to have no "inside," but rather understand them to be purposefully withdrawing such an "inside" from our attention. Serra's planes, by contrast, have no "inside" whatsoever. (Insofar as Serra's planes are impressive to us as weighty and force ful, however, on a Herderian view, they might well be taken to have an "inside" in the sense of inner force.) 54. See, for example, Potts's analysis of Hepworth's sculpture, which employs such terms; Sculptural Imagina tion, pp. 151-158. 55. "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," p. 182. 56. Perhaps because he aims to celebrate twentieth century sculpture, Read both acknowledges the predomi nance of the human form in the sculptural tradition and dismisses it as not truly central to sculpture: he claims that it arises from a primitive, narcissistic urge to self-expression, which is apparently obviated in later art. Herder's sugges tion, by contrast, that we appreciate sculpture through pro prioceptive identification does not dismiss such representa tion as primitive (though it may be in some sense narcissistic, for the appreciator as well as artist) and, I note, can explain the continuing prevalence of human (or humanoid) forms, even among the sculptors most admired by Read, such as Moore. 57. Herder claims explicitly that (his) aesthetics is a theo retical enterprise, aimed to understand aesthetic experience and value, not to inculcate taste or promote appreciation; "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," pp. 189,191. But here we see that this theoretical enterprise can?perhaps necessarily does (as it is an evaluative account)?have critical and eval uative consequences. As is frequently the case in Herder, these consequences are less prescriptive than exhortative: theoretical distinctions can lead one to take more and dif ferent pleasures in different kinds of values. 58. Sculpture, p. 91 ft 59. Herder suggests such benefits of his in-principle plu ralism about aesthetic value in the Fourth Critical Forest ("Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," p. 200). Such pluralism, he emphasizes, does not mean that there are no "rules" of beauty, nor that one must simply identify a disposition to cause pleasure as the sole defining feature of beauty, as that alone which such objects have in common, but rather that for different sorts of objects, there will be different, but nonetheless substantive, "rules." 60. As acknowledged, for example, by Kenneth Clark in his work on the nude. It is attested in much criticism of sculpture, including this striking example by a critic (Ci cogna) of Herder's time, writing of a Canova figure: "All the senses are delighted in a way that is easier to experi ence than describe.... The chisel is the last tool that comes to mind, for if statues could be made by caressing marble rather than by roughly carving and chipping, I would say that this statue has been formed by wearing down the sur rounding marble by dint of kisses and caresses," quoted in Potts, The Sculptural Imagination, p. 43. 61. "Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," p. 205. See Nor ton, Herder's Aesthetics and the European Enlightenment, p. 206ff., on the emphasis on vision in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century philosophy and intellectual culture. 62. Herder criticizes the concept of disinterestedness and the distinction of aesthetic from other pleasures most force fully in his late Kalligone (1800), an in-depth criticism of his "Kant's 'Critique of Aesthetic Judgment.'" 63. Many critics appear to endorse the definition of aesthetics that they attribute to their opponents: aesthet ics as such?the study of the beautiful, of our experience of it, the characteristic qualities of objects that prompt or are the intentional objects of our responses?is premised on a "disembodied" conception of the aesthetic subject. Thus in rejecting this conception, they appear to reject the project of aesthetics altogether. Critics like Pierre Bour dieu, for example, seem to endorse replacing such analysis by a sociological analysis of the circulation of objects within class and social status structures. Any focus on the individ ual's response to a particular object thus drops out of the picture. 64. Sculpture, p. 86. Herder is, as noted, ambiguous on this point: he also states that sculpture should not arouse sexual interest?only a "beast" would be so attracted?and that painting, more than sculpture, arouses the erotic imag ination; Sculpture, p. 52. 65. The nature and role of such sexual attraction in ap preciation of figurative nude sculpture, on Herder's account and in general, merits more discussion than I can provide here. In general, such attraction must in some sense be imag inary: hardly anyone wishes to have sex with a formed piece of stone, wood, or bronze. For Herder in particular such at traction would, moreover, seem oddly narcissistic: in order to experience the sculpture as "living" (and thus sexually at tractive), one must projectively identify with the sculptural body. But sexual desire would seem to be a desire for the other, not for oneself, a desire (imaginatively) not to iden tify, but to caress, to engage in tactile, haptic, kinaesthetic touch. Thus it is difficult to see how, on Herder's account, we can both experience the sculpture as (or as if) living, from the "inside," and also as other, from the "outside," both of which seem required for finding the sculpture (as if) sexually desirable. 66. This claim is often conjoined with Herder's praise of the (purported) healthiness of Greek relations among the sexes; see Sculpture, pp. 53, 74-75. 67. See Hegel, Lectures on Fine Art, pp. 31-37,476-478, 483-485, 728-729, 744-745, 835. 68. Herder suggests this connection in criticizing Riedel for denying it ("Critical Forests: Fourth Grove," pp. 181 182) and it is presupposed throughout Parts II and III of Sculpture. 69. I am grateful to students in my graduate seminars on eighteenth-century aesthetics at Rice University and North western University for spirited discussion of Herder's aes thetics of sculpture, which aided my thinking on these mat ters a great deal. I am also grateful to Anne Eaton, Lydia Goehr, Barbara Montero, Brian Soucek, and audiences at CUNY Graduate Center and at the Aesthetics Anarchy con ference in Bloomington, Indiana, for comments on earlier drafts of this essay.</page></plain_text>
