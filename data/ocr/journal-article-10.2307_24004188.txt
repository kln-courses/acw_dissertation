<plain_text><page sequence="1">John P. Welle Introduction. From Pastrone to Calvino: New Perspectives on Italian Film and Literature* "History is, in effect, a science of complex analogies, a science of double vision: the facts of the past have meanings for us that differentiate them and place them ... in a system under the sign of contemporary problems. . . . History in this sense is a special method of studying the present with the aid of the facts of the past." (Èjxenbaum 56) This volume provides an Italian perspective on an issue of great moment: the historical interactions of film and literature. While film study is well established in American universities, and American Italianists, like specialists in other national languages and cultures, have long been interested in the cinema, there have been few attempts to open up dialogue between scholars working in different sectors of the academy. A common subject matter does not necessarily lead to shared concerns nor have developments in film studies always been integrated into the work of specialists in language and literature. Moreover, despite the healthy number of American film journals, academic conferences, and new film books, the rich vein of theory and scholarship currently being mined in Italy is all too little known on this side of the Atlantic. Intended to bring together the contributions of scholars who work from different perspectives, who address different audiences, and who utilize different critical methodologies, Annali d'ltalianistica 1988 provides a forum for research within a broad and evolving field of inquiry. As the essays in this volume indicate, the discourse on film and literature, however extensive the treatment it has already received, remains potentially one of the most promising ways of contributing to the further evolution of film studies, to the growth of literary knowledge, and to the advancement of our understanding of cultural change. This volume represents the fruit of collective efforts. I would like to express my gratitude to our numerous contributors whose rich essays and stimulating book reviews exemplify the vitality of Italian studies. A special word of thanks goes to my colleague, Dino S. Cervigni, who assisted me in this project with his counsel, with his editorial skills, and with his expert handling of the many technical aspects involved with its publication. I would also like to thank my colleagues Kathleen Biddick, William Krier, and James Peterson for their helpful comments regarding the Introduction. Finally, I am grateful to Dr. Robert Gordon of the Office of Advanced Studies and the Jesse Jones Faculty Research Fund at the University of Notre Dame for financial support during the early stages of this project, to Dr. Roger Skurski, Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Letters, for providing me with a computer during the critical final months of this initiative, and to Patrick Wilson, who has been one of AdI's most valued collaborators throughout the past three years.</page><page sequence="2">Introduction. From Pastrone to Calvino 5 Adl 1988 covers a wide range of interrelated theoretical and historical issues. From Giovanni Pastrone's epic film Cabiria (1914) to Italo Calvino's final novel Palomar (1983), this volume spans the decades of the twentieth century and re-examines the touchstones of Italian film and literature. The list of contributors reflects the journal's policy of publishing essays by distinguished scholars as well as by their younger colleagues. These essays synthesize and take up issues treated in previous work, while they also break new ground, point to ongoing research, and raise questions in need of further exploration. The product of careful planning (this project was announced in 1986) while remaining open to serendipity (articles were still being considered at the last possible moment), the resulting volume gives an accurate picture of the present state of scholarship. In addition to the detailed bibliographies which accompany the individual essays, an excellent annotated bibliography of recent Italian scholarship is supplied by Stefania Parigi in the Aggiornamento bibliografico.1 By way of introduction, therefore, I propose to underline the key issues raised by the contributors, to emphasize the new perspectives that they bring into focus, and to outline a few areas for further exploration. Because the contributions are presented along broadly historical lines the reader will be able to trace the trajectory of film and literature in Italian culture by reading this volume from cover to cover. In my discussion of these essays, however, I will group them according to the topics that they address, namely: 1) new approaches to adaptation which move beyond fidelity analysis, 2) the influence of film on literature and the evolution of cinemorphic literary texts, 3) film history and literary history, 4) the role of the screenwriter, 5) film, language, and cultural politics. The ways in which national cinemas have utilized literature, in both canonized and non-canonized forms, constitute an integral element in the development of every national cinema. Antonio Costa, a contributor to this volume, has recently commented elsewhere on the universal character of this process. E' fisiologico che ogni cinematografia attinga regolarmente ai classici della letteratura nazionale, rinnovi periodicamente le proprie trascrizioni delle opere fondamentali, in relazione ai mutati gusti del pubblicco, della rinnovata sensibilité estetica, morale e politica, e metta in cantiere trascrizione di nuove opere nel frattempo entrate nell'olimpo dei classici (piccoli o grandi). ("Comencini" 57) (It is physiological that every cinema draws regularly upon the classics of the national literature, renews periodically its own transcriptions of the fundamental works in relation to the changed tastes of the public, to the renewed aesthetic, moral, and political sensibility, and that it begins the transcription of new works that in the meantime have entered into the Olympus of the classics [minor or ' In addition to the works cited in Parigi's bibliography, see also Brunetta "Introduzione" and "Cinema e letteratura"; as well as Micchichè and Catania.</page><page sequence="3">6 John P. Welle major].) (All translations in this article are my own.) Reflecting the continuing interest in this topic, six of the essays in the present volume, as well as Lawrence Baldassaro's interview with Francesco Rosi, deal specifically with adaptation. Moreover, many of the other essays touch on adaptation in the context of pursuing diverse lines of inquiry. As is well known, the discourse on adaptation in the past has tended to privilege the literary text in the adaptation process and to obscure elements of cinematic specificity by concentrating on the filmmaker's "fidelity" to the source text. Both individually and collectively, the essays gathered here move beyond fidelity analysis and explore new approaches to what remains the most often discussed topic in studies on film and literature.2 While the need to certify a filmmaker's "fidelity" to a literary source has been uppermost in the minds of many critics, Luciano Morbiato demonstrates that this quality has not always been universally appreciated. In his essay "Dalle ambiguità drammatiche di Fogazzaro ai dagherrotipi parlanti di Soldati," Morbiato asserts that Mario Soldati's films of 1941, 1943, and 1947 based respectively on Antonio Fogazzaro's Piccolo mondo antico, Malombra, and Daniele Cortis sought to remain close to the spirit of the original novels. Soldati's attempts to accurately portray nineteenth-century traditions in literature and painting within the cinematic context of the late 1930s and 1940s earned him the scorn of neorealist critics. Morbiato notes that it was precisely Soldati's faithful illustrations of his literary sources that brought about the accusations of formalism and calligraphism that have been leveled against him. Bringing a new perspective to bear on "fidelity," Leonardo Quaresima sheds light on adaptation and on neorealism in his essay "La scure, il rogo (e il fucile): La Lupa, da Verga a Lattuada." Concentrating on different versions or "refractions"3 of Giovanni Verga's La Lupa, primarily the novella, the prose drama, and Alberto Lattuada's film of 1953, with further references to the opera libretto, the screenplay, and the popular narrative based on the film, Quaresima analyzes the transformation of individual elements in the story through various media and various historical contexts. What importance should we give to the question of fidelity, Quaresima asks, when the intertextual exchanges proliferate to such an extent that it becomes difficult to ascertain which "source" or "original" is being adapted? The declining authority of the literary "source" text and the creative energies 9 For a thorough bibliography of some 2,500 articles and books on film and literature in English from 1908 to 1985, see Ross.

Refractions or refracted texts, as Lefevere defines them, are "texts that have been processed for certain audiences, children, e.g., or adapted to a certain poetics or a certain ideology" (13).</page><page sequence="4">Introduction. From Pastrone to Calvino 1 of the filmmaker provide the point of departure for Âine O'Healy's essay, "Re envisioning Moravia: Godard's Le Mépris and Bertolucci's II conformista." Focusing on two films based on novels by Alberto Moravia, O'Healy argues that Godard and Bertolucci make adaptation a "dynamic, self-conscious part of the filmmaking process" and that both directors "explicitly challenge the assumption that it is the task of the filmmaker to remain faithful to the spirit of the literary work." O'Healy reflects on the Oedipal conflicts and tensions at the center of the adaptations by Godard and Bertolucci. In doing so, she points to broader issues concerning paternity, authority, and questions of influence, which, as O'Healy argues, inform not only recent theories of literary history but can also be deciphered in film texts and film history as well. In a similar fashion, the autonomous vision of the filmmaker and the genesis of his or her artistic creations are explored by Peter Bondanella in his essay, "Literature as Therapy: Fellini and Petronius." Observing that Federico Fellini "has consistently opposed adaptations or transpositions of literary works," Bondanella studies the biographical factors underlying Fellini's turn to literature for artistic inspiration during a difficult moment in his life. Pointing to the filmmaker's sketches and dream notebooks as important sources of insight into the oneiric qualities of Fellini's films, Bondanella describes the process through which the filmmaker moves from sketches and drawings, to the scenario, to the screenplay, and finally to shooting the film itself. Thus, Bondanella develops a philological approach to adaptation which is anchored in the filmmaking process.4 A further contrast regarding the attitudes of filmmakers toward adaptation is provided by Douglas Radcliff-Umstead in his essay, "The Journey of Fatal Longing: Mann and Visconti." Luchino Visconti and his scriptwriter Nicola Badalucca, according to Radcliff-Umstead, sought to "respect the integrity of the original text" and "strictly translated with Morte a Venezia to signify the autonomy of Mann's vision." Analyzing the intertextual relations between Thomas Mann's novel, Visconti's film, and Benjamin Britten's opera, Radcliff Umstead reminds us of film's omnivorous capacity to draw the other arts into its ken. The filmmaker selected well-known musical compositions to evoke the setting of Mann's literary masterpiece. Thus, Radcliff-Umstead enriches the discourse on adaptation by calling attention to the function of music in Visconti's film art. The functions that adaptations themselves can play is the subject of John J. Michalczyk's essay, "The Political Adaptation: Petri and Rosi Film Sciascia." Focusing on three films adapted from the novels of Leonardo Sciascia, Michalczyk places both the literary works and the resulting films within the context of Italian politics in the 1960s and 1970s. In analyzing the work of ^ For an analysis of the making of La Strada, see Bondanella and Gieri.</page><page sequence="5">8 John P. Welle Francesco Rosi and Elio Petri, Michalczyk points to the ways in which their films address social problems and seek to participate in political discourse. Social and political problems, primarily with regard to the South, also emerge from Lawrence Baldassaro's interview with Francesco Rosi in which the filmmaker discusses at length his adaptation of Carlo Levi's Cristo s'èfermato ad Eboli. Having discussed the essays on adaptation as individual contributions, I would now like to briefly summarize their collective significance. The essays by Morbiato, Quaresima, O'Healy, Bondanella, Radcliff-Umstead, and Michalcyzk demonstrate that adaptation is no longer viewed as a phenomenon whose critical boundaries have been definitively established for all time. Rather, these essays illustrate the complexity of the adaptation process: transforming a literary text into a film text is an activity that participates in and depends upon a host of other factors. These factors can involve the choice of literary and pictorial icons as in the case of Soldati, the basic parameters of the film industry during a particular historical moment as in the case of Lattuada, questions of influence and the choice of models as in the case of Bertolucci, elements of personal biography as in the case of Fellini, the attitude toward high cultural sources as in the case of Visconti, and finally, the force of politics as in the case of Rosi and Petri. These essays cover a variety of Italian textual case studies and testify to a widespread critical impulse toward rethinking adaptation. To be sure, theorists on both sides of the Atlantic are in agreement in calling for new approaches to adaptation (see Andrew, Eidsvik, Kezich, Orr). Antonio Costa, one of the contributors to this volume, has recently described elsewhere the importance of concentrating on cultural institutions and technologies—the cinematographic apparatus and the literary industry as complex socio-cultural phenomena—as well as on the forms and functions of individual texts. Prima dei singoli testi sono le istituzioni, i dispositivi che entrano in rapporto e mettono in gioco le potenzialità: c'è un effetto "alone" che testi letterari e film si scambiano a vicenda, la vita di un testo si prolunga anche in trasposizioni infedeli, alio stessso modo in cui i film richiamano pubblico anche in virtù délia forza mitica di titoli e personaggi letterari famosi. Ciô non esclude comunque, che anche i confronti diretti tra i testi possano gettar luce sui processi di interazione tra cinema e letteratura. ("Comencini" 57) (Before the individual texts there are the institutions, the apparatuses that enter into contact and that put into play their potentialities: there is a "halo" effect that literary and film texts exchange in turn, the life of a text is prolonged also in unfaithful adaptations, in the same way in which films attract a public also in virtue of the mythical force of famous literary titles and characters. This does not exclude, however, that also direct comparisons between texts can shed light on the processes of interaction between cinema and literature.)</page><page sequence="6">Introduction. From Pastrone to Calvino 9 Costa's emphasis on the need to study cultural institutions in the adaptation process is an idea whose time has come. While acknowledging the continuing relevance of the direct relations that can be drawn between individual texts, Costa suggests that more attention might be fruitfully given to analyzing how the product, i.e., the film itself, functions within the larger cultural system. A new set of questions begins to emerge once fidelity to the source text is no longer the sole criterion of analysis. Film adaptations can reveal a great deal about the position and role of literary texts and genres at particular moments in history. By the same token, adaptations, as Quaresima argues in his study of Lattuada's La lupa, may actually be more revealing of the common denominators typical of the film industry during a particular era than fdms that are not based on literary works. Furthermore, in view of the diversity of examples brought together here, the essays in this volume suggest the need to develop an historical overview that would trace the role and function of film adaptations at different historical junctures: in short, which literary works have been adapted by which filmmakers at what time for what purpose and to what effect.5 Given the new approaches to this topic and the fact that adaptation is itself a phenomenon very much in evolution, as Gianfranco Bettetini has demonstrated,6 this subject will no doubt continue to engage the attention of film scholars for a long time to come. New perspectives on adaptation are only one element in the evolving debate concerning film and literature. If the ways in which national cinemas have utilized literature constitutes an integral element of film history, so too the ways in which the cinema has impacted on writers, poets, dramatists, critics, and intellectual life in general represents an equally important element of twentieth century cultural history. While the discourse on adaptation in the past has tended to privilege the literary text and to thus concentrate on literature's "influence" on film, there is also a vast amount of material, as the contributors to this volume indicate, dealing with the effect of film on literature. The force of the cinema on literature finds new meaning in Gian Piero Brunettta's essay, "La conquista dell'impero dei sogni: D'Annunzio e ^ As Lorenzo Pellizzari has recently noted in an article on the Italian cinema's use of literary sources in the last decade: "Viene subito da domandarsi se vi siano scrittori solitamente o almeno frequentemente saccheggiati dal cinema, fonte di ispirazione permanente o ricorrente per sceneggiatori e registi" (46) [The question arises immediately as to whether there are writers usually or at least frequently pillaged by the cinema, the source of permanent or recurring inspiration for screenwriters and directors]. For a useful example of a broad historical overview of adaptation in the German cinema, see Rentschler. 6 New approaches to adaptation are also being stimulated by the proliferation of written texts adapted from films. Bettetini has rightly argued that this new trend in the publishing industry, as well as the fact that many works of contemporary fiction are inspired by audiovisual models, has created the need to theorize the process of adaptation from the opposite direction (80).</page><page sequence="7">10 John P. Welle Pirandello." Analyzing the cinema's "fatal attraction" for twentieth-century Italian writers, Brunettta sets out the coordinates of a project that has wide ranging implications: Non c'è letterato tra quanti hanno avuto rapporti continuati o semplici contatti occasionali con la nascente industria cinematografica, che non sia costretto a fare i conti con una serie di problemi di etica e identità professionale, di riconoscimento di paternità e proprietà artistica, del tutto sconosciuti all'intellettuale del secolo appena trascorso. (There is no literary figure among those who have had continual relationships or simple occasional contacts with the nascent film industry who has not been forced to come to terms with a series of problems regarding ethics and professional identity, the recognition of artistic paternity and ownership, completely unknown to the intellectual of the century that had just ended.) By comparing the relationship to the cinema of two of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, D'Annunzio and Pirandello, Brunetta weaves together the separate strands of film history and literary history in order to contextualize the macrosystemic forces brought into play by the film industry. Film history and literary history, as well as their theoretical counterparts, come together in Gavriel Moses's "polyphonic" reading of Pirandello's novel,/ quaderni di Serafino Gubbio operatore. Like Giovanni Pastrone's film Cabiria (1914), for which D'Annunzio wrote intertitles, Pirandello's novel marks a watershed in the historical interactions of Italian film and literature. Exploring Pirandello's remarkable intuitions concerning the ramifications of film aesthetics, Moses argues that Pirandello's novel constitutes the prototype of an emerging narrative sub-genre: the "film-novel" in which "the epistemological and existential repercussions of [the cinema] are explored through the means of narrative." Given the massive impact of the cinema in the twentieth century, it is not surprising, Moses argues, that the novel as a genre would be stimulated to create a space for it. Moreover, because Pirandello's novel scrutinizes the cultural functions of the cinema during this period, his influence underlies not only the "film-novel" but anticipates the work of subsequent film theorists. Further theoretical considerations regarding the role of film in the cultural history of the twentieth century are provided by Antonio Costa in his essay, "Palomar e l'effetto rebound." Costa gauges the pressure of film techniques on modes of literary representation and the effects of audiovisual forms of communication on human perception. The flowering of cinematic and optic metaphors not only in literature but in disparate areas of intellectual inquiry leads Costa to analyze what he calls, following Jost, "the rebound effect," i.e. the influence of one medium upon another. Utilizing recent models of narrative theory, Costa reads Italo Calvino's Palomar as a catalogue of situations dealing with visual perception. Thus, Calvino's final novel constitutes, in Costa's view, an exemplary text for studying the relationship between the visual media and</page><page sequence="8">Introduction. From Pastrone to Calvino 11 contemporary literature. Brunetta's essay on D'Annunzio and Pirandello, Moses's theory of the fdm novel, and Costa's reading of Calvino's Palomar contribute significandy to a still largely underdeveloped area of film and literary research. Whereas in the early years of the Italian film industry literature provided a supply of ready-made stories, plots, and characters for use in cinematic adaptation (Brunetta "La migrazione"), the relations between Italian film and literature have also demonstrated a fertile cross-pollination. The fruits of this cross-pollination can be seen in numerous Italian literary texts whose authors write about films that have moved them, utilize images from the cinema that have entered into the collective imagination, adapt or reflect upon film aesthetics, and use filmic references to portray the pervasiviness of so-called mass culture. Does a "film-poem" also exist whose development parallels or perhaps runs counter to what Moses has called the film-novel? Mario Verdone's work on this question (Poemi e scenari) indicates that the origins of such a poetic sub-genre can be found in the experimentalism of the European avant-garde in Italy, France, and Russia. Verdone's reading of Futurist and other avant-garde poems with explicit filmic references represents the first phase in the development of research into what we might call the history of the film-poem. In addition to the Futurists, Italian poets as diverse as Trilussa, Umberto Saba, Delio Tessa, Eugenio Montale, Andrea Zanzotto, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Vittorio Sereni, Antonio Porta, Edoardo Sanguined, Cesare Viviani, and Valerio Magrelli, to mention only the most prominent, borrow from the cinema in the same way that poets through the ages have adapted material from the other arts in order to comment on and to criticize popular culture. Akin to such American poems as John Ashberry's "Daffy Duck in Hollywood," Frank O'Hara's "To the Film Industry in Crisis," and Robert Duncan's poem entitled "Bergman's Seventh Seal," Italian film-poems respond to such classics as Rossellini's Roma città aperta and Paisà, De Sica's Miracolo a Milano, Fellini's La dolce vita, Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, as well as films by Antonioni, Bufiuel, Bergman, Chaplin, Godard, and others.7 The evolution of cinemorphic literary texts has only recently begun to receive scholarly attention and many areas await further exploration. The essays on the evolution of cinemorphic literary texts provide excellent examples of the primacy of history in Italian film scholarship. In contrast to the frequently ahistorical character of American writing on film, Italians do not sever critical and theoretical analysis from an historical matrix. Given the historicist bent of the Italian intellectual tradition, it is not surprising that Italian scholars have long favored the analysis of literary and filmic relations within a particular historical context. Contributors to this volume testify to the ongoing vitality of 7 For some provisional conclusions regarding my own work in progress on the history of the Italian film-poem, see my essay on Zanzotto. See also De Santi.</page><page sequence="9">12 John P. Welle that tradition as they point to new questions regarding futurism, the Fascist period, neorealism, and the neorealist legacy in the decades following its zenith. Can we speak of a Futurist cinema, Mario Verdone asks in his essay "Futurismo: film e letteratura," or was the Futurist contribution mainly in the realm of aesthetics and theory? Was Futurism more important for the cinema or was the cinema more of an influence on Futurism? In reviewing the Futurist involvement with the cinema from the film Vita futurista and the Manifesto della cinematografia futurista, both of which appeared in 1916, to Marinetti's theoretical interventions and artistic activities in the late 1920s and 1930s, Verdone underlines the wide influence that key film concepts had in the development of what remains the quintessential avant-garde movement of this century. If the Fascist period saw the eclipse and co-optation of the Futurist movement with its theoretical impulse and experimental energy, it was nevertheless an important period in the development of the cinema and in the further evolution of film and literary interrelations. The presence of American film in Italian culture during this period has been the focus of a great deal of study by Italian, French, and most recently by American film scholars (see Landy, Hay, Mancini). One of the most important figures involving film and literary relationships during this period, Mario Soldati, whose novels America primo amore and 24 ore in uno studio cinematografico contain important reflections of film culture in the 1930s, is present in this volume (Morbiato) for his role in bringing three of Antonio Fogazzaro's novels to the screen in the 1940s. The historical issues broached in Morbiato's essay, described above with respect to adaptation, involve a shift in the literary models of the prewar and postwar Italian cinema. From Fogazzaro to Verga, from the calligraphism of Soldati to the anthropomorphic cinema of Visconti, this historic shift is treated in different ways by various contributors to the present volume. As is well known, the brief flowering and sudden passing of cinematic and literary neorealism during the 1940s and 1950s represents the nodal point of film and literary interrelations in Italian culture. Reflecting the prominence of neorealism in Italian film scholarship, half of the essays in this volume treat or touch on neorealism in some fashion. The debate on neorealism has evolved considerably in recent years and has moved beyond the hardened ideological positions that once placed "white telephone' ' films on one side of a line and "neorealism" on the other.8 To a greater degree than was possible just a decade ago, scholars arc now better prepared to analyze what Antonio Costa has called elsewhere "the Italian road to realism" ("La via 8 For a variety of recent Italian contributions on neorealism, see Furno and Renzi. For recent work by American film scholars on neorealism and on the career of Roberto Rossellini, see Marcus and Brunette, respectively.</page><page sequence="10">Introduction. From Pastrone to Calvino 13 italiana" 38). The essays on neorealism in this volume contribute to an on going project of historical revisionism. The significance of new historical subjects upon the stage of Italian film during the neorealist season is the focus of Angela Dalle-Vacche's essay, "Nouvelle histoire, Italian Style." Analyzing the relevance of the commedia dell'arte for theorizing neorealism, Dalle-Vacche argues that just as opera is a salient point of reference for the silent and Fascist periods, so too the commedia dell'arte functions as an important although largely unrecognized cultural referent for neorealism. Concentrating on a "certain tendency toward the bodily" in neorealist films, Dalle-Vacche argues that neorealism moves away from literary models towards the national anti-literary traditon of the commedia dell'arte. From the 1940s to the 1950s neorealism offers to Italian and to French cinema a standpoint from which to challenge the dominant formula of high budget productions associated with the Fascist epics. Dalle-Vacche concentrates on this French and Italian strain as it relates to the career of Ettore Scola and she marks its progress from his earlier works to his most recent films. Leonardo Quaresima's contribution to rethinking neorealism has already been treated within the context of adaptation. It is important to note in passing however that his reflections on the melodramatic impulse in Lattuada's La Lupa become even more poignant in light of Dalle-Vacche's focus on the commedia dell'arte. Moreover, his analysis of the neorealist star system with such popular dive as Silvana Mangano, Eleonora Rossi Drago, Sofia Loren, and Elsa Martineiii in the late 1940s and 1950s could be related to Dalle-Vacche's inquiry into the representation of the body in the neorealist cinema. The neorealist legacy as interpreted by the Taviani brothers is one of the central issues of Marcia Landy's essay, "Neorealism, Language, and Politics in the Films of the Tavianis." The continuing legacy of neorealism from the 1960s to the 1980s, both as a model and as an anti-model, is also discussed by other contributors to this volume (O'Healy, West, Bondanella, Radcliff-Umstead, Michalczyk). These essays, together with those that deal with the earlier decades of this century, demonstrate the expanding boundaries of film history, the continuing re-examination of particular historical issues, and a burgeoning interest in reflecting on the role of film studies within the academy. The increasing tendency to historicize the object of film studies has been emphasized in a recent article by Michèle Lagny who, in describing the new film history, writes: This history will be neither exhaustive, global, nor explanatory; rather, it will be at once descriptive, hypothetico-deductive and comparative—no longer "a story of origins and a memorial of grandeur" belonging to the cinema, but the questioning of the identity, the function, and the type of relations that the cinema brings to light within a society. . . . Explaining its procedures at each new step, this history would authorize freedom and imagination in order to trace the itineraries</page><page sequence="11">14 John P. Welle that would lead us from the films to the society that produces and consumes them. (17) The itineraries of the new film history, which in Lagny's terms "would lead us from the films to the society that produces and consumes them," have long been an interest of Italian scholars. To be sure, historical studies represent a particular strength of Italian film scholarship (Brunetta "La storiografia," Zavoli), and the Italian concern for history is amply evidenced in these pages. Many of the contributors to this volume successfully integrate film history and literary history within a broad theoretical framework. Given the growing interest in the United States in developing new historical approaches to the study of film (Allen and Gomery), not to mention the growth of the new historicism in literary studies, the strong historicist element in the Italian tradition beckons as a useful paradigm. Pier Paolo Pasolini in a well known essay describes the screenplay as "the concrete element in the relationship between film and literature" (187). The need to study in greater detail the role of the screenwriter, the hybrid nature of the screenplay, as well as the collaborative nature of the filmmaking process, emerges as a dominant concern in a number of the contributions to this volume. Gian Piero Brunelta's essay, discussed earlier in regard to the influence of film on literature, contains important reflections on D'Annunzio's collaboration in 1910 and 1912 with Ricciotto Canudo, the poet, novelist, art critc, dramatist, and first film aesthetician who adapted six of D'Annunzio's plays for the screen. D'Annunzio's relationship to his screenwriter is of great interest given his own less substantial but highly publicized role in collaborating with Giovanni Pastrone. In a similar fashion, Peter Bondanella deals at great length with the role of the scenario and the screenplay in his analysis of Fellini Satyricon. Aine O'Healy's discussion of Alberto Moravia's II disprezzo, a novel which grew out of Moravia's experience as a screenwriter, brings another perspective to bear on the problem. So too, many of the other essays mentioned earlier contain references to screenwriters and acknowledge the problem of the screenplay as an important element in film and literary dynamics. These issues become the central focus of Rebecca West's essay, "Tonino Guerra and the Space of the Screenwriter," in which she discusses one of the most neglected areas of film scholarship and one of the most remarkable figures in the history of Italian film and literature. Through her overview of Tonino Guerra's productive and varied career, and through her inclusion of Guerra's own remarks on his experience as a screenwriter, she brings together a number of interrelated concerns: 1) the marginality of the screenwriter, 2) the invisibility of the translator, 3) the often peripheral position occupied by the "dialect poet." She also touches on a paradox at the heart of the film/literature question: the cinema, a chiefly visual art, signals a heightened emphasis on the spoken word. West's essay is further enriched by her reflections on the Italian dialects as</page><page sequence="12">Introduction. From Pastrone to Calvino 15 potential languages of opposition and by her references to the critical problems involved in discussing dialect poetry. A fertile but problematic linguistic diversity has been one of the distinguishing features of the Italian peninsula throughout its long history. In her essay, "Neorealism, Language, and Politics in the Films of the Tavianis," Marcia Landy uncovers not only an interpretive key to the films of the Tavianis but an indigenous Italian cultural discourse: la questione della lingua. She analyzes language as a theme in the films of the Tavianis as well as the parameters of their own film language within the postneorealist context. In describing the Tavianis' attention to landscape, dialect, and cultural identity, she makes the case that their films successfully communicate Antonio Gramsci's insights into why language and culture matter to politics. Landy's treatment of the films of the Tavianis reflects the continuing importance of Gramsci's thought at the international level. Furthermore, by raising the question of language in the cinema, she also points to the deeply rooted problematics of Italian cultural politics. Within this context, the plurilinguistic levels represented in the Italian cinema, the role of the cinema and television in creating a national spoken idiom, and the difficulties in promoting Italian language films abroad can be seen as interrelated issues that need to be further integrated into the discourse on Italian film and literature.9 The relationship between film and literature has often been portrayed as a struggle between a traditional "high" culture and an emerging "popular" or "mass" culture, between a uniquely national cultural inheritance rooted in language and a transnational vocabulary of intercultural images. The Italian experience of this relationship is particularly important in light of the transformation of Italian culture in this century. Given the singular role that the cinema and television have played in that transformation, the historical interactions of Italian film and literature continue to pose questions of great moment. From this perspective, the history of film and literary interactions in Italy becomes a potential site for analyzing the changing role of intellectuals within a changing cultural context. Furthermore, while this discourse is firmly anchored in the past it also looks to the future: the study of film and literature opens up a space in which to contemplate the role of Italian culture in an increasingly global society.
