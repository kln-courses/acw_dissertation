<plain_text><page sequence="1">By RUSHTON COULBORN Civilized and Primitive Culture pT HE MOVEMENT to bring order into the study of the social sciences is growing stronger. It is perhaps a part of a still larger move- ment to bring order into the study of all the sciences- a revival of philosophy. It consists on the one hand of a return of phil- osophers to consideration of empirical data newly found by the sci- entists, and on the other of a movement of scientists towards large-scale synthesis founded upon the deepest bases of process perceptible to them. To grapple with the huge mass of new empirical knowledge philosophers are having to some extent to abdicate their claim to completeness, and even to risk consistency, permitting system to remain unachieved where apparent fact is recalcitrant. And scientists are finding it impossible to synthesize effectively within the narrow confines of the knowledge proper to special sciences as these have developed conventionally, though the problems of nuclear physics have enforced this in one area of the natural sciences, it appears to be becoming most general in the social sciences. It is, in my judgment, the beginning of the largest re-organi- zation of thought in our Western Society since the Renaissance. Two recent books illustrate respectively the two sides of this move- ment in the social sciences: Cassirer's Essay on Man' illustrates the contribution of philosophers, Kroeber's Configurations of Culture Growth2 that of scientists. Just as Henri Bergson established his philosophy largely upon a basis of new biological knowledge, so Cassirer has, although perhaps less narrowly, re-grounded his philosophy in new anthropological knowl- edge. And, if Cassirer is less narrowly anthropological than Bergson was biological, Cassirer's deeper reliance is upon biological criteria, in which he becomes related to Bergson and draws upon his work. But Cassirer's new work is in fact a re-statement of an older work of his own, or of a large part of it. It covers - in astonishingly short space3 - almost all of his Philosophie der symbolischen Formen which he wrote almost thirty years ago, but truncates, relatively speaking, his earlier contributions to the philosophy of science. The omission is significant of the compulsion upon philosophers to sacrifice completeness, while a comparison of the content of the new work and the old strikingly illus- trates the necessity for philosophers to relate their work closely to empirical data - to come down to earth. Absolutely consistent system, effected in a ruthless and voluminous logical structure, made the Philos- 274</page><page sequence="2">CIVILIZED AND PRIMITIVE CULTURE ophie der symbolischen Formen a typical product of the German schools. If the scientist was to use such work as a guide to his own method and aims and a check by an expert methodologist on his results, he had to devote a substantial study to what may be called the method of the method before he could do so; and for that as a rule he had not the time, so that a gap tended to stand between the methodologist and the operating scientist. The gap is completely closed in the Essay on Man, the philosopher dealing directly with the scientist's findings and explain- ing at once their larger implications. The center of Cassirer's thesis is, to paraphrase Plato, that man is a symbolical animal, his cultures being systems of symbols through the use of which, co-operating socially, the species makes it way in the world and in evolution. The thesis is grounded in the biological theory, here credited to Johannes Von Uexkull, (see pp. 23 et seq.) that man dif- fers from other animals by enlargement of the gap in his nervous system between the sensory and the motor mechanisms ("receptors" and "ef- fectors," Merknetz and. Wirknetz.) In this gap his brain has developed, and this is the seat of the symbolic systems of which his cultures con- sist. The common structural categories of all cultures are analyzed in Part II of the book into Myth and Religion, Language, Art, History, and Science, "History" here being used for "the place of historical knowledge in the organism of human civilization" (p. 206.) All of these cultural activities, Cassirer believes, manifest the tension between man's two propensities to preserve his social structures undamaged and therefore unchanged, and to develop and so to change them; in Art the propensity toward change is dominant. It is easy to see in this system the reflection of Plato's categories of thought, and the transformation which has ocurred is instructive. Art here corresponds with poetry in Plato's system-poetry for Cassirer plays the same part within the category of Language which art plays in culture at large - but, whereas poetry for Plato excelled in giving a certain kind of insight into the static cosmos of Greek thought, art for Cassirer is the instrumentality par excellence of change in a cosmos one of whose leading characters we now perceive to be change. Kroeber's book is equally concerned with change, but its concern is to describe accurately rather than to explain; this fundamental differ- ence between the approaches of scientist and philosopher, then, remains. Whereas, therefore, Cassirer set up a system of categories whose purpose was an explanation of how, to some extent why, culture changes, Kroeber's main aim was to demonstrate the fact that it changes. Thus Cassirer's categories were given by a purpose extraneous to the data, Kroeber's by the data themselves, and in fact only by the data he con- sidered sufficiently known empirically. Kroeber's categories are Phil- 275</page><page sequence="3">PHYLON osophy, Science, Philology, Sculpture, Painting, Drama, Literature, Music. "Growth of Nations" should perhaps also be considered as a category in Kroeber's analysis, covering both politics and social insti- tutions, although in this there would be implied a shift of the ground of categorization from culture to society, the need for which rather suggests the limits of utility of the dichotomy culture-society. But Kroe- ber's inquiry is not wholly without philosophic purpose, for it aims at dis- covering whether there are repetitive regularities as between growth in one of his categories and growth in others, whether growth in one category is successive (? causally related) to growth in another, whether there are significant approaches to average duration in time of different culture growths, whether the total growth of the culture of one people repeats roughly, closely, or not at all the total growth of culture of another people. Partial and tentative answers are returned to these questions in the last chapter of the book, and these answers are, in my opinion, of im- mense importance to social scientists and to all thinking people. Their importance is that they demonstrate empirically, without prior reliance upon any theory, that both societies considered institutionally-politically and cultures do rise and fall, and that they describe some of the patterns (Kroeber's term) in which they rise and fall. That they do rise and fall is, of course, obvious and well known. But, as Benedetto Croce has remarked, what is well known is not known. The rise and fall of cultures and societies is one of the oldest and most persistent subjects of study; I should say that it is the most persistent and also the most important subject of study in the social sciences. In recent times and in our own society it has been revived by Vico, Hegel, Bergson, Spengler, Sorokin, MacIver, and pre-eminently by Toynbee. With the exception of MacIver, however, all these inquirers have been dominated by pre- conceived theory. And all of them, including MacIver, have in under- taking these studies departed from present scientific custom; to the vast majority of contemporary social scientists the rise and fall of societies is so well known that it tends to become forgotten. Now Kroeber over a broad field, MacIver in a narrower one, have given some description of how culture and social institutions do grow and decline, as shown in the descriptive historical record. Kroeber's field is the whole of what is conventionally delimited as "history," that part of the record of man's career which is mainly in written form. But Kroeber is an anthropologist, and anthropologists have, conventionally, confined themselves largely to that part of the record which is not written, leaving the written part to the historians. Hence Kroeber's undertaking illustrates remarkably the need found by the synthesizing scientist to step outside the conventional confines of 276</page><page sequence="4">CIVILIZED AND PRIMITIVE CULTURE his science. As an anthropologist, Kroeber may be presumed to have been drawn into this undertaking for the light it would shed upon processes of change-patterns of development, he would no doubt say-in societies without writing, the primitive societies which an- thropologists customarily study. To this end Kroeber has used mainly the data found by historians, and his results therefore demonstrate effectively how two social sciences may be combined to give larger knowledge than either can give alone. It is not perhaps necessarily implied, but it is certainly suggested, by Kroeber's study that there is a distinction of type between primitive and civilized societies. In Cas- sirer's study, which deals with man's career as a whole, this distinction also tends constantly to obtrude itself, but is not faced squarely; in fact, I think there are errors and obscurities in Cassirer's thinking about it. The question of the distinction between primitive and civilized culture, or thought, will be treated below, but for reasons of space the larger questions of the transition from primitive to civilized societies will be merely mentioned. It is of importance to readers of PHYLON that a concept of race is absent from both of these books. By implication the vestigial social mean- ing of that concept tends to be almost dredged away into the concept of culture. Both of these works are, as shown in their titles, centrally concerned with culture. Culture is, of course, the master concept of anthropology. Both the breadth and depth of the insight given in the two works into the study of humanity witness to the enormous value the concept of culture has for all the social sciences and for their mean- ingful synthesis. Nevertheless we shall find below that it is necessary to draw a careful distinction between mental culture, or thought, and cultural practices which are action for some important analytical pur- poses. This may well serve as a warning. The concept culture sans terme has proved of the greatest value, but for that very reason it is most important to understand that it will not, without qualification and subdivision, serve every purpose. In Cassirer's treatment of his category Myth and Religion there are, I believe, certain misconceptions, although these are to be imputed in the first instance to the anthropological science on which Cassirer de- pends. Frazer's distinction between the sources of magic and religion is rejected (pp. 93-94), but the distinction between static and dynamic religion made by Bergson is accepted (p. 255), only Bergson's peculiar notion of the discontinuity of the two being rejected (pp. 89-90). This seems to go back to a partial reliance upon Durkheim and Levy-Bruhl for a distinction between myth, or primitive thought, and civilized thought (pp. 79 sqq). To be sure, Levy-Bruhl's view of primitive thought as "pre-logical" is rejected, but Durkheim's half-truth that myth 277</page><page sequence="5">PHYLON is modeled upon society and not upon nature is accepted and construed to justify an interpretation of primitive thought as "sympathetic": "Myth is an offspring of emotion and its emotional back- ground imbues all its productions with its own specific color. Primitive man by no means lacks the ability to grasp the em- pirical differences of things. But in his conception of nature and life all these differences are obliterated by a stronger feeling: the deep conviction of a fundamental and indelible solidarity of life that bridges over the multiplicity and variety of its single forms." (p. 82). Since for Bergson's sudden transformation a slow process of religious change of meaning is substituted, it might perhaps be justifiable to regard this statement as applying also to the religion of civilized peo- ples. I certainly think it is true of much of the philosophy of civilized peoples, but by that token it is grotesque as applied to primitive man, who is not yet concerned with such large ideas as the "solidarity of life," and hence can have no convictions about them. It is certainly no coincidence that Kroeber, seeking to base himself exclusively upon empirical data, has purposely omitted the category Religion altogether from his analysis (See his apology for this omission, pp. 799 et seq.) His category Philosophy is a narrow one, limited to formal philosophy in a definition not much better than that of a conventional text-book. Yet certainly the category includes some substance which could as well be defined as theology if not as religion. There is a real categorical distinction, of course, between theology and religion: religion is preparation for action and actual action, bridg- ing the gulf between thought and action; theology is thought. For brevity I shall simply assert that the only ultimate distinction between philosophy and theology is in a priori assumptions, and that as great differences in assumptions exist mutually between different theologies and mutually between different philosophies. It must be noticed, too, that thought or mental culture cuts across both Cassirer's and Kroeber's categories; for science is but the part of thought which is supposed, subordinately to philosophy, to deal in a classificatory way with what is exclusively empirical (but can never in fact be so narrow); art is supposed to deal with aesthetics, but is also descriptive, and is likewise subordinate to philosophy or theology, and certainly preparative of action; history (omitted from Kroeber's categories, see p. 455) is subor- dinate to philosophy, and is in the purest sense an organization of knowledge developmentally as opposed to the classificatory organization of science; and so forth. The borrowings of Cassirer from Levy-Bruhl, Durkheim, Bergson, and others, may therefore all be considered only as they apply in thought or mental culture, it being understood that this 278</page><page sequence="6">CIVILIZED AND PRIMITIVE CULTURE is a master-category controlling all the others. We may, then, proceed directly to consider the distinction between primitive and civilized thought, assuming that, whatever the distinction is, it applies in all the categories, and so affects the whole of Cassirer's synthesis, and shows the special value of Kroeber's analysis. Thus Cassirer's description of primitive thought in a manner which truly applies to civilized thought marks a failure to understand the distinction between the two, while Kroeber's omission of religion in a study of what is in reality civilized thought seems to imply that theology is not a civilized mode of thinking. The gradualness of change from myth to religion, substituted by Cassirer for the sudden transformation of Bergson, really marks, I believe, a hesitation before this question whether theological thought is truly civilized or whether it ought prop- erly to be considered as primitive. Whether gradual change is a correct description of the transition, better than Bergson's description and Frazer's, we shall shortly discover. From Levy-Bruhl onward I believe a fundamental error has been made about primitive man's thought. The error is to seek to understand that thought, as it is found existing at once in any primitive society, as a whole with internal logical relationships like those which exist within a modern science, and are supposed to exist within a systematic philosophy. The key to the error is given by a little reflection about the thought of a civilized society when that is taken as a whole at any one time. Certainly that thought is not a logical whole; taken as a whole it is not even rational. There is much belief and much behavior implying undeclared belief which is far from rational. There are indeed many systems which are internally logical, but externally they con- tradict one another, and many technical systems on which action is based are very imperfectly logical. If civilized thought is not as a whole logical, why should primitive thought be so? Why, then, is civilized thought not logical? The answer is that it has been developed at different times and in different circumstances for purposes of differ- ent kinds of action having no logical connection with one another. The same is true of primitive thought. There is, however, a real dis- tinction between primitive and civilized thought, and this is to be understood in the light of the different conditions of existence of primi- tive and civilized societies. Civilized societies, as understood here, are those great societies which arose first in the valleys of the Nile, the Tigris and Euphrates, the Indus and its then sister river the great Mihran, in the sixth or early fifth millennium B. C., and somewhat later perhaps in the valley of the Yellow River and in Crete. Most obviously those societies marked an entirely new scale of magnitude in human social organizations. The 279</page><page sequence="7">PHYLON leading characteristic of these societies and of others like them since their origin has been the process of rise and fall, integration and disin- tegration which has marked their history. I believe that the special character of their thought is intimately bound up with their rise and fall process, and with their size. Primitive societies of many sorts existed before the large civilized societies came into existence, and some sorts of primitive societies still exist in regions. to which the cultures of civilized societies have not penetrated. Cassirer, relying chiefly on Malinowski, is convinced that primitive peoples observe, that is to say, collect empirical knowledge, at least as well as civilized peoples do, and this has often been pointed out before. Reasoning upon a basis of this knowledge in primitive societies is by exactly the same methods as in civilized societies, even though the refinements of formal logic, used only for very few purposes in civilized, are unknown to primitive societies. But empirical observation is not the only basis of knowledge in any society; there is also speculative hypothesis which is used to fill gaps, otherwise impossible to fill, in empirical knowledge. (Among epistemologists endless controversies have raged as to whether or how far such hypothesis should be considered knowledge. These have served a useful purpose when they have served to redistinguish the one kind of knowledge from the other - for the distinction often becomes much confused - and have not degenerated into verbalism. But these ques- tions need not be pursued here.) Logical, or at least rational, struc- tures are used to unite and systematize knowledge of both kinds in both kinds of society. There is, for example, nothing illogical of ir- rational in viewing the universe as constructed like a human society. Every deistic view of the universe, whether held by a civilized or a primitive people, actually makes use of this assumption. It may be described as an anthropomorphic view of the universe, but so also is the view of the universe as operating in terms of cause and effect, whether applied only to that sector of the universe which man knows sensorily, or applied to the whole universe (whatever that means). These mental proceedings by analogy! or extension are anthropomorphic because there is no other way for man to proceed, but they are eminently rational and can be perfectly logical. The only difference between primitive and civilized thought in their constructions is in quantity of empirical knowledge, and hence in proportion of empirical to speculative knowledge. Primitive societies, in contact with a very small physical environment and unconcerned to enlarge that environ- ment, have a very small stock of empirical knowledge, but an appre- hension no less vivid than that of civilized societies that the known environment is continuous with a far larger physical world. The hypo- thetical construction of that world has resulted in primitive thought in 280</page><page sequence="8">CIVILIZED AND PRIMITIVE CULTURE relatively much larger speculative elements than in civilized thought. Such speculation is rational--a function of reason. Hence relatively to their respective total bodies of knowledge primitive thought is more rational than civilized thought. That is perhaps one thing that bothers us about primitive thought; we are not sufficiently rational to compre- hend it easily. Now, the comparison so far of civilized with primitive thought has dealt with the construction of new propositions; thought is constructed in the first instance in all human societies in the same way. Mental culture consists, however, at any one time of all such propositions known to a society. This also is true both of primitive and civilized societies. Let us, then, for the moment exclude civilized societies, and consider further how the various propositions have entered the culture of a primitive society, as that culture exists at any one time. They have entered it at different times and in different circumstances. They have entered it as the demands of adjustment to environment have dictated. The entire knowledge of a primitive society has entered its culture as a result of the need to know certain parts or aspects of environment in order to survive, and this is as true of speculative as of empirical knowl- edge, difficult as it may be for civilized peoples to perceive that. Primi- tive societies, in fact, exhibit man almost as close to the struggle for existence as other species are. It therefore happens that knowledge culture--itself in a primitive society becomes subject to the struggle for existence, to survival of the fittest. Once again, this applies to both kinds of knowledge, empirical and speculative, and, as a result, primitive mental culture becomes subject to a new, pragmatic process, whereby a proposition may be altered or rejected if and as action based upon it is not effective in promoting survival. Further, since different crises in a primitive society's struggle for survival occur in very different circum- stances, different parts of a primitive culture may have no logical rela- tion to one another. Thus, although all primitive culture is constructed in the first instance by a rational, even logical, process of thought, the content of the -culture at any one time is a distillation of the whole historical evolution of the society. The coherence of the whole culture is, as has constantly been emphasized by anthropologists, very strong, but it is not a logical coherence; it is a pragmatic, or instrumental, co- herence. It is grounded in the actual practices of the people, not in any theory as such. The fact is that primitive cultures, and primitive societies with them, evolve in a manner strictly analogous to the biological evolution of living organisms. A. G. Keller has remarked this process in relation to "custom,"4 as he and Sumner used that term. The term is rather too restrictive, except as applied to small social units within a civilized 281</page><page sequence="9">PHYLON society to distinguish local culture traits from the general and higher culture of the society. For primitive societies not involved in the struc- ture of a civilized society it is the whole culture, including the specula- tive, cosmological beliefs in so far as those affect practical life (as they largely do), which evolves. Knowledge, whether it be true as against the larger empirical knowledge of civilized societies or not, is subject to the test of survival of the fittest as against the lethal elements in environment. What does not confer survival value upon the people holding it is put aside and eventually forgotten. In short, a primitive society and its culture continue the evolution of species upon a new plane of existence. The new plane is described adequately in Kroeber's concept of the "superorganic":5 development continues on the social or cultural plane just as it had occurred on the physiological plane, and to a large extent takes the place of physiological evolution. In one sense, then, Levy-Bruhl was right. Primitive culture, as it exists in one society at any one time, is not at all a logical whole. Levy-Bruhl's error was in supposing that its non-logical quality ex- tended back to the thinking of primitive peoples. What, then, is dif- ferent in civilized culture? It is that much of the body of such a culture has not undergone the selective evolutionary process. Much civilized thought is what may be called free thought, built up originally by the usual rational process from empirical and speculative data, and retaining always its original character. It is indeed subject to altera- tion and correction, but correction by the same rational process by which it was originally constructed, and not by reference to any great extent to its pragmatic value in conferring survival power upon the people who hold it. But we have also noticed that the body of knowl- edge of any civilized people contains a far larger empirical element than does that of a primitive people. That is for a reason which cannot be fully explained here. The reason is, however, significantly related to the selective evolution of primitive knowledge, for it is that the earliest civilized societies (as listed above) resulted from a supreme and crucial selective test undergone by the peoples who created those societies. Those peoples met an environmental threat to their survival greater than any which humanity has met before or since, and the actual crea- tion of the large-scale civilized societies was the overcoming of the threat. It is true that the threat has recurred from time to time, though always in milder degree, and has resulted in rejuvenation of civilized societies on all such occasions, with accompanying repetition of the cultural changes which occurred concomitantly with the origin of the earliest civilized societies. After the definitive creation of the earliest civilized societies (or after the rise of new civilized societies if that concept be preferred), 282</page><page sequence="10">CIVILIZED AND PRIMITIVE CULTURE thought, and so the development of culture, have been free for the very good reason that the threat so survival had been definitively repulsed, or pushed so far into the background of the life of civilized societies as to be relatively unimportant. It is shown, then, that the relatively large body of empirical knowledge and the relative freedom of civilized thought are both due to the same characteristic events which distinguish a civilized from a primitive society. With this in mind we may return to those questions about myth and religion with which Cassirer failed to deal satisfactorily, and to Kroeber's omission of religion from his list of categories of civilized culture. Myth denotes the speculative element in primitive thought; in kind it is in no wise different from the speculative element in the theology of the "higher religions." The so-called higher religions are the religions of civilized societies, and those of the earliest civilized societies compounded their theologies exclusively from the knowledge of primitive societies. For later civilized societies or later revivals of civilized societies theology was drawn in part (and in part only) from the cultural debris of earlier civilized societies. This difference is, however, unimportant, for the theology, including the cosmogony, the ethic, and all other elements whatsoever, of every higher religion has been formed under the special environmental stress through which civilized societies come into existence. This is what is referred to above as the supreme selective test undergone by the peoples who created civilized societies. The test is the same in kind as that to which primitive peoples, their cultures and their societies are con- stantly and, in many cases, unremittingly subjected. It is different only in magnitude and concentration in time. If there is a difference, then, between primitive myth and civilized theology, it is one propor- tional to the different operation of the process of natural selection. Cassirer's substitution of gradual change from myth to religion for Bergson's sudden transformation is therefore poor doctrine. The actual particulars of Bergson's argument are fantastic in their resort to a metaphysic of vital force (elan vital), etc.; and the idea of suddenness or discontinuity is incorrect also. Yet Bergson's doctrine succeeds in reflecting the fact that the tempo of operation of natural selection upon the formation of a civilized religion is far rapider, its impact far heavier, than is the case with a primitive culture (or cult). I think it must be pronounced truer than Cassirer's gradualness, which reflects an extreme Darwinistic view of evolutionary processes now largely abandoned. But neither Cassirer's nor Bergson's doctrine is ultimately satisfactory. Kroeber's analysis of civilized culture is essentially of mental culture, which is to say, thought. It is not surprising, then, that he could not find a way of treating religion similarly; it is a tribute to the soundness of his empirical procedure that he could not do so. He notices in effect 283</page><page sequence="11">that theology grows (p. 800), and he would have done best to include theology with philosophy as a single category, for much which is cus- tomarily called theology did slip into his category of philosophy anyway. Religion in its aspect as action does not grow in a civilized society once the society has passed the crucial juncture of its formation under com- pulsion of natural selection. On the contrary, it is notorious that it gradually declines. What happens is that the freely functioning civilized mind assigns the activities of the society for the most part to direction by other categories of thought; if theology still grows, it is only as a particular attitude in philosophy. Is the conclusion, then, that religion is essentially primitive in character, and has no place in a civilized society? I think not. The formation of a "higher religion" is the essen- tial means whereby a civilized society comes into existence. This pro- cess is essentially like the process by which primitive cultures develop, but its operation at the origin of a civilized society is in fact more vehement and rapid than during the development of a primitive culture and society. Hence to describe this process as primitive would be at least a verbal error. Cassirer's general conclusion that all the categories of culture mani- fest the tension between man's two propensities, to preserve his social structures unchanged, and to develop and so to change them, is thus true, but much too general and unenlightening. It may be true that art is par excellence the mode of promoting change in a civilized society, but, if so, this is a secondary matter. Much more important is it that all thought in a civilized culture, however categorized, seeks develop- ment; it also preserves past achievement, but seeks always to transcend it, and is therefore aimed at change ordered by rational, logical control. Thought in a primitive society has the same aim, but in effect thought is intermittent, even rare, in a primitive society. It is in a primitive society that we see most clearly that it is ultimately nature external to man, operating through natural selection, which tends to preserve man's social structures unchanged. Man, if left to himself, would per- haps favor only development. The tension manifested in man's cultural activities, therefore, is in the last analysis a tension between man and nature external to him. In seeking to understand this tension, it thus becomes essential to distinguish sharply between the cultural status- which is really an aspect of the biological status - of civilized man and that of primitive man. If, however, civilized man has won a new fran- chise for his propensity to development, it is not an absolute franchise: his "higher religions" sum up, as it were, the lessons taught him by natural selection in his primitive status. Whether operating as religion directly upon his actions, or as theology upon his thought, these "les- sons" restrain him from chaotic innovation, or they tend to do so. 284 PHYLON</page><page sequence="12">CIVILIZED AND PRIMITIVE CULTURE 285 Theology, through its unity with philosophy, is the real source of tradi- tion as found in all categories of a civilized culture, and civilized man knows that he must preserve his cultural traditions even in transcending them; he must not jettison them frivolously. And yet how well has civilized man understood this profound truth, this biologically-culturally sanctioned truth? This question raises a host of other questions, which are in fact almost the same question in other terms. Thus, is it necessary or unnecessary to the growth of a civilized culture that religion should decline? Even, is it good or bad, biological- ly-culturally speaking, that religion should decline? If, as the historical record shows, religion always has declined in civilized societies, is it possible to imagine a civilized society in which religions should not de- cline? These questions are beyond the scope of this essay. We are not, however, without some knowledge from which as basis to set out to seek answers to them. They are in the social sciences the sort of questions which may find answers in that revival of philosophy which was noticed at the outset of this essay. That they arise in a critical con- sideration of Kroeber's and Cassirer's books witnesses to the great im- portance for scholarship of those two books. REFERENCES 1.
