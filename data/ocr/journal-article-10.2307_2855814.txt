Edited with notes on the sources by F'rancesco del Punta, translated into English with explanatory notes by Marilyn McCord Adams. (Classical and Medieval Logic Texts, 1.) Oxford, England, and New York: Oxford University Press, for the British Academy, 1978. Pp. xvi, 294. $37.50. BOETHIUS, De topicis differentiis. Translated, with notes and essays on the text, by Eleonore Stump. Ithaca, N.Y., and London: Cornell University Press, 1978. Pp. 288. $18.50. PAUL OF VENICE (t 1429) was one of the most renowned Italian logicians, and his Logica Magna is, perhaps, the most voluminous work ever written on logic. In modern print it would be equivalent to approximately 2,500 octavo pages. It survives in one manuscript (Vat. lat. 2132) and two editions (Venice 1499 and 1559), of which the second seems to be simply a reprint of the first. Part I, Treatise 1, "On Terms," edited and translated by N. Kretzmann, will appear in a forthcoming fascicle of the British Academy's Classical and Medieval Logic Texts. Part I, Treatise 2, "On Supposition," was edited and translated by A. P. Perreiah (Paul of Venice, Logica Magna. Tractatus de Suppositionibus. F'ranciscan Insti- tute Publications, Text Series 15 [St. Bonaventure, N. Y., 1971]). The present work is an edition and translation of Part II, Treatises 10 and 11. A more desirable proce- dure would have been to start the edition and translation with Part I, Treatise 1, and</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 615 proceed from there because Paul of Venice in the later parts of his work presupposes everything he taught before. This defect has been supplied in part by numerous references to other parts of the Logica Magna. Paul of Venice studied in Oxford and became thoroughly familiar with the teach- ings of the English logicians of the second half of the fourteenth century. One of the reasons his voluminous work is worth studying is that he cites the teachings of many other authors, some of whom would otherwise remain completely unknown. In the two treatises edited here, Paul recites and discusses no less than eleven opinions. The authors of some of these were known to Karl Prantl, more than a hundred years ago. Others are identified by del Punta, who publishes the pertinent tracts of Richard Feribrigge and of John Venator in Appendices I and II (pp. 215-251). The authors of two more opinions quoted and discussed in "On the Significatum of a Proposition" (pp. 80-84) may now be identified since some of the same views were cited by the Franciscan Richard Brinkley in his Summa Logicae (written circa 1370 and preserved in MS Prague, Stitni Knihovna CSR, II. A. 11). In chapter 69 of his Summa Logicae, Brinkley analyzed three opinions. The first is attributed in the margin to Richard of Billingham; the second to a certain "Berriman," presumably William of Birmingham; and the third, called multum famosa, to Richard Feribrigge. The first and second opinions analyzed in Brinkley are the same as the first and second opinions criticized by Paul of Venice and may be attributed to Billingham and Birmingham respectively. A short treatise by Billingham, De significato propositionis, is known, but I am not aware of any surviving work by Birmingham. The Latin text, although it is based on one manuscript only and on one edition, seems to be reliable and carefully edited. Here and there, I would have been reluctant to dismiss the reading of the manuscript in favor of the reading of the edition, e.g., on p. 28, 1. 19; p. 54, 1. 29; p. 70, 1. 8; p. 164, 11. 14, 27. The translator had to tackle a very difficult task. Paul of Venice did not write the plain, easy, narrative Latin of the thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century authors. He used a highly sophisticated - and sometimes deliberately complicated - lan- guage, developed mostly by the English logicians in the second half of the fourteenth century. It is the kind of Latin that was an abomination to the humanists. The two treatises here edited and translated are full of intentional ambiguities, and translating ambiguities of one language into another is as difficult as translating puns. For instance, the sentence on p. 26, 11. 32-33: "Aliquod praecise sicut est significans est A prospositio falsa," which is translated: "Something (that is) precisely (of) the way it is a sign is A a false proposition." If Dr. Adams intended to preserve the ambiguity of the Latin phrase, she certainly succeeded. She is an expert logician, eminently well trained in symbolic logic; therefore she considered it more important to do justice - as far as possible - to the logical technicalities of Paul of Venice than to write elegant English prose. Putting aside minor objections, I find it difficult to agree with translating "est significans" as "is a sign" and "intelligere" as "to think." This is done with few exceptions throughout the whole volume; therefore I presume it was done intention- ally, after mature consideration. Yet, "intelligere" means "to understand," "cogitare" means "to think." The two are not synonymous. To think is a process, which may or may not lead to clear understanding, and we can think of many things we shall never understand. Besides, to attribute thinking to God, as sometimes is done in this translation, contrasts with the common teaching of the scholastic authors. For apart from a few anthropomorphic expressions in the Bible, God does not think. He understands and knows everything without thinking; His one and simple essence is</page><page sequence="3">616 Reviews His all-embracing understanding. Concerning "significans" and "to be a sign," Paul of Venice would deny that "signifying" and "to be a sign" are interchangeable, because for him a written proposition in a closed book is a sign of something but it does not signify unless it is related to a mind which is capable of understanding it. Despite these reservations, students of medieval logic will find that Adams and del Punta have made an important contribution to the field in this volume. The transla- tion will undoubtedly be a great help to those whose proficiency in Latin is limited, particularly since the Latin text is printed on the facing page for ready reference. Indeed, every effort has been made to assist the reader. The explanatory notes discuss problems of translation and certain logical problems peculiar to Paul of Venice. There are also useful references to other scholastic authors. In addition, the reader might find it helpful to compare Paul of Venice's conclusions on the truth of a proposition with the five lucid rules given by Pseudo John Duns Scotus in his Quaestiones in librum Priorum Analyticorum Aristotelis (ed. L. Wadding, in Scotus, Opera Omnia, 1 [Lyons, 1639], 277 ff.). Boethius (t525) is rightly called the tutor of the Middle Ages, because he was the writer who exercised the most lasting influence on the logicians of the scholastic period. Through his translations and commentaries he made a great part of Aris- tole's logic available to the western world. His works on logic became obligatory textbooks from the twelfth to the sixteenth century. In De topicis differentiis, translated and commented on by Eleonore Stump, Boethius teaches the method of finding arguments for conclusions which are neither self- evident nor follow from self-evident propositions. This is the first translation of this important work into any modern language, and it is illustrated with abundant notes. Ancient philosophical texts are always difficult to translate, because they are full of terms whose meaning varies according to the context and the intention of the author. F'or instance, the word "ratio," used countless times by Boethius, can stand for as many as twenty more or less different concepts. It is not easy to decide in all cases which of them the author may have had in mind. Should another English translation appear in print, it would be interesting to compare the two translations and count the differences. Without intending to detract from Stump's accomplishment, I wish to mention a few disagreements. I do not think it was necessary or even useful to translate "probabile" with "readily believable." The word "probable" may be misleading. But "believable" also can be misleading since, because of its association with "belief" and "faith," it may suggest that Boethius is speaking here about propositions accepted on authority, without rational foundation. One of the definitions of faith given by Webster is "firm belief in something for which there is no proof." If "probabile" is not to be translated as "probable," I would prefer to use "generally admitted" which agrees more closely with the Greek term Boethius is translating. I have similar reservations about rendering "fides," so dear to Boethius, by "belief." On p. 30, 11. 22-23 (and repeatedly thereafter), the definition of argument, "Ar- gumentum est ratio rei dubiae faciens fidem," is translated by "An argument is a reason (ratio) producing belief regarding a matter [that is] in doubt." "Belief" is only one of the several possible meanings of "fides." In expressions like "fidem facit," "fidem supplet," "fidem tribuit," it can mean "guarantee," "certainty," "assurance," "security," "to pledge," "to vouch for," etc. Hence, the definition of argument could be translated by "an argument is a reason which guarantees the solution of a question," or "which provides certainty when we are in doubt," or "which settles a question."</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 617 Here and there I noticed a few sentences which seemed to be either too literal or less than adequate translations. For example, when Boethius speaks of propositions which can be demonstrated, he says "quae ut demonstrari valeant, non recusant." This is rendered on p. 33, 11. 23-24, by "which do not deny that they can be demonstrated." My suggestion: "which are susceptible of demonstration" or "which do not defy demonstration." On p. 33, 11. 26-27, the words "Quae propositiones cum fidem sui natura propriam gerant" are translated by "Since these propositions pro- duce appropriate belief in themselves by nature." My suggestion: "Since such is the nature of these propositions that they vouch for their own truthfulness." Boethius, speaking of the importance of the study of the topics, says, "quae in artem redigit vim et potestatem naturae," which on p. 42,11. 35-36, is translated by "which brings force to art and power to nature." My suggestion: "which refines into an art the acumen and ability given us by nature." Boethius says of the maximal propositions or Topics, "et per eas fit consequens et rata conclusio," which is translated on p. 47, 11. 31-33: "and by means of them the consequent arises and the conclusion becomes ratified." My suggestion: "and by means of them the conclusion becomes consequent and valid." "Consequens" is an adjective of "conclusio" as well as "rata." On p. 51, 1. 10, "a communiter accidentibus" is translated by "from associated accidents." My sugges- tion: "from what generally happens." There is a meaningless line in the Latin original: "eos namque qui vident, alios etiam caecos esse contingit." On p. 56, 11. 14-15, it is translated: "for it happens that there are those who see and others who are blind." The word "alios" is a printing mistake for "alias." Hence, the translation should be: "for those who see, some other time may be blind." The translation is followed by an abundance of explanatory notes (pp. 97-155). In the second part (pp. 159-261), Stump discusses the place and uses of topics in Aristotle's dialectic; the changes in the notion of a topic between Aristotle and Boethius; the contribution of Boethius in his De topicis differentiis; the topics inter- preted and applied by Peter of Spain and other medieval logicians; and, finally, the relation of the topics and their differentiae to Aristotle's categories and to Porphyry's predicables. Dr. Stump has made an important and much needed contribution to the history and understanding of medieval logic. GEDEON GAL St. Bonaventure University</page></plain_text>
