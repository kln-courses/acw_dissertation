<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hcabit antd instinct. By C. LLOYD MORGAN, F.G.S., author of Animal Life and intelligence, Psychology Jor Teachlers, etc. London and New York: Edward Arnold, 1896. Pp. 351. INTIMATE acquairntance with the ways of animals, sobriety of judg- ment, a natural aptitude for psychological analysis, and unfailing lucidity, both of thought and expression, form the characteristic merits of Mr. Lloyd Morgan's work. No other writer on Animal Psychology with whom we are acquainted combines these qualities in so high a degree. One of them, however, is perhaps pushed to excess. His love of lucidity sometimes leads Mr. Morgan to simplify overmuch. As an example of what we take to be undue simplification, we may refer to the chapter on " Consciousness and Instinct ". The leading idea of this chapter is that the instinctive movements which follow in response to an appropriate stimulus owe their determinate character to connate physiological arrangements. They are therefore not to be regarded as psychological facts. On the other hand, the various peripheral impressions due to the changing states of the muscles, etc., and the changing relations to external objects, produce corresponding modifications of con- sciousness in the way of sensations. When the action is repeated under similar conditions on a subsequent occasion, the residua of these bygone sensations may be revived by association, and modify the behaviour of the animal. The sight of a caterpillar promiipts a</page><page sequence="2">C.

But it may happen that the caterpillar turns out to be distasteful, so that the chicken ejects it instead of swallow- ing it. When, on a subsequent occasion, it catches sight of a caterpillar with similar markings, the previous sensation of disgust is reinstated by association, and the chicken, in consequence, re- frains from pecking, or, if it pecks at all, it pecks in a cautious and tentative manner. Now there is one side of this doctrine which we at once acknowledge to be true and instructive. The definite nature of the instinctive movements is in the first instance due purely to physiological conditions, and it is the experience gained in the course of them which serves to guide subsequent action. The connate instinct is in fact a means supplied by nature for the education of the animal. It is when we come to Mr. Lloyd Morgan's account of the precise manner in which subsequent be- haviour is modified by previous experience, that we find ourselves unable to agree with him. We disagree with him for two reasons, both because we believe his assumptions to be insufficient to account for the facts, and also because we believe his assumptions to be in themselves unjustifiable. Our space only allows us to make a brief reference to the first point. Mr. Morgan's assump- tions are not sufficient to account for the facts. They ca.n only appear so by the surreptitious introduction of an anthropomorphic point of view. Evidently, when Mr. Lloyd Morgan speaks of the revived sensation of disgust, he is thinking of the chicken as having in its little head an idea of a future event apprehended as standing in a certain relation of sequence to a present experience, on condi- tion that a certain other event takes place, viz., the act of pecking. This certainly would account for the facts, and for a great deal more than the facts. But we must remember that the bare revival of an experience cannot be or contain more than the original ex- perience itself. Now all that Mr. Lloyd Morgan has to work with is bare revival or repetition; and the original experiences which are supposed to be revived or repeated are mere crude or isolated sen- sations, without any kind of meaning. They are not even linked together by a continuous conation; they are certainly very far in- deed from being perceptions of things or qualities or their relations. Each crude sensation originally produces a certain movem3nt in a reflex way. When a number of sensations are brought together by association, each will tend to produce its own movement, just as it did before. So far as the movements are incompatible, they will partly neutralise each other. I do not see what other result this could possibly have except chaotic confusion. Certainly, the result could not be the intelligent guidance of behaviour in relation to an end. But this is precisely what the facts show us. It is impossible, for instance, to see how in this way a spider should come to test by trial the stability of its web, before being satisfied to leave it. It is impossible to see how a chicken should come to</page><page sequence="3">266 CRITICAL NOTICES: make a tentative peck at a suspicious caterpillar just to see what it is like before swallowing it. In fact, Mr. Lloyd Morgan's view is exposed to all the objections which have been brought against the attempt to build mind out of the isolated atoms of sensation. It would carry us too far to attempt to state the solution of the problem which we would substitute for Mr. Lloyd Morgan's. We may say, however, that we think he would have treated the question on right lines if he had constantly kept in mind and followed up in detail the position which he states on page 156. Here he lays stress on the instinctive impulse. "Impulse is the tendency of any organism to satisfy its needs and fulfil the conditions of its being." " At the touch of experience" these needs "are modified or further defined. . . . When new stimuli come there is an impulsive tendency to realise, not the old being . . . but a new being, in what that which was due to inheritance is modified by that which has been acquired by individual experi- ence." This is a fundamentally different account of the matter, though the author does not appear to see the difference. Of course in any case association and revival are involved in the pro- ce.ss; but association and revival may assume many very different forms, and the real question is, what sort of association and revival are operative in this primitive learning by experience? We have dwelt on this point both because of its importance and because it is the only part of Mr. Lloyd Morgan's work to which we are inclined to take exception. The book as a whole deserves almost unqualified praise. The early chapters, dealing with the author's experiments and observations, are full of interesting matter. The chapter on "Imitation" begins with a useful distinc- tion between imitation proper and copying. The treatment of this topic is on the whole excellent, and brings into clear light the nature of social tradition among animals, and its importance for their mental development. The chapter on " Emotions" is very clear, but we think that Mr. Lloyd Morgan has been somewhat rash in his wholesale acceptance of James' theory of emotion,- a theory which, in its extreme form at least, has ceased to be held by its author. The general organic disturbance must originate in general nervous disturbance, and what can the psychical correlate of this be if it is not emotional ? Special chapters are devoted to the " Habits and Instincts of the Pairing Season," and to " Nest- building, Incubation, and Migration ". We miss, however, a chapter on the Play of Animals, a most important topic, which has been recently dealt with in a most instructive manner by Karl Groos in his book on Die Spiele der Thiere. The concluding chapters are mainly devoted to biological prob-- lems. Mr. Lloyd Morgan rejects the doctrine of the transmission of individually acquired modifications, or, at any rate, he regards it as too dubious even for a working hypothesis. On the other hand, he strongly supports the view that individual power of varying in accordance with varying conditions gives natural selection time to</page><page sequence="4">C.

This, theory, which is certainly very luminous and convincing, appears to have originated almost simultaneously in more than one mind. Among these, Prof. Baldwin is perhaps the most prominent. I do not know whether Mr. Lloyd Morgan has also a claim to origi- nality in the matter, but his exposition is certainly very able. It should be said in conclusion that the book is in Mr. Lloyd Morgan's best style, and that it is delightful reading for everybody,. as well as indispensable reading for specialists.
