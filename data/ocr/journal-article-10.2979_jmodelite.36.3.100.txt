<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Dogging the Subject: Samuel Beckett,  Emmanuel Levinas, and Posthumanist Ethics Karalyn Kendall-Morwick Indiana University Bloomington This article examines the figure of the dog in Samuel Beckett’s fiction and Emmanuel  Levinas’s philosophy, demonstrating dogs’ special capacity to confound humanist subject  formation. Scholars have noted how Beckett’s depictions of animal suffering collapse the  Cartesian distinction between the human as rational animal and the animal as living  machine, yet for Beckett and Levinas, the dog does not merely represent “the animal”  in this generic sense. Analysis of human/dog encounters in Beckett’s Watt and Molloy  and Levinas’s essay “The Name of a Dog” reveals dogs’ paradoxical position within what  Derrida deems the sacrificial structure of Western humanism. As animals, dogs define  through negation the humanist subject, yet their participation in systematized violence  against other animals complicates humanism’s ethical quandary vis-à-vis “the animal.”  Through the dog, Beckett and (more reluctantly) Levinas expose the need for a posthu- manist ethics that abandons the myth of rational autonomy and responds to animals in  their radical alterity and heterogeneity. Keywords: Samuel Beckett / Emmanuel Levinas / posthumanism  / ethics  /  animals The late-modernist fiction of Samuel Beckett figures the human as having a tenuous grasp on its species identity — as “[clinging] on to . . . the human,” in the words of one narrator (How 47). This theme, visible in Beckett’s early  work, comes to the forefront in the novels written in the wake of the dehuman- izing atrocities of World War II. The eponymous protagonist of Watt is “troubled  . . . by this indefinable thing that prevented him from saying, with conviction, and  to his relief, of the object that was so like a pot, that it was a pot, and of the crea- ture that still in spite of everything presented a large number of exclusively human  characteristics, that it was a man” (82–83). As the pun on Watt/What indicates,  the ontological status of the human is a central concern in this and subsequent  novels — especially the trilogy of Molloy, Malone Dies, and The Unnamable, whose  narrators, Paul Sheehan notes, share a “relationship with their species [that] is  provisional and under constant renegotiation” (“Zoomorphism” 663). Molloy, for  instance, “abandon[s]” the “erect motion . . . of man” in the course of his narrative  </page> <page sequence="2"> Dogging the Subject 101 and makes only qualified assertions about his species identity: “I am human, I  fancy . . .” (Three 89, 78). Beckett’s work has thus been invoked in recent debates concerning the demise  or persistence of humanism. Richard Begam reads the trilogy as mapping a “shift  from a humanist discourse, centred on man, to an antihumanist discourse, centred  on language” (302). Conversely, Gilbert Yeoh insists that Beckett’s work affirms  humanism by conveying the “genuine despair of human subjects overwhelmed by  the growing darkness, obscurity and impenetrability that result from the prolif- erating negative textuality” (115). Jonathan Boulter deems Beckett’s stance post- humanist, but adds that “the persistence of the human even in its most denuded  form .  .  . essentially collapses the opposition ‘human-posthuman’ ” (15). The  slippage between “posthumanist” and “posthuman” in Boulter’s analysis warrants  attention, as theorists like Cary Wolfe hold that posthumanism “isn’t posthuman  at all — in the sense of being ‘after’ our embodiment has been transcended — but  is only posthumanist, in the sense that it opposes [humanist] fantasies of disem- bodiment and autonomy” (What xv). Indeed, particularly perplexing for Beckett’s  human is the fact that he remains recognizable as such.1 Despite his “loss of spe- cies,” he exhibits reason, free will, and language, making him “all too human” in  the words of Moran, the detective who narrates the second half of Molloy (Watt  85, Three 107). Sheehan thus characterizes Beckett’s stance as an “apostasised  humanism” that “reopens the possibility of value renewal” within the category of  the human while rejecting the “overconfident critical orthodoxy” of the humanist  tradition (Modernism 184). Until recently, despite rigorously examining Beckett’s relationship to human- ism, scholars have paid scant attention to the presence of animals in Beckett’s  oeuvre — a notable omission considering the centrality of the human/animal  binary to humanist delineations of the subject by thinkers as diverse as Aristotle,  Descartes, Kant, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas. Early studies tended to read  Beckett’s animals as metaphors for the dehumanized modern subject, but a num- ber of critics have begun to take seriously Beckett’s interest in animals as such.2  Shane Weller notes that Beckett repeatedly presents animals “as suffering beings,”  collapsing “the strict Cartesian distinction between human and animal” (214,  216). Martin Puchner similarly contends that Beckett blurs the human/animal  boundary through a “decentering of the human” (21). Puchner situates Beckett’s  animals within debates about animal rights, a perspective that Wolfe critiques as  “essentially humanist” in its goal of extending a more or less Kantian subjectivity  to animals, “thus effacing the very difference of the animal other that it sought  to respect” (Animal 8). In contrast, Weller argues that Beckett’s insistence on  animals’ radical alterity — even as he troubles the Cartesian binary — precludes  a simplistic response to animal suffering. Beckett’s stance, he proposes, is best  understood as “anethical”: “a double movement both towards and away from any  ethical position” (219). We can start to make sense of this apparent ambivalence by examining how  Beckett troubles not just the human/animal distinction, but the very idea of “the  </page> <page sequence="3"> 102 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 animal.” Derrida takes this concept to task in The Animal That Therefore I Am,  denouncing the “asinanity” (31) — translator David Wills’s approximation of Der- rida’s “bêtise” — of grouping “every living thing that is held not to be human” into  a single category without regard for “the infinite space that separates the lizard  from the dog, the protozoon from the dolphin, the shark from the lamb,” and so  on (34). Beckett’s resistance to this homogenizing gesture is particularly evident  in his representations of dogs. Of the nonhuman inhabitants of the Beckettian  landscape, dogs are the most conspicuous and, arguably, the most resistant to  emblematization. While their mangy bodies and grotesque sexuality have led  critics to regard them as symbols of degraded humanity, they rarely elicit feel- ings of disapproval or even pity from Beckett’s protagonists; more often, they  inspire envy or fascination.3 As Steven Connor notes of two scenes in Molloy,  the canine encounter “arouses a powerful sense of otherness” that prompts Mol- loy and Moran “to suspend the fractious scepticism of their narratives and forget  themselves in consoling reverie” (30).4 Further, Beckett’s humans and dogs are  inextricably linked by an interspecies legacy that, Donna Haraway reminds us,  “is not especially nice; it is full of waste, cruelty, indifference, ignorance, and  loss, as well as of joy, invention, labor, intelligence, and play” (Companion 12).  Perhaps counterintuitively, it is via the familiar and often darkly comic figure of  the dog that Beckett expresses most forcefully the problem of animal alterity for  humanist ethics. Dogs’ capacity to perforate the borders of the human is also evident in the  work of Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, whose ethics of alterity shares a  complex relationship with the humanist/antihumanist debate in which Beckett’s  work engages. By positing alterity as the basis for ethical subjectivity, Derrida  notes, Levinas breaks with “a certain traditional humanism” that regards rational- ity and autonomy as essential attributes of the subject (“Eating” 279). His rejection  of such criteria would seem to remove the obstacles that have barred animals from  ethical subjectivity, yet Levinas maintains that the other who calls the subject  into ethical relations can only be another human. Derrida thus dubs Levinasian  ethics a “profound humanism” that excludes animals from moral consideration by  drawing the boundaries of subjectivity at the borders of the human (279). A canine  encounter, though, tempts Levinas to extend ethics beyond the species divide. In  “The Name of a Dog, or Natural Rights,” he describes a dog who wandered into  the Nazi camp where he was imprisoned during World War II. Bobby, Levinas  recalls, “would appear at morning assembly and was waiting for us as we returned,  jumping up and down and barking in delight. For him, there was no doubt that  we were men” (153). Bobby’s welcome is so compelling that Levinas dubs him “the  last Kantian in Nazi Germany” (153). Despite the ironic disavowal implicit in this  statement, Levinas’s attribution of something like subjectivity to Bobby indicates  just how powerfully dogs confound humanist subject formation. In what follows, I examine the destabilizing presence of dogs in Beckett’s  late-modernist fiction — especially Watt and Molloy — and Levinas’s neohuman- ist philosophy in order to outline the ontological and ethical challenge posed by  </page> <page sequence="4"> Dogging the Subject 103 animal alterity in the aftermath of World War II. Beckett and Levinas both locate  the dog in a paradoxical position within what Derrida deems the “sacrificial struc- ture” of Western humanism, wherein the animal is excluded from subjectivity  through discursive and literal sacrifice (“Eating” 278). The dog, as animal, belongs  to a realm of abjection that defines through negation the humanist subject; yet,  as Beckett and Levinas insinuate, dogs occupy a quasi-subjective status by virtue  of their coevolutionary relationship with humans. As humans’ longtime hunt- ing and herding partners whose labor facilitated the rise of hunter/gatherer and  agricultural societies, dogs are co-implicated in the subjugation and sacrifice of  other animals, complicating the ethical quandary in which Western humanism  finds itself vis-à-vis the animal. While the human’s loss of species in Beckett’s  fiction evokes both the unspeakable horrors of World War II and the destructive  and alienating forces of modernity, the canine encounter, as Beckett and (more  reluctantly) Levinas indicate, precipitates a more radical, primary confrontation  with the sacrificial logic of post-Enlightenment humanism. In order to illuminate dogs’ privileged role in Beckett’s reconfiguration of the  human/animal relationship, I first examine how the simultaneously subjugated  and elevated status of the Beckettian dog complicates the problem of animal  suffering for humanist ethics. I then turn to Levinas’s essay on Bobby to demon- strate how humanist formulations of the subject persistently falter in the canine  encounter. Finally, I link dogs’ destabilizing power to their vital role in facilitat- ing human violence against other animals, illustrating how Beckett and Levinas  co-implicate humans and dogs in the crimes against animality epitomized by the  modern slaughterhouse. The interconnected motifs of caninicity and slaughter in  the Beckettian landscape thus signal dogs’ special capacity to disrupt humanist  configurations of the subject. Throughout, I reveal how Beckett’s dogs, like Levi- nas’s Bobby, mutely articulate the need for a posthumanist ethics that recuperates  and respects the radical alterity subsumed under the category of “the animal.” A Dog’s Life The persistence with which Beckett portrays animals in states of suffering makes  it difficult to dismiss them as mere symbols of human futility or degradation.  As Weller observes, one of the primary ways Beckett undermines the human/ animal divide is by depicting animals experiencing suffering and “human beings  expressing sympathy for that suffering” (although Beckett’s refusal to efface alter- ity means that he remains skeptical as to “whether or not the attempt to alleviate  the suffering of an animal is in fact an unambiguously ethical action” — a question  to which I will return) (214). Belacqua in the early story “Dante and the Lobster”  is troubled by the routine suffering of animals. He spots a downed horse with a  man sitting on its head and acknowledges “that that is considered the right thing  to do. But why?” (More 20). Later, he watches in horror as his aunt prepares to  boil the eponymous lobster. Her insistence that lobsters “feel nothing” echoes  the Cartesian view of animals as automata (22). For Descartes, “pain exists only  </page> <page sequence="5"> 104 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 in the understanding,” so animals, though they may exhibit “the external move- ments which accompany this feeling in us,” cannot experience “pain in the strict  sense” because they lack reason (“To Mersenne” 148). Belacqua tries to reassure  himself that “it’s a quick death,” but the narrator’s retort — “It is not” — undercuts  the Cartesian distinction between the human as rational animal and the animal  as living machine (22). To the extent that Beckett represents animals as suffer- ing beings, and that his characters’ sympathy for their suffering indicates that it  warrants ethical consideration, Beckett (like Derrida) appears to endorse Jeremy  Bentham’s oft-quoted formulation: “[T]he question is not, Can they reason? nor,  Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?” (283n).5 Yet Beckett’s blurring of the Cartesian divide neither negates alterity nor  translates into a straightforward call to eliminate suffering in the name of  animal rights or a utilitarian maximization of happiness. An autobiographical  fragment from his late novella Company illustrates the danger of naïve attempts  to assign rights or alleviate suffering. A boy “take[s] pity on a hedgehog out in  the cold and put[s] it in an old hatbox with some worms,” eventually reopening  the box to discover the gruesome results of his “good deed” (Nohow 20): “The  mush. The stench” (22).6 Weller references this passage to show that, for Beck- ett, “the alterity of the animal means that any human intervention is liable to  be catastrophic” (214–15). Yet as Belacqua’s response to the downed horse sug- gests, animal suffering assumes multiple forms, complicating the questions of  whether and how the human should respond. In the case of a non-domesticated  animal like the hedgehog, intervention seems ill advised, especially when the  animal’s perceived distress is an anthropomorphic projection. By contrast,  Beckett presents the suffering of equines as unjust when it results from their  use as means to human ends. In Malone Dies, for example, Lambert rescues an  old mule from slaughter, but only because he hopes to “screw” more labor out  of him (Three 212). Equine suffering typically elicits genuine sympathy from  Beckett’s protagonists, such as when Molloy sees a man whipping a team of  donkeys: “My eyes caught a donkey’s eyes, they fell to his little feet, their brave  fastidious tread” (26).7 Even among domesticated animals, suffering — and consequently its ethical  import — is not a uniform phenomenon. While equines suffer as draft animals,  Beckett’s dogs suffer in their seemingly elevated status as humans’ companions.  The most obvious figures of canine suffering in Beckett’s oeuvre are the famished  dogs of Watt. While employed as a servant to the mysterious Mr Knott, Watt  is instructed to give leftover food to the dog — a puzzling order because there is  no dog to be found. So begins Watt’s lengthy exposition of a convoluted system  for uniting Mr Knott’s leftovers with a dog hungry enough to ensure that “not  an atom remained” (95). The resulting arrangement involves the employment of  the five-generation Lynch family to maintain a “colony of famished dogs set up  by Mr Knott in order that there should never be wanting a famished dog to eat  his food on those days that he did not eat it himself ” (100). The famished dog  arrangement is typically regarded as a satire of pre-established harmony, Leibniz’s  </page> <page sequence="6"> Dogging the Subject 105 attempt to reconcile Cartesian dualism with the apparent interaction of mind  and body. Watt thus ponders “the manner in which this problem had been solved  . . . in that far distant past, when Mr Knott set up his establishment” (93).8 The  absurd complexity of the system, moreover, mocks Descartes’s method of making  “enumerations so complete, and reviews so comprehensive, that I could be sure of  leaving nothing out” (Discourse 120). Beckett’s emphasis on the suffering of the famished dogs reveals the ethical  dimension of his satire of Cartesian rationalism. Even Watt, who dislikes dogs, is  preoccupied with the canine participants in Mr Knott’s arrangement: “But much  more than with the Lynches, or with Mr Knott’s remains, Watt’s concern, while  it lasted, was with the dog” (116). That he is most disturbed by their suffering is  evident in his longing to know “which the sufferer, and what the sufferer, and  what the suffering” (117). And suffer they do: The dogs employed to eat Mr Knott’s occasional remains were not long-lived, as a  rule. This was very natural. For besides what the dog got to eat, every now and then,  on Mr Knott’s backdoorstep, it got so to speak nothing to eat. For if it had been  given food other than the food that Mr Knott gave it, from time to time, then its  appetite might have been spoilt, for the food that Mr Knott gave it. . . . Add to this  that the dog was seldom off the chain, and so got no exercise worth mentioning.  This was inevitable. For if the dog had been set free, to run about, as it pleased, then  it would have eaten the horsedung . . . and all the other nasty things that abound,  on the ground, and so ruined its appetite, perhaps for ever, or worse still would have  run away, and never come back. (112)  That the famished dogs suffer from perpetual emaciation and confinement  extends Beckett’s critique of Enlightenment rationalism to the problem of animal  suffering. Caught up in a Cartesian “mecanism [sic]” that rationalizes their condi- tion as “natural” and “inevitable,” the famished dogs offer a mute critique of the  absurdity of a philosophical tradition that strips animals of feeling and agency in  order to legitimize their exploitation (117).9 In Beckett’s trilogy, the use of dogs to satisfy human desires is most visible  in Teddy, the pet dog Molloy accidentally runs over with his bicycle. Teddy’s  death, rather than causing him pain, serves to “put [him] out of his misery” as his  owner, Lousse, is taking him to be destroyed (Three 33). The dog is “old, blind,  deaf, crippled with rheumatism and perpetually incontinent,” yet the real misery  from which Molloy unwittingly frees him is his degraded life as a woman’s pet  (33). As his name suggests, Teddy is little more than a comforting object, like the  “woolly bear” Moran’s son must “hug” in order to fall asleep (122). He belongs to  that category of animals so disparaged by Deleuze and Guattari: “individuated  animals, family pets, sentimental, Oedipal animals each with its own petty his- tory” (240). Far from representing a radical alterity that dissolves human fantasies  of identity and autonomy, Teddy merely “take[s] the place of a child” (47). Like  Miss Dew’s “so-called dog” in Murphy, he is an infantilized, neutered surrogate  (98).10 This logic of surrogacy enables Molloy to replace Teddy in turn, atoning for  </page> <page sequence="7"> 106 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 his misdeed by leading “a dog’s life” — a phrase Beckett uses elsewhere to describe  the situation of a henpecked man — while detained by the oppressively maternal  Lousse (More 167). Lousse, whose name is a homophone for the singular form  of “lice,” buries Teddy with “ticks in his ears,” confirming that his existence is  delimited by parasitic human desires (37). Lousse’s smothering affection for dogs and men alike evokes Beckett’s vexed  relationship with his mother, May, whose well-documented fondness for dogs and  donkeys no doubt informs their prominence in the Beckettian bestiary. Piecing  together biographical accounts that indicate that Beckett ran over one of May’s  Kerry Blue terriers in 1926, Daniel Katz proposes that “Teddy’s fatal accident  is itself a re-elaboration of [this] traumatic event” (250).11 Yet Beckett’s critique  of the profoundly humanist sentimentalization of the pet extends beyond his  maternal characters. A masculinized form of pet love is satirized in the story of Ernest Louit, told  by the servant Arthur in Watt. Louit, a university student, embarks with his bull  terrier O’Connor on a research expedition to County Clare. His pastoral vision  of traversing the countryside with his faithful dog at his heels and sleeping “in  the sweet-smelling hay . . . of the local barns” soon gives way to a harsh reality  punctuated by his discovery of “the skeleton of a goat” in one of only three barns  to be found (172). Starving and stranded in a bog, Louit is “reluctantly obliged  . . . to hold O’Connor head downward in the morass, until his faithful heart . . .  ceased to beat, and then roast him” (172). Man’s best friend to the end, O’Connor  makes the ultimate sacrifice for the human pursuit of knowledge represented by  Louit’s research findings, which “could not be of the smallest value to any person  other than himself and, eventually, humanity” (173). O’Connor’s sentimentalized  fidelity, moreover, ironically allows Louit to ennoble the squeamishness that pre- vents him from skinning his beloved pet: “He took no credit for this, O’Connor  in his place would have done the same for him” (173). The paradoxically elevated and subordinated status of the dog as pet is  also evident in Levinas’s essay on Bobby. Just as canine companionship bolsters  Lousse’s maternal identity and Louit’s pastoral fantasy, Bobby serves the (albeit  worthier) purpose of affirming the humanity of the prisoners of Camp 1492.  Bobby’s welcoming behavior echoes that of the ultimate figure of canine fidelity:  Argos, the ancient dog who “recognized Ulysses beneath his disguise” and, with  his last ounce of strength, dropped his ears and thumped his tail in an unmis- takably canine greeting (Levinas, “Name” 153). Bobby likewise recognizes the  prisoners as “men” despite the fact that the Nazi guards have “stripped us of our  human skin” (153). The central irony of Levinas’s essay is that the dog emerges as  the most human inhabitant of Camp 1492. The Nazi guards, though “called free,”  are brute enforcers of “Hitlerian violence,” while the prisoners are “subhuman,  a gang of apes” (153). Bobby, with his Kantian gesture, is able to do what the  prisoners cannot: “deliver a message about our humanity” (153). In recognizing  the prisoners’ violently suppressed humanity, the dog seems poised to transcend  his own animality. </page> <page sequence="8"> Dogging the Subject 107 Ultimately, though, Bobby’s value for Levinas lies in his role as a vehicle for  human transcendence. As Richard Nash observes, Levinas’s account echoes “the  sentimental logic of the pet — those special ‘domesticated’ animals who function  to confer upon us a greater humanity by actions and articulations that simulta- neously transcend their ‘animal’ status and accept the logic of domination and  domestication in which such transcendence is recontained” (101). This paradoxical  status of the pet is evident in the act of naming invoked by the essay’s title: “The  Name of a Dog.” Bobby’s name, though it seemingly elevates him by marking  his individuality, also relegates him to the subordinate position he shares with  Beckett’s Teddy and O’Connor. In this essay, Levinas presents the act of naming  sentimentally as something “one does with a cherished dog” (153). Elsewhere,  though, he characterizes naming as “a violence and a negation [that] denies the  independence of a being: it belongs to me” (“Is Ontology” 9). Bobby’s name, as I  have argued elsewhere (Kendall 192–193), thus serves to neutralize the challenge  he presents to humanist ethics by casting him in the familiar role of man’s best  friend: “[T]he dog will attest to the dignity of its person. This is what the friend of  man means” (Levinas, “Name” 152). As we will see, though, Beckett insists (and  Levinas intimates) that canine alterity is not so easily effaced, and its doggedness  poses a grave threat to the intelligibility of humanist ethics. The fAce of A Dog Levinas famously dubbed his ethics a “humanism of the other man,” marking  both his affinity and dissatisfaction with Enlightenment humanism.12 Levinasian  ethics remains resolutely humanist in asserting the primacy of the human subject  but breaks with a Cartesian or Kantian model premised on rationality. In Total- ity and Infinity, Levinas objects to the reduction of humans to mere “bearers of  forces” like reason or free will (21). For Levinas, ethical subjectivity originates not  in the self but in the encounter with the other, whose infinite alterity disrupts the  egoistic being of the self. While the self seeks impulsively to “nullify separation”  and possess the other as an object of knowledge, the face — Levinas’s term for the  inassimilable alterity of the other — prohibits this totalizing gesture by silently  voicing the commandment, “Thou shalt not kill” (251). In Levinas’s configuration,  I emerge as a subject in my encounter with the other precisely because I become  subject to the commandment issued by the face. My realization of the other-as- subject thus precedes and enables my own subjectivity. In this formulation, as  Levinas readily notes, “Man is an unreasonable animal” in that he is compelled  to suspend his self-interest for the sake of the other (“Paradox” 172). Levinas’s rejection of a subjectivity grounded in rational autonomy leads him  to align his project partially with the antihumanism he associates with thinkers  like Nietzsche, Heidegger, Lacan, and Lévi-Strauss: “Modern antihumanism,  which denies the primacy that the human person, a free end in itself, has for the  signification of being, is true over and above the reasons it gives itself ” (“Sub- stitution” 94). The antihumanist deconstruction of the a priori subject, far from  </page> <page sequence="9"> 108 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 bringing an end to ethical subjectivity, reveals (in spite of itself) that traditional  humanism “is not sufficiently human” — particularly in light of the atrocities of  World War II, which have “render[ed] tragicomic the concern for oneself and  illusory the pretension of the rational animal to have a privileged place in the cos- mos” (“Humanism” 127). Levinasian ethics, Peter Atterton observes, thus seems  ideally suited “to accommodate the inclusion of the other animal, and thereby  go beyond the very humanism — and human chauvinism — that has served as a  philosophical justification for the mistreatment of animals for over two millennia”  (61). What does the human encounter in the face of an animal if not an alterity  even more radical than that of the other human? Something rather less compelling  to Levinas, who explains: The Other is not other with a relative alterity as are, in a comparison, even ultimate  species, which mutually exclude one another but still have their place within the  community of a genus. The alterity of the Other does not depend on any quality that  would distinguish him from me, for a distinction of this nature would precisely imply  between us that community of genus which already nullifies alterity. (Totality 194)  Counterintuitively, Levinas proposes that animals cannot call humans into ethical  relations because our evolutionary kinship negates the alterity of species differ- ence. For Levinas, as for Kant, humans’ ethical obligations to animals are indirect,  “aris[ing] from the transference to animals of the idea of suffering” (“Paradox”  172). An animal cannot command of (or be commanded by) the other, “Thou  shalt not kill.”  Levinas’s essay on Bobby is especially puzzling given his tendency to foreclose  the possibility of animal alterity. Why not (forgive me) let sleeping dogs lie? The  invocation of Bobby opens up questions that Levinas strenuously avoids through- out most of his oeuvre. When confronted with the question of the animal in a  1986 interview, he strains to affirm human exceptionalism while simultaneously  implying a continuum of what I have elsewhere called “faciality” that problema- tizes the human/animal divide (Kendall 188). Here, Levinas admits, “I cannot say  at what moment you have the right to be called ‘face’ ” (“Paradox” 171). Moreover,  he offers an astonishingly inclusive response to the question of whether humans  have ethical obligations to other animals: “It is clear that, without considering  animals as human beings, the ethical extends to all living beings” (172). In con- templating the extension of ethics to “all living beings” and thus threatening to  muddle his entire philosophy, it appears that Levinas has Bobby in mind. When  pressed to explain what differentiates the human face from the animal face, he  replies, “One cannot entirely refuse the face of an animal. It is via the face that  one understands, for example, a dog” (169). He quickly adds that “[t]he phenom- enon of the face is not in its purest form in the dog” yet proceeds to undercut this  qualification: “But it also has a face” (169). While the face of a dog pushes Levinas to the brink of abandoning the  human/animal distinction that underwrites his neohumanist ethics, Beckett uses  the canine encounter as a point of departure for his more radical reconfiguration of  </page> <page sequence="10"> Dogging the Subject 109 the human and its relationship to animality. Like Watt, both Molloy and Moran  are irresistibly drawn to dogs (though not necessarily fond of them). Moran takes  perverse delight in teasing the neighbors’ dog: They had an aberdeen called Zulu. People called it Zulu. Sometimes, when I was in  a good humour, I called, Zulu! Little Zulu! and he would come and talk to me. . . .  Crouching down I would stroke his ears, through the railings, and utter wheedling  words. He did not realize he disgusted me. He reared up on his hind legs and pressed  his chest against the bars. Then I could see his little black penis ending in a thin  wisp of wetted hair. He felt insecure, his hams trembled, his little paws fumbled for  purchase, one after the other. I too wobbled, squatting on my heels. With my free  hand I held on to the railings. Perhaps I disgusted him too. I found it hard to tear  myself away from these vain thoughts. (Three 105)  This exchange seems initially to affirm the dog’s function as a symbol of  degraded humanity; in one of the earliest studies of the Beckettian dog, Philip  Howard Solomon reads the implicit “comparison between man and dog” as offer- ing an unflattering commentary on “the human condition” (85, 91). Yet while  Moran’s encounter with Zulu serves in part to blur the species boundary signified  by the railings separating his yard from the Elsner sisters’, it also underscores the  alterity of the canine neighbor. The physical instability of human and dog recalls  the calling into question of the self in the Levinasian encounter with the other,  while Moran’s musings testify to the dog’s inassimilable alterity. His clarification  that “people called it Zulu” alludes to the appropriative act of naming, and his  observation of the dog’s penis conjures the negated sexual agency of the pet. Zulu’s unknowability, however, does not prevent Moran from contemplat- ing the dog’s perspective; he speculates that Zulu “feels insecure” and wonders  whether the dog reciprocates his disgust. His awareness of being looked at by Zulu  parallels Derrida’s realization in The Animal That Therefore I Am when he describes  the experience of standing naked before a cat: “[I]t can look at me. It has its point  of view regarding me. The point of view of the absolute other . . .” (11). Like Der- rida, Moran sees himself seen by an animal and avoids both anthropomorphic  projections that efface alterity and the anthropocentric refusal to acknowledge the  animal’s point of view. That Moran resists the impulse to appropriate the other  is all the more significant given his tendency to define himself through posses- sions. Unlike Molloy, who intends but never manages “to draw up the inventory  of my goods and possessions” (14), Moran peppers his narrative with references  to “[m]y lamp,” “my bees,” “my house,” “my grounds,” etc.; he even adds his son  to this inventory, first by naming young Jacques after himself and then — as if  to retract the nod to individuality implicit in the act of naming — by referring to  him almost invariably as “my son” (92–93). As Moran’s attraction to Zulu suggests, human/dog encounters in Molloy  reveal the human’s pitiable isolation within the subject position delineated by the  humanist tradition. Molloy expresses frustration with this condition at the outset  of his journey when he observes a “face to face” meeting between two men he calls  </page> <page sequence="11"> 110 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 A and C (9). After they part, Molloy continues to watch one of them — “A or C,  I don’t remember” — but, “in spite of my soul’s leap out to him,” sees him “only  darkly” (11). The anonymity of this encounter, paired with Molloy’s ineffectual  desire to connect with the human other, stands in sharp contrast to A or C’s sub- sequent interaction with a pomeranian who appears at his heels: “[T]he gentleman  turned back, took the little creature in his arms, drew the cigar from his lips and  buried his face in the orange fleece . . .” (12). This exchange portrays humans and  dogs as always-already joined by an interspecies intimacy that permeates their  encounters. Molloy thus wonders: [W]hat prevented the dog from being one of those stray dogs that you pick up and  take in your arms, from compassion or because you have long been straying with no  other company than the endless roads, sands, shingle, bogs, and heather, than this  nature answerable to another court, than at long intervals the fellow convict you  long to stop, embrace, suck, suckle and whom you pass by, with hostile eyes, for fear  of his familiarities? Until the day when, your endurance gone, in this world for you  without arms, you catch up in yours the first mangy cur you meet, carry it the time  needed for it to love you and you it, then throw it away. (12)  To some extent, this passage positions the stray dog, like the pet dog, as a  disposable surrogate. Unable to embrace “the fellow convict,” the wanderer grasps  “the first mangy cur” to cross his path. Yet Molloy also expresses the loneliness  peculiar to a being trapped within a “nature answerable to another court” — that  is, human nature as circumscribed by the humanist tradition. Longing to trans- gress the borders of a subject position premised on the subjugation of embodiment  and animality, he finds himself “up against [A or C], up against the dog, gasping”  (12). Alarmed, A or C soon departs, leaving Molloy “alone, no . . . restored to  myself, no, I never left myself ” (13). In contrast to Beckett’s constrained and debilitated narrators, the dogs of  Molloy are remarkably mobile, refusing to remain confined to their position in  the humanist species hierarchy. An anonymous dog who strays into the grove  where Moran has set up camp confirms just how thoroughly the latter is “exiled  in his manhood” (169). Having suspended his search for Molloy, Moran wanders  aimlessly around his camp for three days before this passing dog “relieve[s] the  monotony” (153). Whereas Moran’s search never progresses beyond the camp- site, the dog exits the grove almost as soon as he has entered, “having simply as  it were gone straight through” (153). Even Teddy outpaces Molloy, who is every  bit as captive as Lousse’s pet parrot as he “sweep[s], with the clipped wings of  necessity,” to his mother’s house (27). Teddy, though similarly disabled, achieves  Molloy’s elusive objective: to “say my goodbyes, finish dying” (7). Molloy thus  resents the dog, reasoning, “His death must have hurt him less than my fall me.  And he at least was dead” (35). Teddy is buried “like a Carthusian monk, but  with his collar and lead,” his interment ironically signifying both spiritual ascen- sion in death and degrading captivity in life (36). Ultimately, though, Molloy is  the one who remains captive. He manages to escape from Lousse, but later falls  </page> <page sequence="12"> Dogging the Subject 111 into a ditch, where his narrative ends in resignation: “Molloy could stay, where  he happened to be” (91). The relative mobility of dogs makes them objects of fascination for Molloy  and Moran, whose respective encounters with a flock of sheep driven by a shep- herd and his dog offer a welcome respite from an all-too-human mode of being.  Molloy experiences a rare moment of “tranquil assurance” (28), while the usually  overbearing Moran finds himself “incapable of speech” (159). Observing the dog,  Molloy wonders, “Did he take me for a black sheep entangled in the brambles  and was he waiting for an order from his master to drag me out? I don’t think so.  I don’t smell like a sheep, I wish I smelt like a sheep, or a buck-goat” (28). Molloy  seems eager to be “dragged out” of his human form and to encounter the canine  other, not in the Levinasian realm of language, but on the dog’s olfactory terms.  While Molloy wants to smell like a sheep, Moran identifies with the dog in his  longing to follow the shepherd: “I will serve you faithfully, just for a place to lie  and a little food” (159). As with Zulu, he speculates about the dog’s point of view  without claiming unmediated access to it, noting that “there was no one to witness  his contentment, if that is what it was” (160). Both encounters breed a powerful  desire to transcend human form without negating canine alterity, pointing to  dogs’ special significance for Beckett’s posthumanism. fAcing oTher AnimALs  The reverent awe Molloy and Moran exhibit in the presence of the human- dog-sheep assemblage, besides signaling the attraction of dogs for Beckett’s  human, ushers in Beckett’s critique of the most potent instantiation of human- ism’s sacrificial structure — the modern slaughterhouse — and its devastating  impact on humanity and animality alike. This critique emerges almost surrepti- tiously through ironic invocations of the British pastoral tradition, whose usual  representative in Beckett’s oeuvre is William Wordsworth. Molloy alludes to  Wordsworth’s notion of “emotion recollected in tranquillity [sic]” (“Preface” 611)  when he notes, “It is in the tranquillity of decomposition that I remember the  long confused emotion which was my life . . .” (Three 25). That Molloy awakens  to the sight of the shepherd and his flock recalls a misreading of Wordsworth’s  Immortality Ode whereby “fields of sleep” (“Ode” l. 28) become “fields of sheep” — a  “compositor’s error” referenced in Murphy when Miss Dew tries vainly to feed let- tuce to a “miserable-looking lot” of sheep (99). Moran’s reverie likewise conjures  “that most excellent man” (Murphy 100): What a pastoral land, my God. . . . The silence was absolute. Profound in any case.  All things considered it was a solemn moment. The weather was divine. It was the  close of day. . . . How I would love to dwell upon [the shepherd]. His dog loved him,  his sheep did not fear him. (Three 158)  In the presence of animals, Moran ironically assumes the role of the Words- worthian speaker, his reflections painting an idealized picture of rural life. </page> <page sequence="13"> 112 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 Yet Beckett’s pastoral landscape, far from constituting a pristine retreat from  the human world, is filled with signs of humanity’s devastating presence. As a  cultivated landscape, it conveys both the sublime and grotesque effects of humans’  interactions with the nonhuman world. Thus, where Wordsworth’s speaker finds  “The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse, / The guide, the guardian of my  heart, and soul / Of all my moral being” (“Lines” ll. 110–12), Molloy finds only  “senseless, speechless, issueless misery” (Three 13). Here, animal presence, rather  than signaling the peaceful coexistence of humans and nonhumans in a landscape  where “every Beast keep[s] holiday,” reveals the violent underside of the pastoral  economy (Wordsworth, “Ode” l. 33). Molloy’s encounter with the sheep leads him  to wonder whether the flock is bound for pasture or slaughter, leaving him “with  persisting doubts” about which “there is much to be said” (29). Moran interrupts  his own Wordsworthian meditation with the disturbing thought that the sheep  might perceive him as “the butcher come to make his choice” (159). Surrounded  by animal death, Beckett’s human cannot achieve the transcendence associated  with the contemplation of nature in Romantic pastoralism. Dogs’ complicity in the violence of slaughter in Molloy brings us again to  Levinas’s essay on Bobby, which alludes to the sacrifice of other animals by open- ing with a verse from Exodus: “You shall be men consecrated to me; therefore  you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the  dogs” (“Name” 151). Following this epigraph, his thoughts turn not to Bobby, but  to the animals whom most humans encounter “at the family table, as you plunge  your fork into your roast. . . . There is . . . enough there to make us want to limit,  through various interdictions, the butchery that every day claims our ‘consecrated’  mouths!” (151). In these opening lines, it is animals destined for slaughter — not  Bobby — who appear poised to make moral claims on Levinas. Unlike the named  dog whose memory the essay preserves, these animals have become what Carol  J. Adams calls “absent referents”: beings who “enable the existence of meat” but  who are “absent from the act of eating meat because they have been transformed  into food” (51). They are likewise absent from Levinas’s essay, effaced literally and  figuratively as “roast” (Kendall 195). By alluding to butchered animals and thus problematizing their material and  rhetorical erasure, Levinas foregrounds the unpalatable matter of animal suffering  at the start of his essay. While he upholds the primacy of the human with the  modest proposal that we might merely “want to limit” (“Name” 151) the violence  committed for the sake of our appetites, his reference to industrialized slaughter in  the context of a Holocaust narrative intensifies what might otherwise be dismissed  as a droll depiction of meat eating as a testament to humans’ repressed animality.  In this way, John Llewelyn argues, Levinas “all but proposes an analogy between  the unspeakable human Holocaust and the unspoken animal one” (235). Levinas’s  obliqueness can be read in part as a response to Heidegger’s infamous assertion  that “[a]s for its essence, [the mechanized food industry] is the same thing as the  manufacture of corpses in the gas chambers and the death camps” — a cursory  comparison that Levinas elsewhere rejects as “beyond commentary” (“As If ” 487).  </page> <page sequence="14"> Dogging the Subject 113 Yet as David Clark argues, the comparative subtlety of Levinas’s rhetoric makes  the analogy all the more powerful: “[T]he fact that the question of our obligations  to animals is raised in such a maximally important context, indeed, as the opening  move in the evocation of that context, puts to us that the thought of the human,  no matter how profound . . . can never be wholly divorced from the thought of the  animal” (171). By implicitly linking the institutionalized sacrifice of humans to  that of other animals, without simply equating the two qua Heidegger, Levinas  compels his reader to entertain thoughts that “make one lose one’s appetite” for  animal flesh (“Name” 151). Levinas’s analogy — like Molloy’s and Moran’s concerns about the fate of  the flock — underscores the paradox of slaughter, which demonstrates powerfully  both the violence that the human-as-subject permits itself to inflict on animals  and the tenuousness of the humanity that serves as its justification. This paradox  has only intensified, Derrida argues, with the “unprecedented transformation” of  the human/animal relationship under the conditions of modernity (Animal 24).  The most potent sign of this transformation is industrialized animal agriculture,  the perverse cruelties of which Derrida also likens to genocide: “As if, for example,  instead of throwing a people into ovens and gas chambers (let’s say Nazi) doctors  and geneticists had decided to organize the overproduction and overgeneration  of Jews, gypsies, and homosexuals by means of artificial insemination, so that,  being continually more numerous and better fed, they could be destined in always  increasing numbers for the same hell . . .” (26). The dizzying magnitude of animal  life and death in modernized farming prompts Molloy’s exclamation: “Good  God, what a land of breeders, you see quadrupeds everywhere” (Three 29). Their  grim destination is confirmed by his observation that “slaughter-houses are not  confined to towns, no, they are everywhere, the country is full of them” (29). So  pervasive is the slaughterhouse that several of the trilogy’s characters live near  one. Molloy hears the “violent raucous tremulous bellowing . . . [of] shambles and  cattle-markets” from his mother’s room (22); Moran suspects his son of sneaking  off to a nearby slaughterhouse to avoid church; and The Unnamable lives on “a  quiet street near the shambles” (327).13 The unprecedented scale of slaughter in modernity — a result of increasingly  efficient technologies for producing and processing animal bodies — generated  equally unprecedented concerns about its implications for humanity. In his study  of changes in slaughtering methods over a period that spans the first several  decades of Beckett’s and Levinas’s lives (both were born in 1906), Jonathan Burt  notes that debates over the fraught concept of humane slaughter typically “focused  on the killing alone” rather than on broader animal welfare concerns (126). Mol- loy, too, fixates on the scene of animal death; he envisions the sheep “fall[ing],  their skulls shattered, their thin legs crumpling, first to their knees, then over on  their fleecy sides, under the pole-axe, though that is not the way they slaughter  sheep, but with a knife, so that they bleed to death” (Three 29). The act of killing,  imagined so vividly by Molloy, is precisely what interested a committee appointed  by the British Admiralty in 1904 to evaluate contemporary methods of slaughter,  </page> <page sequence="15"> 114 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 including ritual Jewish slaughter, or shechitah. The committee concluded that  shechitah “was not of ‘equal humanity’ ” with methods employing a pole-axe to  stun animals prior to killing them (Burt 127). The conflation of humanity and  humanness in these findings prefigures the anti-Semitism of the animal welfare  movement in 1930s Germany; in pursuit of the elusive goal of humane slaugh- ter, the method of killing became a litmus test for humanity in both senses of  the word. However, Molloy’s blunt description of sheep “crumpling .  .  . under  the pole-axe” or “bleed[ing] to death” — two methods deemed humane by their  respective proponents — offers no assurance of a humane death. For many, the key to making slaughter more humane lay in the development  of increasingly sophisticated stunning tools, and technologies improving upon  the pole-axe emerged in the 1920s. Electrical stunning in particular promised to  “further the cause of humanity,” as one of its developers boasted in 1929 (Mül- ler 166). This method had the particularly attractive effect of silencing animals,  according to a contributor to the British Veterinary Journal: “I have watched dozens  of pigs being anaesthetised by the electro-lethaler in a most easy and perfect way.  After each one was narcotized it was hoisted, stuck and bled without struggle or  squeal; the slaughterhouse was thus made a place of peaceful quiet” (Hill 53). As  this description indicates, the ethical impetus for humane slaughter became dif- ficult to disentangle from the aesthetic. Burt thus notes that these efforts to make  slaughter more humane disturbingly produced “slaughter at its most orderly and  mechanistic. There are no sounds of pigs squealing in agony, nothing to indicate  to a wider world, neighbors, or passersby the extent of the life-taking going on  within the slaughterhouse” (131). The aestheticization of slaughter supports Der- rida’s observation “that men do all they can in order to dissimulate this cruelty or  to hide it from themselves; in order to organize on a global scale the forgetting  or misunderstanding of this violence” (Animal 26). In Beckett’s trilogy, though,  “the slaughter-house loom[s] larger and larger,” signaling the inevitable failure of  attempts to silence dying animals in the name of humanity (Three 212). To some extent, Levinas’s essay positions Bobby as a proxy for these silenced  animals, and numerous commentators have read Bobby’s Kantian gesture as an  unheeded call to extend ethics to animals in general. Such readings overlook the  decidedly unsentimental essence of Levinas’s connection to Bobby signaled by  the verse from Exodus. In citing a verse that compels humans to cast undesirable  flesh “to the dogs,” Levinas, like Beckett, exposes the violent underpinnings of  the human/dog relationship. By underscoring how dogs facilitate and benefit from  the sacrifice of nonhuman, non-canine animals, Beckett and Levinas indicate that  dogs are best understood not as representatives of “the animal” — a homogenous  category opposed to the human — but as what Haraway calls “[p]artners in the  crime of human evolution” (Companion 5). The enterprising wolves who exploited  “the calorie bonanzas provided by humans’ waste dumps,” Haraway explains,  eventually became the domesticated companions whose labor facilitated the rise of  hunter-gatherer and agricultural societies (29). Humans and dogs have shaped one  another’s biological and cultural histories precisely because each species enabled  </page> <page sequence="16"> Dogging the Subject 115 the other “to consume well” (Haraway, When 17). On an evolutionary scale, the  shared appetite for meat engendered a partnership premised on the subjugation  of other animals — a legacy that haunts the canine encounter in Beckett’s fiction  and Levinas’s essay. concLusion  While Levinas ultimately attempts to assimilate Bobby’s alterity by sentimental- izing him as “the friend of man,” Beckett’s dogs invariably exceed their roles as  emblems of degradation, as surrogates for the other human, and as representatives  of “the animal” (“Name” 152). Beckett’s insistence on dogs’ dual status as victims  of the humanist disavowal of animality and as vital participants in systematized  violence against other animals indicates that any ethical thinking about “the ani- mal” must begin by interrogating that very category and acknowledging the het- erogeneous multiplicity of life forms it purports to encompass. In this way, Beckett  anticipates Derrida’s critique not only of the bêtise whereby post-Enlightenment  humanism condemns beings called animal to “a noncriminal putting to death”  (“Eating” 278), but also of the residual humanism that inheres in much of the  postmodern and poststructuralist thought with which Beckett’s work is frequently  aligned. It follows that any examination of the animal and its relationship to the  human in Beckett’s oeuvre must take into consideration how Beckett problema- tizes these terms by deconstructing the sacrificial logic that underwrites the death  camps and the slaughterhouse alike. At the same time, Beckett’s dogs offer the human a kind of hope via the inter- ruptive power of the canine encounter. In an oft-quoted passage, Molloy describes  himself as confined to a “sealed jar to which I [owe] my being so well preserved,”  yet his need to shore up the self by shutting out exteriority competes with his  persistent longing for connection — a longing both intensified and frustrated by  the animal suffering that permeates the Beckettian landscape (Three 49). Even  from within the jar, he hears “other things calling me and towards which too one  after the other my soul was straining, wildly. I mean of course the fields . . . and  the animals . . . and my hand on my knee and above all the other wayfarer, A or  C, I don’t remember, going resignedly home” (11). The sealed jar of the humanist  subject position estranges Molloy from his environment, its animal inhabitants,  his fellow human wayfarers, and even his own body, but occasionally “a wall  [gives] way” as he strains toward exteriority (49). Dogs’ ability to interrupt the  endless cogitations of Beckett’s narrators offers the human a way out of its egois- tic being — one that requires a rethinking of the self/other relation that extends  beyond the narrow category of the human. Thus, Beckett’s apparently anethical  stance toward animal suffering stems not from a reluctance to acknowledge the  animal face, but from his cognizance of the immense but urgent task of learning,  in Haraway’s words, “how to see who [animals] are and hear what they are telling  us, not in [the] bloodless abstraction” of sweeping pronouncements about “the  animal,” “but in one-on-one relationship, in otherness-in-connection” (Companion  </page> <page sequence="17"> 116 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 45). Like Bobby, Beckett’s dogs challenge the human to learn how to respond,  not just to the human other in its relative alterity, but to animal others in their  radical alterity and heterogeneity. Notes  1. My use of gendered terminology throughout this essay is deliberate, for it is typically Beckett’s  male characters who find themselves unable to make sense of their species membership. Moreover,  the post-Enlightenment subject under discussion is, I would argue, prototypically male. 2. For early studies that read Beckett’s animals as emblems of degraded humanity, see Chambers  and Solomon. Signs of a growing interest in animals within the field of Beckett studies are the  Beckett and Animality conference held at the University of Reading in 2009 and a recent anthol- ogy based on its proceedings, Samuel Beckett and Animality, edited by Mary Bryden (Cambridge:  Cambridge UP, 2012). 3. The association of canine bodies with grotesque sexuality is visible in a number of texts. In How It  Is, the narrator describes a dog “lower[ing] its snout to its black and pink penis too tired to lick” (30)  and later remarks, “my spinal dog it licked my genitals” (85). At the beginning of Mercier and Camier,  an awkward embrace between “our heroes” is rendered even more so by the presence of two dogs  “copulating, with the utmost naturalness,” a few feet away (9). Molloy describes his sexual relation- ship with Edith, a woman he meets “in a rubbish dump,” in canine terms: “She bent over the couch,  because of her rheumatism, and in I went from behind. . . . It seemed all right to me, for I had seen  dogs, and I was astonished when she confided that you could go about it differently” (Three 56–57). 4. Connor attributes this response to “the presence of animals” more generally, as the scenes in  question involve dogs and sheep (30). Below, I discuss the special significance of dogs in such multi- species assemblages. 5. See Derrida, Animal 27–29. 6. Biographer Anthony Cronin notes that this passage depicts “[o]ne of the traumas of [Beckett’s]  childhood” (21). 7. The expression of donkeys also proves compelling for Belacqua in Dream of Fair to Middling  Women: “The appearance of domestic animals of all kinds he disliked, save the extraordinary coun- tenance of the donkey seen full-face” (127). Beckett’s mother, May, owned a number of donkeys, and  at least one of these — Kisch, named by Beckett and his brother — was purchased from an abusive  owner (Cronin 22). 8. See, for example, Ackerley and Gontarski 454, 630–31. 9. The breeding program outlined in Beckett’s notebooks, in which Irish setters and Palestine  retrievers are crossed to produce the optimal variety of famished dog found in the novel, further  underscores the material ways in which human whims shape canine bodies by alluding to the world  of dog breeding — a world with which Beckett no doubt came into contact via his mother, who owned  and exhibited “a whole series of Kerry Blue terriers” (Beckett, qtd. in Knowlson and Knowlson 7).  Regarding Mr Knott’s breeding program, see Ackerley and Gontarski 146. Anna O’Meara de Vic  Beamish, one of Beckett’s neighbors while he was writing Watt, “used to breed Airedale terriers in a  kennel in Cannes” (Beckett, qtd. in Knowlson and Knowlson 85) and had written two books inspired  by her dogs in the 1930s (Knowlson 300). 10. When Murphy first meets Miss Dew, she is holding “a lead whereby her personality was extended  to a Dachshund so low and so long that Murphy had no means of telling whether it was a dog or a  bitch,” indicating the literal and figurative neutering of the pet dog (98). </page> <page sequence="18"> Dogging the Subject 117 11. See also Knowlson 79–80. Cronin notes that Beckett “took care never to own an animal and  take responsibility for its well-being or its love” (21). That Beckett viewed pet-keeping as a weighty  responsibility indeed is indicated by the fact that he “contemplated suicide” following the death of  one of his mother’s Kerry Blues — the one killed in the accident, by Katz’s account — and later grieved  the death of another with whom he had taken many walks and who appears in More Pricks Than  Kicks and Krapp’s Last Tape (Cronin 248–49, 258). In the latter case, he regretted not being able to  “be with her at the end, to try and make it perhaps a little easier,” and had difficulty persuading his  distraught mother “to take a reasonable view of what oneself could not take a reasonable view of ”  (qtd. in Knowlson 244–5). 12. This is a translation of the title of Levinas’s 1972 book, Humanisme de l ’autre homme, sometimes  translated simply as “humanism of the other.” As we will see, though, Levinas has in mind an  exclusively human other. 13. See Beckett, Three 95, 97. In Malone Dies, too, the eponymous narrator tells the story of Lambert,  “a connoisseur of mules” (212) with a “gift” for “sticking pigs” (201) and later imagines “the last  stage of the horse” as it stands at the gates of the slaughterhouse (230). The Unnamable’s location  corresponds to that of a room Beckett rented near the cattle market in Camden Town, London, in  1932 (Knowlson 195). In Murphy, Celia rents a room in the same neighborhood “between Pentonville  Prison and the Metropolitan Cattle Market” (63). Works Cited  Ackerley, C.J., and S.E. Gontarski.
