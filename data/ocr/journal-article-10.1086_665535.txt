      <p>In their edited volume <italic>Nature and Society</italic>, Philippe Descola and Gísli Pálsson argue that anthropology has an important role to play in challenging the persistence of dualistic thinking with respect to what they call the “nature-society interface” (Descola and Pálsson 1996:1). Anthropology, they claim, is well placed to mount this challenge because ethnography supplies compelling evidence of the existence of nondualistic or “monistic” societies: “For many anthropologists … the shift from a dualist to a monist perspective appears to have been triggered by fieldwork among peoples for whom the nature-society dichotomy was utterly meaningless” (Descola and Pálsson 1996:7). Pointing to the existence of “many societies where the realm of social relations encompasses a wider domain than the mere society of humans,” they call for an anthropology that goes beyond “conventional social analysis” to “embrace not only the world of <italic>anthropos</italic>, but also that part of the world with which humans interact” (Descola and Pálsson 1996:14). This idea of an unconventional social analysis that, transcending anthropocentrism and ethnocentrism alike, takes seriously the possibility of society beyond humanity is certainly an exciting one. But if residual nature-society dualism is to be effectively challenged, proponents of monistic sociality must provide credible examples.</p>
      <p>The example almost invariably given is that of hunter-gatherers. Hunter-gatherers have come to stand for an expanded, heterospecific sphere of sociality that includes humans and the animals they hunt, which are viewed as sharing partners. Sharing is said to be central not just to interaction within the hunter-gatherer band but also to interaction with prey animals. While the hunt has long been viewed as a site of human-animal antagonism or opposition (Cartmill 1993), the hunting-as-sharing thesis turns this view on its head and represents hunting as an intimate, mutualistic, and even nonviolent relationship between hunter and hunted animal.</p>
      <p>In this article, I examine this argument through the work of two of its main proponents: Nurit Bird-David and Tim Ingold. I argue that the notion of sharing, while it does apply to the hunt, does not apply to the hunt in the way that is claimed. I show that hunting as a spatiotemporal event generally precludes anything resembling bandlike sociality from emerging between hunter and prey animal. Drawing on biologist Robert Hinde’s model of relationships, I argue that the conditions of hunting foreclose the development of a personal relationship between the hunter and the animals he hunts. I do not deny that personal human-animal relationships—and by extension human-animal cosociality—exist, but I argue that to find them we need to look at domesticated animals rather than the wild animals of the hunt.</p>

         <title>The Hunting-as-Sharing Thesis</title>
         <p>Sharing behavior has been widely reported in hunter-gatherer societies (especially “immediate-return” hunter-gatherers, who do not practice storage; Dowling 1968; Marshall 1961; Woodburn 1998). Meat sharing is said to offset the chronic uncertainty of the hunt. Lorna Marshall wrote that through sharing, “the fear of hunger is mitigated; the person one shares with will share in turn when he gets meat” (Marshall 1961:236). Sharing serves as a “banking strategy” whereby through the sharing of surplus food now, one is entitled to draw on the surplus food of others later (Kelley 1995:167). There are no permanent haves and have-nots because things even themselves out over time. The essence of sharing is what James Woodburn calls “donor obligation” and “recipient entitlement” (Woodburn 1998:49). Sharing usually occurs in response to demands from others to share and is sometimes characterized as “demand sharing” (Peterson 1993). In the face of a demand to share, the provider or donor has little choice but to accede. Such sharing transactions are said to have an important social logic. Through regular sharing activity, close relationships among band members develop. But the integrative power of sharing is not limited to the human members of the hunter-gatherer band. Sharing also provides the framework for human ties with the natural world and in particular with hunted animals.</p>
         <p>In an influential paper, Nurit Bird-David argued that hunter-gatherers liken the unconditional giving or sharing behavior among themselves to their dealings with the forest (Bird-David 1992:28–31). The human and nonhuman parts of the world coexist in a single sphere, which she calls a “cosmic economy of sharing.”<disp-quote>
               <p>They do not inscribe into the nature of things a division between the natural agencies and themselves as we do with our “nature∶culture” dichotomy. They view their world as an integrated entity. While many other non-Western peoples view the world in this fashion, it seems that hunter-gatherers with immediate return systems distinctively view their ties with the natural agencies in terms of visiting and sharing relationships. We can say that their world … is a cosmic system of sharing which embraces both human-to-human and nature-to-human sharing. The two kinds of sharing are constituents of a cosmic economy of sharing. (Bird-David 1992:30)</p>
            </disp-quote>For Bird-David, the forest is a “sharing partner” to which one can express one’s neediness in order to obtain food (Bird-David 1992:31). In another paper, which examined four hunter-gatherer societies, she concluded that “nature and humankind are ‘seen’ within a ‘subject-subject’ frame as interrelated in various forms of personal relatedness” (Bird-David 1993:121). Nature is reckoned not as an object to be exploited through extraction but as a subject to be engaged through sharing.</p>
         <p>Tim Ingold has further developed Bird-David’s notion of the “cosmic economy of sharing,” applying it more directly to hunting. In the well-known paper “From Trust to Domination,” Ingold argued, with respect to hunter-gatherer societies, that hunting “is an attempt to draw the animals in the hunters’ environment into the familiar ambit of social being, and to establish a working basis for mutuality and co-existence” (Ingold 1994:12). From the hunter’s point of view, hunting is essentially similar to the sharing practiced within the band. As he put it in an earlier paper, “sharing and hunting … are two sides of the same coin; each implies the other” (Ingold 1987:117). Particular encounters in the hunting ground are enclosed by a larger human-animal relationship.<disp-quote>
               <p>The animals in the environment of the hunter do not simply go their own way, but are supposed to act with the hunter in mind. They are not just “there” for the hunter to find and take as he will, rather they <italic>present themselves</italic> to him. … The encounter, then, is a moment in the unfolding of a continuing—even lifelong—relationship between the hunter and the animal kind (of which every particular individual encountered is a specific instance). The hunter hopes that by being good to animals, they in turn will be good to him. By the same token, the animals have the power to withhold if any attempt is made to coerce what they are not, of their own volition, prepared to provide. For coercion, the attempt to extract by force, represents a betrayal of the trust that underwrites the willingness to give. Animals thus maltreated will desert the hunter, or even cause him ill fortune. This is the reason why … the encounter between hunter and prey is conceived as basically non-violent. (Ingold 1994:14–15, references removed, original emphasis)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Where Ingold goes beyond Bird-David is to challenge her initial argument that sharing with nature is metaphorical (the title of Bird-David’s 1993 paper is “Tribal Metaphorization of Human-Nature Relatedness”). Bird-David had argued that “human-nature relatedness” was a metaphorical extension of relatedness among humans. Sharing among humans is, as it were, literal sharing, which is then figuratively extended to the domain of nature. Humans use their own social relations as a template for relations with the natural world. But, by approaching the issue in this way, she in effect makes relations between humans primary (literal sharing) and human-nature (or human-animal) relations secondary (metaphorical sharing). In short, Bird-David represents hunter-gatherer understandings of social relations as projections from the human-human to the human-nature domain. Ingold takes issue with this model on the grounds that it partly retains the nature-society dualism it purports to reject.</p>
         <p>Ingold argues instead that sociality in the two cases is not analogous or metaphorical but identical, inhering in the practical interactions or encounters of daily life.<disp-quote>
               <p>We have seen how both sharing (among humans) and hunting (of animals by humans) rest on the same principle of trust, and how the sense in which hunters claim to know and care for animals is identical to the sense in which they know and care for other human beings. (Ingold 1994:18)</p>
            </disp-quote>As far as hunter-gatherer sociality goes, there is a parity between human and nonhuman “persons.” Thus, in his discussion of Cree hunters, Ingold writes of “the ontological equivalence of humans and animals, as organism-persons and as fellow participants in a life process” (Ingold 1996:135).</p>
         <p>For Ingold, Bird-David’s analysis of hunter-gatherer understandings of human-nature sociality is wanting because she treats as metaphorical something that is “identical.” This is a bold claim on his part, and the onus is on him to demonstrate that hunting does indeed consist of a sociality between hunter and hunted that is similar to that within the hunter-gatherer band. However, when examined closely, hunting proves to be a very poor illustration of human-animal cosociality. By its very nature as an event, hunting provides minimal opportunity for the emergence of a human-animal sociality that is in any way comparable with the sociality of the band. When we look carefully at the argument, we find that Ingold’s monism proves to be scarcely less problematic than Bird-David’s.</p>

         <title>Hinde’s Model of Relationships</title>
         <p>One of the difficulties that arise in examining claims about “sociality” is that it is not always clear what is meant by the term. While “society” has classically denoted the idea of an abstract, bounded whole, with “sociality” the focus tends to be on concrete social relationships. But we still need to elucidate just what we mean when we use the term “social relationships.” Moreover, in a discussion about the possible existence of human-animal sociality, we must ensure that the analytical language we use is not so anthropocentrically loaded as to preclude nonhumans from the outset. To help provide both conceptual clarity and an appropriately inclusive idiom in this context, I draw on the model of relationships formulated by the biologist Robert Hinde.</p>
         <p>Hinde distinguishes between interactions and relationships in terms of their temporal character: an interaction is a relatively short-lived event that happens in the here and now, whereas a relationship consists of a series of interactions and therefore exists over a longer span of time (Hinde 1979:15–16). In principle, there is a cumulative development whereby earlier interactions between two individuals affect later interactions between them: “Because the individuals are known to each other, the nature and course of each interaction is influenced by the history of past interactions between the individuals concerned, and perhaps also by their expectations for interactions in the future” (Hinde 1979:5). The threshold for a “relationship” is therefore higher than that for an interaction, or a one-off encounter. Thus, “we do not speak of two strangers who meet in the street as immediately having a relationship, reserving the term for cases where the interaction is affected by past interactions or is likely to influence future ones” (Hinde 1981:2).</p>
         <p>Hinde draws attention to the importance of serial interactions in “the dynamics of interindividual relationships” (Hinde 1983:65). A history of interaction is likely to accentuate mutual knowledge between interactants, which in turn affects subsequent interactions between them. Through this process, the relationship tends to deepen over time and becomes “more intimate, in the sense that the behaviour of each individual is becoming more finely attuned to that of the other” (Hinde 1983:66). The primatologist Hans Kummer has made the same point: “A relationship is the result of history—it has developed through times past. The partners have learned from previous interactions what is possible between them and what is not. Relationship is the matured potential of two individuals for doing certain things together” (Kummer 1995:276). Regular interactions that extend over the long term can confer on the relationship a “comfortable predictability” (Duck 1992:86). The special quality of many a relationship arises, in no small part, from this interactional history.</p>
         <p>We can distinguish two kinds of relationship in Hinde’s model. The primary form of relationship is that based on serial interactions between the same two individuals. It is these personal relationships that Hinde is, for the most part, interested in. But he also recognizes that the same relationship logic can apply to categories of people:<disp-quote>
               <p>Just as interactions with an individual are affected by past interactions, so also may interactions with one of a category of individuals be affected by previous interactions with other members of that category. … In such cases we may speak of relationships between categories of individuals. This is a weak usage of “relationship” in comparison with series of interactions between individuals. (Hinde 1976:5)</p>
            </disp-quote>Hinde refers to the primary form of relationship as “personal” and this secondary form of relationship as “formal” (Hinde 1979:38).</p>
         <p>The hunting-as-sharing thesis is predicated on an understanding of sociality that corresponds to Hinde’s primary, or “personal,” form of relationship. This is the kind of sociality attributed to the hunter-gatherer band and therefore what the human-animal association in the hunt is measured against. Let us now look at the personal relationships of the band in order to prepare the ground for our later examination of the claimed sociality of the hunt.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sc3">
         <title>Personal Relationships in the Band</title>
         <p>Nurit Bird-David describes the extent and depth of the mutual familiarity among Nayaka hunter-gatherers as follows: “They ‘grow old together,’ getting to know each other’s biography, personality, habits and idiosyncrasies, and experiencing for themselves what happens in the hamlet” (Bird-David 1994:591). Kin ties are flexibly reckoned and grounded in interaction; this is a social world in which “‘relating’ makes ‘relatives’” (Bird-David 1994:594). She claims that Fred Myers’s observation about the Pintupi of Australia applies to the Nayaka too: “shared activity constitutes people as related” (Myers 1986:92; in Bird-David 1994:594). Referring to Alfred Schutz’s distinction between “we relationships” and “they relationships,” she argues that “we relationships” are central to hunter-gatherer sociality (Bird-David 1994:598–599). In invoking Schutz, Bird-David stresses the temporal depth of relationships in the hunter-gatherer band. For Schutz, the “we relationship” consists of a special connectedness conveyed by the notion of consociation: “consociates are mutually involved in one another’s biography; they are growing older together; they live, as we may call it, in a pure We-relationship” (Schutz 1953:12). There is a stark difference between consociation and mere association. As David Plath has put it, “If ‘associates’ are persons you happen to encounter somewhere, sometime, ‘consociates’ are people you relate with across time and in some degree of intimacy” (Plath 1980:8).</p>
         <p>Ingold, too, has highlighted the special quality of band sociality. Drawing on Bird-David’s characterization of hunter-gatherer relationships as “we relationships,” he has written that the band is a social environment distinguished by a “deep, intersubjective involvement of self and other. As such, it depends upon the deep mutual knowledge that people can only gain through spending time together: on the intertwining or even merging of their respective life histories” (Ingold 1999:406). What this means is that when the social relationships of the hunter-gatherer band are described as “immediate,” this “immediacy” should not be understood in terms of an absence of temporal depth but rather in the sense of people fitting seamlessly together in their interactions precisely because of the depth of mutual familiarity (Ingold 1999:405–406). In this connection, we can recall Ingold’s image of “growth”: “Selves … are ‘grown’ within a field of nurture” (Ingold 1999:407). “Food sharing is just one aspect of the total process by which persons are ‘grown’ in a context of immediate sociality, through incorporating the substance, knowledge, and experience of others within a field of nurturance” (Ingold 1999:408). In short, the hunter-gatherer band grows or nurtures persons in the fertile soil of intimate sociality. The quality of the “we relationship” is something realized by means of an extended process of cultivation.</p>
         <p>Ingold’s point is that band relationships between people are not mental constructions but are experientially grounded and constituted, developing through everyday interactions. Each relationship between two people has its history in which it has been built up through regular contact. This would seem to be precisely what an “intimate social group” is: a collectivity consisting of experientally rich relationships between people. Human sociality, in other words, must be understood in terms of “practical involvement with the world” rather than projections onto the world (Ingold 1996:125). Thus, “the perception of the social world is grounded in the direct, mutually attentive involvement of self and other in shared contexts of experience” (Ingold 1996:129). Interactional experience forms the basis of relationships between people in the hunter-gatherer band.</p>
         <p>This intimate sociality reported for the hunter-gatherer band fits neatly with Hinde’s conception of personal relationships. Band members have a fine-grained knowledge of one another built up over a long series of regular interactions that are centered on and shaped by a sharing ethos. In order for the hunting-as-sharing argument to stand up, we would need to find comparable relationships between hunters and the animals they hunt.</p>

         <title>The Relationship with the Animal Spirit</title>
         <p>In the long quotation above (Ingold 1994:14–15), Ingold acknowledges something that in much of his writing on this topic tends to be obscured: that the hunter’s relationship exists not in a one-to-one encounter with the animal hunted but at the level of the “animal kind.” Human-animal “sharing” in the context of the hunt, in other words, pertains to animals as members of a class. What Ingold is referring to here is a widespread belief complex among hunter-gatherers according to which a spirit figure, described variously as the Animal Spirit, Owner of the Animals, Master of Animals, Animal Guardian, and so on, controls the prey animals.<sup>1</sup> For the hunter, maintaining a benign relationship with this animal spirit or guardian—hereafter “Spirit”—is critical to whether the hunt ends in success or failure (Erikson 2000:12; Ichikawa 1996:472; Riches 1996:289). The Spirit is often attributed a humanlike appearance—including that of a “dwarf-like” being (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1976:312), an old man (Vitebsky 2005:311), and a bearded white man (Descola 1994:257)—and is given humanlike terms of address such as “Grandfather” (Vitebsky 2005:312). Furthermore, it is likened to a human herder carefully guarding his animal flock (Descola 1994:257–258; Ingold 1987:249–253; Viveiros de Castro 1992:72–73).</p>
         <p>As the owner of the animals, the Spirit becomes the object of hunter petitioning to share them. Yukaghir hunters in Siberia provide a good example of this:<disp-quote>
               <p>People have the acknowledged right to demand that those who possess goods beyond their immediate needs give them up, and the owner of those goods must comply with the demands or risk social disapproval. With regard to the hunter-spirit relationship, this means that as long as an animal master-spirit possesses plenty of game the hunter is entitled to ask or even demand that the spirit share its animal resources with him, and the spirit for its part is morally obliged to comply with the hunter’s demands. (Willerslev 2007:45)</p>
            </disp-quote>In this way, the principle of “recipient entitlement” is extended beyond interhuman sharing. The empty-handed hunter is entitled to request animals from the Spirit, who in turn is obliged to “give” or “share” with the hunter insofar as he is a needy have-not.<sup>2</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Represented in this way, hunting appears as a kind of sharing transaction in which the hunter shares with a Spirit that has a kind of one-to-many relation with the animals. As custodian of the animals as a class, the Spirit is in a position to part with individual constituents of the class. Individual animals become expendable because what matters is the existence of the class of animals. Hunting success can continue as long as the hunter maintains a proper relationship with the Spirit that controls the class of animals. The Spirit shares with the hunter with respect to the whole category of animals it controls.</p>
         <p>Prima facie, the hunter’s tie with the Spirit would seem to approximate a Hindean personal relationship. It is a relationship that consists of a series of interactions in the form of the different hunts, each of which cumulatively affects and is affected by the overarching relationship. Ingold has argued that for hunter-gatherers, success in the hunt is seen as related to hunter conduct in past hunting episodes, “the idea that success in present hunting depends on personal relationships built up and maintained with animal powers through a history of previous hunts” (Ingold 1994:10). Understood in this way, a hunt never stands alone but is informed by the relationship developed through previous hunts. Each hunt is an interaction that carries over into the larger relationship with the Spirit. With respect to the tie with the Spirit, hunting has a cumulative dimension. If the hunter offends the Spirit in one hunt (e.g., by openly showing joy or pride at hunting success or by behaving inappropriately toward the remains of the dead animal), he could suffer retribution in the form of hunting failure next time around. There is no such thing as a discrete hunt, for each hunt is connected to other hunts through the relationship between hunter and Spirit. Just as the hunter should display skill in the hunt, he should be skilful in managing this key relationship, on which success or failure also depends.</p>
         <p>On the face of it, Ingold would seem to be describing a personal relationship according to Hinde’s definition. Ingold is at pains to stress that hunting is embedded in a relationship that straddles the two sides of the hunt. But is this really a personal relationship? In fact, he refers to “personal relationships built up and maintained with animal powers” (Ingold 1994:10) rather than with the animals themselves. This means that the “personal relationship” in question is not directly with the animals hunted but with the anthropomorphic Spirit figure that hunters associate with the class of hunted animals. In other words, we are dealing not with a personal relationship between hunter and hunted animal but with a quasi-personal relationship with a class figurehead. The hunter’s construction of the Spirit serves to abstractly bridge separate hunts. The particular animals hunted on different occasions all come under the umbrella of the Spirit, which encompasses the class of animals. This belief makes it possible to connect earlier hunts with later hunts and to configure hunting as a single, enduring relationship. To recall the earlier quotation from Ingold (1994:15), each hunt is “a moment in the unfolding of a continuing—even lifelong—relationship” between hunter and Spirit. But, according to Hinde’s model of relationships, this would be no more than a “formal” or categorical relationship with the animals themselves. Hunting is subsumed within a relationship with the Spirit that works through interactions with particular animals. There is no actual continuity between different hunts as far as the individual animal hunted is concerned.</p>
         <p>That hunting-as-sharing has to do with the categorical animal other rather than individual animals is not always clear from Ingold’s writings. At times, the impression is given that it is the particular animal being hunted that is the sharing partner with the hunter. This would mean, of course, that the animal gives or shares itself with the hunter. This is especially the case when Ingold refers to Cree ethnography. It is from the Cree material that he takes the idea of a particular animal giving itself (Ingold 1994:9–10, 1996:129–136, 2000:13–14). He then inserts this idea—of what we might call animal autodonation—into his larger hunting-as-sharing model.</p>
         <p>In passing, two objections might be raised here. First, the Cree material is far from clear-cut when it comes to the idea of animal autodonation. Cree ethnography suggests that the notion of animals giving themselves to hunters is only part of the story, as animal guardians also feature (see Brightman 1993:93; Feit 1994:433). Second, in the wider ethnography of hunter-gatherers, the motif of prey animal autodonation to hunters is a relatively minor one, compared with that of the animal Spirit as giver of these animals on the one hand and that of spirit vengeance (of the hunted animal) on the other. Ingold acknowledged the importance of the animal Spirit among hunter-gatherers in his earlier work (Ingold 1987, chap. 10). Yet in his later writing on hunting-as-sharing, the theme of the animal Spirit is largely relegated to the background. Nonetheless, as a general thesis, the idea of hunting-as-sharing really makes sense only in relation to the Spirit as the figurehead of the animal class.</p>
         <p>Why, then, does Ingold not foreground the Spirit motif in his account of hunting-as-sharing? Why does he conflate or even replace it with the notion of autodonation at the level of particular animals? The answer would seem to lie in his theoretical commitment to the idea of practical sociality—that social ties inhere not in mental representations but in direct interaction and contact. From this perspective, human-animal sociality is measured by the extent of direct engagement. But to base straightforwardly the hunting-as-sharing thesis on the Spirit belief complex would leave Ingold open to the same kind of criticism he makes of Bird-David: that he is dealing not with direct human-animal sharing of a kind similar to the sociality in the hunting band but with a model of human-human sociality that is projected onto animals in the guise of the Spirit figure.</p>
         <p>Furthermore, the status of real animals is unclear. On the one hand, animals are recognized as having “autonomy” (Ingold 1994:13). Animal autonomy is the foundation on which Ingold builds his argument about the centrality of “trust” in the hunter-prey animal relationship (Ingold 1994:13). If a prey animal has volition, it is incumbent on the hunter to behave in a way that will dispose the animal to choose to give itself to him. It is because he is dealing with volitional animals that the hunter does not take the animal’s life but waits to be given it. Yet vis-à-vis the Spirit, animals seem far from autonomous but rather subordinated to the will of the Spirit, who “owns” them. Prey animals appear not so much to give themselves to the hunter as to be given by the Spirit to the hunter. They seem to be a kind of currency or medium of exchange between hunter and the Spirit rather than a party to exchange with the hunter.</p>
         <p>To a considerable extent, the Spirit seems to have the same kind of trophic relation to animals as the hunter. Philippe Descola has written that “Like the Achuar, who kill and eat their domestic fowl while protecting them from animal predators, the spirits kill and eat game while protecting it from human predators” (Descola 1994:258). Existing one level up from the animals themselves, the Spirit is the owner of the animals, with interests that potentially clash with those of the human hunters who also want these animals. If the Spirit, too, relies on the meat of the animals, it would logically reckon human hunting in zero-sum terms, seeing human success in the hunt as diminishing its stock of animals.</p>
         <p>The hunter must enter into and maintain a relationship with the Spirit in order to get it to share its animals. The hunter can invoke the sharing ethic—and the principle of “recipient entitlement” in particular—as leverage to get the Spirit to agree to release some of its many animals so that successful hunting can occur. Represented in this way, the hunter receives animals from a Spirit that is disposed to share some of its “herd,” and the sharing model does extend to the domain of human-animal relations. But crucially, this does not mean that it is the hunter and the hunted animal that are sharing. Rather, it is the hunter and the Spirit that are sharing the animals between them. Put another way, the corollary of the Spirit belief is that the hunter shares with animals generically or as a category rather than with the particular animal hunted. With respect to sharing, the hunt is reckoned in terms of what amounts to a categorical ontology: the hunter may catch a particular animal in the course of a hunt but shares with the Spirit that presides over the animal class. The particular animal hunted is an aspect of rather than a party to the sharing relationship. The prey animal can be a sharing partner—an animal subject—only at a higher, abstract level corresponding to the Spirit that encompasses the class of animals. Whether it is really helpful to depict this kind of “sharing” as a “human-animal” relationship is a moot point, given that the “animal” in question is self-evidently a categorical representation on the part of the hunter rather than an empirical animal encountered in the hunt.</p>
         <p>In sum, the hunter’s relationship with the Spirit does not, despite appearances, qualify as a personal relationship with animals but rather represents an impersonal or categorical (“formal” in Hinde’s terms) relationship with them. But this still leaves open the possibility that the hunter may form a personal relationship with the animal itself in the course of the hunt. To determine whether this is the case, we need now to examine just what kind of human-animal interaction or association arises in the hunt.</p>

         <title>The Hunt</title>
         <p>Central to the hunting-as-sharing thesis is the proposition that the hunter gets to know the animals in essentially the same way that he gets to know other people:<disp-quote>
               <p>To know someone is to be in a position to approach him directly with a fair expectation of the likely response, to be familiar with that person’s past history and sensible to his tastes, moods and idiosyncrasies. You get to know other human persons by sharing with them, that is by experiencing their companionship. And if you are a hunter you get to know animals by hunting. (Ingold 1994:16)</p>
            </disp-quote>Ingold is claiming that hunting is a process whereby prey animals come to assume the status of familiar persons in a way similar to that in which other people stand as familiar persons on the basis of a history of shared interaction.</p>
         <p>Ingold argues that in the course of the hunt, hunters experience animals as persons similar to human persons:<disp-quote>
               <p>In short, animals do not participate with humans <italic>qua</italic> persons only in a domain of virtual reality, as represented within culturally constructed, intentional worlds, superimposed upon the naturally given substratum of organism-environment interactions. They participate as real-world creatures endowed with powers of feeling and autonomous action, whose characteristic behaviours, temperaments and sensibilities one gets to know in the very course of one’s everyday practical dealings with them. In this regard, dealing with non-human animals is not fundamentally different from dealing with fellow humans. (Ingold 1996:136)</p>
            </disp-quote>In response to this claim, let us address the issue of hunter knowledge of hunted animals.</p>
         <p>Hunters certainly get to know prey animals generically. In the course of his hunting career, the hunter is likely to hunt many individuals belonging to the same species. In the process, he will, at the level of the species, build up an extensive empirical knowledge of how this type of animal behaves in the context of the hunt: the kind of terrain in which it is to be found, the kind of tracks and other signs it leaves behind, its degree of sensitivity to signs of human presence, its response when sighted or pursued, and so on. The greater his experience in hunting this type of animal, the more extensive and useful this knowledge becomes. The veteran hunter is one who can draw on a rich stock of categorical knowledge about the behavior patterns of the target species, which stands him in good stead to react to the situations that arise in the course of a hunt. This accumulation of knowledge about categories of prey is one of the reasons why hunting return rates tend to peak later in a hunter’s life (Walker et al. 2002:640). Here we can recall Hinde’s second kind of relationship, based on serial interaction with different individuals belonging to the same category, which he calls a “formal” relationship. This sort of categorical knowledge of animals clearly can and does develop in hunting.</p>
         <p>The hunting-as-sharing thesis is not, however, concerned with this kind of knowledge of and relationship with animals. For Ingold, the hunter draws on a personal knowledge of prey animals. Indeed, he argues that this personalized orientation to the hunt is culturally mandated by a distinctive hunter-gatherer “economy of knowledge” that contrasts with the “Western anthropological” economy of knowledge (Ingold 2000:46–47). But there is, in fact, a crucial slippage here between human and animal referents: hunter-gatherers get to know—establish a relationship with—other people in particular, but it is difficult to conceive of hunters getting to know animals in particular. Hunted animals cannot be familiar persons in anything like the way fellow band members can be. There are a number of reasons for this.</p>
         <p>First, compared with band members, hunter and prey share neither time nor space. The nature of the hunt is such that for most of the time, hunter and prey are physically some distance apart from one another. From the hunter’s perspective, the prey animal is absent for almost the entire duration of the hunt. Of course, this animal absence is not absolute. There are tracks or other signs of an earlier presence that the animal leaves behind. Tracking is typically a protracted phase of separation that ideally for the hunter is gradually reduced as the spoor is followed, the trail determined, and the distance from the hunted animal shortened. Hunters are often skilled trackers who learn a lot about the animal from its spoor (Lee 1984:47–48; Liebenberg 1990, chap. 6). The level of proficiency of some trackers has even led to the suggestion that the track is, in fact, a kind of connection between hunter and animal (Brown 1999; Low 2007:S75–S76). This may be right in some cases, yet it should not be exaggerated. In general, on account of the difficulty of the terrain, the uneven quality of the tracks, and the time that has elapsed since the tracks were made, tracking tends to be a rather hit-and-miss affair.</p>
         <p>Nor is this state of separation easily overcome. On top of the unreliability of the trail, the hunter is up against the highly developed elusiveness of the prey animal. The animal’s vigilance toward and fear-driven avoidance of the hunter means that any degree of hunter proximity to the animal will have been hard earned. The hunter knows that the animal’s sensory capacity to detect him is likely to outstrip his ability to approach it. In order to get within range of the prey animal without being detected, the hunter must be proficient in the art of self-concealment. Yet even for the most skilful of hunters, such an approach remains a challenge because of the animal’s own finely honed capacity for self-concealment. Referring to what amounts to a battle of the senses in the hunting ground, Richard Nelson reflects on his own experience at deer hunting as follows: “Both the deer and I strive to conceal ourselves, as we also try to break through the other’s concealment” (Nelson 1997:336). The skilled hunter may prevail, provided that he takes his chance if and when it comes. But the window of opportunity is likely to be momentary at best. All too often, the animal remains frustratingly out of view and the hunter does not even get the chance to shoot. The animal may not be all that far away, but it is far enough to keep safe as long as it denies the hunter a sighting. Hunting is an odd sort of “encounter” in this respect, as the prey animal is generally at one remove from the hunter.</p>
         <p>Let us assume that the hunter can determine the species identity of the animal from its spoor. This allows him to invoke his wider categorical knowledge of the species, containing information on general patterns of behavior relevant to the hunt (speed of movement, propensity to seek water, preference for cover, sensitivity to hunter approach, and so on) that he has acquired from hunting that type of animal in the past and from observing and talking to other hunters. But what the hunter cannot do is draw on any prehunt knowledge of this particular animal in the course of his pursuit. Knowledgeable as he may be in terms of the kind of animal he is pursuing, even the veteran hunter remains fundamentally ignorant of the actual animal he comes across on a given hunt. His quarry is, qua individual, simply unknown to him. Encountering one another for the first time, hunter and hunted are literally strangers. What the hunt, as an event, simply does not allow is for the hunter to build up a “file” on the individual animal he happens to come across.</p>
         <p>Despite his stock of categorical knowledge of the species he is hunting, the hunter’s ignorance of the prey animal as an individual may well limit his effectiveness, because he cannot adapt his tactics to its idiosyncratic behavior. Louis Liebenberg makes this point in relation to Kalahari hunters:<disp-quote>
               <p>The prey animal is expected to do its best to avoid the hunters, using the strength and intelligence characteristic of its species. While the hunter expects to overcome the difficulties that challenge his own skill and cunning (such as the animal’s behaviour and other circumstances), there is always the possibility of being outwitted or otherwise frustrated by the individual animal’s idiosyncratic behaviour. Some animals are said to be ingenious in the ways they outwit the hunter. Others, who do not conform to the customs of the species, are said to be stupid. (Liebenberg 1990:86)</p>
            </disp-quote>Even the best hunter under the most favorable conditions can be thwarted by the behavioral unpredictability of the specific animal he is hunting.</p>
         <p>At this point, we should acknowledge certain objections that could be made to my account of the restricted character of the hunt as a form of association. The first objection might be that hunts are sometimes extended affairs that potentially allow the hunter to get to know a lot about the individual animal he is hunting. This may well seem a plausible objection. The literature on hunting certainly contains examples of such protracted hunts (e.g., Lee 1984:48). Hunting may include days of tracking, an initial violent encounter that wounds the animal, the continued pursuit of the now wounded animal, and even the driving of the wounded, debilitated animal to a location where it could be more easily retrieved (Laughlin 1968:309). Such a hunt can span days and involve a number of encounters, each of which, save perhaps for the final dispatch, triggers flight in the animal. In this situation, one clearly would expect the hunter to build up a firsthand knowledge of the hunted animal: tracking the animal (before sighting), stalking the animal (that can be sighted at a distance), shooting the animal and seeing its reaction, and tracking or pursuit of the now wounded animal. One would expect this sort of extended hunt to lead to an accumulation of knowledge by the hunter of the animal being hunted. The longer the pursuit, the greater the degree of hunter familiarization with the animal, to the point where what began as generic hunting becomes “customized” or fine-tuned hunting. At this point, the protracted hunt may come to resemble a social relationship based on serial interaction. Here we can recall that Hinde’s own recognition that “a prolonged interaction takes on some properties of a relationship” (Hinde 1987:24). The extended hunt may approximate a relationship.</p>
         <p>However, even in a protracted hunt, which is clearly more than a momentary encounter with the animal, the hunter’s connection with the animal is hardly comparable to the kind of sociality described among members of the hunter-gatherer band. For when the hunter does manage to detect an animal, pursue it, and finally corner and kill it, the encounter is with an animal in extremis—a highly stressed animal fugitive that is desperate to resist such life-threatening “contact” with a human predator. The hunter simply does not have the opportunity to observe the wild animal in a rounded way because of the animal’s aversion to his presence. The hunter can know the wild animal only in a highly partial, one-dimensional way. This is evident from an anecdote reported by Washburn and Lancaster in the <italic>Man the Hunter</italic> book:<disp-quote>
               <p>In game reserves many different kinds of animals soon learn not to fear man, and they no longer flee. James Woodburn took a Hadza into the Nairobi Park, and the Hadza was amazed and excited, because although he had hunted all his life, he had never seen such a quantity and variety of animals close at hand. His previous view of animals was the result of his having been their enemy, and they had reacted to him as the most destructive carnivore. In the park the Hadza hunter saw for the first time the peace of the herbivorous world. (Washburn and Lancaster 1968:299)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>A second objection to my account of the hunt as a restricted encounter might be that repeat encounters are possible and that hunting can therefore span more than one interaction. Repeated attempts to hunt specific animals are certainly conceivable and have indeed been reported. One only has to think of the repeated attempts to catch man-eating predators in colonial Africa and Asia (Corbett 1944; Hodges-Hill 1992) or “outlaw” wolves in the American West (Fischer 1995:18–19; Lopez 1995:188–192). The pursuit of these notorious animals in some cases spanned many years, in the course of which a certain knowledge of the particular animal’s behavior could be built up. Of course, this kind of “bounty hunt” is hardly a typical form of hunting and in any case has little to do with hunter-gatherers. But even among the latter we should acknowledge that, given that hunters often limit their hunting to particular known areas and that prey animals have set home ranges, it would not be that unusual for a hunter to come across the trail of an animal he had followed before. The possibility of repeat encounters between a hunter and a particular animal cannot, therefore, be ruled out.</p>
         <p>In practice, however, “sequel” encounters are highly unlikely. The hunter would need to acquire sufficient information about the animal on each occasion in order to identify it as the same animal. But in most unsuccessful hunts, hunters simply do not get to know enough about the animal that avoided them or escaped from them to link it to a past hunt or to recognize it in a future one. Even if he were to come across the trail of the same animal again, the hunter would not necessarily realize that it was a repeat encounter either because of the poor quality of the tracks or because he had not managed to get close enough to the animal first time around to sight it clearly. In the absence of any real awareness on the part of the hunter that it is the same animal, the earlier episode counts for little and cannot carry over and make a difference to the present hunt. As Hinde points out, a relationship effect arises only where one recognizes the identity of the other in both past and present interactions—only then can the former affect the latter (Hinde 1979:16).<sup>3</sup> Where this condition is not met, the hunter will pursue the animal as though it were for the first time, treating it as a stranger.<sup>4</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Encounters between strangers can lead to a longer-lasting association. The first-time encounter, insofar as it allows the parties to spend time together and observe one another at close quarters, often generates a rudimentary familiarity, which can form the basis of a subsequent relationship. Yet it remains the case that hunting measures up poorly in this regard. The hunter may devote many hours to hunting, but he does not, of course, tend to spend a lot of time with the animal he is hunting. If the hunt is a “joint activity,” it is not one that actually brings together the main parties—hunter and hunted—for any length of time. If the hunt fails and the animal quarry preemptively flees or hides before the hunter has a chance to approach it, the two sides may spend no time together at all. The prey animal is, after all, typically a human-averse animal that activates its suite of antipredator behaviors when hunted. But even if the hunt succeeds, the time of direct encounter is still likely to be minimal. The hunter has no interest in spending time in the company of the living animal; his purpose is normally to dispatch the animal as soon as it comes within range of his weapon.</p>
         <p>The hunt works on the basis of the relative separation of the two parties, a separation that is gradually reduced and ultimately replaced by a proximity that enables the hunter to make the kill. In a classic paper on hunting, William Laughlin pointed out that once an animal has been sighted, “attention then shifts to getting as close to the animal as necessary for an effective shot” (Laughlin 1968:308), adding that “getting close to an animal represents the major investment of the primitive hunter” (Laughlin 1968:309). Only by mastering the art of self-concealment would the hunter be able to make a stealthy approach to the prey animal (Nelson 1997:93). However, this ultimate proximity between hunter and hunted represents a peculiar form of “contact” that barely qualifies as association. For one thing, the self-concealment practiced by the stalking hunter may well be such that the animal never even sees the hunter until it is too late. Even if there is mutual detection, this will not last long. The eventual moment of full encounter tends to be the moment when the hunt ends—either in dispatch by the hunter or in the flight of the animal. Proximity signals the beginning of the end of the hunt rather than the beginning of an intimate human-animal association. In this sense, the “encounter” phase of the hunt is fleeting and momentary. It may be a long time in coming, but when it does arrive it is over in an instant. As a human-animal “interaction,” the hunt contains a built-in self-terminating mechanism that precludes the emergence of any appreciable familiarity between the principals, let alone the kind of “consociation” ascribed to the hunter-gatherer band.</p>
         <p>We should at this point address a claim that is sometimes made by proponents of the hunting-as-sharing thesis about this moment of encounter between hunter and hunted animal. This is that the animal behaves in a way that conforms with the notion of autodonation. Thus, in connection with Cree hunting of caribou, Tim Ingold points out that while the caribou may flee initially, at a certain point, “instead of running away it stands stock still, turns its head and stares you squarely in the face,” allowing the hunter to shoot it (Ingold 2000:13). He adds that “[it is at this] moment of encounter, when the animal stands its ground and looks the hunter in the eye, that the offering is made” (Ingold 2000:13). Paul Nadasdy has made a similar argument, recounting an experience he had snaring rabbits during his fieldwork in the Kluane First Nation in the Yukon. The rabbit was snared, then escaped (though with the snare still tight around its neck), but later appeared at Nadasdy’s cabin, where he easily killed it, leading him to conclude—in line with the beliefs of his informants—that “the rabbit came looking for me, that it quite literally gave itself to me” (Nadasdy 2007:36). He added that such animal behavior is “inexplicable from within a Euro-American view of the world” (Nadasdy 2007:36).</p>
         <p>Should we therefore acknowledge that the hunt can be a more significant face-to-face encounter than I have suggested above? What if, short-lived as it is, the quality of the eventual encounter is such that the animal appears to be offering itself to the hunter? Might the overall pursuit of the animal somehow be trumped by this moment of apparent autodonation? The problem, of course, is that such moments, to the extent they do actually arise, are at odds with other phases of the hunt as well as untypical of the behavior of hunted animals generally. Indeed, it is precisely because they are exceptional that they are remarkable. To suggest that such episodes underpin the belief in autodonation begs the question of why the much more common hunter experience of animal avoidance or flight from the hunter does not give rise to opposite belief. But the basic objection to this kind of argument would be that such a momentary encounter counts for little as far as the standard of sociality represented by the hunter-gatherer band is concerned. The members of the band do not bond with each other on the basis of ephemeral face-to-face encounters. In sum, despite the face-to-face contact that may occur between them, hunter and animal are still strangers when the kill takes place.</p>
         <p>The hunter can therefore get to know prey animals only in general. Although a hunter’s knowledge of prey animals can increase over time through the accumulation of hunting experience, he cannot get to know animals as individuals in the way that he can get to know other people as individuals, through experience of interacting with them over the long term. The conditions of the hunt simply rule out the development of personal relationships (based on serial interaction) between hunter and the individual animals pursued. The hunter’s knowledge of the animal is a general knowledge of the species based on piecemeal experiences involving the different individual animals he has come across over the course of his hunting career. Although his knowledge may be continuous and overarching with respect to the species, it is discontinuous and fragmentary with respect to individual animals. If the hunter does have a relationship with the hunted animal, it is a categorical or “formal” relationship rather than a personalized one, the polar opposite of the intimate relationships forged in the hunter-gatherer band.<sup>5</sup>
         </p>
         <p>As the hunter cannot get to know real animals personally (because he hunts them), he must rely on a categorical knowledge based on animal type. Writers on the topic of categorical thinking emphasize its convenience as a shortcut to social knowledge when there is simply not the time or opportunity to acquire a detailed knowledge of other people as individuals. “The power of categorical thinking resides in the fact that this information can be generated without the necessity of extended social interaction with the target. … Instead, mere categorization of the individual is sufficient to extract associated material from semantic memory” (Macrae, Mitchell, and Pendry 2002:187, reference removed). In a “challenging social environment,” we have little option but to make use of categories to “simplify and streamline the demands of the person perception process” (Macrae and Bodenhausen 2001:242). I would suggest that a similar rationale applies to the use of categorical thinking in the hunt. The nature of the hunt as a spatiotemporal event creates a vacuum as far as any personal relationship between hunter and hunted animal is concerned, one that is then filled by formal understandings of the relationship. Lacking access to optimal individualized knowledge of the animal, the hunter is forced to rely on suboptimal categorical knowledge.</p>

      <sec id="sc6">
         <title>Personal Relationships with Domesticated Animals</title>
         <p>Let us return to the question of society beyond humanity with which we began. Proponents have argued that it is among hunters that we should look for “social relations … [that] override the boundaries of species” (Ingold 1997:242). For the reasons set out above, I question whether there is a personal relationship—as opposed to a formal relationship—between hunter and hunted animal. But if hunting falls short in this way, does it mean that the notion of human-animal cosociality must be discarded as well? Or are there other human-animal associations that might more convincingly demonstrate the existence of cross-species personal relationships? I argue below that there are.</p>
         <p>Domesticated animals are much more promising candidates as far as human-animal cosociality is concerned. For the purposes of this article, I employ a conventional definition of “domesticated animal” that denotes a situation of captive taming that makes possible controlled breeding (cf. Bökönyi 1969:219). As a human-animal association, the key feature of the domesticated animal is its tameness—that is, its acceptance of a human presence and of some degree of human handling. The combination of captivity and tameness creates a context of association very different from that of hunting. Human interactions with domesticated animals represent spatiotemporal events fundamentally different from the encounters with prey animals in the hunt. A new quality of interaction with people becomes possible for animals that have shed their fear of humans as potential predators. Human minders and domesticated animals can form relationships that consist of a series of regular interactions that potentially build on one another in a cumulative way, such that later interactions acquire a depth and quality lacking in earlier ones. The relationship emerges through a history of interactions and attendant familiarization.</p>
         <p>African herders provide examples of such relationships based on daily interaction and a detailed knowledge of the individual members of the herd. Edward Evans-Pritchard has famously described the intimate daily interactions between Nuer and their cattle, including milking them, cleaning the kraal, decorating their horns, removing ticks from their bodies, petting them, and leading them round the camp in the mornings and evenings (Evans-Pritchard 1940, chap. 1). For the Nuer, cattle are “intimate companions from birth to death” (Evans-Pritchard 1953:181). The herder’s individuated relationship to and knowledge of the animals of the herd contributes to management, as the herder can draw on his knowledge of the temperaments and positional preferences of particular animals within the herd (as it moves or grazes) in day-to-day husbandry and herding tasks (Galaty 1989; Lott and Hart 1979). In an article titled “Cowmanship,” Martin Seabrook characterizes stockmanship as “knowing the individual behaviour of every animal in one’s charge, and having the ability to recognize small changes in the behaviour of any animal or all the animals collectively” (Seabrook 1977:5). In contrast to a standardized approach to the animals of the herd, the ideal of “empathetic stockmanship” holds that the stockman should be able to recognize the temperaments of the different animals and respond to “the individual requirements of individual animals” (Seabrook and Bartle 1992:122–124).</p>
         <p>Another close human-animal relationship is that involving working animals—in what Clifton Bryant has referred to as the “human-animal work team” (Bryant 1992:22). Examples of this kind of relationship include hunter and dog (Ellen 1999:63), cowboy and horse (Lawrence 1984:60), shepherd and wether (Tani 1989), mahout and elephant (Hart 2005:184), circus trainer and performing animal (Kiley-Worthington 1990:134–135), and fruit grower and crop-picking monkey (Sponsel, Natadecha-Sponsel, and Ruttanadakul 2004). These are instrumental and often extremely hierarchical relationships, in which the human handler has power of command over the animal and reinforces this authority by the use of punishment, albeit in conjunction with rewards. But the fact remains that the often impressive degree of physical coordination that emerges between the two individuals as they undertake the task in question is based on a high level of mutual awareness developed through an association typically begun early in the animal’s life and spanning years.</p>
         <p>Mention must also be made of the personal relationships that commonly develop with household pets (Mendl and Harcourt 2000:50–51; Sanders 1999; Smuts 2001:302–306). As the term “companion animal” suggests, this is a human-animal association in which much time is normally spent together. For the pet, the connection with the human pet owner is likely to be a lifelong one consisting of a daily round of shared activities, both structured and unstructured. As time passes, this regular contact often forms the basis of a deep familiarity that is manifested in dyadically customized interactions or “rituals” (Smuts 2001:303–304). The longer the association lasts, the larger “the circle of shared experience” and with it the greater the degree of “mutual attunement” (Smuts 2001:304, 306). By virtue of their shared biographical history, the two parties come to know each other as individuals rather than types (cf. Shapiro 1997:294–295). In the process, there develops an attachment between them that is expressed in terms such as “member of the family” and “friend” that are applied to the pet (Arluke and Sanders 1996:10–12; Beck and Katcher 1996, chap. 3; Serpell 1996:106–107). The extent of this relationship finds further expression in the grief and sense of bereavement commonly experienced by the pet owner upon the death of the pet (Archer and Winchester 1994; Beck and Katcher 1996, chap. 10; McNicholas and Collis 1995).</p>
         <p>The hunt, by its nature, does not allow this kind of process to occur. Tim Ingold has famously argued that “trust” is a feature of the hunt, but in fact what is striking about hunting is the elemental mistrust that disposes the animal to avoid contact with the hunter. Even where the hunter manages to close the gap with the animal and achieve a measure of “contact,” his inclination is to seize the opportunity and dispatch the animal rather than try and associate directly with it. In passing, we should recognize that the latter is a theoretical possibility: even if it provokes animal flight, fragile first contact between a human and a human-averse wild animal can still form the first small step in a protracted familiarization process that ultimately leads to a degree of animal tolerance of human presence. This kind of association, known as “habituation,” is, after all, the basis of the field methodology of many a zoologist (Mech 1988; Moss 1996; Williamson and Feistner 2003). But the hunter, of course, is not in the business of promoting the habituation of the animals he hunts, still less in bonding with them. He simply wants to kill them in order to procure meat and the other resources they can supply.</p>
         <p>At this point the following objection might be made. Hunter-gatherers do sometimes keep the young of animals killed in the hunt. This practice of what might be called juvenile live capture is widely reported (Erikson 2000; Galton 1865; Serpell 1996, chap. 4). These young animals are raised by the hunter and his family. They are fed, watered, affectionately handled, played with, and protected by their human carers, who are often women and children. The association can last years, although the animals may well be confined or discarded as they mature and become difficult to handle (Cormier 2002:73–74; Shepard 2002:110). They rarely breed and so do not constitute domesticated animals (according to the conventional definition given above), and new individuals have to be recurrently recruited from the hunt. But on account of their tameness and the longevity of their association with family members, these animals clearly do form personal relationships with humans. The captive taming of juvenile animals makes possible an extended series of interactions that makes for personal relationships comparable with those described for Western pet keeping above. The existence of such hunt-facilitated pet keeping among hunter-gatherers might seem, on the face of it, to call into question the argument advanced in this article.</p>
         <p>My response would be to point out that these intimate human-animal associations in themselves have little to do with hunting. The animals may be procured through the hunt, but once they are captured alive and brought back to camp, they cease to be prey animals and become quasi family members. To argue that hunter-gatherer pet keeping has to be understood in relation to hunting would be like saying that modern pet keeping in urban-industrial societies has to be understood in relation to shopping because many pets are obtained through purchase. But this would be to miss the key feature of pet keeping as a form of human-animal association. The association between pet and pet keeper may be initiated by an act of purchase, but the status of the animal is then transposed to something other than a commodity—hence, the aforementioned designation of the pet as a member of the family. Similarly, with hunter-gatherers, the animal acquired through the hunt is subsequently inserted into a wholly different context of association. This transformation in status is indicated by the fact that while its conspecifics in the wild continue to be caught and eaten, the individual pet is not considered edible (Serpell 1996:63–64; Shepard 2002:110). It is not a living store of meat in a transitional state between live capture and eventual consumption. Its personal relationship with the human carer arises because the animal has been removed from the sphere of hunting in which it originated.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>This article has critically evaluated what I have called the hunting-as-sharing thesis—the claim that hunter-gatherers view hunting as similar to sharing within the band and see prey animals as belonging to a common sphere of personalized sociality. We have seen that the two areas of hunter-gatherer sociality, human-human and human-animal, which are supposed to be similar in character, instead turn out to be fundamentally different. One involves relationships with individuals, the other a relation to a class. When Ingold discusses the hunter-gatherer band, he describes an intimate and durable sociality between real individuals who share space and time. Humans enter into relationships with particular other humans, and the uniqueness of a relationship is fashioned by the shared history between the two individuals. Yet when he discusses the human-animal “sociality” of the hunt, the “personalized relationship” is no longer between real sentient individuals but between a human individual (a hunter) and a class of animals (corresponding to the Spirit). In other words, while human-human sociality inheres in interindividual sentient encounters that extend serially over time, the human-animal “sociality” of the hunt does not. Although specific people in the hunting band have personal relationships with specific other people, they cannot have commensurable personal relationships with the specific animals they hunt. To the extent that there is an encounter in the hunt, it is an anonymous one. At most, there is a representation of a personal relationship with an anthropomorphic Spirit who “owns” the whole class of animal conspecifics. There are direct one-to-one relationships among humans, but only an indirect one-to-many relation between humans and animals.</p>
         <p>This article has also reanalyzed the hunt as a form of human-animal association, drawing on biologist Robert Hinde’s model of relationships. I have argued that the nature of hunting precludes the existence of personal relationships between hunters and hunted animals that are comparable to either those found among members of the hunter-gatherer band or those between humans and domesticated animals. I do not deny that hunting is represented as sharing, but I do challenge the claim that this is an understanding that arises out of the hunt itself. On the one hand, the hunted animals are not party to any such sharing arrangement. Hunters know all too well that they are dealing with an animal that actively resists the hunt rather than passively submits to it. The practical truth of the hunt is that the life of the hunted animal is not something “given” by the animal but something that has to be taken by the hunter. The hunter knows from experience that hunting is something done to rather than with the animals hunted. On the other hand, the conditions of the hunt are such that hunters are unable to experience actual hunted animals as partners in a personal relationship. The hunter’s relationship with the “Spirit” figure, which has a quasi-proprietorial relation to the animals as a whole, may be superimposed onto each hunt, but it cannot abolish the dynamics of the hunt as a spatiotemporal event. If it applies at all, the notion of hunting-as-sharing applies at a cosmological rather than an experiential level.</p>
         <p>If this is the case, then we should recognize that logically, “hunting-as-sharing” does not mean that sharing somehow replaces killing but rather that sharing coexists with killing, albeit at different levels—that is, the killing of animals at one level and the sharing of these animals with the Spirit at another. When the hunt is viewed in generic terms, the deaths of individual animals recede from view. The effect of this representation is to expurgate from the hunt the basic disposition of the hunted animal. The animal is, as it were, subsumed in the larger relationship between hunter and Spirit. The individual animal hunted thus connects with the sharing process not as itself one of the active sharing parties but rather as that which is passively shared between the two sharing parties (hunter and Spirit). As a subject of the sharing relationship, the individual animal is effectively absent.</p>
         <p>In reality, the sentient animal does exist as an intrinsic part of the hunt. It makes its recalcitrant agency felt when it evades the hunter and thwarts his best efforts to catch it. Even when the hunter does succeed, it is the extent of the animal’s resistance against which the hunter’s achievement in catching it tends to be measured. But this connection between them through the hunt has nothing to do with sociality. The animal’s agency is expressed not in its ability to enter into a relationship with the hunter but, as it were, in its ability to avoid such a relationship in the first place. Even when the hunter does make the kill and turns his hitherto limited association with the animal into direct control over its body, socially this is an act of closure, which ends the association. The successful hunt ends not just the life of the animal but also any possibility of a personal relationship with it. There are many human-animal associations that merit recognition as examples of cross-species sociality, but hunting is not one of them.</p>
