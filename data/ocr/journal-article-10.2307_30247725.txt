Mabel Street Tucson, AZ 85705 and Department of Anthropology University of Arizona Tucson, AZ 85721 ABSTRACT This article describes a distinctive rock-art site in the Pedregosa Mountains of southeast Arizona. The more than 200 black representational elements do not conform to any of the various rock-art styles that have been described for the Southwest. Description of the design motifs, environmental setting, and artifacts provides information for tentative interpretations regarding cultural affiliation, function, and age of the pictographs. INTRODUCTION Rock art, from the caves of Lascaux, France, to more recent American In- dian drawings, illustrates what Bunzel (1938:535) has called the "antiquity and universality of art." While perhaps more durable than most forms of primitive art, rock art is nevertheless fragile and subject to decay through erosion and vandalism. Known rock-art sites in the mountains of southeast Arizona on Coronado National Forest lands have been documented to preserve a record of this art (Burton 1988). One of these sites, Tom Ketchum Cave, contains over 200 black zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, and other elements and is one of the most elaborate rock-art sites recorded in southeastern Arizona. An analysis of the Tom Ketchum Cave pictographs provides information about their style, cultural affiliation, and function. SETTING Tom Ketchum Cave (AZ FF:07:03 [ASM], AR 03-05-01-12 [FS]) is lo- cated along Tom Ketchum Canyon Creek in the Pedregosa Mountains of south- east Arizona, 20 miles northeast of the town of Douglas (Figure 1). The canyon is narrow and steep-walled. However, at the cave's location, the eastern cliff has receded from the creek and forms a sort of amphitheater. Tom Ketchum Cave is the largest of several caves and rockshelters formed by irregularities in the rhyolitic rock cliff that are accessible by a steep talus slope. The cave is at an elevation of 5,600 feet; the vicinity is characterized by oak-juniper wood- 335</page><page sequence="2">336 BURTON Safford lb 1 501701 5T .... A BURRS MTNS .......

While the creek is ephemeral, several hundred feet below the cave, in the canyon bottom, is a small tinaja fed by a natural seep. The cave includes a large room, approximately 5 m deep, 5-9.5 m wide, and from 3-9 m high, and an ad- jacent smaller alcove, approximately 2 m wide and 3 m deep (Figure 2). Be- cause of its southern exposure and large entrance, the cave is naturally well-lit. Most of the pale brown to gray wall surfaces are smooth but jointed; some ex- foliation and vesicles occur. Water stains cover small portions of the walls and there is also smoke blackening, especially on the walls of the smaller alcove. Cave fill, which may be over a meter deep near the front of the cave, is com- posed of fine sediments with some rock. Several holes in the floor, apparently from pot hunting, are approximately 30 cm deep. Artifacts include a few flakes of volcanic rock (basalt and rhyolite), a few small burned bone fragments, and numerous cane reed fragments. Other artifacts may be obscured by the ubiqui-</page><page sequence="3">Rock Art 337 sloping 12 Bedrock S14 i y Sloping Bedrock 13 19 \ 15 rocky 10 ** 16 1820 7 17 "y.221 o-overhong 22 -e Bedrock 2 0.

One reed cigarette was collected from the cave in 1965 (Arizona State Museum Catalog number A-30,183). The presence of recent trash, in- cluding flash cubes, cigarettes, and historic graffiti, indicates the cave is still visited and that other prehistoric artifacts may have been collected. THE ART The pictographs occur in groups and as isolated glyphs. Although some figures are found more than 3 m above the cave floor, the slightly sloping</page><page sequence="4">338 BURTON Figure 3. Overview of main pictograph concentration showing Panels 13, 16, 17, and 19 (from left to right). wall may have facilitated access. Almost all pictographs are made of a dense char- coal based black pigment. A few white and gray elements (possibly of an ash- based pigment), similar in form but smaller than the black elements, are on the edge of the wall dividing the two rooms and on the southeastern wall near the cave entrance. The pictographs occur in a wide range of shades and states of preservation, suggesting that they were not all painted at the same time (Figure 3). More than 200 elements were recorded by a combination of photography and tracing. A slide was taken of each panel or figure; the slide was then pro- jected onto paper and the figures traced. This method has two advantages over traditional tracing, sketching, or photography alone. First, it reduces the possi- bility of damage to the rock art because no taping of plastic or paper to the rock surface is needed. Second, it is much faster (a decided advantage at remote sites with many elements) and allows for more accurate renditions of the fig- ures than direct tracing or sketching. The slide-traced figures were later field-checked against the original pic- tographs. Fifteen figures could not be recorded through photography because they were either too faint or positioned at an angle that would cause distortion. These were traced on mylar sheets. Nearly all of the elements (Table 1) are representational zoomorphs (75%) or anthropomorphs (13%). Large animals are all depicted in profile; of these, all but one are rendered with solid bodies (rather than simply outlined).

Figures with backward-curving horns were further identified as bighorn sheep (Figure 4), and those with branching antlers as deer (Figure 5). Judging by the size of some of the antlers, elk may also have been the intended subject. However, some of the ungulate figures have unnaturally long tails or horns.</page><page sequence="6">338 BURTON Table 1. Tabulation of motifs.

Depictions of dogs: (A) Panel 17 (upper figure is 32 cm long); (B) Panel 16 (17 cm long); Quadrupeds with relatively short legs, multiple toes, or long bodies, and lacking bifurcated feet or horns, were classified as carnivores. Four of these, distinct for their long, big jaws and lack of necks, appear to be canines (three of these are shown in Figure 6). The apparent "motion" of these figures seems canine-like and, together with their placement among game animals (Figure 7), suggests that dogs played an integral role in hunting (see especially Grant et al. 1968). Eleven figures were classified as mountain lions. These have long tails, relatively long bodies, and short legs (Figure 8). The indeterminate zoomorph class includes 27 figures that could not be further identified; five of these, with four to eight legs, appear to be depicted in plan view (Figure 9). The anthropomorphs vary not only in size, ranging from 13 cm to 65 cm, but also in form (Figure 10). Several have large round heads, thick torsos, and exaggerated fingers and toes. Natural small holes in the rhyolite form the eyes of one figure (Figure 10C); another has eyes and a mouth formed of a light-col- ored substance applied on top of the black paint (Figure 10H). Two have bows and arrows, and one of these is holding a dog (Figure 10H). Other representational elements include a possible botanical element (Fig- ure 7), ungulate tracks (Figure 8A), and a possible atlatl (Figure 9D). Geomet- ric elements include circles, a spiral, two rakes, two grids, and a possible reticulate. Numerous indistinct or partial elements that were not classifiable also occur. It is unclear how the elements were applied, but some, such as the small bow and arrow (Figure 10H) and small circles (Figure 7), are too fine to have been finger-painted, suggesting the use of a brush in some cases. The largest single figure is located in the smaller alcove (Figure 11). This</page><page sequence="9">Rock Art 343 large ungulate, 60 cm tall and 68 cm from nose to tail, is the only figure de- picted in outline rather than in solid black. It has a large, full body with a long (42 cm) arrow piercing its back. While the proportions of the large torso and relatively small legs and head suggest the appearance of a bovid, the branching antlers and short tail indicate that the figure is a deer. Perhaps the exaggeration of the body is purposeful to emphasize the economically significant portion (cf. Bunzel 1938:580). In addition to the prehistoric art, there is more recent work, which in- cludes 17 names, 24 initials, 13 dates (the earliest is 1911), and a drawing of I I i L ..

PROBLEMS IN ROCK-ART ANALYSIS Babcock (n.d.) has summarized several types or levels of analysis in the anthropological study of art: (1) description and classification, (2) stylistic analysis, (3) technological analysis, (4) social uses and cultural meanings, (5) communication and interaction, (6) structure or semiotics, (7) ethnosemantics or ethnoaesthetics, (8) producer or artist orientation, (9) acculturation, (10) politics of production and reproduction, and (11) performance or event orienta- tion. These levels, which can overlap, are often sequential in that description and classification usually precede the ascertainment and interpretation of social uses and cultural meanings. Most rock-art studies focus on description and classification (Schaafsma 1985), with some delving into technique and technology, and social uses and cultural meanings (e.g., Bettinger and Baumhoff 1982:493-495; Heizer and Baumhoff 1962; Wallace and Holmlund 1986). Other types of studies are more rare, for several reasons. First, few ethnographic data are available that pertain to rock art. Contemporary Indians often disavow knowledge of local rock art or its origin (Gunther 1968:112). Except for some examples among Pueblo groups (Michaelis 1981; Schaafsma 1981), rock art bears little resemblance to art forms historically or currently produced by native groups. Further, there is little theory to help bridge the gap between ethnographic and prehistoric art (Schaafsma 1985). Second, rock-art studies are hindered by poor chronological control. Rock-art dating often relies on element superpositioning, which provides only relative sequences, or the dating of nearby artifacts, which are often difficult to associate directly with the rock art itself. Other techniques, such as design studies or the re-patination of pecked surfaces, provide only gross temporal es- timates. Poor chronological control makes it difficult to determine the contem- poraneity of various styles or their changes over time. Finally, compiling a data base of rock art, even for description and clas- sification purposes, is difficult. The inaccessibility of many rock-art sites, which may have helped protect them from development and vandalism, makes it difficult to record them accurately and quickly. Rock art does offer some potential interpretive advantages over other forms of prehistoric art: it remains in physical, if not cultural, context; unlike exchange items, it occurs only within the territory or travel area of its maker; and it is easier to examine than more ephemeral art forms.</page><page sequence="11">RockArt 345 A 'i C D D f-y I E .vu,~1 Figure 8.

Because style may reflect a culture's world view (Kroeber 1963:126), a rock- art "style" might correspond to a prehistoric "culture" (e.g., Mogollon or Hohokam). However, bighorn sheep are a common rock-art subject throughout the West (Grant 1967). How likely is it that all depictions of bighorn sheep in Tom Ketchum Cave pertain exclusively to a single culture? Wobst (1977:328-330) suggests that material culture items seen by large segments of a society may contain distinctive features that broadcast cultural affiliation: the fact that potentially any or all members may be exposed to the stylistic message makes it much easier to fine-tune the stylistic signals so that they will either be uni- formly expressed throughout the entire group in question or show only random devia- tions around a norm. To the extent that rock art is "public" (Bruder 1983), it would meet Wobst's criterion. However, Tom Ketchum Cave might fit the definition of a "private" site because of its apparently remote location. If so, the Tom Ketchum rock art may have been viewed only by a small segment of the group that produced it. Newcomer (1979:223) points out that among the Pakot, men and women have different aesthetics, depending upon what each controls. Rock art produced by a single segment of a society may not exhibit the full range of elements nor- mally considered common at "public" sites (Geertz 1976). Nevertheless, it seems likely that art should show stylistic continuity within a culture. Hohokam "public" rock art has been shown to be replicated at small "private" sites, even though the complete range of elements common to the style might not be present (Bruder 1983). DATING The subjects of rock art sometimes provide chronological information (Weisbrod 1978). For example, the lack of horse figures, common in Apache rock art, and representations of other Euro-american items, suggests that the Tom Ketchum Cave pictographs are prehistoric. The bows and arrows depicted at the site indicate at least a post-A.D. 500 date, which was when the bow and arrow were introduced in the Southwest (Schaafsma 1980). Another figure (Figure 9D), a possible atlatl, suggests an earlier period of use. A common method of dating rock art considers the time period rep- resented by artifacts found in apparent association. None of the artifacts found in the cave itself are temporally diagnostic. However, a worked Mimbres Black-on-white bowl sherd was found in a small rockshelter less than 100 m</page><page sequence="14">348 BURTON away. This sherd disk may indicate use of the area sometime between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1130 (Cordell 1984:293), although the sherd may have been cu- rated or scavenged and deposited much later. REGIONAL ROCK-ART STYLES Several rock-art styles have been identified for southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. These include Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract, Gila Petroglyph, Mogollon Red, Jornada, Western Archaic, and Apache. Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract designs (Schaafsma 1980:49-55) may be rendered in yellow, red, orange, black, or white. Characteristic elements are short, parallel lines and zigzags; circles, dots, and abstract designs are also common. A few stick figures are sometimes depicted. Although the elements appear to be randomly placed, the style often includes an element that frames and unites each panel. Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract may date to the Ar- chaic period. Examples of this style have been recorded in southern New Mexico (Schaafsma 1980), the northern Chiricahua Mountains (Burton 1988), and further north (Rucks 1983). The Western Archaic tradition is a petroglyph style found throughout the greater Southwest. This style, which also dates to the Archaic period, includes two types of designs - one curvilinear and one that is a mixture of curvilinear and rectilinear designs. Schaafsma (1980:184), who refers to this tradition as Great Basin Abstract, reports its occurrence in mountains east of the Pedregosa and Chiricahua ranges. The Gila Petroglyph style (Schaafsma 1980:81-103), also referred to as the Hohokam style (Wallace and Holmlund 1986:82), includes both curvilinear abstract and representational elements, with representational figures constitut- ing 25% to 80% of the elements at larger sites. Schaafsma considers spirals a hallmark, as they are on Hohokam pottery, and finds the Gila Petroglyph style very consistent throughout its range. This style dates from A.D. 600-1450 in the Tucson Basin (Wallace and Holmlund 1986:107). No sites of the Gila Pet- roglyph style are known in the Pedregosa or Chiricahua mountains, although examples have been recorded in mountains to the north and west. The Mogollon Red pictograph style, also defined by Schaafsma (1980:187-196), consists of small elements in red, with the occasional use of white paint. The most common designs are wavy lines or zigzags, simple con- centric circles, and stick-figure humans. Schaafsma notes that although the Mogollon Red style is not well-dated, it may have persisted from about A.D. Figure 10.

Large deer on Panel 6 (68 cm long). 500 to A.D. 1250. This style is common throughout southeastern Arizona (Rucks 1983, 1986; Schaafsma 1980). Some Mogollon Red style sites in the Galiuro and Pinaleno mountains are located in settings similar to that of Tom Ketchum Cave (Burton 1988). The Jornada style (Schaafsma 1980:199-242) includes figures of masks, faces, large blanket designs, animals with bent legs, flying birds, and other representational figures. Schaafsma (1980:199) believes that the designs are clearly associated with Mimbres ceramics and includes petroglyphs as well as pictographs. Painted figures are usually red, although other colors occur. Humans, mammals, birds, and insects are represented; most are stylized to the point that further identification is not possible. Balanced static figures of animals with big heads and teeth are common. Recognizable animals include coyotes or dogs, sheep with horns, and mountain lions (sometimes spotted like jaguars) with long tails over their backs. Schaafsma notes the importance of mountain lions and jaguars in Pueblo ritual (1980:233). These motifs have not yet been reported for Hohokam rock art. Other motifs include "cloud terraces,"</page><page sequence="17">Rock Art 351 Figure 12. Possible self-portraits of father and son on Panel 5 (larger figure is 46 cm high). "mythical beings," "Tlaloc" designs, homed serpents, and a Mimbres version of Quetzalcoatl. The Jornada Style is widespread throughout south-central New Mexico and has been dated to A.D. 1000-1450 (Schaafsma 1980:184, 186). According to Schaafsma, no Jornada style sites are known in Arizona. However, Rucks (1983) notes a pictograph and a petroglyph site in the Gila River Valley that fits the Jornada style. In the Apache style (post-A.D. 1400), dry charcoal drawings are common (some pecked designs occur as well), although a range of colors are used. Ele- ments include horses and riders, bison, miscellaneous small unidentifiable ani- mals, stylized anthropomorphs, hour-glass shapes, and ray-headed figures. This style is found throughout the range of the Apache, with known sites con- centrated in south-central New Mexico. Schaafsma (1980:Map 11) notes three sites in southeastern Arizona - one in the Chiricahua Mountains - and others are known in the region (Burton 1988; Hartmann 1985; Rucks 1983). CULTURAL AFFILIATION The Tom Ketchum pictographs do not fall readily into any of the styles de- scribed above. They are closest to the Jornada and Gila Petroglyph/Hohokam styles in the depiction of animals. The bighorn sheep appear to be very similar</page><page sequence="18">352 BURTON in size, form, and color to sheep at Black Sheep Cave in the Tucson Basin (Hartmann 1985). The Black Sheep Cave examples, located well within the Hohokam range, may be part of a currently undefined Hohokam pictograph style. The lack of horse figures and Apache motifs suggests that they are pre- historic, and if their similarities with Tom Ketchum are more than coinciden- tal, the presence of a bow and arrow there indicates a post-Archaic origin. The narrow range of elements at each site (sheep and abstracts at Black Sheep Cave, and sheep, other animals, and anthropomorphs at Tom Ketchum) may reflect that both are "private" sites with specialized functions. There are, how- ever, enough differences to make this grouping only tentative: the Tucson Basin sheep generally lack details, such as bifurcated feet, and are accom- panied by abstract elements. The Tom Ketchum anthropomorph designs differ from Hohokam depic- tions, especially in the presence of eyes and mouths and in the lack of expanded mid-bodies (Henry Wallace, personal communication, 1987). Further, Hohokam rock art usually contains a large abstract component (Ferg 1979; Schaafsma 1980; Simpson and Wells 1984; Wallace 1983; Wallace and Holmlund 1986; White 1965) but the Tom Ketchum figures are overwhelm- ingly representational. At those few Hohokam rock-art sites that do contain a large representational component, the figures are predominantly an- thropomorphs. When compared to designs found on other items of material culture, the Tom Ketchum rock art seems to demonstrate more eastern influences. Figure 11, for example, is a deer that is much like one depicted on a Mimbres bowl (Tanner 1976:142, Figure 44n). The large, round heads of the anthropomorphs also resemble Mimbres designs (cf. Muench and Pike 1975:158). The large deer in Figure 11 is also similar to Jornada style figures (Schaafsma 1980:225). In general, the overwhelming number of representational elements, the amount of realism attempted in the depictions, the relatively large number of anthropomorphs, and the presence of mountain lion figures, suggest a Mimbres or Jornada affiliation or influence. The presence of a Mimbres Black- on-white sherd in a nearby cave provides further support for this inference. Mimbres sites have been noted west of the Pedregosa Mountains and in the San Simon Valley, just east of the Chiricahua Mountains (Sayles 1945:Fig. 1). However, the Tom Ketchum pictographs lack many of the elements common in Jornada rock art (e.g., masks, cloud terraces, mythical beings), and the an- thropomorphs and zoomorphs lack the embellishments common to the style (cf. Schaafsma 1980:199-240). The difficulty of firmly placing the Tom Ketchum pictographs into a style may reflect the cave's location in an area where the boundaries of the Hohokam and Mogollon overlap. As Bronitsky and Merritt (1986:169) point out, prehis- toric inhabitants of southeastern Arizona have been called Hohokam with</page><page sequence="19">Rock Art 353 Mogollon influence, Mogollon with Hohokam influence, and indigenous Dra- goon and Ootam with a Casas Grandes influence. Ferg et al. (1984:802-803) note that "sites grade from predominantly Hohokam to predominantly Mogol- ion with occasional pure site intrusions close to the other's 'heartland'." The Tom Ketchum pictographs appear to be a fusion of Hohokam and Mimbres influences into a distinctive rock-art style. Only one other possible example of the style - at Black Sheep Cave - is known. If the Black Sheep Cave location suggests a predominantly Hohokam origin for the style, the greater quantity and elaboration of figures at Tom Ketchum Cave, on the periphery of the Hohokam range, would seem anomalous. Perhaps Tom Ketchum Cave reflects the mixing of Hohokam and Mimbres traits seen in the Encinas phase (A.D. 900-1200) in the San Simon-San Pedro area (Bronitsky and Merritt 1986:190-191). FUNCTION The scant domestic artifact content and the remote location of Tom Ketchum Cave are attributes shared with other sites in the region. Sherd disks and cane cigarettes, as well as miniature bows and arrows, were found in the Winchester Mountains at a "hunting shrine" (Fulton 1941). The bundled sherd disks found there included Mimbres, Dragoon, El Paso, and Hohokam ceramics (Fulton 1941:15). In the Alamo Hueco Mountains, a cavern contain- ing a large number of cane tubes, pahos, arrows, a hunting net, snares, hair bundles, and a kachina was interpreted as a center for hunting ceremonies (Lambert and Ambler 1961). These sites, however, contain no rock art. Heizer and Baumhoff (1962), in a pioneering study in western Nevada, correlated rock-art designs with environmental data to infer a hunting-related function for most rock art in that area. Although the correlation between envi- ronment and rock art cannot be examined in this single case, the depiction of game animals, bows and arrows, and hunting animals (dogs and mountain lions) at Tom Ketchum Cave certainly suggests that hunting was on the minds of the artists. While the deer and sheep depicted were undoubtedly not the only important game animals, environmental conditions in Tom Ketchum Canyon would have been conducive to hunting these species. It may be speculative to extend a hunting "magic" interpretation to rock art (Ucko and Rosenfield 1977). Nevertheless, whether the Tom Ketchum pictographs represent hunting magic, other ceremonial functions, or doodling, hunting certainly was an im- portant theme. Another theme that may have been important to the artists is suggested by what could be self-portraits of a father and son hunting team (Figure 12). It consists of two adjacent figures: the smaller, slightly lower, less well-executed figure may have been drawn by a younger artist.

Although apparently the work of numerous artists, the subject matter and general form are consistent, which suggest that the Tom Ketchum pictographs could be grouped as a distinctive "style." Based on the cave's environmental setting, design motifs, and other material remains, the cave can be interpreted as a hunting shrine with both Mimbres and Hohokam influences. The art work tentatively dates to the Mimbres Classic period but a more precise chronological determination might be obtained through radiocarbon dating of the pigments themselves. Finally, because of the difficulty involved in locating and recording rock art, we cannot eliminate the possibility that more sites like Tom Ketchum Cave may yet be found in southeastern Arizona. Acknowledgments. All slides, mylar tracings, finished art work, and collected artifacts are curated at the Supervisors Office, Coronado National Forest, Tucson, Arizona. Partial funding for the work reported herein was provided by the Coronado National Forest as part of a Forest-wide con- tract for rock-art recording. I thank Dr. Patricia Spoerl, Forest Archaeologist, for her continued support. Mary M. Farrell of the Coronado National Forest provided invaluable technical assistance throughout this project. Mike Jacobs and Sharon Urban provided access to records and collections at the Arizona State Museum. Dr. Barbara Babcock suggested various approaches to the analysis of art, and provided bibliographic assistance and insight into the importance of art in non-western society. I also thank Mary M. Farrell, Henry Wallace, Polly Schaafsma, an anonymous reviewer, and the editor for their many helpful comments and criticisms. Of course, I assume full responsibil- ity for any errors of commission or omission. REFERENCES CITED Babcock, Barbara A. n.d. International Encyclopedia of Communication. Oxford University Press.
