<plain_text><page sequence="1">A DISCOURSE OF DESPAIR: The Semiology of Lonely-Hearts Language JEFFREY L. CRANE University of Hawaii at Hilo JOY MICHIE INO Makaloa Consultants Drawing upon the writings of Adorno, Barthes, and Gadamer, this essay exposes the popular lonely-hearts column as a form of modern discourse. Parallels are established between lonely-hearts ads and other forms of advertising, as well as between the lonely-heart ad and other forms of popular media (e.g., the astrology column). The ads themselves are placed within a modern discursive practice whereby technical and instrumental motives and designs are seen to dominate. The discursive practice that supports such ads is analyzed in terms of its instrumental and technical features and its illusory claim to straightforward speech. In The German Ideology, Karl Marx (1970) endeavored to reorient conventional thinking on alienation. Through his critique of Feuerbach, Hegel, and Stirner, he presented the notion of alienation as an historically conditioned phenomenon. In the Marxian ontology, alienation was no longer the inevitable fate of Being in the world. Whether alienation is self-imposed through human relations (perhaps not by design) or foisted upon the species from some external source, it is clear that the species has long raged and continues to rage against the conditions of its existence. In short, alienation is a lived reality and its negation a truly human interest. Hope, or what Hegel termed desire, is evident in all human relations; it is the unequivocal ground that gives substance and meaning to Being in the world. Each generation, indeed each biography, confronts in action the seemingly insurmountable SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES, Vol. 30 No. 3, July 1987 227-244 ? 1987 Pacific Sociological Assn. 227</page><page sequence="2">228 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES / JULY 1987 alienation of its time. The "stand," as it might be called, is that potential within the human spirit that experiences only limitation and constraint.' Yet both the possibility as well as the knowledge of something better evolve from these experiences. THE ART OF ANTICIPATING AN OTHER-ACHE So I shall suffer with the other, but without pressure, without losing myself. Such behavior, at once very affective and very controlled, very amorous and very civilized, can be given a name: delicacy; in a sense it is the "healthy" (artistic) form of compassion. This passage from Roland Barthes's (1978, p. 58) text, Fragments d'un discours amoreux, portrays a profoundly sen- suous and noble view of the possibilities inherent within all truly romantic relationships. For Barthes, this is the lived language of lovers who learn to ache compassionately for an Other. Distance and unity, fulfillment and desire: This is the syntax of love according to Barthes. Gadamer (1976, p. 67), however, says that "nothing that is said has its truth simply in itself, but refers instead backward and forward to what is unsaid" or, as Merleau-Ponty claimed, to that which cannot be said. Thus, if Gadamer is to be believed, Barthes's fragment of love is predicated upon presump- tion (history) and assumption (projection); the essential elements of the unsaid as well as what appears as its message. The presumption is that such a discourse can exist today. Both assume, needless to say, that an Other is there to fulfill the possibility of the discourse. Both the presumption and the assumption are possible; although there is reason to question their truthfulness. As Gadamer (1976, p. 16) states, "We love in an epoch in which an increasing leveling of all life-forms is taking place." If true, it is necessary to doubt the empirical existence of an Other to love. One must, in other words, begin to question the ability to engage a</page><page sequence="3">Crane, Ino / DISCOURSE OF DESPAIR 229 nontheoretical Other. In this regard, speaking specifically on the possibility of a discourse on love by lovers, Gadamer (1976, pp. 16-17) writes: When we hear modern lovers talking to each other, we often wonder if they are communicating with words or with advertising labels and technical terms from the sign language of our modern industrial world. It is inevitable that the leveled life-forms of the industrial age also affect language, and in fact impoverishment of the vocabulary of language is making enormous progress, thus bringing about the approximation of language to a technical sign-system. The human practice of creating the necessary conditions for an Other-ache to take place, the conditions required even to anticipate an Other-ache, is thus the focus of our analytic concern. TECHNOLOGIZING ANTICIPATION Gracefully Mature 1967 Buick Skylark custom 2drs. H.T. Beauti- fully maintained w/ only 65,000 original miles. $1,495. 966-8808 [Hawaii Tribune-Herald, March, 1983, p. 19]. With a relative paucity of anthropomorphic language, this automobile advertisement displays instrumental expression (and reason) at its finest. It transmits approximately 10 items of information in an economic ratio of two words per datum. Object status, quality, description, and other "facts" are neatly com- pressed into a few lines of written communication. Ads of this type are common and appear in newspapers, tabloids, fliers, and handbills throughout the world. The uninitiated ad writer or reader is only momentarily puzzled by the cryptic abbreviations such as "H.T." or "drs.,"for instrumental language is known and favored precisely for its alleged characteristic of being transparent and resistant of deeper meanings. This, then, is an example of the instrumental language of marketing an object, a used car.</page><page sequence="4">230 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES / JULY 1987 The reader may wonder what an ad for a used car has to do with anticipating an Other-ache or with the discourse of those seeking someone to love. While the specific contents of such an adver- tisement are not relevant to a discourse on love, if Gadamer is correct, it is likely that a discourse anticipating an Other-ache and that used to market a used car contain remarkable homologies. Given the identical medium of presentation, (i.e., an ad in a tabloid) both discourses are structured similarly: Tenn. Divorced male 59. 5'9'. 160 lbs, no dependents, healthy, financially secure, college graduate, affectionate. Desires slim companion, 32-50 with no dependents, who is healthy, a non- smoker. Social drinker. Must relocate [National Examiner, 11/30/82]. Lonely-hearts ads of this type appear in mass and regional tabloids throughout the world. In fact, these ads are so common- place that they are not limited to any particular culture, geographical, ethnic, or political group. They do not even appear to be limited to any particular class, although in the United States, "middle-class" authors seem to be the mode and therefore tend to dominate most of the columns. As the example illustrates, the ads are geared to locating and securing possible lovers, marriage partners, and friendly companions through a selective presentation of desirable, and frequently less undesirable, per- sonal and social characteristics of the author. THE EXPERIENCED HYPOTHESIS Through identifications and equivalences, what finally emerges in the discursive practice is a projection. This projection is a normalized, often highly stylized, simulacrum of the "everyman" (everyperson). The lonely-heart grapples for a way to speak, a way to relate. The everyman is that way. Oblivious to the contradictions, the everyman is known through traits and characteristics that, far from differentiating qualities, are selected</page><page sequence="5">Crane, Ino / DISCOURSE OF DESPAIR 231 on the basis of their inclusionary (sameness) force. The personal is rationality transformed into the impersonal. Even the apparent exercise of the will to power is readily translated into the hope of acceptability. A "gracefully mature 1967 Buick Skylark custom" becomes a "divorced Tennessean male aged 59;" a "2 drs. hard top, beautifully maintained" becomes a "healthy, affectionate college graduate." Even the disclaimers are a meaningless blend of honest desirability fused with honest nondesirability. Here, then, a rusty automobile runs well while a "queen-sized" lady is fun-loving. Distinctions are blurred and the ambiguity of indi- viduation, the necessary initial ploy, is quickly subordinated to the common rubric of "available." On the surface, the content and structure of these ads vary greatly depending upon the tabloid in question. This variation is clearly demonstrated when, for example, an ad from the New York Review of Books is contrasted with one from the Globe: (a) Distinguished, loving Man Sought. Refined, traditionalist, humanist, can feel passion; important contributor to society, w/ wealth &amp; integrity; enjoys wit &amp; thoughtful repartee, outdoors, fine arts; with or without children (possibly married), 40-70; by SW/female, 30's who's, if seen positively, considered spirited, beautiful, wise, very good sexually, accomplished; enjoys pleasing yet independent; traditional, direct, enterprising, helpful; elegant, high standards; analytic, playful, avant garde; committed inno- vative social thinker &amp; professional, (&amp; artist) for dear friend, affair-commitment, or marriage. [New York Review of Books, 9/21/82, 99.551. (b) G.A. Affectionate, honest, funloving lady, 31. 5'6Y 140 lbs, enjoys movies, C &amp; W music, dancing, home life, children and animals. Seeks honest, one woman man. Willing to relocate for "Mr. Right." Photo please. [Globe, 8/10/82]. It might be argued that such stylistic variations are important in at least one central aspect; namely, they reflect variations in the assumed or perceived readership of the papers in which they appear. Although there is no doubt some truth to this empirical observation, it does not undermine the thesis of a standardized</page><page sequence="6">232 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES / JULY 1987 discourse. In the final analysis, it would be highly problematic, at least theoretically, to assume that one could undertake a "social- psychoanalysis" of either the authors of such ads or a reconstructed generic mind or class/type of the readers of these ads. Either endeavor, as Adorno (1974, p. 18) noted in his analysis of astrology columns, would result in a distortion of the phenomenon in question, by shifting the focus of the analysis to an ideological dimension: Shifting responsibility from the manipulators (i.e., those struc- turing the discourse) to the manipulated (i.e., the reader/ writers of the lonely-heart columns) is a widespread ideological pattern. We must therefore be cautious not to treat our material dogmatically as a mirrored reflection of the reader's mind (or the writer's mind). Interesting as the stylistic differences are, there nonetheless exists a standardization, or common discursive structure shared by all lonely-hearts ads. Thus it is safe to assume that the style of the ads is seldom allowed to transgress the limits of respectability as manifest in the perceived readership of each paper. A single discourse capable of accommodating different norms of presenta- tion still is possible. That common discursive practice, moreover, occupies sociological interests and is the focus of this essay. While any number of lonely-hearts columns could have been selected for analysis, the remainder of this essay focuses upon the Sheela Wood's Have a Friend Club, which appears in at least two nationally distributed weekly tabloids, the Globe and the National Examiner. The actual readership counts are difficult to estimate with any reliability; both papers rely primarily upon supermarkets and other retail outlets for distribution. It is reasonable to assume that the column is one of the most popular in the United States and probably reaches millions of readers weekly. Averaging more than 200 ads per issue, there are some 20,000 lonely-hearts ads appearing annually between the two papers. As is the case with most lonely-hearts columns (see Burns, 1982), more women than men place ads; approximately 60% of the ads are placed by women.</page><page sequence="7">Crane, Ino / DISCOURSE OF DESPAIR 233 The column as it appeared in the Globe and National Examiner from August 1982 through February 1983 served as the data base for the present analysis. While presented here only in abstracted and condensed form, the ads for this seven-month period were subjected to a detailed content analysis,2 with the primary objective of constructing a discourse structure that could be used to illustrate the following proposition: Despite content plurality, a single discursive practice exists for those wishing to enjoy an Other-ache. This practice, moreover, as Gadamer claimed, bears a striking resemblance to the language employed to market commodities (e.g., used cars) in modern society. Thus the lonely-hearts ad, like all ads, has little to do with an object/ subject relationship, but rather is a form of speaking- writing evolving from a specific form of social relations. In the present case, the ads reflect market exchange processes found in capitalist societies. PSEUDO-INDIVIDUALIZATION For Adorno (1974b), the astrology column speaks directly to each reader. Its daily contents specifically gloss over common points in biography and gently slip into the unique contours of each individual's biography-unique contours that exist, according to Adorno, only in the mind of the individual reader. Written only once, these columns can be read countless times as though written anew for each reader-a sort of mythical hermeneutic spiral. The lonely-heart ad is woven from the same cloth. Its versatility is remarkable, although complicated by a double relationship with individuality. To begin with, it must be assumed that each individual ad is written by a different author (no small assumption given the general character of these tabloids). The author, as an individual, presents character traits and status qualities that appear to differentiate herself or himself along a number of standardized criteria. Physical attributes, which most generally include age, weight, height, and sex (race is generally assumed to be white</page><page sequence="8">234 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES / JULY 1987 unless otherwise stated), are joined with personality attributes (e.g., affectionate, honest, sports-minded). These in turn are supplemented by relational statuses such as occupational, marital, educational, religious (increasingly including some secondary mention of "born-again" status), economic, and financial. Finally attached to these three rubrics are tastes (e.g., country-western music, walks in the woods, cooking) and qualities sought in Other. The ultimate balance and differential highlighting of these categories furnish each ad with its seemingly unique character. The following are a few random examples: (a) Mo. Intellectually, spiritually together. Attractive widow. Ph.D., 5'7". Needs committed Christian man, past 50 whose values, priorities still give zest and meaning to life [Globe, 11 /09/92]. (b) Miss. Neat. Attractive, petite widow, 57. Brown hair. Blue eyes. Honest. Good dancer. Children grown. Seeks respectable, attrac- tive, financially secure man. 54-62. letter. Photo please [Globe, 11/30/82]. (c) Penn. Lonely, single girl 20, 5'7" brown hair, hazel eyes, non- smoker, likes animals, country life, togetherness, enjoys C &amp; W music and movies. Seeks affectionate, caring guy, for friendship, possible marriage [National Examiner, 12/4/82]. (d) N.Y. Single man, 37, 6'. 190 lbs, a nonsmoker, employed, owns home, enjoys fishing, gardening, long walks, children, home life, Seeks petite, gentle girl. Any age, or nationality [National Examiner, 1/8/83]. (e) USA. Mid South area. Quiet, intelligent, sensitive, caring, self- employed, successful, 41. 6', 230 lbs., loves to laugh, enjoys life's small pleasures. Home life, traveling, loves the outdoors. He has seen more than his share of rough times, but has drawn strength from adversity and eager to build a new life with a good woman who understands. She should be younger, petite, intelligent, mature, attractive, non-smoker, nondrinker, and share his feelings. Photo a must [Giobe, 10/30/82]. If the writer is presented as an individual, so also are the readers individualized. For example, the final category, "qualities sought," seems to address a plurality of possible readers. In fact,</page><page sequence="9">Crane, Ino / DISCOURSE OF DESPAIR 235 however, and as Adorno's (see 1974a,b,c) analysis reveals, neither the author nor the reader is individualized at all. Both the author and the reader are participants in a prefigured discourse that does not admit space for their individualizing marks, let alone allow for their individuality. Perhaps some authors do formulate their own ads in the literal sense of "authoring." More likely, however, most writers simply follow a standardized format that is detailed implicitly (as well as explicitly) for them. Standardizing the ad's format is advocated unabashedly in the columns themselves. For example, the following appeared in all Sheela Wood columns during the analysis period: Now available from Sheela Wood-a clear and easy reading guide for singles who want to find friendship. If you've been unsure about joining Sheela Wood's Have-A-Friend Club, why not order her new guide for singles. She's written this handbook for those of you who may want some simple advice on how to: prepare an ad or reply to one, put forward your best points, overcome nervous jitters during the first important call, and many more helpful hints. Don't let your uncertainty keep you from what could be a rewarding relationship. Send $1.25 to Sheela Wood, Globe, P.O. Box 2, Rouses Point, N.Y. 12979. Thus what appears at first glance to be individualization of both writers and readers is little more than pseudoindividualization. This point is further reinforced when one examines the use of qualifiers and disclaimers in the lonely-hearts ad. THE TECHNIQUE OF DISCLAIMING Roland Barthes (1977b, pp. 190-191) says that speech cannot be retracted. For Barthes, speech is irreversible and cannot be modified except by adding more speech. This is the paradox of the indelible character of monumental discourse. The lonely- heart ad is, to be certain, a form of monumental writing. Like all marketing strategies, it is a form of written speech; shallow,</page><page sequence="10">236 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES / JULY 1987 abstractly concrete, and indelible, the lonely-heart ad cannot be reversed except by saying/writing a reversal. Thus the ad must include its own negations. Written to replace Derrida's visual cross-outs with phrase negations, the ads, when analyzed, come across as little more than strings of self-negations. Attributes and characteristics are described and promptly offset through qualifying disclaimers. The flattening of attribute information makes all remnants of individualization fuzzy. The reader no longer reads the content but instead must listen to yet another tale of availability. What is being said or written? Perhaps all ads are only saying, "I write about myself as desirable although I cannot know your evaluation. My risk is great for disinterest is always a possibility and a fate." S.C.: He is not tall, dark or handsome, but he is attractive, personable and an interesting professional man of 48. He is blond, 5'8f, 165 lbs., has many interests and a sense of humor. Photo, phone [Globe, 11/9/ 82]. Like the gaze of a marble statue, the lonely-heart ad is unidirectional and necessarily alienated from the possibility of response and elaboration. Thus the writer tailors the discourse in anticipation of all possible responses, including disinterest. Extremes must be avoided for they cull out the available Others too greatly, thereby increasing the risks of disinterest. Rejoinders must be prefigured into the text; that one opportunity to speak. Weaknesses are softened into positive qualities. In short, the ad must revivify the notion of the everyman. Here again are shades of the automobile ad, where a cracked block can be offset by a recently rebuilt transmission and a damaged interior made to pale next to a set of like-new tires. The range of versatility of disclaimers cannot be overempha- sized. In a single issue of the National Examiner (10/19/82), for example, disclaimers/qualifiers were used in reference to the writer's age, sex, hair color, weight, religion, occupation (or lack thereof), location of residence, and body type, to mention a select</page><page sequence="11">Crane, Ino / DISCOURSE OF DESPAIR 237 few items. Virtually every possible status, attribute, quality, and trait was qualified at one point or another. Even the author's astrological sign is rendered meaningless by phrases such as "is a Gemini but relates well with others." HUMAN AS AN ADJECTIVE Adjective (aj'ik tiv), n. (1) Gram. of any a class of words functioning as modifiers of nouns, as good, wise, perfect... [Random House, 1975, p. 17]. It is highly improbable that any written human discourse could exist without meaning, for beyond the intention of the author, and beyond the prejudices of the reader, discourse can be said to occupy a space of meaning. It is structured, ordered, and inclusive of referents all of which exist to facilitate understanding the human condition. No discourse, or even phrase, however much a cliche, can be truly empty, although it might sign something that is devoid of substance. Yet where is the logic, indeed the value, of constructing a lonely-hearts ad around adjectives? What author would not like to be considered attractive, good-natured, loving, tender, and the like? For that matter, what person would want a companion who does not embody these noble adjectival qualities? In short, are not all the adjectives used nonsensical, since they have to be used and everyone knows that? Too frequently, people succumb to the temptation to treat words, indeed language itself, as an instrumental device. However, language is not merely a tool. Language, as Barthes (1977a, b; 1972a, b; 1970), Gadamer (1976), Heidegger (1962), and others have demonstrated, constitutes Being itself. People communicate not simply to transfer knowledge and/ or items of information (data), but to illustrate and participate in the relations that define the meaningful "core" of their lives. To speak is an act of declaration, to proclaim one's existence. To write is to offer</page><page sequence="12">238 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES / JULY 1987 objective evidence of one's existence, to mark one's place in and among all other possible points of existence. Language used is the sign of a life-world relating to other life-worlds. Each lonely-hearts ad is endowed heavily with ingratiating adjectives. These adjectives, however, refer not to the ennobling attributes and qualities of their users, but to the author's desire to belong. Recall here how Conrad in his Heart of Darkness tried to say that cannibalism is not necessary in any form. For Conrad, eating people was wrong because people should not eat them- selves. In analogous fashion, humans should not be deprived of humanity because humans are humanity. The adjectives thus proclaim the undifferentiated nature of the lonely heart; "I am a person!" Once the reader is disabused of the capacity to differentiate person from human, all adjectives come to modify a single noun, namely, human. In fact, the noun itself becomes the adjective; "my human objective (Being) is available." WILL TO POWER Is there an underlying metaphysical maxito the lonely-hearts column or ad? The present analysis suggests that one exists. It involves the "will to power" and is reflected in a desperate struggle to exercise the capacity to control. Even a cursory review of the lonely-hearts column depicts the ads as a public declaration of this desire. The columns are wants made known, acted upon, thrown into the public arena for evaluation and perhaps consump- tion. Who other than the pretentious or the powerful would be so forthright? It could be argued that these soliloquies of want and desire are nothing more than the desperate ramblings of the disenfranchised lonely; the pathetic cries of "love's lumpenproetariat." With all hope exhausted, the final act of the unloved is to pen a lonely- hearts ad and then silently await the arrival of their phantom cargo. Yet there is something illogical in this argument. For, if true, why would authors dare to include a section on their wants? Each author would simply present himself or herself as a</page><page sequence="13">Crane, Ino / DISCOURSE OF DESPAIR 239 set of attributes, and each ad would carry an implied postscript of "for general consumption." While this may be part of the unconscious motive of some authors, it is not a dominant structural feature of the column itself. On the contrary, it is the apparent exercise of the will to power that dominates. The author writes a lonely-hearts ad as an act of the will to control. Publicizing desire, clearly stating need, is not a passive act; it describes one's environment and relations. The process is rational. This rational act is based on an inversion of its own rationality. What appears on the surface to be a rational action aimed at securing the ground for a relationship (an intimate Other possibility) is, in reality, an act of self-subjugation. It is not the act of a desperate class of people, but rather a class of desperate acts. That is to say, loneliness is overcome by jettisoning the last vestiges of individuality and totally subjugating the self to a prescribed format. Here loneliness of the Iis negated by negating the I. The will to power becomes manifest in the recognition that one has no power. It is a desperate act precisely because it is an acknowledgment of and surrender to the condition of all modern relationships. It is simultaneously a truthful as well as untruthful act; truthful because it is tied into the political given of its time and untruthful for the very reason that it is ostensibly an apolitical act in a political environment. The contradiction is obvious. It is impossible for an action to be motivated both by fate and by human desire. Fate is transcendent, beyond the will to power; whereas human desire is imminent, for people to know and express in their relationships. THE CONVENTION OF CRISIS THINKING Human action embraces convention and ritual for political as well as practical reasons. Science, as human action, cannot possibly be insulated against constructing and abiding by its own, however particularistic, conventions. This obvious statement has one interesting if somewhat less than obvious correlative; namely, science on the practical level willdevelop conventions, necessarily</page><page sequence="14">240 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES / JULY 1987 and often uncritically. For example, witness the current sociolog- ical convention of identifying social phenomena with various intensities of crisis. Here, then, the greater extent to which social phenomena can be viewed as more intense, more subjective to change, more wrought with conflict, more anomic, more compli- cated, and "more unique" (sic), the greater their currency in the marketplace of legitimate intellectual concerns. In most instances, however, claims of crisis pertain to the logic of the discourse (the argument) concerning an object and not to the structuring principles of the object itself. All phenomena can be made to admit an historically unprecedented urgency. All phenomena can, just as easily and as a result, be misinterpreted as existing in crisis. Each historical period battles an enabling memory (what Gadamer calls tradition) and consequently struggles with a plurality of possible futures. It is important to realize, however, that each period aims at fulfillment through celebrating its ideal; its unknown self. Durkheim (1968), in his Elementary Forms of Religious Life, correctly understood this when he argued for a norm of historical continuity and a holistic strategy for sociolog- ical inquiry. The sociological mind, in Durkeim's faith, could not have been constructed otherwise. The point is that crisis thinking is a convention that enjoys mythological or illusionary status, not unqualified access to truth. Moreover, to proclaim crisis and thereby reduce social phenomena (including entire historical periods), to their partic- ulars and a positive shadow of their future (manifest as only a becoming) is illogical. This is not, however, sufficient grounds for rejecting difference in a gesture of methodological deference to similarity and continuity; nor is it a call to enjoy the "cerebral hygiene" concomitant with such ad hominem postures, attributing all to some mythical universal human factor. It is important to recall here Marx's statement in his famous Grundrisse (1973, p. 88): There are characteristics that all stages of production have in common, and that are established as general ones by the mind; but the so-called generalpreconditions of all production are nothing</page><page sequence="15">Crane, Ino / DISCOURSE OF DESPAIR 241 more than ... abstract moments with which no real historical stage of production can be grasped. In the final analysis, despite the apparent superficiality of much historical difference and seemingly profound similarities, differ- ence must inspire the sociological imagination. The ads do not confront us with a crisis. The world is experienced and known, not as an undifferentiated whole, but as a concrete set of practices and relations. That is exactly what this essay focuses upon; namely, one lonely area of human existence and action as experienced in the modern world. SUMMARY It would, of course, be pretentious to suggest that lonely-hearts columns offer the essential key to understanding American culture, let alone modern life in general. It may even appear trivial to analyze such phenomena. After all, by themselves, these columns are only of marginal interest sociologically and certainly shrink in importance next to many pressing issues of the times. Moreover, these ads hardly embody the major themes of contemporary social analysis, at least as those themes are bandied about conventionally. Yet despite their seemingly insignificant status among cultural creations, these ads do represent one dimension of lived experience in the modern world. Furthermore, this dimension is not marginal but, rather, all pervasive. In the language structure of the lonely-hearts ad is the spirit of the modern world. The fusion of fact and ideal, pseudoindividuality and the subjugation of self, the rational with the irrational, the quest for power with the acceptance of powerlessness-all are key aspects of the lonely-hearts column. If these ads speak of an anomic reality, it is not a reality experienced solely by the authors and readers of these columns. People speak/ write of their existence in terms of how they know and experience life. If language is power- less, it is because people experience the contradiction of being</page><page sequence="16">242 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES / JULY 1987 powerless in an age where power appears to flourish. If attempts to communicate culminate in the ironic inversion of intention- ality, it is because biographical intentionality is an unwelcomed guest in modern systems of world representation. One need recall only that C. Wright Mills (1959), in his Sociological Imagination, devoted considerable space to defending the proposition that biography and history are related. Finally, if language turns in on itself and becomes nothing more than a locational sign (albeit an elaborate one), it is because such mythic sign systems have replaced other ways of speaking.3 The lonely-hearts column, if it does nothing else, clearly demonstrates that Levi-Strauss was mistaken. Despite complex- ity, crisis, and rapid change, the modern world has not renounced myth in favor of technical knowledge. Instead, it has fused myth with technical knowledge and practice. Thus while impersonal and somewhat estranged efforts to secure lovers are nothing new (recall the history of arranged marriages, a history still unfolding), the alienated form of these efforts is remarkably new. The entrance of this estrangement into one of the last remaining sanctuaries of privacy represents the final thrust of impoverished language. As the lonely-hearts columns so clearly illustrate, despair now has a raison d'etre; it is at least one side of the totalizing language of our times. NOTES 1. Theodor Adorno (1982) refers to this social dynamic as the "stance,"the concept of "stand" being a modification of this. In his Aesthetische Theorie, for example, the stance represents the historically conditioned reality that at any given moment fixes the character of the relationship between human intentionality and its sociohistorical context. The stance, however, is not a universal category. Every stance is subject to change depending upon the extent to which humans can engage in critical-rational action; this is the potential of all human conditions. 2. The primary objective of this article is theoretical rather than methodological. Thus it does not present a full explication of the content analysis undertaken. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the theoretical framework of the article was assembled after the analysis rather than before, and in this sense might be viewed as a representative instance of inductive logic.</page><page sequence="17">Crane, Ino / DISCOURSE OF DESPAIR 243 3. The point here is that language is conditioned historically and not predicated upon any universalistic principle and/or function. Because today's communicative action appears empty (meaningful as only form, not content), does not imply that all communication acts can be understood adequately in terms of a form/ content distinction. However, much modern communication, including that analyzed in this article, has evolved until such a distinction offers the analyst considerable explanatory power. REFERENCES Adorno, Theodor. 1967.
