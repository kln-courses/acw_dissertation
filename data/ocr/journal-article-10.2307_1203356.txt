FRANK BURCH BROWN, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. KANDA, CHRISTINE GUTH. SHINZO: Hachiman Imagery and Its Development. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University, Council on East Asian Studies, 1985. xiv + 135 pp. $30.00 (cloth). Wedded as the study of religion has been to documentary evidence, it is not surprising that one field of investigation that has been assiduously neglected in conventional scholarship is that of sacred art. Critical reaction to such pioneer- ing efforts as those of Edwin Goodenough in the use of "mute evidence" from the late antique world may still be inhibiting historians of religions from fully exploiting this fertile source of insights. Conversely, art historians have often been as persistent in their reluctance to go beyond technical features in the attempt to discover historical and cultural clues in the materials they study. A bold attempt to overcome this sort of disciplinary myopia has now appeared, however, and the serious reader is afforded the refreshing opportunity to glimpse the startling potential of taking seriously the context of art for more than illustrative or classificatory convenience. Christine Guth Kanda, in this brief but trenchant account of Hachiman imagery and its development in early medieval Japan, not only introduces a long-neglected detail of Japanese religious history but also provides an extra- ordinarily suggestive illustration of the ways in which representational art can serve as primary evidence of religious attitudes and institutional history. In fact, the first half of the book is devoted to precisely those issues that are of particular interest to historians of Japanese religion, surveying the "aesthetic, religious, and cultic dimensions" (p. 5) of Shinto iconography (shinzo) as epitomized in representations of the deity Hachiman. The rationale for her choice of Hachiman reveals a great deal about her overall project. "Shinzo of Hachiman are among the earliest extant portrayals of kami and comprise one of the largest single groups of statues of any single deity. Hachiman, whose exact origins are obscure, typifies the kami born of a confluence of native and foreign traditions.... [Its] wide geographic, chronological, and qualitative range makes [Hachiman imagery] an ideal focal point for the study of shinzo in general" (p. 3-4). In part 2, individual icons are examined comparatively and in more tech- nical detail, tracing not only the evolution of Hachiman imagery itself but also the ways in which differences in the form, content, and function of various statues reflect both continuity and change in Japanese aesthetic and religious sensibilities from the ninth through the fourteenth century. Kanda's key examples are clearly illustrated with seventy-six monochrome plates, many of which appear here for the first time. By adopting a clear organizational schema, Kanda has been able to com- press a great deal of information and interpretation into what is after all a very economical (though not inexpensive) eighty-eight page text. The historical contexts for her comparisons are consistent and explicit. And her willingness to debunk popular misconceptions about institutional and devotional practices in Japan by systematically exposing religious syncretism from the very earliest 136</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews periods-even in epitomes of Japanese "Buddhist" culture-marks Kanda's effort as both serious and timely. There are, nevertheless, some inconsistencies and flaws in her analysis of the religious dimensions of early Japanese iconography that might disturb the specialist. For example, it is unclear how anthropomorphic representations that do not fit neatly into her formal classification of "courtly" or "syncretic" types differ religiously from those which do. Haniwa (p. 7) and hitogata (p. 10), as well as the comparative examples described in chapters 5-7 ("Other Shinzo"), are apparently distinguished from shinzo primarily in terms of their cultic functions; those that stand as the kami's material embodiment to which offerings are made are categorized as shinzo. Yet in cases where they are not the central icon, as, for instance, with the zuishin of the late Heian period, this functional distinction is ignored, and instead formal properties are invoked. Even more puzzling are Kanda's characterizations of the nature of these statues: are they permanently imbued with divine power? If so, why must that power be renewed periodically in some cases and not in others? And in what ways then are these statues to be considered "symbols" (pp. 15, 26), particu- larly when they remain for the most part resolutely undisplayed? These are all questions that are arguably peripheral to Kanda's stated intent. Yet they address the very issues that give her study a much wider significance in terms of the relation between religion and art than the modesty of her title suggests. She has demonstrated that sacred art can be a unique and valuable source of insight, complementing literary evidence rather than con- firming or displacing it. What the questions suggest is that, in order to explore fully the possibilities Kanda has revealed, greater collaboration between scholars of art and religion is necessary. If Kanda's Shinzo is able to inspire such cooperative efforts, we all have much for which to be grateful to her. EDMUND T. GILDAY, Chicago, Illinois. COMAROFF, JEAN. Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985. 296 pp. $32.00 (cloth); $14.95 (paper). This is a study of the social, political, and religious life of the Tshidi of South Africa. The Tshidi are a branch of the southern Tswana who live in the rural area of the South African-Botswana borderland. Like perhiperal societies elsewhere in the underdeveloped world, the Tshidi are caught in a number of contradictions. They are peasants but also proletarian laborers; they are polit- ically powerless but also culturally powerful; they are politically oppressed but also religiously free; they are socially fragmented but also religiously whole; they are determined by outside forces but also inwardly self-determining. Comaroff's study of these contradictions is a morally sensitive and theo- retically articulate account of an oppressed society in a neocolonial world. More than half of the book is devoted to Tshidi religion, especially Tshidi Zionism, a Christian, charismatic healing movement that is widespread in black South Africa. Comaroff's approach is to see the Zionist churches as indices of wider political and economic oppression. She rejects as "idealist" any perspective that would regard the Zionist churches as religious associations because "it extends to them a literalist, ethnocentric theory of meaning which ignores their embeddedness in the total social and cultural system" (p. 169). 137</page></plain_text>
