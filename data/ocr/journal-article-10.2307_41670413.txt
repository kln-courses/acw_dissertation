The campaign was supported also by the Direction of Antiquities for Lombardy, the Communità Montana di Valle Camonica, the Comune di Capo di Ponte and the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation of Lisbon. For general information on the rock art of this region see the author's book, Camonica Valley ( New York, Al- fred A. Knopf, 1961), and his earlier article in Archaeology 11 (1958) 30-39. During our eighth campaign of exploration in the Camonica Valley, in July 1963, we were informed by Dr. G. Castagna, Mayor of Breno, and by the Rev. A. Medici, of the village of Malegno, that a stele with prehistoric carvings had been found at Bagnolo, near Malegno. We immediately went to Malegno, where the stele had been transported, and also visited the site where it had been found; we returned later to make tracings and photographs. Bagnolo, in the Val d'Inferno, is located west of the road leading to the village of Lozio, about four kilometers (2V2 miles) north of Malegno. It is a pastoral area of grass and woods. The name Val d'In- ferno (Valley of Hell) apparently derives from the eroded rift, 300 meters deep, which opens up sharply just below Bagnolo and at the bottom of which flows the Lanico River. The site of Bagnolo is about 625 meters above sea level, on a narrow sloping terrace of glacial formation, at the foot of Mount Mignone. Before the modern road was built, the site must have been rather difficult to reach. The stele was discovered during the course of ex- cavating for the foundations of a house. When we reached the site, the trench was still open, and we were shown the spot where the stele had been found. The excavation had revealed a clear, neat section on the northwest scarp. Despite considerable differences between the strata, they appear to represent a se- quence of post-glacial deposits. The changes in sedi- mentation seem to reflect only minor climatic changes. The stele (Figure 1) was found fallen on its dec- orated face, on top of level 7 and crossing level 5 and part of level 4. If re-erected from the position in which it was found, the decorated face would have looked almost exactly east. As shown in the section, level 6 (which seems to have been dug into level 7) did not extend to the spot where the slab was found, appearing only in the southern part of the section. However, it seems probable that the stele was erected at the time of level 6. Considering the shifting of earth caused by the natural slope, we may suppose that the original site on which the stele stood must have been southwest of the spot where it was found. From the general slope and the kinds of deposits in the various levels we may deduce that the natural shifting of such a slab was no more than a few millimeters each year. Therefore we may believe that the stele might orig- inally have stood a few meters farther to the south- west. The stele is an erratic rock of a light reddish-brown sandstone. It was well polished by the action of ice 155</page><page sequence="3">Bagnolo Stele continued that must have rolled it around for thousands of years before it was found by man. This rock was very likely chosen by prehistoric man because of its shape, which vaguely resembles a human torso, with two protrusions below suggesting the beginnings of legs. The carvings are concentrated on about half of the rounded surface, while the other, coarser, face was not decorated. With the exception of the large rectangular design next to the solar disk, which is engraved in quite a different technique and is probably later in date, all the carvings seem to form a single composition, al- though probably executed by at least two different hands (Figure 2). At the top is a solar disk with rays all around (over two of them is superimposed part of the rectangular design). At each side of the disk is an ax. Below, in the center, are eight daggers, and below these are three slightly curved parallel lines. Above and to the right of the ax on the right side is the figure of a horned animal, probably an ibex. Without the design added later, the composition appears familiar. The same elements - sun, axes, dag- gers, parallel lines and animal - but in slightly dif- ferent order are repeated in rock-carvings at Borno, Cemmo and Paspardo in the Camonica Valley, and at Caven in Valtellina (see map) . In Camonica Valley the nearest parallel to this solar disk, with its thirty- three small rays all around and no central cup-mark, is the solar disk on rock No. 2 at Cemmo, which has forty-nine rays and no cup-mark (Figure 3). Solar disks which have a central dot, a cup-mark or a deeper cup-like engraving are common in Camunian petro- glyphs but rare in monumental compositions. At Cemmo the sun symbol is associated with an ax that belongs roughly to the same period as the axes of the Bagnolo stele, a halberd of Early Bronze Age type and triangular daggers with lunate pommels like those on the Bagnolo stele. The solar disk of the "Rock of Five Daggers" near Paspardo has the same sort of small rays and no cup in the center (Figure 4). (As I have shown elsewhere, this solar disk was purposely depicted in such a way as to suggest a stag's antlers.) The solar disk is commonly found in the Central Alpine area as a main element of such monumental compositions. It sometimes appears with rays in bands or groups, forming an almost anthropomorphic solar figure within the composition. Solar disks occur on similar stelae outside this area as well. At Triora, in Liguria, there is a decorated slab with a solar disk having twenty-one rays. Another solar disk of the same sort is incised on the back of a menhir statue from Aveyron in southern France. 156 1. (Opposite page) The Bagnolo stele. Maximum height 1.12 m.; breadth 0.88 m.; thickness 0.25-0.55 m. The two axes on the Bagnolo stele seem to be Early Bronze Age perforated stone axes of a kind rather common in northern Italy, mainly in the Alpine region (Figure 5). They are thin and rather elegant tools which probably evolved directly from coarser and heavier Eneolithic types such as one found at Iseo, about twenty miles south of Bagnolo. Again the figure in Camonica Valley nearest to these in type is found on rock No. 2 at Cemmo (see Figure 3), but in that case a metal rather than a stone tool seems to be represented. Two rather similar axes are found on the menhir stele from Termeno in the Alto Adige (Figure 6). The eight daggers of the Bagnolo stele all belong to the same general type, with triangular blade and lunate pommel, although each shows a slight varia- tion. Minor differences in the size and regularity of the pecking show that the daggers were not all ex- ecuted by the same hand. The five lowest daggers (two at left, three at right) have the same density of dottings and seem executed with the same tool and by the same hand. It is worthy of note that just as on the "Rock of Five Daggers" at Paspardo (see Figure 4) four of these daggers have thin, curved pommels, while one has a heavier pommel. The three uppermost daggers are smaller and the carving tech- nique is rather different, with less regular dotting; these were probably executed by another hand. This does not, however, indicate a considerable time lapse between the two groups. All the daggers are of the kind most common in the art of Early Style III of the Camonica Valley.* It has been shown that in the Alpine region they came into use during the Reme- dello Eneolithic culture, ending before the third phase of the North Italian Early Bronze Age, the Polada horizon. It seems, therefore, that they were in use between the twentieth century and the middle of the seventeenth century b.c. Below the daggers are depicted three parallel lines which are very slightly curved. These occur on Camu- nian monumental rocks and in some cases seem to suggest representations of body decoration. The sim- ilar lines on the "Rock of Five Daggers," which oc- cupy the same position in relation to the other figures on the rock as do those on the Bagnolo stele, have been interpreted as a belt.

At present we are unable to do much more than guess at the meaning of these lines. The last figure to be considered is that of the horned animal, presumably an ibex (Figure 8). It is nearly identical in style with animal figures on the two rocks at Cemmo and with animals on the Borno rock, which are clearly of Style III. In the case of the "Rock of Five Daggers," which is all executed by the same hand, the horned animal occupies its con- ventional place among the other signs and symbols, and the same occurs in the first phase of rock No. 2 at Cemmo. All the elements of the Bagnolo stele are consistent as to date. The solar disk finds its closest parallels on monuments belonging to Camonica Valley phase III-A; the axes represent weapons of the Early Bronze Age; the daggers may belong either to the Eneolithic or the Early Bronze Age; the parallel lines are like others of the Transition phase and of phase III-A; the same applies to the animal figure. It ap- pears, therefore, that this monument can be dated either in the Transition phase (i.e. between phases II and III) or in phase III-A, that is, sometime between 1800 and 1650 b.c. (see La datazione dell'arte preis- torica camuña, page 83) . Of the several monuments in Camonica Valley which are similar in character to the Bagnolo stele, some are stelae, others are monumental rock-carvings. While the great majority of the carvings in Camon- ica Valley are on horizontal or slightly sloping rock faces, these monuments are all engraved on vertical surfaces and all have a limited repertory of figures repeated in a similar order and revealing precise con- cepts behind well reasoned symbolic compositions. In a study of the Borno rock by R. Battaglia and M. O. Acanfora ( Bullettino di Paletnologia Italiana n.s.II, 64 [1954] 225-255) it is stated that the figures engraved on that rock are similar to those on the anthropomorphic stelae of Alto Adige (Figure 9) and the carved slabs of Valtellina (Figure 10). How- ever, no attempt has been made to analyze the sym- bolic meaning of the figures. It is generally agreed that the anthropomorphic stelae from Alto Adige are of a religious character, but no reason has been adduced for the depiction of weapons, belts, collars and other elements. The similarity between the various elements on the Camonica Valley monuments and those of carvings from Alto Adige and Valtellina and their similar composition and order leave little doubt that all these decorated rocks, slabs and menhirs are based on com- mon concepts and have common purposes. The slabs in Alto Adige and Valtellina have clear outlines and almost suggest some sort of "divine body." In the Camonica Valley, compositions of a comparable kind are found on larger rocks where the apparently un- connected figures do not form an enclosed complex. Until now the only exception has been the Ossimo stele (see map), a rather small erratic rock vaguely anthropomorphic in form, with prehistoric engrav- ings, but the symbols it bears are of a different kind. The Bagnolo stele is the first monument of its kind to be found in the Camonica Valley, the typical figures and symbols of the monumental compositions - solar disk, weapons, "belt" and animal - being de- picted on a slab of vaguely anthropomorphic shape. This stele confirms the conceptual connection between the monumental art of the Camonica Valley and the anthropomorphic menhir-stelae of Alto Adige and Valtellina. Rock No. 2 of Cemmo gives a hint regarding the symbolic meaning of the figured weapons. On its up- per part is a rather simple composition in which the solar disk seems to be placed as a "head" and the four weapons as the four limbs of what may be interpreted as an anthropomorphic divinity (see Figure 3). This kind of peculiar Early Bronze Age symbolism is not limited to the Camonica Valley; it is current also in Valtellina and Alto Adige, where the stelae show weapons in place of arms and legs, and where the "torsos" are decorated rather realistically with collars, belts and other elements of body decoration (see Fig- ures 9, 10). It is puzzling that sometimes these decorated stelae and slabs have a greater number of "weapon-limbs" than do human bodies. Such "divine images" would seem to be based on concepts like those revealed by some types of Asiatic divinities, such as Indian gods with several arms, and other Oriental mythological figures. It is noteworthy that the Alpine monuments are much older than any record of such divinities in Asia. It would be of interest to see whether the two phenomena might reveal a common conceptual origin, but this, in any case, requires further investigation. On the Alpine monuments, besides the weapons placed as arms and those located below the belt as legs, there are other weapons depicted in places that would suggest other parts of the human body, such as the beard, the heart, the liver and the ribs. But there are also other compositions in which it does not seem possible to recognize an anthropomorphic intent in the location of the weapons and other elements, such as, for instance, that on the first rock of Cemmo.

This leads us to the logical assumption that if the repre- sentation of limbs and other parts of the human body is not an essential attribute of these figures made up of weapons, there must be another symbolic meaning more important to the people who created the monu- ments. The Paspardo rocks were the first Alpine monu- ments discovered which seemed to represent some kind of "solar divinity" (Bullettino di Paletnologia Italiana n.s.XI, 66 [1957] 189-220). Since our study of them, new finds have been made, bringing the total number of such monuments to nineteen. Of these only three have the solar disk as a prominent element: the Borno rock, the "Rock of the Sun" near Paspardo and the third stele of Caven in Valtellina. In these cases the solar disk has bands of rays giving it a vaguely anthropomorphic shape, and the other symbols sur- round it. On five or six other monuments the solar disk, although appearing in a central place, is not dominant in size and probably is also in value about equal to the other symbols ; these monuments are the Bagnolo stele, the "Rock of Five Daggers," the sec- ond rock of Cemmo, two of the Caven stelae and pos- sibly also stele No. 1 at Lagundo in Alto Adige. All the other known monuments of this sort have no solar symbols at all. We may thus deduce that the solar disk is not an essential attribute and that, although it in some cases occupies a place of honor, in others it is simply one of the various component symbols on these monuments and it may or may not be present. It should be noted, however, that although there may be several daggers and axes, there is always only one solar disk. As we can see from all the Alpine art of this pe- riod, the artists who engraved the monumental com- positions were capable of representing exactly what they intended. An attempt at anthropomorphization is evident in most of the compositions but not in all of them. This seems to show that even an anthropomor- phic shape is not an essential attribute of these sym- bolic compositions. The general shape and the order in which die symbols are arranged seem almost of sec- ondary value when compared with the meticulous at- tention given to the types of symbols and the number of times each is represented. When the figures are ar- ranged so as to suggest the human body, the config- uration seems to indicate an attempt to give material form to an abstract concept. It appears that each of the component figures stands for some attribute or value and all together they form a complex of ideal values. If this interpretation is valid, we may find similar concepts in some religions of the present, in which the concept of the divinity includes several divine elements, each with a different value but all forming a single whole. Returning to the Alpine monuments, if we assume that the solar disk stands for light, the daggers for strength, the axes for power and the torque-collar for beauty, a composition including these elements would present a combination of these ideals. The suggestion of anthropomorphic shape existing in some cases may indicate that all the attributes or powers belong to the same being and form a unity, as do the limbs of a human body. It is still premature to attempt a final definition of the precise symbolic and religious values of these monuments, but we may make a preliminary state- ment. Each sign or figure included in this sort of composition had, besides its clear literal significance, a symbolic meaning as well. While it sometimes stood for a limb or part of some other concrete expression of an abstract idea, it symbolized mainly an attribute of power, protection, defense, fertility, beauty or some other quality. The precise meaning of the various com- ponent elements and the reason for their use will be fully discussed in a forthcoming study. Such symbolism and such complex concepts are un- expected in the Early Bronze Age of Alpine Europe, and even more so when we consider that on each stele these figures appear in a different order and in differ- ent numbers. Therefore, although the variety of sym- bols seems to have been limited, these compositions represent neither a single anthropomorphic supernat- ural being nor a large number of different divinities. They seem rather to symbolize the synthesis of various ideal attributes in a single whole. These attributes do not appear to represent supernatural forces but basic elements of life. Each composition, in a slightly dif- ferent way, almost appears as a synthesis of life, con- ceived in a simple fashion. The presence of these concepts as revealed by the Bagnolo stele and other such monuments helps to pre- dict new horizons in the interpretation of other ex- amples of prehistoric art in which similar elements have until now been considered only from the real- istic aspect. Their study will open a new chapter in the field of prehistoric religion. 161</page></plain_text>
