<plain_text><page sequence="1">LOSS AND RECOVERY OF RITUAL SELF AMONG HINDU IMAGES Richard Davis Abstract A recent court case in London concerning the repatriation of a smuggled bronze Šiva Nataraja image from Pathur, South India, raises the question of the continued "life," or ritual efficacy, of icons that have been displaced or disused. This essay reconstructs the liturgical biography of the Pathur Nataraja, based on medieval South Indian priestly texts in order to understand the sense in which a Šiva image is ritually animated and to evaluate its fitness for returning to worship. I discuss the initial establishment of the image, its employment in regular temple processions, the rite of defensive burial used to hide the image when threatened, and techniques of revivifying worn icons. A latent presence of Šiva subsists in the Pathur Nataraja, I conclude, even after it has been buried for six hundred years, transported overseas, and imprisoned in a London bank vault, and this latency can serve as the basis for the reanimation of the image when returned to India. 'We are those whom Christmas overthrew Some centuries after Pheidias knew How to shape us And bedrape us And to set us in Athena's temple for men's view. 'O it is sad now we are sold - We gods! for Borean people's gold, And brought to the gloom Of this gaunt room Which sunlight shuns, and sweet Aurore but enters cold. 'For all these bells, would I were still Radiant as on Athena's Hill. 'And I, and l' The others sigh, 'Before this Christ was known, and we had men's good will.' (Hardy 1976:927-28) In Thomas Hardy's "Christmas in the Elgin Room" we are privileged to overhear the afterhours conversation among the Greek gods removed from the Parthenon, otherwise known as the Elgin Marbles, one Christmas eve in the British Museum. Through Hardy's conceit we hear them reflect on their own loss of power and learn of their historical</page><page sequence="2">44 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES: 6(1) (WINTER 1992) observation that it was Christ who was finally responsible for their now disempowered position. Hardy's triumphalist trope brings into relief the question at the center of this essay: do religious images, once consecrated as living icons, continue to "live" after they have been removed from their original ritual settings and repositioned as art works in Western museums? To my knowledge, in the 180-year debate over the repatriation of the Parthenon friezes, the animate character of the sculptures has never been used as an argument for their return (Hitchens 1987). No one supposes that these old Hellenic deities are still alive; they have been truly and irrevocably supplanted in their homeland by Christ, much as Hardy's talking friezes recognize. However, the issue of continued life has recently been raised in another repatriation case, one involving a twelfth-century South Indian bronze image of Śiva Nata rāja that was smuggled abroad, sold to a collector, confiscated from the British Museum as stolen property, and now stands to return to its homeland. What makes this case more striking (and the Hardy poem more relevant) is that the god Śiva himself appeared as a plaintiff in the court case, acting as a "juristic person" to sue for the return of his image. Śiva is much more alive in contemporary India than the old Greek gods are in modern-day Greece, and in the post-colonial world his domain of activity appears to have reached even into the old imperial capital. THE PATHUR NATARĀJA In 1976 a landless laborer by the name of Ramamoorthi, digging the foundations for a cowshed in the precincts of a ruined village temple in Pathur, Tamilnad, accidently stumbled upon a treasure-trove of nine buried bronze images (United Kingdom High Court 1988; Greenfield 1989:177-86). The images had probably been fabricated in the twelfth century concurrent with the construction of the temple. At the time, Hindu priests would have carried out elaborate rites of establishment (pmtisäw) to bring about the actual presence ( sammdHãm ) of the deity represented in each material icon. Thereafter the local worshippers would have considered the images to be living divinities and would have felt it incumbent upon them to treat the gods accordingly. In daily services ( upacara ) intended to please the deity the priests would have received the image graciously, bathed and dressed it, provided food and all other necessities, entertained it with music and dance, and sung its praises - in short, treated the living image as a most honored divine guest gracing their community. The images were probably buried, with all due ceremony, in the fourteenth century when Muslim armies, feared for their iconoclasm, invaded and briefly ruled the area. Evidently, the</page><page sequence="3">DAVIS: LOSS OF RITUAL SELF 45 images remained in their subterranean retreat until Ramamoorthi chanced upon them. Instead of turning his findings over to the local authorities, Ramamoorthi stealthily reburied the images and later sold one - the Śiva Na ta rāja bronze - to a certain Chandran, a "man of bad character" ostensibly involved in the film industry, for 200 rupees. Chandran in turn sold it to a tobacco merchant from Thanjavur, and through a string of purchases the commoditized divinity made its way underground from rural Tamilnad to London, where it was fixed up with a false pedigree and sold to the Bumper Development Corporation of Alberta, Canada, for roughly 250,000 pounds. The head of the company, Robert Bordon, is a prominent collector of Asian art who loans many of his possessions to the Glenbow Museum in Calgary and the Edmonton Art Gallery. While the smuggled image was receiving some conservation work at the British Museum before its journey to Canada, someone tipped off the police, and they quickly impounded the object as stolen property. Officials in India sued for its return, and extensive litigation ensued. Among the several plaintiffs bringing suit was Śiva himself, for it was an established principle of medieval Hindu law, adapted by British colonial administrators as well, that the god of a temple may act as a "juristic person" on behalf of the religious institution that is in effect his palace and constitutes his property (Sontheimer 1964:45-100). At stake most immediately in the case was the future destination of the image: would it be sent off to Canada to be displayed as an Indian art object for the interested public of Alberta, or would it be returned to India to be reconsecrated as a divine object of worship in a small village temple? Such cases involving the repatriation of cultural treasures, of course, raise many legal and moral issues concerning political identity, cultural heritage, and international jurisdiction, and frequently involve substantial economic gain and loss. But this particular case posed as well an ontological and ritual question bearing upon Indian images (and upon ritually animated objects of other cultures as well) exhibited in Western museums. Do Indian divine images continue to "live" when torn from their proper ritual contexts? Or do they lose their lives when relocated in new settings, deprived of the services they had come to expect? It was the premise of the Indian plaintiffs seeking restitution of the Natarāja that, according to the principle, "once a god, always a god," Śiva was still in some sense present in the bronze even as it languished in a London bank vault, and that the image could be reconsecrated as an object of worship when returned to its home. This claim was disputed by the defendents, who held that the bronze had been rendered unfit for ritual employment through disuse and dislocation. The question of whether such objects continue to live has no meaning in a Cartesian world, where material objects never lived in the first</page><page sequence="4">46 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES: 6(1) (WINTER 1992) place. I do not expect museum curators to begin feeding the Indian images in their collections or serenading them with panegyric. For Hindus, however, it is a different matter. The theophany of a divinity in a material object is, and has long been, at the center of Hindu devotional and liturgical practice. Accordingly, medieval Hindu ritual texts and temple practices evince a lively concern for the means by which divine images are fabricated and animated, the conditions under which images may lose their lives, the criteria for determining whether displaced images should be abandoned or rescued, and the ritual procedures necessary to reinstate recoverable images as divinely inhabited icons. In this essay I will retrace the ritual biography of the Pathur Natarāja, following the priestly guidebooks of the period, as a way of specifying the animation or "ritual selfhood" of the image. I will look at the initial consecration of the object, its employment as a processional image in temple liturgy, and the procedures of defensive burial by which it was hidden from looters in the fourteenth century. This story will give us a basis for reconsidering the question of whether the bronze can be considered still alive and for assessing whether it may eventually be returned to worship in its native place. CONSECRATION An image of Natarāja (the "Lord of Dance") represents Śiva performing the dance by which he recurrently creates, maintains, and destroys the material cosmos, and by which he both veils the true nature of reality from human beings and grants them final emancipation. As an iconographie form it was developed and popularized in Tamilnad in the late tenth century (Dehejia 1990:40). Through the patronage of the Cola dynasty, ruling the area from the tenth through thirteenth centuries and adopting Natarāja as a family divinity ( ktàmãyaka ), this form of Śiva became extremely prevalent during the period. Virtually every Saiva temple in central Tamilnad was provided with a Šiva Natarāja bronze as one of its primary processional images. When the Pathur temple was constructed in the twelfth century, the Natarāja would have been fabricated as part of an entourage of anthropomorphic images representing Siva and subordinate deities to accompany the central icon of the temple, the Siva linga. All the images, the linga, and the temple itself would have undergone parallel processes of consecration, making them all fit receptacles for Siva's divine presence. Indian temple images are brought to life through the consecration procedure known as "establishment" ( pratistfiā ). Hindus consider establishment an instrumental and efficacious ritual, bringing about an</page><page sequence="5">DAVIS: LOSS OF RITUAL SELF 47 actual transformation in the character of the object, rather than simply a symbolic ratification or display of divinity. To discuss this animation of images, medieval Hindu texts often employ the analogy of a transmigrating soul entering a human body. The fabricated image is a body ( vigraha ) or embodiment (mūri 0. Divinity in the form of a soul (atman), animating spirit ( jtva ), life-breath (piāņa), consciousness (cetano), or divine energy (śakti) must enter this body to bring it to life, to infuse it with divine presence, just as a soul must enter a human body to instill life into it. In the Indian view, however, coming into full human life is not a single event, but rather a process marked and effected by recurrent transformative rituals (samslčāras) that gradually complete and refine the person (Inden and Nicholas 1977:37). So too, establishment does not focus upon a dramatic, abrupt transfiguration from inert matter to living icon. Rather it involves an elaborate sequence of rites that, through repeated imposition of mantras, powers, and substances, progressively constitutes the fabricated image as fully imbued with Siva's divine presence. Medieval Saiva texts like KāmiĒgama (pMvabhāgi, chap. 68), for instance, list twenty-two constituent rites making up the ritual of establishment, from the appropriation of materials through the final worship of the fully established temple image. The analogy that best captures this gradualist ritual procedure is that of kindling fire. Because Siva is by theological definition ubiquitous, he is considered to be already present, in a latent sense, even in the raw materials gathered to create the image, just as fire is believed to be latent in the dry wood or smouldering embers used to build a fire. Saiva texts refer to this as Siva's general, or common (samanyc), presence (Davis 1991:119-20). The aim of establish- ment is to enhance or manifest that divine ubiety in a particular location, bringing about Siva's special, or marked (višista), presence in the image, much as one stokes up ash-covered embers into a blazing fire by adding grass, sticks, and ladles full of ghee. Accordingly, the rites of establishment commence with the initial selection of materials. When making a wooden image, for example, priest and artisan undertake a field trip to the forest, and choose only specimens that bear an innate resemblance to the intended deity (Phukan 1989:9). "Male" trees are destined to serve male divinities, "female" trees, goddesses (Sakaíãdhikãra 22:10). The eastern side of the tree is marked as the "face," since the completed image will also face east. The tree is properly honored and purified, cut and cleaned, transported back to the construction site, and then once again worshipped with mantras and auspicious substances. Even before the first cut of the chisel, the material is treated as a deity-in-the-making. The second phase of establishment involves the physical fabrication of the image. The priest presents the raw material to the</page><page sequence="6">48 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES: 6(1) (WINTER 1992) artisan and requests him to make the image, following certain conventional iconographie and iconometric guidelines. As the artisan sets to work carving, the priest simultaneously performs ritual work. He repeatedly recites the mantra that most fully invokes the deity onto the image as it comes into form. When a bronze image like the Pathur Nata rāja is made following the lost-wax method, the priest swaddles the initial beeswax model in cloth, places it on a bed of grain and sacrificial grass, honors it with a series of oblations, and recites the mantra evoking the deity over it ( Padmasamhitā kriya 19:33-46). He returns the wax effigy to the artisan, who encloses it in a clay mold, and that mold is treated to the same actions of swaddling, honoring, and invoking. Finally, the artisan fires the clay mold, melting the wax, and fills the resulting cavity with molten metal. When the metal has solidified, he breaks open the mold to free the bronze image. The priest immediately subjects this to further mantra recitations identifying the bronze with the deity who is to inhabit it. There is never a time when the image exists as an unconsecrated object; its very coming into being is within ritual. The third phase of establishment, involving the initial "awakening" of the image, centers around the opening of the eyes ( netronmilana ). After a sacrificial pavilion and a pedestal within it have been carefully constructed, the newly made image is placed atop the pedestal, and the priest uses a golden needle to draw the outlines of šiva's three eyes (Kâmtiâigpma purea 68:35-36). The sculptor then opens the eyes with a diamond needle and other apertures with a chisel. The priest rubs the eyes of the image with unguents and displays before it a series of highly auspicious objects: ghee, a pot of honey, heaps of grain, brahmans reciting praises, virgins in full decoration, and the assembled crowd of devotees (Kāmikāgama purva 68:47-51). The priest immediately washes and purifies the image with clay, ashes, cowdung, and other substances, and then dresses it in clean clothes and adorns it with suitable ornaments. Temple servants take the image on a palanquin and circumambulate the village. By this time the image has clearly reached an initial stage of livelihood. It can see objects placed before it and is worthy of processing its community of worshippers, but its ritual metamorphosis is by no means yet complete. After its circumambulation, the image enjoys a restful interlude, dwelling in water ( jatādhivāsana ) for as many as nine nights. Evidently, the purifying effects of the water - which is identified with the most auspicious of all waters, the river Ganga - are needed to remove any lingering defects of earlier ritual processes and to raise the image to a higher level of purity required for the fifth and culminating phase. Preparations for this phase begin with the elaborate decoration of the pavilion, large-scale feeding of brahmins, and the construction of a couch suitable for a lord. The image is bathed and dressed once more</page><page sequence="7">DAVIS: LOSS OF RITUAL SELF 49 and then brought to the pavilion and raised onto the couch. The priest next performs an affusion ( abhiseka ) that imposes the embodiment (murtinyisa) onto the image. He sets up a large number of waterpots, with all proper accoutrements, in a determinate geometrical configuration around the image. Into every one he invokes a deity or divine power, reciting the appropriate mantra for each. Collectively, the pots thereby come to encompass all the most important cosmic forces identified by Šaiva theology. The priest worships each pot, since each is in itself now divine, and then he pours the contents of each one over the image. As the water washes over it, the divinities and powers embodied in the pots infuse the image, until it becomes a divine body ( divyadeha ) composed of the cumulative mantra-energies of all the pots. Only with a body of mantras ( vidyadeha ), the Šaiva texts explain, does Šiva act in this world. Accordingly, the ritual of establishment seeks to transfigure the material form of the image, not simply as an animate being but as a divine body of mantra powers, so that Šiva himself will see fit to inhabit and act through it. After its anointment the image is carried into the temple proper, where it is installed in its own shrine, bathed, dressed, and adorned again. Finally, the priest performs full worship (pujā) to the image for the first time, recognizing that it has been fully transformed into a state of "Šiva-ness" (šivatva), and that it now serves as the appropriate support for Šiva's special presence in its new setting. PROCESSION An image like the Pathur Nata rāja would not have served as the central image in a twelfth-century Šaiva temple. That place would have been occupied by an object we seldom find in Western museums, a smooth cylindrical shaft made of heavy stone emerging vertically from an hourglass-shaped stone pedestal - namely, the Šiva-liňga. (The only significant exception to this, the Cidambaram Natarāja temple, was the cultic center of Šaivism in medieval Tamilnad.) This linga contrasts physically with the other metal embodiments of Šiva in two significant respects: it is fixed and unmoving while the bronzes are portable, and it is abstract and non-partitive, while the bronzes are anthropomorphic images richly attributed with limbs, facial expressions, and ornaments. Precisely these physical characteristics make the lińga most suitable, in the Šaiva view, for serving as the root-embodiment (mūlcmīūrti) of Šiva in the central sanctum of the temple, from which the other temple images are said to emanate (Brunner 1968:445-47; Srinivasan 1990:108- 142). Because in form the lińga is without parts ( niskala ), it is the most appropriate support for Šiva in his highest, encompassing, undifferentiated aspect. This aspect of Šiva is similarly non-partitive,</page><page sequence="8">50 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES: 6(1) (WINTER 1992) while the more human-like bronze images of šiva, with parts (sakala), correspond to the encompassed, differentiated manifestations of Šiva as he has acted on earth. This distinction is the basis for a topographic hierarchy of icons and of Šiva's occupancy in a šaiva temple. Šiva's presence would be most focused, blazing most intensely, in the inner sanctum linga. It is active to a lesser degree in the images and subordinate icons placed outward from the center. For this reason, it is the šiva-liňga and not an anthropomorphic image that is considered the lord or proprietor of the temple. It acts as the juristic person in any lawsuit involving it. Medieval Šaiva temples observed a corresponding hierarchy of access among those who came to worship šiva. Only initiated šaiva- brāhmaņa priests were allowed to worship the linga in the innermost sanctum directly. Depending on birth community and initiatory status, members of other groups were required to confine their worship to the outer precincts of the temple, where they could worship Šiva's manifest forms but not the central linga, except through the priests' mediation. Still others were not allowed even to enter the gateway of the temple (Filliozat 1975:103-117). Being a graceful divinity, Šiva was not entirely content with this hierarchical and restrictive arrangement. Every day, and much more dramatically during special calendrical festivals, he would undertake a procession (yatra) through his domain - the temple precincts and often the town as well - to extend his grace to the broader public unable to enter his sanctum (Davis 1991:71-72). However, the linga is an immobile (acala) icon, fixed to a massive stone pedestal, and cannot undertake such a tour. It was necessary, therefore, for Šiva to inhabit temporarily a movable (cala) bronze image for the course of the procession. There is good reason to believe that Natarājas were generally chosen as the main processional images of twelfth-century South Indian temples, and the fact that the Na ta rāja image was by far the largest of the bronzes buried in the Pathur cache indicates its preeminence among the portable images there. For a daily procession the temple priest would have approached the processional image located near the central liňga, honored it with the usual offerings of worship, and recited a mantra that transfered divinity fully from the linga to the image (Ajitagama kriyà chap. 25). Šiva's divine energy is transposable through the medium of mantras. The processional image was then cleaned, dressed in clean white clothing, given a turban and Šaiva ash-marks, garlanded, and adorned with other ornaments. A retinue of accompanying images were similarly outfitted for the parade. The temple servants then grasped them, placed them on palanquins or bamboo poles, and amidst the blowing of conches and beating of drums, accompanied by incense and oil lamps, with singers and dancers alongside, they left the sanctum and ventured</page><page sequence="9">DAVIS: LOSS OF RITUAL SELF 51 out on tour. A typical daily procession involved three concentric circuits, visiting the many subsidiary shrines dedicated to subordinate deities and receiving the homage of worshippers both inside and out of the temple precincts. During calendrical festivals, the processional deity, decked out in a much grander chariot, would make still larger tours throughout the town. Finally, the image and its retinue returned to the inner sanctum, where the processional image was set down next to the central linga, and Šiva's energy was transferred by means of a mantra back into the linga ( Kumaratantra 8.28). In this manner the portable bronze Nata rāja of Pathur would have varied over the course of each day in the degree or intensity of its divine animation. Though already consecrated as a suitable support for Šiva's divine presence, much of the time it would have stood by, Šiva's presence only latent in it, while the central liňga received the primary tokens of devotion presented by Šiva's worshippers. However, during the daily processions Šiva's fullest presence would have been transferred into it, like coals being periodically kindled into flame, and it would have served then as a mobile icon of Šiva's grace, extending his favor beyond the restricted sphere of the inner sanctum. LOSS AND RECOVERY From šiva's point of view the Latin adage ars longa, vita brevis needs to be reversed. While Šiva himself is by definition eternal, the fabricated embodiments he inhabits on earth are inescapably subject to the entropie forces of decay and destruction that are the lot of all matter. Objects deteriorate through the normal effects of ritual erosion. Receiving regular baths of water, milk, honey, cow urine, and various other materials will over time wear down even the best quality bronze. Ritual objects can become targets for more drastic measures: seizure, mutilation, and destruction by human agents motivated by political or economic ends. Late-medieval warriors of iconoclastic religious persuasions (both Turko- Afghan Muslims and Portuguese Catholics) and twentieth-century art thieves have often directed their efforts towards the anthropomorphic representations of the Hindu gods. Any such loss posed a grave concern for the temple priests and worshippers of these embodied divinities, for it threatened to erase the divine presence for which they had extended such elaborate ritual effort. To help deal with such cases, medieval priestly texts recognize and list the various ways images could become unsuitable for worship. The texts set out criteria for determining whether images are recoverable and specify ritual procedures for revivifying them. Images might, for example, become broken, burned, split, defaced, or worn out. They might have been made improperly in the first place, or made by</page><page sequence="10">52 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES: 6(1) (WINTER 1992) unsuitable persons. They could be dislocated in a flood. They might be attacked violently by enemy armies or stolen by thieves, and they might be handled by impure persons ( Mayamata 35:15-18; Somaiambhupaddhati 288). In certain cases the damage to the image is considered so great that it must simply be abandoned. An image that has lost its distinguishing features ( laksarn ) - as when an invader has hacked off its arms - is no longer fit to embody the god, since images of god should be complete and whole just as Śiva himself is. The texts say that one should dispose of such images as quickly as possible, since they are effectively dead as supports for divinity. Clay images are thrown into the water, metal images are melted down, and wooden ones are cremated in fire, much as human corpses are consigned to flames on the funeral pyre. Sometimes, too, images deteriorate irrevocably in more predictable fashion. At Jagannātha temple in Orissa wooden images are used as the central icons of Visņu and his cohorts. As one local text, the Bhuvanaprakāša , admits, this choice of material entails a major disadvantage: stone images need to be replaced only after ten thousand years, metal ones after one thousand, while wooden ones require replacement every ten years (Tripathi 1978:223). Consequently, a regular ceremony of replacement, entitled navakalevara ("new embodiment"), must be held eveiy twelve or nineteen years, during which new wooden images are manufactured and carefully consecrated. Then, at night, with all lights extinguished, the ritualist blindfolded, the animating essence (called the brahmapacfārtha here) of each deity is removed from the old and eroded wooden images and transferred into the newly made ones. Once their brahmapaíàrtha-s have been removed, the old images are considered to be dead, and they are buried in a nearby graveyard for old. . images. The next day, the newly consecrated images celebrate a grand inaugural festival by touring the city of Puri in huge chariots. Generally, though, moderately worn, displaced, or untended images are considered recoverable, provided they are still intact and recognizable. Mayamata (35:39-40), for example, clearly distinguishes between images that have lost major limbs and must hence be abandoned, and those that have lost such minor appendages as "hands, nose, ornaments, ears, or teeth," which "should be rendered complete by restoring these things." For images whose eyes have been worn from the repeated bathings and rubbings of regular worship, restoration by recutting the eyes is prescribed (Linda 1988:59-61). By this reckoning the Pathur Nata rāja is certainly salvagable as an icon, for physical damage to it was confined to peripheral iconographie detailing: only the snake on Šiva's right hand and the flame in his left hand, along with parts of his scarf and his whirling locks, were broken. As the flame of an untended fire diminishes to coals, so a divine presence becomes less intense in an unworshipped image. Consequently,</page><page sequence="11">DAVIS: LOSS OF RITUAL SELF 53 before returning to ritual life, a damaged or displaced image must first undergo a reconsecration ( jirņoddhām , literally a "rescuing of what is worn out"), since "a worn linga that does not undergo the ritual of jirņoddhāra may become a refuge for demons ( Somaśambhupaddhaii 288)." The assumption is that the reduced intensity of divine presence in an untended image creates a vacuum that other less desirable spirits may exploit. Jirņoddhām largely follows the pattern of the original ritual of establishment, without the initial rites of selection and fabrication, but with an additional pacification rite ( sāntihoma ) necessary to expiate any beings or forces that may have entered the object while its guard was down. Before performing this pacification, the priest requests Siva to remove himself temporarily from the object: This linga has become spoiled, O Pervasive One. To rescue it there must be a pacification rite. That is your command. Therefore, O Great Lord and Creator, please remain here, in me [for the duration of this rite] ( Somaśambhupaddhati 289). Once again Siva's animating energy is transposable - this time from the linga or damaged image into the priest's body. After the pacification has purged all obstructive forces from the object, the energy is returned and the priest reenacts the rites of animation, purification, and affusion that initially established the object. The premises underlying jirņoddhām, then, cohere with the Saiva notion of varying levels of divine presence. In icons that have, for whatever reason, gone out of service without suffering grievous physical injury, Siva remains present but only at a general level. The basic identification of image and deity established during initial rites of consecration is not undone, yet mistreatment, erosion, or ritual inattention have brought about a diminishment in Siva's participation. To regain its full ritual status, the image must be subjected to ritual procedures that reestablish Siva's special presence in it. DEFENSIVE BURIAL With the Pathur Natarāja, though, we are dealing with a special type of abandonment: the defensive burial of religious images to protect them from danger ( bhayaraksàrtha ). As the Vimānārcanākalpa advises, When there is danger on account of thieves or enemy armies, and when there is disorder in the community, one should conceal the metal images used for festivals, bathing rites, processions, and balidana (435).</page><page sequence="12">54 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES: 6(1) (WINTER 1992) In such cases images are buried, not because they are considered defunct, but to preserve their ritual lives through threatening times. In the fourteenth century there was indeed danger. Forces of the Delhi Sultanate invaded South India several times and penetrated as far as Madurai, setting up a satrapy that lasted for some forty years. Destruction of major temples and images of the "idola tors" was clearly part of their conquering agenda. In his poetic account of Malik Khan's 1311 campaign, Amir Khusrau depicts the sack of the Cidambaram Nata rāja temple, forty miles from Pathur, as the culminating event of the first invasion. The Mussalmāns destroyed all the lingas. Deo Narāin [Visņu Narayana] fell down, and the other gods, who had fixed their seats there, raised their feet and jumped so high, that at one leap they reached the fort of Lanka; and in that affright the lingas themselves would have fled, had they any legs to stand on (Habib 1931:104). The poet plays here on the immobility of the Šiva-liňga and the reclining posture of the Narayana image and then goes on to describe how the Muslim armies dug up the very foundations of the temple in their search for hidden treasure. In all likelihood it was during this menacing period that the elders and priests of Pathur decided to bury the portable images of the local temple, which Ramamoorthi would stumble upon over five hundred years later. Defensive burial is a ritual procedure, prescribed by the Vaisņava priestly handbook Vitriānarcanakalpa (chap. 70) as it applies to a Visņu temple: In a clean and hidden place the temple priest or worshipper should dig a pit, sprinkle sand in it and strew sacrificial grass over the sand. He worships_the Earth Goddess in the pit, reciting the mantra "Apohistha." Together with the patron and devotees, he enters the sanctum of the god, bows to the deity, and makes a request: "As long as there is danger, o Visņu, please lie down in a bed with the goddess Earth." He transfers the divine energy ( śakti ) located in the image into the fixed image, or in lieu of a fixed image he may transfer the energy into his own heart. Then, accompanying each action with the appropriate mantra, the priest picks up the image, lays it down carefully in the pit, and fills the hole firmly with dirt. Several recent finds of buried images attest to the care with which such entombments were actually carried out in medieval Tamilnad, and the particles of incense ashes among the</page><page sequence="13">DAVIS: LOSS OF RITUAL SELF 55 images affirm that burials were indeed ritual operations (Nagaswamy 1987:1-3). Although Ramamoorthi's haphazard disinterment and reburial of the Pathur images muddied the physical evidence at that burial site, the court findings of geomorphologists who reexamined the area suggest that there too great care had been exercised in burying the objects (United Kingdom High Court 1988:62). When an image is buried, the priest returns to the temple, where he prepares a kurca, a bundle made of fifty stalks of sacrificial grass. Then "he invokes the animating spirit (jíva) out of the fixed image and into the grass bundle, and worships the bundle." Henceforward, the bundle is treated much as an image would be, receiving appropriate pūjā offerings, and every month it is replaced with a new bundle into which the jíva is transferred. The kūrca serves as the temporary substitute embodiment for the divine presence, and one not likely to excite the wrath of iconoclasts or the avarice of thieves. If all had gone well above ground, the Pathur images would have been dug up as soon as the coast was clear, cleaned with tamarind, and subjected to a rather lengthy reconsecration, just as a worn or fallen image would be. As the Vimānarcarīākalpa prescribes, the priest then would return the image to the sanctum, chant over it the same mantras used to establish it in the first place, and finally transfer the divine energy out of the fixed image back into the resurrected one. This procedure apparently happened at the Vaisņava temple in Kannanur, Tamilnad. There a fifteenth century inscription records that "the Visņu image from the temple, which had been hidden away due to the Muhammadan invasion, was reconsecrated and restored to its place of glory" (Dehejia 1990:123). But evidently something occurred in Pathur that prevented a timely disinterment of the temple images. Lengthy burial, however, is not necessarily an impediment to ritual restoration. There does not appear to be any statute of limitations where Śiva is concerned. We have, for instance, the happy example of Esalam, Tamilnad, where villagers engaged in temple renovations recently uncovered a treasure-trove of twenty-three bronzes, ritual utensils, and a copper-plate inscription, also buried probably in the fourteenth century. After reporting the find to the local officials, they placed all the objects inside the temple and spontaneously made provisional preparations for their worship, clothing and garlanding them and offering camphor (F. L'Hernault, letter, August 1991). Soon after, news of the find reached the attention of R. Nagaswamy, then Director of the Tamilnad State Department of Archaeology, who quickly set out for the site. He reports: On seeing us, the entire village over 2000 people - both men and women - thronged to the temple.

Unfortunately Nagaswamy does not describe just what these arrangements for worship were. Obviously, the people of Esalam did not believe that these long-buried images were no longer suitable for worship. The capacity to serve as divine support need not be effaced even after 600 years underground. IMAGES AMONG UNTOUCHABLES There is one additional complication to the case of the Pathur Nata rāja, however. Not only was the image buried and dug up, it was also forcibly removed from its native place, handled by a string of unsavory characters, and finally relocated in a highly alien setting, the British Museum's department of conservation. This situation was not entirely foreseen by medieval ritual texts, but they do provide one relevant principle. According to some priestly texts, contact with an "untouchable" makes an icon unsuitable for further religious use, and the Pathur Nata rāja has certainly suffered from many impure hands during its journey. To deal with this difficulty we need to consider the testimony of another type of text, which will return us to the initial question of whether life persists in decontextualized ritual objects. The chronicles of śri Ranganātha, the most renowned Vaisnava temple in Tamilnad, recount the peregrinations of another image displaced during Malik Khan's fourteenth century campaign in the south (Hari Rao 1961:24-31). Malik, it seems, looted Alakiyamanavâlan (Visnu the "handsome bridegroom"), the main processional deity of the temple, and took it back to Delhi with him, where he threw it unceremoniously into the palace storeroom. The Sultan's daughter saw the Visnu image there and took it to her bedroom as a plaything. During the day she would play with it as a doll, but at night the Lord would reveal to her the full splendor of his vibhava manifestation. Meanwhile, an old woman from Sri Rangam had followed the image as it was carried north and posed as a servant woman to gain entry to the palace. When she saw Visnu being treated like a toy, she returned to Sri Rangam and reported this alarming news to the temple authorities. After burying the image of Visņu's consort under a bilva tree and locking up the temple, they travelled in a party of sixty persons to Delhi. At Malik's palace the temple musicians and dancers performed for the Sultan, pleasing him so much that he offered them a boon. They left with their image.</page><page sequence="16">58 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES: 6(1) (WINTER 1992) Deprived of her handsome idol, the Sultani followed after the temple group, but she was unable to recapture the image and eventually died from unrequited devotion. The image was finally returned to Sri Rangam after fifty-nine years and many additional adventures. During this time a replacement image had been consecrated in its stead. All the temple priests who had once attended the Alakiyamanavalan. image had died, and the current authorities were suspicious of the newcomer's claim to authenticity. To settle the matter the local ruler was forced to adopt a novel curatorial method. He located a 93-year-old, blind, temple washerman who in his youth used to drink the sacred water that dripped from the clothes of the idol after its daily bath. The king had both images, original and replacement, bathed and gave the two wet cloths to the old washerman. The blind man immediately recognized the nectar-like water from the old image, exclaiming "He is our God!" And so the king reinstalled the long-absent image in the sanctum of the Śri Rańganatha temple. The ontological premise here, as with the procedures for recovery of untended images, is that a continuing latent divine presence subsists in a displaced image, even among the "untouchable" Turks of Delhi. Potency is not extinguished even in a Muslim court, nor presumably in a British court of law. In the right circumstances that presence can be brought out fully. In this narrative it is devotional fervor rather than priestly ritual that is credited with kindling Visņu's presence into a more dazzling pitch. Indeed, such devotion may be found even among such unlikely candidates as a blind washerman or a Muslim princess. As with the processional image of Śri Rańganatha, it now appears likely that Śiva will be able to reembody himself in the Pathur Natarāja. In February 1988, after a 44-day trial, Justice Ian Kennedy decided in favor of šiva and the other plaintiffs, that their claims to proprietorship of the Pathur Natarāja were more compelling than those of the Bumper Corporation and that the image should therefore be returned to Tamilnad. Not content with the ruling, the defendants petitioned the case first to the Court of Appeals and then to the House of Lords, arguing that law in England is adjudicated in the name of Christianity and the Queen, and that foreign gods had no part to play in the process. As I write this in May 1991, the House of Lords has refused to accept their appeal, thereby accepting šiva's participation in post- colonial British justice. Arrangements are being made for the physical return of the Natarāja to India, and we can only hope that suitable provisions will also be made in Tamilnad for its ritual reestablishment in a Saiva temple. When we look at an Indian image in a Western museum, we may think we are looking at a simple material art object. From the Hindu point of view, however, we are looking at something like ash-covered</page><page sequence="17">DAVIS: LOSS OF RITUAL SELF 59 embers, a latent divine presence that is generally obscured to us by its circumstances and the limitations of our own vision. Yet the embers themselves are not extinguished. Such images may occasionally seduce us, as Alakiyamanavalan did the Sultani, and evoke in us a devotional response more intense than the lachrymose reflections of the Parthenon sculptures in Hardy's poem might suggest. But more satisfyingly, those embers can still be rekindled also through proper ritual action, whereby a repatriated image regains the full ritual selfhood conferred upon it by the animating energy that has at all times been present within it. After a court case in London that consumed forty-four working days and cost much more than the sale price of the bronze, the Pathur Natarāja became greater celebrity as a litigated commodity than it had ever been as a consecrated temple image. And so, when returned to Tamilnad on August 9, 1991, it was honored with political ceremony suitable to its new status as an icon in the cultural politics of art repatriation. The function took place at the Secretariat in Fort St. George, Madras, seat of the Tamilnad State Government. The Indian High Commissioner in the U.K., Dr. L.M. Singhvi, presented the image - decked out once again in flowers and silk garment - to the Tamilnad Chief Minister, Ms. Jayalalitha, and she lit two bronze lamps before it to mark the grateful acceptance of the Government and people of Tamilnad. Both Singhvi and Jayalalitha spoke of the importance of the case in setting precedents that would aid India in retaining and regaining its cultural heritage. As Jayalalitha hopefully put it, the restoration of the Pathur Natarāja marked the end of the era in which "our priceless cultural treasures have been plundered by foreign countries and we have been forced, through circumstances, to bear all this in silence ( Indian Express 10 August 1991)." The Chief Minister also presented Natarāja mementoes to fifteen officials who had participated in the effort to retrieve the object. One problem remained: the Sri Visvanathaswamy Temple in Pathur was not open for worship. Renovation work was proceeding apace, though, and Jayalalitha promised that the consecration ( kumbhābhiseka ) of the temple would take place within six months, at which time the Pathur Natarāja could complete its long journey by being reconsecrated in its newly-rebuilt old home.
