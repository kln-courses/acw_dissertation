Pp. xiv-88. $4.50. The complete Isaiah scroll from Qumran (lQIsaa) has been the subject of a variety of textual studies in the past 20 years. J. R. Rosenbloom lists E. Y. Kutscher's Language and Linguistic Background of the Isaiah Scroll (in Hebrew, 1959). He has used BH3 with its separate apparatus by O. Eissfeldt of variant readings from the manuscript. He does not list M. H. Goshen- Gottstein's three important articles in Bib 34-35 (1953-1954), nor J. Ziegler's study on LXX contacts of the scroll in JBL 78 (1959). After these studies, it is difficult to see what the present discursive and largely ineffectual analysis of "every major variant of the MS ... as well as many minor ones" adds to our knowledge, whether of MT or of the scroll itself. Seemingly, because MT's consonants are taken as a norm from which lQIsaa,s deviations are allowed no independent value, significant variants which are a matter of vowel letters are omitted by R. Thus 2:3 wywrwnw, where the plural verb finds an echo in LXX of the parallel passage Mie 4:2. Again, 5:17, kbwšym, where LXX also read a participle (though not from kbs) in place of kbsym, "lambs." Again, 9:5 and (with suprascript waw) 9:6 mśwrh , the reading of Aquila; compare Ezek 4:11,16. Discussions of lQIsaa often do not respect adequately the spacing between words or groups of words which the MS exhibits. Thus, despite R. and the New English Bible , the scroll at 6:13 with its spacing before bmh is clearly at variance with S. Iwry's reconstruction. At 8:23, k't hryswn, where MT has no spacing and LXX makes a paragraph break between the words, it would be useful to know that the scroll divides sharply before these words. At 9:6 (see the Stuttgart Biblia hebraica) y the scroll does not simply offer the qere Imrbh but leaves a space after the medial mem, reflecting the same ambiguity as MT's ketxb (which em- ploys a final mem with no space after it before the resh). At 14:4, the photograph</page><page sequence="2">462 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 33 shows sb for sbt to be an illusory reading ; the taw is concealed in a fold produced by the stitching that repairs a long vertical tear within that column. In 5:8, the scroll's wyštm is best explained as a scribal error for the wyšbtm of other wit- nesses. In 1:20, the Targum and the Syriac agree with the scroll's bhrb, and R.'s dis- cussion (based on Kittel in BH3) is faulty. The scroll's plurals in 1:23b follow a harmonizing tendency evidenced here by LXX, Syr., Targ., Vulg. ; the rela- tionship might have been noted. Opposition to anthropomorphism will not ex- plain, in 3:11 or elsewhere, the scroll's variation between -w and ~yw in suffixed forms. Its practice is not the (sometimes inconsistent) MT practice; to account for what the scroll has, the reviewer would suppose that there was no difference in pronunciation for this copyist between the forms we transcribe as yãdô and yãdã(y)w, respectively. Aramaic intrusions like m'swhy, 10:12, point in this direction. At 3:11, Prov 12:14 ketib is pertinent; at 8:18, the Syriac, the Vulgate, and Deut 28:46 are. The two variants in 8:11 are supported by Aquila, Symmachus, and the Syriac, and R.'s discussion lacks historical perspective. For 14:4, mrhbh, H. M. Orlinsky's treatment, which R. repeats, has been demolished by H. L. Ginsberg in J AOS 88 (1968) 53. R.'s Greek at this point has been badly proofread. In 16:9, the ta dendra sou of the Greek shows the scroll's 'rzyk is not simply an error by its copyist. All in all, useful perspectives on 1Q Isaa call for a broader range of sidelights on the scroll than R.'s study can furnish. Patrick W.
