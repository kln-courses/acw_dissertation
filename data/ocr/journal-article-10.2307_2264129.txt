<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ENGLISH TEACHER AND INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS Edward L. Anderson Educators and leading laymen of many countries are currently much concerned with something called "the improvement of intercultural relations." This is by no means a new interest dating from the end of the Second World War, but the aims and pro- grams of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization have made for an increased awareness of the gen- eral problem of intercultural relations, and a more active desire to do something to improve them. Let us first seek a clear under- standing of what the term "intercultural relations" means, and then ask ourselves what makes for "bad" or unsatisfactory inter- cultural relations. Then, perhaps, we can suggest a program for the English teacher to follow, or at least a set of guiding princi- ples, in his attempt to improve such relations. The term "intercultural relations" would appear to embrace at least three kinds of social relationships. First, there are the rela- tionships between groups of different racial or national back- grounds, whites and Negroes, Chinese and Jews, Italians and Ger- mans. The term "national" is to be preferred here to "racial," as modern science has demonstrated quite successfully the gross fal- lacies of our older nations concerning "'race" and "blood." With the possible exception of some primitive culture groups in certain parts of the world, there do not exist anywhere among so-called civilized peoples any group which are "racially pure," so exten- sive have been the processes of immigration and interbreeding. Second, there are the relationships between groups adhering to different religious beliefs. These differences frequently occur between groups who function together in larger national or poli- tical groups. Third, there are the relationships between different socioeconomic groups, that is, between groups which in our 140</page><page sequence="2">ENGLISH TEACHER AND INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS 141 society form quite distinct social communities on the basis of differences in their incomes, occupations, and educations. What makes for tension in any such intercultural relations? Let us examine an actual instance of such tension. In the summer of I943 there was what the press called a "race riot" involving Negroes and whites in Detroit, Michigan. After several days of street fights, thirty-odd persons, chiefly Negroes, had been killed, several hundred injured, and windows had been smashed in hun- dreds of stores and houses in both white and Negro neighbor- hoods. Order was restored only after a detachment of the United States Army had been sent into the city to aid the local police. I believe that there is probably a complex of causes, rather than a single cause, for every particular case of tension between groups. There are, however, some factors which appear to play their parts in many of these cases, whether they result in violent eruption of the kind just noted or not. First, it seems that a good many inter- group tensions have their seed beds in an old and widespread tendency of human behavior, namely, the need of the individual to feel himself a "belonging" member of a "we-group," and his willingness to accept uncritically the opinions and attitudes of his group toward "they-groups" or "out-groups" in order to maintain his own status. Second, this need and this willingness make for a perpetuation of ignorance and erroneous "knowledge" about what the members of out-groups are like, and for the contin- ued acceptance of stereotypes. Third, socioeconomic competition between groups may make for the acceptance of unfavorable stereotypes and a shutting of the mind to new or corrected facts about the out-group. I believe that the third factor mentioned, socioeconomic com- petition (for example, that existing between poor whites and Negroes in certain places in the United States), is one about which the teacher can, as an individual, do very little. I do not think the teacher, English teacher or otherwise, can do very much to alter</page><page sequence="3">142 THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL SOCIOLOGY the first factor-the tendency on the part of the individual, to accept the opinions and attitudes of his own we-group. What, then, can the teacher do? It would appear that the teacher must concentrate his efforts on the second of the three factors, namely, on the elimination of the ignorance and erroneous "knowledge" about what the members of out-groups are like and on the correc- tion of the previously accepted stereotypes. If this is so, how can the English teacher, in particular, move toward such elimination and correction? It is with this question that we will be concerned. English teachers can build a reading program based on the literatures drawn from or dealing with the different backgrounds of the students who make up their school population. I will not attempt here to offer suggested reading lists but, instead, will state what I consider to be an important criterion for the selection of such literature. Let us suppose a school situation in which white and Negro students are associated and in which some of the white students fear, distrust, or otherwise dislike the Negroes. What kind of reading can the white students be encouraged to do to help eradicate this dislike, particularly when it is based on ignor- ance or on faulty stereotypes concerning Negroes? Certainly liter- ature which fortifies existing stereotypes of the Negro as childlike, eternally adolescent, lazy, unreliable, or, worse yet, as criminally inclined, is to be avoided. The reading of books and short stories about Negroes of the Octavus Roy Cohen type, in which they are represented as being fond of gaudy pretentiousness, addicted to scheming dishonesty, and afflicted (as in the case of Florian Slap- pey) with a congenital aversion to honest labor, is not calculated to eliminate these stereotypes. Marc Connelly's The Green Pas- tures, although it is a quite charming fantasy, intensifies the con- ception of Negroes as intellectually and emotionally childlike. (One may well ask whether the role of "de Lawd" in this play as a prosperous, fatherly Negro who smokes ten-cent "ceegars" is any more anthropomorphic than some widely held notions about</page><page sequence="4">ENGLISH TEACHER AND INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS 143 the nature of the Deity still current among some otherwise sophis- ticated white people.) Again, stories of the Joel Chandler Harris Uncle Remus variety picture the Negro as fairly reveling in a sub- servient status. Although scarce by comparison with what we may call "stereotype literature" about the Negroes, it is still possible to find literature which presents them as quite normal human beings, faced with the same basic problems of existence as other human beings, and behaving in general as other human beings do, or would do, in similar situations. Richard Wright's Black Boy records the struggles of a sensitive, intelligent Negro boy to achieve and to maintain the status of a free, self-respecting man in a society, both Negro and white, which seemed bent on "keeping him in his place." Mrs. Palmer's Honey by Fannie Cook tells a similar story about a Negro girl. And, of course, Wright's Native Son is excellent as the story of a young Negro trapped by the criminal stereotype of the Negro held by a large part of the society about him. Let English teachers, then, stimulate their students to reading and discussion of literature about minority or special culture groups, which avoids centering its emphasis on faulty stereotypes, faulty in the sense that traits possessed perhaps by some, are attributed to the majority, and which does present the members of such groups as human beings with the same tendencies, hopes, fears, and problems that characterize the rest of the human race, or at least a sizable portion of it. The word "discussion" in the preceding sentence is important. I believe that merely preparing lists of such "culturally realistic" literature (as opposed to "stereo- type" literature), making such reading available, and perhaps encouraging the actual reading of it by requiring written or oral book reports, is not enough. A good English teacher, aware of the desirability of correcting the erroneous conceptions about certain groups of people held by some of his students, can conduct class- room discussion of this better kind of literature in which its</page><page sequence="5">144 THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL SOCIOLOGY greater honesty and insight can be profitably contrasted with the easy typing of people so characteristic of the other sort. The teacher needs tact and good common sense to conduct such discussion without hurting some students' feelings or subjecting them to embarrassment. He can stimulate the students to identify the stereotypes they hold, to ask themselves the reasons for, and the sources of, these stereotypes, and finally to correct them in the light of what they have read and heard discussed in class. There is another phase of the work in the English class which the English teacher can utilize for the furtherance of better inter- cultural relations. This is the general area of the group project and individual report work. Teachers who want ideas on how effec- tively this phase of English teaching can be handled would do well to read English for Social Living by Gordon, Kaulfers, and Kefauver (Stanford University Press) in which a number of teachers on the junior-high, senior-high, and junior-college levels present accounts of class activity programs. Here again, I am not undertaking to offer suggestions for specific programs or activities, but rather to indicate a general principle to follow in the conduct of such activities. The English teacher should avoid assigning a task to a student from a minority group which that student is incapable of per- forming with reasonable competence, or in the performance of which the student will be made to appear ineffective, unsuccessful, or "funny" to his classmates. If a girl from a "foreign" back- ground reads aloud poorly and with a marked accent, she should not be required to read papers or make oral reports before the class, until or unless the teacher can bring her reading and speech habits up to an acceptable level for that particular group. The same girl may have artistic talent which, if called upon instead, may emphasize her as highly competent in the eyes of her fellow students. A shy, awkward boy from another minority group may make himself, and others of his group, "inferior" in the opinion</page><page sequence="6">ENGLISH TEACHER AND INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS 145 of his fellows if called upon for individual performance. The same boy may be very apt, however, at gathering data from reading or observation and in writing them up in a good piece of written English. Let this boy do that, and the teacher or another student present the report to the class. I do not cherish the hope that the problem of intercultural rela- tionships is going to be solved, and the millennium attained over- night, if every English teacher seeks for "culturally realistic" liter- ature for reading and class discussion and pays due consideration to his students' aptitudes and personality problems, however, I do believe that these are intelligent procedures which, carried out by a host of individual teachers, can have some cumulative effect on the improvement of intergroup relations in the English classes of our schools.
