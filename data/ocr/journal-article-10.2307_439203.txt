<plain_text><page sequence="1">Revision and Romantic Authorship. Zachary Leader. Oxford: Claren- don Press, 1996. Pp. ix+354. Although nobody will confess any longer to believing in the Romantic myth of the inspired poet, many of us continue to act as though we did. Seeking to track imagination to its source, we crave editions of earlier and still earlier versions of Romantic texts; we demand to know what poems and novels looked like or would have looked like before officious friends, advisers, and editors interfered with them; we resent the com- promises attendant upon literary marriages; and we wish befuddled elderly (or even middle-aged) poets had had the sense to leave the products of their visionary youth alone. Gulled by remarks that William Wordsworth and others let drop about the nature of inspiration, we have preferred the spontaneous overflow to the judicious mopping up. We have glorified the imagination in its adolescent solitude, indifferent to all but its own self-gratification, and we have deprecated its mature socialization. We have erred. So suggests Zachary Leader in a book designed as both indictment and corrective. Reminding us that Wordsworth's words about the spon- taneous overflow of powerful feeling and John Keats's likening of poetic origination to the budding of the leaves on a tree misrepresent Romantic theory and practice alike, Leader shows how important revi- sion and its interpersonal analogue, collaboration, were even to those Romantics who most consistently affected to despise them. Discussing Wordsworth, Lord Byron, Samuel Coleridge, the Shelleys, John Clare, and Keats, reminding us that composition is work and that poets and even editors labor, Leader demonstrates how many second thoughts and second opinions went into Romantic writings. Although revision means different things in different literary con- texts, as does the prejudice against revision, Leader finds that attitudes toward revision reflect attitudes toward the self and the continuity it</page><page sequence="2">290 MODERN PHILOLOGY images. A poet may (like Wordsworth) revise out of courage, in order to insist-and in insisting make it true-that, despite death and time and the subtler processes of loss, he remains whole and one with his past self; or he may (like Coleridge) revise out of desperation, hoping to beat down suspicions about his own disintegration. He may (like Keats) follow his friends' advice and revise in order to sidestep critical hostility and audience suspicion, or (like Mary Shelley) admit a hus- band's corrections in the belief that a book needs more parenting than a single author can provide. He may refuse to revise because (like Clare) he cares less for the poetry he produces than for the activity of its pro- duction and knows that somebody else will clean his texts up for him, or because (like Byron) he dislikes to be seen to be taking pains and delights in the image of his own aristocratic carelessness. And a critic may refuse to acknowledge the importance of revision either because of a modern distaste for finish (a distaste that confesses its descent from the Romantic fascination with the fragment) or else because of an attach- ment to the aging Romantic fetish of organic unity. For all its openmindedness about the various interpretive possibili- ties of its topic, Revision and Romantic Authorship occasionally veers to- ward a chronologically inverted fundamentalism, a crabby suspicion of any but the last-written versions of texts. At its most sputtery, the book can sound like a defense of aged property holders, old men exercising their right to dispose as they please of the works of their youth-and for Leader it is their youth, the older men standing in relation to their younger selves as proprietors to property or perhaps as spokesmen to a crowd. So if the elderly Wordsworth preferred later versions of the Pre- lude (begun 1799, completed 1805, published 1850) or "The Ruined Cottage" to his earlier ones-and the proof of authorial preference is publication-then it is clear in Leader's mind that it is the later one that ought to be printed. Nor is there room for both early and late; re- jecting textual pluralism, Leader insists that we (by which he means publishing houses and easily bored undergraduates) can spare neither the attention nor the money for more than a single text. He finds it un- just that the profligate issue of early versions should come at the expense of the legitimate, the "nominated," work. Not everything in the book is so crotchety, however. While hostile both to the primitivism of the Cornell Wordsworth and to the sentimen- tal condescension of an Oxford Clare that (as he neatly, wittily, alto- gether persuasively shows) returns that poet's verse to its original but generally rustic errors, Leader is too sophisticated to prefer automati- cally all later versions to all early ones, or even all authors to all editors. Not all authors are to be regarded as authorities on their own work, nor do all works deserve the editorial preservation of their authorial chas- tity; the authorial intentions most worthy of respect are those that</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 291 themselves respect the stations of their development, and the revisions most worthy of publication are those that own and acknowledge those earlier intentions. Poet or editor, one who disowns or abandons or be- lies original intentions violates a relationship akin to that which under- lies the integrity of psychic identity or a familial tie. The exceptions to this rule are merely ostensible; in one of the most engaging chapters in the book, Leader shows how the insouciant digressiveness of Don Juan (1819-24), a penchant for inconsequence he describes as "a form of in- ternal revision" (p. 102), works to project an absolutely fixed identity- works, that is, to protect the very consistency it seems to devalue. As Leader himself concedes, not all revisions make a measurable difference in the power and beauty of the texts they affect, and some- times their effects are so mixed that it is difficult to say whether they count as improvements or not. Indeed, improvement and deteriora- tion are perhaps beside the point here: Revision and Romantic Authorship is more a defense of the practice of revision than a neutral consider- ation of its literary value. Zealous in defense of the principle, Leader is thus willing sometimes to overlook a little poetic bungling. In any case, political and religious loyalties, issues of general social interest, concern him more nearly than poetics, and he assumes that they preoccupy others to the same extent. Thus he interprets critical unhappiness with Coleridge's later writings as ideological disagreement and defends the poet against the charge of ideological self-betrayal, as if the political question subsumed the poetic-a simplification that may leave some readers unconvinced. It is as human action, the expression of human connection, that revi- sion matters most here. The publication of an unauthorized version of a text, the dismissal of a writer's revisions, perplexes the fidelity that is so deep a concern in this book-fidelity to oneself, fidelity to the past, fidelity to the text, its author, and their understanding of their own integrity. This is a particularly sore point with Leader, who gets person- ally obnoxious about it, challenging Stephen Parrish, general editor of the Cornell Wordsworth, to say how he would like it if some editor treated him the way he treats Wordsworth-how, that is, he would like having his own early writings on editing Wordsworth anthologized as more authentic or more truly representative of the Parrishian approach than his later reconsiderations of the same subject. Leader is bothered by more than simply the threat such editorial practices pose to the right of authors to determine the works by which they will be judged; as far as he is concerned, disregarding the authority of a final version is (as Herbert Lindenberger put it) like disregarding a last will and testament. It is a crime committed against a helpless victim, an act of violence against the words through which he attempts to escape the otherwise unbreakable silence of death.</page><page sequence="4">292 MODERN PHILOLOGY The analogy says more about Leader's distress at the idea of editorial malpractice than about his conception of revision: he drops the ana- logy almost as soon as he introduces it. But the impulse behind it, the larger analogy of which it is a passing symptom, reappears. For Revi- sion and Romantic Authorship thinks by textual anthropomorphism. In Leader's model, according to which texts are like selves, books can be like people, and literary relations can be understood as social and even familial. Judgments about people and the propriety of their relations with one another take the place of the literary judgments one might have expected. This version of textual ethics can take surprising turns. If one agrees that to be an author is to be a parent, then a text is a child toward whom the parent has special responsibilities. Children need parents (preferably in the plural) who will continue to care for them. Continuing authorial care expresses itself as revision. According to the family-values model of authorship, then, the ideal text is the product of a marriage of authors/ parents working in collaboration over an extended period of time, maturing by responsible revision. An example of such an ideal text, for Leader, is Frankenstein, which happens also to be a tale about the dangers of irresponsible single parenting and the abandonment of children-a tale suggesting an allegory, Leader finds, of the evils of the traditional model of authorship. For a work on such a subject, Revision and Romantic Authorship feels strangely unrevised, uneven, unfinished. Argument is sometimes sketchy, a matter of historical recitation or even mere assertion; fragments of discussions metastasize and appear where one would least expect them, obstructive rather than helpful; contradictions or at least appar- ent contradictions abound. The book is valuable nonetheless, not only as a counterpoise to current editorial fashion, not only as a collection of sometimes winning essays, but also as a reminder of the unglamor- ously human realities of Romantic writing and the necessarily human obligations those realities impose on us.
