Description of the Mount of Olives1 ABOUT two miles north of Jerusalem just south of the village of a a a Sa'fat, a range of mountains detaches itself from the backbone of the Judean hills and runs south-east to the peak called Scopus. Then the ridge turns almost directly south until opposite the temple mount where it swings to the south-south-west and proceeds in that direction until the confluence of the Kidron and Hinnom valleys separates the ridge from the Hill of Evil Counsel, which is directly south of the city. "The Mount of Olives" is a general term for the series of peaks in this ridge east of the city of Jerusalem. The change of direction from south-east to south occurs at a dip over which passes the ancient road to Anathoth. Just south of this pass is the mountain now called Scopus, but more properly called Sir John Gray hill, since "Scopus" originally was a name applied to a hill west of this rise. The hill here rises to an elevation of 2690 feet above sea level. Over Scopus passes the northern branch of the road to Jericho which follows Wady Rawâbeh to the east. South of the hill is another depression which separates Scopus from a broad plateau on which now stands the building of the Kaiserin Augusta Victoria Stiftung. The next peak to the south rises to a height of 2684 feet and is called Viri Galilaei or locally Karm es-Sayyâd and Karm Abul-Hawâ. Directly south lies the Mount of Olives in the narrowest sense of the name, for the next peak is the one directly east of the temple mount. On this 2636 foot hill is the traditional site of the ascension of Jesus and here stands the Church of the Ascension. This locale overlooks the city for it is about 100 feet above Jerusalem and 400 feet above the Kidron valley, which separates the mountain from the city. On the west slope of this rise is the traditional location of Gethsemane. This central peak has two spurs. Directly east is a rise to 2664 feet. On this point stands the 1 This description is based on material found in Encyclopaedia Biblica, vol. Ill, cc. 3496 ff.; The International Standard Bible Encylopaedia, vol.

To the south-south-west of the traditional ascension peak is the other spur, now called Prophets, because of some catacombs found there and attributed to the prophets. After another dip the range, tending to the south-south-west, rises to its final peak, Gebel Batn el-Hawâ. This 2395 foot height is traditionally called the Mount of Offense, for it is thought to be the high place to the south of הר המשחית on which Solomon built the sanctuaries to foreign gods (I Kings 11. 11.7; 11.7; II Kings 23.13). Directly west of the peak, the Kidron and Hinnom valleys join as one and proceed south-south-east between the Mount of Offense and the Hill of Evil Counsel. This ridge of hills is separated from Jerusalem by the Kidron Valley which begins as a depression on the level of Jerusalem at a point directly north of the city. This valley proceeds almost due east until it comes to the western face of Sir John Gray hill. Then with several curves the cleft proceeds almost due south. In its course the vale drops sharply into a ravine 300 feet deeper than the city and 400 feet deeper than the eastern ridge. The distance across the valley from the city to the mountain is to % of a mile. The Arabic name of this cleft is interesting; it is called Wâdy en-Nâr, "Valley of Fire." There is from the Ascension peak a ridge that slopes to the east away from Olivet toward the wilderness. On this slope lies the village of el-'Azarëyeh, the modern name for Bethany. In general, the eastern slopes of the mountain drop quite sharply toward the wilderness, the Jordan valley, and the Dead Sea. The range itself is geologically hard cretaceous limestone, super imposed with strata of soft cretaceous limestone, with quaternary deposits on the summits. There is every reason to believe that the eastern slopes of the mountain were given over to arboriculture since ancient times. The prevailing northwesterly wind presents the major problem to such activity, but the mass of the ridge affords comparative shelter to the eastern face. The chalky limestone breaks down into excellent soil for the growth of various trees, and thus cultivation seems logical on the now largely denuded slopes. The names הר הזיתים (or מעלה) and בית פגי (house of figs), together with Bethany (if it means "house of dates," as usually proposed2), all indicate arboriculture on the hills. If Neh. 8.15, as seems likely, refers to the Mount of Olives, we have another reason for assuming that these slopes in ancient times were covered with every sort of tree necessary for the building of sukkoth. 2 Abbott-Smith, Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament, p. 80.</page><page sequence="3">[3] THE MOUNT OF OLIVES IN TRADITION 139 II.II. The Mount of Olives in the Old Testament The specific references to the Mount of Olives in the Old Testament are probably only six in number. In each instance the passage is fraught with religious significance; but in general this significance is only tantalizingly suggested rather than specifically stated. The first mention of the mountain east of Jerusalem is in II Sam. 15.30. This is in the midst of the story of David's flight from the city at the revolt of Absalom. The king was going up the Ascent of Olives (מעלה הזיתים) and was showing open and violent grief — weeping, going barefoot, and with his head covered. The most surprising feature of the narrative is that we are told that he came to a place where he customarily worshipped 3.אלהים We immediately wonder about the reference of אלהים. Is this term supposed to refer to Yahweh or to another god or gods? If this is correctly understood as a customary place of worship, why do we have no previous mention in the OT of such practice? We find no answer to these questions. (See below, pp. 168 f., for further consideration of this passage). A second reference to the Mount of Olives is contained in the record of the apostasy of Solomon, where the king is blamed, among other sins, for having built a high place to Kemôs, the "abomination" of Moab, and to Môlek, the "abomination" of the sons of Ammon, on the mountain which is before Jerusalem (בהר אשר על־פני ירושלם I Kings 11.7).4 There is no reference to an earlier cult practiced on the mountain, nor is there reason given for the choice of this place as a sanctuary for such foreign gods. Though there is no specific statement, this cult must have persisted uninterrupted for centuries, for one of the glorious achievements of Josiah was that he destroyed and dese crated this sanctuary (II Kings 23.13). The historian at this place varies from the account in I Kings 11.7 in that he says there were במות rather than במה present and in that he finds 'Astoret worshipped there as well as Kemôs and Milkôm (מלבם here for the טלר of I Kings 11.7). Whether we are to say that each deity had his separate במה, or whether we are to understand that the במה of 'AStôret was apart from the במה of Kemô§ and Milkôm is not certain. In either case, the ardent worshipper of Yahweh found the cult an alien and hostile rival 3 In II Sam. 15.32a we read ויהי דוד בא עד הראש אשר ישתחוה שם לאלהים. The impf. of ישתחוה must here be meant to express customary procedure, for there is no sugges tion in the text that David pauses in his flight to worship any god. יי That אשר על פני may mean "east of," follows from Gen. 25.18; Deut. 32.49; Josh. 13.3, 25, et al.</page><page sequence="4">140 JOHN BRIGGS CURTIS [4] of the pure worship of the God of Israel. We would like to know the nature, the significance and the popularity of this religion, but again our sources are obscure and only suggestive. A peculiar feature of the place of the במות should be noted. These are described ואת־הבמות אשר על־פני ירושלם אשר מימין להר־המשחית (II Kings 23.13)• This seems to mean that the sanctuaries were to the south of — or more probably, on the south slope of a peak called הר־המשחית. Such a place can only be one of the summits of the Mount of Olives. Traditional translations (KJV; ASV; RSV; cf. Jerome, mons offensionis) have taken משחית to be an abstract noun meaning "corruption."5 Thus the term was con sidered a circumlocution for a place profaned by the worship of a foreign deity. Actually משחית is not a regular abstract noun derived from שחת "to ruin" but is a Hiphil participle of שחת which means in the active causative "to destroy"; the participle then must be "the destroyer." To this term we must later return. A further mention of the Mount of Olives is found in one of the visions of Ezekiel, which is a rather lengthy picture of the sin of Jerusalem and the consequent punishment therefor (Ezek. 8-11). Once the spirit of Yahweh had pronounced the final doom of the city and its inhabitants, the glory of Yahweh (כבוד יהרה) left the city and went to stand on the mountain east of the city (על־ההר אשר מקדם לעיר Ezek. 11.23). With this decisive act, the vision concludes. The exact sig nificance of the retirement to the Mount of Olives is not stated. Ezra and his associates, in their revival of Yahwism, derive from the law of Moses the command: צאו ההר והביאו עלי־זית ועלי־עץ שמן ועלי הדס ועלי תמרים ועלי עץ עבת לעשת סכת ככתוב (Neh. 8.15)• The reference of ההר could very naturally be to the Mount of Olives, especially in view of the kind of boughs to be gathered for the building of the booths. However, certainty is not really possible. The apocalyptic visions of the book of Zechariah furnish the final reference to the mountain. On some great day, it is foreseen, the Jews will be violently defeated, plundered, and exiled by a great alliance of hostile nations. But when all hope of human endeavor has failed, Yahweh will go forth and do battle with the enemies of his people. s Another suggestion as to the meaning of הו־־המשחית is that the term טשחית is to be considered a term for "oil" or is paronomastic use of a term similar to the term for oil משחה. For the shades of interpretation of this point of view, see Georg Hoffman, "Kleinigkeiten," ZAW II, 1882, p. 175; B. Stade and F. Schwally, The Sacred Boohs of of the Old Testament, Part 9, The Book of Kings, p. 295; and E. Nestle's review of F. Perles, Analekten zur Textkritik des Alten Testaments, Theologische Literaturzeitung, vol. 21, no. 5 (Feb. 29,1896), c. 129. That the rabbis recognized a demon of destruction named משחית is seen from Deut. Rab. 3:11.</page><page sequence="5">[5] THE MOUNT OF OLIVES IN TRADITION 141 Then Yahweh will stand upon the Mount of Olives, and it shall be cleft in half from east to west. A very great valley will appear as half the mountain moves to the south and half to the north (Zech. 14.1-4). The vision continues, but the next verse is not clear. In vs. 4 we have the only occurrences of the name Mount of Olives (הר הזיתים) in the OT. This term is modified by the doubly redundant אשר על־פני ירושלם מקדם; but this repetition makes more certain what was already clear — that ההר אשר על־פני ירושלם is nothing but the Mount of Olives. What we should really like to know is why the cleft occurred, but the text gives not the slightest indication. III. The Term המשחית in the Old Testament Since the Mount of Olives is designated in II Kings 23.13 by the term הר המשחית, it is necessary to examine the meaning of this name. The term משחית, both inflected and uninflected, occurs about 35 times in the OT.6 The majority of these instances are rather colorless, but the determined המשחית occurs but 7 times and is rather interesting. It has already been noted that in II Kings 23.13 the Mount of Olives is called הר־המשחיתהר־המשחית "the mountain of the destroyer." The same term occurs in reference to Babylon in Jer. 51.25: הנני אליך הר המשחית נאם־יהוה המשחית " ,את־כל־הארץ ונטיתי את־ידי עליך וגלגלתיך מן־הסלעים ונתתיך להר שרפה 'Be hold, I am against you, 0 mountain of the destroyer, which destroys all the earth,' says Yahweh; 'and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will roll you from the crags, and I will make you a mountain of burning.' " It might be pure coincidence that the terms coincide; but if the author had meant to describe Babylon as "the destroying mountain," it seems that he would have written ההר המשחית. The writer rather seems to have taken Babylon as having some special relation to someone who could be characterized as המשחית. It is charac teristic of prophetic irony to take shibboleths of a group and to twist their meaning slightly or to make a paronomastic use of the terms so as to refute the persons concerned. It is possible that this is the use of הר־המשחיתהר־המשחית here. This is especially likely since the term משחית appears in a similar use in the first verse of this chapter. Verse 25 concludes with the threat that Yahweh will make Babylon הר שרפה. If there is a play a The occurrences are (exclusive of המשחית) as follows: משחית in Gen. 19.14; Isa. 54.16; Jer. 2.30; 5.26; 51.1; Ezek. 21.36; Prov. 6.32; 18.9; 28.24; I Chron. 21.12; המשחית in Ezek. 9.8; ומשחית in Jer. 4.7: למשחית in Ex. 12.13; Ezek. 5.16; 9.6; 25.15; Dan. 10.8; II Chron. 20.23; 22•4I משחיתם in Gen. 6.13; a plural form of משחית in Gen. 19.13; Judg. 20.42; I Sam. 6.5; II Sam. 20.15; Isa• 1-4: Jer. 6.28; 22.7; II Chron. 27.2.</page><page sequence="6">142 JOHN BRIGGS CURTIS [6] upon הר המשחית, it is possible that the term הר שרפה is also involved and might have been applied in a positive sense to Babylon, but was given a negative twist by the prophet. Another occurrence of the term המשחית is in the instructions about preparations for the plague of death in Egypt. On this occasion Moses states that, if the people will fulfill the prescriptions set forth, Yahweh will not let המשחית come to their houses to plague them (Ex. 12.23). The personage here involved is clearly a messenger or angel of death, conceived of as subservient to Yahweh. Yet another story of a plague uses the term המשחית, though in a different manner. The narrative of David's being faced with the deci sion as to which plague he would prefer to have sent to Israel involves a personality called המלאך המשחית בעם רב (II Sam. 24.16). Clearly המשחית is a descriptive term here rather than an appellative and thé same is true of the parallel passage in I Chron. 21.15, but the choice of the term and its application to the מלאך יהוה is indeed interesting. As far as this story is concerned, the מלאך יהוה is an agent of death, a bringer of plagues, and a destroyer, who annihilates people with the permission of Yahweh. The other two occurrences of המשחית (I Sam. 13.17; 14-15) are technical uses meaning "a band of raiders" and thus do not apply here. Two uses of משחית (without the article) should be noted. Prov. 18.9 says: גם מתרפה במלאכתו אח הוא לבעל משחית. At face value the verse says that the man slack in his work is a brother to "Lord Destroyer," though it is possible that בעל משחית may mean "the man who de stroys." In Isa. 54.16 one of the claims of Yahweh is ואנכי בראתי משחית לחבל. Admittedly משחית may be a general term here for "destroyer" with specific reference to Babylon, but it is also possible that משחית may be a spirit or personality manifested in every form of destruction. In conclusion, it seems likely that the OT knows a superhuman personality who plagues and destroys. This being also appears to have borne some special relationship to the Mount of Olives and to Babylon. IV. K6môs and Molek In order to obtain some insight into the connection between this mythological "Destroyer" and the Mount of Olives, it is necessary to raise the question as to the deities known to have been worshipped there. As noted above, I Kings 11.7 records that Solomon erected a sanctuary on the mountain to Kemôs and Molek- The text reads</page><page sequence="7">[7] THE MOUNT OF OLIVES IN TRADITION 143 אז יבנה שלמה במה לכמוש שקץ מואב בהר אשר על־פני ירושלם ולמלך שקץ בני עמון. The singular במה does not allow us to insist that only one sanctuary was built for the two gods, but it is possible that a single holy place is meant. At any rate, in the mind of the author, the two deities were closely connected, for he mentions them together, and certainly each had his place of worship on the same height. Kemôs7 is normally considered a god peculiar to Moab (I Kings 11•733 '! II Kings 23.13; Jer. 48.7). Moab is indeed called "the people of Kemô§" (Jer. 48.46; Num. 21.29, almost identical passages). This means that Kemôs and Moab stood in a special relation to each other. Moab worshipped Kemôs and fulfilled the rites of his religion; Kemôs then took special care of Moab by protecting them from enemies, both spiritual and temporal. In the speech of Jephthah to the Am monites, we have an interesting exception to the general practice of considering Ktmôs as the patron god of Moab. Here Jephthah refers to Kemôs as "your god." Actually it would set the record straight if we would insist that the reading כמוש is here an error for מלך or 8.מלכם We would then assume that the writer of the passage, who was more closely acquainted with his neighbors and their gods than we can ever be, completely erred. Or we would have to say that the error entered through transmission of the text, but מלכם or מלך does not sound nor look enough like כמוש to explain the error as accidental. Nor is there any conceivable reason to say that a scribe deliberately altered a read ing of מלך or מלכם to כמוש. Thus we would best consider the text accurate and say that Kemô§ must have been a god of both the Moabites and the Ammonites. The god of the Ammonites is normally called מלכם (I Kings 11.5, 33; II Kings 23.13) and perhaps מלכם (Jer. 49.1, 3; Zeph. 1.5), though 7 For discussions of previous proposals about the meaning and nature of K'môs see "Kemosch," Baudissin, Realencyclopàdie fiir protestantische Theologie und Kirche, ed. J. J. Herzog and A. Haupt, vol. 10, pp. 243-246; "Chemosh," G. F. Moore, Encyclopaedia Encyclopaedia Biblica, vol. I, cc. 736-738; and Baethgen, Beitrdge zur Semitischen Religionsgeschichte,Religionsgeschichte, pp. 13-15. Baethgen, makes a great deal of the well-known gem belonging to במשיחי and picturing apparently a flaming winged sun. From this he concludes that K&gt;mos is a sun god. This conclusion is totally unwarranted for the inscription is לכמשיחי "belonging to במשיחי" (see de Vogue, Mélanges d'arch. orient., p. 89; Levy, Siegel und Gemmen, tab. Ill 10). Though this man seems to have been named for Kemôs, there is no reason to think that the figure of the gem is a represen tation of Kemos. Baethgen does correctly conclude that Kemôs and Môlek are equivalent, but without adequate evidence. 8 G. F. Moore, Judges (ICC), p. 295, cites the different opinions that have been given of this reading; he then concludes that the whole speech, without regard to the context, was composed with reference to Moab not Ammon.</page><page sequence="8">144 JOHN BRIGGS CURTIS [8] the latter spelling may be an error in pointing or may not refer to a deity at all. As already noted this divine personage is called מלך in II Kings 11.7.9 Unfortunately none of these passages tells us anything about the god מלך. We do know, however, that in the valley of the son (or "sons" with Ketîb II Kings 23.10) of Hinnom a rite was practiced which was called להעביר את־בניהם ואת־בנותיהם למלך (Jer. 32-35: II Kings 23.10; Lev. 18.21). This terminology most easily refers to the actual sacrificing of children as burnt offerings to the god,10 though Jensen11 suggests that this is merely a symbolic act, a substitute for the sacrifice no longer practiced. The Holiness Code (Lev. 20.1-5) considers the giving (נתן) of children to Môlek as a most abominable act, which is worthy of death. From this passage we recognize that the worship of Môlek survived the strenuous measures of the reform of Josiah and was present in ,the exilic or post-exilic period. A passage most strikingly suggesting the identity of the two deities dealt with does not use the name of either but certainly deals with Kemô§. We are told in II Kings 3.27, that the king of Moab, hard pressed in battle, offered his eldest son, the heir to the throne, as a burnt sacrifice. Because of this a great wrath was kindled against Israel, so that in the ensuing battle the Israelites were defeated and compelled to withdraw. Clearly the sacrifice thus made was offered to the god of Moab, K°mô§. But this practice is itself strikingly similar to the offering of children to Môlek- We again have considerable reason to wonder if Kemô§ and Môlek are not indeed the same deity. One of the most illuminating pictures of the god Kemô§ is to be found in the famous Moabite Stone or Mesa' Inscription. Mesa', the king of Moab, tells that Omri, the king of Israel, had oppressed Moab because Kemôs was angry with his land (11. 4-6). Omri's son had ' The traditional pointing is used here though it is usually explained that the name סלך has been pointed with the vowels of כשת. 10 There is a well-known and oft-quoted description of the idol of Moloch, according to which the idol was anthropomorphic with outstretched arms holding its palms horizontal and open upward. These palms were said to have been heated and on them the child was laid l&lt;y the priest to be roasted to death, while loud music was played to drown the screams of the victim and the parents looked on without emotion. G. F. Moore in "The Images of Moloch," JBL XVI (1897), pp. 161-165, has shown in considerable detail that this description is not genuine but is borrowed from reports of Greek historians about worship of Kronos among the Carthaginians. The fact that this account is not genuine, however, should not be considered as evidence that there was no sacrifice of children to Molek. " P. Jensen, "Die Gotter כמוש und מלך und die Erscheinungsformen Kammul und Malik des assyrisch-babylonischen Gottes Nergal," Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie 42, 1934, p. 236.</page><page sequence="9">[9] THE MOUNT OF OLIVES IN TRADITION 145 sought to continue the oppression but Mesa' had defeated Israel (1. 7). He attacked the Israelite garrison at 'Atârôt and put to death the entire town as a spectacle (רית) to Kemô§ and Moab (1. 12). Kemô§ is quoted as having said "Go, take Nebo against Israel." This he did, making חרם the people of Nebo to 14-17 .11) עשתר־כמוש). The sanctuaries of Yahweh were destroyed there (11. 17 f.). Then Kemô§ drove Israel out of Jahaz (11. 18 f.). Later Kcmô§ commanded, "Go down, fight against Horonaim" (1. 32). — The implications of this text remind one of OT theology. Even as the pre-exilic prophets insisted that the lands of Israel and Judah suffered because Yahweh was angry with them, so Me§a' feels that Moab can suffer only because Kemô§ is angry. How his anger was appeased we are not told unless the slaughter at 'Atârôt was considered propitiation. At any rate, the Moabite king feels that all his campaigns against Israel and his destruction of the altars of foreign gods are at the specific behest of his god. Indeed it is Kemô§ who wins the victories for him. At Nebo we hear of the violent massacre called חרם according to which every living creature is slaughtered as an act of devotion to the deity. Interestingly the holy massacre is for the benefit of עשתר־כמוש rather than simply כמוש. The former deity is undoubtedly the consort of Kemô§, the "A§tar of Kemô§." It is clear from the Myth of Nergal and EreSkigal" that the original Assyro Babylonian deity of the underworld is a female, EreSkigal; the male deity only later became associated with her. The original idea in the ancient Near East seems to have been that the earthly sphere, and with it the underworld, is female, the heavenly sphere being male. Subsequently, however, female deities were associated with the gods of heaven and males with goddesses of earth. Thus when we have in the Moabite Stone the sacred sacrifice חרם to the consort of Kemô§, rather than to Kemô§ himself, we find a reflection of ancient concepts of underworld deities. Thus, with the exception of the consort, our only Moabite source pictures Kemô§, as a national god, in much the same way as the Bible, conceives of Yahweh as the national god of Israel. One further feature of the Moabite Stone may indicate the identity of Kcmo§ and Môlek• The first line of the text suffered severely in the breaking up of the stone so that it is not completely legible. The text (in part) reads אנך משע * בן כמש [מלך] * מלך מאב 12 J. A. Knudtzon, Die El-Amarna Tafeln, pp. 969 ff. — This myth tells how Nergal, a god of the heavenly sphere, fell from his lofty estate to become the consort of Ereslcigal, the goddess of the underworld.</page><page sequence="10">146 JOHN BRIGGS CURTIS [10] The bracketed damaged signs here represent the real problem.13 Smend and Socin read מלך without equivocation, but later Socin and Holzinger expressed doubt about the ל• Lidzbarski in 1898 (Nord semitischen Epigraphik, Weimar, 1898) read 1־־1לך with doubt as to a first consonant, but later, (Ephemeris fur semitische Epig., Giessen, 1902) decided to read כן, in which he was followed by Driver. Ginzberg read נד, and Levy read the same with doubt about the נ. Clermont Ganneau suggested גד or שלך or שלם, and even נדב on the basis of the name in Sennacherib's account of his third campaign. Kaempf aban dons all attempts to read the text and proposes to read עשתר from 1. 17, with the application of the name to the deity, not to Me§a"s father. Noldeke, Compston, and Vriezen-Hospers avoid the problem by leaving a blank. In view of such vacillation, no certainty is obtainable; but most scholars read with reluctance at least in part מלך so that the name may have been כמש־מלך. This name can mean either "Kemf&gt;§ is king" or "Kem6§ is Molek." If the latter is correct, then we have another indication of the equation of K؟m6s with Molek. Jensen14 in his brief, but highly suggestive article has shown reason to believe that Mslek (Milkom) and Kem6§ are nothing more than specialized local forms of the Assyro-Babylonian god of death and the underworld, Nergal. His reasons for this conclusion are briefly: (1) The name of the place of sacrifice to Molek becomes in Greek and Arabic the name for hell; i. e. ןיא קנם = Ytevva = 2). ־؛دهنم) The god Nergal is called apparently "the pure (or holy) stove," which suggests that he was a god especially manifested in the fire of the underworld. It is possible that the "stove" is of the type used for whole-burnt sacrifices. (3) To a female associate of Nergal's human sacrifice was required under certain conditions. (4) In a certain list of gods ثمسأسه is equated with Nergal, and in another Malik is likewise equated with Nergal. (5) The Qur'fin 43:77 knows of ماللأ who is the ruling spirit in hell. — The reasons set forth by Jensen are striking in that they support what has already been shown — that there is considerable reason to believe that Kembs and Molek are the same deity. It is worthwhile that Jensen's evidence should be examined here. 13 The textual considerations here are based on the critical apparatus in Bennett, The The Moabite Stone, plus an examination of Compston, The Inscription on the Stele of Mêla' \Mêla' \Mêla' \ Levy, Das Mesa-Denkmal und seine Schrift; Vriezen and Hospers, Palestine Inscriptions',Inscriptions', Kaempf, Das Rùhmen Moab's; Nôldeke, Die Inschrift des K'ônigs Mesa von von Moab. 1י Jensen, loc. cit., pp. 235-237.</page><page sequence="11">[1لل THE MOUNT OF OLIVES IN TRADITION 147 The valley where the idolatrous sacrifice occurred (II Kings 23.10; II Chron. 28.3; 33-6; Jer- 7-31 ة؛ (35-32 ;6 -2-19 ؛•؛ usually called 3י[א؛־בןהנם, but Josh. 15.8 and 18.16 both use גי בן הנם and גי הנם as equivalent terms for a locality at Jerusalem. The shorter name of this place of sacrifice abominable to an orthodox worshipper of Yahweh became the name for hell among the Jews, the Christians, and the Arabs. It is most significant that the Qur'an names the god of hell (ْاوائ (جهنم, as follows: ان المجرين ى عداب جهنم خالدون ٠ لا ضر م وهمم نه مبلسون ٠ وما ظلمنا هم ولكن كانوا هم ا لظالمين ٠ ونادوا يا مالك ليقص عليظ ريك قال انكم ماكثون ٠ ة771 43:74 Sura Behold, the guilty are remaining forever in the pains of hell. It shall not become lessened for them, and they shall be stupefied in it. We have not wronged them, but they have done wrong; and they cry "0 Malik, let your master make an end of us." He said, "Behold you shall remain." Here we get a picture of the eternal suffering of the guilty in hell. They will cry out to Malik that he allow (or urge) his master (i. e. Allah) to annihilate them (so that their sufferings will cease). But Malik answers that they must continue (in their suffering). Clearly Malik is the god reigning over the dead in a place called جتهتت_م. This Malik is certainly nothing but the מלך worshipped in גי בן הנם. How ever, Malik is never equated with Saitan in Islam. The NT is so involved with Satan or the Devil as a spirit of evil and sin that only on the rarest occasion do we get a view of him as a god of death. But two passages seem to reflect in him the ancient picture of the god of death. In Hebrews 2.14 f. the writer says of Jesus: Έ7γ€1 ούν τα παιδία κεκοινώνηκεν αίματος και σαρκός, και αυτός αυτός παρα πλησίως μετ έσχεν τών αυτών, ΐνα δια του θανάτου καταργήστ!καταργήστ! τον τό κράτος 'έχοντα του θανάτου, τοϋτ' έστιν τον διάβολον,διάβολον, και άπαλλάζη τούτους, όσοι φόβοι θανάτου δια παντός τοΰ ζην ένοχοι ησαν δουλεία ς.16 '5 Corani Textus Arabicus, Gustavus Fluegel, p. 263. 16 Novum Testamentum Graece, ed. Eberhard Nestle, 20th edition, p. 551.</page><page sequence="12">148 JOHN BRIGGS CURTIS [12] Here the devil is pictured as "him who has the power of death." The work of Jesus is considered as a bout between himself and the god of death, so that, by a ruse, the power of the death-god was broken and thus men were freed from his control. In Jude 9 a very strange incident is described as follows: '0 δε Μιχαήλ 0 apxayyeXos, ότε τώ διαβάλω διακρινάμε vosvos bitKtytTO περί τοϋ Μωϋσάοί σώματος, ουκ ετόλμησεν κρίσιν κρίσιν eneveyKelv βλασφημίας, άλλα εΐπεν έπιτιμήσαι σοι κύριος.11 κύριος.11 Here seems to be a reference to a non-extant work about the assump tion of Moses. The important element for us is that the devil is pic tured as feeling that he has a rightful claim to the corpse of Moses, but his claim is disputed by a heavenly power. Clearly again here the devil has something of the role of Malik in Islam — that of god of the dead. Yet another passage knows of a realm of the dead without mention of the god of the dead: 'ότι'ότι και Χριστός άπαξ irepi αμαρτιών άπέθανεν, δίκαιος υπέρ άδικων,άδικων, 'ίνα υμάς προσαγάγω τώ θεώ, θανατωθείς μεν σαρκί ζωοποιηθείςζωοποιηθείς δε πνεύματι' εν ώ και τοις εν φυλακή ττνεύμασιν πορευθείς πορευθείς εκήρυξεν, άπειθήσασίν ποτε ότε άπεξεδεχετο ή τοϋ θεοϋθεοϋ μακροθυμία έν ημέραις Νώ6 κατασκευαζόμενης κιβωτού, εις εις ην ολίγοι, τουτ' εστίν οκτώ φυχαί, διεσώθησαν δι' ύδατος18 (I Peter 3.18-20). Those who were formerly disobedient are considered as being impris oned in some realm where Christ could reach them only after he was put to death.19 Thus the mission of Christ is again connected with the ancient motif of the realm of the dead. It is worthy of note that the dead are called τοις έν φυλακή πνεύμασιν; if imprisoned, we wonder who is to be thought of as the keeper of the prison. Since we are not told, it is probably safe to assume that again the devil is considered as guard over the dead much like Malik in the Sura cited above. In view of the Qur'an and the NT, there is no reason to doubt that the Molek worshipped in the Hinnon Valley survived as the god of the dead who had power in Gehenna. *ז Ibid., p. 611. 18 Ibid., pp. 588 f.

We do not know the exact nature of the stove with which it was appropriate to associate Nergal. Jensen22 hazards an admittedly doubtful guess that it might be the kind of device used for whole-burnt sacrifice. In any case, we see that the Babylonian underworld and death god is particularly associated with fire — a role that seems fitting for Kemô§ and Môlek, who received burnt human sacrifice. Johns23 published two contracts that make a striking provision in case either party defaulted. We quote the pertinent lines according to the transliteration of Kohler and Ungnad: "aplu-§u a-na iluSin iSarrap mârat-su rabî-te itti pa.nu erini a-na Be-lit-iluseri i-§ar-rap"24 "His son he shall burn to Sin, his oldest daughter with 20 ka(?) of cedar he shall burn to Belit-seri," and "mârat-su rabî-tû itti 20 ka erini a-na Be-lit-iluseri i-sar-rap"2s "His oldest daughter he shall burn to Belit-seri with 20 ka of cedar." Both deities mentioned here may be considered underworld gods, Belit-seri being the scribe of the under world26 while Sin passed three days each month in the underworld. This penalty clause providing for the burning of the eldest daughter of the party violating the contract reminds us of the Mesa' Inscription quoted above, p. 145, according to which Kcmôs's consort was to receive human sacrifice. Two god-lists make certain what has already been suggested by other data. A partially damaged but completely legible list has in parallel columns of gods one line which reads: "dMa-lik dNergal."27 In yet another list we find the ideogram for Nergal first in a long list of gods with whom he is equated; among these deities occurs "dKa am-mu§."28 Thus cuneiform texts confirm the equation of Nergal with both Môlek and Kemô§. 30 K.

Eusebius makes the following comment: Άρινά, η /cat Άριήλ. 'Ακύλας, Σύμμαχος λβόντα. ταύτην ταύτην elvaiβϊναί φασι την Άρβόπολιν, βπβιδή καλονσιν βίς βτι καΐ νϋν ΆριήλΆριήλ το β'ίδωλον αυτών 01 την Άρβόπολι,ν οίκοϋντβς, άπό τοϋτοϋ σβββιν τον "Αρβα, έξ ού και την πόλιν ώνόμασιν.29 Eusebius obviously thought of either Rabbath-moab or Ar-moab, both of which were called Άρβόπολις in the Roman period. In his opinion that city and its idol received their names from the fact that Ares, or Mars, was worshipped there. Jerome30 in his commentary on this passage disagrees with Eusebius and interprets with Aquila and Symmachus, applying the name Άριήλ to Jerusalem only. The most valid criticism of Eusebius is to point out that Άρβόπολις may be a corruption of the Semitic הר. However, some weight seems to be given to Eusebius' idea by the occurrence of coins of the time of Getaand Severus which picture a standing warrior in the type of Mars.31 One might object to the interpretation of this figure as Mars that, at this late period, a god represented on a coin would probably be the Nabatean Dusares rather than the old Moabite Kem6§.32 This argu ment is not decisive, however, for certain Semitic gods habitually absorb the name and character of the previous god of the locale, e. g. Yahweh absorbs Έ1 'Elybn so that the former is called by the name of the latter and the god of Israel is worshipped at the sanctuary of his predecessor — indeed even the stories about Έ1 Έΐνόη are said to concern Yahweh. In the same way Dusares may have inherited much of his personality from Kem6§. Thus it is possible that even at this late period Kemo§ was remembered to be a god of war, who could be identified with the Greek Ares. One of the functions of Nergal was that of god of war, for a god of death and the underworld secondarily becomes the god of everything that produces death and thus swells his realm. XXIV, Plate 36 (K. 4349), rev. 11. 51, 66. — If the -mm- seems strange when compared with ימוש!, we see that this seems to have been normal in cuneiform, for we find in Sennacherib's third campaign mention of a Moabite king mKam-mu־ su-na-ad-bi (c. II, 1. 53). Thus the eastern Semites must have heard a double -mm preceded by an "a" vowel. 2' Eusebii Pamphilii Episcopi Caesariensis Onomasticon Urbium et Locorum SacraeSacrae Scripturae, ed. F.

Some Ffatures of the Personality of Nergal To apply to the Judaeo-Christian tradition the principle that KemôS and Môlek are only specialized local expressions of Nergal, it is neces sary now to examine some aspects of the personality of this god. Nergal's character was by no means simple, for he seems to have had two different phases of personality, one benevolent, the other malignant. He was, on the one hand, the god of death and of the realm of the dead; war, violence, flood, plague, and famine are his special concern. On the other hand, he emerges as the god of life who protects his worshippers, by whom evil spirits are exorcised, and who gives life, especially to vegetation. Bollenriicher has aptly called this phenomenon Nergal's Januscharakter.33 An especially illuminating picture of Nergal may be gleaned from the several hymns and prayers to him that have come down to us. The first of the texts collected by Bollenriicher is one which shows the benevolence of the deity. After an opening invocation which praises the deity, the worshipper lays open his heart and begs for help from the gracious divine personage. The author of this psalm seeks the favor of the fearful deity by attributing to him great wisdom : Neben Ea im Gôtterkreise ist dein Rat hochangesehen ; mit Sin am Himmel durchschaust du ailes.34 A god who has insight comparable to that of the highest gods can also be praised for his graciousness: Weil du giitig bist, o Herr, wende ich mich an deine Gottheit; weil du voll Erbarmen bist, suche ich dich auf. Weil du gnâdig blickst, schaue ich auf dein Angesicht; weil du voll Vergebung bist, stehe ich vo[r dir].35 In the belief that these words of praise would win him the deity's favor, the worshipper then prays for forgiveness. גג Josef Bollenriicher, Gebete und Hymnen an Nergal, p. 9. «34 Ibid., p. 15.

The same idea is expressed in an invocation against Evil Spirits found in the Series Utukkî limnûti. The sorcerer in this case, in seeking to exorcise a malignant spirit, profited of an auspicious constellation of the heavenly bodies to invoke these deities supposedly capable of casting forth the evil demon; his face turned toward the setting sun, he begins as follows: SamaSSamaS is before me, Sin is behind [me], Nergal is at [my] right hand, Ninurta is at my left hand.36 The mention of Nergal, the planet Mars,37 has a meaning here only if he is conceived of as using his might over the demons to break their power. ג، R. c. Thompson, The ما1ءء and Evil Spirits ٠/ Babylonia, vol. I, pp. 14 ff., Utukki limnflti, tab. II, 11. 142 ff., transliterated and translated this text from CT 16 and 17. These lines read: dSamas ina pa-ni-؛a dSin ina ar-[ki-j؛a] dNergal ina im-ni-[ja] dNinurta ina su-me-l؛-ja. 7ت Jensen (Kosmologie, pp. 135 f.) cited considerable evidence to show that Nergal was equated with the planet Mars: First, the planet has the name (dingir) Gud-(ud) (II R 49; No. 3, 44), while Nergal is designated as (dingir) Gudgud (II R 54, No. 5, 71 Obv). Second, Bibbu (i. e. Mars) is called (dingir) Ningir banda (V R 21, 27cd), which in V R 21, 25cd is equated with Almu, a special ized local form of Nergal. A confirmation of Mars as the star of Nergal is found in the Mandaean נירניל (see Noldeke) and ניריג for the planet Mars. Further, Al blrfini IChronologie oriental. Volker, ed. Sachau, p. 192) cites ثرءال as the Syriac name of Mars. Thus it can be granted that Nergal was considered as the deity manifested in the red planet. The planetary character of Nergal is suggested also by a lapis lazuli cylinder seal (WAG. 42.189) described by c. H. Gordon ("Western Asiatic Seals in the Walters Art Gallery," Iraq, vol. VI, p. 9), as follows: A bearded god wearing a flat cap sits on a covered chair. His long robe with bordered top and bottom opens down the front and is suspended from the left shoulder, leaving the right shoulder bare and free. He salutes a bearded, flat-capped worshipper, who returns the salute and wears a robe much like the god's. A flounced-robed goddess, whose divinity is indicated by a many horned crown, raises her hands in intercession and blessing. From the mural paintings of Mari [See Syria, XVIII, 1937, pi. XXXIX (opposite p. 336)] we now know that the flounced robe was many-coloured. Before the god is an eight-pointed star within a crescent. Also we learn from Gordon that the seal bears the inscription: Inzu-zu dup-sar (2) dumu A-ag-ga-na (3) er dNe-iri-gal. "Inzuzu, the scribe, son of Aggan(a), servant of Nergal." Since the owner of this seal proclaimed himself as the servant or worshipper of Nergal, it seems safe to assume that the deities represented are Nergal and a consort, probably Ereskigal. The planetary symbol on this seal is a further association of Nergal with the celestial sphere.</page><page sequence="17">[17] THE MOUNT OF OLIVES IN TRADITION 153 A clay cone of Warad-Sin contains a prayer as follows: In my work may Nergal, my god, take delight; a destiny of life, a long reign, a throne of firm foundation, may he give.38 Here is an invocation of Nergal as a gracious and benevolent deity, who is considered able to grant blessings of long life and prosperous, unchallenged reign. Even as late as the period of the papyri of the Jews of Elephantine we find Nergal's blessing being invoked by a worshipper: אל אחי חגי אחוך ירחו שלם אחי בל וגבו שמש ונרגל39 To Uaggai my brother [from] your brother Yarho.

LAM.TA.È.A "the god who goes forth from É. MES .LAM," a term applied to him by Sulgi of the Third Dynasty of Ur [Barton, op. cit., pp. 276-279 (CT, IX, no. 35389; Lenormant, Choix de texts cuneiform inédites no. 61)] and Gudea (Barton, op. cit., pp. 254-255; Amiand, in de Sarzec, Découvertes en ChaldeeChaldee p.

This little text indicates the persistence of the worship of this deity even though his devotee is quite distant from the best known centers of his worship. Another feature of the gracious Nergal is found in the fragmentary psalm K. 11153 which Bôllenrùcher transliterates and translates as his text Nr. 2. The first two partially legible lines read: [ ]-Û ilu ri-mi-nu-u [ ] mu-bal-lit mmîtu41 .... gracious god, .... who causes the dead to live. These words picture the god as compassionate and as "one who causes the dead to live." A similar idea is found in K. 8310, line 3: sa nap-har bul-lu-tu [it-ti-ka (?)] [Du, bei (?)] dem jede Belebung.42 To these Bôllenrùcher compares the personal name Nergal-uballit (Bezold, Cat. V 2138).43 Of especial interest is the term mu-bal-litmu-bal-lit mmîtummîtu "he who can cause the dead to live." This may mean literally that Nergal is one who raises the dead, but resurrection is an idea almost totally lacking in the Assyro-Babylonian literature. Rather to this must be compared OT passages like Ps. 30.4 Qerê: יהוה העלית מן־שאול נפשי חייתני מירדי־בור Even as the psalmist claims Yahweh brought him up from the realm of the dead, so Nergal can be said to have the power to restore to life. The worshipper had come to the very brink of death, but at the moment of despairing his deity saved his life or gave him a new lease on life. The devout man must attribute his salvation from death to his god.44 Ebeling translates a Sumerian prayer to Nergal, who is Samaria and were worshipping Nergal there. But Nergal was not confined to Kutû. Ashurbanipal repaired a shrine for this deity at Tarbisu {ibid., p. 84). This sanctuary was also renovated by Sennacherib (Rawlinson I 7c). A certain Arisen, king of Urkis and Nawar characterizes Nergal as the divine king of the town of Ha-wi-lim (Thureau-Dangin, RA, IX, pl. I; Barton, op. cit., pp. 170-171). Thus the worship of Nergal which originally was centered at Kutû spread to other holy places. 41 Bôllenrucher, op. cit., p. 17. 44 Ibid., p. 20. « Ibid., p. 19. 44 A. Heidel, The Gilgamesh Epic and Old Testament Parallels, pp. 208-210, deals with the term muballif mîti at length. It is appropriate to sketch his suggestions here: The term is one applied to a number of gods like Marduk, Nabu, Ninurta,</page><page sequence="19">[19] THE MOUNT OF OLIVES IN TRADITION 155 praised among other things as he who "allows the land to become green" and who "increases the green." This same prayer rays that "he renews the blood, causes death (and) life."45 Thus again we find him as the god of life. Among the many appellatives which Tallqvist finds applied to Nergal, four are noteworthy in this connection: Lugal-giS-a-tu-gab-Ii§ "king of the mulberry tree" (KAV 63, III 17); Lugal-gi§-gi§immar "king of the date palm" (KAV 63, III 19); Lugal gis-Sinig "king of the tamarisk" (KAV 63, III 16); Sar-bu-u "lord of the mulberry tree" (CT 25:35, Rs. 26; 37, 16).46 Since plants emerged from the earth, the lower regions of which were the abode of Nergal, it was only logical that he should be considered the god of vegetation. Thus from the evidence cited above it is clear that Nergal was Shamash, et al. (Tallqvist, Akkadische Gôtterepitheta, pp. 67 f.). [It was especially appropriate to apply the term to Gula, the healer of the sick.] That the Mesopotamian people could call the brink of death by the term "death" is seen from many texts. In Enuma elish, Tablet VI, 153 f., Marduk is called the one "who restored all the ruined gods, as though they were his own creation; the lord who by his holy incanta tion restored the dead gods to life" (uballifu ilâni mîtûti). Clearly the gods had not actually died but had come to the brink of destruction. In the same epic (VII, 26), Marduk is called "the lord of the holy incantation, who restores the dead to life" (muballit(muballit mîti) — the "dead" here being the vanquished gods who had been allied with Tiâmat but whose lives were spared. In the Sargonid letters two selections give a similar usage: "After the city Birat was devastated and its gods were carried off, I was a dead man (mîtu anâku). But when I saw the golden seal of the king, my lord, I was restored to life (abtalu{). But now, when I send my messenger (to inquire) concerning the welfare of the king, my lord, I did not see the seal of the king, my lord, and so was not restored to life (ul ablut) ; I am a dead man (mîtu anâku). Let the king, my lord, not forsake me!" (Harper, Assyrian and Babylonian Letters, No. 259, rev. I-10). "With the many deeds of kindness, which from the beginning the king, my lord, has shown (me) and manifested (toward me), who was but a dead dog, the son of a nobody, the king, my lord, has restored me to life (uballifanni)" (Harper, op. cit., No. 521:4-7). Returning to the idea referred to deities, he finds it said of Ninurta: "The body of him who was brought down to the underworld (ana arallê) thou dost restore (tutarra)" (King, Babylonian Magic and Sorcery, No. 2:22). Cyrus calls himself "the lord who by his power has restored the dead to life (sha . . . uballitu mîtûtân)"mîtûtân)" (Rawlinson, The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia, vol. V, PI. 35: 19). By this he means that he freed the Babylonians from the rule of Nabonidus. Similarly the Hittite king Shuppiluliumash can say: "The dead (mîta) land Mitanni I cause to live (uballazu) (and) restore it to its former estate" [H. H. Figulla, E. Forrer, E. E. Weidner, Keilschrifttexte aus Boghazkoi, vol. I (Leipzig, 1923), No. I, rev. 22]. Thus Heidel has demonstrated from the literature that muballit mîti mîti refers to deliverance from dire circumstances and not to resurrection from the dead. « Erich Ebeling, Tod und Leben, part I, pp. 165-170.

The reason for such a concept is to be found in the dark side of Nergal's personality, to which we must now direct our attention. A god of death and of the under world can be considered one who preserves life; for, if he is appeased, he will refrain from taking life. The worshipper reveres the god of death and evil, believing that by so doing he will deter the deity from causing his death and from bringing calamity to him. To understand Nergal properly we turn now to the more characteristic concepts about him. The benevolent side of Nergal is at best only a small portion of his being. Basically he is a god of death, violence, war, pestilence, and flood; he is a hero among the gods, a mighty warrior, a raging demon, a sword. He is a pitiless being who destroys and crushes and over throws. All these characteristics are seen in the psalms to him. A brief fragmentary psalm translated by Bollenrucher is instructive for it contains characteristic epithets of Nergal: Warrior! Raging storm-tide, who flattens out the lands in upheaval, Warrior! Lord of the underworld, One who goes forth from Mes-lam, Great bull, Lord of strength, Lord of Kutha, Lord of É-mes-lam One who oversees Hendur-sag-ga, Warrior! Subula Raging storm-tide, who has no rival Who wields the weapon, who raises the troops.47 Here he is seen in his more usual relationship, as a violent god who kills and destroys. The other hymns collected by Bollenrucher present 47 One copy of this text (K. 5137) was published in IV R 26, 1, and was treated by Bollenriicher, op. cit., pp. 21-23.

Nergal is the "oppressor of the hostile,"48 "raging fire god"49 "the bursting of a dam which destroys the produce of the fields,"50 "a lion, clothed with terror"51 "pitiless,"54 "strong bull."53 These appellatives could be multiplied, but their general import is obvious. Almost any term that denotes strength and violence might be applied to Nergal. A few characteristic descrip tions will be noted here. Especially terrifying is the picture of Nergal as the god of the flood-producing storm. Nergal's rising up is a storm or a hurricane which puts down the mountain and the land.54 He is compared to a raging storm-tide and a dam bursting because of the flood waters and destroying all the crops.55 His word may be described similarly. It is a storm let loose which has no appointed rival. It stills the heavens; it strikes the earth. As though they were a bum reed, it wipes out a mother with her child.

Little need be said of Nergal as god of the underworld. The variety of terms for the nether regions is considerable but these may be noted from Tallqvist's compilation: Lugal-hus-ki-a "king of the dreadful land," Lugal-hu-bur "king of the tjubur River," Lugal-hu§-uru "king of the fearful city," Lugal-ke§-da "king of the underworld," Umun urugal-la "lord of the great city." One of the two regular forms of the name Nergal Nè-iri (unu)-gal means "the might of the great city," apparently referring to the lower world.57 Nergal is also invoked as a god of war. He is the great sword-god,58 who is the commander of battle.5' It is his authority which brings either victory or defeat.60 Nergal raises the weapon and impels to combat.61 Many kings believed that victory was given to them by the god Nergal. For example, Sulmânu-aSarid III considered that his kingdom was given to him by a great array of gods among whom he mentions Nergal git-ma-lu sar tam-ha-ri.62 Pritchard prints translations of several texts in which a king gives the credit for his victory to Nergal. In defeating the Aramean coalition Sulmânu-aSarid III says I fought with them with (the support of) the mighty forces of Ashur, which Ashur, my lord, has given to me, and the strong weapons which Nergal, my leader, has presented to me, (and) I did in flict a defeat upon them between the towns Karkara and Gilzau.63 Similar expressions of belief that Nergal has given victory are made by Naram-Sîn,64 Esarhaddon,65 and Ashurbanipal.66 Thus clearly Nergal is to be regarded as a god of war in addition to his other functions. One other feature is worthy of note from the prayer and hymn material — Nergal as the god of disease and pestilence. His word makes the people — yea, even the whole land — sick; it weakens and ravages the land.67 A picture of Nergal of great significance is the following " Tallqvist, op. cit., pp. 389-391. 58 Bôllenrucher, op. cit., pp. 26.

The deity is the uninvited guest who enters in spite of all preparation against him. He comes bearing a sword to slay whom he will. There are some similarities between this idea and that of the plague of death in Egypt (Ex. 12.29 ff•)■ In chapter III above, it was noted that the agent of death was called המשחית (Ex. 12.23) and that the Mount of Olives was designated הר־המשחית (II Kings 23.13). Without insisting, we should regard it as possible that המשחית of the OT is Nergal in his function as plague-god and destroyer. Especially interesting from our point of view are the royal curses in the name of Nergal. Among the curses at the end of the Code of Hammurapi is one which invokes Nergal. A future king who does not heed the words of the code or who effaces the name of Hammurapi and replaces it with his own is cursed as follows: May Nergal, mighty amongst the gods, the warrior whom none can resist, who has fulfilled my eager desire, by his great power consume his people like a fire raging amongst the rushes, may he cleave him asunder with his mighty weapon and shatter his limbs as of a statue of clay.6' 68 Ibid., p. 26 (K. 4809, lines 40 ff.). 6י CH XXVIII r, 24-39; latest transliteration: Driver and Miles, The Babylonian Laws,Laws, II, pp. 104 I.

It is noteworthy that the pun ishment invoked for the transgressor's people is compared to the con suming fire among the dry woods ; this reminds us of the connections of Nergal with fire as seen in the epithet É-gir4-kù, mentioned in the preceding chapter. Whoever should efface an inscription of Sam§i-Adad I was to be punished by several gods among whom was Nergal: (9) dNergal (10) i-na ka-â§-ka-3i-im (11) i-§i-it-ta-Su (12) ù i-§i-it-ti ma-ti-§û (13) li-ir-ta-ad-di70 May Nergal with strength carry away his treasure and the treasure of his land. The deity is here invoked to carry away the treasure of such an in soient person along with that of his country. Here again Nergal is the agent of calamity — probably he is to bring defeat and plunder in war. A baked cylinder in the Yale Babylonian Collection contains a mortuary inscription of SamaS-ibni, to whose remains ASSur-etil-ilâni showed much respect. According to Meissner,71 SamaS-ibni, the king of Bît-Dâkûri had died in captivity in Assyria. A§§ur-etil-ilâni, the king of Assyria, found himself in great difficulty when in 626 Nabopolassar, king of Babylon, successfully revolted against him. To win the favor of the people of Bît-Dâkûri, who had long been enemies of Babylon, he returned to them the body of Sama§-ibni to be buried in his native country. In this way he hoped to win an ally against the Babylonian menace. In the mortuary inscription for SamaS-ibni, ASSur-etil-ilâni invokes several gods, to punish the ruler who violates the tomb. Among these invocations one mentions Nergal : May Nergal from misery, pestilence, and calamity not protect his life.72 Here the deity is conceived as one who can at his pleasure bring or withhold all forms of calamity. Such a terrible god could afflict any man who acted improperly. 70 E. Ebeling, B. Meissner, E. F.

A source of information about Nergal yet to be examined is the extant mythological material. From the tell Aqar Quf, the ancient Dûr-Kurigalzu, there have come four inscribed fragments of a larger than-life statue of the Kassite king Kurigalzu. These Sumerian fragments are quite obscure for a number of reasons. Neither do the fragments fit together, nor do we know how much of the text is missing between them. At best the extent of the text is but a small portion of the whole. There are some words that are not known. Mcst confusing of all is the fact that the signs are grouped in columns by two's and three's without regard to sense. In view of these facts, it is not sur prising that the text may be translated only tentatively. Nevertheless it seems that the subject is the powers and duties of the gods.

The myth of "Ishtar's Descent to the Underworld" is a Semitic version of an old Sumerian myth. The narrative opens with I§tar's descending to the nether regions. She obtains entrance only by a conditional curse to which we shall return below. Once Istar was in the realm of the dead and stripped of all her divine apparel, EreSkigal ordered her imprisoned and afflicted with all the most terrible miseries. Since man and beast had lost sexual interest during her imprisonment, Ea planned to liberate her and therefore created a eunuch of very pleasant form. Descending to the nether world this eunuch won the favor of EreSkigal and exacted of her a boon. His request was for the release of I§tar. EreSkigal was greatly angered but released the captive goddess. The conclusion is obscure but seems to indicate that Istar had gone to the lower regions to rescue Tammuz. The demand for entry to the underworld is couched in the following terms: 0 watcher, open the gate ! Open the gate that I may enter! If you do not open the gate, 1 will break the threshold, I will tear down the doors, I will shatter the boundary wall The dead shall rise, they shall devour the living, The living will be more numerous than the dead.81 Since resurrection is not a normal characteristic of Akkadian religion, the threat of IStar is somewhat surprising. This passage indicates that there was always a possibility that a deity with the proper power could raise the dead to life. If this possibility were carried out, however, it would have been a curse rather than a blessing, for the resurrected dead would Outnumber the living and the former would consume the latter. Thus though the dead might be raised, it was assumed to be better if they remained dead.82 In the old Sumerian version of this 81 The text was published in KAR I, No. I, by E. Ebeling and was transliterated and translated by Samuel Geller, "Die Rezension von ,,Istars Hôllenfahrt aus Assur," Orientalistische Literaturzeilung, vol. 20 (1917) col. 42.

According to Kramer,84 when Inanna rose from the underworld, the dead arose also as well as many demons who fled the nether regions. Witzel,85 however, dealing with the same passage considers that the term "the dead" is singular and refers to Tammuz, who was given to her as a gift and was borne along by the nether demons. In either case some person or persons considered dead were resurrected at the ascent of Inanna from the lower regions. In the twelfth tablet of the Gilgamesh Epic there is a narrative that has very little to do with the rest of the epic.86 Gilgamesh lost some object or objects, which apparently fell into the nether world through a hole. To regain his lost treasure he sent Enkidu with strict instructions of the taboos to observe if he wished to return from the underworld ; but the headstrong servant broke every taboo and thus was snatched by the underworld. Depressed by the turn of events, Gilgamesh sought a patron among the gods. Finally Ea hearkened to Gilgamesh's prayer, and he commanded Nergal to open a hole in the earth for the spirit of Enkidu to come forth. The underworld god complied, and Enkidu's spirit came forth like a windpuff, so that he and Gilgamesh could commune. — The shade of Enkidu is not a resurrected body, but a spirit that has no material quality. Still it is significant that this ghostly being returned to earth through the activity of Nergal. The death-god opened a hole in the earth to permit this apparition to pass. One other myth ought to be noted. This is the famous and ex world. This is an interesting transfer of the name of the old sanctuary town to the nether regions (see above, note 40). 83 The most important difference in the two recensions of the myth is to be found in the method by which the goddess was raised from the underworld. In the Sumerian account two creatures are sent to sprinkle the corpse of Inanna with the food of life and the water of life. As indicated above, in the Akkadian account Ea sent a eunuch to obtain the release of the captive Istar by a ruse. A discussion of this difference may be found in A. L. Oppenheim, "Mesopotamian Mythology III," Orientalia 19, (1950), pp. 136-139. As will be seen from this discussion the exact method employed by the eunuch to trick Ereskigal in the Akkadian version is not clear. 8&lt; See Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, vol.

So pervasive is his influence that all his worshippers are extremely good and kind like their god. It is the desire of Irra (i. e. Nergal)88 tD control the people of the city but this he cannot do as long as Marduk remains in authority. Now it happens that Marduk's crown had been damaged in the flood, thus Irra persuades Marduk to descend to the nether region for repairs to his divine emblem. It is agreed that during his absence Irra would rule over Babylon. Once the power of good is no longer effective, Irra immediately corrupts the people and their worship; he causes war, revolt, and slaughter. Temples are desecrated and devastated. Peace no longer reigns in the city. The people become like their reigning deity Irra — agents of violence and destruction. The moral of the mythological legend is summarized in the closing hymn which calls upon the people to leave room in their worship for the revering of the god of evil. In this way he might be reconciled so as not to bring further devastation. A certain Kummâa (a pseudonym meaning "the man of the city of Kume")1' figures in a literary work of the seventh century as a prince who had a dream in which he went to the underworld and saw all its inhabitants. Among his most vivid memories are those of Nergal, who sat on a royal throne wearing his regal crown and holding signs of his authority. In a violent rage the deity burst forth in a bitter accusation against the prince for allegedly slighting EreSkigal. ISum interceded on behalf of Kummâa so that he was spared; but Nergal required of him that he remember him and serve him. Accepting this command, the prince returned from the underworld, awoke, and went about preaching the worship of Nergal and EreSkigal. —Von Soden90 has pointed out that this vision is really a political apocalypse to vindicate a claimant to the throne. This, however, should not 87 This myth was, inter alia, transliterated and translated by P. Jensen, Assyrisch babylonischebabylonische Mythen und Epen (KB VI, pt. 1), pp. 57-73. Ebeling apud H. Gress mann, Altorientalische Texte zum alten Testament, pp. 213-230, also translates the myth. The interpretation given herein, however, was derived from an interview with Dr. Hildegard Lewy, who graciously consented for me to use this as yet un published interpretation. 88 That Irra is identical with Nergal is seen from considerable evidence cited by Tallqvist, Akkadische Gotterepitheta, p. 329. See inter alia CT 24:36, 54.25:35; KAR 142, III 26; K 268+K. 5333. 8'According to K. L. Tallqvist, Assyrian Personal Names, p. 118, the name Ku-ma-a-a means "the man of the city of Kume." »0Wolfram von Soden, "Die Unterweltsvision eines assyrischen Kronprinzen," Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie 43 (1936), pp. 7 ff.</page><page sequence="31">[31] THE MOUNT OF OLIVES IN TRADITION 167 deter us from using the material in it, for the writer must have used fairly conventional symbols in his own arrangement to present his message. The emotional outburst of the deity is described as follows: 51 51 ' Nergal 55. machte gegen mich gewaltig sein [Geb]rull und schrie voll Wut wie ein he[ulen] der Sturm gegen mich; den Stab, der seiner Gottheit ziemt, der wie eine Giftschlange voll der Furchtbarkeit ist, 56. schleift er [ge]gen mich, um [mich] zu tôten." The terrifying picture of Nergal is characteristic — roaring mightily, shrieking, and full of fury, he may be compared to a howling storm. The raging deity wielded his staff, his divine symbol, against the help less prince; this weapon is full of terror like a poisonous snake. -— It is worthwhile to note that ultimately Nergal was deterred from his intent to kill Kummâa ; in a sense at least he proved gracious. Though this is a dream and not an actual descent into the nether world, it is significant that at the close of the actual dream the prince ascends back to earth. On basis of the literature examined above, we must conclude that Nergal was primarily a god of evil forces. As god of the underworld, he ruled over the dead and eagerly sought by every means to increase the population of his realm. Thus he came to be considered the god of any force causing death. As a violent god who delights in causing death and calamity, he is invoked to destroy evildoers and is con sidered to give victory in battle. A worshipper seeking to avoid un timely death would worship Nergal, believing that such devotion would prevent the deity from becoming angry. Euphemistically the devotee would call Nergal a gracious deity in hope that by so doing he would avoid bringing calamity to himself. " Ibid., pp. 17, 23 f.

Reflections of the Nergal Cult in the Biblical and Post-Biblical Traditions92 Since it has been established that the Mount of Olives was the seat of a Nergal cult, we must seek to see how far this cult influenced events centering in the hill. Hildegard Lewy93 has shown that Jerusalem from very ancient times was a city holy to Salim or Ninurta, the violent and destructive god of the planet Saturn. There is no need to survey her evidence here, but there is need to see the relation of the Salim cult to the Mount of Olives and to the cult of Nergal. For this purpose we must return to some OT narratives that were mentioned above. The flight of David from Absalom in II Samuel 15 seems to be more than a simple retreat. The king is showing open signs of grief and mourning; this is to be expected since his pampered son has raised a revolt against him. However, the people of the country are also in open grief at this time (v. 23), though the knowledge of the revolt is not yet widespread. It is, therefore, possible that the revolt was not the only cause of sorrow but that the people were performing a ritual mourning for a deity. This is made more probable by the fact that the ark is carried along with David a certain distance until he bids the Levites carry it back to the city (vv. 24 ff.). Thus it may be that the Mount of Olives was originally the site of the akitu-shrine of Salim. To such a shrine the symbol of the deity would be brought at certain times when the deity was thought to have descended to the under world, and from this shrine it would be returned at the appropriate time to the shrine of the deity within the city for the enthronement of the deity. On this supposition the mountain was originally a Ninurta shrine. It is recorded that David customarily worshipped (ישתחוה) certain אלהים on the height (see above, p. 139). It is certainly probable that Ninurta was among the אלהים, but for the following reason it is likely that also Nergal was revered there. It was assumed by the ancient Semites that each country was the property of its national god, who appointed an earthly ruler to administer it in his name. In order to be chosen by the god for this office, it was necessary for a prince to worship ני Some of the material dealt with in this chapter was discussed by Dr. Julian Morgenstern in lectures which I had the privilege to attend. While profiting from his views, I could not concur with his attribution of the phenomena here discussed to solar worship.

Thus Sulmânu-asarid, when he desired to place himself under the special protection of the god of Jerusalem, founded the city of Kal[1u, the Assyrian residence of the god Ninurta.94 Therefore it is probable that when David sought to take the territory of the Moabites and the Ammonites, he expressed his devotion to Kemô§ and Môlek, the divine patrons of these countries, by estab lishing a shrine for them in the immediate vicinity of his capital city. Thus it is possible that the Nergal cult was not transplanted to Jerusalem until the time of David. The Mount of Olives was an appropriate site for the newly transplanted cult, for a planetary deity normally would be invoked on a high place, since such a place was closer to the heavenly abode of the astral gods than the plain. If, as seems likely, the mountain was already sacred to Ninurta, the new shrine could be added to the holy precincts with ease. Thus it was only natural that Solomon should erect a shrine to Môlek and Kemô§ at the sacred area outside the city (I Kings 11.7). Once the worship was established it persisted tenaciously long after Israel had lost control of the original abode of the two deities. The Nergal priesthood would jealously guard their right to preserve the worship of their deity lest they become unemployed. The pious could be convinced that to discontinue the cult once established would mean to incur the wrath of the violent god. Thus the worship once accepted into the mountain sanctuary would necessarily continue. When Josiah began his violent purge of all matters pertaining to the cult of deities other than Yahweh in the religion of Israel, it was only natural that his wrath should fall upon the Nergal shrine on Olivet. But his efforts were not to succeed. The figure of the god of death was too well implanted in the minds of the people to be for gotten. Indeed under the term המשחית Nergal as agent of death was probably incorporated into the orthodox tradition of the Passover (Ex. 12.23); he became the angel of death who brought the final plague to the Egyptians. Even the Deuteronomist, who was an exponent of the Josianic reform, records in the same breath his gleeful account of the razing of the Olivet shrines, but still calls the mountain the property of Nergal — הר־המשחית. The prophetic mention of הר־המשחית (Jer. 51.25) with reference to Babylon is logical in this light, for the prophet looked for a catch-phrase to apply to the conqueror — a catch-phrase which could be applied to the overlord positively but which was capable of a negative twist. Since in Babylonia Nergal was worshipped " Ibid., p. 333.</page><page sequence="34">170 JOHN BRIGGS CURTIS [34] and normally on a height, this land could be called הר־המשחית "the mountain of the destroyer." Yahweh, in the words of the prophet, will be a destroyer to the mountain of the destroyer. The verse concludes ונתתיך להר שרפה "I will make you a mountain of burning." This logically applies also to Nergal, for he was a god especially of underworld fire. Tallqvist even lists Sar-ra-pu (CT 25:35, 24! 36, Rs 30; 37, 20) "the one who burns (other people)"95 as an epithet of Nergal. The words "I will make you a mountain of burning" could be taken as a favorable statement by Nergal worshippers were this not a passage of prophetic irony. It is interesting that the Kidron Valley at the foot of the Mount of Olives is today called Wâdy en-Nâr, "valley of fire." So near to the precincts sacred to Nergal, the name is quite logical and is probably a memory of a very ancient name or concept. In Ezra's command to the people to go out to the mountain to gather boughs for the booths (Neh. 8.15), we may have nothing more than a chance event without significance for our problem. But since Nergal was a god of life and especially of vegetation, it is possible that the sukkoth festival may originally have had some connection with that god. This becomes apparent if one notes that one of the names of Nergal is Lugal-gi§-gi§immar "king of the date-palm." For it was required that the sukkah be built, in part, of date palm branches. If these were collected, as seems likely, from the Mount of Olives, the area sacred to Nergal, it is possible that in very ancient times, the sukkoth festival was related to agricultural functions of Nergal. The strange vision of Zech. 14.4 pictures Yahweh standing on the mountain, while it is cleft in two from east to west with one half proceeding to the south and the other to the north, leaving a great cleft between. The vision, however, is not clear as to its continu ation or meaning. Among the murals in the synagogue at Dura Europos there is a representation of Ezekiel's vision of the valley of dry bones (Ezek. 37). From the facsimile at this mural (fig. 1) it will be noted that about the ground lie portions of human bodies, while near the center are some bodies assembled but still dead. Just to the right of center are four spirits of the wind which apparently give life by breathing upon the corpses. Across the top of the mural are four outstretched hands, apparently of Yahweh, who is raising the dead. Just to the left of center is a great mountain that is cleft in the midst. Atop each half of the mountain is a tree, while on the right half is a house that is crumbling. This cleft mountain does not fit into Ezekiel's 5י Tallqvist, "Akkadische Gôtterepitheta" Studia Orientalia, vol. VII, pp. 391, 462.</page><page sequence="35">[35] THE MOUNT OF OLIVES IN TRADITION 171 vision in any way; thus it is necessary to explain it by external data. The author of the official preliminary report of the excavations at Dura-Europos tries to explain this feature: The mountain in the scene I should be inclined to interpret as the "mountains of Israel" (Ezek. 6, 2 et al.) ; the city or temple tumbling down might represent the destruction of the "high places" and cities mentioned in this connection (Ezek. 6, 3-4) or the destruction of Jerusalem or the temple itself; the nude figures at the foot of the mountain may be the "dead carcasses of the children of Israel" (6,5) or the "slain" who have fallen in the midst of the mountain.96 Rachel Wischnitzer97 explains the mountain by the vague refer ence to "the prophecy that the mountain will disappear in messianic times" (see Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, IV, 234). According to Kraeling'8 the cleft and the house are meant to suggest the earthquake of Ezek. 37.7. Clearly, of these suggestions Kraeling's is the most satisfactory. Nevertheless, the cleft does not yet seem to have been completely explained. Such a phenomenon must remind us of Zech. 14.4, the only clear occurrence of the cleft motif in the Bible. It seems that the artist has combined the split in the mountain from Zechariah with the resurrection from Ezekiel. This is the logical combination, for if there was a popular reminiscence that the Mount of Olives was sacred to the god of the dead and of the underworld, it could be assumed to contain an entrance to the realm of the dead. The deep crevasse, which is enigmatic in Zechariah, has a real meaning in the mural, for here it is the exit from the nether world for the dead. The combination of motifs found in the Dura mural is probably not unique, for in a Christian miniature of the ninth century there seems to be the same resurrection scene from Ezekiel combined with the cleft in the mountain.99 Figure 2 shows that, while the details are 96 M.

A figure similar to these is found in Tablet XII of the Gilgamesh Epic, when Nergal opens a hole in the earth for the spirit of Enkidu to emerge forth to talk with Gilgamesh. The author of Zechariah 14 probably had some idea of resurrection in mind; this his readers would understand although it was not set forth explicitly. That the resur rection was associated with the Mount of Olives is confirmed by some further elements of tradition. Ginzberg100 cites what he considers the incomplete text of Ma'aseh Daniel, 128, where it is stated that the Messiah will ascend the Mount of Olives with Elijah and Zerubbabel, whereupon Elijah, at the bidding of the Messiah, will blow the trum pet. Though the text is incomplete, the intent is obvious. The blowing of the trumpet is a very frequent apocalyptic element which signifies the calling forth of the dead for the resurrection (I Cor. 15.52; I Thess. 4.16; Isa. 27.13; Ber. 13b; Tar. Jer. to Ex. 20.15; II Esd. 4.23, et al.). Now the raising of the dead can find no more logical place than through an opening at the ancient sanctuary of the god of death. Jewish tradition, on occasion, would insist that the resurrection could take place only at some place in the land of Palestine. Those who are to to be raised from outside the land must be rolled through subterranean tunnels to the land, and there be raised (Pesikta Rab. referring to Ezek. 37.13; Ket. ina). This insistence upon the special position of the land in the resurrection is a logical carry-over from the ancient tradition of the death sanctuary in the land. The motif of the כבוד יהוה, which withdrew to the Mount of Olives according to Ezek. 11.23, occurs also in rabbinic literature (Mid. Rab. Lam. Proem 25). The rabbis felt that the Shekinah (this term is substituted for כבוד יהוה of Ezekiel) was very sad about the withdrawal and was urging the people to repent. However, this is probably not the intent of the prophet. He probably means to say that the patron deity abandoned the city to the god of destruction. By withdrawing his presence and protection from the city, Yahweh permitted his city to suffer violent devastation. Indeed his standing upon the mountain must mean that he permits the death-god a free hand. Perhaps even Yahweh is commanding Nergal to go and destroy what is before him. The similarities between this event and the Irra myth are considerable, for in both cases the protecting deity leaves his city to the care of Nergal and in each the metropolis falls victim to destruction. ' Louis Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, vol. VI, p. 438.</page><page sequence="37">[37] THE MOUNT OF OLIVES IN TRADITION 173 The Mount of Olives figures prominently in the career of Jesus, and almost every event recalls the ancient worship at this site. The most significant occurrence is the withdrawal on the night of his arrest. After a meal on the first evening of Passover,101 he went out to the Mount of Olives to wrestle with the grisly problem before him — to be a martyr or to escape (Mk. 14.26). At a place called Gethsemane, he sought his answer while his disciples remained apart in two groups (Mk. 14.32 ff.). After an agonizing struggle he became reconciled to death and from this time on accepted the end without swerving. We cannot keep from feeling that no more suitable place could have been chosen than the sanctuary of the god of the dead for his final commit ment to death. If Nergal entered the tradition under the title המשחית (the agent of death at the exodus), it should be remembered that the night of Jesus' withdrawal to the mountain was celebrated as the anniversary of the passing of the death-angel in Egypt. Perhaps in this night more than in any other, the presence of the underworld god could be experienced on the mountain. In Luke's account of the triumphal entry, there is an incident peculiar to the gospel (19.41-44). As Jesus reaches the crest of the mount of Olives, he pauses and proclaims: Would that even today you knew the things that make for peace! But now they are hid from your eyes. For the days shall come upon you, when your enemies will cast up a bank about you and surround you, and hem you in on every side, and dash you to the ground, you and your children within you, and they will not leave one stone upon another in you; because you did not know the time of your visitation (Luke 19.42-44 RSV). Very similar is the event of Mark 13, which Matthew and Luke copy with variations. This chapter is highly complex and difficult, but in its present form it opens with a pronouncement story that con eludes with the proclaiming of the doom of the temple. Then very deliberately Jesus withdraws to the Mount of Olives and gives a long discourse. The confusion of the speech is remarkable, but among other things Jesus pronounces the final absolute doom of Jerusalem and of the world. Since the agent of destruction for Jerusalem was war, he was, in a sense, devoting the city to the god of war. All that he saw was displeasing, so he dedicated all to the powers of destruction, violence, war, and death. The powers of annihilation were invoked to come and make an end to everything that was worthy only of 101 According to the Synoptic tradition, Jesus ate a passover meal with his disciples, but according to John he was crucified before the beginning of Passover.</page><page sequence="38">174 JOHN BRIGGS CURTIS [38] death.—Jesus' actions in these cases were entirely too deliberate to be chance. The doom of the city might have been proclaimed any where, but the most appropriate place was the sanctuary of the god of doom, and to this he retired for his assertion. One of the most frequent interpretations of the work of Christ in the NT is in terms of the death motif (see, e. g., Romans 5, I Cor. 15, Heb. 2, et al.). According to this view man was under the control of death, living in fear of death, and without hope, until Christ through dying conquered death and gained a victory for all mankind. The most striking passages dealing with this theme are Hebrews 2.14 f. and I Peter 3.18-20, both of which have been dealt with previously. The former asserts that he tasted death so that he might destroy him who has the power of death and thereby deliver all who lived in fear of death ; the latter tells of Christ who, while dead, went in the spirit to preach to the spirits in prison who were disobedient in the days of Noah. The terminology here is the kind that we could expect since Jesus voluntarily chose the death-myth as the background for his martyrdom. By some stratagem he dedicated himself to the death-god, descended into his realm, by some means defeated him in his own domain, and ascended from the depths of the earth as victor. The final declaration of his achievement was in his ascending into heaven from Olivet, the old death sanctuary. Matthew records that at the time of the death of Jesus many saints were bodily raised and that they came forth from the tombs after his resurrection to appear to many in the city (27.31 ff.). This again reflects the idea of the defeat of the powers of death through the death of Jesus. This resurrection of the saints at the time of the resurrection of Jesus is represented in a Byzantine fresco in the Mosque of Ka'riye at Istanbul.102 Prior to the Moslem period this sanctuary was the Church of the Blessed Saviour of Chora. Dating from the Palaeologan Dynasty (i. e. the period between the time the Crusaders were driven out of Constantinople and the capture of the city by the Turks), the fresco shows the resurrection, with Jesus in flowing white robes, raising Adam and Eve from the dead. These three central figures are surrounded by a number of persons, whose meaning is not clear. We cannot but be impressed with the interest of the church in the motif of the raising of the dead at the resurrection of Jesus. Nor can we fail to notice the similarity of this concept to that of the raising of the dead with Inanna, when she ascended from the lower world. — Our only conclusion from this very frequent NT 103 J. O. Haff, "Great Art Lines Mosque's Walls," New York Times, Sat., July 28, 1956, p. 19.</page><page sequence="39">[39] THE MOUNT OF OLIVES IN TRADITION 175 concept is that primitive Christianity adopted motifs from the Nergal mythology and adapted these to its usage. The precedent for such thinking was the OT and Jesus himself, both of which use the myths of the underworld god for their own purposes. As was pointed out above, pp. 147 f., the devil took on certain characteristics of Nergal in early Christianity. Notably a few passages mention him as the god of death and the dead. One other feature should here be indicated. As was pointed out in the preceding chapter, Nergal is called "a lion, clothed with terror" and is probably to be connected with certain lion colossi. In I Peter 5.8 we read: Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour (RSV). This description cannot but remind us of the Nergal terminology. Since I Peter twice (3.18 ff. ; 5.8) considers the devil in terms similar to Nergal, this may reflect on the question of origin. In 5.13 we have a reference to Babylon in such a way that we think that the letter was written from this city. Now it is frequently argued that Babylon at this time was a town of no consequence and thus the name must mean Rome, for Revelation uses the name "Babylon" to refer to the eternal city (16.19; 17.5; 18.3). Since the letter twice reflects Nergal terminology, it is possible the reference to Babylon, where the author contacted afresh remnants of the old Nergal-cult and identified this deity with the devil, may be given serious consideration. Josephus records that, among robbers and imposters in the land in the time of procurator Felix during the reign of Nero, was a certain Egyptian who claimed to be a prophet and rallied about himself 30,000 men for an attack on the city from the Mount of Olives (BJ II.II. XIII 5). This man urged the common people to go with him to the Mount of Olives, where he promised that at his command the walls of Jerusalem would fall {Ant. XX.VIII 6). Obviously the details that Josephus gives in the two accounts differ, but it can be taken for certain that the prophet involved here had one intent in mind: he would invoke the god of war who inhabited the mountain to wreak his destruction upon the city. At the same time the army would consecrate itself to the deity and would devote their victims to the war-god. The same purpose may have been in the mind of the Romans, when they chose to make their major camp on the Mount of Olives during the siege of the city (B. J., V. II 3). —• It should bè immedi ately obvious that the prophet mentioned by Josephus did exactly what Jesus did when he deliberately withdrew to Olivet to pronounce the doom of the city.</page><page sequence="40">176 JOHN BRIGGS CURTIS [40] Certain other data pertaining to the Mount of Olives are preserved by tradition but these do not so obviously reflect the mythology of Nergal. Among the many rites of purification detailed in the Mishnah, that of the red heifer may be related to Nergal. It was required that the heifer be burned to ashes on the Mount of Olives (Parah 3:6-11). The OT law requires simply that the burning take place "outside the camp" (Num. 19.3) without exact specification of the place. It is stated that all who are involved in the rite become unclean (Parah 4:4), though the ashes mixed with water were for purification (Num. 19.11 ff.). It is possible that the whole performance was related to Nergal. It may have been the concept that the sins of the people were committed to the heifer, which then was burned as a sacrifice to the god of death. The sins were thus borne away to the realm of the dead and were gone forever. If this is the original meaning of the rite, then the Jewish law-givers adopted into Judaism a practice not originating in the cult of Yahweh and sought to give it an orthodox meaning. Such a move could have occurred to placate the worshippers of Ner gal, who stubbornly clung to the old worship on the Mount of Olives. In Rosh Ha-shanah 2, we read of a practice that finds no place in the Bible — the lighting of fires on the hill-tops to declare that the new moon has been observed. The first of these signal-fires was kindled on the Mount of Olives and then on heights all about the land (R. H. 2:4). This practice had to be discontinued because of the deeds of the Samaritans who apparently kindled fires at the wrong times (R. H. 2:2). Since Nergal was a fire-god, it may have been that these fire rites were originally related to him; but if so, their original meaning is not clear. The author of the Testament of Naphtali 5 claims to have had a vision on the Mount of Olives. This vision has basically astral symbols in it, but the meaning given to these symbols has no real value here. Olivet was undoubtedly a place for the receiving of revelations from Nergal from ancient times. It is not suprising then to find a person claiming to receive a stellar revelation on that hill.103 One idea that is completely worthless from the point of view of our problem is that the dove returning to Noah brought the olive branch from the Mount of Olives (PRE 23; BR 33.; et al. See Ginzberg, op.op. cit., I, 164; V, 185 f.). This certainly has nothing to do with the ancient Nergal cult; it only vindicates the rabbinic idea that Canaan was spared the devastation of the flood. 1נ" See H. Lewy, loc. cit., pp. 331 f., 358, for information regarding revelations at sacred places, especially those sacred to star deities.</page><page sequence="41">[41] THE MOUNT OF OLIVES IN TRADITION 177 Krauss104, in a pair of articles, shows that the Jews as late as the Arabic period regarded the Mount of Olives as the most sacred place in the entire land.
