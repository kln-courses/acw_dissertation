<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jacob Neusner There Has Never Been a Judaeo-Christian Dialogue But There Can Be One 1. There Has Never Been a Judaeo-Christian Dialogue How do we know whether or not dialogue takes place? Three criteria dictate the answer: 1) each party proposes to take seriously the position of the other; 2) each party concedes the integrity of the other; 3) each party accepts responsibility for the outcome of discussion, that is, re mains open to the possibility of conceding the legitimacy of the other's viewpoint. These criteria have rarely been met in the history of Christian theologians' address to Judaism, and Jewish theologians' address to Christianity. In fact, when representatives of the two religions have writ ten as though to each other, they turn out to have been speaking to their own communities: letters written to the outsider, but sent home in stamped, self-addressed envelopes. Whether the writers expected the outsider to read and respond to what was said hardly matters; only rarely did theologians write as if they knew (or cared) what the outsider would grasp. Judaeo-Christian dialogue (or disputation, the word-choice hardly matters) formed an exercise in inner-facing apologetics. Judaic contributions to dialogue have served only to resist Christian ity's insistence that the sole point worth discussing is why the Jews do Jacob Neusnbr, who teaches at the University of South Florida, is among the most prolific authors of our time. This essay recapitulates parts of the argument of his latest book, forthcoming from Westminster/John Knox Press. SPRING 1992</page><page sequence="2">not convert to Christianity; no Judaic participant in interreligious dia logue before modern times conceded that Christianity bore a legitimate relationship to God's revealed Torah. So far as dialogue rests upon shared principles of reason and logic and a mutually accepted corpus of facts, Judaism has only episodically found itself a participant to dialogue. And the same applies, until quite recently, to Christianity. All Chris tianity has asked Judaism is, Why have you not accepted Jesus Christ and so gone out of business? That Judaism sustained a distinctive cov enant with God has never, before this time, entered the mind of Chris tianity; that Jews sincerely and honestly believe in and practice Judaism lies beyond the imagination of Christianity, which sees Jews as stubborn and perverse; and never did a Christian participant in dialogue suppose that the outcome of debate and discussion might encompass a change in attitude or viewpoint. Only rarely have theologians speaking for the two great traditions ad dressed a common set of issues. Conditions for debate did not accord equal standing to both sides. In no way can we characterize the discourse that took place from the fifth century to the twentieth as an interesting argument about issues important to each side, defined in the same way by each party to the discussion. Quite the contrary. The issues facing the Judaic participants bore a political, and not an intellectual character. The rights of Jews to live where and how they did were at stake in the dis putations, whether medieval, whether modern; the beliefs of the Jews about the meaning and end of history, the Messiah in the end of days, and the definition of Israel, scarcely came up. And, when they did, Christians framed the issue, and Jews responded to the Christian fram ing of the issue: Why do you not believe? Nor, in their response, did the Jewish participants vastly improve on matters. They simply ridiculed the Christians' convictions: "they lacked both ratio and auctoritas," being de void of scriptural foundation and without logical justification. No debate there, scarcely an intellectual confrontation. No one should find it surprising, therefore, that when the National Socialists came to power, German Christianity found nothing to say to the Jews or to Judaism other than that, despite the loathsome character of "the Jewish race," the Jews could still hope to experience the love and grace (and protection) of Christianity, if only they would convert. That no dialogue had ever taken place is best shown by the final dialogue that did take place between Judaism and Christianity in Germany, before the destruction of the Jews and Judaism in Germany between 1933 and 1945. On January 14th, 1933, the eve of the National Socialists' rise to power, 4 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="3">Karl Ludwig Schmidt, meeting Martin Buber for the last disputation be tween German Judaism and German Christianity, extended to Israel the invitation to brotherhood with Christians—"but only as sons of a Ger many united through the Christian conception of the Church as the spir itual Israel." The final voice of Christianity addressed to German and European Jew ry repeated the first and only message that Christianity had ever deliv ered to Judaism: "God has willed all this; Jesus, the Messiah rejected by his people, prophesied the destruction of Jerusalem. Jerusalem has been destroyed, so that it will never again come under Jewish rule." A pre cursor of the contemporary Christian judgment on Zionism, Schmidt went on, "The modern world reacts to Zionism, which is national or even racist." He warns the Jews standing on the brink of destruction: "the Church of Jesus Christ has again and again shown her want of this Jewry, demonstrating her patience by waiting in hope that finally the Jews also . . . will be able to perceive that only the Church of the Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth, is the people of God, chosen by God, and that the Jews should become incorporated in it, if they indeed feel themselves as Is rael." So much for German Christianity, fully aware of the coming tri umph of National Socialism in their country. For his part, Martin Buber answered in these words: I live not far from the city of Worms, to which I am bound by the tra dition of my forefathers; and from time to time I go there. When I go, I first go to the cathedral. It is a visible harmony of members, a totality in which no part deviates from perfection. I walk about the cathedral with consum mate joy, gazing at it. Then I go over to the Jewish cemetery, consisting of crooked, cracked, shapeless, random stones. I station myself there, gaze upward from the jumble of a cemetery to that glorious harmony, and seem to be looking up from Israel to the Church. Below, there is no jot of form; there are only the stones and the dust lying beneath the stones. The dust is there, no matter how thinly scattered. There lies the corporeality of man, which has turned to this. There it is. There it is for me. There it is for me, not as corporeality within the space of this planet, but as corporeality in my own memory, far into the depths of history, as far back as Sinai ... I have stood there and have experienced everything myself; with all this death has confronted me, all the dust, all the ruin, aU the world's misery is mine; but the covenant has not been withdrawn from me. I lie on the ground, like these stones. But it has not been withdrawn from me. The ca thedral is as it is, the cemetery is as it is. But nothing has been withdrawn from us. No reasonable person, however sympathetic with Buber's situation, can find in these remarks a serious address to Christianity; all Buber finds to SPRING 1992</page><page sequence="4">say is that, it is true, Christianity owns the world, but we are what we are: "nothing has been withdrawn from us." A dialogue would have re quired an address to the other's proposition, evidence, and argument. No wonder that, at the end, Karl Ludwig Schmidt found no moral re sources upon which to draw a message appropriate to an ancient partner in argument. Even after World War II, when what Germany had done to the Jews was well known, a number of German Christian theologians an nounced to the Jews that the murder of European Jewry constituted God's punishment of the Jews for not accepting Christ. That response, seen by many as despicable, represented the perfectly reasonable con clusion for the Christian party to the dialogue to draw. For, through time, the Judaeo-Christian dialogue had provided Christians with the opportunity to express to Jews their loathing of Judaism and their con tempt for Jews. Meanwhile, loathing and contempt gave the Jewish part ner ready access to the high road. The partners to dialogue passed in the dark, going each in his own direction, aware of the other's presence chiefly in fantasy. A Jew who would find persuasive arguments in favor of Christianity even as it paraded its racist bigotry, a Christian who would find compelling a Judaic response framed in terms of God's mystery—so degraded a Jew, so disingenuous a Christian—never lived. I myself heard the German theologian, Wolfhart Pannenberg, at a Judaeo-Christian dialogue at Harvard Divinity School in 1966, deliver precisely the same message that Rosenzweig heard from Rosenstock Huessy, and that Buber heard from Karl Ludwig Schmidt. The only ques tion worth discussing, he maintained, is why Jews continue not to accept Jesus Christ, this under the auspices of the Harvard Divinity School and the American Jewish Committee. The death of nearly six-million Jews had made no difference; what Schmidt said at the outset of the National Socialist period, Pannenberg said after its end. Nor is this only memory; he wrote the same: "With the message of the resurrection . . . the foun dations of the Jewish religion collapsed." Some dialogue! It was not even a disputation. Christian aggression, Judaic dissimulation—nothing more. Not only has there been no dia logue, there has not been even a moment of reflection on the require ments of dialogue, beginning, after all, with the condescension of courtesy—the condition of discourse if anyone really wants to talk. What we shall now see is that neither Judaic nor Christian parties to dialogue have had any such intention. For each, dialogue provided the occasion of a monologue in affirmation of the faith. That is what I mean by "a con spiracy of hypocrites"—the hypocrisy being the pretense that one 6 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="5">wished to conduct dialogue, the conspiracy being the agreement to pre tend the matters at stake were of concern to the other party at all. Then what was at stake? The only open question is, why should either party have taken the trouble to pretend to wish to talk with the other? Dialogue turns out to have served the quite autonomous requirements of theolog ical apologetics. Why, from the beginnings, Christian writers wrote about outsiders, including Jews, requires no explanation. Every group defines itself by designating the other. Christian writers invented the Judaism with which they then fabricated dialogue. Whether in ancient or medieval or modern times, the issue remained constant and entirely comprehensible. In the language of F. C. Bauer: . . . how Christianity, instead of remaining a mere form of Judaism ... as serted itself as a separate, independent principle, broke loose from it, and took its stand as a new enfranchised form of religious thought and life, es sentially different from all the national peculiarities of Judaism, is the ul timate, most important point of the primitive history of Christianity. It goes without saying that the same mode of thought found it possible also to define, set apart and contrast Petrine and Pauline Christianity; as time has passed, a variety of Christianities have found definition, e.g., Gentile Christianity, Hellenistic Christianity, and the like. In all cases, if we know one thing about a system—e.g., a document that permits us to classify it under the rubric, "Gentile Christianity"—then we know much else about that document that the writing itself does not contain. What Judaism did Christianity invent for itself? The conversation partner fabricated by Christianity hardly presented a worthy participant in dialogue, or even debate and disputation. "Judaism" served Christi anity as a foil, that alone. Invented for the purpose of polemic and apol ogetic, "Judaism" was so defined as to form a caricature, a mere anti Christianity, the opposite, the other—the worst possible choice in contrast to the best possible choice. So this "it" was "a narrow, legalistic religion. Pharisees taught a religion of 'works-righteousness,' of salva tion earned by merit. . . thus providing a stark foil for the gospel of Jesus and of Paul, who, in contrast, brought a religion of forgiveness and grace." It would be difficult to show more graphically how critical to the study of the theology of Christianity is the concept of an ism, in this case, a Judaism: a theological category, defined in theological terms. But the discourse goes awry as soon as we invoke some other category than the theological and speak of the entire composite of beliefs and practices that characterized all the faithful of (a particular) Israel. From earliest times to SPRING 1992 7</page><page sequence="6">the present, Christians have invented a Judaism with which they pro posed to conduct not a dialogue but a monologue. So far as people made up dialogues, e.g., Justin with Trypho, or so far as theologians or schol ars imagined that they were arguing one side of a debate with a real op ponent, we have to classify them as either misguided or hypocritical. For its part, Judaism not only did not conduct a dialogue with Chris tianity, it did not even deign to admit (unless forced to) that in the world there was such a thing, to be taken seriously, as Christianity. In ancient times, while Christian writers from the Evangelists onward addressed the world beyond the faithful, Judaic writers never explicitly conceded the existence of Christianity in the world. Responding to the unpleasant fact of life that most of Israel, the Jewish people, ignored the new reading of the ancient Scripture and the new faith that came out of that reading, Christianity invented a Judaism with which to conduct disputations or debates. Judaism, in turn, responded to the unpleasant fact of the advent of Christianity with—on the surface—sedulous indifference. True, veiled references to Jesus may occur here and there, e.g., when sages spoke of Balaam, prophet to the gentiles. And I have argued that important points of emphasis in rabbinic documents, brought to closure in the century after the conversion of Constantine, responded to signif icant claims addressed to Judaism by Christianity vis à vis the Messiah, the Torah, and the identification of Israel. But such allusions—if that is what they are—and so subtle a dispute on critical issues addressing both parties to the debate—if that is what it was—hardly correspond, on the Judaic side, to the articulated and vigorous presentation, to Judaism, of the case for Jesus Christ set forth whether in the Gospels and the Letters of Paul or in the great tractates of Justin, Aphrahat, and the other Fa thers of the Church. In fact, there was a Judaic position on Christianity, and we need not locate it only in the sour portrait of Balaam on the one side, or in the im plicit and merely tacit restatement of Israel's positions on Messiah, To rah, and Israel contained in free-standing documents of the fifth century on the other. That position consisted of three propositions, one in doc uments that probably reached closure prior to the conversion of Constan tine, the other two in those that came as a later reaction. The positions are easily stated. First, Christians pervert the truth, because, unlike the pagans, they have the Torah, but they corrupt and falsify it. Second, Christians are indeed related to Israel, but illegitimately so: the bad seed of Jacob. And, it goes without saying, Jesus was a man of poor morals. To the first-century authority, Tarfon, is attributed the angry observation 8 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="7">that there were people around who knew the truth of the Torah but re jected it. So states a saying assigned to him in a document that reached closure, it would seem, around A.D. 300: The books of the Evangelists and the books of the minim they do not save from the fire [on the Sabbath], They are allowed to bum up where they are, they and [even] the references to the Divine Name that are in them . . . Said R. Tarfon, "May I bury my sons if such things come into my hands and I do not bum them, and even the references to the Divine Name which are in them. And if someone was running after me, I should escape into the temple of idolatry, but I should not go into their houses of worship. For idolaters do not recognize the Divinity in denying him, but these recognize the Divinity and deny him. About them Scripture states, "Behind the door and the doorpost you have set your symbol for deserting me, you have un covered your bed (Is. 57:8)." (Tosefta Shabbat 13:5) This statement has long persuaded scholars that the rabbinic authority recognized the difference between pagans and those minim (that is, her etics) whom we can reasonably assume to be Christian. When Christians came under discussion, they appear as a source of exasperation, not as Israel's counterpart and opposite, let alone as rulers of the world and pre cursors to Israel's final triumph in history. Second, the Christian empire, Rome, is situated in relationship to Israel, a concession that one gentile nation differs from all the others. Such a concession is possible only within the framework of the Torah, and, as we shall now see, sages con cede that Christian Rome relates to Israel in the way in which Israel today relates to ancient Israel,that is, genealogically. In this way the sibling is acknowledged. But, when we examine the striking representation of Rome that surfaces in compilations of rabbinic exegesis of Scripture brought to closure after the fourth century, we can recognize the polemic contained within that concession. Rome is represented as Israel's brother—the illegitimate one, Abraham's or Jacob's bad seed. Rome is identified with Ishmael or Edom or Esau. Rome, acknowledged as a rel ative in a way in which no other nation ever was acknowledged, is rep resented as the one thing standing in the way of Israel's, and the world's, ultimate salvation. So, in the person of Rome, now Christian, Christian ity is represented as a ghastly mistake. Judaism's dialogue with Chris tianity in ancient times consisted of 1) the denial implicit in the ubiqui tous pretense that Christianity does not exist anyhow; 2) the allusion to people who should know better; 3) the representation of Rome as the fourth monarchy, standing in Israel's way, but only for a brief interval; and 4) the vilification of Jesus. Whether a more worthy dialogue is ac SPRING1992 9</page><page sequence="8">complished by inventing an opponent or pretending there is no oppo nent but discrediting him anyhow is not a productive issue. Medieval and modern times brought forth variations on the theme that, anyhow, Christianity never really mattered. Forced to debate under threatening circumstances, Judaic sages in medieval times with great tact but also with surpassing courage formulated issues in an articulated way, facing Christianity and facing it down. This they did by selecting, among available christologies, the one that served best the interests of hostile polemic: Jesus, this christology held, was the Messiah, who ful filled the messianic promises of the Torah. Christians from Matthew for ward insisted that Jesus had kept those promises, and advanced them with great vigor as the reason for the Jews to accept Jesus as the Messiah. A fine example of the character of the Judaic response comes to us from the Barcelona disputation, 1263. The Jewish partner to the dialogue, Moses ben Nahman, tried to persuade his Christian counterpart that the Messiah was not so important to Judaism as Christians maintained. Mac coby states: If, as Christians thought, the Messiah was divine, then his coming was for every human being the central and essential moment of all history, the moment that counted for every individual's personal salvation. No wonder, then, that, for the purposes of dialogue, Judaism would meet that Christian claim head on. The condition of the world refutes Christianity, pure and simple: "From the days of Jesus until now, the whole world has been full of violence and plundering." Maccoby sums up the Christian response to this material and corpo real reading of matters: Great things wrought by the advent of the Messiah, Jesus, had all occurred not on the crude, visible, political, social level, but in the area of the spirit. In a region beyond human ken, great things had happened: hell had been harrowed. On earth, the possibility of salvation had been opened, and a great institution, the Church, had been founded to develop this possibility, and this institution had clearly been blessed by God. But, the Judaic participant points out, because of the sin of Adam and Eve, "Cursed is the ground for your sake." If the Messiah has come and remitted sin, then how is it that "all this still holds at the present day too; so that in the era of your Messiah, nothing that can actually be observed and sensed has received atonement"? The argument unfolded in the Judaic sage's insistence that "the Mes siah is not fundamental to our religion." But he further pointed out that, 10 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="9">if the Messiah has come as the Christians allege, then the evidence in the world at hand is hard to discern. Clearly, for the purposes of interfaith dialogue, the issue served well, since it permitted the two parties to meet head-on on the same issue. But to accommodate the Christian answer, one had already to stand within Christianity, since, to neutral outsiders, all the more so to partisan ones, the claim that the prophets' promises had been kept only "in the area of the spirit" formed an implausible re sponse to the misery of the human condition. Scripture promised the Messiah would bring peace, and Jesus had not done this. Beyond that assertion, all of the disputes about the meaning of verses of Scripture paled into inconsequence: the facts of the world proved the case against Christianity. That is not to say other issues did not figure in the Judaic christology—for instance, the notions of incarnation, atonement, the Trinity, original sin, and the like. But these conceptions, internal to Christianity itself, dealt with detail; if Jesus was not Christ, then what do the details matter? A considerable modern literature on Judaism and Christianity states the Judaic case for the Judaic faithful. Here, too, a variety of issues has emerged, e.g., free will vs. original sin, sin and atonement, Christian as ceticism, faith vs. law. But at the center, quite properly, stands the claim that Jesus was and is the Messiah. For my illustration of the modern for mulation of the Judaic side to the dialogue to date, I will use among nu merous candidates, Trude Weiss-Rosmarin's Judaism and Christianity: The Differences. Her final and climactic chapter addresses the figure of Jesus: "To Christians, save for an insignificantly small group of modernists, Jesus is, first of all, the Son of God and Messiah." But, of special interest here, as evidence for that formulation of matters, she cites a statement that proves asymmetrical: To us Christians . . . Jesus of Nazareth appears to be absolutely fault less, without spot or blemish, and as such to be the one perfect revelation of the character of God. What [one] could not do in any book however good, he was able to do in a living person.. When a Christian man is asked about the character of the invisible God, he points out in answer 'Jesus of Nazareth,' meaning that Jesus shows us what God really is like and loves us to do . . . Now, we see, she refers to Messiah, but discusses the idea of God in carnate, a very different thing. When I claim that the preferred Judaic christology is Christ Jesus, Messiah and savior of humanity, this some what odd and jarring juxtaposition of what is alleged to be said and what is actually said forms a striking illustration. Weiss-Rosmarin concedes SPRING 1992 11</page><page sequence="10">that "Christianity is predicated on the doctrine of incarnation," but she immediately underlines the messianic christology. But to Christians, Jesus is not only the incarnation of God but also the Messiah and Redeemer whose future advent is announced in the books of the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament is therefore to a very large extent the concerted effort to prove that Jesus was the promised Messiah and that in him all the prophets' promises were fulfilled. Judaism on the other hand maintains that Jesus was not the Messiah, for he did not fulfill the Mes sianic hopes . . . not one of the Messianic promises was fulfilled through Jesus. He neither established universal peace and social justice for all of mankind nor did he redeem Israel and raise the Lord's mountain as the top of the mountains . . . It would be difficult to find in ancient or medieval writing any more lucid or blunt statement of the preferred Judaic christology and its polemical power. Jesus is supposed to have been Christ, the Messiah. But the things the Messiah is supposed to do Jesus did not do, either in his life time or ever afterward. To Christianity, therefore, the Judaic participant in the dialogue says very simply, "It never happened; and if it did hap pen, it was a lie." Did Judaism conduct a dialogue with Christianity? In antiquity, de nying Christianity existed and at the same time deploring the moral char acter of its founder, in medieval times obligated to debate on Christian terms, in modern times finding absurd and beyond all reason one chris tology (with the other christologies still more ridiculous), Judaism never conducted a dialogue with Christianity; it never wanted to. Preferring to pretend that Christianity never made a difference anyhow, Judaism went its solitary way. So to conclude: in the dialogue between Judaism and Christianity sur face chatter covers over profound mutual incomprehension. If I may summarize, however, the prevailing theory of the dialogue, it is in two parts. First of all, because both religions appeal to the same scriptures, "the Old Testament," "the written Torah," we may speak of a Judaeo Christian tradition. If there is a shared tradition, then surely there can and should be honest dialogue about it. Second, since Jesus was a Jew, in order to understand Christianity, Christians must come to terms with Judaism. Important schools of New Testament studies, aiming to iden tify those sayings of Jesus that really were said by him, have excluded the sayings that they deem unjudaic, for example, and still more important circles of New Testament scholarship appeal to Judaic sources as a prin cipal source of hermeneutics. One theological position then distin guishes between the Jesus of history, who was born, lived, and died as 12 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="11">a Jew, and the Christ of theology. The connection to the dialogue be tween Judaism and Christianity is then simple. The two religions can speak with one another because Christianity de rives from Judaism through the person of Jesus, a historical figure. If, then, we wish to understand Christianity, we peel back the layers of "in authentic" theology and reach back into the core and heart, the Judaism of Jesus then forming authentic Christianity. True, that Judaism then may be represented in such a way as to reject the rest of the Judaism of that time or place; Jesus vastly reformed what there was; Christianity then is what Judaism ought to have become. For Christians who do not begin with belief in the supernatural Christ, the Incarnate God, an easy faith flows from the notion that Judaism was corrupt and Jesus cleaned it up; then Christianity is to be preferred to the inferior Brand X. That apologetic yields a caricature of the Jews and of Judaism, as we shall see. The upshot is a dialogue with Judaism that yields an apologetic for Chris tianity and a condemnation of Judaism as we know it—not much better than the medieval disputations produced, hardly a model of a genuine interchange of religions attempting to take one another seriously. Nor has Judaism contributed a more suitable example of how to take seriously another religion in terms of one's own religion. If there is no Christian theology of Judaism, at least some have made the effort, build ing, for instance, on Paul in Romans 9. But apart from a feeble effort of Rosenzweig to postulate a dual covenant—Christianity for the gentiles, Judaism for holy Israel—no Judaic theology of Christianity has founded a theological tradition of breadth and weight. The "two-covenant the ory" well serves the interests of the social order: "yours is good for you, ours is good for us, so let's live in peace." But no serious theological so lution consists in denying now what we, on both sides, have affirmed for so long; we Jews never believed Christianity was a true religion, forming a path to God, for, if we did, we should not accept gentile converts to Judaism; and Christians cannot believe Judaism forms a valid covenant and at the same time accept Judaic converts to Christianity. The disin genuousness of the Judaic affirmation of the dual covenant is matched by the incredibility of the Christian: after all this time, it was really all about nothing. There has been no dialogue. I do think there can, and even should, be one; but that is another story. 2. But There Can Be a Judaeo-Christian Dialogue The Judaeo-Christian dialogue has foundered because each side finds it difficult to address the most deeply held convictions of the other: Ju SPRING1992 13</page><page sequence="12">daism cannot cope with the conception of God Incarnate in a human be ing; Christianity finds difficult the conception of the uniqueness and ho liness of Israel. For the Judaic faithful, Jesus Christ, God Incarnate, utterly unique, and for the Christian faithful, Israel, God's people, ut terly unique, present convictions that are exceedingly difficult to grasp. In the disputations of the Middle Ages the Judaic side found little dif ficulty in dismissing, to its own satisfaction, the notion that a man can be God. The Christian side, for its part, had only to look at the humiliated condition of the Jews to find ample evidence for the notion that the Church had superseded Israel. And in modern times the Judaic side has done all it could to avoid dealing with the christology of God Incarnate, so as not to have to abort the dialogue at the outset. Mainstream Prot estant and Roman Catholic hostility to the State of Israel after 1948, like the violent opposition to Zionism before then, suggests that, as the de struction of the Jews' temple and state in 70 had for Chrysostom or Eu sebius attested to the sin of Israel and the truth of Christ, so Zionism and the creation of the State of Israel in modern times form a puzzle to the faithful Christian. To put matters bluntly, neither side has wanted to say what both sides have had in mind—"What absurdities!" For both parties dialogue has proceeded around the edges of faith, rather than at the center of what truly matters to the other party in the dialogue: "Israel" to Judaism, Christ Jesus the incarnation of God to much of Christianity. That accounts for the dissimulation and incompre hension that characterize efforts at concrete dialogue. So, these days, when the Judaic party to the dialogue raises the question of Christian hostility to the State of Israel, the Christian party resists with the obser vation that these are, after all, political, not religious or theological ques tions; when the Christian party accedes to talk of the human excellence of Jesus, hearing extravagant praise for what is, to Christianity, of only subordinate concern, both the Judaic faithful with its lavish praise of the man Jesus, and the Christian party with its patient effort to accept the praise at face value, carry forward the tradition of dissimulation, not to say hypocrisy, that has masked the denial of dialogue for so very long. In such circumstances, it goes without saying, the Judaic allegation, from the early part of this century, of two covenants, one for Israel, the other for the rest of the world (with no special status accorded to Christianity in relationship to Israel), and the Christian allegation, from the decades beyond the confrontation with the Holocaust, of two covenants, one for all humanity, the other for Israel, is simply premature. How are theo 14 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="13">logical propositions and affirmations to attain a genuine hearing by peo ple each deaf to the other's deepest concerns? How do I propose to proceed from this ground zero that I claim forms our common location? Let me begin the work of defining a new foun dation for dialogue by making one point only: the only way for a Judaic believer to understand Christianity is within Judaic terms, and the only way for a Christian believer to understand Judaism is within Christian terms. The same point can be stated negatively. If, out of the resources of Judaism, I cannot take Christianity so seriously as to wish to conduct a dialogue, then I cannot honestly claim to argue, to enter into honest exchange. If to conduct a dialogue with Judaism in particular, Christi anity has to deny what it has claimed for two thousand years, then the Christian party condescends or dissimulates. And, it goes without say ing, if out of shame for the Christian contribution to the Holocaust (and all the holocausts before this one), Christianity denies its own long-held truth, then what good can come of dialogue? And how, out in the par ishes, will priests and ministers explain to the people that what they have long believed about Judaism is really wrong, and so is the Christian faith that sustained these beliefs about the other? Since Judaism and Christianity form quite different religions with little in common, it is time for each religion to try to make sense of the other— but to make sense of the stranger wholly in one's own terms. Can I, as a Jew and a believer in Judaism, understand in my context, in my terms of faith, the religion of the Christian? Can I frame a Judaic religious un derstanding of the religion of Christianity? What it means to understand another religion demands a definition. Up to now, as I already have noted, some rather unsuccessful efforts at theologies, each of the other, have shown us what not to attempt: a Christian theology of Judaism proves, if not condescending, then un-Christian, conceding more than Christianity has ever conceded in the past, and a Judaic theology of Christianity gives no less—and no more authentically. Judaism cannot concede that Jesus Christ is what the Christians say, and any other judg ment upon Jesus Christ is simply beside the point. Christianity may con cede that we retain our covenanted relationship with God, but it cannot then admit that converts to Judaism have taken the right route to salva tion. So all that Christianity concedes is that Judaism is all right for the Jews, a concession to be sure, but not of vast consequence. But if not a theological understanding of one another, then what other understand ing can we seek? SPRING 1992 15</page><page sequence="14">My answer commences with a necessary recognition: the common place fact that, after all, we Jews and Christians really do worship one God, who is the same God, and who is the only God—we and the Mus lims with us. So dialogue is required among the three faiths that claim to worship one and the same God, the only God. Within that common ground of being, a human task emerges before us. It is to seek in the re ligious experience of the other—the stranger and outsider—that with which we, within our own world, can identify. I cannot ask the Christian to deny Jesus Christ as Incarnate God, nor can I ask myself to believe that Jesus Christ was and is God Incarnate. But I must try to understand the incarnation of God: precisely what is the other side saying? If I am able to locate, in my religious resources, something that will help me to grasp what, within the other's religious resources, the other party is saying, then the other, while remaining other and different, no longer stands be yond the range of understanding. To begin with, can I sympathize, that is, feel how the other feels, the other remaining other? The answer is, yes I can, if I find in my own world analogies that permit me in some measure to feel and so understand what the other feels and affirms in the world of that other. The critical challenge as the two extraordinarily complex and diverse religions seek to communicate begins not with the negoti ation of theological difference, not with its intellectual tasks, but with the pathos of alien feeling: can I, in my life, feel what the other feels in the other's life? In simple words, when I can say, "Yes, I know how you feel," when I begin to be able to enter into the realm of feeling, I may then enter the realm of attitude and may move from there to the realm of thought. But so long as I do not know how the other feels, I will listen in sheer in credulity to the other's attitudes and thoughts. And while diverse cul tures nurture different attitudes, and various religions nurture different theologies, joy or sorrow or love or hope or despair are another matter— with these feelings, and the experiences that provoke them, God has en dowed us all. When I know how the other feels because I have felt the same way, then I may talk with the other, even about other things. What moves me, as distinct from what persuades me, is the story the other person tells. I can identify with someone in the story, or the story teller; then, in the present context, I can find among my stories a story that matches the story of the other. To take a homely example, when I read, particularly in the Gospel of John, how Jesus tries to prepare his disciples for the lives that they are going to lead, how he warns them but also strengthens them, I found it easy, as a person who has undertaken 16 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="15">to educate young people to change the world, to identify with Jesus, his message, his disciples, and their situation. Here was no doctrine, only an implicit story, and how readily did that story make sense to me, not be cause it was my story (I never sent out my students as apostles), but be cause in my story I could find resonance in his story: the pain, the an guish. Why the medium of a story, my story, to help me understand a story, the other's story? First, because stories touch the heart; they are immediate, direct, unmediated. Second, because stories that touch the heart elicit sympathy; I can feel for the other, reach out beyond myself. This brings me to the search for a story, out of the canon of Judaism, that permits me to grasp, within Judaism, what the Christian other means by God Incarnate. A subdivision of anthropomorphism, the in carnation of God in general entails the representation of God as consub stantial with the human person in, first, corporeal form, second, traits of emotions and other virtues, and, third, action. God is represented in in carnate form when God looks like a human being (ordinarily, in the case of a Judaism, a man), exhibits virtues and expresses emotions like those of mortals, and does concrete deeds in a corporeal manner, pretty much as do human beings. The representation of God as incarnate will not have surprised the authors of a variety of Judaic documents, beginning with the compilers of the Pentateuch, starting with Gen. 1:9: "Let us make man in our image and likeness." Explicitly and in subtle allusions, prophets and apocalyptic writers, exegetes and sages, mystics and leg ists, all maintained that notion. Here is how Gen. 1:9 is read so as to give explicit notion to the con ception of the incarnation of God: 1. A. Said R. Hoshaiah, "When the Holy One, blessed be he, came to cre ate the first man, the ministering angels mistook him [for God, since man was in God's image,] and wanted to say before him, 'Holy, [holy, holy is the Lord of hosts].' B. "To what may the matter be compared? To the case of a king and a governor who were set in a chariot, and the provincials wanted to greet the king, "Sovereign!" But they did not know which one of them was which. What did the king do? He turned the governor out and put him away from the chariot, so that people would know who was king. C. "So too when the Holy One, blessed be he, created the first man, the angels mistook him [for God], What did the Holy One, blessed be he, do? He put him to sleep, so everyone knew that he was a mere man. D. "That is in line with the following verse of Scripture: 'Cease you from man, in whose nostrils is a breath, for how little is he to be accounted' (Is. 2:22)." (Genesis Rabbah VIII:X) SPRING 1992 17</page><page sequence="16">In light of this reading of Gen. 1:9, we may hardly find surprising the power of diverse heirs of Scripture, framers of various Judaic religious systems, to present portraits of the incarnation of God—corporeal, in af fects and virtues consubstantial with humanity, doing things human be ings do in the ways in which they do them. As a matter of fact, at the final stage in the formation of the canon of the Judaism of the dual Torah, the incarnation of God forms a principal aspect of the character of divinity. Prior to that time, the character of di vinity extended to portraits of God as 1) premise, e.g., the one who cre ated the world and gave the Torah; 2) presence, e.g., supernatural being resident in the Temple and present where two or more persons engaged in discourse concerning the Torah; and 3) person, e.g., the one to whom prayer is addressed. But at the end we find important allusions to the incarnation of God as well as narratives that realize that incarnation in concrete terms. What is important to us is that when God is incarnate for Judaism, that knowledge of God reaches us through stories about what God is and does. When I pointed to sharing our stories with one another as a means of gaining sympathy for what is alien about one another, I had in mind talmudic stories about the incarnate God. These we Jews tell ourselves. When we hear Christians' stories, we hear stories not our own; but we can recollect our stories and respond to them in ways that accord with Christians' responses to their stories: a different kind of di alogue, but one that I think is plausible. How then is the incarnate God represented by the oral Torah? This story treats the incarnation of God: A. Said R. Judah said Rab, "When Moses went up to the height, he found the Holy One, blessed be he, sitting and tying crowns to the letters [of the Torah]. B. "He said to him 'Lord of the universe, why is this necessary?' C. "He said to him, 'There is a certain man who is going to come into being at the end of some generations, by the name of Aqiba b. Joseph. He is going to find expositions to attach mounds and mounds of laws to each point [of a crown].' D. "He said to him, 'Lord of the universe, show him to me.' E. "He said to him, 'Turn around.' F. "[Moses] went and took his seat at the end of eight rows, but he could not understand what the people were saying. He felt weak. When discourse came to a certain matter, one of [Aqiba's] disciples said to him, 'My lord, how do you know this?' G. "He said to him, 'It is a law revealed by God to Moses at Mount Sinai.' H. "Moses' spirits were restored. 18 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="17">I. "He turned back and returned to the Holy One, blessed be he. He said to him, 'Lord of the universe, now if you have such a man available, how can you give the Torah through me?' J. "He said to him, 'Be silent. That is how I have decided matters.' K. "He said to him, 'Lord of the universe, you have now shown me his mastery of the Torah. Now show me his reward.' L. "He said to him, 'Turn around.' M. "He turned around and saw people weighing out his flesh in the butcher-shop. N. "He said to him, 'Lord of the universe, such is his mastery of Torah, and such is his reward?' O. "He said to him, 'Be silent. That is how I have decided matters.' " (B. Men. 296) The story is open-ended: "Be silent. That is how I have decided matters." That statement hardly marks a happy ending, and it assuredly does not answer the question with which the passage commences. The story merely restates the question in a more profound way. In this story the sage is like God, but, like all other human beings, subject to God's ul timate decree. This I take to be the final statement of the incarnation of God of the Judaism of the dual Torah. God incarnate remains God in effable. When the Judaism of the dual Torah wishes to portray the char acter of divinity, it invokes in the end the matter of relationship and not tactile quality and character. If we wish to know God, it is through our relationship to God, not through our (entirely legitimate and welcome) act of the incarnation of God in heart and mind and soul, deliberation and deed. And the way to engage with, relate to, God, in the face of (in the suggestive instance at hand) the Torah and torture of Aqiba, is si lence. So, for the faithful Jew, is the conception of God incarnate beyond all reason? ridiculous? absurd? Not at all. When I tell my stories, in which I learn how the Torah reveals God, both the stories of the prophets and what God said to them, and the stories of our sages of blessed memory and how they knew God in incarnate form, I can understand how some one else may tell stories about how God is like us, and about how we can become like God. Can I then listen with sympathy to the Christian story of Jesus Christ, God Incarnate? Without doubt. I can listen with sympa thy, because the Torah teaches me how. Do I have to listen to such sto ries? If I want to know how to understand my stories better, if I want to think deeply about what it means for us to be like God and about what it means for humanity to incarnate God—for "to incarnate" is a transitive verb—then, to open my heart and soul to all the ways people can imagine SPRING 1992 19</page><page sequence="18">God incarnate, I do. That is, in order to know what it means to be human "like God," I do well to listen to the stories other people tell, too, about what it means to be "in our image, after our likeness," as their hearts and minds have told the story to them. If the Incarnation of God in Jesus Christ is critical to Christianity, the word "Israel" is critical to Judaism. It is exceedingly difficult for outsiders to grasp, a mark of its importance within. When Christians hear the word "Israel," they think first of the State of Israel, then of the people of Israel in biblical times. Identifying with ancient Israel through the Old Testa ment, Christians inherit another conception of Israel as well, one that makes a sympathetic response to the State of Israel parlous. It is the no tion that the destruction of the Temple and the end of the Jewish state in 70 punished Israel "after the flesh," and until the Jews today repent and accept Christ, they should have no state. The creation of the State of Israel in 1948, in the aftermath of the murder of most of the Jews in Christian Europe, called in question a long-held conviction; the State fur ther formed an embarrassment to Christian Arabs, on the one side, and to Christian missions and institutions in Muslim countries, on the other. When, therefore, Judaic participants in the Judaeo-Christian dialogue raise the question of Christian hostility to the State of Israel, the Christian partners find very difficult the intrusion of a political question into a re ligious dialogue; what, after all, can be "religious" about a secular state? And that objection underlines yet another ongoing Christian difficulty in making sense of the Jews, which is the Jews' intense sense of "being Jew ish," whether or not a professed religious conviction about "being holy Israel" infuses their "being Jewish" with religious content. The fusion of the ethnic, the religious, the cultural, and the political, woefully confuses Christians. But there is no dialogue with Israel, the Jewish people, with out a clear, Christian understanding of what, in Judaism, "Israel" stands for, and why, for nearly all Jews, there is no sorting out the religious, ethnic, and cultural categories—not to mention, after all, the genealog ical as well. The given of Jewish existence, "Israel" in all its dimensions— involving the State, the land, the people there and everywhere—stands as an obstacle to dialogue for Christians. Not a Christian, I can hardly be expected to explain for Christians, out of the resources of Christianity, the Judaic theory of Israel. What I can attempt is to explain to Christians in Judaic terms what "Israel" stands for, in the hope that Christians may find sympathy for our "Israel" by appeal to three profoundly Christian concepts. These, then, must be specified to begin with. First comes the theory that from the fall of Adam, 20 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="19">humanity arose from the dregs of sin through Christ. In Romans 1-3, Paul explains how no human being escapes the domination of sin. The human condition is defined by the first sin, Adam's and Eve's, so sin is natural to the human condition. In Corinthians, Paul contrasts the first Adam, source of death, to Christ, the second Adam, source of life: For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ, shall all be made alive. But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ (1 Corinthians 15:21-22). ... the first man Adam became a living being, the last Adam became a life-giving spirit (15:45). The first man was from the earth, a man of dust, the second man is from heaven; as was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven. Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven" (15:49). In the Judaism of the dual Torah, "Israel" serves precisely in the same way, that is, marking the rise of humanity from the fall of Adam to the pinnacle—of Sinai. The second and third points come together. On the one side, as He brews says in so many words, this atonement for sin was achieved through Christ's suffering. And, on the other side, Christ stands for the suffering servant of Isaiah: He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shear ers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his gener ation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people? (Is. 54:7-8) Christians will not find Judaism's—and the Jews'—conception of "Israel" so absurd, if, in sympathy, they can understand a simple fact. There is scarcely a Jew in the world who reads these words without understand ing, beyond all doubt, that when Isaiah spoke, he told us about the Ho locaust. Do I mean, then, to suggest that Christianity now contemplate sub stituting "Israel" for "Christ"? Of course not, any more than I should want Judaism to make sense of nonsense and therefore consider Jesus Christ God Incarnate to stand for what God meant when God spoke of us "in our image, after our likeness." Just as I seek in the resources of Judaism to find foundations for sympathy for a profoundly alien concep tion of the other, so I hope that, out of the resources of Christianity—not SPRING 1992 21</page><page sequence="20">merely out of sentimentality or a sense of shame or (misplaced) guilt for the Christian contribution to the murder of Jewry in Christendom Christians may make some sense of what they see as the Judaic nonsense about this "Israel." For, in the theory of "Israel" put forward by Judaism, we shall now see, our "Israel" serves like the Christian Christ: the antidote to Adam: 2. "And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day" (Gen. 3:8): Said R. Abba bar Kahana, "The word is not written, 'move,' but rather, 'walk,' bearing the sense that [the Presence of God] leapt about and jumped upward. B. "[The point is that God's presence leapt upward from the earth on account of the events in the garden, as will now be explained:] The prin cipal location of the Presence of God was [meant to be] among the creatures down here. When the first man sinned, the Presence of God moved up to the first firmament. When Cain sinned, it went up to the second firma ment. When the generation of Enoch sinned, it went up to the third fir mament. When the generation of the Flood sinned, it went up to the fourth firmament. When the generation of the dispersion [at the tower of Babel] sinned, it went up to the fifth. On account of the Sodomite it went up to the sixth, and on account of the Egyptians in the time of Abraham it went up to the seventh. C. "But, as a counterpart, there were seven righteous men who rose up: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kahath, Amram, and Moses. They brought the Presence of God [by stages] down to earth. D. "Abraham brought it from the seventh to the sixth, Isaac brought it from the sixth to the fifth, Jacob brought it from the fifth to the fourth, Levi brought it down from the forth to the third, Kahath brought it down from the third to the second, Amram brought it down from the second to the first. Moses brought it down to earth." (Genesis Rabbah to Genesis 3:1-13. XIX:VII.) God left the world with Adam's sin; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and onward to Moses at Sinai, brought God back to the world. More to the point, as we shall now see, the life of Israel in the Land of Israel forms a coun terpoint and opposite to the life of Adam in the Garden of Eden. Israel is the successor to Adam, what God brought about in opposition to Adam: 2. A. R. Abbahu in the name of R. Yose bar Hariinah: "It is written, 'But they are like a man [Adam], they have transgressed the covenant' (Hos. 6:7). B. " 'They are like a man,' specifically, like the first man. [We shall now compare the story of the first man in Eden with the story of Israel in its land.] 22 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="21">C. " 'In the case of the first man, I brought him into the garden of Eden, I commanded him, he violated my commandment, I judged him to be sent away and driven out, but I mourned for him, saying "How . . " [which begins the book of Lamentations, hence stands for a lament, but which, as we just saw, also is written with the consonants that also yield, 'Where are you?].' D. " Ί brought him into the garden of Eden,' as it is written, 'And the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden' (Gen. 2:15). Ε. " Ί commanded him,' as it is written, 'And the Lord God com manded . . . ' (Gen. 2:16). F. " 'And he violated my commandment,' as it is written, 'Did you eat from the tree concerning which I commanded you?' (Gen. 3:11). G. " Ί judged him to be sent away,' as it is written, "And the Lord God sent him from the garden of Eden' (Gen. 3:23). H. " 'And I judged him to be driven out.' 'And he drove out the man' (Gen. 3:24). I. " 'But I mourned for him, saying, "How . . . ".' 'And he said to him, "Where are you" ' (Gen. 3:9), and the word for 'where are you' is written, 'How J. " 'So too in the case of his descendants [God continues to speak], I brought them into the Land of Israel, I commanded them, they violated my commandment, I judged them to be sent out and driven away but I mourned for them, saying, "How . . . ' " Κ. " Ί brought them into the Land of Israel.' 'And I brought you into the land of Carmel' (Jer. 2:7). L. " Ί commanded them.' 'And you, command the children of Israel' (Ex. 27:20). 'Command the children of Israel' (Lev. 24:2). M. " 'They violated my commandment.' 'And all Israel have violated your Torah' (Dan. 9:11). Ν. " Ί judged them to be sent out.' 'Send them away, out of my sight and let them go forth' (Jer 15:1). O. " '. . . and driven away.' 'From my house I shall drive them' (Hos. 9:15). P. " 'But I mourned for them, saying, "How . . . ' " 'How has the city sat solitary, that was full of people' (Lam. 1:1)." (Genesis Rabbah to Gen. 3:8. XIX:IX) I find deeply moving the comparison of the story of man in the Garden of Eden with the tale of Israel in its Land. Every detail is in place, the articulation is perfect, and the result completely convinces as an essay in interpretation. All of this rests on the simple fact that the word for "where are you" may be expressed as "How ..." which, as is clear, in vokes the opening words of the book of Lamentations. What is important to us is the representation of Israel: Israel's history serves as a paradigm for human history, and vice-versa. Then Israel stands at the center of hu SPRING1992 23</page><page sequence="22">manity. And in this context, "Israel" forms a theological category, as does "Christ" for Paul. The scandal to the Jews—God Incarnate? indeed!—is now joined by the stumbling block to the other side—Israel? indeed! What is critical to the one side finds its counterpart in what is critical to the other, and, we now realize, we have found our way to the heart of the matter of whether dialogue is at all possible, I mean, a dialogue formed by an exchange of stories. Now I do not know which story, within Christianity, will elicit sym pathy for what "Israel" means to me. The correspondence of Christian ity's Christ, or mystical body of Christ, or church, to Judaism's Israel sug gests why, for so long, Christianity has found incomprehensible Judaism's understanding of Israel. By claiming that "Israel" constituted "Israel after the flesh"—the actual, living present family of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob and Leah and Rachel—sages met head-on the Christian claim that there was some other "Israel," of a lin eage not defined by the family connection at all, and that the existing Jews no longer constituted "Israel." By representing "Israel" as sui gen eris, sages moreover focused upon systemic teleology, with its definition of salvation, in response to the Christian claim that salvation is not of Israel but of the church, now enthroned in this world as in heaven. The sage—model for Israel, in the model of Moses our rabbi—on earth rep resented the Torah that had come from heaven. Like Christ, on earth as in heaven, like the church, the body of Christ, the ruler of earth (through the emperor) as of heaven, the sage embodied what Israel was and was to be. So Israel as family in the model of the sage, like Moses our rabbi, corresponded in its social definition to the church of Jesus Christ, the New Israel, the source of salvation and the savior of humanity. Why do I think Christians should address this issue of "Israel"? Ob viously, for the same reason that Christians themselves have asked about a dialogue with Judaism. In the aftermath of the Holocaust, Christians examined Christianity's doctrine of Israel, the Jews, and Judaism. Not responsible for the National Socialists—themselves anti-Christian— Christianity has come to recognize that Christians were National Social ists. While not the source of racist antisemitism, Christianity made its massive contribution to the racist antisemitism that shaped the policy of mass murder of men, women, and children, in the name of the "puri fication" of humanity; and Christianity has come to recognize that theirs has been a teaching of contempt. But, prepared to enter into dialogue with Judaism, Christians have found the State of Israel an obstacle, and, 24 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="23">I believe I have shown, have done so for quite profound theological rea sons. First of all, though long experienced in governing, with a long his tory of a politically empowered church and preference for Christian states, Christianity finds the notion of a Jewish state somehow egregious; religions do not have, or form, states (except, of course, when they do), so what can be so Judaic about the State of Israel that Christianity, in ad dressing Judaism, should have simultaneously to take notice of the State of Israel? Second, the advent of the State of Israel really did call into ques tion the theological convictions of many centuries. And, third, when we speak of "Israel," Judaic and Christian faithful really cannot concur that they speak of one and the same thing. So much for the question. Can there be an answer? To me, the words of Isaiah speak of us: He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shear ers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. To me, Isaiah describes my life and the life of my people: it is with me when I wake up in the morning and when I go to sleep at night. Can Christians tell our story in their way, so that they may find sympathy for us? Clearly, they can, and many do. That is why I do not doubt that Christians can find in the story of Christ resources for telling themselves, also, the story of Israel in our times. And in reading the suffering servant as we do, they discover the resources for not assenting to but sympa thetically hearing our conviction that we are Israel, after the flesh and after the spirit alike. Then, but only then can dialogue with Judaism as it is, with us as we are, commence. We do our best with the Incarnate God. Now I hope Christians for their part may try to do their best with Israel—and no quotation marks this time. SPRING 1992 25</page></plain_text>
