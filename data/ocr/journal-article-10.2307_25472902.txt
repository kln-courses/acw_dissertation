This is sometimes as much the result of omission as commission; witness E. P. Thompson's apologetic remarks in the preface to The Making of the English Working Class that, despite the fact that the 'Scottish Jacobin agitation' was arguably '[even] more intense and more History Workshop Journal Issue 63 doi:10.1093/hwj/dbm012 ?

W. Meikle's Scotland and the French Revolution, which, for all its considerable merits, was published in 1912.3 To isolate Scottish radicalism from the broader British and international scene is to misrepresent its nature. There's no doubt, for example, that the Scottish Society of the Friends of the People took the initiative in calling the first British Convention in Edinburgh in December 1792,4 and as John Barrell has recently shown, the Edinburgh Sedition Trials of 1793, as well as the trials of Watt and Downie held in the Scottish capital the following year, were defining moments in the radicals' shift from petitioning parliament to a more strident conventionalism on the French model. These events were also crucial, Barrell argues, to the evolution of the Crown's definition of 'constructive treason'.5 Nevertheless, the Scottish movement tends to be viewed as merely a prelude to the narrative of a more robust English radicalism, the (brief) consummation of which was the acquittal of Hardy, Tooke, Thelwall and others in the 1794 London Treason Trials. Or else, across the waters, the fainter light of Scottish radicalism is utterly eclipsed by the revolutionary blaze of the United Irishmen and the sanguinary outcome of the rebellion of '98, which bore more resemblance to contemporary events in France and continental Europe.6 In Scotland, an obsession with gauging the historical 'success' or 'failure' of the radical movement has hardly contributed to stimulate fresh thinking. If for nationalists 'failure' is yet another instance of the imposition of the English jackboot, the verdict of mainstream historians tends to be faintly apologetic, even embarrassed, as if the events of the revolutionary decade somehow jeopardized the 'mature' political achievements of the Scottish Enlightenment, or the 'respectable' parliamentary reform movement of the nineteenth century.7 When John Brims (in the most detailed recent study of the Scottish Friends of the People) writes that 'the mad proceedings of the British Convention ensured the destruction of the Scottish parliamentary reform movement', he alludes to its adoption of the forms and maxims of the regicidal French Convention.8 For some of the more cautious delegates, not to mention the Crown prosecutors, this imitation of French protocol did indeed appear to be something worse than folly, rather, a hostage to fortune. Nevertheless, as Elaine McFarland has argued, it was also symptomatic of a new spirit of cosmopolitanism which transformed Scottish and British radical politics in the late eighteenth century. The revisionist challenge facing historians, as she sees it, is to restore this internationalist dimension to the Scottish movement, not only in relation to Ireland (her own valuable contribution) but also to Europe and the wider world.9 The present essay offers itself as another contribution to that project, albeit one concerned less with mapping historical events and affiliations</page><page sequence="3">50 History Workshop Journal than with the manipulation of the textual media of political debate in (what remained of) the eighteenth-century public sphere. Focusing on the charismatic figure of Thomas Muir of Huntershill, the leading light of Scottish radicalism in the 1790s, the first part of my essay examines the discourse of Muir's trial and his transportation for sedition in 1793, briefly surveying the astonishing events of his subsequent escape from Botany Bay and return via Mexico and Cuba to revolutionary France in 1797. I argue that Muir skilfully converted antipodean banishment into an opportunity for globalizing the principles of revolution. This is somewhat ironic given that Muir's agitation for parliamentary reform in the early 1790s was tinged by a Scottish and Irish patriotism (and opposition to the Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707) not generally shared by his fellow Scottish radicals who, after his arrest, were happy to join forces with English associations to form the significantly-named 'British Convention'. The destruction of Muir and the fledgling Friends of the People may well have been a triumph for the Scottish Tories, but, as Henry Cockburn recalled, they nonetheless continued to be haunted by the spectre of Muir's democratic cosmopolitanism, even after he had been banished to another hemisphere.10 I'll demonstrate this with reference to an eight-page poem in heroic couplets entitled The Telegraph, a consolatory epistle from Thomas Muir, Esq., of Botany Bay, to the Hon. Henry Erskine, published in January 1796, one of several anti-jacobin pamphlets and satires which sought to conflate the politics of the moderate Scottish Whigs with the defeated Friends of the People. I'll suggest that this otherwise unremarkable poem imagines the threat in terms of the new French information technology of telegraphy, itself symptomatic of the transnational reach and rapidity of radical publicity. In a study of changing paradigms of political protest in the late eighteenth century, Stana Nenadic has argued that 'middle class [reformers] emphasised the use of knowledge, printed information and statistical data in the formation of rationally argued and published calls for change in the name of progress'.11 By employing (albeit with some hesitation) Friedrich Kittler's term 'discourse network' in this context I'll propose, with reference to The Telegraph, that not merely 'political information', but also the new forms of media and information technology by which it could be disseminated over local, national and international boundaries, had become the objects equally of radical optimism and conservative anxiety.12 MUIR'S BRAZILIAN INSCRIPTION In 1802 Captain James Tuckey, a British naval officer visiting Rio De Janeiro en route to establish a new British penal colony in New South Wales, paid a visit to the library of the Antonine monks in the Brazilian capital. He was shown an English book, The Memoirs of Thomas Hollis, which, he was told, had been presented to the monks some years before</page><page sequence="4">Thomas Muir and 'The Telegraph' 51 by a Scottish political prisoner.13 In his Account of a Voyage to Establish a Colony at Port Philip ...in N. S. Wales published in 1805, Tuckey recorded a Latin inscription written in a blank leaf of the book: 'Thomas Muir de Hunters Hill/Gente Scotus, Anima Orbis terrarum Civis Obtulit' (Thomas Muir of Hunters' Hill/By birth a Scot, in Spirit a Citizen of the World, has made this gift). The inscription continued with a patriotic poem lamenting the condition of the writer's native land: (I translate) O Scotland! O my country for long blessed and proud above others, most holy land of heroes rich in resources, fecund in population, most fortunate in its rich plains! Who could ever relate your inflictions, and the extent of your troubles, and find words to evoke your sorrows, ignominy and your barbarous laws? Oddly, Tuckey's original transcription mistakenly rendered the Latin noun 'Scotia' as 'Scholia', thereby converting Muir's poem into a lament for the fate of an allegorical homeland, namely 'scholarship' or (in the language of the day) 'the republic of letters', rather than 'Scotland'. In its April 1805 review of Tuckey's book, The Gentleman's Magazine commented on 'the false Latin which our copyist has made in several instances' and restored 'Scotia' for 'Scholia'.14 There is after all a certain justice in Tuckey's erroneous transliteration, because Muir's lament for Scotland was also a lament for the fate of the republic of letters in the repressive political climate of the mid 1790s. But the Gentleman's Magazine's correction of 'Scholia' to 'Scotia' is extremely important in assessing Muir's own political identity. Muir had inscribed these stirring words eight years earlier in July 1794,when he had visited Rio en route for the penal colony at Botany Bay on board HM Transport ship Surprize. As one of the leaders of the Scottish Reform movement he became the first and most celebrated of the 'Scottish Martyrs' when, in August 1793, he was found guilty of sedition and given the draconian sentence of fourteen years' transportation. Henry Cockburn later wrote in his Trials for Sedition, '[Muir's] is one of the cases, the memory whereof never perisheth. History cannot let its injustice alone'.15 A founder member of the Scottish Society of the Friends of the People, Muir was a lawyer, educated at Glasgow and Edinburgh Universities (his mentor Professor John Millar of Glasgow remained a close friend and correspon dent throughout Muir's short life). As an elder of the Presbyterian Kirk at Cadder, on the outskirts of Glasgow, adjacent to his father's small estate of Huntershill, Muir was a supporter of the Popular or 'High Flyer' party of the Kirk, actively opposing the Moderate clergy's platform of aristocratic patronage. On board the Surprize he argued amicably with his fellow transportee, the Cambridge Unitarian Thomas Fysshe Palmer, in defence of Trinitarian theology.</page><page sequence="5">52 History Workshop Journal Muir's Trinitarian and Calvinist theology didn't conflict with his radical politics, or for that matter with his endorsement of the United Irishmen's demand for Catholic emancipation. Nevertheless, the book in which his Brazilian inscription was written, Hollis's Memoirs (1780), was a work of 'Real Whig' and anti-catholic propaganda which hardly concealed the republican enthusiasm of its author: one of its plates represented a bust of Milton with a regicidal axe leaning against its plinth, another showed Hollis's head surmounting a motif of Phrygian caps and unsheathed republican daggers. As Colin Bonwick notes, 'Hollis's principal contribution to public service was the protection and advancement of English liberty by circulating appropriate books on government... initially the tracts were directed towards libraries throughout Britain and continental Europe, later, he turned his generosity to America'.16 In this light, Muir's gift to the Brazilian monks itself embodied a 'practice of enlightenment' inspired by Hollis and his ilk, and which I want to argue typified radical publicity throughout the 1790s. Reformers like Muir programmatically transformed official proscription and political 'failure' into so many opportunities for the dissemination of radical ideology.17 PATRIOTS VERSUS UNIONISTS Muir was unusual amongst the Scottish Friends of the People in combining a programme of constitutional reform deriving from English reformers like Jebb, the Hollises and Cartwright with a particularly Scottish form of the 'ancient constitution' argument, deriving ultimately from the republican principles of the Reformation humanist George Buchanan.18 As Colin Kidd has shown, the rather battered eighteenth-century vestiges of this 'Buchananite' tradition interpreted the 1707 Act of Union between England and Scotland as a continuation of the Norman Yoke, which had crushed the primitive liberties of both Anglo-Saxon and Celtic Britain.19 One of the principal indictments against Muir for sedition was that he'd read out an address from the United Irishmen to their Scottish brethren at the first Convention of the Friends of the People in Edinburgh on 11-13 December 1792. This document, stretching to 'almost 3000 words of florid prose',20 was penned by the radical Ulster poet Dr William Drennan, but carefully couched its appeal in the language of Scottish patriotism; 'you do not consider yourselves as merged and melted down into another country, but that in this great national question you are still Scotland - the land where Buchanan wrote, and Fletcher spoke, and Wallace fought'.21 The majority of the Scottish delegates, however, eager to affiliate with the English Reform Societies to establish a consolidated 'British Convention', considered that the Address contained 'high treason against the Union betwixt England and Scotland'. After two days of bitter dispute, it was voted down.22 In so doing, to quote Brims, the Scottish Friends</page><page sequence="6">Thomas Muir and 'The Telegraph' 53 'rejected both an alliance with the United Irishmen and the republican nationalism to which the Irish appealed' and, we might add, which Muir had strongly endorsed.23 This wasn't a matter of political faintheartedness, however: Robert Fowler, who vehemently opposed the Irish Address, was also the delegate responsible for proposing a successful motion that the Convention should take the French oath 'To live free or die'. This, as we've seen, would invite accusations of treason by identifying political reform with the protocols of the regicide French Convention.24 Muir's political memorandum written in the final year of his life in Paris in 1797-8 reveals a rather crazy anglophobia, doubtless in part based on resentment at the treatment he had suffered at the hands (not to mention the shrapnel) of the British state, but also motivated by his bid to attract funding from the French Directory as self-appointed leader of both Scottish and Irish revolutionary movements. 'The English are the most ignorant and barbarous people in Europe', he wrote, 'illiterate, characterless weathercocks... their king 'a greater hypocrite than Tiberius.'25 As McFarland has shown, a younger and more lucid Muir was strongly influenced by the nationalist sentiments of United Irishmen like his friends Drennan and Hamilton Rowan. But rather than being political parochialism, seen in context this was actually a measure of Muir's cosmopolitanism; 'it was after all through the medium of the Irish alliance that the Scottish Friends were brought into the orbit of the wider European revolutionary movement and offered the entrancing prospect of external aid for their cause'.26 CIRCULATION/DISSEMINATION: THE TRIAL OF THOMAS MUIR In his chapter 'Cultural Conflict, Ideology, and the Reading Habit in the 1790s', Jon Klancher argues that the revolutionary decade in Britain saw the twilight of the enlightenment project of circulation, with its links to a cosmopolitan Habermasian public sphere: to circulate was 'to follow a path, however circuitous or labyrinthine its windings, along an ordered itinerary; in this motion, a cultural profit accrues'.27 Conservative commentators like Arthur Young feared that in the light of the French Revolution circulation had become a threatening dissemination; T am all amazement at the ministry permitting such nests and hot-beds of sedition and revolt, which disseminate among the people, every hour, principles that by and by must be opposed with vigour'.28 Young's 'dissemination' (which Klancher cautiously distinguishes from Derrida's influential current usage) 'flood [s] through the interstices of the social network, into the social cracks of the ancien regime... what is disseminated 'propagates' or reproduces itself without the orderly expansion of circulation'. As Young himself put it, 'one rascal writes and an hundred thousand believe', in the absence of that 'highly qualified process of common reasoning between reader and writer'.29</page><page sequence="7">54 History Workshop Journal Like other British radical reformers, Muir was an unashamed advocate of the free circulation of 'political information', as he preferred to call radical ideology. To the Tory place-holders and judges who ruled Scotland under the 'Dundas Despotism', propagating the principal of universal suffrage among weavers and tradesmen looked ominously like 'dissemination' in Arthur Young's sense, and was accordingly prosecuted as sedition during the government-orchestrated panic in the years after 1792. The demand for reform itself came to be construed by the Scottish prosecutors as a seditious intention to overthrow king and constitution along French lines: as Barrell points out, sedition would have been treason if backed by any form of popular insurrection.30 Barrell goes on to trace the labyrinthine mutation of sedition as employed in the discourse of the Edinburgh trials of March 1793, to the full-blown charge of treason brought against the English radicals in late 1794; 'what had been sedition [to the Crown prosecutors] in March was treason in September'.31 After his arrest on 2 January 1792, on charges of 'disseminating' the works of Paine and other radical writers and of reading the seditious Irish Address at the Convention, Muir was released on bail and promptly set off for London, where he addressed a meeting of the 'Friends of the Liberty of the Press' at the Freemasons' Tavern. He then proceeded to Paris - ostensibly to petition against the King's execution - where he put up at White's Hotel. He visited Helen Maria Williams' salon, mixed with Girondin leaders, and was described by Condorcet as 'le doux Ecossais'.32 The trip to Paris was the first, but certainly not the last time that a government bid to arrest Muir's transnational mobility failed. His trial in Edinburgh had been scheduled for 25 February, but the outbreak of war between France and Britain, and a delay in obtaining a passport, meant that he was unable to return in time. As a result he was promptly outlawed, his bail forfeited, and his name struck off the Faculty of Advocates. When he did return to Scotland in August 1793, after visiting leading United Irish leaders in Belfast and Dublin, he was thrown in jail, and later escorted to the Edinburgh court-room by soldiers with fixed bayonets. Defining the precise meaning of 'sedition' was the central issue in Muir's trial in Edinburgh that August. The prosecution was conducted by the Scottish Lord Advocate, Robert Dundas, nephew of the Home Secretary, and the judges were led by the notorious Lord Braxfield, later described by Cockburn as 'a coarse and dexterous ruffian' concerned only to uphold the principles of the party in power.33 The charge against Muir was that he had 'feloniously and seditiously stirred up the inhabitants against a lawful king and a good Constitution'.34 Dundas somewhat begged the questions by denouncing Muir before the court as a 'daemon of sedition' (Trial, p. 67). But in his defence Muir denied the charge of partiality, insisting that 'as he considered the information of the People to be the chief thing requisite to accomplish [equal representation], he uniformally [sic] advised them to</page><page sequence="8">Thomas Muir and 'The Telegraph' 55 read every publication, upon either side, which the important question of Parliamentary Reform had occasioned' (Trial, p. 25). The trial of course offered Muir an ideal platform from which to amplify what he described as his 'feeble voice' over Scotland and the world: a transcription was published and quickly went through three editions selling at 3/-octavo (two published in New York), and a cheaper one at l/3d. Muir's defence speech was published as a separate pamphlet and achieved huge circulation.35 As Paul Keen notes, trials like Muir's 'were themselves recuperated as literary texts which invited the readers to play the role of juries, deciding, within the sphere of the literary republic, on the merits of what had transpired within the public space of the courtroom'.36 His desire to make political capital out of the trial seems to have motivated Muir's refusal of the services of the able Whig lawyer Henry Erskine as defence council. This decision (which Cockburn suggested was made 'partly from vanity, partly from despair') would cost him dearly.37 Erskine's brother Thomas defended Tom Paine and secured the acquittal of the English radicals in the London Treason Trials of 1794: Henry Erskine, who we will meet again in the next section of this essay, might well have been able to secure a more lenient sentence for Muir, but only at the cost of playing down his client's political principles. As already mentioned, Muir was himself a trained advocate with a reputation for defending the poor and disadvantaged, but his characteristic opportunism was evident in his choice to defend himself, with a view to subverting what the government intended to be a show trial. Like Maurice Margarot and Joseph Gerrald, who also conducted their own defences the following March, Muir sought to convert the 'meta-language' of legal process into radical publicity. As a rhetorical performance, his gambit certainly paid off, for when Muir sat down at the end of his three-hour defence at one o'clock in the morning on 31 August, 'an unanimous burst of applause was expressed by the audience' (Trial, p. 131). But this moment of triumph came at a high price: five Tory judges and a packed jury of committed anti-jacobins, members of the Loyalist 'Goldsmith's Hall Association', clearly regarded Muir's idea of disseminating political information as a dangerous threat to the constitution. In summing up, Lord Henderland particularly objected to the public's applause which demonstrated that 'the spirit of sedition had not as yet subsided'. And in pronouncing the guilty verdict, Lord Braxfield admitted that the public's demonstrative support for Muir 'had no little weight with him, when considering the punishment' (Trial, pp. 134, 138). The language of the trial is obsessed with the mechanics of textual interpretation and transmission. Much to Muir's irritation, the Crown's case against him was illustrated by tendentiously selected passages culled from radical works like Paine's Rights of Man, Volney's Dialogue between the Governed and their Governors, the Declaration of Rights of the Paisley 'Friends of the People' and The Patriot, as well as the United Irishman's</page><page sequence="9">56 History Workshop Journal Address which Muir was charged with reading aloud. (Unwisely, he read the whole thing out again to a tired courtroom late at night near the end of his three-hour defence speech.) Sounding here strangely like Coleridge, Muir urged the jury to read these 'seditious' works 'organically' rather than selectively extracting 'scandalously mutilated extracts' (Trial, pp. 106, 111). He insisted that not he alone, but the whole republic of letters was on trial. In a bid to ridicule the prosecution case which parodied Paine's famous revolutionary appeal, Muir advised them to 'lay the axe to the root of the tree, and to bring an indictment against the alphabet itself, as it is the source of the evil you dread, as its parts form the component elements of sentences and paragraphs, which may contain the most dangerous sedition, and the most horrible treason'. (Trial, p. 107) Muir urged that the circulation of print in a country blessed with freedom of the press worked by means of an abstract, impersonal energy, apparently independent of the intentions of individual agents; 'the works of Mr Burke and of Thomas Paine, flew with a rapidity to every corner of the land, hitherto unexampled in the history of political science. Is there a single man amongst you [Muir asked the jury] who has not read the Works either of Paine or of Burke?' (Trial, p. 100). The prosecution then produced a succession of plebeian witnesses, weavers, barbers or house-servants, the kind of people who had filled the aisles at Friends of the People meetings in Kirkintilloch, Lennoxtown and Milton of Campsie, and whom Muir was alleged to have seduced into reading Paine, Volney, etc. As Cockburn later underlined, this part of the indictment failed miserably because of repeated evidence concerning Muir's caution in recommending Paine; one witness told the court that Muir had pronounced Rights of Man as 'foreign to their purpose' as parliamentary reformers, and had said that it 'had a tendency to mislead weak minds'. Intent on constitutional reform rather than revolution, he had encouraged his plebeian audiences to read Rev. Robert Henry's History of England, Blackstone's Commentaries, and Locke's political writings, hardly seditious works even in the biased judgement of members of the Goldsmith's Hall Association (Trial, p. 162). The failure of this strategy drove Dundas to attack the very foundations of Muir's notion of publicity. He conjured up a picture of the reformer in the back room of his father's Glasgow grocery shop; 'there, in that cathedral of sedition, he sat like a spider, weaving his filthy webs to catch the unwary' (Trial, p. 69). He travestied Muir's defence by alluding to Swift's metaphor of the Spider in the Battle of the Books: 'For pray, gentlemen, was ever anything so modern as the spider in his lair, his turns, and his paradoxes? He argues in the behalf of you his brethren, and himself, with many boastings of his native stock and great genius; that he spins and spits wholly from himself, and scorns to own any obligation or assistance from without'.38 The weaving metaphor - particularly apt considering the vocation of Muir's artisan audience - struck at the heart of Muir's account</page><page sequence="10">Thomas Muir and 'The Telegraph' 57 of the republic of letters as impersonal dissemination. In contrast to the autochthonous energy of the discourse network, Swift's spider wilfully spins and spits his webs from his own slime to ensnare the ignorant. Muir is here endowed by Dundas with all the solipsistic traits of modern 'genius' in a Swiftian battle of the books. Having failed to incriminate Muir's public conduct, the prosecution's spotlight next fell on his domestic habits. They called upon Anne Fisher, a former scullery maid at Huntershill, who displayed surprising erudition in describing Muir's reading habits, and his encouragement of others to read Volney, Paine, etc. This of course proved only how carefully she'd been coached by the prosecution.39 Fisher's evidence was vulnerable and uncorroborated by other witnesses, but unfortunately an infuriated Muir 'disdained to put a question to a witness of this description', thereby missing the opportunity to discredit her testimony.40 During his three-hour defence speech Muir made much of the fact that the prosecution had resorted to a 'domestic and well-instructed spy' (Trial, p. 112). Even if Fisher's observations on his reading Paine and the rest were true (and he made no attempt to deny them), he protested that they could carry no weight, insofar as his private reading was protected by the rules of the 'republic of letters': 'the crime of sedition, if you attend to its essence, never can be committed within the walls of a private house. It supposes the highest publicity, the convocation of many' (Trial, p. 112).41 Ironically, according to this argument, Muir might be more culpable of sedition as he stood defending himself before the Bench than he had been in the privacy of his own library. Not only the transparency of bourgeois civil society, but also the autonomy of the republic of letter (as that concept had developed in the course of the eighteenth century) seemed to be threatened by the new definition of sedition. Muir ridiculed Anne Fisher's scrupulous attention to the material details of his library: 'she saw, in my house, a copy of Paine's writings upon fine paper, and one or two copies upon coarse!' (Trial, p. 119). (Muir ignored the important point here, that the cheap editions might have been intended for dissemination outside his library.) Viewed through the literalist (and unliterary) eyes of Anne Fisher or her Tory sponsors, any book which presented a Utopian political plan might be read as critical of the British constitution, whether it were Plato's Republic, More's Utopia, Harrington's Oceania or Hume's Perfect Commonwealth: 'Gentlemen, from this moment, lock up your libraries. If they are extensive, as you have heard mine is, there is no crime in the whole catalogue, of which, by the testimony of your own servants, you may not be found guilty' (Trial, p. 119). Just as the prosecution sought to indict the whole alphabet of spelling 'sedition', so the 'gentleman of letters' was guilty of any seditious opinions which might be promoted in the books upon his library shelves.</page><page sequence="11">58 History Workshop Journal Muir concluded his tirade against this threat to the sacrosanct space of the library with an ironically prescient geographical conceit: Well do I congratulate the Lord Advocate of Scotland... He has discovered a new region in the sphere of criminality... He will not merely confine himself to voyages of discovery; But, along with his associates, he will make many voyages to this fertile land, and return home, loaded with many valuable cargoes. But [reining in his levity] seriousness becomes this place (Trial, p. 119). Dundas's new definition of sedition transforms the library - privileged enclave of the 'republic of letters' - into a sort of terra incognita of potential criminality, on the analogy of the great Southern Continent sought for by Captain Cook. Unlike the Pacific navigators whose explorations had yielded only the barren wastes of New South Wales, Robert Dundas had discovered in the library a fecund continent of criminality to enrich the statute book with crimes of sedition. It is deeply ironic that Botany Bay, first British settlement in Cook's terra australis, was to be the destination of Thomas Muir after he had been found guilty of crimes of sedition against King and constitution and sentenced to fourteen years transportation. Space prohibits any detailed commentary on Muir's harrowing voyage to the Pacific or his sojourn in the penal colony of Port Jackson, where he enjoyed certain privileges unavailable to plebeian convicts. Suffice it to say that he soon became restless with his non-circulatory existence, and in the early spring of 1796, after serving only sixteen months of his fourteen-year sentence, he escaped on board an American ship The Otter. Temporarily stopped in his tracks by the British government, Muir now put himself back into circulation with a vengeance, by means of a spectacular circumnavi gatory return journey across the Pacific to North America and thence back to Europe. At Vancouver Island Muir transferred from The Otter to a Spanish vessel bound for Baja California, hoping to make his way via Mexico City to Havana and on to Philadelphia, his chosen destination. But in Havana he was arrested by the authorities (ironically) as a British subject, and in March 1796 sent to stand trial in Spain on board the frigate Ninfa. Disaster struck when the convoy was engaged by the Royal Navy off Cadiz, and Muir was severely defaced by British shrapnel, losing his left eye and cheek while fighting for his Spanish captors. Thereafter he wore a piratical black eye-patch but never recovered from his severe wounds. Eventually he was 'repatriated' to France and given a hero's welcome by the Directory. He spent his final years in Paris plotting with Napper Tandy, Tom Paine and other British and Irish leaders to 'liberate' Scotland, England and Ireland on behalf of his 'adopted country'. Muir died of his wounds in Chantilly in January 1798 at the age of thirty-three, but not before a British spy reported that he'd been appointed as chief of the French-sponsored 'Scottish Directory' along with (in absentia) the Earl of</page><page sequence="12">Thomas Muir and 'The Telegraph' 59 Lauderdale, Colonel Norman Macleod and other Scottish 'Friends of the People'. England, Scotland and Ireland were, evidently, to be ruled as separate republics.42 To the last, it seems, Muir fantasized about 'closing the circle' by returning to Edinburgh, Coriolanus-like, at the head of a republican army. 'THE TELEGRAPH' Ironically, just as Muir was on the point of escaping from New South Wales on board The Otter, his name appeared once again before the British public on the title page of a poem entitled The Telegraph; a consolatory epistle from Thomas Muir, Esq., of Botany Bay, to the Hon. Henry Erskine, published in January 1796. It's highly appropriate, given Muir's identification with the impersonal mobility of print media, that the poem's attribution has led to some confusion. In the fly-leaf of the Cambridge University Library copy some hand has pencilled in the claim that The Telegraph is 'supposed to be the first separately published poem written in Australia'. Both Robert Hughes in The Fatal Shore, and more recently, Tom Devine in Scotland's Empire accept the title-page attribution at face value, possibly misled by the fact that the original manuscript is held by the Mitchell Library, Sydney.43 Closer inspection however reveals The Telegraph was in fact an anti-jacobin (and certainly anti-Australian) squib, which the Eighteenth-Century Short Title Catalogue attributes to the Rev. George Hamilton of Gladsmuir, a Tory poetaster and minor satirist. A future moderator of the Church of Scotland, Hamilton had already been outgunned in a poetical run-in with Robert Burns himself.44 Rather than inaugurating Australian poetry, then, The Telegraph disappointingly turns out to be a bit-player in the Scottish political logomachia of the 1790s. Nevertheless, in claiming satirically to represent Muir's voice from Botany Bay, the poem reveals its anxiety concerning Muir's cosmopolitanism as it seeks to demolish the universalist claims of the radical republic or letters. The immediate occasion for the satire was the Hon. Henry Erskine's failure to be re-elected as Dean of the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh in early 1796. Despite Erskine's political moderation (he had remained faithful to the Portland Whigs and refused to follow his brother in joining the Friends of the People), he finally decided to 'stand up and be counted', chairing a political meeting against the Seditious Writings Bill in Edinburgh on 28 November 1795 which resulted in a petition carrying 8,000 signatures. But in an election held the following January, he was deposed by a majority vote of 85-38 and replaced by the Tory Lord Advocate Robert Dundas.45 Given that Erskine had been re-elected annually since 1785, this represented a final nail in the Whig coffin on the Tory-dominated Scottish Bar. Dundas's victory over Erskine was satirized by Robert Burns in a pithy song entitled 'The Dean of Faculty - A New Ballad -': the triumph of such an inarticulate mediocrity as Dundas (the gist of Burns's joke) 'shows that</page><page sequence="13">60 History Workshop Journal Heaven can boil the pot/Though the devil piss in the fire'.46 At the other end of the political spectrum, The Telegraph exploited Erskine's defeat, and his supposed sympathy for seditious elements, by imagining him 'in correspon dence' with the transported Thomas Muir in Botany Bay. We should recall that Muir had rejected Erskine as defence council at his trial two years earlier: although in 1787 he had dedicated his Edinburgh University thesis to Erskine as Dean of Faculty, he had been frustrated by the latter's refusal to follow his brother's example by joining the Friends of the People, even after he had personally remonstrated with him.47 Nevertheless Erskine had been a stalwart of Burgh Reform, and like Muir supported the 'High Flyer' or Popular party in the Kirk. To the author of The Telegraph, the fact that both Erskine and Muir's legal careers had been shipwrecked on the rocks of 'sedition' was sufficient to bridge these political differences. The poem employed the standard tactic of lumping Erskine and the Whigs together with the more radical Scottish reformers, including Watt and Downie, executed and exiled respectively in 1794 for fomenting the so-called 'Pike Plot'. A sorrowing and broken Erskine is supported by his Whig henchmen Adair, John Clerk of Eldin and Charles Hay, future Lord Newton, while the poet gloats over the triumph of the Tory candidate Dundas; The vote is passed, and black balls fill the urn, The silken gown is from thy shoulders torn, And all thy titles, all thine honours pass To deck the person of abhorred DUNDAS! But weep not, HENRY, though thy fate be hard, For worth like thine shall meet a due reward. Succeeding times, in justice to thy fame, With Watts [sic] and Downie shall record thy name, And place thee high on the illustrious roll Of Patriots fam'd for energy of soul; Whose ardent spirits liberty inspires, To o'erwhelm the globe, and wrap a world in fire.48 'Muir' has the temerity to compare Erskine's future fame as a political martyr with his own, and invites him to join the banished patriots in Botany Bay. Government transportation to Australia is ironically repre sented as Jacobin cosmopolitanism, and Botany Bay as a Utopian site; Come to these regions, where no Despot reigns, But freedom revels in her native plains; Where the bold savage walks by nature's plan, And force upholds the sacred Rights of Man. (Telegraph, p. 5)</page><page sequence="14">Thomas Muir and 'The Telegraph' 61 Erskine is encouraged to bring along in his wake the caucus of Scottish Whigs - 'all who have virtue to detest a king': Macleod, Lauderdale, Fergusson, MacFarland and Masson. 'Muir's' description of the rulers of this Antipodean commonwealth conforms both to an eighteenth century satirical tradition best represented by Pope's Dunciad, as well as to the convention of 'antipodal inversion' described by Bernard Smith in European Vision and the South Pacific49 The decayed Irish macaroni and pickpocket George Barrington holds 'the scales of justice'; the Rev. Thomas Fysshe Palmer preaches 'pure doctrine to the convict crew' and 'Muir' himself is appointed 'King's Lord Advocate to crush High Treason' (Telegraph, p. 6). Despite paying lip service to the principle of equality, this Jacobinical polity of course runs on despotic principles, like the French Directory which inspired it. Although 'no proud title shocks the freeborn mind', Erskine is warned not to attempt to 'introduce [any] dark cabal,/No curs'd equality to level all' (Telegraph, p. 6). Muir and his radical 'placemen' are hardly likely to give up their privileges to the newcomers, although they're happy to 'find employment still for men of merit', and it will be the clubbable Henry Erskine's job to teach French dancing to the 'native savages'. In The Fatal Shore, Robert Hughes cites one of The Telegraph's few memorable passages, a 'new metaphor of revolution... [in which] an Australian bushfire makes its first appearance in English poetry'.50 The passage in question shows the extent to which the poem continues the debate about 'dissemination' which had proved so contentious during Muir's trial. Citing Captain Cook's account of Maori 'Fire Planters' in the 1772 Voyage to the South Seas (the confusion of Maori and Aboriginal ethnography here might have alerted Hughes to the improbability of Muir's authorship), Hamilton describes how: To clear the forest's dark impervious maze, The half-starv'd Indian lights a hasty blaze ... From bush to bush, with rapid steps he flies, Till the whole Forest blazes to the skies. Often, 'tis true, this deed of madness done, He mourns the mischief which his hand begun; When the red torrent rushing o'er the plain, No art can stop, no human power restrain, Till from a rock, he sees with wild amaze, His wife and children perish in the blaze! (Telegraph, p. 8) These lines possibly allude to Muir's rhetorical question to the Prosecution during his trial; 'Can you imagine that I could have wished to involve, in the conflagration of my country, my nearest relations to whose property I may eventually succeed?' (Trial, p. 117). As we've seen, the jury's answer would presumably have been 'yes, probably', and the poet here plays</page><page sequence="15">62 History Workshop Journal the common anti-jacobin card of representing radicals as cosmopolitan violators of the domestic affections as he compares them, in their ignorance and lack of foresight, to those Australian 'Indians' who were assumed to live only to gratify present appetites: he thus further enforces the link between 'jacobin reformers' and the 'bold savages who walk by nature's plan'. They'll burn down a whole forest, sacrifice their wives and children, all to satisfy a transient lust for liberty. The final section of The Telegraph takes a Miltonic turn by shifting the scene from Australia to Pandemonium, as the defeated Whigs are metamorphosed into fallen angels. (The 'Moderate' clergyman Hamilton may here have been targeting Muir's Calvinism, mapped on to his Francophile politics.) A politically ambitious Erskine qualifies for the position of Satan's prime minister 'in rank and power superiour to PITT' (Telegraph, p. 9), but, adds the poet 'Muir', should the citoyens of Pandemonium tire of Satanic tyranny, The best and noblest privileges in hell, For souls like ours is, boldly to rebel; To rear the standard of revolt, and try The happy fruit of lov'd democracy. The sacred right of insurrection there, May drive old Satan from his regal chair; And the same honest means may raise, per chance, A France in Hell, that rais'd a Hell in France. (Telegraph, p. 9) As events in post 1793 France went to show, the poet urged, revolution engenders further revolution in a descending spiral of anarchy. The Telegraph follows its conventional anti-jacobin antithesis by imagining Erskine forming a 'Directory of Hell' alongside Macleod, Lauderdale and Raith, in a strange anticipation of at least two of the personnel of the 'Scottish Directory' planned by Muir in Paris in 1797. This unremarkable poem concludes with Muir's request to Erskine that he be made 'Lord Chancellor of your dark domains' (Telegraph, p. 10), a reference to Muir's nickname of 'the Chancellor' amongst his colleagues at the Edinburgh Bar, 'owing to a story that his mother had dreamt that he would some day become Lord High Chancellor of England'.51 TELEGRAPHY AND THE 1790S 'DISCOURSE NETWORK' In this concluding section I want to consider what is perhaps the most interesting feature of The Telegraph, namely its title, and to suggest why it may have been particularly appropriate, in the eyes of anxious anti-jacobins, to the case of Thomas Muir. When the poem first appeared in 1796 the term</page><page sequence="16">Thomas Muir and 'The Telegraph' 63 'telegraphe' was a French neologism, devised in 1792 by Claude Chappe to describe a new communication technology which he had invented in the service of the revolutionary republic. The hardware of Chappe's optical telegraph, designed to transmit messages to a distance, was really a refinement on traditional signalling technology: it comprised an upright post topped with a thirteen-foot long horizontal board or 'regulateur', at both ends of which were six-foot boards or 'indicateurs'; all three could be moved from below by ropes and pulleys. The full range of combinations gave ninety-eight positions and with the apparatus placed on top of towers and silhouetted against the sky in stations seven or eight miles apart, the signals thus made could be read by telegraphists armed with telescopes along the relay chain.52 Much more sophisticated, however, was Chappe's software, which (according to Alexander J. Field) used 'a large set oichiffres primitifs (basic transmission elements) in conjunction with a coding system which associated short sequences of signals with phrases and proper names'.53 Abandoning any attempt to transmit individual letters of the alphabet as too slow and laborious, 'the French distinguished words from proper names and grouped the former into phrases (groups of words commonly appearing together, i.e. with a high conditional possibility of following each other) and the latter into names of individuals and names of places'. The phrases were listed in a vocabulaire [or code book] consisting of ninety-two pages with 8,464 precoded groupings communicable with a sequence of two signals. Similar vocabulaires were developed for places and proper names'.54 Because the code was secret, the telegraphist had to relay the signal from the upstream station and accurately replicate it without having any idea of the meaning of the message; intercepting the signals would have been pointless for anyone who didn't possess a copy of the code book. Although the basic idea was as old as Roman military signalling, Chappe's telegraphe did revolutionize data transmission: a signal could travel the 225 kilometres from Paris to Lisle in one or two minutes, or the 760 kilometres and 120 stations from Paris to Toulon in twelve minutes. The telegraph was the nearest the eighteenth century approached to an 'information super-highway'. For the modern British reader who associates the word 'Telegraph' with a broadsheet of true-blue stamp, it comes as a surprise to discover that the name originally denoted a specifically French and Jacobin means of communication. The metaphoric potential of the telegraph was rapidly exploited to describe the dissemination of news, so that as early as 1794 Coleridge was planning to accept a post as reporter for a liberal paper called The Telegraph, founded that year by Wordsworth's friend William Matthews.55 George Hamilton, author of the satire on Muir and Erskine, probably picked up his sense of telegraphy from a series of articles published in the Gentleman's Magazine in September-December 1794 which gave a detailed account of Chappe's invention, including a detailed diagram of the apparatus and some of its signals, and invited contributors to refine</page><page sequence="17">64 History Workshop Journal the original plan. The Gentleman's Magazine articles also inspired James Gillray's graphic satire 'French Telegraph making Signals in the Dark', published on 26 January 1795, which represents the opposition leader Charles James Fox using Chappe's technology to signal treasonous messages to a French fleet poised to invade a sleeping England [Fig. I].56 In its September 1794 article, the Gentleman's Magazine quoted Barrere's report on the Telegraph to the French Convention, which perfectly sums up the ideological force-field surrounding Chappe's invention: The new-invented telegraphic language of signals is a contrivance of art to transmit thoughts, in a peculiar language, from one distance to another, by means of machines, which are placed at different distances of between four and five leagues from one another... By this invention the remoteness of distance almost disappears; and all the communications of correspondence are effected with the rapidity of the twinkling of an eye. The operations of Government can be very much facilitated by this contrivance, and the unity of the Republic can be the more consolidated by the speedy communication with all its parts.57 Armed with this information, we can now return to Hamilton's poem and make more sense of its opening lines, as Thomas Muir is depicted telegraphically signalling to Henry Erskine from Botany Bay: From this remote, this melancholy shore; Round whose black rocks incessant tempests roar; Where sullen Convicts drag the clanking chain, And desolation covers all the plain; My heart, dear DEAN, with anguish turns to you, And mourns the scenes, just opening to your view. Eager the telegraphic board I rear, To paint the sorrows which you cannot hear. (Telegraph, p. 3) The first telegraphic cable from Australia wasn't available until 1871, and that of course depended upon the technological breakthrough of electronic telegraphy and Samuel Morse's new code, so that Hamilton is here indulging poetic licence. In fact, one of the reasons why optical telegraphy prospered in revolutionary and Napoleonic France rather than Britain was the fact that Napoleon ruled a consolidated land based empire (relays were built connecting Paris with Turin, Milan, Venice, Antwerp, Amsterdam and Mainz),58 whereas Britain's empire was globally-dispersed and maritime. Headrick points out that in Britain 'no government agency other than the Admiralty seem to have been the least bit interested in telegraphy; no one suggested that it could build</page><page sequence="18">Thomas Muir and 'The Telegraph' 65 national unity, prevent uprisings and conspiracies, or play any other political role'.59 And yet perhaps it stood as a metaphor for the apparently unstoppable transnational mobility of radical ideology, which could conquer 'the remoteness of distance' and communicate its democratic message 'with the rapidity of the twinkling of an eye'. Hamilton's choice of title might be taken to indicate loyalist anxieties about jacobin dissemination of seditious information of the kind which had been the focus of Muir's trial. The very fact that Hamilton's literary conceit requires him to imagine telegraphic communication (rather than the conventional 'epistolary correspondence', painfully slow in this context) between Muir the 'silenced' political reformer in Australia and Whig fellow travellers at home is indicative of anxiety, given that the purpose of transporting radicals to the other side of the world was precisely to take them 'out of circulation'. Hamilton's satire is grudgingly obliged to represent Muir's 'cosmopatriotism' as, futuristically, a triumph of media over distance via the worrying new French technology of telegraphy. We saw how Muir in the dock defended his agency in the circulation of political information as merely that of a 'relayer' rather than 'author: like a human telegraph station, Muir simply transmits the truth without interpreting it (Gillray depicts this in his anthropomorphic image of Fox as a 'French telegraph'). For Muir and the reformers it's an axiom that truth inheres in the media by which it is transmitted rather than in the will of the transmitter: as Kittler argues, in the discourse network of 1800 (or thereabouts) the truth of nature is both the medium and the message.60 Herein lies the philosophical point underpinning Muir's facetious objection that the Crown prosecutors might as well 'bring an indictment against the alphabet itself...' (Trial p. 107). Of course Hamilton's satire plays on a hyperbolic version of the eighteenth-century republic of letters, exaggerating the power of Muir's publicity by linking it with a scary, quasi telepathic modernity. Like Kittler's phoneticized alphabet, or Franz Mesmer's magnetic fluid, Chappe's telegraphic chiffre primitif operates at a higher - and speedier - order of communication than the mere letter: as Barrere insisted, the telegraph is 'a contrivance of art to communicate thoughts from one distance to another.' For Hamilton, Gillray and the anti-jacobins, then, this new media technology for conquering distance and 'consolidating the unity of the Republic' was not only an enemy secret weapon in the information war, but also a sinister metaphor for the radical discourse network. Their anxiety was an extension of government concerns about 'corresponding societies' (such as the London Corresponding Society) and the illegitimate use of the postal service.61 In common with the politics of Conventionalism, to which reformers like Thomas Muir had been driven by the failure of the petition ing system in the early 1790s, telegraphy symbolized a new organiza tional media, its protocols closely associated with republican France,</page><page sequence="19">66 History Workshop Journal which threatened legitimate flows of information sanctioned by the government.62 Despite its philanthropic and cosmopolitan claims to represent a technological breakthrough of benefit to humanity as a whole, telegraphy is here exposed as a sinister form of coded communication, the seditious content of which was only legible to those initiates already in possession of the vocabulaire. We should also note in this connection the conspiracy theories of Masonic and Illuminist plotting which emerged in 1797-98, dreamt up by counter-revolutionaries like the Abbe Barruel and Edinburgh University's Professor John Robison, both of whom dilated upon sinister secret organizations and coded transnational communications, disguised as 'reading societies and subscription libraries'. Barruel, for example, feared that Watt and Downie, instigators of the 1794 'Pike Plot', 'might have received their instructions from the Prussian Areopage' himself. (This referred to Adam Weishaupt, former professor of canon law at the University of Ingolstadt, and founder of the German Illuminati.) Barruel's English translator Robert Clifford, in an addendum to the fourth volume of the memoirs, announced that the cellular structure of the United Irishmen 'perfectly coincided with Weishaupt's plan': an entirely spurious hypothesis which the authorities in Dublin Castle apparently took literally in their counter-insurgency strategy.63 In conclusion, we might regard Hamilton's The Telegraph, as well as the conspiracy theories which followed it, as sequels to Robert Dundas's attacks on Thomas Muir 'the weaver of filthy webs' in the Sedition Trial of August 1793. Such anti-jacobin fantasies of exposure depended of course upon a fiction of effective interception (in the case of the trial, as we saw above, the patent fictionality of the testimony levied against Muir nearly jeopardized his safe conviction). In the end, the act of decipherment doesn't offer any surprises, as the same radical message appears in every case with utter predictability. Clearly what was at stake here was the medium of radical publicity rather than the message itself. This essay has aimed to enforce this point by highlighting the cosmopolitan energy lying at the heart of Scottish radicalism in the 1790s, illustrated by the extraordinary global trajectory of Thomas Muir in his circumnavigatory 'progress' from reformer to Jacobin. At the same time it has probed some of the anxieties which Muir's cosmopolitanism aroused in the Scottish establishment, and which, strangely enough, appear to have cast a long shadow over our retrospective understanding of the Scottish radical movement, and the political events of those turbulent years.
