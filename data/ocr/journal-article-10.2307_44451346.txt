<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCIENCE AND METAPHOR IN THE MEDICINE OF RESTORATION ENGLAND* PETER H. NIEBYL When R. F. Jones described the influence of science on the rise of the plain English style, he cited the critical attitude of leading members of the Royal Society toward the use of metaphor and obscure terms. In one instance he also cited a Helmontian "chemical" physician, George Thomson, though not a member of the Royal Society, for his call to study things not words, a view apparently consistent with that of the Royal Society's own historian who claimed that the Society did not regard "Names, but Things" thereby avoiding the "trick of Metaphors" and resulting in "the plainest Method."1 In his classic study of the battle at this time between "the Ancients and the Moderns" Jones included a number of Helmontian physicians in his Baconian group of Moderns.2 It therefore needs to be pointed out that the Helmontian physicians differed sharply with the scientists of the Royal Society in their attitude toward metaphor and as a consequence in their "scien- tific" method. While the humanistic use of metaphor gives rise to poetry, rhetoric, and prose style, the scientific use of metaphor gives rise to models and analogies.3 Jones did not make this distinction so that when he cites a given scientist as taking advantage of the pejorative connotation of the free use of metaphor in the humanities in criticizing the work of others, the real issue may have been one of content rather than style. Since metaphors would not be metaphors if they were true, the obvious tactic was to show your opponent was using metaphors. Even the verbose Galen criticized Archigenes for his metaphors in classifying the pulse, noting that physicians can use metaphors that appear very learned to * Presented at the 45th annual meeting of the American Association for the History of Medicine, Montreal, P.Q., May 4, 1972. 1 R.

B. Van Helmont, the early seventeenth- century Dutch critic of Galen (Van Helmont's own style has been described as "highly metaphorical") was in fact himself a violent opponent of metaphor in science and medicine. Life and disease, he said, were far too serious a matter to be described by "similitude and metaphor."6 Galen and Van Helmont were highly influential but opposing authors for the science and medicine of Restoration England.7 Galen's own approach came closest to that of the Rationalists among the ancient medical sects. In contrast to the Empiricist sect the Rationalists stressed: 1) anatomy and dissection, 2) logic proceeding by demonstration and division from axioms, postulates and definitions, 3) analogy to proceed from the evident phenomena to the unknown, and 4) acceptance of the possibility of knowing the internal, temporar- ily hidden causes, i.e. going from the visible to the invisible.8 Van Helmont and his followers in England attacked these propositions. Although only the last two directly concern metaphor, the other two are closely related, as will be seen. Artificial, Visible Models Artificial and natural, like metaphor, are ambiguous terms that, if defined too rigorously, would lose much of their meaning, so the best approach is to see how they are used. In general, an artificial object or 4 Galen, De praesagitione ex pulsibus, Opera , ed. C. G. KÃ¼hn (Leipzig, 1825), IX: 367-371. 5 Galen, Methodus me d en di, X: 61. 6 J. B.

My own inclination, as will be seen, would be to suggest that mechanistic and vitalistic positions reflect "deeper" sensibilities than immediate economic interest, sensibilities which by no means rule out political and social influence in the choice of metaphors. 8 Galen, "On the medical sects: for beginners," tr.

NIEBYL operation, unlike a natural one, is the product of conscious, civilized reason. Hippocratic and Galenic medicine attributed digestion to "concoction," literally a boiling together or cooking.9 Aristotle re- marked that the artificial processes of roasting and boiling, i.e. cooking, are specifically the same as the natural ones and lacking in separate terms since artificial operations imitate natural ones.10 Both use heat. Aristotle then went on to give a further meaning to the term concoction by identifying it with maturation, as in maturation of fruit. The term he says is used "metaphorically" since there are no specific names for each type but the processes are the same using the same heat.1 1 It makes no difference whether it (concoction) takes place in an artificial or a natural vessel, for the cause is the same in all cases.12 Van Helmont certainly had subsequent versions of the above passages in mind when he criticized the "Schools" for using metaphor and "poetic liberty" in translating the artificial cooking performed in the kitchen into the natural process of digestion performed in the living or- ganism.13 In England Everard Maynwaringe was clearly following Van Helmont with his attacks on the use of "the similitude of artificial concoctions" for digestion.1 4 There were many artificial metaphors that the Helmontians attacked. Another ancient and influential one was the comparison of life to a lamp burning oil.15 Maynwaringe, again following Van Helmont, rejected the lamp metaphor because it "does not carry any proportion or resemblance and will not hold true."16 Although Thomas Willis, a physician member of the Royal Society, frequently used the lamp metaphor, Robert Hooke, the secretary of the Society, updated it by changing the idea of old age as used-up oil for the lamp to used-up oil for a clock.17 The model was still artificial. The lamp idea persisted, 9 O. Temkin, "Nutrition from Classical Antiquity to the Baroque," Human Nutrition Historic and Scientific.

The ancient comparison of producing body heat by the ingestion of food to the exothermic reaction of mixing water with lime was dismissed by Van Helmont as that "similitude of lime . . . full of blockish ignorance."1 9 Hooke, on the other hand, thought that this and other heat producing reactions found in the world at large might very well be the same as those in the living body, and that this approach was certainly the proper method for "discovering Nature" and "im- proving Natural Philosophy."20 The English Helmontians were even cool to fermentation analogy so popular with Thomas Willis. There was, said George Thomson, "in reality a vast difference between the operations of the vital bloud, and those proceeding from the Zymosis (fermentation) of ... dead things."2 1 The Helmontians did not think it possible to bridge the gap between the living and the dead with metaphor. With regard to this "similitude of wine and blood" Maynwaringe pointed that our under- standing of wine generation and alteration is just as obscure so that "then is the analogy frustraneous and of little use."22 Henry Stubbe, conservative physician, defender of the Ancients, and critic of both the Royal Society and the Helmontians, mocked those who deem it a new discovery or a great improvement in science "if they illustrate it by a new metaphor, or introduce a novel term, the import whereof is no more emphatical or perspicuous than the former."23 Stubbe then turned around and praised Willis for making excellent use of that old Galenic similitude of wine fermentation to explain generation of the blood- adding the references to Galen, though not quite correctly, that 18 Claude Bernard, De la physiologie gÃ©nÃ©rale (Paris, 1872), p. 5.

NIEBYL Willis had apparently omitted.24 In a sense "chemical" explanations were not new. Willis's comparison of the brain and skull to chemical apparatus, a glass alembic, has been cited as typical of the whole chemical approach that had been developing.2 5 The nasal discharge from a head cold was held to be the equivalent of the distillate dripping out of the snout of the alembic. Yet Van Helmont himself had earlier rejected the analogy associating it with the ancient doctrine of catarrh.26 Indeed Galenic physicians had compared the head to a hollow cupping glass in which the condensation occurred.2 7 Even Robert Boyle remarked that it was the Galenic physicians who used the alembic analogy- adding that it shows how learned men employ chemical operations to illustrate the doctrine of diseases, as if justifying the Royal Society approach.28 At the end of the century Georgio Baglivi, a frequent user of physical analogies himself, dismissed the alembic analogy as merely a simile popular with the vulgar physicians.2 9 In this case the vulgar physicians were the learned Galenists, not Helmontians. In view of Temkin's suggestion that many metaphors in human biology are variations of that great metaphor comparing the macrocosm (the world) to the microcosm (man)- and the above in vitro/in vivo comparisons may be put in this category- it is significant that Van Helmont rejected even this great comparison calling it "poetical, heathenish, and metaphorical, but not natural, or true."30 Van Hel- mo nt's religious justification for this radical naturalism was that man was created in the image of God and not in the image of the corrupt world at large.3 1 Since the whole method of using artificial analogies 2 4 Ibid. y pp. 114, 119; Galen, On the Usefulness of the Parts , tr.

At first Boyle argues like Van Helmont, though not citing him directly by name, claiming that Paracelsus was injurious to man if he calls man but a "model" of the universe since "God was pleased to make him, not after the world's image, but his own."32 Boyle then hedged, claiming that, while the similitude may not have been so great as the Paracelsians held, the same phenomena not only occur in both worlds but are more discernible in the macrocosm than in the microcosm.33 Later in his Vulgarly Receiv'd Notion of Nature he came out, in effect, squarely against Helmontian naturalism by claiming that many things commonly ascribed to "nature" might be better ascribed to "the mechanisms of the macro- cosm and microcosm."34 Boyle even criticized the notion of nature and natural law as "improper and figurative" expressions by extending the legal metaphor to its literal definition (a notional rule of acting according to the declared will of a superior) and then pointing to the absurd presupposition of an intelligent Being capable of receiving and acting by a law, while supposedly ignoring "the general fabric of the world, and the contrivances of particular bodies."35 As if he realized that his own preference for visible structures as analogies was open to the charge of metaphor, he defended them as useful "illustrations" even though they be no more than analogies because: examples drawn from artificial bodies and things may have both the advantage of being more clearly conceived by ordinary understandings, . . . and I the less scruple to employ such examples, because Aristotle himself and some of his more learned followers make use of diverse comparison drawn from the figures and other accidents of artificial things.3 6 In short, Boyle clearly comes down on the side of Aristotle rather than Van Helmont in this crucial distinction between the natural and the artificial. Consistent with Boyle's approach, Henry Power, a physician member 32 Boyle, Works , II, 54. The extensive studies of Boyle such as Marie Boas [Hall], "The Establishment of Mechanical Philosophy," Osiris, 1952, 10: 412-541, tend to look at him more from the point of view of physics and chemistry than biology and medicine; R. H. Kargon's Atomism in England from HaÅot to Newton (London: Oxford, 1966) brings out the role of Gassend and Descartes in Boyle's hypotheticalism. 3 3 Boyle, Works , II, 76. 34 Ibid.,V , 231. 35 Ibid. y V, 170. 36 Ibid.yVy 231.</page><page sequence="7">362 PETER H. NIEBYL of the Royal Society, wrote an Analogia Physico-Chymia (1666) describing twenty analogous physiological and chemical, i.e. natural and artificial, processes. Webster has noted the close association of Power with Sir Thomas Browne.37 In support of this one should compare the following passage from Browne's Religio Medici : Now nature is not at variance with art, nor art with nature. ... In brief, all things are artificial, for Nature is the Art of God.38 with Power's assertion that it is not mere rhetoric to say, "all things are artificial; for Nature itself is nothing else but the Art of God."39 This defense probably reflected not only the fact that Browne, a meta- phorist and poetic philosopher, had been criticized for his free use of "rhetorical phrase," but also that the statement really did reflect the basic issue. Power may not have been as "skeptical"- cautious in statement is perhaps a more accurate way of putting it- as Boyle or Glanvill, but there was this overall unity of view and method that separated them from Helmontian naturalism. It has been said that it was Descartes' innovation to assert the identity of the artificially constructed product with the naturally generated one as exemplified by his view that a clock constructed from wheels is no less natural than a tree generated from a seed.40 But this view has its roots less in the separation of mind from matter (Cartesian dualism) than in the separation of God the Artificer from man, where man, however well designed, lacks a creative force. The design argument itself was of course ancient.4 1 Joseph Glanvill, a spokesman for the Royal Society who is generally characterized as a pessimistic skeptic, was nevertheless astonishingly optimistic about what had been and was going to be accomplished with chemistry, anatomy, mathematics, and with such instruments as the 37 C. Webster, "Henry Power's experimental philosophy," A mbix, 1966, 14: 151-153.

Hence, Glanvill's enthusiasm for anatomy and the microscope. Significantly, the above passage continues as follows: He were a poor physitian, that had no more anatomy, then were to be gather'd from the physnomy [i.e. physiognomy or gross clinical appearance] ,44 Elsewhere Glanvill justified his faith in anatomy, scientific instruments, and the Royal Society in a similar more explicit fashion. As we cannot understand the frame of a watch, without taking it into pieces; so neither can Nature be well known, without a resolution of it into its beginnings. . . 4 5 Boyle's equivalent of Glanvill's "poor physitian" was a "very dull inquirer." He must be a very dull inquirer, who demanding an account of the phenomena of a watch, shall rest satisfied with being told, that it is made by a watch-maker; though nothing be thereby declared of the structure and coaptation of the spring, wheels, balance, and other parts.46 It was almost inherent in the analogical approach that the believer should try to search inside the body as much as possible to show that his metaphor contained truth in it just as Galen had done with his 42 Joseph Glanvill, Plus Ultra: or, The Progress and Advancement of Knowledge (London, 1668) is usually less emphasized than the Vanity of Dogmatizing (London, 1661), which became Scepsis Scientifica (London, 1665). 4 3 Laurens Laudan, "The clock metaphor and probablism: the impact of Descartes on English methodological thought, 1650-65," Annals of Science , 1966, 22: 98.

NIEBYL anatomical dissection. Thomas Willis, the prominent physician, anato- mist, and member of the Royal Society argued similarly. When anyone would observe the motions of a clock or engine, he takes the machine itself to pieces to consider the singular artifice, and doth not doubt that he will learn the causes and properties of the phaenomenon, if not all, at least the chief.4 7 The pessimism about not learning all the causes is minimal compared to the monumental assumption that one is dealing with an "artifice" that can be understood as if we had made the thing ourselves. The Helmontians did not share the above assumption and were therefore far more pessimistic about anatomical investigation than Glanvill could ever have imagined possible. Noah Biggs, virtually paraphrasing Van Helmont, claimed that 2000 years of dissection had done nothing for the treatment of disease.48 Maynwaringe held that the only use for anatomy was to impress people since it certainly could not cure them.49 Indeed the greatest skill in anatomy cannot help a bad medicine. George Thomson criticized Willis as an anatomist for corrupting the whole by dissecting Nature.50 Van Helmont's position had been that nothing could be learned from anatomy without a knowledge of life.5 1 The "Chymists of London" were following Van Helmont when they agreed that there is great uncertainty in the "Anatomy of the Dead" and furthermore that the same is true of experimentation by fire because these are "no natural resolver of things to their primitive essences."52 They added, "For it is written, Why seek you the living among the dead?"53 For them life, disease, and Nature could not be reduced to structure even if visible only in theory. Nature as an Invisible Analogue Aristotle was aware that the term Nature had several different meanings, but the one that closest approximates the problem here at issue in health and disease is the idea that the object contains in itself 4 7 Thomas Willis, Practice of Pbysick (London, 1684), 2nd pagination, p. 32. 48 Noah Biggs, Mataeothechnia medicinae praxeos (London, 1651) Summary, p. 9; Van Helmont, Ignotus hospes morbus #90, Ignotus hydrops #10, pp. 505, 510 (504, 509). 49 Ev.

This radical distinction prevented the metaphorical bridge between inanimate arti- facts and vital processes, and thus had methodological consequences which the English Helmontian George Thomson clearly saw. I confess some small illustration made by way of simily between animate, and inanimate, mechanical, artificial, and natural, which may please the phantasie of those that are not thoroughly acquainted with the intimate, radical and efficient causes of vital power and actions; the priority (i.e. a priori-ness) of which are not intelligible by any mortal, only we are taught a posteriori, the effects.s 8 In short the artificial metaphor had only literary value, and the vital causes themselves could only be known by their overt effects. Thomson did concede that the physician must have sufficient acquaintance with the structure of the body to repair it just as a mechanic ought to be able to repair a watch or clock, but even here Thomson was only giving the weakest possible interpretations to the metaphor, for he goes on to condemn the "impertinent and superfluous searches in stinking carcasses" which are never able to teach how to cure them since they are located in the "vital light."59 Maynwaringe too was willing to concede a little to the metaphor; he acknowledged that the body was like clockwork, but the soul, he said, "lies in much s4 Aristotle, Metaphysics , tr.

NIEBYL darkness, and acts as it were behind a curtain."60 Like Thomson, he claimed the soul was undemonstrable by a priori reasoning and hence must be viewed a posteriori by its effects-,6 1 and the Helmontians saw its effects everywhere. The Helmontian "Chymists of London" unani- mously agreed at a meeting that both death and disease have their seat in the principle of life, the sensitive soul of man.6 2 As Maynwaringe put it: This vital Principle is seated in every member of the body, and does preside as Governor; and not only for defence thereof, but also to move and act in it so, as no vital office or function can be performed without the assistance and power of this internal invisible Agent.6 3 This all important vital soul was invisible. The English Helmontians never expected to see it, so why should one bother to dissect dead bodies except perhaps to prepare oneself for surgical repairs of the body in case of gross trauma. It is of course true that Boyle believed in the soul and metaphorically compared it to the pilot of a ship64 just as Descartes65 and even Aristotle66 had done, but that made little difference as long as disease was in the ship rather than in the soul as the Helmontians believed. In fact Van Helmont's son, while in England, proceeding from the doctrine that all diseases are in life, seems to anticipate the "moral therapy" of a later period with his treatise, The Spirit of Diseases; or, Diseases from the Spirit: Laid open in some observations concerning man, and his diseases, Wherein is shewed how much the mind influenceth the body in causing and curing diseases.01 Bishop Sprat of the Royal Society noted with some satisfaction that what one fails to find out when studying the body as a watch or clock is the nature of the soul and God.68 But this is precisely what the Helmontian physicians considered necessary to understand and cure disease. 60 Maynwaringe, Vita sana &amp; longa (London, 1669), 126. 6 1 Maynwaringe, Tabidorum narratio (London, 1667), pp. 6-7. 62 Anon., PÅnciples, p. 3. 6 3 Maynwaringe, The Frequent, but Unsuspected Progress of Pains, Inflammation, Tumors (London, 1679), p. 171. 64 Boyle, Works , II, 51. 65 Descartes, "Meditation VI", in Philosophical Works , tr.

Van Helmont maintained that causes were "far more hidden" than generally supposed,6 9 but he asserted that these hidden efficient causes (personified as the Archeus) contained life and its diseases in patterns or types also called "instructions" or ideas.70 Thomson said that these ideas resulted in "forging a numerous company of different pictures of diseases."7 1 Otherwise, Thomson said he could not see how a few elements could "cause so many distinct species of feavers . . . such a catalogue of calamitous infirmities, differing in symptoms."72 Mental intuition into the invisible complexities of life forced the Helmontian into a clinical stance. Glanvill, on the other hand, explicitly objected to "leaping from the effect to its remotest cause" without the "interposal of more immediate causalities."73 Conversely, the Helmontian Marcha- mont Nedham could oppose the old, "the doctrinal hypotheses" and like Thomson defend the new phaenomena of diseases,74 which for Glanvill were mere "physnomy" (i.e. physiognomy) and for Boyle mere "phaenomena of a watch." Thomson dismissed the hypotheses of Willis as "rhetorical super structure, most part sermonical, and little prac- tically salutiferous."75 To be sure, Glanvill was a skeptic, but he was primarily skeptical about the "initial causes," the "first springs of natural motions," the "skilful Archeus," or "hidden Architect," and "plastic faculty"- all of which he mocked as fine "words" but invisible and so radically different from the effects they supposedly produce that we can really know nothing about them.76 These words were no doubt among those he had in mind when he praised the Royal Society for not being "gaudy by flanting [sic] Metaphors." Ostensibly Glanvill was often attacking scholasticism, but as we shall see later, there is reason to doubt this "old hat" was his real objective. Both Helmontians and leading Royal Society members thus disliked metaphors- but differed on the metaphors they disliked. Both were 69 Van Helmont, Natura contraÅorum nÃ©scia , #13, p. 167 (163). 70 Van Helmont, Causae, et initia naturalium, #3, 11, pp. 33, 34 (28, 29). 7 1 Thomson, True Way, p. 41. 72 Ibid. 7 3 Glanvill, Vanity of Dogmatizing , p. 114. 74 March amon t Nedham, Medela medicinae (London, 1665), p. 204. 75 George Thomson, yOpdo-Â¡jLedo8o&lt; ; tarpo xvpivr): or, the Direct Method of CuringChym- ically (London, 1675), p. 156. 76 Glanvill, Vanity of Dogmatizing, p. 43, 210.</page><page sequence="13">368 PETER H. NIEBYL skeptics but differed in what they were skeptical about. Both were empiricists but differed in what they observed. To speak of metaphor, skepticism and empiricism in the abstract confuses the real issue. Finally, it should be noted that Helmontian opposition to hypoth- eses not only centered on artificial metaphors in the sense of inanimate objects and processes but also the deductive process as such. The use of axioms such as "contraries cure contraries" were called foolish rules, "As if Medicine did not work naturally, but ... by demonstration alone."77 Of Aristotle, Van Helmont said: "he hath made Logick as it were native, and proper to us by nature."78 Perhaps there is here some insight into Turbayne's recent contention that it has been a largely unrecognized metaphor to assert that Nature obeys the logic of the deductive method, that the deductive process is a physical process, reducing physics to geometry.79 For the Helmontian it was just another artificial "contrivance" of reason. Glanvill, on the other hand, gave his highest praise to geometry as "solid and real Philosophy" as a "Method" including logic in which Ramus corrected Euclid and without which one could not understand "the Artifice of the Omnis- cient Architect" and "Geometrick Mechanicks."8 0 Sir Thomas Browne had called God a geometrician. It was only later in the seventeenth and early eighteenth century that mathematical-type deduction was applied to bio-medical science.8 1 But it was to be expected from an "artificial" interpretation of Nature.

Here the role of Newton's mathematics is brought out. Perhaps there was also an aspect of Newton closer to the earlier medical approach of the Helmontians and Sydenham (to be discussed presently). Newton's "forces" (vis insitae ) may be viewed as an inherently invisible anthropomorphic metaphor like Van Helmont's Archeus insitae or Syden- ham's Nature. Newton's gravity was accused of being an occult quality. Indeed Glanvill had previously asserted that gravity as a "feigned" quality still occult and a term one might expect from a rustick, ( Vanity of Dogmatizing , p. 171). When Newton said he "feigned" no hypothesis, and both Helmontians and Sydenham had opposed hypotheses including mechan- ical ones, he too included mechanical hypotheses of the Boyle-Hooke type to the astonishment of many Royal Society members. Furthermore, Newton also put some of God into his "forces" much to the displeasure of the clock-oriented Leibniz who wanted to deal with only God's artifice.

Sydenham and Locke Sydenham's methodological position resembled the Helmontians in several ways.82 He opposed anatomy, dissection, and even use of the microscope.8 3 In a work unpublished at the time he attributed the diseases themselves to "the invisible and insensible spirits that govern, preserve and disorder the oeconomie of the body,"84 and went on to identify it with "this Archeus by which name Helmont has as clearly and intelligently explained it" calling it more useful than anything the anatomist can show.85 Sydenham's rejection of "physiological hypoth- eses" in favor of painting "portraits" of diseases may be viewed as consistent with Helmontian concern with the "pictures" of disease phenomena produced by the invisible Archeus.86 The "pictures" presuppose a vitalist painter rather than a physiological mechanism. Now Henry Power, consistent with the anatomical approach to the metaphorical watch typical of the Royal Society, criticized those 8 2 Sydenham seemed to be following Van Helmont in believing that the disease itself was an effort to expel the cause exemplified by the thorn.

King attributes this to Sydenham's poor education, The Road to Medical Enlightenment 1650-1695 (New York: Elsevier, 1970), p. 116. Wolfe notes Boyle's favorable view of anatomy but not the Helmontian opposition. Van Helmont himself was well educated. 84 Thomas Sydenham, "Anatomie, 1668," in Kenneth Dewhurst, Dr. Thomas Sydenham (1624-1689) His Life and Original WÅtings (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1966), 91.

Without getting involved in the question of whether Van Helmont's (or Sydenham's) concept of disease in general is or is not ontological, it may be noted that Pagel, with justification, has used a dual Archeus and a dialogue between them in his most recent version of Van Helmont's "externalised" concept of disease, W. Pagel, "Van Helmont's Concept of Disease- To Be or Not To Be?" Bull. Hist. Med., 1972, 46. 419-454. Yet it is probably still fair to say that Van Helmont often talks as if there is only one Archeus involved in the disease process- as do his 17th century followers and critics- reacting to an external occasional cause.</page><page sequence="15">370 PETER H. NIEBYL notional speculators who "like a rude country fellow" only look at the "visible effects," the movement of the hands, without understanding the internal fabric of the watch as does the anatomist and microscopist, who like a skilled "artificer," knows the "internal contrivance of such anatomical engines."87 Sydenham in effect turned Power's use of the clock metaphor upside down by identifying with the "miserable beings" and "rude admirer" who cannot possibly know the way the Supreme Artificer made the elegant clock.8 8 As if he were Glanvill's "poor physitian" and Boyle's "very dull inquirer," Sydenham the clinician was quite content merely to look at the visible effects and attribute them to an invisible Nature whose mechanisms cannot and need not be known for the practice of medicine. Significantly, John Locke, physician as well as philosopher and close friend of Sydenham, used the clock metaphor in the same way as Sydenham, identifying with the ignorant "countryman," who, unlike the intelligent watch- maker, sees only the outward motions of the watch or clock. He uses this example to illustrate his belief that: The workmanship of the all-wise and powerful God in the fabric of the universe, and every part thereof, further exceeds the capacity and comprehension of the most inquisitive and intelligent man, than the best contrivance of the most ingenious man doth the conceptions of the most ignorant of rational creatures.89 In the debate among philosophers over Locke's Realism the above passage has been quoted by Yost to illustrate Locke's "pessimism." A more optimistic interpretation is given by Mandelbaum and subse- quently Laudan by trying to associate Locke's views with Boyle's. Part of the problem rests on deciding what constitutes scientific knowledge for Locke. The pessimistic view derives from the assumption that science is only concerned with the hidden internal mechanism. The optimistic interpretation of Locke tries to maintain that Locke allowed for some fruitful hypothetical knowledge about the same internal mechanism, and that we can have some presumptive knowledge of the 8 7 Power, Experimental Philosophy , p. 193.

Wolfe, "Sydenham and Locke," p. 210, considers the passage extraordinary and does not cite Locke's or Power's use of the metaphor. 89 John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding , ed. A. C.

Boyle criticized physicians in general for not being able to explain why rhubarb purges and suggests that his "fertile and comprehensive principles of philosophy, the motions, the shapes, magnitudes and texture of minute parts of matter" will be able to give such explanations by viewing the body as an engine of many strainers of differing textures (liver, spleen, kidneys, etc.) through which these medications must pass.9 1 Locke, on the other hand, acknowledged that if one would discover the figure, size, texture, motions of the minute constituent parts, then one could explain why rhubarb purges. But whilst we are destitute of senses acute enough to discover the minute particles of bodies, and to give us ideas of their mechanical affections, we must be content to be ignorant of their properties and ways of operation; nor can we be assured about them any further than some few trials we make are able to reach.92 Even these few trials should probably be interpreted as clinical trials. Much closer to Locke than Boyle is Sydenham's rhetorical question asking how one could demonstrate the pores in the liver, kidneys, or other parts, and how this could help treatment or show the action of rhubarb on these pores and particles.9 3 Later in his Essay Locke again returns to the watch metaphor in the context of dealing with the . philosophical problem of dividing genera into species. The watch serves as an example of a generic artificial thing which can be divided into species according to its internal contrivance although some ignorants may only view it generically from the outside. Locke then says that there is more confusion and uncertainty with regard to natural things. . . . the species of artifical things are distinguished, with less doubt, obscurity, and equivocation than we can in things natural, whose differences and operations depend upon contrivances beyond the reach of our discoveries.94 Locke, like the Helmontians, believed in an unbridgeable gap between the artificial and the natural.

NIEBYL medicine internal mechanisms were unacceptable. This of course still left an empirical level for clinical description. One of the important functions of logic in Galenic medicine had been to aid division of genera or diseases into species. Now the ultimate species of disease would in effect have to rest on gross clinical description without the aid of deductive categories, and significantly, this statement could also serve to characterize Sydenham's well known "empirical" achievement in medicine. The watch was in a sense the "black box" of scientists in Restoration England but it also illustrates how a root methapor can tie together both the philosophy, methodology, type of empiricism and content of a scientific community and those of another that opposes it.9 5 Socio-cultural Factors Scholars of English literature such as Jones, Williamson, and Cope have long associated Restoration attacks on metaphor with Anglican attacks on enthusiasm, especially Puritan enthusiasm, and Glanvill has been recognized as a leader in this attack.96 His target was ostensibly the pedantic traditionalism and the Aristotelian scholasticism the Puritans had attacked long ago.97 Significantly, Van Helmont himself was considered an "enthusiast" by many.98 Sprat, who like Glanvill was an Anglican cleric, spokesman for the Royal Society, and opponent of metaphor, accused one group of chemists, clearly the Helmontians, of being "downright enthusiasts."99 Similarly, Willis, also a Royal Society Anglican, attacked pseudo chymists who were obviously Hel- montians as "fanatic."1 00 Curiously enough, the term "enthusiasm" cannot only be applied to the Helmontians' own socio-political behavior but to their metaphors as well. The personified diseased parts, far from showing cool, rational behavior- as one might expect from the vis medicatrix naturae- tended 95 Derek J. de Solla Price, "Gods in black boxes," in Computers in Humanistic Research , ed.

Associated with this was a favoring of practice over theory, fact over logic, and the natural over the artificial- a protest of Nature against Art.102 Van Helmont's naturalist protest against artificial metaphors may be viewed as partly a result of this larger development, as well as his own anti-academic attitude towards the "Schools." This anti-rationalism that may be viewed as a kind of sub-cortical enthusiasm was not going to appeal to the Anglicans in their quest for Rules and Reason regardless of their actual political and economic behavior. Mechanical metaphors have a certain built-in stability and rigidity, as well as predictability, which can have political parallels. Sennert, in his previously mentioned criticism of the artificial clock and watch meta- phor used to explain biological generation, noted that at the same time an equally unnatural political analogy was drawn whereby, just as the mechanical instrument supposedly runs by itself without interference after the artist has made it, so too it is asserted that the King or other Potentate rules distant lands without direct control but by virtue of having conferred laws, judges, ministers and vicars which then operate by themselves. In contrast to this absentee ruler Sennert himself believed that the living seed required the actual presence of the vital soul, the artificer himself. Van Helmont variously identified the Archeus with a monarch or a master workman. Maynwaringe, the English Helmontian, claimed that the soul governs man by a monar- chical power and to admit of any other Principle as sharing in this government was "a diminution of Royalty, and lessening of the Prerogative."103 For example, he argued that the Galenic doctrine of elemental temperments "dethrones and devests the governing principle of its regality and ruling power."1 04 The politicized watch metaphor appeared again in Nehemiah Grew, the plant anatomist and believer in "divine art," who argued that the watchmaker's art was analogous not only to nature but to the wisdom of the king "not seen by his interposing himself in every case, but in the 101 Niebyl, "Sennert, Van Helmont, and medical ontology," Bull.

NIEBYL contrivance of his laws and constitution of his ministers."1 05 It appeared in the well-known Clarke-Leibniz debate in which Clarke defended Newton's ever-present God against Leibniz's absentee clock- maker who left the universe in a perfect pre-established order that would run forever.1 06 Clarke argued like Sennert and Maynwaringe: If a King had a Kingdom wherein all Things would continually go on without his Government or Interposition, or without his Attending to and Ordering what is done therein: It would be to him, merely a Nominal Kingdom; nor would he deserve the title of King or Governor.1 0 7 Leibniz's reply, as KoyrÃ© points out, was to imply that this was a view of the enthusiastic Socinians of God, a significant thought since Clarke, Newton, and Locke were all Unitarians and not close to the views of the established Church.1 08 It has been said that the main theological problem of the seventeenth century was the definition of God's power.109 Certainly the main political problem of the age was the definition of the King's power. We have seen that one of the main bio-medical problems of the age was the definition of the vital spirit's power in the human body. Metaphor would seem to have allowed for some cross-over in thought both for those favoring free, even spontaneous will and those favoring more permanent structure. Whatever the degree of political and theological involvement in the choice of metaphor in science and medicine, the fundamental problem of the relation of the "artificial" to the "natural" seems both much older and at the same time much more modern, and therefore perhaps deeper than the immediate political and theological problems of Restoration England. At the close of the seventeenth century Georgio Baglivi, although highly critical of the many "fictitious similes" used by ignorant physicians, nevertheless acknowledged that "arguing by way of analogy and similitude" was responsible for all the discoveries of medicine and experimental philosophy of this last age.1 1 0 105 Nehemiah Grew, An Idea of a Phytological History Propounded (London, 1673), pp. 101-103, cited by Richard S.
