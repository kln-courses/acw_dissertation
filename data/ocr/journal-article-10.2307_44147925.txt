<plain_text><page sequence="1">MONKS, LAITY AND THE INTRODUCTION OF THE IMAGE CULT IN THE NORTH-WEST Sarita Khettry Buddhism is one of the important religions of India. The available data suggest that Buddhism reached the North-West by the 3rd century BC or during the reign of the Mauryan king Asoka (c. 273-236 B.C.).1 The north -western part of the Indian subcontinent included the territory now politically in Pakistan (Pak-Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Sind and Baluchistan), Jammu and Kashmir (partly occupied by Pakistan), the Punjab and parts of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. In ancient period the culture of the North-West extended up to the Hindu-Kush. So parts of eastern Afghanistan up to that range may be considered as within the north-western section of the Indian subcontinent. From the 3rd century B.C. to the lsl century B.C. some important developments took place in the history of Buddhism in the area concerned. During the time of Asoka an attempt was made to introduce the religion among the common mass. There is no doubt that there were lay society of the Buddhists in early Buddhism. But the religion was concentrated among a section of the laity. The reason for not appreciating the religion in the early phase by the laity was its much philosophical and rigid doctrine, particularly about the retirement from worldly life, which was only meant for the monks and recluses. The other important features of the religion was the establishment of the stupas over the corporeal relic of the Buddha, the practice of circumbulating the stupa and relic worship. The performance of these acts on the part of lay devotee was considered as a work of religious merit. In the subsequent ages i.e. in the early Christian centuries some radical changes were noticeable in the doctrinal aspect as well as in the artistic tradition of the North-West. The age witnessed the appearance of the anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha under the aegis of Gandhara school of art, the introduction of the image cult and the rise of certain traits of Mahayana like the concept of new Bodhisattva etc. In the present paper we are concerned with the introduction of the image cult in the North-West. At that time the role played by monks and laity in introducing the cult of images is also taken into account with the help of epigraphical sources. The question of introduction of the image cult in the North-West is associated with the earliest representation of the Buddha in human</page><page sequence="2">Ancient India 93 form in the region concerned. In the system of Hinayana or early Buddhism there was no image of the Buddha to which worship was offered by any Buddhist. Buddha did not believe in making icon or image worship. Therefore, in early Buddhist art of India he was never represented in human form. His presence was marked by symbols such as Bodhi tree or the Wheel of the Law, by his footprints or his umbrella and by an empty throne. These aniconic forms are well represented in the Buddhist art of India from the 2nd century B.C. to the lsl century B.C. at Bharhut, Sanchi and Bodh-Gaya.2 This aniconic period was succeeded by that of an iconic age towards the end of the lsl century B.C. or in the beginning of the lsl century A.D. What factors contributed to the change? Buddhism, however, flourished in a thriving society where religious speculation was rife and where, along -side orthodox Brahmanism and the new unorthodox sects, popular religion was often expressed by devotion to local deities (including Yakshas, Yakshis and Nagas). Moreover, at least from the second century B.C. the great cults of sectarian Hinduism, those of Siva and the Vaishnava deities, Vasudeva -Krishna and Balarama, were growing in popularity, and they too seem to have experienced no obstacle to producing images of their chosen deities for popular worship. Therefore, Buddhism found itself in an environment in which devotion and the worship of images were accepted.3 On the other hand, another way was rapidly gaining ground in the thoughts of common people-the way of love and devotion. So they wanted some concrete objects in the form of images to which their prayer and devotion could be directed. And with these changing ideals the position of the Buddha also changed. He had become, or at least was rapidly becoming the divine savior of mankind. It may well be that the sectarian schism which split the Buddhist monastic order at the time of the second and third Councils had some bearing. The Mahavastu ,4 a text of the Mahasamghika school of the 2nd century BC, extolled the Buddha as the highest God. On the other hand, Lalitavistara 5 a text which belonged to the Sarvastivadins,6 described the Buddha as a divine being and not as a highest God. It may, therefore, be stated that in the 2nd and lsl centuries B.C., a certain section of the Buddhists regarded the Budha as the highest God while another section as a great being. Thus, he should be worshipped in the iconic form. We can refer to the name of Sarvasivadins who were associated with the origin of the Buu 'ha image. Here we can quote Professor Tucci who put the matter well when he wrote: The transition from non-representation to anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha need not have been caused by the sudden appearance of a foreign art type. More probably it was the result of new spiritual directions in Buddhism itself: increased emphasis on</page><page sequence="3">94 IHC : Proceedings , 67th Session , 2006-07 the laity, on devotionalism, the need for a saviour, compounded by the political drive to reach new peoples accustomed to other religious forms.7 The date at which this new concept of image of the Buddha was accepted by Buddhists and the precise manner that it came about are both obscure, but there is good reason to believe that the first representation of the Buddha in bodily form dates back to the beginning of the first century A.D.8 if not somewhat earlier. Equally, it is still not possible to put any firm date on when or where the first images of the Buddha were produced. Generally it has been held that either Mathura or Gandhara (in the North-West) was the region where the innovation first occurred. We cannot subscribe to the exclusive claims of either one, since it seems likely that the change occurred more or less simultaneously in both the areas. A large number of different varieties and forms of the images of the Buddha were discovered at the time of excavation at various sites like Jalalabad, Hadda and Bamiyan in Afghanistan, the Swat valley (Udyana), Taxila, Takht-i-Bahi in the Yusufzai country, Sahr-i-Bahlol, Bala Hissar at the junction of the Swat and Kabul rivers, Charsada, Palatu and Ghaz dheri etc. during the early Christian centuries. With the advent of the image of the Buddha, people started worshipping him in his iconic form. The Sarvastivada sect was mainly responsible for introducing worship of the image of the Buddha. It appears from the name that the Sarvastivadins believed in the theory of 4Sarvam asti' ('everything exists'). Its significance, however, is seen when this idea was extended to the beliefs concerning the person of the Buddha. Namely, he was only one among previous beings who had attained Enlightenment, and the past having real existence can be recaptured. Therefore, the present and future, having the same real existence, can produce similar enlightenment among those who prepare themselves for it. In the Avadanas, we find reference to the Boddhisattva ideal. So far as the Buddha himself is concerned, the Sarvastivadins emphasized his human characteristics. This is explained in the Lalitavistara 9 which presses the point that 'it was not as a God that he turned thz Wheel of the Doctrine, for, otherwise human beings would be discouraged, thinking we are mere men and unable to reach the state of a God.' Therefore, it becomes clear that the Buddha was regarded as a supreme example to be worshipped and emulated. The Bodhisattva aspect of the Buddha became an important consideration in the beliefs of the worshippers. This is further clear by the evidence of Shah-ji-ki-Dheri casket inscription where for the first time the name of the Sarvastivadins appear in connection with the worship of the image of the Buddha.10 That the worship of the Buddha continued to</page><page sequence="4">Ancient India 95 flourish in the 7th-8lh century A.D. is attested by the acc unts of Chinese pilgrims. His worship is performed with offerings of flowers and incense, besides prostration and recitation of mantras, etc. Both Hsuan- tsang and I-tsing noted that music and singing accompanied the performance of worship of the Buddha. According to I-tsing, the monks of India had in their cells, in a window or niche, an image of the Buddha which they treated with respect and veneration. Each morning they bathed it and offered flowers and incense to the icon. At midday, they presented part of their meal to it.11 The question arises, 'What role did the monks and laity play in the introduction of the cult images'? We know that the Samgha or Buddhist community consists of four assemblies: mendicant monks ( bhikshu ), nuns ( bhikshuni ), laymen ( upasaka ) and laywomen (upasika). Although the monk and the layman represent divergent tendencies which, without coming into direct opposition were to be asserted with increasing explicitness. On the one hand, the ideal of renunciation and personal holiness and on the other, active virtues and altruistic preoccupations.12 This two tiered model according to Gregory Schopen,13 has particularly affected our understanding of such things as the introduction of the cult of images into Indian Buddhism. Sixty years ago A.K. Coomarswamy said: ... it may well be asked how it came to pass that Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism alike became 'idolatrous1 religions. The answer to this question was admirably expressed by Jacobi over forty years ago: 'I believe that the worship had nothing to do with original Buddhism or Jainism that it did not originate with the monks but with the lay community, when the people in general felt the want of a higher cult than that of their rude deities and demons, when the religious development of India found in Bhakti the supreme means of salvation. Therefore instead of seeing in the Buddhists the originals and in the Jains the imitators, with regard to the erection of temples and worship of statues, we assume that both sects were brought to adopt this practice by the perpetual and irresistible influence of the religious development of the people in India.14 That this model is still very much current can be seen in even the most recent discussions of the early image cult.15 It is generally believed that Indian Buddhism was a religion dominated by the religious elite. But then it immediately asserts that these 'enlightened elites' 'the so called monks' were apparently able only to react. The change and innovation were apparently out of their hands and were the result of the pressure of popular lay feeling; it was the laity, as seen above, which brought the change and innovation. This is not the case always. The picture is a reverse one. With the help</page><page sequence="5">96 IHC: Proceedings, 67th Session , 2006-07 of the donative inscriptions found at individual sites we are able to document the role of the process. We have taken here the sites of North-Western India. A large number of Kharoshti inscriptions have been discovered from the North- west. They belonged to the early Christian centuries. They are donative in nature recording the meritorious gift of the donor. Here we can refer to the eighteenth Kharoshti inscriptions edited by S. Konow that record the gifts of images and in which the name of the donors is preserved. Of this eighteen, more than two-thrids (or thirteen) record the gifts of monks.16 In this connection mention should be made of eight inscribed images of the Buddha from Jaulian monastery. They were the gifts of the monks. Mention should be made of one inscribed dated image of Bodhisattva from Lorian Tangai, two inscribed image of the Buddha from the same site, one inscribed image of the Bodhisatva from Shahr-i Napursan in which the term sramana is used before the name of the donor, one inscribed image from Yakubi, which represents the 'miracle of Sravasti' etc. Again, of the eight dated Gandhara sculptures,17 three were the gifts of the monks. In three the status of the donor is unclear or problematic and in the two others the donors are laypersons. It is worth mentioning here that even if in all three of the dated inscriptions in which the donor's status is unclear the donor is assumed to be a lay person. This would still mean that almost 60 per cent of the inscribed images from the North-West now known were given by monks. It is also interesting to note that of the eight dated Gandhara pieces, two earliest dated images were the gift of the monks. It is worth noting here that of the twenty six altogether inscribed images sixteen were given by monks but there is none in which the donor is nun. The reasons for this are not yet clear. Although this is a preliminary study of Buddhist donative inscriptions associated with images in the North-West, still a number of points are clear. The monastic role in the cult of images is apparent from the above study in the region concerned. Undoubtedly of the several major regions of Buddhist sites North-West was the one were the Cult images were introduced at an early period. A picture of actual monk is also discerned in Indian Buddhism during this period. Who were these monks who stimulated the change and innovation? To me he is certainly not a textual or ideal monk involved in getting the highest truth of Buddhism i.e. Nirvana. He is the actual monk who is preoccupied in religious giving and cult practice of every kind. He is concerned as well, for example, with the health of his companions, parents and teachers. He appears, in short, as very human and</page><page sequence="6">Ancient India 97 vulnerable.18 In order to find out more about them we have to wait for new discoveries. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1. R.G.
