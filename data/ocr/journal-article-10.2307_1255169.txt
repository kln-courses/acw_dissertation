It is, it may be said, arguable that the evidence from mother-right and totemism does not materially strengthen the argument, but the use of doubtful materials weakens conclusions which find their best support from other sources. With these reservations we may accept this delightful book as a valuable contribution to our knowledge of the beliefs of ancient Greece. It remains to be proved how this novel method of interpretation will stand the test when it is applied, as is inevitable, to solve like problems beyond the Hellenic area. The risk that Miss Harrison's conclusions may not be regarded as final is only the condition more or less of all pioneer work in the advancement of learning. W. CROOKE. LA SOCIEITE MUSULMANE DU MAGHRIB. MAGIE ET RELIGION DANS L'AFRIQUE DU NORD. Par EDMOND DOUTTE. Alger: Typographie Adolphe Jourdan, I909. 8vo, pp. vi+ 6i7. THE author of this important work is Professor at the Efcole Superieure des Lettres at Algiers, and the book itself has grown out of a course of lectures delivered by him in that capacity. The subject of this course of instruction was the application to the religious phenomena observed in North Africa of the theories elaborated during the last half-century by anthropologists, especially by the English and French schools. An introductory chapter discusses the exclusively religious character of Moslem civilization and polity, the limitations of all other knowledge than theological, and the suspicious attitude of Islam to art of almost every kind. The clash of Moslem culture with that of the different peoples subjected to its sway is sketched. Its most complete triumphs have been won over the civilizations, either primitive or degenerate, in or near the Mediterranean basin, among peoples who differ little at bottom from the Semitic races, and in climates and countries 396</page><page sequence="2">Reviews. 397 analogous to those of its birthplace. The further it spread east- ward,-to Persia, India, China, and the Malayan area,-the more it suffered deformation. In studying Moslem civilization it is essential to take a typical example of that civilization. Such an example the author finds ready to his hand in Morocco. There, once it had been conquered by Islam, a fairly stable Mohammedan civilization had been developed, in isolation from Christian and modern influences, by a people not brilliant indeed, but of average mental and physical endowments, and under a climate not too far removed from that which had given birth to the religion of the Prophet. There the type had been preserved almost unaltered for ages; perhaps without exaggeration it may be said that there of all Mohammedan countries the purest Moslem civilization had been preserved. This is not to say that under the predominant Mohammedanism there may not be discerned many traces of more ancient religious practices. A new religion,-it is a commonplace of anthropology,-never succeeds in wholly effac- ing the old. Islam has been more successful than most in doing so, and Islam has never been able to make a clean sweep of its predecessors, even in its own birthplace. In Morocco not a few customs exist which, though not forbidden, are looked at askance by the more pious and precise. They are left to women and children, or to the lower strata of the population. Two of the most interesting chapters in the volume before us are dedicated to the Carnival as it is practised in Morocco, and other periodical celebrations and rites which, whatever they may be, are not trace- able to Mohammedanism, but are far earlier in origin. Other chapters are concerned with magicians and magical rites, incanta- tions, talismans, divination, and sacrifice. But the core of the work is to be found in the discussion on the relations between magic, science, and religion. The author holds with MM. Hubert and Mauss that magic is a technique. It springs from the emotions, the desires, and is an attempt to give effect to them. It does not, however, imply the notion of an invariable relation between cause and effect: it is not a false science. Founded in savagery, it is rooted in the savage nature. Now the savage is emotional rather than ratiocinative. He has not yet attained to the notion of the invariable relation between cause</page><page sequence="3">Reviews. and effect. His ideas are confused, and his practice moves in the obscure domain of the emotions. It is in its origin more or less a direct reflex of them. Nor is sympathetic magic the whole of magic. If it were, the rite, instead of being overcharged with useless details, as it so often is, would necessarily be simplified; it would reduce itself to the more or less strict imitation of the effect intended. But the contrary is the case. It becomes a thicket of practices, imagined in order to satisfy the desire and multiplying themselves tumultuously. The principal rite sur- rounds itself with accessory rites, precaution after precaution is taken, a mysterious fear makes itself felt; for in magic one has to do with a special force. That force is the mana, the orenda. It is the magician's will which he seeks to make a material and active reality. It may exteriorize itself, attach itself to objects, even pre-exist in them. This is the true magical power. The position is illustrated by an analysis of the essentially magical superstition of the Evil Eye,-an analysis which the want of space forbids me to reproduce. Summing up, M. Doutte declares that magic invented under the pressure of need is only the objectivation of the desire under the form of a force extended, singular, bound to gestures repre- sentative of the phenomenon desired and mechanically reproducing it. According to his view magic preceded religion. But religion does not owe its origin to any conviction on the part of the savage that he has not the power that he thought he had. It is not due to any revulsion of feeling consequent on repeated dis- appointments. On the contrary, it arises from the savage exteriorizing magical power so far that he finishes by personifying it. In such a proceeding we have the genesis of a god. The god may be a personified mana and wear the aspect of a great magician. Thus the Creator of the universe is declared in a Malay charm-book quoted by Mr. Skeat to have been the eldest magician. In a word, so far from being opposed from the beginning to religion (or rather to theism, the belief in gods, for M. Doutte reserves the word religion for another meaning), magic is the true theoplasm. The god is necessarily anthropomorphic: he is the objectivation of man in phenomena. Theism retains many of the ideas of magic: mana, magical force expanded and 398</page><page sequence="4">Reviews. moving, radiates for ever around the god. It is the baraka of the Moslem; it transmits itself like magical force. Theism is, like magic, a construction d priori; like magic, it is dominated by emotion; like magic, contradictions abound in it, and theologians spend their strength in reconciling them. Like magic, too, theism has a practical aim: it is a technique. It is occupied, first with immediate physical needs, and secondly with moral needs. One characteristic alone distinguishes it from magic,-the personifica- tion of power essentially magical as a distinct will. As a consequence the constraining character of the rite disappears. The god, having a free will, can no longer be mechanically compelled. He must be conciliated; and thus prayer replaces the charm. The magician commanded nature; the worshipper, on the other hand, preserves towards the god to whom he prays an expectant and receptive attitude which is characteristic of theism. But magic is a collective creation. The needs that have given birth to it are collective needs,-food, sunshine, rain, and so forth. The magician only exists because his fellow-tribesmen believe in him, because they claim and await his magical acts in a state of excitability predisposed to illusion; they communicate to him their faith, even if he otherwise would not have it. The belief in magic, the ideas of magic, are not merely the product of a state of society; they are the product of society, not of the individual; and as collective beliefs and ideas they impose them- selves on the individual,-he cannot escape from them. But, when magic is diverted to individual purposes, it tends to become anti-social. The interest of some persons finds itself in conflict with the general interest; and they apply magical processes to ends injurious to the community, or to ends that may be strictly personal. Thus, side by side with the lawful and even obligatory magic which sustains the life of the society, another magic springs up harmful or at least useless to society, and as such reprobated and forbidden, or hardly tolerated. The social magic is termed by M. Doutte religion, the anti-social witchcraft. It becomes an anti-religion, and ends by modelling itself on religion, and borrowing its methods and processes. The author examines many of the beliefs and practices of Islam with the object of showing that much of magic has been taken up 399</page><page sequence="5">Reviews. into the official religion. Mohammed recognized the Evil Eye. The reality of witchcraft is a dogma. Miracles are magic. Mohammedan doctors have exercised themselves in distinguish- ing between the saint's miraculous act and the sorcerer's prodigy; and they have declared that the sole difference is in the morality of the aim pursued. A miracle is legitimate witchcraft, and witchcraft is forbidden miracle. The Prophet himself recom- mended the employment of magical incantations: he only forbade those that have a polytheistic character. He himself employed rites in their essence magical, and uttered incantations. The ceremonies at the Kaaba, which he consecrated and perpetuated, are in effect magical. It is only witchcraft,-anti-social magic,- that is forbidden in Islam. But, besides religion and witchcraft, there is another group of facts observable in Morocco, which are neither permitted nor forbidden, though not usually viewed with a favourable eye by orthodoxy. They belong -to folklore, and include such celebra- tions as the Carnival and the Midsummer fires. They represent, in fact, ancient magical practices that once had a religious force, but in course of time have been disintegrated, so to say, from religion. The ideas, the myths, the beliefs connected with these practices have for the most part disappeared, and can only be reconstructed from the rites that remain. Some of them seem to coincide with festivals and solemnities, which have been taken up into Islam, but are themselves probably survivals of pre-existing pagan Arab customs. These theories will be recognized as in general correspondence with those of the English and French schools, to which the author acknowledges his indebtedness, repeatedly citing Prof. Frazer, Mr. Marett, Messrs. Hubert and Mauss, and other anthropological and sociological investigators. The rest of the book may without unfairness be described as an application of the theories to the various practices and beliefs found in Morocco. The careful and detailed account of the phenomena it comprises is of the utmost interest to students of folklore, and will long remain an authorita- tive exposition of custom and superstition in a society hardly as yet disturbed by modern conditions and scientific discovery.
