<plain_text><page sequence="1">VI.-NEW BOOKS. [Thzese Notes do not exclude Critical Notices later on.] Thwe Methods qf Ethics. By HENRY SIDGWICK:, Knightsbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Cambridge. Third Edition. London: Macmillan, 1884. Pp. xxx., 505. A Supplement to the Second Edition of the Methods of Ethics. Containing all the important Additions and Alterations in the Third Edition. Pp. viii., 184. The Methods of Ethics, which appeared in the Second Edition of about the saine size as in the First, though the changes, as set out also in a separate Supplemient, were very considerable, has now undergone a still more thorough revision, with changes which, though not extending to the whole 184 pp. of the new Supplement, again separately issued for the con- venience of possessors of the previous editions, add, when the final balance is struck, quite 30 pp. to the size of the original work. The new matter will, it is hoped, very soon be duly examined in these pages, where former editions of the work have not been overlooked. Meanwhile the author's own account of the distinctive features of the present issue is quoted: " In this third edition, I have again made extensive alterations, and intro- duced a considerable amount of new matter. Some of these changes and additions are due to modifications of my own ethical or psychological views ; but I do not think that any of these are of great importance in relation to the main subject of the treatise. And by far the largest part of the new matter introduced has been written either (1) to remove obscurities, ambiguities, and minor inconsistencies in the exposition of my views which the criticisms of others or my own reflection have enabled me to dliscover; or (2) to treat as fully as seemed desirable certain parts or aspects of the subject which I had either passed over altogether or dis- cussed too slightly in my previous editions, and on which it now appears to me important to explain my opinions, either for the greater complete- ness of my treatise,-according to my own view of the subject,-or for its better adaptation to the present state of ethical thought in England. The most important changes of the first kind have been made in chaps. 1 and 9 of Book i. ['Introduction,' 'Good'], chaps. 1-3 of Book ii. ['Principle and Method of Egoism,' 'Empirical Hedonism '], and chaps. 13 and 14 of Book iii. [' Philosophical Intuitionism.' 'The Suinmum Bonum']: under the second head I may mention the discussions of the relation of intel- lect to moral action in Book i. chap. 3, of volition in Book i. chap. 5, of the causes of pleasure and pain in Book ii. chap. 6, of the notion of virtue in the morality of Common Sense in Book iii. chap. 2, and of evolutional ethics in Book iv. chap. 4 (chiefly)." Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research. Parts iv.-vi London: Triibner, 1883, 4. Since reference was last made in MIND XXXII., 621, to the Proceed- ings of this Society, three more Parts have appeared. In these are especially to be noted the accounts of "Experiments on Thought-Trans- ference," by Mr. Malcolm Gluthrie of Liverpool (iv., v.), followed by the account of Prof. Lodge's further trials with Mr. Guthrie's two chief " per- cipieiits ". Whatever interpretation is to be put upon the facts reported,</page><page sequence="2">608 NEW BOOKS. it is not easy to see how they could have been more carefiully investigated than by Mr. G-uthrie, or afterwardls more rigidly tested than by the prac- tised experimental skill of Dr. Lodge. The other most notable piece among the varied contents of these Parts is the " Theory of Apparitions " set out at length (nearly 60 pp.) in vi. by Messrs. E. GuOrney and F. W. H. Myers. Here the authors, deferring the case of apparitions of the dead, seek to connect certain representative cases of " phantasmis of the living," through a graduated series of other related experiences as mean termis, with the simple experimental facts of " thought-transference," under one general conception of " Telepathy ". The mediation of the extremes is worked out with no little skill, and that the object is pursued with a strictlv scientific intention may be credited by readers of this Journal who are familiar with the work of one of the writers. It is not possible, how- ever, to regard the " physical theory " here set up to account for the facts as very satisfactory. Not to dwell upon the looseness of the conception of "Telepathy "-which does not seem verv well calculated to cover affections where distance of the supposed agent, beyond the recognised range of any of the senses, is the salient fact, with others, as in experimental " thought- transference," where, be the ordinary senses involved or not, distance is not a consideration-we are asked to suppose that one man may have (subjective) experience of a phantasm on occasion of what is being consciously or unconsciously) experienced by another, through " telepathic impulse " received from the active brain of tuis other by the higher centres of the brain of the first, whence it works down to the lower sense-centres implicated in the experience of the particular kind of phantasm. Before such a supposition can be dignified with the name of a " physical theory," some conceivable means of transference shouldl be suggested, but even more necessarv does it seem that some definite relationship of similarity should be made out between the mental experiences in agent and patient with which their brain-states correspond. Now very rarely, in the cases cited, is there any such relationship, nor is the real difficulty to any extent removed by all the clever piecing of evidence and sometimes subtle psycho- logical suggestion to be met with in this Report. The time to judge of the authors' whole case, and especially of the weight of the communicated testimony, will be when both are published at length in the book they promise on " Phantasms of the Living ". Meanwhile one is disposed to suggest that more valuable than any farther cumulation of such narratives as are here given, on not a few of which there might be a good deal to remark, would be somie very rigid experimentation with that remarkable person who can produce at will the effects upon other minds mentioned in passing at pp. 166, 171. He seems to be exactly the subject upon whom scientific determination of the facts of "telepathic impulse" could be made, or at least begun. On the Origin and Growth of Religion as illustrated by the Native Religions of Mexico and Peru. " Hibbert Lectures " delivered at Oxford and London, in April and May, 1884. By ALBERT RThVILLE, D.D., Pro- fessor of the Science of Religions at the College de France. Tranis- lated by PHILIP H. WICKSTEED, M.A. London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1884. Pp. 256. Three of these interesting (and very well translated) Lectures are occu- pied with the Mexican, and three with the Peruvian, religion ; the last of the six including also, from p. 240 to p. 256, a statement of general con- clusions drawn from the study of the two systems. The author, regarding botlh religions as purely autochthonous and uninfluenced from without,</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS. 609 fincls in the many analogies that can be traced between them and those of the Old World only proof of the similarity of conditions, internal and external, under which the invincible religious inmpulse in human nature has everywahere worked. Light is gained especially on the notion of Sacri- fice, which is found to be devoicl originally of all moral significance, though this came to be added later. Both religions confirm the view that spirituLal monotheism is a third and final stage reached through anthropomorphic polytheism from the first stage of all, animistic natuLre-worship, " of which fetichism is not the base,?as it has been callecl, buLt the consequence and application ". An Introduction to Mental Philosophy on the Inductive Method. By J. D. MORELL, A.M., LL.D., Author of History of Philosophy, &amp;c. (" Stewart's Educational Series"). London: W. Stewart, 1884. Pp. ix., 389. A modified reprint of the author's treatise of the same name publishedt in 1862, as is thus intimated at the end of the Preface :-" To render this edition more useful as an Examination Text-book, I have askedl the aid of a London University-graduate, and an experienced tutor, to eliminate from the text what may seem unlnecessary or confusing to the student, ancl to throw the whole into the form suited to the re- quirements of the London B.A. and other examinations in which psycho- logy is taken as a suLbject." The concession in point of "form" to the London postulant does not go beyond "elimination"; there is added, however, for his special behoof-whatever be the Degree, high or low, he has in view-a bulky Appendix (pp. cvii.) of actual Examination-papers of late years, and these (for greater convenience) not confined to the merely psychological matter of the treatise. The work, when it first appeared, had the merit of iimiporting into this country some novel ideas from Her- bartian sources. These might now have been referrecl to-as might also the work of physiologists-in somewhat different language than was natural in 1862 when the Preface, here reproduced withoult date, was written. Modern Theories of Philosophy and Religion. By JOHN TULLOCH, D.D., LL.D. Edinburgh and London: Blackwood, 1884. Pp. xiv., 444. A collection of nine essays (mostly reprints from the Fdinburgh Review) brought together as bearing on "the great question of contemporary thouLght . . . Is there a spirituLal world ? Is there a metaphysical as well as a physical basis of life? Is Reason or Soul, in other words, an entity and not a mere manifestation of lnervous force-a life behind all other life, and not merely the highest and most complex phase of natural life?" They are written with all the fluency to be expected of the author, and if with not quite the mild tolerance, the place and inanner of their first appearance shoulLd be borne in miind. "Auguste Comte and Posi- tivism," " Modern Scientific Materialism," " Pessimism," " Morality with- out Metaphysic," "1 Professor Ferrier and the Higher Philosophy," " Back to Kant ; or, Immanuel Kant and the Kantian Revival "-are among the subjects treated. Kant is approved of with a certain condescension, as froni some superior height which is nowhere very exactly defined, and with reservations. Of English thinkers, or of English originality, at least since the time of Hume, Dr. Tulloch has but a poor opinion, though he recog- nises a valiant champion of spiritual philosophy here and there and dletects ,of late a promise of better things.</page><page sequence="4">610 NEW BOOKS. Essati sur les Formes a priori de la SensibiliW. Par CHARLES DUNAN Agrege de Philosophie, Professeur de Philosophie au College Stanislas, Docteur es-lettres. Paris: Alcan, 1884. Pp. 227. A well-written essay, designed to show that space and time are not the a priori forms of sensibility for which Kant colntended, but rather uni- versal characteristics of our representations, springing from an anterior and more fLndamental form of mental activity. The question as to the true ultimate nature of space and time should not, as by Kant, be raised with the other question whether they are pure data of representation devoid of objective reality-as to which, the author first argues at length, no doubt can be maintained. Maintaining then (against M. Ribot) that the philosophical question as to the nature of space is really involved in the issues of the physio-psychological conflict between Nativism and Eni- piricism, and himself deciding for the middle position of Projectionism (after Volkmann, Donders, &amp;c.), he urges that the intuition of time is given simul- taneously with that of space, and that the two have accordingly one and the same origin. This origin is the one fundamental process of " multiplex unity and unified multiplicity" manifested in every act of mental repre- sentation-a process the two moments of which are familiar in science or reflective knowledge as analysis and synthesis. The process is not a law governing the phenomena of mind from without, but is a law inherent to thought itself; mind and thought being identical, and thought being one and multiplex because mind is one and multiplex, that is to say, imperfect. From the consideration then arising, how one and the same thought can give rise at once to the intuition of time and of space, or, in other words, of the Ego and the u-niverse, the author next passes to the problem of the categories, where he finds that judgment can only be the extension of the attributes of mind itself to the totality of external things. The doctrine so set forth is idealism, but, it is argued, not an idealism that involves the negation of an external world, in the only sense in which the existence of such can rightly be maintained. La Morale dans le Drame, l'Eipopee et le Roman. Par LuCIEN ARRE1AT. Paris: Alcan, 1884. Pp. 219. M. Janet and also Mr. Galton have urged the importance of utilising the rich store of psychological observation deposited in the masterpieces of literary art, and in this work the author employs the creations of the poet and novelist as a class of moral experiments that may serve to test the philosophical systems of morality. Whereas the moral agent of the philo- sophers is a pure abstraction, the dramatic character departs froin the concrete individual of real life no more and not otherwise than as in a scientific experiment actual bodies are placed in specially controlled cir- cumstances for the more exact study of particular aspects of their nature. From this point of view, the author, with easy movement over the literary field and at the same time with good philosophic insight, takes up in suc- cession " The Sources of our Moral Activity," " The Ends of Duty," "Moral Ob)liigation," "Moral Conflict," "The Sanction of Conscience," "Dramatic .1 ti-i " The Mechanism of Will," " The Sanction of a Future Life ". His own philosophic object is to show how a " positive morality" --based on a recognitinn of the intellectual craving or logical intuition resulting in the if 'I .1 i stice, as well as of those instincts of self-preserva- tion and reproduction that give rise to Egoism and Sympathy-should penetrate into the details of conduct, instead of remaining content, like the intuitionalist systems, with some vague and general rules of common sense.</page><page sequence="5">NEW BOOKS. 611 Emanuele Kctnt. Per CARLO CANTONI, Professore di Filosofia all' Univer- sita di Pavia. Volurne terzo. Milano : Hoepli, 1884. Pp. 436. Prof. Cantoni here completes the very careful and exhaustive exposition he has been making of Kant's whole philosophical doctrine: the earlier volumes were noted in MIND XVI. 601 ; XXX. 310. The present volume begins with " Philosophy of Religion " (pp. 1-161), treated in dependence upon the Ethical doctrine in vol. ii.; next takes up the Critick of Judgment (pp. 162-340); and brings together the various "Minor Doctrines" (Anthro- pology, Paedagogy, Philosophy of History) in short compass before con- cluding with a general survey of the whole field (pp. 381-436). This final chapter is marked by the same vigour of thought and expression that characterises the detailed criticism which, according to the plan of the book, follows upon each greater part of the exposition; but while the author is a thoroughly independent critic, as the " Kantian " with whom he likes to hold express dialogue often finds, he is at heart so much at one with the nmaster that in the central thought, as he takes it, of the systen-the supremacy of the piactical over the theoretic reason, however untrammeled this in its own sphere-he finds the idea which it most con- cerns the votaries of positive science at the present time, and especially in Italy, to ponder. To the physical realism and naturalistic pantheism pre- vailing in Italy, he desires to oppose a " metaphysical moralism " or " moral metaphysic " on Kantian lines, the working out of which is reserved for a special treatise to follow. Die Menschenlehre oder die Anthropologie. Von ROBERT GRASSMANN. Stet- tin: R. Grassmann, 1884. Pp. viii., 432. This volume is one of a connected series of works (already published or still to come) only one of which, Die Formenlehre, referred to by Mr. Venn in Symbolic Logic, seems thus Tar to have been made in any way known in this country; bhLt neither in the country of their origin do they appear to have drawn the attention of Fcschmdnner. This may be partly due to the fact that the writer (not to be confounded with H. Grassmann, author of Die linecle Ausdehnungslehre, 1844, and other works) is himself no profes- sional philosopher, but the busy editor (and also publisher) of no less than three newspapers of considerable circulation, one of them a daily. His manifold labours, all the same, have not prevented hiin from producing within a few years the various works mentioned incidentally in the present volume, Viz., Die Formenlehre oder MVJathematik, 1872 (1876 ?), transformed into Die TVissenslehre in a new edition to appear in the present year; Das Weltleben oder die Metaphysik, 1881 ; Das Tierleben oder die Physiologie der Tiere u. Menschen, 1883. Upon the present volume is announced to follow within the vear, Die Verkehrsle1hre, and later on will come Die Staatslehre in two parts (Die Rechtslehre and Die Reichslehre) ; all these last, from an(l including Die Menschenlehre, miaking up Die Sittenlehre, within the author's whole system of knowledge, to which he gives the general title of Die Gebdude des Wissens. Begun thus with Menschenlehre, the Sittenlehre is given out as 5th volume of the system, which suggests that the earlier parts of the system are ordered or designated somewhat otherwise than appears in the titles of the three earlier books quoted above ; but, however this may be, the notion is got of a single-handed effort of construction sufficiently ambitious in character. We must be content, for the present alnd till better-informed regarding its other parts, to have given a general notion of its range as far as this can be gathered from allusions in the present volume. As to the Menschenlehre it may be added that, after a long Intro- duction, which fills more than half the book-containing a demonstration</page><page sequence="6">612 NEW BOOKS. of the freedom of human spirits as real beings among the other real beings, not free, composing the system of nature (the demonstration being condensed, as the author claims, for the first time in history, into a definite mathe- matical formula); containing also a highly detailed theory of the relations of soul and spirit (distinguished from one another) to the nervous system- the doctrine falls into four sections entitled, Die Genusspflege, Die Arbeits- pflege, Die Gestaltungspflege, Die Bewusstseinspflege, dealing respectively with the sensual enjoyments depending on the contained visceral system, with the higher life of sense dependent on the containing bodily system with its active members subject to the controlling mind, with the inner elaboration of sense-impressions (in memory, idealisation, thought and science), and, lastly, with the manifestations of consciousness in general as a unity. The book abounds in assertions which it is little to describe as bizarre, and pre- sents confusions of thought from which the author might have been saved by a little more patient study of the "Herren Philosophen" whom he would leave behind. Yet it is impossible to read more than a few pages of his peculiar diction without recognising in him a strenuous and in his way acute thinker from whom there is not a little to be learned. Especially at the present tinme it is of interest to meet with one who is not content to proclaim in general terms the monadological conception but essays to work it out into all the details of a scientific theory of the world, life and mind. Hc&amp;ndbuch der Moral. Von Dr. ADOLF ROTHENBUCHER. Cottbus: Jaeger, 1884. Pp. 223. The author, who is at the head of an institution for the higher instruc- tion of girls in the town of Cottbus in Prussia and has distinguished hiimiself by his zeal and intelligence as an educator, brings here a wide range of philosophical reading and no little vigouir and independence of thought, with warmth and vivacity of written style, to the task of incul- cating a practical doctrine of morals. The book falls into four Parts: (1) "Foundations of Morality "; (2) " Conditions of Moral Action "; (3) "Morality and Virtues "; (4) " Education in Morality ". The aim is thoroughly practical-to edify and produce a disposition, more than to instruct; but throughout the treatise, many striking side-lights are thrown upon quiestions of moral theory. Most remarkable is the manner in which the author is able to comnbinie with strenuous recognition of plain scientific fact the maintenance of a high ideal. The phvsical and social bases of morality are brought specially into view in Part i. ; while in Part ii. " Freedom " and " Conscience " are discussed with sobriety and candour. Towards the close, the exposition becomes more suLffused with emotion, but the author's enthusiasm has always light shining through it. Biologische Probleme zugleich als Versuch zur Entwicklung einer rationellen Ethik. Von W. IH. ROLPH. Zweite, stark erweiterte Auflage. Leip- zig: Engelmnann, 1884. Pp. vi., 238. This second much-enlarged edition of a work which originally appeared in 1882, had for the most part been got ready by the author when he suc- cumbed to pulmonary disease in 1883; Prof. v. Gizycki of Berlin has attended to the revision of the remainder and seen the whole through the press. Son of an Einglish father (but of a German mother and born at Berlin in 1847, educated too in Germany and advanced to the position of Privat-docent of Zoology in the University of Leipsic before ill-health broke up his career), Dr. Rolph had first meant to write in English a merely critical discussion of some ethical views, with more especial re- ference to Mr. Spencer's Data of Ethics, but was led on to an independent investigation of what seemed to him the underlying biological questions,</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS. 613 and the result was published in German. The scope of his whole inquiry may be gathered fromi the titles of the eight chapters in which the book is disposed: (1) Doctrine of Evolution, (2) Suibjective Systems, (3) H. Spencer's Hedonism, (4) Problems of Nutrition, (5) Problenm of Perfection, (6) Problem of Propagation, (7) Animal or Natural Ethic, (8) Human Ethic. He completely accepts the theory of Evolution but departs in important respects from Darwin's presentation of it: Mr. Spencer is charged with not sufficiently excluding teleological conisiderations, utterly as these are to be abjured, according to the author, alike in the ethical and in the biological field. So resolute an attempt by a naturalist to deduce an ethical rule of conduct from the conditions of life has a peculiar interest, and critical examination is only deferred. Die Ethik des Protagoras u. deren zweifache Moralbegriindung kritisch unter- sucht von ADOLF HARPF. Heidelberg: Weiss, 1884. Pp. 72. A carefuil study of the ethical doctrines of Protagoras, undertaken not only as furnishing the necessary complement to his better-known theory of knowledge but as having a special interest in the present condition of ethical inquiry and affording the author the means of impressing some considerations which he thinks of importance for its future progress. The more immediate task consists in reconciling the apparently antagonistic " naturalism" " and " normalism " of the great sophist's ethical views as re- ported in the two Platonic dialogues Protagoras and Thecetetus respectively, and showing the connexion of the two-sided doctrine with his general philo- sophical position of Relativism. The lessoln to be impressed is carefulness in the use of descriptive rubrics in philosophy, to mark oppositions which when probed to the bottom turn out not to be real oppositions at all. A somnewhat elaborate parallel is drawn in the second part of the study (pp. 40-71) with the Kantian Ethics, which is found by the author to present a similar doubleness of aspect and to suggest the like precaution : not, how- ever, that in either case the deeper consistency is perfectly maintained, or that the Protagorean doctrine is to be elevated to the importance of Kant's achievement. Though marred in places by involution of statement, the study is to be commended as a thorough piece of work. Frequent acknow- ledgments are made to Grote, and the relation, among English thinkers, particularly of Hobbes and Hutcheson to Protagoras is well brought out. Der Pessimismus in Vergangenheit u. Gegenwart. Geschichtliches u. Kri- tisches von 0. PLUMACHER. Heidelberg: Weiss, 1884. Pp. xii., 355. Frau Plumacher's work is intended as a merely provisional substitute for the wide-ranging " History of Pessimism " that cannot, she thinks, be effectively written till the passionate excitement of present conflict has died down. It falls, after a short Introduction, into two parts. In the first (pp. 18-178) she traces the historical development of Pessimism, in AntiquLity (Oriental, Greek and Jewish), Christianity, Scielnce and Poetry, till it finally assumes perfected philosophical form in Hartmann, preceded by Schopenhauer and followed by Bahnsen, Mainlander and others. Part second (pp. 179-348) presents a critical survey of the multitude of recent attempts to discredit the philosophy of Pessimism from the point of view of Naturalistic, of Ethical, of Religious and of Panlogistic Optimism; all of them, according to the authoress, failing in one point or another to under- stand the historical genesis of the doctrine and its advance upon the earlier and less developed forms. In conclusion, while allowing the possibility that at some later stage of mental evolution the metaphysical conditions of Pessimism (as regards beginning and end of the world-process and the re- lation of being and appearance) may undergo transformation, she ex-</page><page sequence="8">614 NEW BOOKS. presses her conviction that, as an inductively reasoned judgment upoIl the worth of things as actually experienced, Hartmann's eudaemonological Pessimism is the absolutely highest form that philosophical doctrine can assume. Genie, u. Wahnsinn. Eine psychologische Untersuchung von Dr. PAUL RADESTOCK. Breslau: Trewendt, 1884. Pp. vii., 78. The author, whose previous works~ Schiaf u. Traura and Die Gewuhnung u. ihre WVichtigkeit fier die Erziehung have been noticed in MIND XVI. 588 ; XXVI. 315, takes here as the subject of a third psychological monograph that relation of Genius and Madness which has not only ofteln suggested itself to common sense, but in later times been categorically asserted by various thinkers and argued more especially by alienists of distinction. Within limited compass (pp. 1-52), but with a rather elaborate support of confirmatory references and illustrative citations (pp. 53-78), the subject is first treated on a basis of biographical facts, classified and critically sifted, next touched upon physiologically, and then discussed in its psychological aspects. After all reservations made upon the different lines, the author comes to the conclusion that the relation asserted must be allowed, and in view of their psychological affinities as traced has little to suggest as marking the difference between the genius and the madman except that "by their fruits shall ye know them ". The greater the mental affinity, and the more clearly established the danger of passage from the one class to the other, the more important, he urges as the moral of his inquiry, is it that by careful educational training the genius should be strengthened to escape the personal consequences that lie so close to the performance of grand achievements for the race. Psychologisch-dsthetische Essays. Von Dr. SUSANNA RUBINSTEIN. Zweite Folge. Mit dem Bildnisse der Verfasserin. Heidelberg: Winter, 1884. Pp. 278. The authoress published a first series of Essays, of similar character to these, in 1878, which drew considerable attention ; one of them, "The Life of the Senses," setting forth the findamental idea that varieties of mental habit, as consciously felt or manifested outwardly, are to be traced back for nations and individuals alike to differences of sense-endow- ment. The subjects of the present series are-" Fortunes of Presentations," " Time and Space," " Kinds of Movement," " Psychologv of the Sexes," " Passion and Affection," " Natural History of Wit," " Greek Phantasy," "Indian Phantasy". The Essays show sound knowledge of the present state of psychological science, with much delicacy of observation. Allgemeine Grundziege der Ethnologie. Von ADOLF BASTIAN, Prof. Dr. Prolegomena zur Begriundung einer naturwissenschaftlichen Psv- chologie auf dem Material des Volkergedankens. Berlin: Dieterich Reimer, 1884. Pp. xxiv., 144. Six chapters on " Geographical Provinces," " Tools," " Property," " Mar- riage," " Law," "Religion," with exhaustive supplemnent of supporting authorities, designed anew to impress the untiring author's conception of psychology as needing for its scientific basis a systematic induction of ethnological facts.
