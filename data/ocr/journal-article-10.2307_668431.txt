<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Prehistory of the Australian New Guinea Highlands SUSAN AND RALPH BULMER University of Auckland T HIS paper is a first, and avowedly speculative, survey of evidence from several disciplines bearing on the past of the Highlands of Australian New Guinea. It includes a brief summary of recent archeological discoveries which will be published more fully elsewhere.' We make four main points: (1) Stratified evidence from two excavated rock-shelter sites indicates an early population in the Highlands which lacked neolithic stone tools and which, for a number of reasons, may be regarded as possessing a hunting and gathering economy. (2) Findings at the same two sites, together with unstratified prehistoric artifacts from various parts of the Highlands, suggest that ground-edged len- ticular-sectioned axe or adze blades were introduced to Central New Guinea earlier than the quadrangular- (or planilateral-) sectioned axe blades character- istic of much of the region at the time of European contact; and that there have been at least two main phases of agricultural settlement of the area. Ethno- botanical considerations also suggest the likelihood of at least two main phases of agricultural settlement. (3) Archeological, physical anthropological and linguistic evidence all at present suggest a continuity of population within the Highlands from early times, with local readjustments following technological introductions and, possibly, the intrusion of small groups of people. There is little positive evi- dence for large-scale immigration into the Highlands subsequent to their first settlement. (4) Ethnological, ecological, linguistic, physical anthropological and arche- ological evidence all suggest that within the Highlands the Eastern sub-region (i.e. the Asaro Valley and areas to the East) has had a rather different history from the Western. For our present purposes, the Highlands of Australian New Guinea are taken to comprise the Eastern, Western and Southern Highlands Administra- tive Districts, together with those parts of the Bismarck, Schrader and Central Ranges above 2,000 feet which lie on the northern fringe of the Highlands Districts and fall in the Madang and Sepik Districts. We are not concerned with the Telefomin region farther west in the mountain chain, or with the "Kukukuku" territory of the Kratke Range farther East. In this region of approximately 28,000 square miles live rather more than three-quarters of a million people, much the greater part of this population dwelling at altitudes between 4,000 and 8,000 feet. Populations between 3,500 and 2,000 feet are very sparse. In many fringe areas of the Highlands there are large uninhabited tracts at this altitude. The prehistorian's justification for isolating the Highlands as an area of study rests on: 39</page><page sequence="2">40 New Guinea: The Central Highlands (1) The relative ecological homogeneity of this region and the contrast it offers to surrounding areas. (2) The finding that nearly all of its contemporary languages are geneti- cally related and are more closely related to each other than to any language spoken outside this area, implying some measure of overall historical continuity in the region. (3) The wide-ranging continuities evident in the contemporary cultures of the region. (4) The physical and genetic continuities demonstrated by anthropometric and serological studies among the contemporary populations of the region. THE ANTIQUITY OF MAN IN AUSTRALASIA The archeological evidence, to be discussed below, suggests considerable antiquity for the occupation of the Highlands. However, since C14 dates are not yet available, this cannot be taken for granted on archeological grounds alone. We may therefore consider evidence from other quarters which makes it reasonable to expect a lengthy period of human history in New Guinea. There is now reasonably firm archeological evidence that man was in Australia at least 12,000 years ago (Mulvaney 1962:137), while most authori- ties agree that it is likely that he was there several thousand years before that, as is suggested by less conclusive archeological findings (Mulvaney 1961:64). The drowning of Torres Strait and consequent disappearance of the land bridge between New Guinea and Australia may be estimated to have occurred between 8,000 and 5,500 years ago during the Flandrian transgression (J. N. Jennings, personal communication). If man was present in Australia well be- fore the land bridge disappeared, it is hard to believe that he was not also in New Guinea (Reference in this paper is made to map Ic, p. 306.) At the same time, recent assessments of serological and anthropometric data on contemporary Australian Aborigine and Papuan populations suggest a very different ancestry (Macintosh et al. 1958:190). No firm linguistic evidence for a relationship between Australian and New Guinea languages has yet been reported. Although a time factor of 8,000 years plus may rule out the possi- bility of reconstructing linguistic relationships even where these, in fact, ex- isted, it seems unlikely that the Australian and New Guinea populations could have diverged so much in genetic constitution in such a brief period by normal evolutionary processes. Three possible explanations may be suggested for this divergence. These are: (1) That Australians and Papuans derive from different populations enter- ing the two land-masses separately at early dates, before the land-bridge disap- peared. (2) That Australians and Papuans derive in the very distant past from the same basic stock, or differing combinations of the same stocks, as postulated by the Birdsell (1948) hypothesis, but that the process of local differentiation was well advanced before the geographical link of the land-bridge was removed.</page><page sequence="3">The Prehistory 41 (3) That, whether or not Australia and New Guinea were originally settled by related populations, New Guinea has been subjected to extensive immigra- tion and population movement in recent millennia, since the separation of the land-masses. Hence no local population has so far been identified which has not been significantly affected by these later immigrants. Whichever of these explanations should ultimately prove correct, the prob- ability seems high that man has been present in New Guinea for at least ten thousand years. We may also assume that the earliest occupants of both re- gions were pre-agricultural hunters and gatherers, since this chronology for early settlement places them well before the time posited for the beginnings of agriculture in southern Asia, whence they must ultimately have derived. NON-ARCHEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE PREHISTORY OF THE HIGHLANDS Linguistic. S. E. Wurm's survey of Highlands languages is discussed elsewhere in this symposium. We may note three very important historical implications of this study, as described in earlier publications: (1) The common historical origin of all languages of the Highlands except for a few spoken in fringe areas, and their apparent lack of close relationship to any languages spoken outside the region: this is an index of overall historical continuity within the Highlands. Wurm places 52 of the 60 indigenous lan- guages of the Highlands, spoken by over 98.5% of the population, in a single language phylum; 47 of these, spoken by approximately 96% of the population, he places in a single language stock (Wurm 1961c, 1962a, 1962d). Speakers of the Highlands Stock occupy all the main valley systems, to- gether with some fringe regions. Wurm divides the stock into five language families, each of which is located in a discrete and continuous area. Of five Highlands Phylum languages not included in the Stock, three mu- tually related ones are spoken in the Bismarck-Schrader Ranges on the north- ern border of the Western Highlands, while two others, not closely related to each other, are found on the southwestern and southern fringes. Wurm is satisfied that there are distant connections between the Highlands Phylum and Pavaia (spoken by 2,000 people in the Purari Valley on the south- eastern fringe of the Highlands), the Huon Peninsula group of languages, the Binandere Family of the coast and hinterland of the Northern District, and the Ndani Family of the Baliem Valley highland region of Irian Barat (Wurm 1962b:422). (2) The diversity of Highlands languages indicates a long period for their evolution from a common source. Wurm's tentative lexicostatistical dating gives a time depth of up to 5,100 years for the Highlands Stock (Wurm 1961a: 22). Elsewhere (1960:128) he suggests a time span of, on the average, 3-4,000 years for the separation of languages of different families within the group, and up to 6,400 years for the Highlands Phylum (1961a: 23). If any reliance can be placed on these datings, they would place the an- cestral language of the Phylum at a period when agriculture is very unlikely</page><page sequence="4">42 New Guinea: The Central Highlands to have developed. There is, of course, no reason to assume that the ancestral language was necessarily spoken within the Highlands region. At the same time, archeological evidence makes quite plausible a period of 6,000 or more years of human occupation in the Highlands. (3) Numerical strengths and geographical dispersal both of contemporary speech communities, and of speakers of closely related dialects and languages (see Wurm 1961c), suggest that the larger Western Highlands language groups have dispersed and diversified more recently than the Eastern Highlands groups. The first and third points require further comment (Robbins 1963a:51). Dyen (1956:613) postulated that "the probabilities of different reconstructed migrations are in an inverse relation to the number of reconstructed language movements that each requires," concluding (Dyen:625) that "determinable positive migrations are from complex areas to uniform areas." Robbins (1963a) has already drawn the obvious inference, that the Eastern Highlands have been occupied by speakers of languages of the Highlands Stock longer than the Western, and that the overall direction of migration has been from East to West. This plausible argument rests on two unproven assumptions. The first is that the proto-language, or its closely related derivatives, was in fact spoken within the Highlands, and not exclusively in some other region where unrelated or very distantly related languages are now spoken. It is at least possible that speakers of two or more different languages, or groups of languages, all ulti- mately derived from a proto-language spoken outside the area, have entered the Highlands by different routes, possibly at different times, and that their descendants have occupied different areas. The second assumption of this hypothesis is that the different sub-areas of the Highlands have, over several thousand years, offered approximately equal chances of viability to all speech-communities. This may well be true; but it is quite conceivable that genetic factors, local ecological differences, technological changes brought about by local innovation or derived from contacts with out- side groups or the interplay of those factors have caused speech communities in different areas to fluctuate in size and area of distribution at quite different rates. Folk tradition among some Western Highlands peoples (Medlpa, Kyaka, Enga) suggests that these contemporary groups have recently expanded at the expense of other, possibly related, peoples. Further, Salisbury's (1962c) recent account of bilingualism and community changes of linguistic affiliation, on the boundary of Language Families II and III (See Map II) also raises doubt con- cerning assumptions of long-term viability of speech-communities, even where these are neither physically exterminated nor subject to political domination and absorption. Finally, this hypothesis takes no account of the presence of the five lan- guages which are of the Highlands Phylum but not of the Highlands Stock, on the northern and southern fringes of the Highlands. In terms of Dyen's theory, the Eastern Highlands can be regarded as the most probable homeland of the</page><page sequence="5">The Prehistory 43 Highlands languages only if the distantly related fringe languages are left out of consideration. Thus the fact that the Eastern sub-region is, in terms of its languages, the area of greatest apparent historical continuity within the Highlands, remains as a very significant finding; but without archeological support, the theory that all contemporary Highlands groups derive from an Eastern Highlands source can be considered as only one of a number of possible interpretations of the evidence. Lastly, we must note that linguistic evidence cannot at present suggest whether or not speakers of a language or languages, ancestral to contemporary ones were the first occupants of the Highlands, for languages spoken by earlier populations may have been completely superseded by languages ancestral to those spoken in the Highlands today. Cultural. Systematic attempts to reconstruct the past-either of the Highlands as a whole or of limited areas within it-on the basis of ethnological data are so far lacking. At least one important current research project, the CONGS Micro-evolution study among four peoples of the Eastern Highlands (Watson 1963), which combines ethnological with linguistic, physical anthropological, and ecological enquiries, is specifically oriented to this end. Also, several au- thors have made interesting suggestions on the basis of limited studies, either of one people only (e.g., Vicedom and Tischner 1943/48:I, 18-20), or in the course of wider comparative studies which include restricted consideration of Highlands ethnology (e.g., Speiser 1946:26-32; Riesenfeld 1950:423-42, 641, 669-70; Wirz 1952b: 28-9; H*ltker 1940/41:725f; Schmitz 1962:114). However, some preliminary comments of a general nature may be made. Certain continuities in technology and economy in the Highlands are discussed below. Here we may merely note: (1) That no contemporary Highlands people (i.e., language or dialect group) has been reported which is socially isolated, that is, which does not exchange goods and intermarry to at least a limited extent with its neighbors within the Highlands. Data on relations between fringe Highlands groups and their neighbors outside the Highlands are at present scanty, but there is evi- dence that exchange of goods occurred quite generally, while in at least some cases intermarriage has been reported, e.g., by Gusinde (1958:835, 839-40) for the Schrader mountain people with the Ramu Valley dwellers. This is impor- tant, since, if the present is any indication of the past, it shows the way in which changes in genetic composition of Highlands populations, and in tech- nology and other spheres of culture could readily take place.2 (2) Notwithstanding the general pattern of communication between High- lands groups, there are cultural sub-divisions within the Highlands which coincide roughly with the main linguistic subgroups; as Read (1954a: 12) has pointed out, these mark off in particular the peoples living to the east of the Chimbu and Mai-Asaro watershed from those to the west. For the purposes of</page><page sequence="6">44 New Guinea: The Central Highlands this paper this is the line taken to divide the "Eastern Highlands" from the "Western Highlands," although it does not coincide with the boundary of the Eastern and Western Highlands Administration Districts. Thus, in terms of settlement pattern, the Eastern Highlands speakers of Wurm's language families I and II are characterized by nucleated villages or hamlets; all groups further west, including the groups in language families III, IV and V, are characterized by scattered homestead settlements, each home- stead consisting of one or more dwellings and occupied by an elementary or polygynous compound family, generally with cleared ceremonial grounds pro- viding the focus for local group activities. The Karam and some related peoples of the Bismarck-Schrader mountains live in very small hamlets, each consisting of one large multi-room house with possibly one or two smaller adjacent struc- tures, the whole complex normally occupied by an extended family. In general terms, local variations in dress, other aspects of material culture, and cult activities, appear to be regionally definable in ways on the whole con- sistent with language family or sub-family boundaries (cf. Read 1954a). Canni- balism was restricted, at the time of European contact, to a number of societies speaking languages of families I and II, though not all societies within these language groups were cannibals. The consumption of betel-nut was restricted to societies of the Eastern Highlands located to the North-East of Ramu- Purari Divide. Certain items of material culture with a restricted distribution are discussed in section 4.1. below. (3) Folk-histories among at least some of the more numerous Western Highlands peoples (Medlpa, Enga, Chimbu) describe population movements consistent with the fairly recent expansion of these groups as posited on the basis of linguistic evidence. Cultural evidence thus appears to support the linguistic evidence that the Eastern and Western Highlands have had significantly different histories, a finding which is further supported by physical anthropological and ecological data. Physical Anthropological. Serological and anthropometric studies in the High- lands (Ivinskis et al. 1956; Semple et al. 1956; Macintosh et al. 1958; Kariks et al. 1959; MacLennan et al. 1960; Champness et al. 1960; Walsh et al. 1960; Watson et al. 1961) indicate both genetic variation between speech-communi- ties and continuities between neighboring Highlands populations. These find- ings are consistent both with a hypothesis of general common origin and with information available concerning the overall pattern of intermarriage (re- stricted by geographical distance and sometimes, possibly, by language bound- aries) between adjacent groups. The main contrast so far discovered within the Highlands lies in the frequencies of the S gene, which show a gradient from East to West, the lowest recorded being 0.0437 at Kainantu (Watson et al. 1961), the highest, 0.2065 being at Wabag (Macintosh et al. 1958). It is of interest that the only sudden drop in the gradient is between Chimbu and Goroka, i.e., on the boundary of Wurm's Language Families II and III, and of</page><page sequence="7">The Prehistory 45 the Eastern and Western Sub-regions as defined in this paper (Kariks et al. 1959:235). Macintosh (1958:193) has suggested that present data may be interpreted most simply as evidence that an ancient and fairly homogeneous population within the Highlands-and indeed New Guinea as a whole-was modified by later intrusions through contact with more recent populations in adjacent lowland valleys, some of whom may in fact have penetrated the Highlands. The same author (Macintosh 1960: 292) suggests that evident contrasts in skin pigmentation between close relatives in Western Highlands groups may be explained in terms of stratification of populations, although he also proposes the alternative explanatory hypothesis "that a disadvantageous mutation of depigmentation through stages of dark to medium to light occurs within local- ized groups." Walsh (in Macintosh et al. 1958:191) postulates, on the basis of S gene frequencies, the infiltration of a later group of people either eastward or westward along the Highlands ridge. The suggestion is consistent with the sim- plest interpretation of the linguistic evidence if only the Highlands Stock is considered, but difficult to reconcile with the more complex interpretations required in considering the whole Highlands Phylum. There is no single respect in which the Highlands populations collectively are marked off in their genetic or physical characteristics from all other New Guinea populations so far studied, since they fall, in general terms, well within the range hitherto reported for New Guinea as a whole. It is, nevertheless, impossible at present to point to any specific New Guinea group outside the Highlands to which the Highlanders can be closely related in terms of their overall pattern of gene frequencies. Macintosh, Walsh and their collaborators, whose enquiries in the Western Highlands provide the most substantial con- tribution to blood group studies in this region to date, point out; "the possibility still remains that gradients will be found between Wabag natives and the natives of sub-areas within adjacent districts, but this will require the examination of very large numbers in each of the adjacent districts. At present there is no indication as to which district or sub-area should receive attention" (Macintosh et al. 1958:191). Significantly, it appears from a recent study (Rieckmann et al. 1961) that the blood groups of the linguistically and culturally very different Telefomin people of the Central Range west of the Highlands area are very unlike those of the Western Highlanders. Ethno-botanical. Discussion here is restricted to some of the more important cultivated or semi-cultivated food plants. Wild plants of possible significance in human diet are considered briefly below. Within the Highlands herein delimited the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is much the most important crop at all altitudes between approximately 3,500 and 9,000 feet (cf. Brookfield 1962 and the same author's contribution to the present symposium). Only on the swampy shores of Lake Kutubu and along the Mubi River on the Southern fringe at 2,600 feet and below where sago (Metroxylon sp.) is the staple, has sweet potato not been reported as the domi-</page><page sequence="8">46 New Guinea: The Central Highlands nant food-plant (Williams 1940:34-5). Above 6,500 feet the only crop besides sweet potato which really flourishes is the semi-cultivated nut pandanus (sev- eral species including, probably Pandanusjiulianettii and P. brosimos) though small quantities of sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum), taro (Colocasia spp.), and bananas or plantains (Musa spp.) are grown up to 7,000 feet or slightly higher in some areas. J. B. Watson (personal communication) has recently established that the legume, Pueraria lobata, which bears a large edible root, is widely cultivated in the Australian Highlands at altitudes up to at least 6,500 feet. Although this is today a crop of only marginal importance it may have had very considerable significance at an earlier period, before the intro- duced staple root crops were well established. Below 6,000 feet taro, sugar cane, bananas and Pueraria all do reasonably well, while below 5,500 feet yams (Dioscorea spp.) and winged beans (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus) also come into prominence, though at all Highlands altitudes yams, taro, and Pueraria take much longer periods to mature than sweet potato, and the first two at least produce much smaller crops per acre (cf. Barrau 1958:27-31). There is no evidence for the utilization of sago, above 3,000 feet. This is dis- cussed further below. Of these crops, sugar cane, is now believed to be a New Guinea cultigen (Warner 1962). Bananas of the Eumusa series, which include the most impor- tant traditional varieties of the Highlands, are believed to be an early intro- duction from Malaysia (Simmonds 1959: Chap. V, XI), while those of the Australimusa series are thought to have originated in New Guinea or the Solomon Islands (Simmonds 1959: Chap. IV). Ethnological considerations suggest that yams and taro, which are also assumed on botanical grounds to be Southern or South-East Asian cultigens (Burkill 1951a, 1951b; Spier 1951), are also of considerable antiquity in New Guinea, and therefore potentially also in the Highlands. We have no good evidence for the antiquity of the winged bean (Psophocarpus) in New Guinea: presumably it reached the island from S.E. Asia, and Burkill (1935: II 1819) argues for its relatively recent introduc- tion into that region. The sweet potato, however, is now postulated, on very strong evidence, to be of American origin (Nishiyama 1963, Yen 1963). These findings, coupled with the evidence for the recency of its introduction by Span- ish and Portuguese voyagers in the Philippines and Indonesia (Conklin 1963), indicate that it is almost certainly a relatively recent arrival in New Guinea. It is indeed possible that it is a post-Spanish introduction and thus not more than 350 years old in New Guinea. Even if it is regarded as an introduction via Polynesia, which does not seem probable from the botanical evidence (Yen 1963), it still cannot be reckoned as more than 2,000 years old in New Guinea. The apparent absence of the plant in parts of Western Melanesia in the 19th century also suggests both a Western origin and a recent date for its acquisition by Papuans. The speed with which other cultivated plants are known to have spread in New Guinea is further indication of the possible recency of sweet potato culti- vation: tobacco had diffused to the most remote parts of New Guinea between</page><page sequence="9">The Prehistory 47 the 17th century and first direct European contact in the 19th and 20th cen- turies. Maize (Zea mays) and manioc (Manihot spp.), two plants introduced to Melanesia in the 19th century, had both apparently found their way into the Highlands before direct contact in the early 1930's (Vicedom &amp; Tischner 1943/ 48: I:181) and have spread further and assumed economic importance with re- markable rapidity in the last three decades. Parts of the Highlands offer favorable conditions for flowering and seed- formation of sweet potato, and thus for the emergence of new strains (Yen 1960:371). The large number of strains known to certain Highlands peoples- Reay (1959a: 10) records 65 named varieties among the Kuma of the Wahgi Valley-is thus not evidence for antiquity of cultivation. In view of the probable recency of sweet potato cultivation in the Highlands, the density of population which this crop supports at 6,000 feet and above, where no other garden crop really flourishes, is also extremely significant. There are 200 or more people to the square mile in at least three parts of the Western Highlands at this altitude (Mt. Hagen, Upper Lai Valley, Upper Chimbu Valley). We may therefore reasonably infer from present data on the ethnobotany of Highlands crop plants: (1) that early agriculturalists in the Highlands are likely to have relied on taro and/or Pueraria and/or bananas, and possibly, in areas below 5,500 feet, yams; (2) that these crops are unlikely to have supported anrything approaching present population densities at between 5,000 and 6,000 feet, and can only have supported very sparse populations at higher altitudes; and (3) that major redistributions of population, particularly in the Western Highlands, have taken place since the introduction of intensive sweet potato cultivation. However, one qualification must be entered: if significant fluctuations in climate have occurred within the period of agriculture, some crops could have been successfully cultivated at higher altitudes than at present. It is not known whether the climatic fluctuations ascribed to other parts of the Southern hemi- sphere within the last two millennia will need to be taken into account in New Guinea. Both H. C. Brookfield (personal communication) and R. G. Robbins (personal communication) are skeptical concerning the possible significance of such fluctuations in montane New Guinea. Domestic animals. The Highlanders had three non-indigenous domestic animals at the time of first European contact: the pig (Sus scrofa), the dog (Canis familiaris), and the fowl (Gallus gallus). Although published zoological studies of these creatures in the Highlands are lacking and ethnological infor- mation concerning them contributes little to the reconstruction of the past, it is necessary to discuss them briefly, since the pig is of such extreme importance in all contemporary Highlands cultures (cf. Reay 1959a: 20), while the dog also has an important place in many of them. The pig is present throughout the Highlands as a domestic animal, and is</page><page sequence="10">48 New Guinea: The Central Highlands probably present in feral state in all forest areas of any size below 5,500 feet, and possibly also at higher altitudes. Our excavations described below provide clear evidence of pigs during an earlier but still almost certainly agricultural phase of Western Highlands history, while it is apparently not found in the earliest pre-neolithic levels excavated. However, there is as yet no clear indica- tion of its probable date of introduction either to the Highlands or to New Guinea as a whole. The dog is kept throughout the Highlands as a pet, is frequently eaten, and has some importance as a hunting animal among groups who pursue game in forest or alpine grasslands. Hunting dogs seen by the authors in the Western Highlands include many which are similar in appearance to the feral dog of the Mt. Giluwe area. There is no firm evidence for the antiquity of the dog in New Guinea, nor can evidence from Australia throw much light on the problem. In spite of superficial similarities between the Giluwe feral dog and the Australian dingo, recent studies suggest that they are of very different ancestry (N. W. G. Macintosh, personal communication). In any case, the earliest archeological record of dingo, from Fromm's Landing, South Australia (Mulvaney 1960: 153), is dated by C14 as 1,000-1,200 B.C. (D. J. Mulvaney, personal commu- nication), i.e., several millennia after the probable disappearance of the Sahul land-bridge. The fowl was known only in certain parts of the Highlands at the time of first European contact, and ethnologists' reports suggest that it had been intro- duced to some areas very recently (Reay 1959a: 6, Meggitt 1958a: 298). Environmental (geochronology and ecology). Although studies of geological his- tory for this region within the possible period of human occupation have only just begun, ecological data throw further light on past agricultural activity in the Highlands and also indicate at least the possibility that earlier non-agricul- tural populations could have gained a livelihood there. Hunters and Gatherers in the Highlands? The argument that hunters and gatherers could have been present in the Highlands rests on (i) the assumption (discussed above) that they were present in some parts of New Guinea at an early date (at a reasonable guess 10,000 BP or earlier), and (ii) the likelihood that the area could have provided adequate food resources for them from early post-glacial times onward. Although evidence of glaciation in several parts of the Highlands has been reported (Reiner 1960; J. N. Jennings, personal communication), the overall environmental history of the region in post-glacial times is at present a subject for speculation. It may be possible, as Gilliard and Lecroy (1961:19-20) have suggested, to extrapolate post-glacial chronology from other parts of the world and estimate on this basis that 10 or 11,000 years ago (which would be within the likely period of human occupation of New Guinea) the upper tree-line was 4 to 5,000 feet lower than its present general altitude (11,000-12,000 feet above sea level), with a corresponding down-grading and compression of other eco- logical zones; but this needs local confirmation. Even if so recent a date for</page><page sequence="11">The Prehistory 49 glacial activity in New Guinea is accepted, this still allows a period of perhaps 8,000 years within which climatic conditions have permitted human settlement in the Highlands; there is as yet no local evidence to rule out the possibility of a much longer period. Ecological studies indicate the kind of resources which a hunting and gathering population in the Highlands could have utilized within recent mil- lennia. It is now believed that the Highlands were forest-covered, apart from small areas of Phragmites swamp and alpine grassland before man's agricultural activities created the large areas of garden land, bush fallow and grassland which dominate the Eastern Highlands and the valley areas and lower moun- tain slopes of the Western Highlands (Robbins 1963a, 1963b). The resources to be considered are therefore mainly those of the forest zones. Except possibly at the very highest altitudes, all contemporary forest zones of the Highlands contain game and edible plants and seeds which could very probably support small populations, if they had the necessary technology. The nut-bearing pandanus species already referred to are present in the lower montane beech (Nothofagus), mixed, and mixed oak forest zones between 10,000 and 5,500 feet, and are still today an important subsidiary food resource to high altitude horticultural populations. The mixed forest between 8,000 and 6,000 feet also contains Elaeocarpus trees which bear nuts with edible kernels. The lower montane mixed oak forest (at altitudes between 7,500 and 3,000 feet, but characteristically between 7,000 and 4,000 feet) contains the oak-like Castanopsis trees which produce prolific quantities of small nuts which present- day Highlanders eat both raw and cooked, a number of other trees, including Elaeocarpus, Sloanea, Finschia and Sterculia species, which bear edible nuts or seeds, vines with edible fruits (e.g., a cucurbit which is probably Trichosanthes), wild edible tubers (apparently Dioscorea sp. or spp.), many trees, shrubs and ferns the foliage of which is edible, and many kinds of edible fungi. The acorns of the "true" oaks themselves (Quercus s.l.) could presumably provide a staple food if techniques of processing were understood, but we have no records of their consumption in New Guinea. A wild Pueraria, of different species to the cultivated P. lobata, which bears an edible root now considered only as a famine crop, is present in some parts of the Highlands in bush fallow and grassland areas at about 5,000 feet above sea level, but it is not known if this plant is also present in undisturbed forest at this altitude. In the lower Baiyer Valley and some other fringe areas of the Highlands, sago (Metroxylon sp.) is present and utilized up to 3,500 feet, but it is uncertain to what extent the occurrence of the trees at this altitude must be attributed to their planting by man.3 Seed-bearing breadfruit (Artocarpus sp.), cultivated up to an altitude of about 5,000 feet, is also reported as a forest tree below about 3,000 feet. How- ever, there is some possibility that this plant is not indigenous to New Guinea (Barrau 1961:52). Arboreal and terrestrial game may be considered separately, since the tech- nology required in hunting differs for the two.4 Over 125 species of birds are known from the montane and lower montane forest, at between approximately</page><page sequence="12">50 New Guinea: The Central Highlands 4,000 and 12,000 feet. The commonest arboreal species of any size are the big doves (Ducula spp., Reinwardtoena and Gymnophaps), which are present at all altitudes. Below 3,000 or 4,000 feet, hornbills (Rhyticeros), cockatoos (Caca- tua), large parrots (Larius), and crows (Gymnocorvus) are also plentiful. Larger arboreal mammals present in the lower montane forest up to about 8,000 feet include tree kangaroos (Dendrolagus sp.) and giant rats (e.g. Uromys spp. and Mallomys), while cuscus (Phalanger spp.) and ring-tail possum (Pseudocheirus spp.) are found at all altitudes to 11,000 feet. Tree-dwelling reptiles present to at least 5,000 feet include small pythons (Chrondropython sp.), Boigas (Boiga spp.) and lizards (Gonyocephalus spp. and many smaller kinds). These arboreal creatures are taken by present-day Highlanders with snares, with bow and arrow, and by hand. Judging from our observations in the Schrader Mountains, arboreal mammals are most frequently captured by hand. Fire is used to smoke animals out of hollow trees. The bow is particularly important in bird hunting, though surprising numbers of species are taken with snares and even by hand. Of perhaps equal importance to the bow to present- day hunters is the axe. This greatly facilitates both general movement in the forest and tree-climbing, which is a very necessary part of the hunt. It is used for clearing obstacles and fashioning ladders, climbing poles, and blinds.5 Indigenous terrestrial fauna of the forest include a number of relatively small birds, mammals and reptiles, as well as cassowaries (Casuarius spp.) which are at present found in the Schrader Mountains up to 8,500 feet though in most of the Highlands they appear to be absent above 6,000 feet; brush-tur- keys (Aepypodius, possibly Talegalla, and at fringe altitudes Megapodius) which are mainly important for their eggs; a terrestrial cuscus (Phalanger sp.) present in some areas between 6,000 and 8,000 feet and possibly at higher and lower altitudes; and small wallabies (an animal which is probably Dorcopsis is present in some areas to at least 8,000 feet; Thylogale has not apparently been recorded in the Highlands above about 4,000 feet, though it is known at con- siderably higher altitudes in some other parts of New Guinea). Wallabies may well be present, or previously have been present, at considerably higher alti- tudes, since they have been reported up to 11,000 feet in some other parts of New Guinea. The bow and arrow is probably less important in taking terrestrial game than it is for hunting arboreal creatures. Springs are used for cassowaries and many smaller animals and birds. Log-fall traps are used in some parts of the Western Highlands to take the introduced feral pig and certain smaller crea- tures. Wallabies are captured in pit-traps, both in the Schrader Mountains and on Mt. Hagen. Dogs are employed in hunting wallabies and the terrestrial cuscus. Although the bow is used in hunting larger game, and especially pig, the spear, either thrown or thrust, is also a very important weapon in pig and cassowary hunting. In forest areas relatively free of undergrowth, short fences or screens can be employed." Apart from the forest, other natural ecological zones of smaller size are exploited by present-day Highlanders and could presumably have been utilized</page><page sequence="13">The Prehistory 51 from earliest times. Terrestrial mammals of unidentified species are hunted (with dogs) in the natural alpine grassland above 11,000 feet. Rails and other birds are snared in marshy areas. Bats and small birds (Collocalia spp.) are disturbed in caves and knocked down in narrow corridors and entrances by hunters with brush-like sticks. Fish are present, but not plentiful, in Highlands-rivers and streams. Eels are ubiquitous, though nowhere very numerous, and are taken with wicker or bark traps. Otherwise, only small catfish, sunfish, gobies, and so forth, are reported at altitudes above 4,000 feet. Probably much more important as a minor food resource, both today and in the past, are frogs, which are very plentiful in many parts of the Highlands (cf. Tyler 1961). Finally, we may note that many kinds of insects, or their larvae, and other invertebrates are included in the diet of present-day Highlanders. The most highly valued are probably the larvae of certain kinds of longicorn beetle, found in dead timber, and the larvae.of certain bees and wasps. Land snails are eaten in the Schrader mountains. If climatic conditions in the Highlands are assumed to have been much the same at the time of first human occupation as they are today, we may argue for the possibility that all altitudinal zones were exploitable, though the lower montane mixed oak forest, below approximately 6,000 feet, is likely to have offered richer possibilities than zones at higher altitudes, particularly if the bow and some reasonably efficient axe were lacking. However, hunters and gather- ers are frequently characterized by large and ecologically heterogeneous band territories. It is therefore quite conceivable that groups dwelling most of the time, for example, at 4 to 6,000 feet, periodically exploited resources both at very much higher and very much lower altitudes. Plant ecology and the agricultural occupation of the Highlands. Studies of contemporary plant ecology (Robbins 1963a, b) have very important historical implications. Robbins notes that the extensive tall and short grasslands in the Highlands valleys and on the lower mountain slopes are man-made, the larger areas of short grasses having required a period of at least some hundreds of years for their creation by forest-clearing agriculturalists. He further demon- strates that the vegetation of the Eastern Highlands has been much more extensively modified by human action than the Western Highlands vegetation; that immigrant second growth plants all appear to have East-West distribu- tional gradients; and that the only area contiguous to the Highlands which shows a similar pattern of extensive and presumably ancient forest clearance by men, is the Markham Valley. Robbins infers from this that the main migra- tion of agricultural peoples into the Highlands occurred through the Markham Valley and moved progressively from East to West, though he does not exclude the possibility of some small population elements entering or approaching the fringes of the Highlands from other directions. Recently, Robbins has suggested that some forest areas in the Highlands, namely certain relatively pure stands of oak between 3,000 and 6,000 feet, may also be a desclimax flora created by agricultural activity. He makes the valu-</page><page sequence="14">52 New Guinea: The Central Highlands able suggestion that these possibly "artificial" stands, which are generally only a few acres in extent, merit close attention by archeologists in their search for artifacts and sites for excavation (R. G. Robbins, personal communication). If this hypothesis is correct, more elaborate sequences of biotic interference may have to be postulated-as one might also expect from consideration of the likely sequence of introduction of the major horticultural crops. However, there would still seem good grounds for accepting the forest-grassland gradient as indicative of more intensive cultivation, over a longer period in the immedi- ate past, in the East than in the West. It seems to us that Robbins' interpretation of grassland distributions strongly supports linguistic and cultural evidence for a somewhat different course of history in the East and West. This need not, however, imply a single point of entry for the main immigration into the Highlands, nor the ultimate derivation of all contemporary Western Highlands peoples from the East. It would be most surprising if some significant population and cultural elements did not enter the Highlands through the Markham Valley, but there is as yet no special reason to suppose that such crucial innovations as taro cultivation, pig husbandry, the modern stone axe, or even sweet potato cultivation, neces- sarily all came in by this route, or by any one single route. Conclusion. We may therefore postulate, before looking at the archeological evidence from the Highlands area itself: (1) Considerable antiquity for human occupation of New Guinea (10,000 years plus), and a period of, at the most conservative estimate, 8,000 years or so, within which most of the Highlands could have been settled by man. (2) Possible first occupation of the Highlands by hunters and gatherers; followed by a pre-sweet potato horticultural phase; followed by the develop- ment of the contemporary phase in which sweet potato cultivation is the base of the economy. (3) The presence in the Highlands of speech-communities ancestral to contemporary speech-communities at an early period, almost certainly before the introduction of the sweet potato and the economic and social revolutions which must have followed this introduction. (4) A somewhat different course of historical development in the Eastern and Western sub-regions of the Highlands. THE ARCHEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE Archeological evidence for the prehistory of the Highlands is at present very restricted. It consists of field evidence reported by government officials, missionaries and anthropologists, or obtained by one of the authors in a pre- liminary survey of sites in the area between Mt. Hagen Range in the Western Highlands District and Chuave in the Eastern Highlands District (S. Bulmer 1960); two excavations of rock shelters by S. Bulmer; and a number of collec- tions of unstratified artifacts. Highlands prehistory, however, ends in the 1930's, and for this reason the archeological evidence is considerably enriched by ethnographic records, in-</page><page sequence="15">The Prehistory 53 complete as these are. Contemporary artifacts include types which also occur in the archeological record, and collectively they provide some basis for the interpretation of the prehistoric assemblages. Material Culture (1930)1 We restrict ourselves to a listing of contemporary artifacts of durable ma- terials-stone, bone, shell and pottery-both because so far very few artifacts of other materials are present in the archeological record and because even a brief listing of all artifacts in the contemporary Highlands is beyond the scope of this paper. The classification is only provisional; records and descriptions are not complete enough for definitive classification. Stone Modern Highlands peoples live, as has been noted previously, by in- tensive horticulture, occupying tracts of mixed bush and/or grassland from which climax vegetation has been very largely removed by human activity. This economy depends on efficient tools for chopping, cutting and scraping, for bush-clearing and garden fencing, for building substantial dwelling houses and for the manufacture of tools and weapons of wood and bone. By far the most conspicuous and important stone tools of the modern Highlands were the axes. Axes and adzes Stone axe blades were most commonly hafted, not with cutting edge paral- lel with the haft handle, but at about 100 in the Western Highlands, and at a greater angle, up to about 450, in parts of the Eastern and Southern Highlands Districts. Some blades were hafted in swivel sockets at Kutubu and Tari in the Southern Highlands, with the angle of set varied for different purposes. There are reports from a number of localities of stone blades hafted as adzes (at 900 to the haft handle), but this type of hafting does not appear to have been com- mon; there is as yet no evidence that the blades so hafted were different in bevelling or other features from many of those hafted as axes. In the following discussion we will refer both to modern blades and to all prehistoric examples similar to those in use in modern times, as "axes" or "axe-adzes," leaving the issue open for future research since evidence of hafting has not appeared yet in excavation. Axe blades used throughout the Western Highlands were manufactured at a small number of quarry or stream sites-eight have been reported-in the Wahgi, Chimbu and Jimi Valleys (S. Bulmer 1964; J. M. A. Chappell, personal communication). The great majority is made of fine-grained greywackes and argillites which have been subjected to low grade contact metamorphism, though some from the Chuave region are of poorly foliated amphibolites. One stream site on the Upper Asaro River, in the Eastern Highlands has been re- ported (Salisbury 1962a:85) and there must have been other axe manufactur- ing sites in the Eastern Highlands which have not yet been recorded. Western Highlands blades are quadrangular or planilateral (rounded with flat sides) in cross-section, ungripped, symmetrical or nearly symmetrical in bevelling, and</page><page sequence="16">54 New Guinea: The Central Highlands were made by flaking, battering, or sawing, followed by overall grinding and polishing. Eastern Highlands blades (cf. Adam 1953) include some quadrangu- lar or planilateral specimens, possibly imports from the Western Highlands; the majority are lenticular or oval-lenticular in cross-section, while some are intermediate, with an essentially lenticular cross-section with narrow flat sides. As with the Western Highlands blades, most finished blades are ground and polished, symmetrically bevelled, and all are ungripped. (See Fig. 4) The axe-adze was the all-purpose tool in modern times. Unhafted axe-adze blades were also used occasionally as knives, chisels or scrapers. Highlanders appear to have made few stone implements of other types. Those known to us are listed below. It should be noted that most of these tools are known from restricted localities only, except for a fair proportion from the fringe areas on the northern or southern limits of the Highlands. Other ground or polished tools (1) Knives or chisels, rhomboidal or trapezoidal in shape, polished and of similar material to the axe-adze blades, used unhafted in woodcarving. (Schrader Mountains and probably Western Highlands generally). (2) Barkcloth beaters, grooved, made of similar stone to axe-adze blades. (Eastern Highlands and lower Wahgi Valley. In Western Highlands only beaters of wood or bone are reported: in Eastern Highlands both stone and wood beaters are known.) Pecked Stone (1) Sago picks or hammers, mounted in adze hafts: identical artifacts, unhafted, are used as pestles. (Kutubu). J. N. Jennings (personal communication) collected one Kutubu sago pick made of obsidian. (2) Knobbed perforated club heads, hafted on long wooden shafts (re- corded at Kutubu, but not manufactured there); Jennings (personal communication) was informed that these weapons came from Bosavi. (3) Mortars. J. M. A. Chappell (personal communication 1964) was told by an elderly informant at Kerowagi (Wahgi Valley) that he had in his lifetime made mortars for processing vegetable arrow poison. Elaborately flaked tools (1) Flat blades with flared sides and wide flaked cutting edges, used for cutting cane grass: these look as though they might be roughouts for ground-edged axe-adze blades, but are made of regional meta-grey- wackes not used for polished stone tools (Chuave). Possible pebble tools (1) "A pebble or piece of flinty stone snapped off sharp" (Williams 1940: 28), hafted like adzes, used as a sago-scraper (Kutubu). Small flake tools, without secondary retouch (1) Scrapers, knives and awls, probably throughout the Highlands. Re- ports that flakes were sometimes hafted at Kutubu and lower Wahgi.</page><page sequence="17">The Prehistory 55 (2) Hafted drill points (Wahgi Valley, Kutubu). (3) Tattooing blades (Schrader Mountains, Lower Wahgi Valley and East- ern Highlands, Chuave). (4) Arrow points, for ceremonial incision (Upper Asaro Valley). Unworked stones (1) Hammer stones, for roughing out axe-adze blades (Wahgi and Jimi Valleys and presumably Eastern Highlands also). (2) Pounders for cracking nuts (Baiyer Valley, and probably general). (3) Grindstones and files or rubbers, for polishing and sharpening axe-adze blades (general). (4) Hoe blades: lenticular-sectioned river pebbles with natural blunt point, hafted as adzes (Schrader Mountains: lenticular sectioned wooden hoe blades, also hafted like adzes, are recorded in Chimbu area. Nilles 1942/5) (5) Digging stick points, cigar-shaped (Schrader Mountains). Bone The following artifacts have been recorded in the Western Highlands (including the lower Wahgi Valley). They were probably also present in the Eastern Highlands, but except for the Gende, records of bone artifacts from this area are inadequate. It is noticeable that these are all artifacts which make maximum use of the size and natural shape of bones utilized, with a minimum of additional shaping. Tools (1) Pig tusk scrapers. (2) Gravers of rodent jaws (esp. Mallormys) or hafted dog or pig teeth. (3) Needles, mainly of flying fox long bone, but also of splinters of casso- wary or mammal bone. (4) Awls of dog rib, or cassowary long bone. (5) Barkcloth beaters of pig femur (Baiyer Valley). Ornaments (1) Hair pins of bird long bone or splinters of cassowary or mammal bone. (Palmwood pins are also used). (2) Pendants of perforated cassowary and mammal bones, and mammal jaws. (3) Neck ornaments of dog and pig teeth, pig tusks, bird claws and beaks (especially hornbill). Other (1) Daggers of cassowary long bone (Northern and Southern fringe areas). (2) Round-ended jabbers or spatulae of cassowary long bone. (3) Spoons of pig scapulae.</page><page sequence="18">56 New Guinea: The Central Highlands (4) Small spatulate taro-scrapers of pig- and possibly tree-kangaroo-bone (Schrader Mountains). (5) Spear points of sliced-off human long bone, hornbill beak and casso- wary claw. (6) Arrow points of sliced-off human long bone. (7) Rattles (for jews harps) of mammal jaws (perforated). Shell Shell, imported from coast and lowlands, was used throughout the High- lands for personal ornaments and as valuables in exchange transactions. At least seven types of marine shell are reported as present in some quantity at the time of European contact: Pinctada (mother-of-pearl), Melo (bailer), Turbo (green-snail), Nassa and Nassarius (dog-whelk or tambu), Conus, and Cypraea (cowries), while there are more doubtful records of Nautilus, Trochus and Ovulum ovi. The larger shells were used either whole or in pieces as pendants, usually with perforations for suspensions, while Nassa, Nassarius and Cypraea were sewn onto bark-cloth, the former used in headbands and other small per- sonal adornments, the latter made up into fathom-long strips as personal adorn- ments and exchange valuables. Four distinctive ornaments were made from marine shell: the mother-of-pearl crescent (either perforated at either end or mounted on a resin plaque), the nose-strip of pearlshell, the Conus nose-disc, and the Conus ring. We are aware of only two records of shell implements. Freshwater mussel (Unionidae) shells from lowland rivers were used as banana scrapers in the Schrader Mountains. The Chimbu of the lower Wahgi Valley are reported to have used pieces of marine shell, presumably Turbo or Nautilus, as spoons (Nilles 1943/4: 7). Small perforated cassowary egg shell discs or chips are recorded as orna- ments at Kutubu and among the Siane of the Eastern Highlands, either sewn onto bark or threaded like beads (Williams 1940:20, Salisbury 1962a:90). Ceramics Pottery. The only records of pottery manufacture in the Highlands are from two localities fifteen miles apart on the Northern fringe of the Eastern Highlands, among Agarabi and Kamano-speaking communities (V. Watson 1955). Agarabi pottery is made by coil technique, two kinds of vessels being produced, round and bell-shaped, both with everted rims. These are decorated with incisions on the lip and bands of incisions or punctuates on the lower part of the neck. Fragments measured were about ' inch thick. Kamano pottery is of similar shape, but the examples described are rather thinner, and have a different style of decoration consisting of parallel lines of punctuates only. Bell-shaped pots were also imported by the Gende of the Bismarck Moun- tains from the Ramu Valley (Aufenanger and Hiltker 1940:9, 55). The occa- sional use of pots obtained by trade and exchange has been reported in other</page><page sequence="19">The Prehistory 57 parts of the Eastern Highlands (V. Watson 1955) and from Chimbu (Nilles 1943/4:6). Clay flutes. Small unfired clay flutes or ocarinas of curious shape and orna- mentation (lower Wahgi and Chimbu Valleys). The occurrence of many of these artifacts in our excavations and in surface collections and non-stratigraphic excavations will be discussed below. Among implements recognizable from their form alone, only the following are absent from our excavations: barkcloth beaters; sago-picks/pestles; mortars; club- heads; pig-bone spoons; pig- or tree kangaroo-bone spatulate scrapers. How- ever, some stone implements, such as pounders and the simpler flake tools, and the majority of simple bone implements are not readily identifiable except in contexts of use. There is no evidence in the excavations of most of the kinds of marine shell known in recent times, including bailer, green-snail, dog-whelk, conus and mature mother-of-pearl. Nor have worked or perforated cassowary shell frag- ments been identified, and there is no evidence for clay flutes. FIELD EVIDENCE Most of the extensive unoccupied grassland areas of the Western High- lands are, as we have seen, evidence for the past utilization of these tracts for agriculture. There are no grounds for supposing that all present Western Highlands grasslands were created or occupied simultaneously at some period of the past, or that they are evidence of a "vanished civilization," or of par- ticularly dense former human settlement in the valley bottoms where most of then occur. Some parts of these areas have, in fact, been used within living memory, while others are being re-occupied at the present day (Brookfield, this issue). Garden ditches inspected by S. Bulmer in several parts of the Wahgi and Baiyer grasslands were said by local informants to have been made within living memory. Possible reasons for abandoning grassland areas include inde- fensibility in warfare, poor or highly variable soils, and the introduction of malaria (cf. S. Bulmer 1960, Brookfield 1962). No open sites of early domestic habitation have as yet been located in the Highlands, although a few of recent date have been investigated. No evidence of stone construction, or of earth works on any but a minor scale, has come to light. One monolith has been recorded in the Wahgi Valley (Murphy 1938:38). There is no indication at present that past habitation in the Western Highlands has involved consolidated settlement. No field evidence, other than shelter and cave sites, has so far been reported from the Eastern Highlands. The apparent lack of field evidence may be in part attributed to the exten- sive and continuing erosion that has taken place as a result of garden activities. It is probable that much evidence of the past on the lower slopes has been buried as the result of gardening at higher altitudes. H. C. Brookfield (personal communication) has suggested that volcanic ash falls, which are described in</page><page sequence="20">58 New Guinea: The Central Highlands folk histories from several parts of the Highlands, may also have contributed to the concealment of archeological evidence.8 Deep excavations such as in the building of airstrips in the Wahgi and Jimi Valleys have in several instances uncovered artifacts, reputedly at depths of up to 15 feet. Likewise, continued habitation and cultivation of the upper mountain slopes results in the destruc- tion of surface evidence. There can be no doubt that at least some of the evi- dence of ancient habitation is still present, but the discovery of sites may have to depend on further natural erosion or human activity uncovering them. Rock shelters and caves, which are numerous in the mountainsides in all areas investigated by the authors in the Western Highlands, were found com- monly to contain some signs of human activity, such as small deposits of ash and smoke stains on overhanging rocks. In fact, these sites are frequently used by modern Highlanders wherever they occur; in the Mt. Hagen and Nebilyer Valley regions all those investigated were at high altitudes, well above the level of cultivation, and were used for camping on hunting expeditions and journeys -and in one case in the Nebilyer, for secondary burial. In the Baiyer, Chimbu and Chuave areas many shelters and caves were investigated in or near present cultivation areas. Most of these were used for day-time shelter and cooking; a few contained secondary burials; according to all local informants, many had been places of refuge in times of war. The use of rock clefts and shelters for secondary burial has also been reported from Kutubu (Williams 1940:127). Only three of the eight sites where trial excavations were made were found to contain artifacts. However, only a small proportion of caves and shelters of archeological potential has been investigated, even in the areas where the authors spent long periods. Cliff faces, rock shelters or caves bearing charcoal or pigment drawings or paintings have been reported from the Kainantu region of the Eastern High- lands (J. Holmes, personal communication), the Jimi Valley (Aufenanger 1958), the upper Lai Valley (M. J. Meggitt, personal communication), Kutubu (Williams 1940:127), and have been recorded at four sites in the Mt. Hagen area, two at Chimbu and two at Chuave (cf. S. Bulmer 1960). Many of the figures were obviously fresh or recent, while others are said by local people to be of ancient date. Four sites contain figures which may be of some antiquity. Aufenanger (1958) notes that the three-foot-high human figure with out-stretched limbs, blocked in entirely in brown ochre and flanked by a lizard and a ribbon of diamond-shaped figures, was said by local people in the upper Jimi Valley not to be of recent execution. S. Bulmer found two sites near Mt. Hagen and one near Chuave (which was also the site of the Kiowa excavation described be- low) which contained large numbers of drawings, some overlain by other, al- most certainly recent, ones. The drawings at these sites are almost entirely monochrome, either black (charcoal) or red (ochre). They appear to consist of doodling, mainly semi-naturalistic outline zoomorphic or anthropomorphic figures, and symmetrical and asymmetrical geometric designs. Among items here identified as recent are representations of pearlshell crescents, axes and head-dresses, and writing.</page><page sequence="21">The Prehistory 59 Designs at these and other sites which are of recent or quite uncertain date include: stick-figure human representations, diamonds, chevrons and other geometric designs, at ossuary shelters near Kutubu (Williams 1940); stick figure human representations in red ochre in the upper Lai Valley, one with flexed arms and elaborately drawn face and head, clearly depicting the large round Enga wig (Meggitt, personal communication); a naturalistic outline drawing of a cassowary, near Mt. Hagen; black and white renderings of mod- ern-style head-dresses, and miscellaneous geometric figures, near Mt. Hagen; similar figures in red and white at one of the Chimbu sites; and, at the other Chimbu and both Chuave sites, diamonds, chevrons, triangles and circles in red pigment, which were said by local informants to be "scoreboard" marks for the killing of important men in warfare. Excavations The excavation in 1959-60 of two rock shelter sites by S. Bulmer revealed the presence and stratigraphical relationship of artifacts not previously known for the Highlands. The two sites are about 80 miles apart, one at Yuku (4,100 feet) near a tributary of the Lai River in the Western Highlands, and the other at Kiowa (5,100 feet) near Chuave Government Station in the Eastern High- lands District on the borderline of present-day Eastern and Western High- lands cultures. A preliminary description of the excavations and the large stone implements from the two sites is presented elsewhere (S. Bulmer 1964). Here we will be concerned mainly with the cultural sequences apparent from the excavations and their relationship to the previous discussion.9 The Kiowa site was an irregular rock-ledge approximately 18 feet wide and 20 feet long, sheltered by a high cliff. Initially a rectangle 8 feet by 16 feet was excavated, its width roughly parallel to the cliff-face. Later the rear portion of the excavation was extended as a trench six feet wide beneath the rock at the back and side of the shelter. Domestic habitation over a long period was indi- cated by the remains of cooking and of stone and bone tool manufacture im- bedded in fifteen feet of well stratified ash and soil.The earliest assemblage of stone implements, which persisted until habitation on the site ceased (Levels 2-12), included pebble tools (waterworn pebbles or large flakes from pebbles, with a unifacial working edge at one end, along one side, or on two sides con- verging in a wide point) and flake implements of considerable variety. In the middle levels of the sequence (Levels 3-5) two other types of arti- facts were added to the early assemblage: polished lenticular-sectioned axe- adze blades, and waisted blades (flaked blades with grip reduction on the sides). In the most recent stage of habitation at Kiowa (Level 2), planilateral polished axe-adze blades are present, as well as examples of all the earlier arti- facts. Following this, the site appears to have been uninhabited for some pe- riod, although a few fire-blackened stones and disturbed ashes in Level 1 testify to occasional visits to the site by humans. Bone artifacts are present throughout the habitation of the site, together with large amounts of bone d6bris from domestic cooking and many fragments of cut bone resulting from bone tool manufacture. The bone artifacts are all</page><page sequence="22">60 New Guinea: The Central Highlands within the range of-although not, in all cases, identical to-modern High- lands bone implements, with the single exception of one carefully shaped and polished double-ended point in Level 4. The point is 2.9 inches long and rec- tangular in cross-section, and is not unlike the fusiform Australian bone points sometimes termed muduk (Mulvaney 1961:83-4). It is apparent, from wear, that some of the bone implements were used for scraping. Three ornaments of marine shell were excavated at Kiowa. From Level 2 came a broken cockle shell (Arca granosa) with abraded edges and an indenta- tion at the hinge edge similar to that of the modern Conus nose disc, and a curved portion of Trochus niloticus similar in shape to some septum ornaments 0 1 2 3 ?ii inches II (a) (b) (e) (f) (c) (d) FIG. 1.

From Level 7 came a broken piece of juvenile pearl oyster (Pinctada) with a ground and polished back. Freshwater mussel shell was also excavated, three specimens from Level 2 and one from 5. All were abraded around the edges, indicating use as scrapers, and one from Level 2 was also polished on the back, possibly for use as an orna- ment. Pottery was excavated from Level 2, contemporary with the examples of</page><page sequence="24">62 New Guinea: The Central Highlands planilateral axe-adze blades-three undecorated fragments, all between 0.23 and 0.30 inches thick. The largest, which alone shows evidence of manufacture by coil technique, is part of a slightly everted rim which was probably about five inches in diameter. The small quantity present suggests that the pottery was imported. Pottery is known to have been traded into neighboring areas at the time of European contact (see above). The wide range of faunal remains found at all levels of this site awaits de- tailed identification and analysis. They include large quantities of Cassowary (Casuarius sp.), Tree Kangaroo (Dendrolagus sp.), Cuscus (Phalanger spp.), Possum (Pseudocheirus spp.) and Flying Fox (possibly Dobsonia sp.). In Level 9 a mandible of the Thylacine or "Tasmanian Wolf" (Thylacinus sp.), hitherto unreported in New Guinea, was discovered (Van Deusen 1963). This record is of some archeological importance, since it may be argued that an area provid- ing sufficient terrestrial game to support a carnivore the size of Thylacine could also support a human hunting population. Preliminary inspection has not as yet indicated the presence of pig or dog anywhere in this site. The artifact sequence at Kiowa suggests continuity of populations: the artifacts of the earliest technology persist throughout the entire habitation sequence, with the addition of new artifacts at two different periods. This could have been brought about by the diffusion of new types of artifacts to the peoples already present in the area, or by the replacement of the resident groups by other closely related groups who had acquired the new artifacts. However, the evidence at Kiowa is against the supplanting of the original inhabitants by peoples with a completely different technology. Local tradition concurs with this interpretation; the modern residents believe that their ances- tors have always lived in the immediate area. At the Yuku site, in contrast, the artifact sequence is discontinuous. This shelter had approximately 200 square feet of ground protected by a rock over- hang, 132 square feet of which was excavated. It contained 9-12 feet of de- posit, which was excavated in seven levels. The earliest assemblage (Levels 4-7) includes pebble tools, flake implements, large thick-backed flake scrapers and waisted flaked blades. In Level 3, a fragment of a polished lenticular axe- adze blade is present, while waisted blades similar in shape and material to those at earlier levels have ground edges and general surface grinding. Follow- ing this (in Levels 1 and 2) only small flake tools and a fragment of a polished planilateral axe-adze blade are present. Bone implements similar to those excavated at Kiowa are present through- out the habitation of the site, but no examples of fusiform bone points were found. A perforated human tooth, probably an ornament, was found in Level 3.

None of these creatures is at present taken regularly within half a day's walk of the site because of destruction of forest in this locality by agricultural clearing. Pig is evident in Levels 1 to 3 only. No evidence of dog has yet been recognized. The nature of deposit in Levels 2 and 3 at Yuku suggests that the discon- tinuity in the stone artifact assemblage did not involve any great period of time; there was no sterile deposit or weathered surface to indicate the abandon- ment of the site. However, the site is so small that subsequent occupation would have completely destroyed a weathered surface. It is of interest that three disturbed burials were present in and on Level 3. The present inhabitants of the area immediately around the site insisted that these were not their an- cestors, that is, were not members of their own clan, which had only occupied the territory for two generations; nor, to their knowledge were they members of the clan previously occupying the ground, to which some of them were con- nected through maternal links. The ancestors of both these groups and of most other Kyaka clans are said to have entered the general region six or seven gen- erations ago, having crossed the crest of Mt. Hagen on their way in. Considerable caution must be exercised in drawing conclusions from these first two excavations in the Highlands. For example, the appearance of the polished lenticular axe-adze in Level 5 at Kiowa is confirmed by one broken blade and one polished stone flake, and in Level 3 at Yuku by one polished fragment. Likewise, although there are five whole or broken lenticular blades and two fragments not showing cross-section in Level 2 at Kiowa, there are only two fragments of planilateral blades in the same Level, and at Yuku only one small fragment of a planilateral blade in Level 2. These specimens are not questionable, and the absence of other examples from lower Levels could pos- sibly be accidental, since the size of the sites and the numbers of examples are so small. It is, however, plausible that the lenticular axe-adze was not in use in the most recent two levels at Yuku, as such blades were not used within living memory in the area, although they occur in surface collections. The interpretation of the waisted flaked blade cannot, on present evidence, be a simple one. At Kiowa they were contemporary with the earliest example of a polished axe-adze blade and continued until recent times, while at Yuku they appeared well before the polished axe-adze, and there is no evidence that they were made or used in the most recent period. In the light of the Kiowa evidence, this type of artifact could be interpreted as a hoe, particularly since wooden hoes have been reported from nearby Chimbu, and residents of Chuave reported that similar blades had been used for cutting cane grass. At Yuku, on the other hand, they are present for a considerable period before forest-clearing implements are evident, but were later replaced by ground implements of similar shape. Thus waisted flaked blades may have been part of the tool kit of pre- agricultural peoples in the Highlands, although later they may also have been</page><page sequence="28">66 New Guinea: The Central Highlands used for gardening in some areas."1 Their ground derivatives can plausibly be regarded as wood-working or -chopping tools. In any case, it appears from the pronounced gripping on their sides, particularly on the Yuku specimens, that they were hafted, and not hand implements. From the foregoing evidence it is possible to posit tentative technological phases for two restricted localities. These, of course, may or may not be rele- vant to other areas of the Highlands, although the overlap of the sites is no- table. Moreover, they may not represent the complete picture even for their immediate area, and only future excavations will provide the evidence neces- easy to validate these first tentative conclusions. Kiowa Phase A. (Levels 6-12). A long period, with habitation apparently at first sporadic, but later continuous, by peoples with pre-neolithic stone imple- ments. These were probably hunters and gatherers, although they may have depended partially on cultivated plants in small clearings, and were probably representatives of peoples widely, but not densely, settled throughout the Highlands. Trade from the coast is suggested in at least the latter part of the sequence by the presence of marine shell. Kiowa Phase B. (Levels 3-5). Phase B follows Phase A without stratigraphic discontinuity, and is also characterized by apparently continuous occupation. Level 5 contains the earliest examples of lenticular polished axe-adze blades and a waisted blade. If this is indeed the period of the introduction of the edge- ground axe-adze-the implement that would have made large-scale forest- clearing possible-this is most likely the period of a changeover from a pre- dominantly hunting and gathering economy to greater dependence upon agri- culture. The Phase A assemblage of artifacts persisted through this phase, suggesting that the earlier economy was not entirely displaced. Trade with nearby Highlands groups is indicated by the presence of the polished axe-adze, which most likely came from quarry or stream sources at some distance from the site. Kiowa Phase C. (Level 2).-As with Phases A and B, there is no strati- graphic discontinuity between Phases B and C. The appearance of the plani- lateral axe-adze and of pottery suggests influence, possibly indirect, from coastal or lowland river areas, perhaps accompanied by other important traits such as new crops. On present evidence, this could possibly be associated with the emergence of the modern Western Highlands culture groups and their ex- pansion, since the only known sources of planilateral axe-adze blades are the Jimi and Wahgi valleys. However, the types of artifacts from the first two phases are present here also, indicating continuity of technology and popula- tions. Yuku Phase A. (Levels 4-7).-The earliest phase of habitation at Yuku can also be interpreted as one in which hunting and gathering predominated. The presence of one type of artifact, the waisted blade, which does not appear until Phase B at Kiowa, along with polished stone tools, may indicate that agricul- ture was also significant. In either case, it is probable that there was an earlier phase in the Yuku area, equivalent to IKiowa Phase A, which is not represented</page><page sequence="29">The Prehistory 67 at the Yuku site. It is also probable that Kiowa Phase A is earlier in time than Yuku Phase A. Yuku Phase B. (Level 3).-This phase is marked by the first appearance of a lenticular-sectioned polished axe-adze, and by the application of grinding to the waisted blades, which were used unground in Yuku Phase A. Since the Phase A assemblage of pebble tools and flake implements persists into Phase B, it is likely that the presence of the two new elements of stone technology repre- sent introductions to a resident population. Possessing polished axe-adzes and, by inference, agriculture, the Phase B people may have begun to clear the forest on some scale. The pig is clearly evident. Yuku Phase C. (Levels 1-2).-In this phase much of the earlier assemblage is absent, but a planilateral polished axe-adze, accompanied by flake and bone implements, is present. It is possible that this phase represents the intrusion into the area of the Kyaka Enga people who live there today, since some of the evidence from Levels 1 and 2, such as earth-oven pits, which were not present up to Phase C, is consistent with the ethnographically known Kyaka. The stratigraphic evidence points to only a short period of time being involved in the transition from Phases B to C. It is possible that Phase C is approximately equivalent in time on the two sites, since the appearance of the planilateral axe-adze in both cases could rep- resent intensified trade-or at least a new style in stone manufacture-from the Jimi and Wahgi quarry areas, possibly as a consequence of expanding agricultural population within the Highlands region, of which indeed the Kyaka Enga appear to be a part. Other stone artifacts.-From the earliest years of European exploration of the Highlands, other types of stone artifacts have been reported which are clearly "prehistoric" in that they have not been made by contemporary Highlands peoples, but which are also, unfortunately, still unrepresented in archeological excavations. All these objects are manufactured by pecking and grinding tech- niques. Although their status must remain highly problematical, they are of importance for two reasons. First, their general distribution both within and outside the Highlands would seem to imply that, at some period in the past, the Highlands have been culturally more closely linked to other parts of north- eastern New Guinea than they are today. Second, they may be taken as evi- dence of a period when general economic and social conditions in the Highlands were significantly different from those obtaining in recent times. From published lists and descriptions, notably by Bramell (1939), Williams (1940), H*iltker (1940/41, 1951), McCarthy (1949), Riesenfeld (1950), Wirz (1951), Berndt (1954), Aufenanger (1960) and R. &amp; S. Bulmer (1962), and from unpublished collections which we have examined," we have the following records: (1) Mortars. 120 examples. Reported as occurring in nearly all parts of the Highlands for which we have ethnographic records, though the greatest num- bers are from the Wahgi Valley (54), Baiyer Valley (36), Jimi Valley (9) and</page><page sequence="30">68 New Guinea: The Central Highlands Ramu-Markham headwaters on the north-eastern fringe of the Eastern High- lands (13). Materials are volcanic stones (mainly tuffs and andesites) and cal- careous sandstones. They range in size from examples with cups 28 cm. in diameter (internal measurement) and weights of up to 50 lb., to examples with cups 10 cm. in diameter weighing less than 40 oz. Most are relatively shallow, with the depth of the cup half or less of its diameter. Some are natural stones with an artificial indentation, others plain unornamented bowls. 23 examples have pronounced pedestal bases. At least 52 examples, including some with pedestal base, are ornamented with single rows of raised bosses round the sides or rim. Seven examples are decorated on sides or base with anthropomorphic or zoomorphic features; two of these have pronounced lugs in the shape of a bird's head, wings and tail, and one is reported as shaped like a human female. One complete mortar and three broken fragments have single horizontal stirrup handles. (2) Pestles. 29 examples, of which 12 come from the Wahgi Valley, eight from the Baiyer Valley, and five from the eastern part of the Eastern High- lands. Most are bulbular or mushroom-shaped, with short, often broken, han- dles. One complete example from the Baiyer Valley is a tapering cylinder, 48 cm. long and 4.3 cm. in maximum diameter, and some other fragments from the Wahgi and Baiyer Valleys may be interpreted as parts of similar artifacts. Materials reported are all volcanic stones. (3) Figurines. (a) 13 small bird figurines, nearly all the complete pieces mounted on short stems, suggesting that they were originally pestle handles (three examples of bird-handled stone pestles are known from other parts of Eastern New Guinea-c.f. Hiltker 1951), eight from the Wahgi Valley, five from the Baiyer Valley. (b) two small human head figurines, both on stems which suggest that these too could have been pestle handles. Both from Baiyer Valley. (c) two full-length anthropomorphic figures, 23 and 25 cm. in length. Both from Baiyer Valley. These objects are in all reported cases made of hard volcanic stones. The human heads and other anthropomorphic figures bear clear stylistic resem- blances to some recent Sepik Valley wood carvings and masks. (4) Perforated Clubheads. 186 examples. The greatest concentrations are again in the Wahgi Valley (86), and Baiyer Valley (75). A wide range of designs is present, most of which have been reported in the collections of artifacts in contemporary use in southern Papua surveyed by Haddon (1900). Plain discs, flanged discs, "pineapples," "sunflowers," and discs or rings with single or double rows of knobs round the rim, are all numerous. There are also examples of double-ended picks, and of objects which could equally be interpreted as perforated adze-blades. There are at least eight examples of narrow perforated adzes or "battle-adzes," with flared sides, which strongly suggest a bronze prototype. Nearly all club heads are made of hard volcanic stones. Collections from the Wahgi and Baiyer Valleys include a number of unfinished specimens.</page><page sequence="31">The Prehistory 69 (5) Small perforated stones. Upwards of 50 examples, nearly all from the Wahgi and Baiyer Valleys, though there are also records from the Kainantu region. Most of these are too small to be considered as clubheads, though we include in this category some which could conceivably have had this function. Most are small doughnut-like rings, though some are discs or balls, while a few have knobbed ornamentation. They are made of a wider range of materials than the clubheads, some being of hard volcanic rocks, while others are of very soft stone. Ethnographic evidence suggests that some of these were made within living memory. Mortars, pestles and clubheads have been found on ground surfaces and in stream beds, and have been obtained from the ground in gold-dredgings, agri- cultural operations, and European construction works. Many have been found as antiquities in native possession. Some present-day Highlands peoples treat these objects as things of no account, but most generally they are kept as magi- cal charms or cult objects. It is known that many examples remain in native possession, especially in parts of the Western Highlands where they figure prominently in fertility and prosperity cults. The only "practical" uses re- corded for any of these objects are at Lake Kutubu where prehistoric mortars were used in the preparation of cult medicines, and clubheads, also not locally manufactured within living memory, were found hafted up as weapons (Wil- liams 1940: 27, 30), and in the Wahgi Valley where J. M. A. Chappell (personal communication) was told that mortars were used in the preparation of arrow poison from fire-cooked leaves. There are grounds for assuming that all these categories of objects were manufactured within the Highlands, and that they form a single technological complex; that is, that at some period the same people were making and using all the main categories, with the possible exception of the small stone rings. The large numbers present in the Highlands, the fact that the stone materi- als used are all known to be present in the Highlands-particularly in the Western Highlands areas where the artifacts have been found in greatest con- centration-and the fact that unfinished examples have been recorded, all point to the local manufacture of these objects, if not in all parts of the High- lands, at least in some restricted area or areas whence they were distributed by trade or exchange. The fact that most of the figurines can plausibly be interpreted as pestle handles suggests that the figurines, pestles and mortars may be considered as associated artifacts. The following facts suggest that it is legitimate to con- sider the clubheads as part of the same complex as the other artifacts: 1) the use of the same techniques in the manufacture of clubheads and of the other arti- facts; 2) the parallels between the knobbing on many of the clubheads and the ornamental bosses on the mortars (c.f. Hiltker 1940/41: Plate I); 3) the simi- lar pattern of distribution of clubheads and mortars within the Highlands- both being particularly numerous in the Wahgi and Baiyer Valleys, and 4) the fact that outside the Highlands the distribution of pestles and mortars in East New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago all lies within the wider area of</page><page sequence="32">70 New Guinea: The Central Highlands distribution of stone clubheads. This does not mean that the manufacture and practical use of all kinds of clubheads in the Highlands necessarily coincided completely in time with the manufacture and use of all kinds of pestles and mortars. It is possible, for example, that simple clubheads and simple undec- orated mortars preceded the more elaborate versions. It is certainly possible that clubheads were made and used after the manufacture of pestles and mor- tars ceased. The extensive wear on some mortars and pestles, and the presence of crude undecorated mortars as well as finely made ones, would seem to indicate that these untensils had practical functions. At the same time, the range in size and shape suggests that these functions were diverse, including possibly the prepa- ration of pigments, medicines, poisons, and various kinds of foodstuffs. How- ever, the size and relatively shallow proportions of the majority of mortars would seem to indicate that these were best suited for grinding nut kernels and seeds. Several uncultivated plants in the Highlands have seeds which could be processed in this way, including nuts of the oak-like Castanopsis acuminatis- sima and of at least three species of Elaeocarpus trees, which are used today as very minor sources of food, and Job's Tears (Coix lachryma-jobi)-some varie- ties of which are known to have been a foodstuff in parts of south-east Asia (Brown 1951:139-41, Burkill 1935: I, 629-30) and which have been reported, without documentation, as a food in New Guinea (Barrau 1958:49), although their widespread present use is for ornamentation. In parts of lowland New Guinea and other Oceanic islands, either deep wooden mortars and long- handled pestles, or large, relatively flat-surfaced stone pounders used on shallow wooden vessels or flat blocks of wood or stone, are used for pulping vegetable foods, especially cooked taro roots. Few of the Highlands mortars appear to be large enough for this purpose, but it is possible that the long-handled pestles were used with deep wooden vessels. At the same time, the ornamentation on many mortars and pestles (or putative pestle-handles) suggests that these possibly had cult or ceremonial significance. From what is known of trade and ceremonial exchange in Mela- nesia in recent times, it seems highly probable that at the period when these objects were being manufactured, some of them were exchange valuables as well as having practical uses. Two features of the apparent distribution of this complex within the High- lands are of interest. First, the overwhelming preponderance of records is from the Mt. Hagen - Baiyer Valley - Wahgi Valley region of the Western High- lands, although the Ramu headwaters area at the eastern end of the Eastern Highlands is also fairly well represented. Although it is possible to argue that present records may not, for a number of reasons, reflect the real distribution of artifacts, we believe that they do. It is very possible, for example, that Euro- peans have searched more diligently in some areas than others; however, Berndt (1954), who did intensive fieldwork in the Eastern Highlands and made only a survey visit to the West, notes how much more common these kinds of prehistoric stones appeared to be in the Mt. Hagen-Wahgi Valley area than in</page><page sequence="33">The Prehistory 71 the East, while Wirz (1952a:51), who worked both in the Lai Valley and in the Mt. Hagen-Wahgi Valley region, comments on the paucity of this material in the former area as compared with the latter. It is also undoubtedly the case that different contemporary Highlands peoples set different values on prehis- toric stones, and it may be that records are low from groups which show little interest of any kind in them or which value them highly and do not wish to let outsiders see them. However, records are numerous from the territory of the Mt. Hagen peoples, who still use these stones extensively in their cults, and from the neighboring Kuma, who show little interest in them. Alternatively, as Dr. J. B. Watson has suggested to us, varying edaphic factors in different parts of the Highlands may significantly affect the ease with which stones are recov- ered. On this point we have little positive information, but would note that records are numerous in the Western Highlands both from hill-slope areas currently cultivated by native peoples (as in the Baiyer Valley) and from the flatter land in the Wahgi Valley where Europeans have laid out airstrips and cleared plantations. We suggest then that existing records do reasonably reflect the real con- centration of the complex in parts of the Western Highlands, and that two possible explanations may be given for this. The first is that the volcanic rocks from which most of the artifacts were made may have a restricted distribution; certainly these appear to be plentiful in the Mt. Hagen region. The second is that this complex reflects a cultural tradition which either was not adopted in all parts of the Highlands, or was maintained for a longer period, or by a larger number of people, in some parts than others. Even if regional specialization in manufacture only is inferred, based ultimately on irregular local distribution of raw materials, this would still imply some degree of differentiation between Eastern and Western Highlands. The second distributional feature which is of possible significance is that the great majority of finds come from altitudes between approximately 4,000 and 5,500 feet. Very few records of objects in native possession come from present- day areas of high population density above 6,000 feet, and only four mortars and one pestle are known to have been recovered from the ground above this altitude (one mortar at 6,100 feet on the north slopes of Mt. Hagen; a mortar and pestle from the Timin River, a tributary of the Tarua in the Sau Valley region at about 6,500 feet, and two mortars from the Aunjang Valley, Schrader Mountains, at 7,000 feet). This suggests that the populations making and using these artifacts were generally dwelling at rather lower altitudes than present- day populations do. Many Highlands mortars, pestles, figurines and clubheads show detailed similarities with examples from mainland New Guinea to the north and east of the Highlands, and from New Britain. These suggest, first, the introduction of this complex to the Highlands from the north or north-east; and second, either the very rapid diffusion of this complex to the Highlands from the North coast or the actual incursion of new population elements bringing this complex with them, as posited by Riesenfeld (1950) and other authors.</page><page sequence="34">72 New Guinea: The Central Highlands Outside the Highlands, stone pestles and mortars are known only from the mainland of New Guinea east of the middle Sepik and upper Kikori Rivers, though they are also present in the Bismarck Archipelago and other islands to the east. Stone clubheads have a wider distribution in New Guinea-as pre- historic objects in Northern Coastal areas as far West as the Toricelli Range, and as weapons in contemporary use in many parts of Southern New Guinea, in both Australian and Indonesian territory. The general distribution of the complex in East New Guinea and island Melanesia suggests its introduction by a sea-faring people with an advanced stone technology in other respects, and a knowledge of agriculture. Stylistic features of some mortars suggest pottery prototypes, and of some clubheads, bronze prototypes. We would therefore posit a rather late date for the introduc- tion of this complex, both to Melanesia generally and to the Highlands, and assume that it did not precede the introduction of agriculture to the Highlands though it may have been introduced at the same time as a new crop (or crops) and new agricultural techniques. We therefore argue that these implements and weapons date from a period in Highlands prehistory when root crops (taro, yams, and Pueraria) or bananas were being cultivated, but when the natural vegetation of the area still pro- vided an important part of the diet, and before sweet potato cultivation per- mitted the extensive settlement of the higher-altitude areas. Possibly, the widespread manufacture and practical use of mortars and pestles ceased with the general improvement in food supplies brought about by intensive sweet potato cultivation, though the destruction by agricultural clearing of unculti- vated or semicultivated nut and seed bearing plants could also have rendered this technology obsolete. The manufacture and use of clubheads may also have ceased as a conse- quence of the same processes. Stone-headed clubs are reported to be very effec- tive weapons in surprise raids and ambushes, particularly in forested areas, where the objective is to do as much damage as possible to the enemy. As popu- lations built up in size in the Highlands, and large tracts were cleared of forest, it may be argued that patterns of warfare must have changed, with raids and ambushes giving way to some extent to the duelling and pitched battles fought with elaborate rules characteristic of many Highlands peoples in recent de- cades. It is also possible that the general-purpose axe replaced the club as a weapon when high quality polished stone blades became freely available. CONCLUSIONS Our general conclusions from the archeological evidence, although neces- sarily very tentative, are quite consistent with those we arrived at through examination of the non-archeological evidence. Archeology also throws some light on questions left open by the other inquiries. On the basis of archeology we make the following suggestions: (1) At least three phases of Highlands prehistory must be postulated. In Phase I the area was occupied by pre-neolithic people, lacking edge-ground</page><page sequence="35">The Prehistory 73 implements, who are unlikely to have made much progress with clearing the original forest. They must have been hunters and gatherers, although they may also possible have utilized sago in low-lying areas, or, if their entry was com- paratively recent, have practised limited horticulture. In this respect, it may be worth considering possible ways in which such a population could have entered the Highlands. The first is that it spread in through normal processes of population expansion and movement of a similar parent population in the lowlands. If this was the case, a very early date of occupation would at least be possible. A second possibility, which cannot at present be ruled out, is that the lower montane forest was one of the earliest zones of effective occupation by man in New Guinea, and was in fact generally occupied before the less salubrious lowland regions. Third, as Gusinde (1958: 563) and others have suggested, the earliest Highlanders could have been refu- gees, entering the area under pressure from more recent and technologically advanced peoples in the coastal lowlands. If this was the case, a relatively shallow time-depth for hunters and gatherers in the Highlands might be ex- pected. C14 dates for the sites excavated may ultimately throw light on this question. (2) In Phase II (which may, when more information is available, require reformulation in terms of sub-phases and local sequences) a number of artifacts and economic changes were introduced. These included the lenticular-sectioned axe-adze, agriculture, (or, at least, new crops), waisted flaked blades (possibly hoes or digging tools), and the pestle-mortar complex of artifacts. Our two excavations give little evidence that there were "migrations" of peoples into the Highlands who introduced these innovations; on the contrary, they sug- gest that the same people continued with additional equipment. However, the detailed similarities between some Highlands mortars, figurines and clubheads, and examples from northern coastal and lowland New Guinea, may possibly indicate immigration of peoples with skills in this kind of stone manufacture, and not simply diffusion of the objects themselves and the techniques for their manufacture. The distribution of the pestle-mortar complex outside the Highlands cer- tainly points to its introduction from either the North or the Northeast. There is no evidence as yet as to the direction or directions from which the other new elements of Phase II came. If they came from a number of directions, it is likely that they were not initially contemporaneous. However, the adoption of exten- sive agriculture would have been conditional on the presence of the edge- ground axe; on technological grounds, one may also assume that the makers of the pestles, mortars and clubheads also possessed edge-ground axes. (3) Phase III in Highlands prehistory is marked by the presence of the planilateral-sectioned axe-adze, which occurs later in time than the lenticular- sectioned axe-adze. It appears that the manufacture of this type of blade was restricted to the Wahgi and Jimi Valleys, but evidence of lowland manufacture of planilateral blades is lacking and thus it is impossible to suggest the deriva- tion of the Highlands type. Pottery-making was present in the Eastern High-</page><page sequence="36">74 New Guinea: The Central Highlands lands in this phase. These items were added to the existing assemblage of arti- facts in at least one part of the Highlands, suggesting that in general terms they may not mark a discontinuity in Highlands technology or peoples.12 (4) The introduction of intensive sweet potato cultivation, postulated as recent on ethno-botanical grounds, seems likely to have occurred in the third, most recent phase, and certainly not to have preceded this to any great extent. It is probable that the agricultural crops of Phase II, or at least its earlier part, were taro, bananas, yams, Pueraria and sugar cane; and unless climatic fluctu- ations there have been significant within the period of agriculture, populations during most or all of Phase II, and possibly the early part of Phase III-de- pending on when sweet potato cultivation developed-were mainly located at lower altitudes than they have been in recent times. (5) It seems highly probable that languages ancestral to those currently spoken in the Highlands were present in the area during Phase II. If the cul- tural continuity evidenced by the Kiowa excavation is to any extent represen- tative, then it is not impossible that languages ancestral to at least some con- temporary ones (for example, those of the Highlands Phylum but not exclu- sively the Highlands Stock, spoken by fringe groups to the north and south) were spoken in the area during Phase I, in putatively pre-agricultural times. (6) There is no archeological evidence for or against a single main migra- tion into and through the Highlands by either preagricultural or agricultural peoples, either from East to West or West to East. But in three respects there is support for the supposition, on linguistic, ethnological and ecological grounds, that the Eastern and Western Highlands have had rather different histories. First, the contemporary and recent (Phase III) axe-adze technology is different in the two areas. Second, the Yuku excavation (in the Western Highlands) does demonstrate a rather different cultural sequence from that at Kiowa (on the boundary between the Eastern and Western Highlands) although the two are reconcilable. Third, the concentration of pestles, mortars and clubheads in the West contrasts with the relative paucity of this material reported in the East. The elucidation of the prehistory of the Highlands must, it is clear, depend on further research in all relevant disciplines, both within the Highlands and elsewhere in Melanesia. Within the Highlands it is particularly necessary for archeologists to discover and excavate early open habitation sites. Although it is unlikely that these will be found from surface evidence, it should not be impossible to locate some if the cooperation of Papuans and Europeans who recover artifacts in agricultural and construction works can be systematically enlisted. Meanwhile, further excavations of rock shelter sites, which can more easily be found, are most desirable, while excavations in the immediate locality of axe-factories and salt springs should certainly be rewarding. Outside the Highlands, systematic archeological exploration of Northern coastal New Guinea and the Western Melanesian Islands should throw the greatest light, not only on the prehistory of the Highlands and other parts of New Guinea, but on that of the whole Western Pacific.</page><page sequence="37">The Prehistory 75 NOTES x S.

Womersley, Chief of the Division of Botany, Department of Forests, Lae, for information and for identifications of botanical material collected by R. Bulmer in 1963-64 and discussed in this paper, and Dr. L. J. Brass of the American Museum of Natural History who made a number of helpful suggestions relevant to the same data. This paper was originally submitted in June 1963. Minor revisions have been made in the light of more recent field work, especially with regard to ethnobotany and stone technology. The full range of historically relevant data obtained in 1963/64 by R. Bulmer in the Schrader Moun- tains and by J. M. A. Chappell, who, supported by the Wenner-Gren Foundation, made a three- month survey of Highlands axe quarries and other sources of stone artifacts, has yet to be an- alyzed, but we do not consider that this will significantly change our general conclusions. 2 One item of material culture which appears to have been introduced into the Highlands from more than one direction is the hour-glass drum. This was generally present in the Western Highlands at the time of European contact, though the finest specimens were either manufactured on the Southern fringe or traded in from the Papuan lowlands. According to Dr. J. B. Watson (personal communication) it was not present in parts of the Eastern Highlands, but was known to the peoples on the Northeastern fringe. 3 Schlesier (1961) in his very interesting discussion of New Guinea sago utilization argues persuasively that this must, on distributional evidence, be considered as well developed before the incursion of speakers of Austronesian languages. 4 Information on birds is taken from published reports, especially those of Mayr and Gilliard (1954) and Sims (1956), and from R. Bulmer's records (cf. 1961); information on mammals and reptiles is based on R. Bulmer's unpublished notes from the Western Highlands. 5 The New Zealand Maori lacked the bow, but were extremely successful bird hunters in forests not dissimilar to those of the New Guinea Highlands. However, they did have highly effi- cient wood-chopping and wood-working tools (c.f. Firth 1959: Chap. IV). 6 A short fence-screen in advanced secondary forest at 4,000 ft. in the Baiyer Valley was noted by R. Bulmer in 1955, but he was unable to discover whether this was a traditional hunting device or one introduced by laborers from other parts of New Guinea working at the nearby sawmill. 7 Records of Highlands material culture are Surprisingly incomplete, considering the amount of ethnographic research which has taken place in the region. In part this is due to the fact that nearly all professional studies have been made since the Second World War among peoples who had</page><page sequence="38">76 New Guinea: The Central Highlands turned from stone to steel tools ten or twenty years previously. However, it is unfortunately true that professional social anthropologists are notoriously lax in publishing, if not recording, details of material culture. With the exception of Williams' (1940) report on Kutubu, Gusinde's (1958) account of some Schrader Mountain peoples, and Wirz's (1951, 1952a, 1952b) publications, virtu- ally all detailed records from the Highlands derive from missionary collections and reports (espe- cially Tischner 1939, Aufenanger and H6ltker 1940, Vicedom and Tischner 1943/48, Nilles 1942/5, and Aufenanger 1946/49, 1953). Records are particularly inadequate from the Eastern Highlands District, beyond Chimbu and Gende. qur list is based on the accounts here cited, on personal information from J. N. Jennings (Kuthbu), P. L. Newman (Upper Asaro Valley), and J. B. Watson (Kainantu Region), and on our own observations in the Baiyer Valley, Wahgi Valley, Chuave region, and Kaironk Valley (Schrader Mountains). 8 If this is the case, the same ash showers should also contribute most valuably to the dating of evidence and interpretation of stratigraphy, once suitable sites are discovered. 9 The culture sequences as presented here are based primarily on the large stone artifacts. The small flake implements and bone artifacts are still being analyzed and the sequences may be further refined when this work is completed. 10 Some of these waisted tools could conceivably have been used for sago working. Although we lack precise descriptions of the simpler stone tools sometimes used in sago manufacture, it is ap- parent that a fair range of artifacts is used in different localities. 11 We are greatly indebted to many European residents of the Highlands for providing inform- ation or letting us examine their collections, and particularly to Messrs. N. Plant of Banz, P. Maxtone-Grahame of Minj, L. Wilson of Timin River, and to Dr. L. J. Brass of the American Museum of Natural History for providing unpublished records from the Kainantu region. There are important unpublished collections which we have been unable to examine, particularly from the Middle Lai, Baiyer, Wahgi and Jimi Valleys. However, these would not, we believe, signifi- cantly alter the general distributional pattern apparent from the records we have taken into ac- count. 12 It is of interest that the priority in time of the lenticular-, oval- or round-sectioned axe-adze over the quadrangular-sectioned one, as suggested by our excavations, is demonstrated strati- graphically in at least one other excavation in the Southwest Pacific region-that of the Niah Caves, Borneo (Harrisson 1959:5). This sequence has, of course, been postulated on distributional evi- dence by Heine-Geldern (1932) and many subsequent authors.</page></plain_text>
