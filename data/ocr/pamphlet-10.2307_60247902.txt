The following Discussion originated in a challenge to discuss religious subjects, repeatedly addressed to clergymen and ministers by Iconoclast. A large number of working men who were aware of the publication of this challenge, and who had heard the Rev. W. Barker deliver lectures on Atheism and kindred topics to the Clerkenwell Working Men's Christian Union, ex¬ pressed an earnest desire that the subject might be/brought to the notice of Mr. Barker, and that he should meet Iconoclast in discussion. This request was preferred to the Rev. W. Barker, who consented to meet Iconoclast, and appointed Mr. C. J. Whibmore, the Hon. Sec. of the Clerkenwell Working Men's Christian Union, to act as his secretary during the Debate. Iconoclastj appointed." Mr. J. P. Adams to act as his secretary, and empowered him to draw up the subjects for discussion. The subjects were accordingly drawn up by Mr. Adams, and accepted by Mr. Barker without alteration. The Debate occupied six evenings in September, 1862. During the first two evenings a chairman was appointed for each speaker; J. Stabb, Esq., Treasurer of the Midnight Mission, acting for Mr. Barker, and Mr. J. B. Bebbington for Iconoclast; James Harvey, Esq., presiding as umpire by joint consent. After the second evening the remaining four meetings were placed entirely under the control of Mr. Harvey, as chairman and umpire; and both disputants gladly join the Committee in here tendering their best thanks to Mr. Harvey for his able and impartial conduct throughout the Debate. The attendance averaged nearly twelve hundred persons each evening, each one paying twopence on entering the Hall j and the Committee believe that nearly a thousand persons heard the whole of the Debate. After all expenses were defrayed, a surplus of twenty pounds was handed over to the Lord Mayor of London for the Lancashire Relief Eund; that object having been approved by both parties as worthy of joint support.</page><page sequence="4">CONTENTS.

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1862. Subject—Are the representations of the Deity in the Bible irrational and derogatory Me. Harvey:—Ladies and Gentlemen, you are all well aware of the object for which you are met to-night; and I need not occupy your time at any length by way of introduction. I am here very unexpectedly to myself. I am a stranger to both gentlemen who will address you. Till this evening, I do not know that I ever spoke to either of them; and when I was requested to act as umpire on this occasion, I was taken entirely by surprise. I hesitated to accept the post, first, because I did not wish to appear in so prominent a position, and next, because I thought that some one more able to discharge the duties of umpire might easily have been found. However, this argument did not weigh with your committee, and I agreed to accept the post on the condition that my appointment might be mutually satisfactory to both parties. I have had the assurance that such is the case, and therefore my duties ought to be very light. That, however, rests pretty much with yourselves; and I ask of you that you will be kind enough to support me in securing a fair and full hearing for each of the gentlemen who shall address you. It is quite E</page><page sequence="6">2 3I0DEEX ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. right and necessary that authority should be maintained by some one in conducting a public meeting, but without the support of the audience the Chairman is utterly powerless. Having accepted the responsibility of umpire on this occasion, I pledge you my word that I will act to the best of my judgment with the strictest impartiality. Further to secure this object I will ask, with your permission, two things—one of the speakers themselves, and one of you. Of the speakers I will ask, that they will keep them¬ selves to the subjects announced for discussion, and not indulge in personalities: that they will not impugn each other's motives. Each individual, of course, has a right to entertain an individual opinion, and no one has a right to question the sincerity with which he entertains it. Of you I will ask, that you will bo good enough to hear patiently and quietly, for the full length of time, each gentleman on each occasion, and to suppress all ex¬ pressions of approval or disapproval. Such expressions frequently lead to disorder—always to loss of time. Perhaps it will he too much to expect that there will be no manifestations of approval or disapproval, but at any rate kindly reserve them till the con¬ clusion of the speeches. You will then not interrupt the speaker, and shorten the time at his disposal, which would he unfair both to him and to others. You will probably hear some sentiments uttered and arguments used with which you will not agree ; but you have come here with the full consciousness that such is to bo the case, because there is to bo a discussion upon controverted points. If there was no difference of opinion, there would be no discussion; hut as there is difference of opinion, it has been thought that fair, open, and free discussion may be the means of eliciting the truth. I presume that that is theVbject of this discussion— for no other object am I here—and therefore I trust you will give a fair hearing to both parties, not seeking to serve party purposes, or merely to obtain a victory, but seeking to elicit the truth, in the full assurance that the truth only is good for man and worthy of his pursuit. I rely upon your forbearance with me, and I will do my best to secure a fair hearing for each gentleman who is to address you, simply remarking, that if Ave keep these points in mind we may have a pleasant and profitable meeting for us all. (Cheers.) I now leave the Chairmen ,to introduce the respective gentlemen to you. Me. Harvey concluded by stating the subject of discussion.</page><page sequence="7">FIRST EVENING. Me. Stabb :—I have great pleasure, friends, in introducing to you the Kev. W. Barker, who will open the discussion. Me. Baekee, who was received with cheers, said:—I am quite prepared to commence; but I understood that some one would briefly state the circumstances which have led to this discussion. I wish there to be a thorough understanding on this point before we commence. Iconoclast :—I object to any statement except the statement of the subject of discussion. I know of no circumstance other than the public know, and I refuse to hear of any other. The Umpiee :—I think it will be best to proceed to the dis¬ cussion at once on the merits of the case. Mr. Baekee :—If that is to he so, I shall claim my privilege as one of the speakers to state them myself. I wish it simply to be understood that this challenge did not emanate from me. I am told that Iconoclast has repeatedly, on public occasions, and before large audiences, stated that he has challenged the various ministers of London to meet him in discus&amp;iun on these contro¬ verted points, and that no response was forthcoming. I under¬ stand that my name has been made use of in connection with these challenges—if it be not so, of course I stand corrected; but as the result of such information conveyed to me, and at the earnest request of several Christian gentlemen, I agreed to accept the position which I hold to-night, and which I shall hold, if my life is spared, on the subsequent evenings of this discussion. I make this statement, because I do not believe so thoroughly in the utility of public discussions as to seek them; but at the same time I do not shrink from them if Providence throws them in my way. I believe that it was a call in the providence of God to come here, and therefore I have come. One thing I will say, that inasmuch as the challenge did not emanate from me, I ought not to be the first speaker. Of this, however, I am not going to complain; it may have its advantages as well as its disadvantages, and there¬ fore we shall take the thing as it is, and make the best of it. The question has been read to you by the umpire. I come here to discuss it, not assuming to be the representative of Christians in general—that would be an assumption on my part which I am not prepared for—but simply as an individual believing that the Bible does not teach anything derogatory to the character of God, or irrational, if reason be rightly influenced in forming her conclusions as to the statements of the Bible. I believe, too, that there are many honest doubters; and because it is possible to con- B 2</page><page sequence="8">4 modeen atheism and the bible. vince an honest doubter, I have placed myself in the position, this evening, of attempting such conviction on such minds. Now, the proposition is one which necessarily throws aside some things of considerable importance, and which are disputed points between the secularist and the Christian. We have not this evening to do with the divine authority of the Bible. That is a point which we have no right to touch upon, properly speaking, if we abide by our proposition. We have not to do with the authenticity of the various books of the Scriptures. It is a far less important question to us, even if we had to do that, to know who wrote such and such a book, than to know that the book as a whole has the stamp of divinity upon it. We are not to discuss the various questions arising in connection with different manu¬ scripts, etc., nor yet the merits of the English translation. As a question, it may come in occasionally in this debate—it is hardly possible, indeed, to keep it out—but it forms no integral part of our debate to-night. We are to take the whole book just as we find it. It comes to us in a certain character. We read certain things in it, and we are to examine whether or not those things are derogatory to the character of the Being it speaks of, or contrary to the right reason of man. Now, this preliminary statement I feel to be sufficient, this evening, on that head. If my opponent wishes to know whether I intend to confine myself in this discussion to the English version of the Scriptures, I simply answer, that I reserve to myself the liberty of referring to the original if I please, and I concede to him, of course, the same liberty. At the same time I shall depre¬ cate every unnecessary reference to it, either on my part or on his part, because it will tend to complicate this discussion, and in a great measure prevent the clear perception on the part of the audience of our meaning, and of the truth of the propositions we are to discuss. I would say next, that the Deist, who is a believer of course in God, in common with the Christian, admits what we generally, for the sake of distinction, call the natural attributes of God, and also the essential spirituality of his nature. By the natural attributes of God we mean such as the eternity of his being—his omniscience—his omnipresence—his spirituality of nature, and the immutability of his character. These properties, it is con¬ tended, belong to God by an innate necessity, so that they form the essential part of his being. Without these essential elements the being whom we call God could not in my judgment be God.</page><page sequence="9">FIRST EVENING. Deism takes still higher ground, in common with Christianity; namely, that there are certain moral attributes in the Divine character—or, in other words, that there are certain properties in the Divine nature, in addition to a mere constitutional quality or necessity. These attributes presuppose moral agency, or a condition of being, including understanding, reason, conscience, and freedom of will. These features of character render it neces¬ sary that we should find in the nature of God everything that is lovely and noble. We may define these attributes to be benevolence, justice, mercy, truth, wisdom, and holiness. So far, the voice of reason on the part of the Deist, and the voice of revelation as interpreted by the Christian, are in perfect harmony. At this stage of the discussion I shall turn for a few moments to some quotations illustrating the fact, that the Bible teaches that there are such attributes in the character of God, both natural and moral, and of course I am prepared to give chapter and verse for everything I state as being from the Bible, on this and on all other occasions. We find concerning the Deity, for instance, the truth, that he is invisible to mortal eyes. " God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth." He is " the King eternal, immortal, invisible; the only wise God, who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach, which no man hath seen or can see." We are further told, that " We have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape." " To whom, then, are wo to liken God, or with what likeness will ye compare him " Upon the incomprehensi¬ bility and infinite greatness of God the Scriptures testify most clearly. " Behold, God is great, and we know him not." " Touching the Almighty, wo cannot find him out. He is excellent in power and judgment, and in plenty of justice." " Canst thou by searching find out God Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection ?" " Great things doeth he which we comprehend not—great things past finding out—yea, wonders without number." Respecting the self-existence of His being, the Scriptures say, " Thus saith the Lord, I am that I am." " The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Where is the house that ye build unto mo " "Am I a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God afar off P Can any hide himself in secret places, that I shall not see him Do not I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord." That God is eternal is stated in the passages I have quoted. In the revealed words of Scripture he says further, " I am that I am ; this is my name for ever; this is my memorial unto all generations." " I lift</page><page sequence="10">6 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE, up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever." This truth ' was celebrated in ancient times by the people of God. " Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth or the world, from everlasting to everlasting thou art God." I Respecting his unchangeableness. the Scriptures say, " Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I am the Lord; I change not; my counsels shall stand, and I will do my pleasure." " Hearken unto mo, my people, and give ear unto me, O my nation. Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look to the earth beneath, for the heavens \ shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old, like a i garment. They that dwell therein shall die in like manner. My 1 salvation shall be for ever; my righteousness shall not be ' abolished." Of his independence of all other beings, the Scrip¬ tures state, " He made the world, and all things that are therein, seeing that he is the Lord of heaven and earth, dwelling not in 1 temples made with hands; in whose hand is the breath of every living thing, in whoso hand are all our ways : who holdeth our soul in life, and suffercth not our feet to be moved." Respecting | his infinite knowledge, we are told that " God is light, and with ' him is no darkness at all." " His understanding is infinite." " Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world, neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight." Respecting his wisdom: " Where shall wisdom be found Whore is the place of understanding, seeing it is hid from the eye of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air? God understandeth the way thereof; he knoweth the place thereof: for he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven; to make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure." That his wisdom is original—self-derived— " The Lord of hosts is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in work¬ ing." " He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength." Respecting his power—" Sing unto the Lord, bless his name ; show forth his salvation from day to day; declare his glory among the heathen —his wonders among all people." " The Lord is great, and greatly to be praised." " Give unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory and strength." " Ascribe ye strength unto God; for his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds." And so I might go on, quoting innumerable passages from the Scriptures respecting the various attributes of his character, but I feel I shall not have time to do that, at any rate in my first speech.</page><page sequence="11">FIRST EVENING. And now let me make a few remarks. First, the Bible we believe is the only book which furnishes us with any definite or rational account of the First Great Cause. Neither the popular nor the philosophic theology of the heathens contains such exalted views of God as are given to us in dnine revelation. His character and claims have a place assigned them here which no human composition ever assigned to them, and which will be looked for in vain from the conceptions of uninspired men. There are aspects of the Deity in Scripture to which the unaided reason of man could never have attained, at least in so perfect a degree as he receives those truths from the Bible ; one is the pure spirituality of his nature; the next is his omniscience and omni¬ presence ; and the last, the fact of his triune existence in connec¬ tion with his unity. There is nothing in nature alone that gives man the idea of pure spirituality, our opponents themselves being witnesses to that fact; and this acknowledged incompetency of the human mind to originate and conceive of it is powerful evidence to us, that the idea as found in the Bible must be of God—that it is not the result of the intellectual fancies of men nor of the dreamy superstition of priests. The Scriptures tell us that Jehovah fills all space—penetrates all substance—pervades all mind—and is equally present with all his creatures at all times. That human intellect could have originated this idea our enemies themselves say is impossible. This question is not irrelevant, for the reason of man has tried its skill again and again upon the subject, and with what result? The pantheism of the heathen world, which makes everything God and God everything! And so with regard to the triune existence. There are, it is true, some traces of this doctrine still lingeiing among the old nations in their literature and sacred books, but in no writings will you find the same unbiassed simplicity in the statement of the plurality in unity, combined with such majesty and purity of conception, as are found in the Bible. With regard to the moral character of God, the Scriptures, as you will ha\e seen from the few quotations I have given, make no uncertain souud. Thus we find none of the absurdities of pantheism about God of different natures, with dispositions con¬ tradictory and incompatible. The attitude of the God of the Bible towards virtue and vice, which so inseparably link them¬ selves to our happiness or misery, is such as to command our highest veneration ; for with manifest consistency and true dignity that book deelaies that God '• blesses the righteous, and with favour</page><page sequence="12">8 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. compasses him as with a shield," while with the wicked " ho is angry every day." The Scriptures magnify the unbending recti¬ tude of the Divine character, while they celebrate his good¬ ness to all creatures he has made. The holiness, benevolence, and mercy of the Deity may be called the grand subjective features of his being, acting and reacting upon the eternal mind, and constituting its perennial exercise, its endless ^blessedness. His other moral attributes—as justice, wisdom, and truth—are reflex, those by which he is most easily seen and known by his intelligent creatures. They are the expressed aspects of his moral being, and are to be found embodied in his works and providence, sometimes apart from, at other times in connection with, his natural attributes; but in either case they are the chief glory of his nature, and the chief foundation of his sovereign rule among all responsible agents. The representations of God in the Bible are twofold, both in object and in method. Their object is twofold, namely, to tell us what God is in himself, and what he is in rela¬ tion to his creatures. Of course the former of these statements must he necessarily somewhat obscure to our minds, as, for in¬ stance, where it says—•" I am that I am,"—" God is a Spirit,"— "The king eternal, immortal, invisible,"—" God is light, and in him is no darkness at all." The latter are much more copious and varied, and have reference to the relations which God sustains to us as creator, benefactor, moral ruler, and also redeemer. The mode of revealing is twofold. There are many sublime, and, as far as possible, abstract statements of the nature and relations of God, and in this respect no book can for a moment surpass or equal the Bible ; but there are also many figurative representations of Deity which, fairly and honestly interpreted, cause the subject to appear more grand, and also to bo more useful to the ordinary range of human capacity, than it' they were not of a figurative character. I may not of course presume to know the exact course which my opponent will take to-night in trying to show that the representations of Deity in the Bible are irrational and dero¬ gatory^— whether he may bring a list of objections in detail from texts of Scripture, which a fair and ingenuous method of interpretation would suffice to remove, I know not. This I know, however, is done by secular advocates in the present day, but it is simply a revival of stale objections which have long since been answered. He may try to meet the arguments I have put forward by some metaphysical or moral objections to the system of creation, providence, and moral government attributed to the God of the Scrip-</page><page sequence="13">FIRST EVENING. 9 tures. We may, perhaps, be told, that while God is spoken of as if he were all-wise and just, yet in other cases he is described as if he were a local tutelar deity, and that such statements are irre¬ concilable with the dictates of reason, and derogatory to the Divine nature. We may be told, that the relations between the Deity and the subjects of his moral rule are derogatory to his character, and in a striking manner contrary to the reason of man. Of course, if this method be pursued, we must demand proof of the validity of the objection before we can take notice of it. Or we may be afflicted with various objections to Bible truth which have no possible connection with the proposition we are to-night dis¬ cussing. The laws of the Mosaic and Levitical economy may be set in opposition to the views of the Divine character that are found in the Scriptures at large ; and an ineffectual effort may be made to show that the Mosaic doctrines about marriage, slavery, and other kindred things, are contrary to right reason, and repulsive to moral sense—for this is a method of reasoning not at all unusual at the present time. It may even be attempted to affix the odium and blame of the inconsistencies and occasional immoralities of Bible characters upon the nature of God, as though man were not a responsible agent, but a mere passive machine, moved like an automaton by the hands of another, and according to his imperious will. Or he may pursue a more refined mode of objection, and contend that the representations of God in the Bible are incom¬ prehensible as far as they relate to the character of Deity, and that, therefore, ho finds it impossible to accept the representations of the Dhine character as they exist in the Bible. We will, how- e\ er, as far as we are concerned, lay down a few simple proposi¬ tions, which we will do our best to maintain in the course of this argument. Our first proposition is, that the representations of the nature and attributes of the Deity contained in the Scriptures are in perfect accordance with the unbiassed reason and moral sense of mankind. Reason, if we may take the utterances of sceptics as the echo of her voice, demands a Being of wisdom, benevolence, and holiness, and loudly complains that she cannot find such a God. We shall find also that her claims and requirements are consistent with right feeling, and that God should be the proper cause and centre of human happiness, unless some other elements destroy the bond of sympathy necessary to conduce to that end. Man's self-ism and his bondage to external, material influences disqualify him from fully knowing God, and therefore he cannot B 3</page><page sequence="14">10 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. acknowledge his image when portrayed either by the Bible or by the light of reason. Our second proposition is, that the figurative language employed by the sacred writers to describe the nature and attributes of God, is in perfect accordance with the essence of all language, and com¬ prises the purest specimens of the use of figures in that or any subsequent period. God, we may be told, is said to have bodily parts assigned to him, as eyes and hands, and so on ; and, we answer, beautiful imagery too What more exalted symbol of power could you have than the human hand—of intelligence, omniscience, and omnipresence, than the human eye But God is invested by theologians with human passions, and this, it is said, is irrational and derogatory. We answer, that these anthropomorphic features of the Deity in Scrip¬ ture are incidental, and intended to assist the mind of man through his senses. R.eason herself has endorsed this method by the uni¬ versal consent of nations. The nature of spiritual, invisible, and divine things is set forth in the mythology, philosophy, and divinity of all the olden nations by this self-same means. Our third proposition is, that the attitude which the sacred writers represent God as assuming towards evil and sin, is wholly consistent with his moral attributes in their relations to the rights and obligations of moral and accountable beings. He creates their physical and mental powers, each one of which is perfect in itself. He gives them reasonable laws to govern them, as free and respon¬ sible agents—points out distinctly the advantages of virtue and the sad consequences of vice. Fourthly, we observe, that those representations which point to the mode of the Divine existence, though above the comprehension of reason, cannot properly be said to bo contrary to it, and should be accepted by us as matters of simple revelation and faith. Before we can pronounce a thing contrary to reason, we must know the sum and power of all its parts, just as we know that two and three are not four, because they are not equal. But the case before us is not of this nature. It is one in which we see the evidence of the existence of a Being, the phenomena of whose life are boldly depicted in the world of nature, and emphatically declared in revelation, but whose mode of being is beyond us. But these facts, nevertheless, are powerful evidence to us of the truth of such statements respecting him. And my last proposition is, that the representations and proofs of the Divine love and righteousness found in the New Testament,</page><page sequence="15">FIRST EVENING. 11 give increasing lustre to the Divine character, and entitle it to the devout worship and adoration of intelligent creatures. I have tried in this brief manner to open the question which is to be debated this evening; and I feel convinced that no fair means will enable any objector, whoever he may be, to show that the Word of God is contrary to the reason of man, when that reason is fairly and rightly exercised; and especially no one will be able to show that the representations of Deity in the Scrip¬ tures are as a whole inconsistent with themselves. I believe it is a fair rule of interpretation with regard to any and every book, that you shall not form a judgment as to the opinions of the writer by any separate statement, but by the book as a whole; and if you thus deal with the Word of God in forming a judgment of the character of God, you will find that the decision you arrive at, as a whole, is in perfect harmony with all your best feelings, with your wisest and most profound thoughts, and certainly is in perfect harmony with the teachings of the book itself. We may be told, perhaps, that the Bible is not perfect, because there is a kind of development in that book of the idea and notion of God. We may be told that the God of the New Testament is a more perfect being, upon the whole, than the God of the Old Testament. Our answer to this will be forthcoming when it is required. We simply wish to know whether, supposing such were the fact, it can be shown to be inconsistent with the doctrine now laid down, that the Divine character taken from the Word of God, as a whole, is consistent with itself and with right reason. Granting that there may be a development in the representations of the Divine character, to us this appears perfectly consistent with right reason to begin with; for the human mind, in the first instance, being unacquainted with Divine objects, and more especially with those attributes of character pertaining to the Divine nature, requires that some moans of instruction should be adopted which would admit of development; and you find a corresponding development, therefore, in the statements of the Scriptures respecting God's character. God did not all at once unfold the resources of his being to man. He did not all at once tell man precisely what his nature was. He told him sufficient to make him accountable to the law which was given him to govern his actions, and that was all that was required. But as time rolled on, and the necessities of the case, if we may so speak, enlarged themselves, then there came forth from the Word of God statements in advance, not in prin¬ ciple, but in detail, of the statements which had been given at mffBmi -t</page><page sequence="16">12 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. first. If, then, we are to know God as he is revealed in the Scriptures, we must take his character as wo find it in the whole book, and not in a part. The Umpiee here called " Time," and Mr. Barker immediately resumed his seat. Iconoclast said:—Friends, the few words relating to the circumstances out of which these debates have arisen, were so fairly put, that they hardly need any explanation or any addition on my part. It is true that I have challenged the clergy of London and of the provinces to debate. So far I admit, that I have given a general and a wide, and, if I had known individuals, should have given an individual challenge to every clergyman I thought likely to meet me. I had not the pleasure of the acquaint¬ ance of Mr. Barker, and, therefore, had not the opportunity of addressing a personal invitation to himself, though his name had been mentioned to me. I am, however, glad to have the oppor¬ tunity of meeting him this evening, and shall be glad to have an opportunity of meeting any other clergyman who would think he was included as I intend to include him, whoever he may be, in the challenge formerly given, and now again repeated by me. The question for discussion this evening has been read to you by the Umpire. It is, " Arc the representations of Deity in the Bible irrational and derogatory?" and our friend has been kind enough to tell you that he deprecates any unnecessary reference to any¬ thing but the authorized English version; and I tell you, for the purpose of to-night, the Bible is the authorized English version. It is the Bible by statute; it is the Bible which it is a penal offence to deny as a Divine revelation; and without some special exception, it is the Bible which my friend is bound to defend here to-night—the Bible taught in the colleges, the Bible preached in the churches; and the moment he is obliged to turn to any other version to predicate the rationality of the description of Deity, that moment he admits that the descriptions of Deity contained in this book are irrational, and cannot be defended on the face of it. Now our friend has endeavoured to some extent to anticipate what he thought might be the possible course of my speech, and there are two words out of his very quiet, very kindly, and other¬ wise unobjectionable speech, to which I think I ought to take exception. He speaks of certain arguments brought forward before, and likely to be brought forward again, he thinks, to-night, as " coarse and stale, and refuted hundreds of times." Permit me to tell him, first, that it is time enough to speak of the character</page><page sequence="17">fiest evening. 13 of -each objection as that objection is delivered to him; and next, that if the refutation has been given one hundred times, the giving it one time more will not weaken the refutation, and will add to the knowledge of those who have hitherto not known it. Our friend said he had opened the question. I confess I do not think he has. He has been kind enough, in round phrases, to tell us several things about the Bible, and about the God of the Bible; but while he said he should quote chapter and verse, it appeared to me that he rather moulded and ran together separate phrases and passages, extracted, without reference to the context, to make up the character of the God he wished, rather than the character of God the Bible portrays. I may be wrong in that; and the best test of it will be by putting text against text, instance against instance, and see what we make of them ourselves. Now, in dealing with the question, I should have had some difficulty, had it not been for the course our friend has taken; because I admit that to myself, an Atheist, I should have found considerable difficulty in suggesting a fitting standard by which to decide what attributes of Deity were derogatory to him, what representations of him might bo deemed irrational. But my friend has been kind enough to favour us with a standard which we may take, and by that standard we shall be enabled to deal with the subject; and if that standard be an unfitting one, it is our friend alone who will be to blame, and not I, who follow in the course he has mapped out for inc. And mark, he says—and I thank him for it—we must take the Bible as a whole—we must not judge by isolated parts and passages of it—we must judge of it altogether. We must take the tout ensemble from the beginning to the end. For instance, if you find one passage of love, one passage breathing mercy, one passage breathing kindliness, and ten breathing hatred, ten breathing murder, ten breathing war, then, according to my friend's own description of the book, as nine-tenths of it would be bad, so you judge the whole; you take the majority of the descriptions, and you will condemn it, if the majority may negate the question, or affirm it. Now, we will begin with the history of creation, as found in the Bible. My friend will cer¬ tainly not object to my taking the initial series of events recorded there. If God were all-wise, he would have known iu that creation how to have guarded against the possibility of that moral evil of which our friend spoke : if ho were all-powerful, he would have been able to have guarded against it; and these are, according to aur friend, necessary attributes of Deity. He</page><page sequence="18">14 MODEEN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. spoke of them as being, if I remember rightly, attributes of Deity, by some innate necessity. I confess I do not know the meaning of those two words coupled with Deity, but they may be very proper, and our friend is better able to speak on that point than I am, for the purpose of this evening's debate; but he went on to tell you, that if one of them were taken away, then the being from whom they were taken was no longer God; and if I am successful to-night, in any one instance, in showing you that the God of the Bible is not all-wise, not all-powerful, not all-good, not all-merciful, not all-just, then, according to my friend's definition, he is not God, and the revelation of such a Deity found in the Bible would be irrational and derogatory to him. Now, in the account of the creation what do you find You find man created, and placed within reach of a tree which God never intended should be for food; which God, all-wise, knew how to prevent being partaken of as food; which God, all-powerful, could have always prevented man from partaking of; which God, all-good, would have desired to have prevented man par¬ taking of. And yet in the Bible we are told that this tree, never intended by God to be eaten, was good for food, a tree pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise. Now, I submit, that if God intended this to be eaten, and made man, intending that he should eat it, God was not all-good, and the representation of him there is not only irrational but derogatory. If he did not intend man to eat it, and made it good for food, then he was not all-wise; for he adopted a course likely to frustrate his own ends, and that is a representation again that is irrational and derogatory. i I pass from the account of the creation to the fall consequent upon it. God omniscient foreknew the partaking of the fruit of the tree; but omnipotent fore-knowledge is fore-ordainment; and if God foie-ordained the plucking of the fruit of the tree which God foreknew would be followed by his inevitable curse on human kind, descended from the sinner, then God was not only not all-good, but was entirely wicked, cruel, and unmerciful, laying a trap for frail man to fall into, and punishing him when he had fallen into the trap. God made alike the crime, the criminal, and the punishment for the crime. And that this is so no student of the Bible can possibly doubt. Turn to Isaiah—a text my friend will be familiar with, and you will find that the Deity of the Bible, the only Deity we are discussing to-night, represents himself as saying—" I make peace, and create evil—I,</page><page sequence="19">FIRST EVENING. 15 the Lord, do all these things." How can evil issue from entire good How can evil issue from infinite goodness The very phrase is a paradox. But our friend says—"Oh! there maybe some things beyond your comprehension ; it does not necessarily follow therefore that they are not reasonable;" and he gave a very curious illustration of it. He says, " We know, for instance, that two and three are not four, because two and three are not equal." That was not good logic; why you might have two and a-quarter and one and three-quarters, which would make four, and yet not be equal. Our friend probably meant to give a correct illustration, and I will give him the benefit therefore of what he meant, rather than of what he said. But who is to be the judge in this debate of what is out of our reason or not Take the familiar instance of the Indian prince, who did not understand the modus operandi through which water became ice. That was out of his reason. Our friend, if arguing that it was done by God by miracle, would have told him, " Being out of your reason you must not investigate into it; it is beyond it altogether." I tell our friend in this debate, he must not shelter himself by dealing with any proposition contained in the Bible as beyond our reason. It is a revelation, if at all, from God to man. But to what To man's reason; and if it is not a revelation to his reason, it is an irrational revelation, and a revelation without reason is irrational on the face of it. Then take shortly after the following account of the deluge. It is not our purpose, nor would it be our duty, in this debate, to discuss the probability or not of this event. Let us look at the event as though it were truly related. What is the deluge What was it preceded by? Grief on the part of Deity, and repentance that he had made man. But what does grief ensue upon Upon the knowledge of an event. But God omniscient foreknew man's wickedness; and God must therefore have grieved at that which his omnipotence could have prevented; and his whole grief must have been a sublime farce, and a sublime mockery perpetrated upon mankind. Let us follow this out a little further. Let us see the deluge—what is it? An act of punishment—for what? All wise legislation—legislation of a punitive character—is adapted not to the retribution of crime past, but to the prevention of crime yet to come. Yet this deluge is a mere punitive vengeance for crime past; while all mankind, and the whole animal creation, with very slight exceptions, fall victims, not to the justice of the All-just, not to the mercy of the All-merciful, but to the vindictive rage of</page><page sequence="20">16 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. a God who has repented that he has made man, who has grieved him in his heart, and who is determined now to revenge himself for his grief on man by destroying him. Is not this irrational and derogatory Do you tell me of God's justice? What part have the fowls of the air? what part have all the beasts of the field, in the thought of man's heart What part have the little children, just born into the world, in all this My friend has talked of the mercy of God. Why, if there were no other representation of God than this, it would be sufficient to sj;amp his whole character with cruelty and injustice. But let us pass from the deluge, not omitting to notice that God, although he had made the earth one huge slaughter-house, yet requires sacrifice—yet permits more animals to be offered up in sacrifice to him; and while the carcasses burn, and the fumes ascend to heaven—God in heaven—God who is everywhere, ac¬ cording to our friend, but is in heaven, then smells a sweet savour, and makes a covenant with men and boasts that he will not do what he has done any more, and that covenant made, why ?— because the thought of man's heart is evil continually. The punishment has been futile; the punishment has been useless; the whole of this tremendous slaughter has been thrown away, which was the act of a grieving, a penitent, a revengeful God. I assert that this is the most irrational and derogatory representation of Deity that can be put before you, and marks, if it marks anything, the utterance of the mythology of an ignorant and barbarous age, and not the revelation of God to man. I pass from the deluge to that event which immediately succeeds it—the erection of the Tower of Babel. The only clear notion of this affair that any one can derive, is that God, who was somewhere above, heard that the people, who were in the plain of Shinar, intended to build a city, and a tower whose top should reach to heaven; and God, who heard that, deemed it was possible that the people might do it, and came down to see whether the thing were true or not, and, if it were, to plan some means of preventing it. Our friend talked of God as a wise counsellor. God the wise counsellor everywhere, heard a story up in heaven, and, as he puts no trust in his angels, and charges his servants with folly, probably unable to rely upon the correctness of the story reported to him, he, who is everywhere, comes down to somewhere, where he always was, and to which there was no necessity for his coming. How can this account of the building of Babel, and of God's</page><page sequence="21">FIRST EVENING. 17 conduct in relation to it, be defended as either rational or con¬ sistent with the character of Deity Now take another statement. Our friend pictured to us God as deciding fairly between actors upon earth. Take the case of Jacob and of Esau. On the one side a vile chicaner; on the one side a mean, cowardly trickster; on the one side a man whose fraud did not hesitate even at his father's dying pillow; who could He to the man whose breath was just escaping, and extract a blessing from him, which the all-just God in heaven endorsed, though obtained by fraud, and helped to cheat the honest brother out of, who was no party to such deception. Is not this irrational Is not this derogatory I am here to-night to impeach this account of Jacob and Esau—to impeach the conduct of Deity, judging this to be the true relation of it. I read here God says, " I have loved Jacob;" Jacob the liar; Jacob the cheat; Jacob the knave; Jacob the coward; Jacob the man who quibbled and made a bargain with God before he decided as to whether he would worship him or not; " him have I loved, and hated Esau;" Esau the honest man; Esau who, although moved by passion when robbed and cheated, when his calmer reason gained the sway, forgave his brother and lo\edhim, and gave him his protection; and yet God says, " Iliin I hated." This is God's conduct towards the honest man and towards the thief; towards the liar and the truthful man. I say, whether this be rational or not, it is derogatory to the character of the Deity wherever recorded. I pass on now to another instance : the sanctification of a jjriest to be the leader of God's chosen people—one Aaron. Some of you may remember that Aaron was loft in charge of the Jews, while Moses, on the mountain, was with God. God made provi¬ sion for the protection—God made provision for the perpetuation of the priesthood in the house of Aaron. God regulated the number and the character of the flesh forks which Aaron should have the light to put in the sacred pot when the people offered their offer¬ ings, and God took every care of the personal and temporal welfare of Aaron. At the very moment while God was doing this, if this account in the Bible be true, Aaron was conniving with the people in the plain below, while God was saying this on the mountain to Moses, and must have known what Aaron was doing. Aaron, on the plain below, was collecting the gold of the people, and making a calf which they might worship; and God, who w as so much occupied at the moment with Moses that he could pay no</page><page sequence="22">18 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. attention, suddenly wakes to the knowledge of the fact, and then, what does he say He says, " Let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot, and that I may destroy this people whom I have created." Is it rational to imagine God saying that? We may imagine two men, the one about to struggle with the other, and a third interposing, and one of them saying, "You shall not; let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot, and that I may accomplish my purpose—that I may slay my opponent." But here we have the infinite Deity; here we have the omnipotent Deity; here we have the all-wise Deity, angry with his people, determined to kill them (or else the whole thing is a farce). We have him saying to Moses, " Let mo alone, that I may do as I want to the people." Is not this irrational and derogatory I tell you the thing is irrational in the extreme. Our friend may tell us, as I understood him to, that there is some development in the character of the Deity in the Bible suited to the people, and suited to the age, and he probably expects me to say the Deity of the New Testament is an improve¬ ment on the Deity of the Old. I shall say nothing of the kind; on the contrary, I shall allege, that while the Deity of the Old confined himself to murdering people here, saying to his people, " Smite them utterly; kill every male, and every maiden that hath not known man," it was reserved for the finer and keener wickedness of the New Testament to burn men for ever and for ever. I pass to the story of the plagues. Pharaoh was the ruler of Egypt. God had remembered his people whom he had forgotten, in slavery (he who can never forget!) and had determined to rescue them from the thraldom into which this favoured people had fallen; and as ho had determined to rescue them, he hardens the heart of the king who has them in captivity, that he should not let them go. Is this rational or no Would it be rational, if I wished you to leave this hall and then held you down in the seat, and prevented you from moving But, unfortunately, it is not merely the unreasonableness of the story, there is much worse follows. Under God's command, himself an unwilling criminal, himself an unfortunate offender, compelled by God, ho keeps them slaves, and then God, having sent many a plague, destroys the first-born of the land, down to the captive in the dungeon, and the slave in the mill. The king on the throne had committed a crime, which neither of these—the prison captive nor the poor serf—had any part in. Nay, the king on the throne had not committed the crime, for if God were in heaven, God in high heaven was the</page><page sequence="23">riEST EVENING. 19 high criminal above all, who had made the king commit the crime, and then murdered the unfortunate offspring of those who had no share or part in it. I put it to you whether this is not irrational and derogatory. I pass on, because there are many other points, and my time is waning. I will take one more for my friend to wind up with. I will ask him, is it rational to suppose God visiting Abraham in the heat of the day, partaking with him of a dressed calf, tender and good, tolling him he has come because some story of Sodom and Gomorrah has reached him; because he has heard some story of Sodom and Gomorrah which he does not know to be true, and which he is determined to have explained? I ask you, again, are not these things irrational? Are these objections coarse Are they stale Then I have revived them, because this staleness is, at present, the law of England, which I have determined to do my best to shake, and induce people to see as I see. The Umpire here called " Time." Me. Barker :—I shall take no notice at all of the opening remarks, except to say, that I have no more sympathy than our friend has with those statutes which he has referred to respecting the Bible, and anything a man may say about it, because I believe truth is able to stand upon its own foundation ; and, there¬ fore, if that is the cause of his disapproval of the Bible, he may just as well not mention it, because the great majority of thinking men in the present day sympathize with him in that respect. It is, of course, of no use to bring a stale objection of this kind against the book. We have heard a great many objections raised to the Bible, or rather to the character of God as represented in the Bible, but I think they all resolve themselves into one or two heads—those which appear to make God the author, or the abettor of sin on the one hand; those which give such representa¬ tions of God as if he were merely a tutelar, local Deity, instead of the infinite, the all-wise, and the everlasting God; and those which have reference to his punitive-dealings with the children of men upon earth. I do not know whether in fifteen minutes I shall be able to touch on all these points. I will do my best to note those of them which I deem most important. Before I do so, let me say, if the five propositions with which I closed my speech had been duly attended to—if my opponent had either given them a direct denial, and shown reason for disapproving of them, or had approved of them, then wc should have been able to have done one of two things, either to have gone to a fair fight</page><page sequence="24">20 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. about the truth of those propositions, as containing the principles of interpretation of the Bible, upon which we are to judge of the ease, as a whole, or else our discussion would have come to an end, because there would have been no difference between us. With regard to the statement of the Fall, and his inferences respecting that, I do not feel inclined to touch upon them, because on the third night of this debate the whole question of moral evil will come before us. If, therefore, he will permit me to do so, I pass by that portion of the speech to-night, because it has reference to the popular account of the introduction, or, if not the introduc¬ tion, to the working of evil in this world, and that will bo a point more proper for the third evening's discussion. We come then at once, on the supposition that this is not disapproved of, to the case of the deluge. There we have a representation of a very solemn and important event. But the whole statement of the Word of God concerning that event, as far as it affects his moral character, or any attribute of his nature, is this,—that it was on account of the transgression of man against, both the law of his own nature and the law given to him by God, at that time in a traditional form, that this visitation fell upon the race of mankind as they then were. Now so far from my seeing in this that which is altogether and only repulsive to the Divine character, I see elements of goodness as well as justice in it. If the God of the Bible be a just God, he is bound to take some notice of the sins of men, and to punish them for their sins, provided remedial measures which have been previously adopted arc of no use. If you go to the Now Testament, you will find that for 120 years pre¬ viously to that catastrophe, the righteousness of God had been preached to men, and they had sot their face against that declara¬ tion; they had despised all the means God had given them of personal and collective improvement, and were an ungrateful race; and I say, if there bo any truth at all in the punitive justice of God, it wer e better to cut them off than allow them to multiply as they did. My opponent raised an objection to the details of this account of the deluge. His objection, however, arises out of this fact—he does not admit that there arc figurative representa¬ tions of the character of God in the Bible side by side with those abstract statements of his nature, which more properly describe what he is, and what ho is to men. Now, I say, calling him back to that proposition, we must have a decisive expression of opinion upon that point. Are there or are there not figurative representa¬ tions of the Deity of the Bible in the Bible Are there or are</page><page sequence="25">FIRST EVENING. 21 there not I repeat the question. If there are not, then a great deal that has been presented to you to-night as good logic is logic; if there are, it is sophistry and not logic. Because, if figurative descriptions of the character of God are consistent at all with higher and more profound representations of his real nature, then I hold that nine-tenths of the objections raised against the account of the deluge and its details, and the account of Abraham under the oaks of Mamre, resolve themselves into this one principle, that in the Bible you have figurative representations of God in order to assist the mind of man, who perceives most things through his senses, and through the senses carries them up to the more reflective acts of his mind; so that these figurative representations of God assist him in coming to the knowledge of things relating to him which he otherwise could not know. Now, that this is irrational I cannot conceive, when I think that all nations, whether they have had a divine revelation or not, have, by the common consent of human reason, agreed to represent the Deity by natural objects, and by things also pertaining to themselves, so as to make His Being more comprehensible and intelligible to them. But if you compare the figurative repre¬ sentations of the God of the Bible with those which you have in heathen mythology'—the Hindoo mythology, more especially, I refer to now—you will see that the Bible descriptions of God, figurative as they are, are highly rational and thoroughly consis¬ tent with man's notions of what should be an aid to his intellect through the medium of his senses. What can we conceive of as better representing the power of God than the human hand What can we conceive of as better than that The hand of the Lord is said to be strong, and mighty, and powerful. And what can we conceive of better than the human eye, as representing the divine omniscience—the eyes of the Lord running to and fro in the whole earth All I contend for is this. One half of the speeches we have heard to-night might have been dispensed with if that rule had been attended to and acknowledged. Now, this will apply to the case of God " coming down." I say, that as far as ab¬ stract Deity was concerned, there is no such representation as God coming down to Abraham, but we read of the angel of the Lord coming down. As to who He was, is another question, and also what were the reasons why God revealed himself under the old economy in this way, thus bringing himself down to our capacities, so that we may be able to understand more about him by this means than we could do otherwise. The angel of the Lord came down to</page><page sequence="26">22 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. Abraham, And then, when we speak of God going down to see, according to a fair interpretation of figurative language, we understand that the whole tiling was to be fairly investigated before anything was done. So far as this goes it is an element of pure justice. Who would condemn a race unheard Who would judge without knowing the whole of the matter And though God undoubtedly knew, and must know, according to the real essence of his being, what was going on, yet, to show to man, and make man understand that he would do nothing until the whole thing had been fairly investigated, ho deigns to represent him¬ self as going down to see what was being done. If a man take exception to this mode of reasoning, he must take exception to all human language—he must take exception to his own every¬ day conversation; to everything he himself has ever written. We come to the hardening of Pharaoh's heart, Now, we have always this objection brought against the Bible; but we never hear from the infidel the quotation of those passages in which Pharaoh, on the one hand, is said to have hardened his own heart, and the whole of the Egyptian people, on the other hand, to have hardened their hearts against the God of Israel. Now, the two statements are in the same book, and the book must either bc^thrown away altogether, or the oue statement be taken as well as the other. We must not take the one and not the other, but both; and by comparing them together, we shall see, and also understand, how it was possible, ay, how it was consistent, that God should permit the hardening of Pharaoh's heart, while Pharaoh may have been the chief means of that hardening. I find not only that case, but several others of the same order, and all resolve themselves into the same rule. I will give an illustration of what I believe to bo the true state of the matter. Take, for instance, a father who has two sons. It is undoubtedly right, and the duty of that father not only to educate his sons, but to discipline their character; and discipline, as far as it is effective, will not resolve itself into tho mere consideration of the father's motives, but the consideration of the character and disposition of the sons. With the purest of motives the father may discipline the two, and in the one case only harden, while in the other case he improves. The harden¬ ing process must necessarily resolve itself into the condition and character of the material, and not into the process brought to bear upon it. Then we are told further, that God says, in the Book of Isaiah, that he makes evil. Now, Mr. Bradlaugh must know, without going to anything but the English version of</page><page sequence="27">FIRST EVENING. 23 Scripture, that the word " evil" signifies calamity as often as it signifies moral evil; and if you take the context of that passage, the 4oth of Isaiah, you will find from the context that the evil there spoken of is not moral evil, but the calamity growing out of moral evil; and that it was in his character as a righteous and just God that he traces the judgments following upon moral evil to his own will, and to his own righteous distinction of the wrong from the right. God visited this nation—Babylon is referred to there; he visited this nation with their various calamities, because they had set his laws at defiance, and his prerogative as universal ruler. There¬ fore to tell us that God created evil militates in no degree what¬ soever against our view of the Scriptural character of God as a holy and righteous God. To suppose that God could not make a being capable of sin is a fallacy ; to suppose he could make one not capable of sinning is equally a fallacy. The fact is, universal perfection—perfection in all the attributes of being—can never pertain to created things at all—neither to angels nor to men. Absolute perfection and holiness belong only to God himself. So that the finite, having bounds to it, must be both capable of im¬ provement and deterioration, or else capable of neither. On that ground, therefore, we justify the ways of God to men, in giving them a law suitable to guide and direct their actions, and making them free, moral, voluntary beings, responsible to him for their actions afterwards. Then an effect has been attempted to be produced on your minds by a recital of the circumstances connected with the destruction of the first-born of Egypt, as if this were contrary to the character of God; but we have not been told that both the king himself and all the people had for a long time previously oppressed and down-trodden the Israelites, making them their slaves, and so forth. We have not been told, nor is it attempted to be shown, that the reason of that curse in Egypt was, that it was a visitation upon the nation for then: sins! We maintain that God did not visit the sin upon the people alone, or the king alone, but he visited upon king and people together their own sins, in their respective spheres. The children of Egypt were as guilty, as far as they had set at nought the decrees of the God of heaven, as their king had been. The Umpire here called " Time." Iconoclast.—My friend has dealt with three of the instances I put before you. He has desired my special attention to one of</page><page sequence="28">24 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. his propositions, and ho has put before us a conclusion which I suppose was intended to be logical. I will endeavour to take them all fairly, but before doing so I will point out to him that if he quotes Scripture it is necessary to be correct. First, I am not aware where in the Now Testament it says that God warned the inhabitants of the world 120 years before he destroyed them. I do not say it is not there, but I will be obliged by my friend's quoting it for me. Next, I do not know where in the 18th chapter of Genesis it says that it was the angel of the Lord who waited on Abraham. I do not say it is not there, but I shall bo obliged by my friend's finding it for me. Passing these two little matters, I will then ask my friend, supposing in the case of Pharaoh I accept his explanation that Pharaoh hardened his heart, am I to disbelieve that it was God who did it There are the two statements. On the one hand my friend says Pharaoh did it; on the other hand I say that God did it. We both can substantiate our statements from the Bible. Is it to be taken that the one neutralizes the other—that the one corrects the other—or that both are true? If both are true, then my objection equally applies to the act of hardening Pharaoh's heart committed by God. Now we will take the matters in the order our friend gave them. Before going into them he said, that if I had paid attention to one of his propositions it would have rendered part of the objections entirely unnecessary. The question was, whether I admitted that there were figurative as well as literal representa¬ tions of the Deity contained in the Bible All books have figures of speech in them, but this book, which claims to be a revelation not from a fallible authorit}-, but from an unerring God to man, should not have figures of speech in it so like literal narratives as to be liable to be mistaken for them. And there¬ fore I will ask my friend how I am to judge what is literal and what is figurative Am I to judge it by his convenience Well, every statement which seems to him to be irrational has to be turned into figurative; if that is so, then I shall know what course we are to pursue during the remainder of the discussion. Let us take the deluge. He says it was an act of justice—to whom The beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, the creeping things of the earth—was it just to them to kill them I say no. There is no offence charged against them. It is not argued that they were wicked; and where our friend says it would be right in the all-just God to mercilessly destroy, I say</page><page sequence="29">FIRST EVENING. 25 that it would be rational in the all-merciful God to cure the ill which he himself had produced, and remedy the crime which he himself had caused. Well, but our friend says, God does not make moral evil; and he says that the text quoted in Isaiah does not bear any such intei- pretation. I think it does, and I will read it. Our friend was kind enough to deal roundly with them. I will read the writings themselves to you, and see what interpretation they will bear. " I am the Lord, and there is none else. There is no God beside me. I created thee, though thou hast not known me, that they may know, from the rising of the sun to the west, that there is none beside me. I am the Lord, and there is none else. I form the light, and create darkness. I make peace, and create evil. I, the Lord, do all these things." He says, further down—" I have made the earth, and created man upon it. I have raised him up, and will direct him in all his ways." I ask, then, can I have any stronger text, or is this figurative Does it mean just the oppo¬ site to what it says? Instead of meaning that the Lord will direct man in all his ways, does it mean that men are free and independent, and that God does not direct at all Thus our friend's translation of figurative will mean this—everything that is unfortunate is figurative, and the proper explanation of it is that which makes it consistent with my preconceived notions of what Deity ought to be. Passing from the story of the deluge for a moment, let us take the story of Abraham. Our friend says it was the angel of the Lord who appeared to Abraham; but, if so, it would be only one difficulty more, because there would be the same difficulties per¬ taining to the apparition of the angel of the Lord as to the Lord; and our friend can only shield himself by saying that this is a discussion of the representation Lord, and not of the angel of the Lord. Let us see what the text says : " And the Lord appeared unto him in the plain of Mamre, and the Lord said unto Abraham"—"And the Lord said" —"And Abraham said, Let not the Lord be angry"—" And the Lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with Abraham." Our friend says it was not the Lord, but the angel of the Lord. Whore does he get "the angel of the Lord" from? Out of his fertile imagination, which knows that text is weak, and which introduces a phrase to defend that which, on the face of it, is irrational. Perhaps he will tell me that there is " angel" at the head of this chapter, and I know that the translators found the same difficulty which he is trying c</page><page sequence="30">26 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. to remedy, and put "the angel" there. Now, having dealt with the angel, let us deal with the Lord. What does the text say Our friend says it does not mean that God did not know—of course he knew, before he came down. Of course—ho was already down. But (says our friend) it expresses of Jehovah that he intended to do justice, and had a fair investigation before passing sentence and coming to judgment. I will show you that it don't mean anything of the kind, by the most wide construction you may give. Lot us read the text, and see what it hears out: " The Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I shall do for I know him," and so on; '•' because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous, I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is coming unto me, and if not I will know." Now, our friend says that when God said, "I will go down and see whether they have done according to the cry, and if not I will know," he did not mean what he said, but meant precisely oppo¬ site ; that it meant that God already know, but that he intended to go through the form of investigation, which was really unne¬ cessary, before he determined what sentence he might give, when he had already pre-doomed it from the foundation of the world. But I will go a stop further. The chapter puts the figurative explanation, fortunately, beyond possibility of doubt. Abraham was more merciful than God, and wanted the city to be spared, and he said, " If poradventure there bo fifty righteous within the city, wilt thou destroy these also?" and the Lord answered, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the city for their sakes." Now one of two things is certain: either God knew whether he would find fifty, or ho did not. If he did, then he was deceiving Abraham in promising that he •would spare it if fifty were in it, because ho knew there was not, and his promise to spare it was a sham. If ho did not know, he is not omniscient, and no figurative explanation can take the text away. I pass to the next illustration taken by my friend—the caso of Pharaoh. He says, first, that I ought to have told you that which I did not tell you, that in addition to God's hardening Pharaoh's heart, Pharaoh hardened his own heart. But, pardon me, I am discussing the character of God, not of Pharaoh. We are dis¬ cussing whether the representations of Deity in the Bible are irrational or derogatory. When I come to discuss Pharaoh's character, that will be something; but I positively state that the</page><page sequence="31">FIEST EVENING. 27 context tells you, taking the different chapters and verses in which you may find it—Exodus iv. 21; vii. 3; ix. 12; x. 1, 20,27; xi. 10; xiv. 4—I say, we have here distinct repetitions of the statement that God hardened Pharaoh's heart; and we are told that he did it that he might make his glory known and his name known. Now I ask you, in the face of that, how you can imagine Pharaoh hardening his own heart, when God had done it Our friend says it is not so much the process applied to the materials as the materials themselves; but God had made the materials. Pharaoh did not make himself. God surrounded him with the conditions which made him what ho was. "I the Lord create all things." Our friend seems to disbelieve that God directs man m all his ways. He seems to think that man directs his own ways in the sight of God. I am not here to discuss that; at present I leave it where it is. I pass now to that portion of our friend's speech, which I suppose was intended to convey some sort of question capable of logical solution. He says that it is impossible for God to make man incapable of doing wrong. Will he be kind enough to tell me how he knows that ?—because I don't. Ho says so; but his saying so is not argument. His illustration was certainty false. He says, "Because everything that is finite is capable of improve¬ ment or deterioration." Oh! But in what respect? I can imagine a given existence, finite on extension, but infinite in duration; and I want to know how the duration of that could be either improved or deteriorated. And, again, I want to know what my friend means by improvement and deterioration. Let us see. An infinite God makes finite men. According to his theory, infinite God is infinite good. There is no evil. Then the result of infinite good can be nothing but good, if the possibility of evil is excluded, however finite the creature may be. If man, the effect, be evil, or capable of evil, then God, the cause, of which man is the effect, must be evil or capable of evil also, because it is impossible to suppose evil emanating from a perfect God. If my friend tells me God is the cause, finite man the effect, and that this evil which God did not do, would not do, and had not intended to be done, results from man,-—then he makes man more powerful than God—the creature more potent than the Creator. If he says that God intended it, then the whole question is at an end at once, because that which is willed by the Omnipotent is fulfilled in the willing of it, and it is impossible that it should be otherwise than what it is. C 2</page><page sequence="32">28 MODEEN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. Having noticed these instances, I pass on then to refer to one or two others. Our friend may say they are figurative also. I read, in Exodus xxxi. 17, "In six days the Lord made heaven and earth; on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed." What is meant by the Deity resting, and being refreshed Can Deity rest? Can Deity be refreshed Figurative or not, what does m}r friend understand by that phrase Whether literal or figurative, what do you mean by it? Again, however you say this may be inter¬ preted, put it side by side with the 18th chapter of Genesis, in which the Lord ate part of the calf, " tender and good." Was the eating figurative or literal If the eating was figurative or literal, was the calf figurative or literal Was its tenderness figurative or literal How can I abide by this If my friend tells me that the whole of this book is a reflex of the wonderings, a mythological representation, the outgrowth of an ignorant and barbarous age, then I will concede it to him, and make no further attack upon it; hut while— The Umpire here interrupted the speaker by calling " Time," and Iconoclast immediately sat down. Me. Baekee :—I shall be very happy if I have all tho propo¬ sitions dealt with as they require, namely, by fair reasoning, and not by captious and garbled quotations from different parts of the Word of God. I say garbled, because we have had only the parts, and not the whole of the passages. With regard to the question, how you can reconcile the destruction of the fowls and animals, etc., in the deluge, with God's justice, I simply say that it is a case which has nothing whatever to do with Divine justice —nothing whatever. These creatures were the creatures of God. He made them, and he had a right to dispose of them as he thought fit. Towards responsible creatures, not free agents, as men are, there can be no such thing as justice or injustice. It is simply a case in which there is the exercise of absolute right of control: the disposal of certain creatures on the part of a Being who made them, who lets them live as long as he pleases, and then puts them afterwards to death as he pleases. You cannot make a case of injustice out of it, whatever else you may do. Then, again, you may remember, that so far as it was possible for mercy and goodness to bo exhibited to the animal creation, it was done; for there was provision made for the preservation of the various species, notwithstanding the wreck caused by the deluge. We are told, again, that there is nothing about the angel of the</page><page sequence="33">[ FIRST EVENING. 29 Lord in the 18th chapter of Genesis. Well, perhaps that is literally true; but it only serves to illustrate one of my propo¬ sitions—-a truth which my opponent has not ventured to touch— namely, that the character of God is not to be discovered from any one passage, but from such a collection of passages as the book will afford. You will find, therefore, if you trace those appearances of God under patriarchal times spoken of in the Seiiptures, that the person who appeared to Abraham on that occasion was the angel of the Lord. He is called so in the 3rd chapter of Exodus, and he is called so in other places in the Old Testament, but in that especially. In the beginning of ths chapter there are said to be three men that came there, clearly showing that if God was there it was only in some accommodative sense — that is to say, he was there as the vast, invisible, and incomprehensible Deity, but there impersonated and embodied in one of the throe individuals; and if you take that view, all that absurd reference to eating and not eating passes away altogether, and has no relation to the subject. It was the human form—be it what it might, come whence it might, and go where it might—that partook of the repast Abraham had provided. The calf was a real calf; and there are more calves than one; the eating was real eating, and that is about all which some can do. Now, \\ itli regard to the case of Noah; Mr. Bradlaugh wants to be referred to the passage in the New Testament which speaks of the religious privileges of the antediluvians as extending over 120 years. Well, in no one verse or text of the New Testament will you find all that; but I am in the habit of bringing the Old and New Testaments together, and looking at the two together, when I want to know the whole truth of any matter. 1 find in the 6th of Genesis that God, after he had declared his determina¬ tion to destroy the people of that day, gave them 120 years' respite, and that during that time Noah was preparing his ark; and I find in the Epistles of Peter, that, while the ark was pre¬ paring, Noah was a preacher of righteousness to the men of his generation. I get, then, by the clearest deduction, by the most infallible process of reasoning, the fact—though not in any one solitary verse of Scripture—that for one hundred and twenty years warnings, preaching, and exhortations to improvement were given to men, as moral and responsible agents, before the deluge swept them away. Then, again, we are told that God deceived Abraham if he knew there were not fifty righteous persons in the city of Sodom. Now</page><page sequence="34">30 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. I cannot understand by what process of reasoning any man can come to that conclusion. I cannot, indeed. God knew it, but Abraham did not. It was a fair opportunity for the sympathies and feelings of Abraham to come out in regard to such a spectacle as that which is presented before you. And how the simple fact of Abraham's not knowing that there were fifty righteous men in the city can show that God was deceiving him, I cannot tell; and, till I am told in something like a definite proposition, I really cannot answer it. I want to see how it could be proved that God is a deceiver by the simple fact of his withholding any statement whatever from Abraham, beyond the simple brief statement that he was come down to investigate the case, and that, if it were wrong, to cast men aside as a just reward of their sin. I want to be informed on that point, at any rate. Then ho says that he can conceive of God making a creature that is perfect. Well, it is a conception at present, but not a fact; nor can it be a fact, as I shall endeavour to show in a very few words just now. He says that a being need not necessarily be capable of deterioration, because capable of improvement. Well, I don't know how that is arrived at as a fair conclusion. To my mind, it seems an utter impossibility that it should be otherwise. If I am capable of growing an inch taller, it follows that I was once an inch shorter, or else there is no truth in growth. If I can become wiser, it follows that I was once less wise, or else it were impossible for mo to improve. Now, with God, wisdom and know¬ ledge are perfect; but the wisdom and knowledge of man are capable of growth and development; and it is because it is so that God has dealt with mo as he has, both in the representations of himself in the Scripture and the unfoldings of himself to men, from step to step, and stage to stage, in the history of the world. But I can see clearly what my friend is aiming at, namely, to show that the representations of such cases as the deluge and the hardening of Pharaoh's heart, and so forth, are utterly inconsistent with what we believe to be the moral attributes of the Divine character. Ho says, for instance, that it is inconsistent to repre¬ sent God as permitting calamity and moral evil. Now listen to one or two things. With regard to animals and infants, who are part of the great system, but who are unconscious, and therefore irresponsible, I hold that for God to act unjustly towards them is impossible. With regard to storms, fires, and so forth, which are natural agencies, we see evils and calamities arising out of them, but that</page><page sequence="35">FIEST EVENING. 31 does not destroy my friend's belief in nature. Nor would the simple existence of a storm to clear the atmosphere to-night cause my friend to suppose that the atmosphere is not a good thing for man to breathe ; nor would any darkness which might eclipse the sun for a couple of hours, or for part of an hour, show to him or cause him to think that the light of the sun was not good. So you will find throughout all the order and arrangements of the universe, as well as in the conduct of God, that evil is, of necessity, not merely the converse, but the negative of the good. It is so by necessity, and I cannot see how man can have a distinct and positive idea of good without the converse idea of evil to assist in the forming of this conception. Whatever process of reason this statement may lead to on his part, I care not, because I am quite prepared for the results that will follow. As to what must characterize the dealings of a wise and holy God with responsible beings like men, I would make the following assertions, which my friend may deal with as he pleases. That virtue is the foundation of happiness; that freedom of moral action—not of physical, for with the former I am chiefly to deal —is essential to virtue. You cannot have virtue without perfect freedom of action. Most virtue, therefore, will be necessarily developed where there is the greatest liberty. But there is the greatest liberty where there is the greatest opportunity of evil as well as good. My opponent, then, is bound to show how sin could have been prevented under any system of moral govern¬ ment more effectually than it may be prevented under the present system of moral government, when the various purposes and plans of that moral government are brought to bear. As a moral governor, God is not in a position to require more than two things of man—the one is the right and prerogative to command, and tho other is to discountenance vice and to reward virtue. This is the simple attitude of God as a moi'al ruler towards evil, and you can make no more of it, do what you will. There are only two ways of discouraging vice and promoting virtue—either by moral suasion, that is, the presentation of sufficient motives to deter from the one and induce the other ; and this is the way that God most generally appoints, the simple maimer which, from the beginning until now, he has adopted. Every promise made to virtue, and every threatening made to vice, is a part of that process. In the promises to lead man into a virtuous condition, the character of God stands out illustriously in Scripture; for while God is not required, in his character as a moral governor, to do</page><page sequence="36">32 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. more than command virtue and forbid vice, yet in his character as the Saviour of mankind he has come nearer to man, and brought to him those influences which will assist him to be virtuous, and thus to enjoy the favour of his God. While God, as a moral governor, has not done that, the other aspects of his character, given in the Bible, represent him as doing it. I take the one as well as the other part of G od's character, which I could not possibly do if I were to quibble at single statements of Scripture, as I think my friend has to-night. After all, he says, how could God co-operate with men in their spiritual actions He says, God made the criminal. I say, No! God made the creature that committed the crime, but not the criminal. He says, God upheld and sustained Pharaoh while he committed sin, and that therefore the sin was God's sin. If ho means that it was the power of God which kept Pharaoh's arm strong, well and good—that is a more physical act. If he means that God sustained his intellectual faculties, well and good. We know that God sustains every one's. But the direction of these faculties is in accordance with the choice and purpose of a person's own mind, or else there is neither viee nor virtue in it, and therefore you can neither make good nor evil out of it. You cannot prevent an act of sin except in one of two ways : either by moral suasion—and that is the great means which God adopts in the accomplishment of his purpose—or, as some think, but in vain, by physical force. Take a lion, for instance, out of a forest, and shut him up in a pit or den; he is rendered harmless by the cage that encloses him; but the nature of the lion is there still— no restraint that you can put upon him will make him other than a lion. Iconoclast :—My friend charges mo with quibbling with texts of Scripture. At least, I have read texts which he has not done. He says that he reads in tho Old and New Testaments that which justifies him in saying that tho New Testament teaches that God warned the people for 120 years. I tell him that ho reads it neither in the Old nor in the New, and that he will no¬ where read that during the time of tho preparation of the ark Noah occupied himself in preaching to the people, because it is not in the Bible, from one end of it to the other. And if Genesis be true, Noah could not have done it, because Noah was charged to build the ark and to do certain things with the animals ; but he was not charged one word about preaching, and we are expressly told that Noah did as the Lord commanded him. In the only</page><page sequence="37">FIRST EVENING. 33 text of the Bible I am aware of which says Noah was a preacher of righteousness, it does not say that he preached one word in the interval between the warning to Noah and the deluge coming on. I put it, therefore, that our friend has misapplied texts with the ability of knowing it as v&gt; ell as I; and that, when his attention was drawn to it, ho ought candidly to have acknowledged the error. Next he says, " Perhaps the angel of the Lord is not mentioned in the 18th of Genesis." There is no " perhaps." You know it is not; and when you charge me with garbling texts, and with false logic and quotations, and are "nitty upon calves, you must remem¬ ber that there are other animals than calves that have seen angels invisible to others. Our friend saj s that I put it to you that I could conceive of God making a perfect man. I never said anything of the kind. I said that I could not conceive of it; but that it was for him to explain what he meant by saying that God could not make a man who could not be capable of committing sin. He said that. He also said that I told you that I could not concehc but that a finite being might bo capable of improvement without being capable of deterioration. I did not say that. I said that I eould conceive a given being finite on extension but infinite in duration, and I could not conceive how my friend's illustration would apply to such a case as that; and I asked him to explain it. My friend having carefully prepared a speech which he was determined the public should have the benefit of, forgot to explain how it was that evil could emanate from infinite good at all; andvihilehe tells me that I had better attend to his proposition—while ho tells you, dealing I suppose with the persons befoio him, that there are some people moie fit for eating than for anj thing else— ho does not see fit to digest tho proposition put before him in a proper manner. As long as my friend kept clear of sharp words I kept clear of them, too ; I have now done with them, and for the other five evenings I have done v\ ith them so long as he has. But I wear a sword; and when my friend uses his, 1 v ill parry and point in return. Now our friend has been kind enough to tell us that in the case of God and Abraham it was the three men that appeared; and either the whole or one of them that ate the calf, not God. Why cannot God eat Literally or figuratively—can he or can he not What were the three men Were they God or not If they were not God, then how can you separate and distinguish c 3</page><page sequence="38">34 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. them But if they were God, then your whole argument was a fraud, and a delusion upon your auditors. But our friend says he can see no deception in God's dealings with Abraham. No deception Let us investigate it. What is it He says, "I am about to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah;" and Abraham says, " If there be fifty good men, will you spare the city?" God says, "Yes;" but if Abraham had been satisfied, and there were only forty-nine, it would be a deception upon Abraham, who wished tho prerogative of mere}' to bo exercised, and God would have tricked him by one man. Our friend hisses; but I will prove, from the Bible, to you that God was capable of such trickery. I will illustrate to you a case in which, it being impossible to persuade a man to come to his destruc¬ tion by true means, God caused lying spirits to go out to tempt him and lead him into error. Our friend's figurative argument counts for very little. He has forgotten how much of this is figurative and how much not. When pressed upon the subject, it is inconvenient to deal with it. It is very comfortable to talk round things, but unpleasant when you come to apply the text to see how much is figurative and how much not. You say that you cannot do injustice to animals. Can you not be cruel and merci¬ less to them Was it cruel and merciless to inflict death upon animals without reasonable cause Even under the English law it is penal to destroy animals under certain circumstances.—[Mr. Barker :—No comparison at all.]—Our friend says this is no comparison at all. I can well imagine Christians may think it no comparison at all, for they dare not judge the actions of God by those of men. Why, the standard of humanity rises so high above the standard of religion contained in this book, that our better nature revolts and rebels against the latter. How many more illustrations shall we take How many have been dealt with by my opponent out of those I have laid before you The case of Jacob and Esau—how has my opponent en¬ countered that He spoke of God's firmness. How has he told me it is exemplified in that case How has he dealt with the question of moral evil in Isaiah He ch arged me with mis¬ quoting, and told you that tho context would explain it. It was I who dared him to read tho context, and he who gave us a mass of written matter having nothing to do with it. I submit that the onus lies with him, and that it was for him to prove that the representations of Deity were neither derogatory nor irrational. He has talked of God invisible. He must surely have forgotten</page><page sequence="39">FIRST EVENING. 35 the seventy-three persons who went up somewhere—I don't know where—to see God, who saw him sitting on something,—I don't know what,—and under his feet a sapphire stone. Our friend says that is figurative, that it does not mean what it says. It knocks to pieces his whole theory of what God should be. At any rate, our friend should have done something more than charge me with misquoting. My friend says I have garbled, and what is his illustration? I have taken especial instances of that of which there can be no mistake. I have read texts of Scripture, and challenged him to do the like. He has refused, and in each case where he has read a text he has failed in its proper application. He says, that although the " angel of the Lord " is not mentioned in Genesis, it is mentioned in Exodus. Now, mark the argument. He says, that according to the context, it was the angel of the Lord that appeared to Abraham. When told that it was " the Lord," and not " the angel of the Lord," he says, "Turn to the 3rd of Exodus, and there you will find it explained." I tell you that in Exodus iii. there is not a word about the interview with Abraham at all, and that he has fastened upon a phrase which has no connection with the argument, for the purpose of bolstering up a position he has been driven from. Are the repre¬ sentations of the Deity contained in the Bible irrational or derogatory To-night you are only to judge by the represen¬ tations spoken of by my friend and myself. What has he shown of God's love, mercy, truth, omnipotence, in the Bible I have shown him as weak, as local, as grieving, as repenting, as dining off dressed calf, tender and good; and our friend can only say that there are a number of calves, as probably he is better acquainted with that class than I. I now ask you to do better justice to the subject than either my friend or I have done. In one night it is impossible fairly to try this question. I admit I am only an advocate. I make no pretence to impartiality; I only strive to do such as I can with my own case, conserving only this, that I strive to be honest in the plan I ha\e in view, namely, to draw tho human mind from fetters that batten it down, to enlarge human intellect, and to break away those restrictions which make me an outlaw in society. Our friend tells you that I have made a clap-trap matter in putting it to you that there are state restrictions in favour of this book. Surely not! Every restriction that I find, it is for me to deal with. Why am I here to-night, knowing it no shame to toll you frankly and honestly that I am an Atheist</page><page sequence="40">36 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. I tell you why. Because at present men who are infidels or atheists are tabooed—are liable to bo deprived of their social rights and debarred from their social duties; and it is my duty to impeach this Bible which is taught to them in schools, before they have time to think, which is preached to them by men who are not sufficiently versed in its texts to be able to defend them when they come here. It is my duty to deal with it as I do, that the generation coming after us, guided by science instead of swaddled in Bible leaves, will bo able to give free scope to their intellect, their energy, and their aspirations, and to pluck the fruit of the tree which the church teaches that God cursed man for plucking,— the tree of knowledge, of which, if a man eat, his eyes shall be opened, and he shall know good from evil, and be able to check the growth of the vice of a bygone age, which fastened itself upon the credulity of man, and dared to excommunicato and damn those- who rose up against it, The Umpire :—The Secretary has now an announcement to make. Me. Whitmoee :—The announcement I have to make is that the joint committee find themselves in a difficulty. We have said, and we wish to do it, that we will give tho whole of the proceeds of this discussion, after deducting expenses, to the fund for relieving distress in the cotton districts; but we wish also to publish a verbatim report of the discussion. Iconoclast :—I object to this. I am no party to the wish to publish the debate. I want the whole proceeds to go to the Lancashire Fund. No such statement should have been made without its being mentioned to mo. The Umpire :—I must rule that the matter cannot come before Iconoclast then moved, and the Rev. W. Barker seconded, a vote of thanks to the Chan-men and the Umpire, which was carried by acclamation, and briefly acknowledged. The proceedings then terminated.</page><page sequence="41">SECOND NIGHT'S DISCUSSION. FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 1862. Subject:—Is Secularism, which inculcates the practical sufficiency of morality, independent of Biblical religion, calculated to lead to the highest development of the physical, moral, and intellectual nature of man The Chairmen and the Umpire were the same as on the preceding evening. The Umpire read the subject announced for debate, and, having entreated a silent hearing for both disputants, called upon Iconoclast to open the discussion. Iconoclast :—Friends, I should have regretted, I am quite sure with every other person present, had you, sir, unfortunately not been present this evening, because, from the impartial and kindly manner in -\\ hich you on Tuesday evening acted towards both dis¬ putants, I am sure the audience would concur with me in deploring your absence as a loss during the continuance of this debate. Tho subject for discussion this evening, and which it is my duty to open, involves, it seems to me, questions of the highest import— questions upon which it is desirable that we should come to a perfect understanding. And in addiessing you, numerous as you are, permit me to say that this evening, in affirming my own position, and in assailing that of my opponent, I stand here to fulfil a duty as well as to exercise a right; and in endorsing tho request of tho Umpire, that you will abstain from signs of appro¬ bation or disapprobation until the close of the speeches, I do it for my own convenience as well as for yours. You will the better hear what I say as well as the reply to me, and we shall all be the better able to judge of the weight of tho arguments on either side.</page><page sequence="42">38 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. And to my friend who opposes me, I appeal as well as to you. I ask him, with me, during the continuance of this debate, to forget one another, and only to remember tho great subject we have in hand. Do not let us set the example to others of forgetting that we are not here to speak for ourselves alone, but that we are here advo¬ cates—weak it may be—on the one side and on the other of the great cause of truth, for which we both are striving. My question this evening is thus worded by those who have worded the questions for debate:—" Is secularism, which incul¬ cates the practical sufficiency of morality, independent of biblical religion, calculated to lead to the highest development of the physical, moral, and intellectual nature of man?" This propo¬ sition is, at the same time, a declaration and a question. It declares that secularism affirms the sufficiency of morality, inde¬ pendent of Biblical religion, and it is to this declaration that I wish to draw your attention first. I, as a secularist, affirm morality independent of the Bible; but what does that mean To affirm morality independent of tho Bible is to affirm morality in opposition to the Bible, because in this country the Bible claims the sway of education; or, at least, tho sway of all education is claimed by the teachers of the Bible. The Bible is made to per¬ meate in every book, in every school, in every phase of thought ; and I, as a secularist, to-night seek to impeach that, and seek to declare to you that secularism, which inculcates morality in opposition to the Bible, is sufficient for the highest development of man. There is not only a declaration but a question. It is asked, " Is this secularism calculated to lead to man's highest develop¬ ment ?" And it is upon that point that I and my friend will have to debate this evening. First, what is morality Morality, it seems to me, may be fairly expressed as the science of human duty; but even when we have said that, we are as far from an answer to tho question as we were before we put it at all, because, while we may all agree that morality is the science of human duty, we may disagree as to what that science is; we may disagree still more as to the meaning of every word we use in expressing it. Morality, in fact, is differently defined in different climes—in different phases of society in tho same clime; and it is therefore thoroughly necessary that we should understand this evening pre¬ cisely what we mean by morality and immorality. What act is moral I ask my friend to tell you what he considers to bo the standard of a moral act. I tell you now, that with me that act is</page><page sequence="43">SLCOND EVENING. 39 moral which results in the greatest good to the greatest number with the least injury to any ; which, in fact, involves the largest amount of individual well-being. It may be that my friend may be able to give you a better definition than that. I wait for it, and I shall be glad to hear it. But there is much to be considered in dealing even with the definition, because it may be, in dealing with the intent and with the act, that you may confound the intent and the act, and denounce, in denouncing the act, the actor, when the actor himself should not be denounced at all. All these phases will form the legitimate subject of inquiry this evening. Now, there are conflicting notions of morality, and I affirm morality independent of the Bible. Before pointing out how the Bible view of morality differs from mine, I will read to you a few words from a book which, while it does not express entirely my views on the subject, contains so much that is good, that, at the risk of having the whole of it fastened on me when I don't want it, I will toll you its title and its author. It is " Social and Political Morality," by William Lovett. I am obliged to say that, when I am quoting from a part of a book, I don't swallow it from the preface to the conclusion. I am compelled to say this, because I have been treated, in some respects, differently from other men; and sometimes, when I have incautiously opened the page of a book, and found some view of truth in it—for all books are like all men, not wholly bad or v holly good, but holding some portion of the truth—some more, some less—the great truth permeating amongst the whole, and to be gathered from the whole, and to be given to those •nho have the right to it, namely, the whole of human kind—I say I have sometimes had the whole contents of such a book fastened upon me. Here I have a definition by Mr. Lovett of what ho considers are the duties of men as citizens of a state; and it is necessary I should read it to you first, oecause so much of my speech will turn upon it that I vi ish to put you in possession of his definition. He says first:—• "Man has a personal right to the free exercise of his mental and bodily powers for his own benefit, to the extent of not injuiing himself or any other person; and with this right he has a duty, namely, to develop this in himself and in his offspring to the fullest possible extent." Now, the Bible don't permit him this either in himself or in his offspring. He cannot develop his mental powers to tho fullest,</page><page sequence="44">40 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. because the Bible puts, as the highest point of morality, faith. No more destructive teaching—destructive to all morality—can be put before peoples at all. Faith does not permit mental develop ment—faith destroys it. Men who are taught to say, " I believe'' —who are taught to abase their intellects upon the threshold of the unknown—men who are taught to receive a certain formula of words at the hands of one who may be even less than themselves capable of investigating the subject he preaches upon—these men are not only not developed as they might be, but the development is misdirected, and instead of becoming human beings, they become mere parrots, ready to receive a form of words, as though they were a suit of clothes furnished to them, not made by themselves, and fitting them or not as may happen. Secondly, Mr. Lovett says that " Man has a right to share in tho common bounties of nature—of the earth, the air, and the waters—to the extent and in the manner which may be found most advantageous to society." Now, this is directly in opposition to the Bible teaching. The Bible limits a man's condition—puts it that there should be poor, that there are rich, that tho Lord regulates the position of the rich and the poor; puts poverty as a blessing—as a state to be desired—makes poverty, misery, and suffering here a state which is the passport to reward and happiness here¬ after. Secularism teaches that this is not so—that this is wrong, and improper, aud immoral—that in poverty you have the fruitful source of all crime, all disease, all misery. And as secularism teaches that tho highest end of human life is the attainment of human happiness, it is obliged at once to join issue with and declare war against that doctrine which teaches that misery here will be recompensed by well-being hereafter. What secularism would put before you is this:—without teaching you whether or no, when you are dead, you may live, it teaches you to live well here—to live truly hero—to put out to the fullest your manhood here. You can never bo more than man—you can never be more than woman—but you may bo much less either than man or woman, when you are down on your knees praying for that which self-reliantly and independently you might work out and achieve for yourselves. Thirdly, Mr. Lovett says:— " Each man has a right to determine equally with every</page><page sequence="45">SECOND EVENING. 41 other man how his country shall be governed; by what laws his person and his property shall be protected." Here again secularist teaching would be directly at issue with the Bible. The Bible would say, "Fear God, and honour the king." " Render to Caasar the tilings that are Csesar's." " The powers that be are ordained by God." But find mo in the Bible, from the beginning to the end, " Render to the people the rights of the people." Yet are not peoples higher than kings Are not men higher than crowns? Is not humanity better than the sceptre I put it before you that the rights of man override all other rights; and that when human kind do their duties to one another, there will be no need for any other honour to the govern¬ ment than that honour which it obtains in working out the common happiness and common weal of the people by whom it is upheld, and whose will it expresses. In the Bible dealings with kings and peoples, you will find that in each case, or in nearly each case in which the king does the wrong, the misery following that wrong is inflicted upon the people. Tell me where in the Bible is there any table of human rights. Tell me vhere are your political positions cared for in the Bible. Nowhere. You may find me some one or two texts, but our friend gave you the right way of dealing with it, the other night, when he said you should judge the Bible as a whole. I am dealing with it as a whole. While you find the rights of kings and priests carefully protected, and the government of kings and priests in opposition to the people carefully upheld, you cannot find the people's rights—the most sacred of all, because the most universal—cared for or upheld at all. Next he says:— " That man has a right to hold and unmolestedly enjoy whatever property is necessary for the well-being of the community; hence a right to possess and enjoy whatever can be produced by the exercise of the mental or bodily faculties ; to exchange, receive, inherit, to give or will his property to others." I pass now to the question again, because I have laid before you from this book points which are directly at issue with all Bible teaching; because, while tho Bible draws its morality, if at all, from the doctrines of God, and the right of God to give laws to the people, the morality of secularism finds its origin in the common desire for human happiness—in the common desire of</page><page sequence="46">42 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. each man to live as happily as he can. Men have conflicting notions of how they can best attain happiness—conflicting practices in their ways to attain it. But all men desire to attain it, and what secularism would teach is, that the way to attain human happiness is by developing himself to the fullest. The Bible would say, " Watch and pray." The Bible would say, " Seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness, and all else shall bo added to you." But secularism would say, "Develop your manhood to the fullest—your physical manhood; understand the laws of your existence; devote your attention to those sequences in which pain and pleasure are the necessary results." In developing yourselves to the fullest extent, physically and mentally, you are also, not entirely, but to a great extent, de\ elop¬ ing yourselves morally also, and all you have to guard against is this—in the search for happiness you are not to look at it for yourself alone, but for all. The way to make yourself happy, the way to make yourself wise, is by giving happiness and wisdom to others. This is the best strife; this is the best work; this the work which secularism recommends to you. I may be asked what lule of right have you And I know that our fiiends are fond sometimes of quoting one rule of right which they tell mo they draw from the Bible—" Do unto otheis as ye would that others should do unto you." I affirm, first, that wo ha\e a higher rule of right than this. I affirm, secondly, that this is no rule of right at all. Our rule of right is this—" Do what is right, whether it is that which ye would that otheis should do unto you or no." How does this apply Let us see. Men ignorant may wish that others should do unto them that which is not for the common good—for the common weal. Educated men, men well trained, men conscious of the conditions of their existence, so far from doing to others as they would wish that others should do unto them, will do unto others that which is inculcated for the permanent good of human kind. And there is no standard defined, limited, fixed, w ailed in morality, which can be preached to you; and this is the objection to all religions, and the advantage of secularism. Religions always have a scale of morality fixed fiom a certain day; never elastic, never stretch¬ ing, never including new thoughts; while pure morality is like humanity, progressive; each day's knowledge, each day's truth draws in new phases of thought—new modes of action better calculated to promote the happiness of human kind than that of the day before.</page><page sequence="47">SECOND EVENING. 43 Now, I have put it to you that the rule of life urged by our friend—" Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you," is not sufficient. There is an old illustration of it that I have often given, which has not been answered, and which I will invite my friend to answer, if it is suscep¬ tible of it. Take the case of our friend. Imagine him to be in one of the border states of America. Put it that a slave is escaping from his master, and is running by the house which our friend dwells in. The slave says to him, " I am pursued, I am escaping from slavery. Slavery is an immoral, an inhuman state—a state which ought never to be permitted to exist—I pray you to protect me." Our friend, a Bible man, holding the sufficiency of Bible morality, says, " I cannot; slavery is a Bible institution ; slavery is permitted by the Bible; slavery is inculcated in the Old Testament, where it says, ' Both thy bond¬ men and bondmaids which thou shalt have shall be of the heathen that arc round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with j'ou, which they begat in your land; and they shall be your possession. And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall bo your bondmen for ever.'" My friend would apply that to the slave, and would say, " God has never repealed that, never given one word revoking it. I am a Bible Christian, and I can¬ not go against slavery." Then the slave -would say, " Oh! but if my master took me he would beat me to death." Our friend says still, " I believe in the Bible, and the Bible says that if your master smite you so that you die under his hand, he shall bo punished; but if he calculate, and beat you so that you dio in two or three days after, the Bible admits the master has a right to do it; you are his money, and I cannot take you in on that account." The slave says, " As you quote Scripture. I will give Scripture too. The Bible says, 'Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you.' Now, I am a slave, wanting to escape, and I want to bo protected. If you were in my position you would want to be protected too. Protect me." My friend, who is a good Biblo Christian, says, " That is good, I will protect you ;" and despising the contradiction between the one passage and the other, he sides with the slave, and protects him. Presently some more persons come along. They say, " Is the slave here " " Yes." " Give him up." Our friend says, " I will not; he quoted Scripture to me,</page><page sequence="48">44 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. and I took him in, and protected him." The slave pursuers say, " But Scripture is for us too. Slavery is a divine institution. The Lord has permitted it, and uphold it; and why should you stand in the way of it ?" But he says, " He quoted to me a verse from the New Testament, ' Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you;' and therefore I protected him, and I must." The slave pursuers say, " This slave is the property of a poor old bed-ridden woman—her only support; if she does not get him back she must starve. If you were a bed-ridden woman, and your only slave, your sole support, had run away, and left you in danger of starvation, you would like to got him back again. Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you, and give the woman back her slave." Why, if our friend has only his Bible to help him, where would he be I appeal to a rule of right, that he will not find from the beginning of Genesis to the end of Revelations—" I will do that which is right, humane, moral, just, whether it is that which I should wish my neighbour to do unto me or no." I leave this, because I have no doubt my friend will deal with it presently; and I now proceed to attack that principal feature put forward in Bible morality, which seems to me to deserve attack, and which contrasts most strongly with secular teaching in dealing with the question, " Will secularism lead to the highest develop¬ ment of the physical, moral, and intellectual nature of man?" The doctrine of our friend is, shun tho world, the flesh, and tho devil, and he enjoins a peculiar sort of asceticism, which consists in denying to ourselves what ho calls the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, as the highest kind of virtue. Now, what is virtue Not asceticism. Not going into a desert, or hiding your¬ selves in a coll, or climbing on to the top of some mountain or other. Not denying to yourselves your part in life, but taking part in its battles, taking part in its turmoil, taking part in its struggles, living out as manly as you can, meeting wrong where- ever you can, and driving it back. The doctrine of the Bible, on the contrary, is, " Resist not evil; if a man smite you on the one cheek, turn to him the other also." Secularism will teach you self-reliance, independence, dignity. It would teach you that self-reliance is the noblest diadem that ever man was crowned with; and that the man who walks with brow erect, with eye keen and bright, with arms nerved to defy the wrong, and brain well developed to detect the wrong and beat it back, is a far better man than he who goes down on his knees in some church or</page><page sequence="49">SECOND EVENING. 4o chapel, praying for God to remove that which he has not the courage to remove for himself. Seculaiism certainly teaches, with regard to the physical development of man, that which the Bible does not teach at all. Tell mo where, in the Bible, are the rule3 for the physical development of man, or for his moral and intel¬ lectual development. Shall I read to you the physical laws from the Old Testament You would tell me at once that they are out of date, and were given to a barbarous, ignorant, and uncivilized people, and that we have progressed beyond them. Where would you find them in the New Testament In the doctrine of self- mutilation, taught in the 19th chapter of Matthew, verso 12. In any of the doctrines of Jesus, tell me where you vill find any¬ thing for man's physical development at all, where for his moral, where for his intellectual, where for his poesy, where for the duty of life. It is not here. In the Old Testament you will find men frightened by the choice of one people, who, at the expense of all the other peoples in the world, are led to a pretended land flowing with milk and honey, through livers of blood and scenes of slaughter; and in the New Testament you will find men frightem d away from every high conception by fires of eternal torment, which, if real, would stamp the whole as demoniac, and which, despite even its unreality, frightens everybody away from it. I hardly know what reply my friend will make to it, or what course he will take in dealing vith the question, but I put it here frankly and plainly at once, that true morality can only be derived outside the Bible; that if you take the Bible as a guide, immorality must necessarily result; that secularism draws from everything, not from one ; from every age, not from one ; that it is not defined or done with to-day, but takes in every new fact of to-morrow; that wo have not one church or chapel, but in each mechanics' insti- tution, lecture-room, scientific hall, we have our church or chapel. i We have no priest; each man who finds a new thought and gives it to his fellow, is a priest to himself; and the only worship wo j delight in and uphold is that noblest woik of all—tho work of t upraising one another, and helping one another up. Tho only I temple we have is not a steeple-house, crowned with a lightning i conductor to protect it against the lightning of God himself, but f the mighty temple of fact and truth, built up from honest men's f brains, and vigorous men's thoughts. This is our temple. t Mr. Barker :—One tale is very good until another is told, as the old proverb saj s. Now I hope my friends will not attempt to</page><page sequence="50">46 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. give any expression of feeling while I am speaking, and I do hope they will not do so while Mr. Bradlaugh is speaking. Un¬ doubtedly he will say many things of which you will highly disapprove, and I as heartily disapprove of them as you do; but let us see whether, while you quietly listen, we cannot, in some¬ thing like an efficient manner, deal with these things. I came here this evening expecting that my friend would plead for and establish a system of secular morality independent of tho Biblo, and that he would show us how secularists were to inculcate that morality, or rather secure its adoption and practice amongst men —for that is part of our proposition. But he has not touched that part, or tried to show you how this said secular morality, which we have been told is so much better than Bible morality—after tho scheme has been defined, for it is not yet defined, it is only in process—how it is to be inculcated upon you, who are to be the subjects, probably, under the new secular riqimc. Now, we have been told this evening that secularism teaches certain things, and those things have been read to you from a book, concerning which the speaker carefully guarded himself by saying ho does not endorse all that is in the book. I am very glad to hear that from him, indeed, but I should like to ask one question—whether he thinks tho book, as a whole, contains the results of its own propo- sitional teaching If it does, then ho is necessitated, whether he will or not, to endorse the details as well as the propositions, and must endorse the whole book; and ho would not like to do that. But if the book is illogical, wiry bring it hero as far superior to anything wo could have to teach us morality and true human development We have been told that tho Bible contains no rules for physical morality. I say it does, and that it teaches you most clearly to subdue the desires and lusts of the flesh, which are con¬ trary to morality, and must bo, even according to a pure secu¬ larist theory of morality, opposed to the higher and better interests of the intellectual nature of man. Christianity teaches you by direct precept to control and regulate this lower nature by the dictates of your higher nature. But inasmuch as ho has said there is no passage in tho Biblo, it is quite enough if I return the assertion—there are numbers of passages of this kind in the Bible. He says Christianity docs not set its face against those social and moral evils which we have seen have afflicted humanity in various ages of tho world—such, for instance, as slavery and some other things which he has mentioned, which I think he will find it exceedingly difficult to show are taught in the Scriptures. I</page><page sequence="51">SECOND EVENING. 47 think he will find it difficult indeed to show that there is any direct teaching in the sense of enforcing or even recommending the things he has adverted to. In the 19 th chapter of Matthew, and the 12th verse, the Saviour was rather discussing a principle than laying down a rule of action for anybody; and so far from the Bible teaching, in fact, what he thinks is taught in that passage, ho will find in the book of Deuteronomy a passage of Scripture strongly condemnatory of every species of self-mutilation, and the penalty thereof was, for ten generations, to be cut off from the congrega¬ tion of the Lord. Now. some of the things which he has spoken of, as connected with this subject, the moral teachings, of secu¬ larism, are things which, in the main, I should not object to; because, as far as the propositions themselves go, they are very fair and correct. No doubt the physical part of man is to receive a due and proper attention; and I defy him to point out to me any Scripture which refuses to man that right. On the contrary, the Bible not only teaches him this right, but prescribes for him the methods how to use it. With regard to the intellectual part of man, I find in the Bible the clearest teachings there respecting tho intellectual nature of man; how that intellect is to be edu¬ cated ; how it is to find out truth in distinction from error; and above all, I find some of the most important reasons assigned why truth should be loved and error should be avoided. We are told that the secularist morality is to secure a very much better developed state of the human family, socially and civilly con¬ sidered; that the Biblo takes care of tho rights of kings and priests, and not of peoples. I deny the statement until my oppo¬ nent brings forward some passage of Scripture which says it is so, and then I will bring some forward which show that tho Bible insists upon kings ruling their peoples for " their good." That is Scripture language. Then I want to know what there is in secular morality that is sufficiently distinct and different from the morality of the Bible to justify him, or any other man, in trying-, first of all, to overturn the Bible morality before he is prepared to give us a perfect system of secular morality. We have an old brick house at present to live in, it may not be very perfect per¬ haps in all its parts, but we do not feel disposed to allow that to be pulled down for one built up of mud and dirt, which wo think is about all that secularism is prepared to do for us, if we are permitted to strip it of all that does not properly belong to it—if we are permitted to fake away all the good it has derived from that old Bible, so much despised, but which is not, by any secu- UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL</page><page sequence="52">48 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. larist in the world, understood. Secularism, he says, teaches us that man has a right to share in tho common bounties of nature. Well, the old Bible teaches that God is good to all, and that his tender mercies are over all his works—not merely his intelligent, responsible creatures, as men are, but over the lower animals oven, whom he supplies with food and with life, and whose creatures solely and entirely they are. Many passages of that kind might be quoted, if there were time, from the Psalms, as well as from other parts of the Scriptures. Now, while I am speaking upon this subject, let me just say that my remark about the animals, and the apparent injustice of their being put to death at the time of the deluge, clearly was not understood by you. If you and I deal unkindly and unjustly with tho animals, it is another thing, because they are creatures, in common with ourselves, in some respects, of the great Creator. They are not our property abso¬ lutely, but they are His property absolutely ; and not being moral or accountable beings, there can be no such thing on his part as injustice towards them. Wo have been told, if we come to look at the morality of the Biblo in detail, we shall find certain objec¬ tionable features about it which it is utterly impossible for us to remove; and, inasmuch as he has made so much of his favourite illustration, which nobody has been able to answer, I shall now try, before I do anything else, to answer him by dissecting that illustration. In the first place, if I did reside down south in America, it would not follow that I should imbibe southern notions on the subject of slavery, for there are some good men in South America, who abominate that system with all their soul and all their heart; and if it were found that I was amongst the few men having that feeling in South America, the whole of his illustration would fail, as far as I am concerned. But then I know it is a supposititious case. He meant to say, and that was fair and true, there are so-called Christians in South America who would reason in a similar manner to that in which he, in his illustration, has reasoned before us to-night. I say so much the more shame for them to do it; and I boldly take my stand here to-night—and am about to prove what I am going to assert—that they have no foundation whatsoever for that opinion with regard to their right to oppress a slave, founded upon the Word of God. They may have it in their creeds, they may have it in their church canons, they may have it in their customs, they may have it in their social and civil laws, which they have in the bitterest forms, but</page><page sequence="53">SECOND EVENING. 49 they have not any sanction for their conduct to the slave in the Word of God. We have had a passage quoted, that the Israelites might buy their slaves and bondmen from the heathen round about. There is no word answering to the word " bond" in the Hebrew text in any such passage; and the only way we can account for our translators putting it in at the time they made the translation, is by their own predilections in favour of slavery, which was practised at that time by this country. Moreover, the word you have in your English version for bond-servants, it is worthy of remark, was, after all, used honestly and cautiously by these men; for ha\ e you never noticed there are but two instances in the English Bible in which the word slave is used—one in Jeremiah, and the other in Revelations The one in Jeremiah is put in italics, the usual practice of our translators when they wished it to be understood that the word was not in the original, and only intended to complete the idiom of the English tongue; and the other in Revelations, where wo have the word bodies in the margin, signifying they were in doubt as to whether slaves, or merely the bodies of men, was the equivalent of the Greek term there used. Now, the word which is translated servant in our Bible, simply means a person hired to do a certain work. And I suppose we all admit it is lawful for the capitalist to hire the services of his fellow-men as labourers, provided he offers a just and legitimate price. Now, you will find that in every instance where tho children of Israel are spoken of as the ser¬ vants of the Lord, or of God, the self-same original word is used (the word Jibed, a servant, or one hired to labour). You will find, in those prophetic passages of Scripture where Christ is referred to, the same word used now. I would ask any man of common sense whether he is prepared to say the Israelites were God's slaves I have always heard them spoken of, particularly by secularists, as a people who were, in the most unjust and arbitrary manner, highly favoured by God abovo all other people ; and yet they are called Ebedim, or servants. The same word is used to denote hired servants whom they were permitted to hire or purchase. Was Christ a slave I make a further assertion with regard to the matter of slavery. There cannot be found a single instance in tho Biblo laws in which A was permitted to sell B to C, which is the modern notion of buying and selling a slave; A sells B to C, the buyer. But the Old Testament regula¬ tion was that A should sell himself to B for a term of years, and for a given hire; and, what was more, he took the money before D ma^^^^^mmn</page><page sequence="54">30 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. he entered on the service, so that, if there had been any savings banks in those days, he could have put it out to interest. That is the Bible rule, for this clear reason: if when he was hired he did not like his master, he could demand to be redeemed, and pay his master back again out of the money his master gave him at first to secure redemption thereby. That is clear. Then, again, every Jewish slave or servant (we use the word now in its common acceptation, having done with that part of the argument) went out perfectly free at the end of the seventh year; every foreigner went out free at the year of jubilee, whether the next year after the bargain were struck or not, without paying any part of the money back—not a fraction of it was he to pay back again. It is of no use to tell me the word " for ever" is there; that means till the end of the period, and nothing more. You may laugh; the context determines whether the period be one limited, as between so many years in time, or whether without any time limit, as it regards a future state. I lose nothing by that statement. Then, again, we find, regarding these slaves of tho Jows, there were certain laws for their management laid down in the Scriptures the direct reverse of what has been said to-night about the matter—as opposite as it was possible they should be to his statements con- corning them. It says in Leviticus that there should be one law for the stranger and one law for the home-born in all their land. They were thus to act one towards another: " Thou shaft not vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. Thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger. The Lord thy God regardeth not persons : he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger in giving him food and raiment. Love ye therefore the stranger; judge righteous judgment between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is within thy gates. Cursed be the man that perverteth tho judgment of the stranger." Does that look like sanctioning tho oppression of man by his fellow-man Certainly not. In all these passages the bondsman is recognised as a man, defended as a man, treated as a man, and to be received by all men as a brother. Now, besides, lot mo tell you again, if the servant did not like his master, and ran away (to come back to the illustration), if he became a poor fugitive, and came for protection, so far from tho Bible-man saying " I dare not protect you," he would say, " I not only desire, but am bound to protect you; for the Word of God commands me to protect you, and defies me to deliver you up again to the master</page><page sequence="55">SECOND EVENING. 51 from whom you have escaped, because you could not stand the injustice inflicted upon you." And for a trivial injury done to the eye or tho tooth he went out free, without giving anything back to his master, whatever his master might have paid for him, a month before even. I say you will find servants—hired servants for periods of time, for terms of years—but you will find no such thing as the modern notion of buying and selling men, and looking upon them as chattels and parts of property, in the whole Word of God. And if you ask me why Christianity or the New Testament says nothing about it, I will answer, because it lays down great principles which man is to be responsible for the application of to that and other evils ; and it does not therefore specify the evils for that reason. But its teaching is, that every man is a brother; and it is quite clear that where the doctrine of human brotherhood is entertained, the doctrine of slavery, according to the popular notion of it, is absolutely impossible. Now then, again, wo have been told to-night that the Bible idea of morality consists in this, and therefore it must tend to mischief; Believe, believe, believe " Faith is the highest standard of the Bible for morality!" I deny it. Love, sir, is the highest standard of tho Bible for morality. Tho Apostle Paul says, " Love is the ful¬ filling of the law." What more can you have? It is in the Epistle to the Romans, the 12th chapter, where Paul says, a good deal about love; I think it is the 12th or the 14th, but I could easily find it. Then in the Gospel of Matthew, where the Saviour was laying down a new moral code, he makes love more spiritual than it had boon perceived to be, though not than it was in its real nature—more spiritual than it had been perceived to bo by the Jews before his time, or of his time. What said he " On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength, and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." That is a higher- law, I fancy, if it be possible for there to be a higher law, than the one Iconoclast has just complained of—" Do unto others as yo would they should do unto you." But if the new secular rule is to take effect, please answer me this question:—If it bo a higher rule to teach men to do right, whether they would or would not that others should do the same to them, please tell me where the secular standard of right is; for there are three parties in the world at this moment trying to lead men by the noses after their opinions Which party am I to follow Am I to follow Joseph D 2</page><page sequence="56">52 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. Barker Am I to follow my respected opponent, who says he will bow to no man's teaching I respect him for that sentiment, but it does not follow I should bow to his on that account. Am I to follow Jacob Holyoake Am I to follow the Malthusian party Am I to follow the eclectic party If you want to know what these parties are, I think I can show you from the National Reformer, which I happen to have with me to-night. I should like to know one or two things before I sit down. First of all, what are the features of secularist morality, which we are called to look at as distinct from the Biblo idea of morality? If love, or beneficence, or a desire for the well-being of self and all the race, is a principle in secular morals, it is still higher and more per¬ fectly a principle—the principle—the grand unity in all morality, as taught by the Bible, viz., love or benevolence. What more can you have than that If that will not secure virtue, nothing will. Then I want to know what kind of sanction or inculcation we are to have in connexion with secular morality. Are we to have the inculcations of moral suasion I hope no other myself; upon my word, I do not want any other. Then it may thus happen : some men may not please to adopt that system any more than some have pleased to adopt the Christian system. What is to become of the outlying world when secularism is in the minority, as they tell us Christianity is now? I want to know if the sanctions on the contrary are to be vested in some legislative power, according to Volney's idea Because Volney admitted, when he had seen all empires ruined, that his genii, who had instructed him as to the fate of those empires, led him to discover a scene of probable, almost certain, confusion and anarchy springing up amongst the people, when they were delivered from their former oppressors; and inasmuch as they wanted all the intelligence and all the time of certain men to find out what was right as distinguished from what was wrong, a legislative assembly was set up for the new world. What shall we do, then Shall we have Owen, Paine, or Volney Who shall Ave have in this secular world Where is the secular Bible—that which contains the standard of morality Is it that book of moral science I hope not; for I have some things here of Robert Dale Owen's that are just of a kidney with it, and I shall have to say some strong things about them to this audience if that be his meaning. With two or three words I will sit down. All that is good in secularism has existed long before it, in better and stronger forms,</page><page sequence="57">SECOND EVENING. 53 in the despised old Bible. All that is not good in secularism has had its origin in secular humanity, and not in Christianized humanity; and all that is questionable and doubtful in morality has arisen out of the depraved state of man's intellect as to man's character. According to secular notions about what the world is, what nature is, and what we are, we do not know as yet whether we are existences or not, or only modes of it. All these things are in limbo for the present. But when they get them defined we shall want our inculcations! Now, Christianity has no inculca¬ tions beyond the native force of moral truth appealing by motive— the motive of reward and the motive of penalty—to the conscience and heart of mankind. Even under the old Jewish economy, if men did not render their duty to God as the law required, the legal authorities were not permitted, with one or two exceptions, to enter into judgment, but God himself dealt with them as delinquents. And if you will find me a code of morality, socially considered, apart from any duty which men may owe to God—if you will find me a secular code of morality more distinct than the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth commandments in that old book of Exodus—too antiquated to claim the notice of our would-be philosophers and scientific men of the present day—if you will find me anything better than these commandments, I am prepared to put the two together; and if they are better, I will take them. But I must know that they are better; I must know that the foundation on which these new moral precepts rest is better; I must know that the conditions of obedience are better; I must know that tho motive is more pure and spiritual; I must know, too, that the test of the obedience is more perfect, and that therefore humanity is to be raised up socially, intel¬ lectually, and morally, by a virtue which, whether found in the Bible or not, will be equal to tho accomplishment of that end, which I think my opponent desires to see as much as I do— though I believe he is in error as to how it is to be accomplished. The UMriRE again called " Time." Iconoclast :—I shall be extremely obliged if my friend, when quoting Scripture, will be kind enough to mention chapter and verse, because my objection to his quotations, as at present made, is, that some of them are not in the Bible—not in my edition of it—from beginning to end. [Mr. Barker .—Which?] My friend says, " Which." He may depend upon it I shall tell</page><page sequence="58">54 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. him plainly and distinctly before I sit down. And first of all I ask him—I do not say it is not there, because I may have over¬ looked it—to tell me in what part of the Bible it says that the strangers bought from the heathen as bondmen were to be released in the year of jubilee ?—because the whole of our friend's argument was based on that. I do not say he will not find it. I dare say he will bring it out as readily as possible. It may be like the "angel," or like the "preaching;" our friend may have got it from the whole of the Bible together. He may discover it in the Now Testament He may find it in Genesis. I would advise him, howevei', to look for it carefully; for I have looked for it from the beginning to tho end of the Bible, and whether I have missed it or no, I do not know, but I have not been able to find it. Then I may be right, and our friend wrong. Mark, he did not dare to quote the text which says that the heathen who were bought were to be discharged in the year of jubilee. He said so, but refrained, and was carefully reticent with chapter and verso; the only case in which he mentioned the chapter, he was kind enough to say he was not right. I will read chapter and verse, and I think my Bible knowledge will stand side by side with my friend's. And, first, as we have accepted the issue of slavery, we will take that, and try and dispose of it. He has gone to the Hebrews; I feel timid in following him so far. Ho has given us another translation. I thank him. There is only one objection to it, and that is, that it is not true; and that I shall be able to demonstrate to you, beyond the possibility of doubt, from tho English text itself. Our friend's proposition is this,—that men were never bought as actual slaves at all, but only hired out; that they hired themselves out, and received the money for it. Now, I will demonstrate to you from the Bible that it is not so. Our friend says we do not understand it. I retort, and say they do not read it, whether they understand it or not. Now I draw your attention to tho same chapter—tho 25th Leviticus. I may remark here that the Jews, according to the Pentateuch, had two sets of slave regulations—one for their own people, and another for the heathen ; and of those heathen it is expressly stated that the law provided that they might be bought, and left from children to children as slaves for ever. And I say that those to whom the jubilee applied were those of then' own people who had waxed poor and sold themsehes, and who were to be released in the year of jubilee. And that that is so, you</page><page sequence="59">SECOND EVENING. 55 will not have the slightest doubt when I road the text to you. But my friend ought to read the text to support his own proposi¬ tion, and it is not fair for him to charge me with not understand¬ ing the Bible, and then quote from it without defining the chapter and verse, and leave it simply to my unaided memory to find out whether he is right or wrong. It will show you, at any rate, whether I understand the Bible or not—if you consider only the two corrections I obliged my friend with in the last evening's debate—that I have taken some pains to comprehend what is in it. " If thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee,"—mark, not " sell himself,"—so that the being sold by others was completed. Our friend says it was not—that there was no buying by A of B of the slave C, but only the selling of a man by himself. Now, what does it actually say "If thy brother be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant: but as an hired servant"—showing that there was a clear distinction between thooe who were bondservants and those who were hired servants. And yet our friend tells you that " bond¬ servant " and " hired servant" are the same. Now I go a little further—to the 44th verse. This hired ser¬ vant is only to serve till the year of jubilee. " Both thy bond¬ men, and thy bondmaids moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall bo your possession. And ye shall take them as an inherit¬ ance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession ; they shall be your bondmen for ever." Then it goes on—" But over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another vith rigour. And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwclleth by liim wax poor, and sell him¬ self to the stranger or sojourner"—then he is to be redeemed at the end of the jubilee; but there is not one word in the chapter which I have been able to discover—and I have read it with considerable attention—not one word about the heathen being redeemed; there is no mercy for him, no kindness for him. He is a slave, and his manhood is not recognised. My friend says I am impeaching the " Southern States." No ; I am impeaching tho Bible, and stating, that if ho unfortunately resided in the South, he would be obliged to defend slavery as a Biblical institution. But what is even the treatment of the Jews that are to be released My friend has referred you to the Ten Commandments. Let him read the 21st chapter, which follows, and notice the com-</page><page sequence="60">56 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. mands which were given about the same time, and he will find that even those men who were to be released at the end of seven years, if they came in by themselves, were to go out by them¬ selves; and the wife and children given by the master were to continue the master's property. I ask my friend, who talks about hired servants, were these little children, born in slave wedlock, with the curse of slavery upon them from birth, were they hired servants? Did they sell themselves? But it will not do to be too strong upon this point, if my friend is going to find the text to refute me. He says that tho highest doctrine of Christianity is love. Will he be kind enough to tell me, if the highest form of Christianity is love, and if the way by which Christianity would spread itself is that affectionate way which he thinks would be so effectual, what is the meaning of Luke xix. 27: " But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay before me " What does it mean in the tenth chapter of Matthew, where it says, " that if the disciples go to preach to a city, and it will not receive them, nor hearken to their doctrine, they were to shake off the dust of their feet; and that it should he worse for that city than for Sodom and Gomorrah"? Where is the love in that? On the one side you have blood, murder, slavery; on the other side an eternity of torment in hell for the rejection of doctrines which the people could not receive. My friend says that Matthew xix. 12 does not recommend self-mutilation. He did not read it. How reticent my friend is on that Bible! He threatened us with reading from Robert Dale Owen and the National Reformer, but he took good care not to read many texts. Is it that the National Reformer and Robert Dale Owen must pass side by side with your Bible unchallenged I am no defender of Robert Dale Owen this evening; but I do behove he wrote to benefit man¬ kind, and I do declare that he never wrote of woman in language so foul, so loathsome, so disgusting, as you will find in passages of this Bible. My friend tells me I do quite right in not endorsing the whole of a book I quoted from. Now, to oblige him even, I do not like to endorse every word of it, because I do- not pin my faith to any man ; but I believe it to be as unobjection¬ able a book as ever I read in my life. There is not an improper phrase in it from beginning to end—not an indecent sentence. The man is a good, honest, thinking man. I know him, and honour him, and should feel honoured to be called his friend, as he called me when he gave me a copy of this book. But I</page><page sequence="61">SECOND EVENING. 57 cannot endorse the whole of the book, because he is a theist and I am an atheist; but I do believe he wrote it for the good of mankind, and that it is calculated to do mankind good if they receive it. My friend threatens me with what he will do if I read it. Now, I challenge him to do it. I think he is com¬ mitting the mistake of confounding it with some other book; but then our friend should understand, you see, what he is talking about, as well as quote correctly. He says that the Bible does not inculcate self-mutilation. What, then, does it mean when it says, " If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out" That is figurative, I suppose. But then there is hell fire; is that figurative Is the asceticism of the New Testament figurative I impeach that part which says there were some men who mutilated themselves for the kingdom of heaven's sake. Why did not Jesus reprove self-mutilation Why did he permit himself to speak so loosely about it, that one of the greatest bishops of the early churches mutilated himself because of it, and a great sect accompanied him, mistaking the meaning of the passage I pass that also, because we have very much more before us; and I now ask our friend to tell me how, if love is the pervading doctrine of the Bible, I am to understand those texts in the Old Testament, verified and repeated in the New—not in the same words, but in a worse sense—which say, that if a man or a woman, be he your own husband or she your own wife, come to you, and try to persuade you to forsake your religion, you shall kill her without mercy I ask, where is the love of your religion, when it has not confidence in itself, but is obliged to murder those who dare to try and lead you away from it And I assort, without fear of contradiction, that it is taught in express terms in the Old Testament, and is not only not revoked, but is made worse, in the New.—[A Voice :—Chapter and verse ?]—A friend asks for chapter and verse, and he shall have them. Nothing delights me more than to give a Christian chapter and verse; only let me suggest to him, that it would be a great deal better, when ho is asking for chapter and verse, if he would be kind enough to take the hint, and try and understand his own Bible. I will make that the topic of my next speech, and I will read to you tho pervading doctrines of your faith. I will begin with the Old Testament, and those portions of it which order a man to cut off the wife of his bosom, and I will carry on the subject to the New Testament. At present, and for the moment, I have one or two other portions of work to do. Our friend wants to know D 3</page><page sequence="62">58 MODEEN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. which of the secular parties he is to follow. Why, none. Be a man for yourself, and think for yourself. You have told us there are three secularist parties ; I do not believe it. I only know that truth is of no party, but includes all men who grapple for it; and I recognise not myself—a mere weak student of the moment—Holyoake, not Barker, not Soapy Sam of Oxford, not Charles Spurgeon, but look alike upon all .men, and honour those who strive for the truth. Which party shall you follow Shall it be Richard Weaver, the converted collier, or whatever he is Shall it be Charles Spurgeon, the brimstone and fire preacher Shall it be Harry of Exeter, who prohibits a clergyman from reading the Scriptures in bis diocese Shall it be Durham or Carlisle, who barter away a cure of souls Who shall it be You ask me this. I reply, I do not deal with persons. In my first speech I dealt with principles; but, if you will have men, I will produce them from your own church—your rotten church—and riving it to shivers, show you what it has been and what it is. The Chairman here rebuked a tendency in the audience to interrupt tho speaker by marks of approbation or disapprobation ; observing that he could not continue to act as umpire unless hisses and other similar interruptions were discontinued. Me. Baekee :—I am sorry that my friend should be at all disconcerted at my asking the question about the parties con¬ nected with the secular world. I did it because, to my mind, it had a very close and logical connexion with my proposition. The proposition speaks of the inculcation of secular morality, distinct from the Bible, as being able to raise man in his social, intellectual, and moral character, better than anything else— bettor, at any rate, than the Bible. Now, we Christians do not profess to follow parties at all, but we should he reduced to that necessity if we had not a Book to follow; and it was for that reason I asked the question of my friend, of which he has taken no notice, where the secularist bible is—whether it is in process of development, or already exists; and if it does exist, where I shall find it? I cannot study it till I find it, and that is impossible if it is in process of development! I simply want to know who is developing it, that I may have some conference with tho individual; perhaps I might throw out a few suggestions to help him, if I cannot materially alter his principles; because, " A man 's a man for a' that," though he be not an atheist!</page><page sequence="63">SECOND EVENING. 59 Therefore, I think my question was relevant. I do not wish him to make capital out of parties, sects, and names; for I do not see what they have to do with it: but if humanity is to be taken in the mass, and you are to educate physically, mentally, or morally, you must have some standard for that education. You cannot possibly do without it. I should like to know what the secularist standard is Perhaps he will tell you—self; but, while men are such different beings, there will be different predilections, dispositions, habits; and I should like to know how you could get at anything like a uniform scheme of morality by separate individual developments of mankind. It would be utterly impossible. It appears to me to be the most Utopian scheme ever heard of, or taught by man. I am told, however, by my friend, and he has published widely the statement, that it is because of the persecuting aspects of the Christian religion,— the imprisonments, fines, &amp;c, connected with that system,—that he has been led to stand forth as an " advocate (his own word), not professing to be impartial," to deliver men from priestcraft. Well, if men cannot be delivered from priestism without throwing over the Bible, it is a great pity. The book contains the very principles which would overturn all the priestism in the world. Our friend says that secularism, instead of teaching men to rely on priests, teaches that each man is his own priest. Well, that is as old as the book of Exodus, if not older; for the Israelites are there spoken of as a nation of kings and priests, and the senti¬ ment is endorsed by the Apostle Peter in his first epistle, where he says, " a chosen generation, a holy priesthood, a royal nation," —speaking of Christians. And in the book of Revelations we are spoken of as redeemed unto God, and made kings and priests. The priesthood of the believer is tho doctrine of the Bible, and tho priestism of the Church is the abuse of that doctrine. But I have been challenged to deal somewhat more with slavery, and I shall be very glad to do it, because I think my friend wants to be set right on that subject. I do not think he loves slavery more than I do; and I do not think any man with common sense can find slavery in tho Bible, by any fair mode of interpreting it. There was one passage in the 25th of Leviticus, which I should have liked him to quote. I think he did not, or if he [did, I have forgotten. If he says he did quote it, of course you will understand that I am in error. The verse has reference to the liberation of the captives in the j'ear of jubilee— the tenth verse: " And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and</page><page sequence="64">60 MODEEN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof"—not the servants, but the inhabitants. The word Yashav there used is a very emphatic one : it means every man that sittoth down, every squatter, every man that had a tent in the whole of the borders of Israel, was to be set free in that year,—every dweller in the land, without respect to age, be he Jew or not, in the fiftieth year, was to go free. Now, I take my stand upon this simple statement, and I believe that American Christians, as well as others, who have argued that slavery is taught in the Bible, have run their heads against a wall, because they have not observed this simple fact. I do, then, still deny that my opponent can find any evidence that the buying and selling of men, as it exists in modern times, was taught or practised among the children of Israel; and even if it be taught and sanctioned in the Leviticai law, I say again, that tho man himself received the price of his own service. My friend took no notice of my statement, that there was no Hebrew word equivalent to the word " bondservant." I defy the best Hebrew scholar in the world to find it in that or in any other text relating to slavery. I did not say that the words "bond" and " hired" were equivalent, but that you will find eases where the word "hired" is used, and there you have an equivalent for it in the Hebrew text; but you have not one case where the word " bond" is used in the original, or a word equivalent to it. And I say again, I know no other reason why the translators should have put that word in, except perhaps their Roman notions about slaves, or some desire to justify a custom in which this country was engaged for filthy lucre's sake. But let us look again at my friend's quotations. He has quoted Exodus, and has a great objection to a passage in the 21st chapter, which contains an account of a simple regulation. I call it simple, for when it is looked at in all its connexions, I think it is much more simple than he has represented it to-night. He seems very angry, indeed, that a man should go out free alone, and leave his wife and children behind; and so should I, —if the man were compelled to do so—if the Jewish law gave the master power to sell him, when his caprice or want of money prompted him to do so. But he could not do that. There cannot be found in the Old Testament a single passage to show that a master might sell his slave without his consent. I simply ask for the text, and I v ill then deal with it. Here is a man who goes in unmarried:-—he accepts a wife who is also her</page><page sequence="65">SECOND EVENING. 61 master's hired servant, or maid, for a term of years; he accepts her, marries her, with the distinct understanding that it is so ; and if he pleases to go out without her it is his own act, for his master cannot compel him. The vileness and iniquity of the American system, which you refer to the Bible, is that a parent can be separated from a child, a husband from a wife, at the will of the master. If a man likes to leave his wife, I do not know but what he may be permitted to do so—at any rate, the onus of doing it rests on himself; but my opponent did not read what follows—that if a man, influenced by a regard to his master, or his wife and children, who were in the same house, wished to pre¬ serve the sacred relationship into which he had been brought, he should simply say so, and his master was bound to keep him, and he should go to the authorities of the city and have his ear bored by the judges, as a sign of perpetual service. My friend makes a great deal of use of the word "for ever," in Leviticus, but he did not deal with my statement about it, which was, that the word there used simply means to the end of the period; that it has no other meaning, and that the character of that period, whether short or long, was to be determined by the context, and other fair modes of criticism to be applied to the cases indi¬ vidually as they arise. It is this unfair manner of dealing with the Biblo that has brought about half the mistakes connected with it; and Christianity itself has suffered by allowing the decisions of councils, the teachings of the Fathers, and the current opinion of certain times and periods, to take the place of the direct teaching of the Word of God. That is where the Church has suffered. She is suffering, this very day, the leprosy that has been self-inflicted upon her by her own foolishness in breathing this impure secular atmosphere instead of the spiritual atmosphere of heaven; and while she thus breathes that atmo¬ sphere, she will never have a good, healthy constitution, and a vigorous offspring. We do not wish for any unfair play on either side. We are quite willing to admit the defects of systems, and the defects of men allied to systems. My friend wants to know how it was that Jesus Christ did not reprove the practice of the class of men referred to. I do not know that I can tell him. I suppose if Christ were here he could, if he thought it worth while; bat I always thought that a teacher with the Divine authority that he had had a right to teach, and to teach directly, without always giving a direct, distinct reason for his teaching. He certainly has not shown us that Christ n</page><page sequence="66">62 MODEEN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. approved of the self-mutilation. The discussion between Him and his disciples arose in connexion with the question of divorce. The Saviour said, " Well, under Jewish law, divorce was per¬ missible ;" but if you want to know my opinion upon it, it was not so from the beginning. Through the hardness of your hearts it was permitted to take effect. " But," he says, " it is not to bo so now; and I lay it down as a rule that whosoever putteth away his wife, except for such and such a cause, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is divorced committeth adultery." But the disciples, who had a great difficulty in this matter about the Master's teaching, said, " Well, then, according to this (for they had the old Jewish notions about divorce acting on their minds) if it be so, a man had better not be married at all than be bound all his life to a woman, excepting for the extreme case permitting divorce which you have laid down." The Saviour said, " All men cannot receive that." What Not what he had said, but what the3r had said. " All men are not in a position to remain in a single state, which you think preferable. They cannot receive that state¬ ment. It is true there are some who have done it—who have mu¬ tilated themselves, and have been by others; and there are some born with the natural gift to refrain from the rights and privileges of the married state; but your view of the thing cannot take effect. All men cannot receive what you have said." This is the light in which I take the Saviour's words ; and I do not consider him for a single moment as acknowledging or encouraging in the slightest degree the thing referred to. My friend, you remember, did not mention the case as one in which his mind was in any doubt or difficulty which he wished to remove—ho mentioned it as one of the bond fide reasons or objections which he entertained against the Bible. Therefore he has settled it in his mind that there is no possible interpretation except what he has affixed to it. We can relieve him from that difficulty. Now, I am far from dealing with my Bible in this way, I say again, you can find no evidences at all, by any fair interpretation of the Word of God, that the monstrous idea of slavery which you attach to it is there, or that the God of the Bible is amenable for it. The Umpire called " Time." Iconoclast :—I am extremely sorry that our friend had so much to talk about that he forgot to give me the text of the Bible which proved that the heathen bought as slaves were to be</page><page sequence="67">SECOND EVENING. 63 released in the year of jubilee. In my previous speech I drew attention to the fact that the early regulations of the chapter were for the Jews alone; and if he tells me that they were not, in his next speech, then I shall claim the right—as he has referred this evening to a previous debate—I shall claim the right to show on the following evening the dilemma into which he will fall. I tell him that the words which I read were a special regulation apply¬ ing to the heathen around, and that he was mistaken when he said that the Bible provided for the relief of those heathen in the year of jubilee. Now, my friend has again been reticent in his quotations. He has referred vaguely to the Bible, and in dealing with Matthew, his own language as to what Jesus meant to say was far preferable to what he found in the text—-what Jesus did say. Half-a-dozen brackets are put into the text and our friend's explanations, and I must say it reads ever so much better with his explanations. " I admit," he says, " that it is not very easy to explain it; if Jesus were here perhaps he might explain it, if he thought fit." And that is my friend's defence of it, against the secularist's attacks this evening. Certainly it is unanswerable; I admit that at once. What Jesus might say if he were here I shall not attempt to reply to; and I only ask you to remember that the advocate of the Bible this evening, being pressed with a passage, so far from endeavouring to explain it, is obliged to excuse himself, by telling you that the Divine teacher was not obliged to give his reasons—that he cannot possibly say what they were—and that ho cannot say what the teacher might say to explain them. I leave that to pass to another subject. I suppose our friend's argument did not apply to self-mutilation, but he ought to have said whether or no the text I referred to, " If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out," is to bo read figuratively or literally.. If figuratively, he will be obliged to make the whole a figurative form of speech; and then what becomes of the worm that never dieth He did not tell us if " for ever" means only to the end of the period in the Old Testament, whether that is the meaning of it in the New, where it speaks of being burned for ever; if not, how are we to distinguish between a fifty years for ever and a for ever of more than fifty years 1 cannot explain it. I cannot understand the Bible in these respects. I am here as an inquirer, and my friend is a teacher; and I ask him to tell me, if he can, what is the meaning of "for ever"? Let us see. It means till the year of jubilee. It was a strange thing that the stranger</page><page sequence="68">64 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. should be left as an inheritance for ever, for the Israelite himself, and his children after him, if only fifty years was referred to. It sounds strangely contradictory. Our friend tells you that he never meant to argue that "bondservant" and "hired servant" mean the same. Does he mean to tell you that there is a distinc¬ tion—if so, what distinction He says ho does not mean there is no distinction. Well, if there be a distinction, what is it I tell you what the distinction is. The one was bought and paid for, and was a slave; and if the master happened to beat him, if he died on the fourth day, the master simply got no money for him. He was part of his master's chattels. My friend said that if a master knocked out his slaves's eye or his tooth, the slave was to go free; but mark, it was with less ability to earn his food and to fight out the battles of life. This is all the redress the God of the Bible gives the slave when his master maims him. If the slave smites his master, woe be to him ; but if the master smites the slave, the slave is turned out into the world helpless to fight his way through it. You say there were no slaves in the Bible in the sense in which there are slaves in America now. I admit it. The slavery of the Bible, horrid as is slavery in America, far outdoes it. You and I unite in hating slavery as a curse. Secularism knows no slavery, it teaches the equal rights of mankind; but your Bible does in some form or other, as I have shown, give to man the right to buy, sell, and traffic in human flesh and blood. Oh, but you refer to his wife and children. Well, let us examine that. You and I probably both have a wife and children. Let us take it we were bought as slaves; that we sold ourselves, if you will, though the Bible does not always put it so. Let us take it that there is a form of redemption. We are bought; we have the money, the price of our service; yes, our slavery. We have a wife; our siave wife, who is also a slave. We have children. What then Why your Bible says this, and I defy you to disprove it. I will do better; I will prove it before I sit down, that no avenue of dis¬ proof may remain open to you. Your Bible says that if the man comes in by himself he shall go out by himself; if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him; if bis master have given him a wife, and she have borne him children, they and his wife shall be his master's and he shall go out alono. What becomes then of my friend's argument, that they were only hired servants, when the man has only been used as a slave breeding- machine to get other slaves—stamped with a slave's curse upon his brow Immoral book, I denounce it! Oh, but you say, tho</page><page sequence="69">SECOND EVENING. 65 slave had a door left open to him. Yes, he had, if he liked his master. Why did not you read the text I will do so for you. " If the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go out free;" and who^being a man, would not under the circumstances say, I love my master, the wife of my bosom, and the children whom I have nursed on my knee I do not ask whether a man can love a slave-master, whether there can be love between a master, who has bought a slave with gold, and the slave. It is impossible; for between the slave and the tyrant there can be no love. There can only be love between the free and the true. Love between the slave and the master who holds him in slavery cannot happen. But what is to be the reward of the slave who will not leave his wife—his beautiful wife, perhaps, in the custody of her slave-master, nor his children whom he loves—what is to be his reward Our friend told you&gt; but he glossed it over finely. I will read the passage to you : " Then his master shall bring him to the judges ; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever." Our friend says, "for ever" is only fifty years; but, if fifty years, then it is an unlawful fifty years; fifty years too long : and I impeach the Bible which imposes it; and I declare that secularism, which denounces it, is more moral by far. You ask for a secularist bible, a secularist faith. You tell me, that if I show you the man who is composing this bible you will give him some hints. Understand your own Bible first! Be well versed in its texts, make no misquotations from it, and then you will be able to understand and help to compose others. You want to know where the secularist bible is. I tell you, in every book opened to him, in portions even of your own Bible, for what book is wholly bad Every book has some flower that may be plucked. As every one derives his notion of beauty, in the abstract, from the beauty he sees around him—so, from every man and every age we pluck the flowret truth, and make one grand bouquet of truth, which, lifted up, shall perfume tho world with fragrance. You ask for the secularist's bible—for the secularist's faith. I answer, it is not in this man or in that man, or in any other man; it is not in this, or that, or any land; but in all men, and everywhere. In every poet whoso poesy breathes forth words of humanity, there will I find it. In every orator who has spoken for truth and liberty, there will I find secular teaching. When Voltaire's wit and genius were united to rescue peoples %</page><page sequence="70">66 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. from a state of slavery and subjection in which kings and priests held them down, there was secular teaching. When Robert Owen, patient and untiring, went through a life of kindliness and brotherhood, striving to make men better, there was secularism. When Garibaldi strove to set the people free, there you found secular effort. In an age when the world was down-trodden, when kings and priests who, you say, were upheld by God, pressed their iron heels upon suffering peoples, there you find secularism, in words of thunder, shaking to pieces rotten systems of government. When, in America, corrupt government taxed and tyrannized over the people,—then, when words of common sense came out in a crisis, and galvanized the dead body of the nation—there you find secular teaching. You ask me where secular teaching is. I turn to every library of the world, and there I find it in records of law—not through your Biblo, but against it; not through your church, but in opposition to it— persecution and tyranny have been put down. It is not hi the teachings of your Bible, which tells you, that if tho wife of your bosom entices you away from its religion—or, it may be, the friend dear to thee as thine own soul, or the mother that gave you birth—but I will read the language in Deut. xiii. 6. If any of these " entice thee secretly, thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: but thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be the first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people." Yes, even tho wife of thy bosom, whom thou art bound to pro¬ tect, to cherish, and to love: if she dare to have an heterodox thought—then, if you believe this Bible, which has not been repealed, you are to have no mercy nor pity, but are to raise the hand against her, and smite her to death. I say, " Cursed, in¬ human religion, I impeach you!" Me. Baekee.—I really think it is hardly necessary, if you Will recall what I have said before to-night, to reply to the tilings said in this speech of my friend about slavery- You know he will persist in contradicting my statement, that the buying and the selling which accords with modern notions of slavery finds no part in the Bible. I say again—I assert it—let any man go to the Bible for himself, and see whether it is so or not, that the buying and the selling there was equivalent to the hiring a man for a period of years, and no more. Now, he</page><page sequence="71">SECOND EVENING. 67 might have read from the 2oth chapter of the book of Leviticus some passages which were not read by himself any more than by me. We are told in that chapter, for instance, just what I have said, that a man selling himself for a term of years had the right of purchasing his own redemption. We are told that his master that bought him should reckon with him, from the year he was sold, to the year of jubilee, and the price of his redemption was to be according to the number of years, according to the time of a hired servant: " If there be yet many years behind, he shall give again tho price of his redemption out of the money he was bought with." He shall give it again. Then the man must have had it, or he could not have given it back. What I contend for is, that that which is called buying and selling in the Bible, is a case in which the man makes a bargain himself with his master, receives the money down upon the nail, and does what he likes with it, even to tho redemption of himself, if he pleases, before the term of servitude expires. About his wife; I say that both he and his wife had the same rights of liberty. He could buy his wife, and there was no law in the Jewish Scripture to prevent it, if he had money to do it. More than that, at the year of jubilee both he and his wife, and all his little ones, would be free. For that which I have referred to again and again I still contend for, that though they were to be the possession of tho master and his children, it was only until the year of jubilee, and it is no use for my friend to suppose, because he has started what he thinks a difficulty in connexion with the meaning of the word " for ever," that I shall shrink from my point on that ground. I shall tell you on another night what the term " for ever " means, when we come to New Testament passages, because I shall abide by my rule, that the context of a passage determines the extent and force of the meaning of its individual terms. Now, in the book of Exodus I think you will see, from a passage I shall now quote, that my view of what is meant by the hiring, and buying and selling of men for servants, is a perfectly legiti¬ mate one. In the 21st of Exodus you find, ' he that stealeth a man and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, w hether ho sell him or not, shall surely be put to death." My friend wants to know how I can account for the severity of those laws which he has been reading from in the 13th chapter of the book of Deute¬ ronomy. Well, I say those laws established extreme penalties for what I may call an extreme and necessary purpose. The great object of God, in preserving the Jewish people distinct from the</page><page sequence="72">68 MODEEN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. other peoples of the world, was to preserve the Jewish religion from all those impure connexions and deteriorations which it must have suffered by connexion with the heathenism around. And so far from his intending, and wishing to do this for any arbitrary purpose, the great object he had in view was that of preserving the grand system of types and representations of the Christian religion intact for the good of the whole world here¬ after. If the Jews had been permitted, with their tendencies to idolatry and unfaithfulness, to have departed from the religion of their fathers without some extreme penalty to prevent it, they probably would have done so even more than they did. They not only would have been sacrificing their own interests, but they would, in the nature of things, have been sacrificing the interests of other generations and of other peoples, who were to be directly and indirectly benefited by the faithful discharge, on their part, of their duties. The Jewish economy had an end to answer in regard to the welfare of the world—one which accounts for its existence—and its existence is not accountable for on any other ground. But upon that ground it can be accounted for; and although there were in connexion with it some extremely just, and, if you like the word better, say severe laws, they were for the express purpose of preserving more sacredly and completely truths, wrapped up in that economy for our good, as well as for the good of the men of that generation. Again, I ask my opponent to-night if he will, instead of talking about poetry and imagination, instead of talking about individual rights and liberties (wo can say quite as much upon those subjects as he can), define to us clearly and distinctly some better system of morality than that which we find in the Word of God. For mark you, if the Bible bo not the Word of God, and my friend does not believe it is—he disavows it to-night; he says he will trample it under foot—"No, no "—he said he denounced it; that was his word. He said he denounced it, and would denounce it; and if that is not trampling upon it—I speak figuratively—what does it mean Laugh at it, if you please; correct the laws of language before you deny me the right. I say he said ho would denounce it. But mark you, upon his own showing, viz., that it is not a Bible from God, the revealed will of God, it must be a secular book according to his own showing; and if secularism has any better than this, let us see it. We must have his system first to compare with it, before we can say whether it is better. If secularism has had this opportunity in the past of bringing its</page><page sequence="73">SECOND EVENING. 69 collective wisdom to bear—I speak from their point of view, for I give as much as I can to my opponent in an argument—how is it that, with as much wisdom as they could bring to bear upon the framing of that book, they have framed it so imperfectly I should like to know how or on what principle he can expect men, now, by the mere light of reason, to form a better book than the Bible Nothing I have seen yet, or read, in connexion with secular science, so called, or socialism or deism, will bear one moment's comparison with the morality of the Word of God, if you take the book as a whole. And now I shall, just before I sit down, give you one or two of my special reasons for the position which I occupy to-night, as against the secularist propositions which have been laid before us this evening. Five minutes will do, for I shall not want any peroration to my speech; I am here to argue, not for any other purpose. I go for these principles— another day will show how far they can be sustained or not—I go to show that secularism, because it makes man a material being, and denies to him a future life, cannot supply an adequate motive for intellectual culture, or the consistent practice of morality. I go, secondly, to show that secularism, which denies the being of a God, cannot give an adequate definition of virtue, which, should there be a God, must have special reference to his character, and to his relations to us, and ours to him. Nor can secularism, which, according to its own showing, has different phases and different leaders, each of whom is doubtless as desirous of organizing and moulding society according to his own con¬ victions as my friend, on this account be competent to develop mankind as they should be developed. That secularism, which is now only in a condition of development, is not entitled at present, at any rate, to be a leader and teacher for mankind. This pro-, position is more especially true, because it asks us—ere its own system is perfect—to leave those principles which have stood the storm of ages, and are now stronger in the world than ever they were. I say again, that notwithstanding the commendable lives and intentions of modern secularists, all the principles they hold, when logically followed to their conclusions, must result in things as bad as Owenism ever could have resulted in, if it had been carried out; and must result also in cruelties as great, if not greater, than those which have been the incidental effect of the truth that is in the Bible. In the next place, I will show there is nothing good or true in secularism, in common with religion at large, which wo have not possessed a very much longer time than we</page><page sequence="74">70 MODEEN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. have known anything about secularism, and which we are too much satisfied with to give up for anything that has been hitherto presented to us. Next, Christianity, as a system of moralityxhas for its foundation, and its rule and end of action, the most perfect motives and reasons which the mind of man can conceive of; for its foundations are not physical harmonies which we hear so much about, nor personal predilections, nor idealities, nor expediencies, but one grand law or principle of love, benevolence, beneficence 5 and the condition of moral good, as given by Divine truth, is not a fallible, changing thing, with every man's temper and disposition, but the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever, like its great Author. The moral teachings of the Scriptures show us that the intentions and motives of a moral agent are of more importance in deter¬ mining his character than the actions he performs. The foundations and conditions of moral action being so spiritual and absolute, it is rendered both possible and necessary that moral agents should be accountable for their actions and intentions upon a basis constructed on the foundation of their moral constitution, and tho mind and moral constitution of their great Lawgiver, whom we believe to be God. Take away the Divine Being from the universe, take away human accountability to that God, and you cannot show any firm foundation for virtue. You may reason upon it; you may talk about it; you may have a great many floating ideas about it; you may be happy, and prosperous, and pure ; but every good idea of that kind you have gained, you have inherited from the old despised Book, not¬ withstanding all you say against it. You have not these ideas in lands where it has not been; you have not these ideas in coun¬ tries where men have not been enlightened by its teaching; so Ahat science—intellectual, general, and moral—you find in advance in those lands where the Bible is; and this you have to account for. You may go to Mahometan countries; you may go to Rome —I deny that Rome is in any sense in which we are now speaking a Christian country, I say that Rome has not the Christianity of the Bible, and I am not here as a Romanist, I am here as a Bible Christian, and nothing more than that—and I say again, if you take away the Word of God, not the Roman church, not the Greek church, not the Anglican church, not my church, not any church; if you take away the Bible, you take away the founda¬ tions' of morality, because you take away the evidence of the being of a God.

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1862. Subject :—Is the doctrine of Original Sin, as taugh t in the Bible, theoretically unjust and practically pernicious On the motion of Mr. Whitmore, the Secretary of the Joint Committee, the CnAlRMEN of the meeting were withdrawn, and the meeting was left entirely in the hands of the Umpire, James Harvey, Esq. The Umpire having made a few opening remarks, the Rev. W. Barker opened the subject of debate as follows:—Friends, the subject which we have to discuss to-night is, I think you will all admit, a very important one, and requires to be dealt with calmly and considerately. I do not think that rash statements on either side will at all facilitate a right conclusion in the matter. The proposition has been read to you by the Umpire, and it devolves upon me, rather curiously, to affirm a negative. But I shall avoid doing that by endeavouring to establish a positive proposition of my own in relation to the one which has brought us together to-night. I shall affirm in the commence¬ ment, that tho Bible doctrine of original sin is not irrational, and not pernicious in its effects or in its workings, and I shall endeavour to sustain this in my opening speech by certain argu¬ ments, such as will call for a thoughtful and temperate answer on the part of my opponent. I do not, however, in discussing the subject this evening, propose to go into the details connected with the Fall, any more than I am really obliged to do. I do not propose, for instance, to trace tho genealogy of the serpent, if I could; nor do I propose to inquire what sort of a thing the for-</page><page sequence="77">THIRD evening. 73 bidden fruit was which our first parents partook of; nor do I know that I can say much very positively or definitely about the original physical constitution of man; although, perhaps, I may throw out a few hints upon that subject. We are not, in fact, to deal with the details of this question this evening, but to treat it in its more broad, practical, and important aspects. I feel a degree of liberty in the discussion of this question, from the circumstance that I am not here to defend John Calvin, or Augustine, or Arminius, or anybody else of note in the history of the Christian church who has written upon this subject, and whose works have, more or less complete, come down to our times. I have to take the old book—the Bible—the book which is equally open to every one of us to study, and to form his judg¬ ment upon; and which undoubtedly contains, if the subject is discussed anywhere, a full representation of all that can be known in regard to it. I think, however, that I shall be obliged to say a few things by way of introduction concerning the constitution of the first man, as well as the position and condition which he occupied in the garden of Paradise. I take it, then, that God had an end in view in the creation of the first man in a state of perfect manhood, with his bodily powers perfect at first, from the beginning of his existence ; and so also with his mental powers, or his intelligence, perfect in its parts, if we may speak of parts; and also his moral powers, as associated with his sentient and intelligent faculties. In all these three respects, I take it, we find it laid down in the Scriptures, either in tho Old or New Testament, or perhaps rather by a com¬ parison of tho two, we arrive at the just conclusion—that man was thus perfectly created by God in tho first instance; and I assume for the time being, that it was in order that he might become tho subject of moral government, that by a law within himself, as well as in the nature of things, and also by a law very shortly afterwards given to him by God, ho might be enabled to regulate bis conduct;—that there might be a correspondence between the law within him and the law given to him. With regard to his condition, you will observe in Genesis—I deem it unncccssaiy to quote chapter and verse every time, unless it be called for, because I presume you arc all well acquainted with the narrative, even those who disbelieve it—you will observe, that the condition of man in the first place was somewhat different to what it was when God gave to him the law which ho afterwards broke. Wo are told in Genesis, that the Lord gave the whole E</page><page sequence="78">74 modern atheism and the bible. earth into his care, that he might be fruitful and multiply upon it, subduing the things in the waters and on the land, and having dominion over the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the air; so that man was, in a certain sense, the lord of the creation on earth. But, subsequently to this, God formed the garden of Eden, and placed him there in connexion with many physical delights, and, afterwards, with social delights too. In the garden of Paradise, however, we find it was that the law was. given to man, and that law had reference to one particular thing, and no more. But there was an implied reference, I think, to the tree of life also, which man had access to in a state of innocence. The tree of life has been thought by some to have been actually a means of preserving man immortal, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil as simply a test of his obedience to the will of his God: in order that by his thoughts and feelings, with regard to that tree, he might know the state of his mind towards his Maker, and be able always to realize whether or not he obeyed his Maker's will, and was morally complete or perfect in his Maker's sight. How long man stood in that condition, I deem it altogether frivolous, as well as unnecessary, to inquire. What ws have to do with is, rather, the means by which man fell from that position of perfect happiness and perfect holiness—I believe he was perfectly holy then—and also with the consequences of his fall; perhaps more especially with these than with anything else. With regard to the process, we are told that temptation assailed the man, or rather, in the first instance, the woman, and then, secondly, the man; so that ultimately both the woman and the- man fell from the integrity which they possessed, and sinned against God, entailing upon themselves and their posterity many evils. I said before, that I am not going to attempt to tell you who or what the tempter was. I assert my own belief merely in this ease, when I say, that whatever might have been the character of the creature employed, the principal agent in this work was Satan, the enemy of God and the enemy of man. The question will probably be here asked, why God, if he made man holy and also happy, should expose him to temptation, when he saw—as a Being possessed of foreknowledge—-what would be the result, of that exposure To this let me answer, in the first place, that it appears to me impossible that a moral agent, being a mere creature, whether an angel or a man, should be so circum¬ stanced in relation to good or evil, as to be beyond the reach of temptation—absolutely so. I think that the nature of tempta¬ tion is such, that it does not require that there should be an</page><page sequence="79">third evening. 70, external agent to come and act upon or influence the mind of an intelligent being, in order to bring sin to pass. We should remember, that though we have very little said about it in the Bible, yet we have some intimation, sufficient perhaps to enable us to conjecture, if no more, upon the introduction of evil among the angels. We cannot suppose that in a world like heaven, and among an entirely holy race of beings, as we believe all the angels were then, there could have been any external tempter in the shape of a free voluntary agent, who sought to do evil. But are there not properties in the mind of a creature, such as the desire of more knowledge, which may spontaneously, and by their own action, run to excess, unless they are specially preserved, or kept in order by a higher, even a Divine power If so, you will find in that case what very much accords with our own expe¬ rience in some things now. Wo find evil suggested to the mind, by things which in themselves are perfectly lawful and innocent. The working of our own minds is the source of the evil thoughts in that case ; but in the case of our first parents the evil was suggested by a voluntary agent, called Satan in tho Scrip¬ tures. The temptation, therefore, of our first parents must be looked at carefully by us; and, to make the matter still clearer, I have a few propositions which I wish to lay down for the con¬ sideration of this meeting, and of my opponent. I hold, then, that every creature must have some law to guide his actions, and to teach him what he ought to do, or what he ought not to do. I hold again, that no responsible creature can be holy, or enjoy intelligent intercourse with his Maker, without a lule of action, feeling, and desire. The forbidden tree was to Adam the test of his own feelings towards God. So long as they were right, he was happy. The brutes had no moral law, because they have no abilityfor the intellectual or moral enjoyment of God. The thoughts of tHe creature about the law it has to obey may become evil with or without a tempter, for everything on which the mind can think has two aspects. The tree was good in itself; but was to be abstained from for the sake of higher good, which was more valuable to man. Satan therefore called the attention of the woman to the natural properties of the tree as being good, and Eve was influenced by them to forget still higher good, which she could only observe by abstaining from the lesser good. A thing injurious, entirely evil, or a thing entirely neutral, can hardly become a temptation to an intelligent creature. If the tree of knowledge of good and evil had been absolutely pernicious and deadly in its properties, it would have been E 2</page><page sequence="80">76 modern atheism and the bible. difficult to perceive how the woman could have desired to partake of it. If it had been absolutely neutral, having .no properties to be desired, it would be equally difficult to conceive how, then, she would desire to touch it. But when we conceive of it as a thing good for food, pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make men wise, then we can see that— provided some false estimate of its value should be formed by the woman, under any sort of delusion, however induced—she might trespass upon the law of God, and touch the tree ; and we can account for the trifling with the higher interests which were involved in that action. If nothing be bad—if nothing could be a temptation to wrong—nothing could be a direct means of good, and all action would be merely mechanical ; neither joy nor woe could be felt by angels or men. Now I hold, that there are two or three things in connexion with a position such as that which our first parents held which one should keep in view, in order to form a correct estimate of this matter; namely, that in connexion with every responsible, intelligent being, there will be privilege, responsibility, and temptation. I do not see how you can separate these three things from each other. I think you will find that they are essential elements in all the states and conditions of moral government among angels or men, or any intelligent creatures who are the subjects of law, and who are responsible to a higher power. Now let me go a little further, and speak of the fall of man. It has been usual to trace that fall more or less to unbelief. Unbelief, undoubtedly, was one of the elements in the sin which was committed. I do not think it was the first. I think the first element was pride. I can hardly conceive that the first element was a desire for physical, carnal gratification, although that was not excluded from the act, and formed a part of tho motive under which the woman acted when she partook of the tree; it seems to me that the desire to be wise, without subjecting herself to the legitimate means for becoming wiser, was perhaps the principal thing that influenced her mind, and probably Adam's afterwards. The action was sinful in connexion with what Satan said, and the influence brought home to her mind by her conversation with him. In the first instance, the tempter tried to throw discredit upon the fact that God had said any¬ thing about the tree at all. When he found that he could not do that, then he tried to throw discredit upon God's intentions— to make it appear to the woman, that so far from its being bene¬ volent on his part to withhold the tree from her, it was an act which God himself ought not to have committed. Thus we</page><page sequence="81">third evening. 77 find that this was the point where her natural powers, which were in themselves good, by the false action arising out of these wrong impressions concerning the Divine character, and this placing of the mere secondary good in the position of a higher good in regard to her own affections, led her to sin; and that process, it appears to me, constitutes in part, if not wholly, the mystery of sin in all ages, in all its aspects, and under all developments of it. With regard to the consequences of this sin, I must make a few remarks; and I shall begin by taking this position. I cannot find anything in the Scriptures to warrant me in believing that the eternal interests of men are sacrificed by the first transgression of our first parents. It appears to me that the Bible speaks very strongly and positivel yon this point; and I do not know of any portion of Scripture where, in a more con¬ centrated and definite form, this matter is touched upon than in the 18th chapter of Ezekiel. There are several of the strongest possible statements there, and I shall just refer to one or two of them and pass on, leaving you to judge whether I am right or not in supposing that they teach directly that God does not destroy one human soul for the sin of another human soul, whether for the sin of Adam, or any one else. The children of Israel bad an impression that God's ways were in this respect unequal; and, therefore, it had come to be a proverb amongst them " that the fathers had eaten sour grapes, and that the children's teeth were set on edge." To this God answers, " As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel. Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die." Then in the 10th verse it says, " If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any of these things (specify¬ ing a number of things in the three following verses he had done) (v. 13) all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him." On the other hand, " If he beget a son that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like, then—having executed (v. 17) God's judgments and walked in his statutes, he should not die for the iniquity of his father—he should surely live." Then in the 23rd verse, " Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die saith tho Lord God: and not that he should return from his ways, and live " Then in tho 25th verse, " Tet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now O house of Israel; Is not my way equal are not your ways unequal ?" " Yet saith the house of Israel (v. 29), The way of the Lord is not</page><page sequence="82">1TB MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. equal. 0 house of Israel, are not my ways equal are not, your ways unequal? Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions ; so iniquity shall not be your ruin." Now, I take it that those statements, together with others which might be taken from the same chapter, most positively assert the truth I have just laid down. There is an apparent exception to this in tho book of Exodus, chapter 34. You find there a reference made to God's visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children, on the one hand, to the third and fourth generation; and, on the other hand, his showing mercy to thousands of generations. But the verses that have reference to the visitation of the sins of the fathers upon the children—more especially the 7th verse—have, I take it, two limitations. The one not drawn from the texts themselves, but from the concurrent testimony of Scripture at large—namely, that it is utterly impossible that the state¬ ment should refer to the future and eternal state of anybody, because the whole testimony of Scripture is against that opinion. The second limitation is that, even supposing it did refer to the eternal state, and not to temporal evils, it has only reference to those who did the -wickedness of their fathers, and even then only to the third and fourth generations; because it says, " of them that hate mo." Moral character is therefore taken into account by the Divine Being in a case like fthat, even supposing it were possible to believe that it had reference to future and not to present evils. If I come to the New Testament, I find the most explicit declarations on this head. In Romans vi. 23,1 am told that " the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life." In Galatians iii. 10, I am told, "As many as are of the works of the law are under curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them." In verse 22 vvc read, "The Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe." In Romans i. 18 we read, " For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness." Then, of personal guilt again, 1'find in 2 Co¬ rinthians v. 10, " We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad." In Galatians vi. 7, 8, '• Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall 'he also reap. For he-that</page><page sequence="83">THIRD EVENING. 79 soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlast¬ ing." Now there are three things connected with the influence of sin upon us, both our own sin and the sins of others. We are conscious that we are exposed to the power of death, for we cannot suppose ourselves exempted from death, when all men die. The second thing is, we are conscious of conflicting elements— vice and virtue—in our minds. The worst man on earth has his good thoughts sometimes, and his strugglings with the evil within him, as if conscience, which is not dead, would assert her dignity and power, to a certain extent at least, even in a wicked man's mind. The third thing of which we are conscious is personal blame or praiseworthiness, in connexion with our actions. I never met with a man yet, who, deep down in his heart and conscience, supposed himself for a moment to be guilty of another's sin, whether Adam's or anybody else's. I come now at once to the consequences of sin, or the actual condition of the human family, as taught in the Scriptures, as affected by the sin of Adam. I believe, in the first place, that the body of man has become subject to death by reason of Adam's sin, though not exclusively by reason of that, but as com¬ bined with his own sin. Paul tells us, in the 5th chapter of his Epistle to the Romans, " By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." This is his view of the matter. I find again that we are subject to afflictions—many of which we inherit —we are born with them, and they are our inheritance, which it is both naturally and morally impossible that we should avoid. You will ask me here, upon what just principle we can be here held guilty for the sin of Adam, our first father. Let me make .two or three remarks, which may give a proximate answer to this inquiry. First, the original covenant with Adam was in itself just and good, and adapted to promote his best interests, whether it would ours or not. God could have done no better for him than the thing which he promised to do by the covenant he had made with him in regard to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In the second place, if each one of us had been separately placed in the same state of probation, we should have been just as liable, judging by the qualities of human nature, to fall as he; and, in all possibility, should have fallen. In the next place, if there had been a separate individual probation for mankind, there could have been no uniform standard of virtue; there could have been no true fellowship, no bond of obligation; there could have been no law of equality among men; there could</page><page sequence="84">8Q MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. have been no one law to guide and govern; no social or inter¬ national law; no common result arrived at by a moral course of conduct; consequently, there could have been no one heaven for the race at last. The head and representative was, as far as I understand his character, far more likely to stand for the many than the many for themselves, especially if all the circumstances be taken into account. He had the best possible natural powers. He had also direct intercourse with God to keep him alive to a sense of and knowledge of his duty. He had the most perfect natural physical enjoyment to render his position happy, and therefore to prevent tho entrance of discontent, dissatisfaction, and ingratitude. I remark again, that the plan of representa¬ tion adopted in the case of the first Adam failed through the nature of the man, rather than through the nature of the plan, as is evident from the fact that the representation of mankind by Jesus Christ the Saviour stands good by virtue of the person and character of Christ, rather than anything else. This ac¬ cords with the teaching of Paul, in the 8lh chapter of Romans. " What the law," he -says, " could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh : that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." The difference, therefore, between the representation of man by Christ and the represen¬ tation of man by Adam, does not arise out of any defect in the principle of representation itself, but out of the difference between the two persons occupying the two federal positions— namely, Adam and Christ. Iconoclast :—Mr. Chairman, no one can possibly take excep¬ tion to the calmness of the speech we have listened to. I admit that there is nothing whatever objectionable in its character, so- far as the quietude of its delivery is concerned; it does appear to me that the advantage to the listener might have been height¬ ened, if our friend had kindly supplied us with the meaning of a few of the words he used in the commencement of his speech. He has talked something about the cause of the sin, something about the details of the sin, something about the results of the sin, but I have not yet heard him tell us what he considered sin to be. I have listened all through his speech, and I have not heard an attempt to define original sin. The question we have for dis¬ cussion is thus worded: " Is the doctrine of original sin, as taught in the Bible, theoretically unjust and practically pernicious?" And, in directing my attention to that, I shall endeavour to show</page><page sequence="85">THIRD EVENING. 81 you that our friend has not stated to you the doctrine of original sin, as taught in the Bible ; next, to show you that original sin is of itself an absurdity; and next, to show you that the theory of original sin, as stated in the Scriptures, is theoretically unjust and practically pernicious. Now, what is the biblical theory of original sin As I under¬ stand it, it is this : that God made one man—our friend says he made him thoroughly perfect, but he forgot to quote any one text of Scripture verifying that; and, as we are discussing, not my friend's ideas, but the Bible-teaching this evening, I should be obliged by his telling me what verse of Scripture induces him to consider that Adam was made thoroughly perfect—what verse of Scripture induces him to think that Adam's state of holiness was complete when he was in the garden of Eden—what verse of Scripture induces him to think that in the garden of Eden man was surrounded with every perfection of physical, and after¬ wards of social advantages When he gives us those verses, we shall be able to examine them. At present, not having them, I" must give you my view. My view, then, is according to the Bible, that God placed one man, Adam, in a garden (and, as our friend does not go into the genealogy of the serpent, neither shall I go into the extent of the garden)—in a garden, to till it and tend it; that he placed there a tree, of which he well knew man could not help partaking of the fruit. And our friend admitted this, for what did he tell you He told you, if the tree had been absolutely injurious, there would have been no temptation to eat it; had it been even neutral, it is not likely the woman would have wanted to partake of it; and our friend, therefore, admitted that the tree was made with such characteristics as would induce those who saw it to wish and desire to partake of it. So that you have man, according to our friend, the repre¬ sentative of the human race—not elected by the human race, who are to share the consequences of his crime if he commits it; you have man in the garden, the representative of the human race, and placed near a tree that, according to our friend's own show¬ ing, was a tree he was likely to eat—a tree likely to induce him to desire to eat of it—with a command forbidding him to partake of it. Now, our friend says that man was perfect; I have challenged him to give me a text that will demonstrate this; but I will demonstrate, au contrarie, the absolute impossi¬ bility, even supposing he had such texts. Why, what has he told you He has told you this tree was a tree of knowledge— that man, in plucking of it and partaking of it, should know something after partaking of it which he did not know before the E 3</page><page sequence="86">82 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. repast commenced. But, surely, complete knowledge is neces¬ sary to perfection. If man is lacking in knowledge, man is not perfect: man was lacking in knowledge, because the partaking of the fruit of the tree gave him some knowledge he had not had. Full knowledge is necessary to perfection; man had not full knowledge, therefore man was not perfect; and our friend, even by his own statement of the case, has placed himself upon the horns of a dilemma. But to resume. What does our friend say He says, that although man was placed with a command ex¬ pressed that he should not partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, he thinks that there was also an implied command that he should not partake of the tree of life. [Mr. Barker :—No, no.] Our friend shakes his head at that; but the shake and his arguments are just of the same weight; and I will weigh them both—I will answer them both. If our friend did not mean that, what did his phrase mean at all If he did not mean that " at the very beginning it was implied that man should not par¬ take of the tree of life, then he should have left that portion of his speech out altogether, if it was not intended to convey to me the notion that when God planted the tree of life there, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil there, that at the same time he forbade him to partake of the one, he did not intend him to partake of the other; if my friend's speech was not intended to convey that, I was very unfortunate in listening to him, or he was not very clear in what he intended to convey. But, suppose God intended him to partake of it—for I suppose I am to presume that—what then Here, then, you have God all-wise, fore¬ knowing the consequences of his acts; you have God all-powerful, able to control all these circumstances; God all-good, desiring they shall tend to good; and you have man in the garden, with a tree near him which he must not partake of, which God foreknew before he created him that he would partake of, and that he could not help partaking of. But our friend has made it worse, for he has called in to his aid Satan, the enemy of both God and man. Can God have an enemy—God the infinite, God the all- powerful? Why, the very fact of there existing an enemy to God the infinite is at once an impeachment of his omnipotence; because God the all-powerful would at once put an end to this unseemly strife, and destroy his enemy. And when our friend tells you that he regards the serpent as the agent of the devil, I am obliged to meet him with the verse which says that the ser¬ pent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord Go&lt;i had made. Now, does he mean that God made the serpent</page><page sequence="87">THIRD EVENING. 83 or the devil If God made the serpent, did God make the devil's agent to do the devifs work Because, if so, you have God at the same time making man perfect and imperfect; you have God at the same time making the tempter, the temptation, the man to be tempted, and the damnation following the fall already planned out. But, if you have it that the devil created the serpent, then, my friends, theism is impeached: God is no longer the Creator of all things. And we are discussing the teachings contained in the Bible. The Bible says: " I the Lord create all things; I am the Lord, there is none beside me; I am God, there is no other God but me. I make peace; I create evil; I direct man's ways, his uprisings and his down-sittings." These are the distinct and the clear teachings of Scripture, and our friend has striven these positions in putting them before you. But follow them out a little. We have the temptation ; we have man falling; we have man punished ; and then our friend, if I understand him to mean anything, says that with the fall it does not necessarily follow that man's eternal happiness became endangered. So I under¬ stand him. [Mr. Barker :—No.] No; it appears again I am unlucky. I thought our friend strove to prove to you it was only man's temporal welfare— death, mortality, and disease—coming upon him; it may be again I was mistaken. I trust, then, our friend will take pity upon my misapprehension of his lucid description of what he meant, and put it before us in such a way that " he who runs may read," when he rises again. Not having been able to comprehend my friend, I shall have to take a track of my own instead of replying to him. I will put it plainly and fully what it seems to me is the Bible scheme. The Bible doctrine is this : God, knowing how to do better, did worse than he might have done; foreknowing the Consequences of his acts, he made man liable to fall at the first temptation—made the temptation, made the crime, made the cri¬ minal, and then brought a curse upon mankind because one matt had committed an offence he could not help committing. This is clearly the Bible doctrine, or else what becomes of your whole scheme of redemption If Adam did not drag everybody down with him, where is the need for the Redeemer The doctrine is, by Adam's sin death came into the world. I will read to you the words of the text, which are as explicit as anything can be, 1 Cor. xv. 21, 22 : " For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." And the doctrine is, that in the first man, Adam, all mankind became tainted, became depraved, became disfigured, fallen from their first estate; and that it needed</page><page sequence="88">84 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. a redemption, or Redeemer, to rescue them from the state into which they had fallen. Now, this is certainly the Bible doctrine, or else the whole of the teachers of the Bible have erred very much in their endeavours to deal with it; and, if it is not the Bible doctrine, I will challenge my friend to tell us precisely what it is, when he rises again. Now, let us examine the account of the fall, which my friend said he would not read to you, be¬ cause you were all well acquainted with it. The account of the fall represents God as creating man, and giving to him the fruit of every tree: God saw that all was very good. He gave to man " every herb-bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat." That God did when he created man—at least, so the Bible says. But then our friend knows the advan¬ tage of the Bible: you can quote everything and anything from it. Our friend felt this, for he quoted from the 18th Ezekiel verses which suited his purpose—and, by the way, he did not quote the strongest which he might have done ; he might have read from the 18th Ezekiel these expressive words: "The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son ;" but he knew that the other text to which he had referred, the corresponding text in the 21st chapter of Exodus, in terms precisely, and in terms contradictory, says that the son should bear the iniquity of the father, unto the third and fourth generation. Our friend knows, then, that he has a book which will bear out probably any view of the question which he may choose to take. But, if it does that, what then He is reduced to this dilemma, that the whole thing becomes absurdly contradictory to reason; and to require a belief in it is not only theoretically unjust, but practically pernicious, because it is degrading the human mind, and debasing it. Now, God gives to man the fruit of every tree—so says the Bible; but he does not—so says the Bible also. God gives to man the fruit of every tree—no, he does not. " Of the fruit of the tree of good and evil thou shalt not eat." Our friend passed over very much of the nature of the fruit. He told us there were some who thought that the tree of life was designed to sustain immortality in man. Does he believe in a literal tree of life Not one word of figurative to-night—all literal. We have a literal tree of the knowledge of good and evil; we have a literal tree of life. Why, if one of your congregation, sir, came to you and told you he was trying to find out the species to which the tree of life belonged, what would you say to him If he told you he was going on a voyage of discovery to get a graft from the tree of</page><page sequence="89">THIRD EVENING. 85 knowledge of good and evil, would not you regard him as insane I ask you, do you candidly and honestly believe this was intended to represent literal occurrences at all You have talked in this debate of figurative matters. Take it for a moment that they were literal—that it was a tree which gave to the partaker a knowledge of good and a knowledge of evil—then I say it was theoretically unjust to condemn man for plucking of the tree of knowledge. What higher duty can man have than to become more wise, more true, more honest, more manly ?—and, unless he knows, how can he do this The ignorant man is a slave; the ignorant man is weak; the ignorant man is down-trodden; and our friend here to-night has to defend a system theoretically unjust and practically pernicious, which in every age of the world has made the pluck¬ ing of the tree of knowledge of good and evil a crime, and visited with excommunication the men who have dared to do it. I But our friend did not try to define sin to you. Let us see ' whether the act can be sin. One writer, Samuel Taylor Cole¬ ridge, in his " Aids to Reflection," on, I think, the 195th page, Bays, " A sin is an evil which has its ground or origin in the agent, and not in the compulsion of circumstances.'' Circum¬ stances are compulsory from the absence of a power to resist or control them; and if this absence likewise be the effect of cir- j cumstances, that is, if it have been neither directly nor indirectly caused by the agent himself, the evil derives from the circum¬ stances ; and, therefore, such evil is not sin, and the person who t suffers it, or is the compelled instrument of its infliction on I others, may feel regret, but not remorse. Now, let us consider ; for a moment whether this sin did originate in this way, entirely ' free fiom circumstances. Our friend says, no; for what did he tell you He told you the sin was in the nature of Adam, and not | in the nature of the plan. But who gave Adam his nature— j, God! Our friend says, first, that Adam's nature was perfect, j* and then he says the disposition to sin was natural in him. Now, '' can two statements be more entirely absurd and contradictory &gt; than these The very phrase, original sin, is a pleonasm. Sin t must be original—originated entirely independent of circum¬ stances extrinsic to the^vill. Now, can there be sin I say, no. If there be God—if God have will, God's will is infinite; there can be no will outside, beyond, or above God's will; no will but God's will. Well, if there be no second will to God's will, there can be no will of man opposed to that will, out of that will. If God's will be omnipotent, man's will cannot countervail against the omnipotent will of God, and you cannot have sin. But suppose, for a moment, the possibility of it, then have you sin in «*«&amp;.&gt;-^Jv-stsfKsa</page><page sequence="90">86 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. this case? I will show you, no. What are the facts of the case? A tree, our friend admits, good for food ; our friend admits, pleasant to the eyes; " a tree to be desired," in the words of the text, " to make one wise." God had baited his trap most cunningly for unfortunate human kind to fall into; no loophole left; they are driven to it spite of themselves. According to our friend's own case: lest man should have avoided the dangers; lest by any possibility he should not have plucked this tempting fruit, God makes a devil, the enemy of himself and man—man, unwitting of this foe whom God has made, if he be the Creator of all things, and whom, if he has not made, he is not God: this foe pushes him into the trap which God has made to tempt him to destruction. This is practically pernicious; this is theo¬ retically unjust. Instead of teaching men that by their first representative they were all dragged down; instead of teaching mankiud that by their first father they were all tainted ; instead of teaching them that they are naturally depraved; instead of teach¬ ing them that their intent is evil; rather teach mankind this—theo¬ retically more pure and practically more useful—teach mankind that the elements of good are in them without a fall, despite all fall; that they may themselves develop them; and that the only redemption the people want is their own redemption, not by faith, but by work, that mightiest worship which makes man himself above all creeds and churches—above the petty dogmas of original sin. But who is this devil? Pharaoh said, " Who is the Lord ?" I will say, "Who is Satan?" Our friend says, the enemy of God and man. How does he know Chapter and verse I want. He could not have been very much of an enemy, when he was permitted to come with God's family, on particular occasions when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord. There were no words of enmity between God and Satan when he asked him where he came from, and Satan said he came from walking up and down in the world, and going backwards and forwards in it. Nay, they are so much alike, the Bible itself makes a mistake in speaking of them; and where in one case it is put that the Lord caused David to do a certain thing, in another case it is put that Satan did it. I do not know, they may be the same. I have heard that no being is sometimes so much his enemy as himself, and it may be that our friend will reduce them to one. If he does not, he is in this dilemma— either God is infinite, or he is not. If he is infinite, his infinite omnipotence precludes all enmity to him—precludes all evil. Besides, this devil, this evil one, does he come from God, or does</page><page sequence="91">THIBD EVENING. 87 he exist in spite of God Is he eternal too—is the devil eternal— are there two eternals Then tell me which is the most power¬ ful, God or Satan—the one who spoils the other's handiwork ?— because you tell me God made man perfect, and the devil made him imperfect. Is he more powerful than God, spoiling God's work This is our friend's case, not mine. I know nothing about the devil; I confess it at once, frankly and candidly. If he can tell us, I shall be glad to hear; it will be knowledge to me. But let us see what happens. He says that the devil misled the woman, and tried to insinuate evil to her. Let us see, supposing the serpent was the devil, what happened. The serpent said, " Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of every tree of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die : for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then shall your eyes be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." Now, what is the fact The fact is that God endorses the devil's words; for when man has eaten of the fruit of the tree, God, who is by himself, says to the other gods who are not with him, " Behold, the man is become as one of us, knowing good and evil." Now, more than this, God said, before the fruit of the tree was plucked, " In the day thou shalt eat thereof, thou shalt surely die." Those are the words of the 2nd chapter and of the 17th verse; and I ask my friend whether it is not only not true that Adam died in the day that he ate thereof, but whether it is not the fact he lived hundreds of years afterwards, and had sons and daughters after he plucked the fruit of it So that, instead of its being the devil who lied, it was God, who said that which was not correct. I won't use the term " lying " on this side, because my friend will probably find us the proper phrase for it, and until he does I leave it with him. Then what have you in this doctrine of original sin You have the foundation of your whole Christian system ; you have the groundwork of your whole scheme of Christianity. If the doctrine of original sin be not true, then the whole of Christianity is false. If it is not true that Adam sinned, then it is not true that Christ redeemed you from the consequences of Adam's sin; and I will put this position for our friend's consideration. All that we can judge of, all that we can take cognizance of, we must take cognizance of under what we term the form of cause and effect, each effect being itself the cause of that it precedes, and</page><page sequence="92">88 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. cause being itself the effect of the causative influence which preceded it; and in this existence, this nature, if I may so phrase it, you cannot imagine origin, you can only imagine a succession of effects and causes. But sin, to be sin, must be original; it must be original, therefore you cannot have sin naturally. The state must be originated, but you cannot conceive an origin in nature, because you cannot conceive any effect uncaused ; cause and effect—the constitution of your mind compels you so to accept this, and what we call nature is a continuous line or chain of causes and effects, all linked together, the furthermost lost in the remote past—go back, and still it is beyond us. Then I submit to you, that as sin to be sin must be originated in the will of the actor, and as it is impossible to imagine any act originant in the will of the actor, independent of circumstances external to the will, that sin itself is not natural; that therefore Adam could not have committed sin, and that therefore through Adam's sin all mankind cannot have been tainted with natural depravity; that therefore Christ did not come to redeem men from their fallen state; that therefore the whole scheme of Christianity is a sham and a delusion upon you. I will leave this in a few more words. Is it theoretically unjust ?—is it practically pernicious Theoretically unjust! What mother here, taking her little baby into her arms, will tell you, looking into its laughing eyes, that she believes that that child is born into the world stamped by God with the curse of original sin upon it? Not one. The mother's maternal love, her humanity, is stronger than her creed; it rebels against it; and I ask you here to-night to let your humanity have full play; I appeal to you against your faith; I appeal to jou against your religion; and I tell you that this doctrine, which would represent man brought into the world tainted with the fall, damned for the sin committed by his fore¬ father, a representative whom he did not choose—I say that this doctrine is theoretically unjust, practically pernicious, for it saps the foundations of human aspirations; and instead of teaching human kind that the tree—the source of all their intellect, of all their knowledge, of all their beauty—forms a pure fountain, tells them that the stream comes tainted from its source with a passionate curse direct from God. I say humanity revolts and rebels against that doctrine. Mr. Barkee :—I may be of course deluding myself, but I cannot see that any of the arguments which I used in the opening speech have been answered. We have had a great deal said about what can and what cannot be, but we have not had</page><page sequence="93">THIRD EVENING. 89 an attempt clearly and logically to show why man, who, while I spoke of him as perfect in his nature, was but a finite creature, could not be in a position to sin. We have heard a great deal about absolute perfection. Still I hold that absolute perfection belongs only to God, with regard to all the powers of the Divine mind. There is only one will absolute, but it does not follow that that absolute will cannot be in a position to allow a finite and subordinate will a sphere of action of its own, in which it may be, in a sort of secondary sense, absolute, though not beyond that sphere. And such was the position in which God placed our first parents. If he had placed them in Paradise in such a position that they could not, either physically .or in any other sense, have touched the tree of knowledge of good and evil, why then they would have been just nothing but mere machines. And according to the definition which he has read, and promised to comment upon (but I could not see the comment myself), from Taylor Coleridge, I should say that Coleridge is dead against him. If I had his book in my hand now, I would try to show that, sentence by sentence, and part by part of each sentence, as I went on ; for, if I mistake not, he quotes from Coleridge to this effect, that that which is sin must necessarily originate in the will of the agent. I think that is the meaning of Coleridge. That is all we contend for. We contend that there is no sin, either on man's part or on the part of any other intelligent creature, which does not involve freedom of agency and freedom of action on the part of that creature. And if our mother Eve had been physically incapable, or in any other sense absolutely incapable, of partaking of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, there would have been no virtue in letting it alone; and no sin in touching it, if she had been compelled to touch it. But to be only persuaded to touch is another thing, and is perfectly consistent with the freedom of one's own agency, and this is all we contend for. As regards the influence of the tempter, I said distinctly, in my opening speech, a temptation was of such a nature as not necessarily to involve a second moral agent to act upon you, but might arise out of your own thoughts and own desires, and be occasioned, not caused, by things perfectly inno¬ cent in themselves. Now the mind of God is in all respects, we say, perfect and absolute; but the mind of the creature cannot be in the same sense perfect, though it is periect in its kind. But to suppose that it is incapable of any change, is to invest it with immutability; for a thing to be immutable, it must be infinite, and to be infinite, it must be eternal and unchangeable as God himself is. And so, therefore, you cannot have a distinction—</page><page sequence="94">90 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. which I believe humanity has managed somehow or other always to keep up with more or less distinctness and clearness—you cannot have a distinction between vice and virtue unless you invest the creature, intelligent and moral, with powers which enable him to act according to his own will, even though there may be laws to the contrary. Well, now let us suppose God's absolute power, which my opponent says is so thoroughly inconsistent with the doctrine of the fall, had been brought to bear on this case. There is but one of two ways in which God could prevent it—either by bring¬ ing special influences to dissuade them from the plucking—and I could show you why that was not done, if it were required—or else pure physical force, to prevent them plucking of the fruit. Now, in order to do the latter, he must have either held man in chains, so to speak, to prevent his acting, or he must have destroyed the powers of the mind, one by one, which allied themselves to that object which was the occasion of their transgression and trespass against him. For God to impede the progress of evil in this way, while it might have been consistent with the exercise of Almighty power, would have been inconsistent with the manifes¬ tation of infinite wisdom, and with the manifestation of infinite goodness, if there can be any sense whatsoever in which evil, though not caused by God, can bo overruled and managed by God, so that, in the end, it shall tend to the ultimate good of the intelligent universe, as a whole. Now, with regard to the tree of knowledge of good and evil. I say that it was a literal tree, most undoubtedly ; and so, with regard to the tree of life, I say there was a literal tree; but I do not say what my friend sup¬ posed, that they might not touch the tree of life. 1 say they did touch the tree of life; and some divines have thought it was the actual means of preserving them in their immortal condition. I do not say that. I think it was the symbol, and nothing more. Grod had invested man with sentient, intelligent, and moral life; and in order that man might know whether his moral life was in full plaj'—whether towards God he was what he ought to be in his will and feelings—be must have some means of testing those feelings. There was but one means by which he could test those feelings, and that means God embodied in tho tree of knowledge of good and evil. So long as man had the resolution to abstain from that tree, which, apart from any Divine com¬ mand concerning it, was not a tree at all undesirable; so long as he had the moral power to abstain from this lesser good for the sake of the higher good ; so long he was exorcising the freedom of an agent responsible to God, and had an infallible test in his</page><page sequence="95">"THIRD EVESOTG. 91 own mind of the virtuous condition of his feelings, and also a test of his aeoeptableness in the sight of God, on the ground of the perfectness of his own obedience. The trees were put into the garden for that purpose—the one purely as a privilege, being the symbol of an inner life ; and the other the law of that life. Now mark the simplicity of that law ; for a great deal is said of " impeaching the goodness and justice of God in putting that tree in the garden." Mark the simplicity and goodness of it. Apart from such a trial, man could never have had any life higher than a mere sentient and intellectual life. It is utterly impossible, in the very natuie of things, for there to be moral life without a moral law. You may have sentient life, and man had that sentient life when God put him in the broad earth, before he said anything to him about a garden or about its fruits. He had all the instincts, all the powers of a perfect body, with all its desires exquisitely alive and active, quite as much so as ours are, but not perverted in their direction or actions ; but he could not have attained a higher than that sentient and instinctive life, unless he had given to him a rule by which he could test his actions as a moral and responsible being ; and the simplest pos¬ sible rule was given to him. It did not consist of a complicated law, like that afterwards given on Sinai, having ten command¬ ments directed specifically against those irregular feelings and propensities in man's nature, one by one, until the whole circle of evil, which had generated and grown up in man's heart, should be brought under its influence and under its control; but simply a negative requirement—do not touch that tree : and so long as, amidst all the beauties and excellencies of Paradise, you are enabled to refuse that simple thing, which you do not need (for if they had been in a condition of want, it would have been quite another thing, but they had plenty to make them perfectly happy), you have an infallible sign in your own conscience that you prefer my will to your own pleasure ; that you allow my will to be absolute, while I acknowledge 3-ours to have a finite consistent sphere of action of its own—under a law which my will gives only for your good, as included in and connected with my glory. I do not see that there is anything to answer at all about God not being able to have an enemy. You might say an elephant could not be bitten by a flea just as well. The fact is, it is not at all a question affecting the Divine power. That Divine power we admit, and we believe it to be such that God could crush these tiny, puny enemies of his at any moment, if he pleased ; and if it were only a question of power, it would be done forthwith in the case of fallen angels and fallen men,</page><page sequence="96">92 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. too. But inasmuch as that power is not mere physical force, but is under the influence of Divine intelligence—of the most perfect wisdom and benevolence also—God bears with these his enemies ; and that is not all—he does that which, in the nature of things, consistently with their moral agency, can be done for their moral improvement; for the amelioration of their self-imposed condition of difficulty and danger, in order that they may come up out of it, and realize at last, in a sense my friend does not seem to under¬ stand, that that old tree was the " tree of knowledge of good and evil"—in a sense which nothing but redemption itself can ultimately realize and unfold. I have one or two more propositions which I must lay down before this meeting, with regard to this question of the righteous¬ ness and equity of our being represented by one whom we did not ask to represent us, and all that sort of stuff; because the question, whether we asked to be represented or not, is a question which does not touch the argument in its main features—it may sideway touch it, but that is all. We say, one general head and representative for the human race was more likely to stand for the many, than the many were to stand for themselves, one by one. Now, take Adam as a natural father, to begin with. All men were to spring from him in a direct line; and the mere fact, for instance, of his being the natural progenitor of the race, necessarily invested his character with a degree of influence and power over his offspring. If, therefore, his offspring, one by one, each child after his father, &amp;c, had been under a moral obligation to obey the same law which the original man was called upon to obey, then there could not have been that which was perfectly righteous and consistent in the arrangement, because there would have been wanting the representative principle which, when viewed in all its bearings, removes the difficulty which would be connected with that side of the case. If Adam had not been placed in a position to represent us before God, we should have suffered just as much, probably, from what he did as we have suffered; for I have shown from the beginning that no soul is damned for anybody else's sin but its own. I do not say that no soul was exposed to damnation by Adam's sin, but was not damned for Adam's sin ; and I showed how far that sin influences us, and how far it does not. And I am perfectly con¬ sistent in my view with some of the highest and best scholars of the Christian church, if I had time to quote their writings." Here the Umpire called " Time."</page><page sequence="97">THIRD EVENING. 93 Iconoclast :—My friend's notion of calm argument and of quiet discussion, and mv own, do not quite accord. I am not sure that " all that sort of stuff" will be the best answer to the propositions we may put to one another; and the only thing which relieves my mind in the doubt is, that I am dealing with a gentleman who, at any rate, commands figures of speech so grandly beautiful—so thoroughly and sublimely illustrating his subject—that I can admire, without hoping, even humbly, to imitate. AVho would have thought of comparing God and the devil to an elephant and a flea? I admit that the illustra¬ tion is unanswerable, whatever force it may have.—(A Voice :— Stuff.)—Stuff! Yes, you have put it right, Sir. Having got rid of all that " stuff," then, we will proceed to the debate. Our friend has not told you the text in Genesis which induced him to consider that man was made in a state of perfection and holi¬ ness, which he maintained in his first speech. He has carefully avoided quoting Scripture upon it. He has told us that man was made with great desires and appetites, and with everything ne¬ cessary to gratify them. Will he be kind enough to find me chapter and verse for that He has said that man did eat of the tree of life. Will he be kind enough to find me chapter and verse for that I do not say he won't; but, if he does not in his next speech, I shall be apt to think he cannot, when I come to reply again. And our friend should remember, that he who has in¬ vited a calm consideration of a subject, should not complain of having left his own entrenchments. I follow him, and adopt the same style of warfare which he sets me an example of. Now, he has not told us anything about the text of Scripture which induced him to think that the devil was an enemy of God. It is the Bible view he has to put before us, and he should be able to quote chapter and verse for his statements about it. He says he has not to do with the question, whether omnipotent God can or cannot have enemies, Why, then, did he invite the logical discussion of it at all Because, surely, that is one of the first positions that could be put to him. He says I have not answered what he says; but, if these points are dealt with, they cut at the root of all he has said. I therefore put it to him that he must answer it; and when he tells you that God could crush this insignificant enemy as easily as you could crush the puniest thing, I ask him, if that be true, why God did not crush this enemy before the creation of man, instead of leaving him to drag millions of men into hell, from which they might otherwise have escaped? But, my friend undertakes to explain to us by-and-by why it was that God did not do certain things. Now, I am glad</page><page sequence="98">94 MODERN atheism and the bible. he is able to do it, and I shall wait with much interest till he does. But, in the meantime, I shall have to take exception to what he does say about God. He says, that there are only two ways in which God could have prevented man from eating of the fruit of the tree—one is by direct physical force, and another is by inter¬ fering in some other way between him and the tree, and pre¬ venting him eating the fruit. Let me suggest a third: God was the creator, and he might most effectually have prevented the eating of the tree by not creating it at all. That is a course which my friend left out; and it seems to me it would have been the most effective course, and one which the All-wise and the All-good and the All-perfect God could, if he pleased, have pursued without any reflection upon his dignity at all. Let us see. Our friend says there could be no national treaties, no social regulations, and no intercourse between man and man—that every¬ thing depended upon the fact of Adam having ate the fruit of this tree, which Eve had placed before him. Is it so? Yes ; our friend says there could have been no moral law without it. You might have been sentient, you might have had instinct, but you never would have had conceptions of moral law but for this. Let him tell me what moral lesson he draws from it at all. He says, he accepts Samuel Taylor Coleridge's definition of sin, and that it goes against me, or that it might, if he had the book. Let us see what is Samuel Taylor Coleridge's definition. It is, that " sin must be a state originant in the will of the actor, entirely independent of circumstances extrinsic of that will." Why, the " tree good for food " was a circumstance extrinsic to the will of man to tempt him. The devil, arch-enemy of God and man, was a circumstance extrinsic to the will to tempt man. So that, if my friend accept Samuel Taylor Coleridge's definition of sin, then Adam did not sin, because there were abounding circum¬ stances to tempt him to fall. Then, our friend says, Adam could not be absolutely perfect, but he was as perfect as he could be. But what kind of perfection have you A perfection that is so slight that it falls with the first temptation; it gives way at the first trial. Then the doctrine of personal representation is re¬ ferred to. Our friend would make a good one to justify the present House of Commons representation, or any other. He considers that the man's consent to the person who shall repre¬ sent him is not requisite at all. You, who are to suffer from the conduct of your representative, are to have no part in electing him.. He is elected without your consent, commits acts without your concurrence, and you are to suffer the penalty for those aets</page><page sequence="99">THIRD EVENING. 95 in which you have no share. But, my friend says, you are not to be damned; you are only to be exposed to damnation. I should like to know the difference. Is seems very much like a distinc¬ tion without a difference. Either men are liable to damnation for Adam's sin, or they are not. If they are not, then there was no need for redemption from consequences to which man is not liable. If they are, then my whole argument remains precisely in the condition in which I put it to you. Now, how much has our friend remedied matters by the course he has taken He says the trees are literal—the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Does he believe they are existing now Yes, or no. If not, does he not consider that trees of knowledge are as necessary in the present day as they were in the time of Adam—-Adam, made more perfect than we are, having access to things necessary for enjoyment, which many of you know you have not And yet, Adam had the trees of knowledge and of life, of which latter, if he had eaten little bits daily, he might have continued to live for ever Why, you mock me, and mock yourself, for this very book teaches us that if man plucked from the tree of knowledge of good and evil—-if he took of it and ate, he should live for ever; how, then, should my friend put it that this tree of life, which you keep taking meals of, and getting an additional bit of life each time you take of it? The thing is absurdly ridiculous and supremely contemptible; and I regret that, while you are dealing with this, you do not rise above it, and let us see whether there bo something hidden be¬ neath it. If you mean to tell me that this is literal—that the serpent did come and talk to the woman—that the serpent was the agent of the devil—that he induced woman, weak and pliable, to partake of the fruit of the tree, and to get her husband to eat of it—if you mean to tell me that this sublime farce was played out, and all human kind was exposed to damnation in conse¬ quence—then I contend that this story is theoretically unjust and practically pernicious, and that atheism, to such an account as that, is virtue in any man, whoever he is. A tree of knowledge— a literal tree—the plucking of the fruit, and the eating it, and getting some knowledge thereby, that a man should be damned for it—where are the moral lessons from such a story If it teaches anything, it teaches that you must not try to know any¬ thing—that you must keep from plucking knowledge—that you must be ignorant—that you must shut your eyes—that you may believe—but must never think, reason, grasp. Never pluck from the tree of knowledge! Was there ever a tree of knowledge Yes, there is one, and only one—a mighty tree—a tree whose</page><page sequence="100">96 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. roots are everywhere, whose branches are everywhere—which opens out a store of truth in every land, in every age, in every page of history; and I say, it is not only no crime to pluck it, but it is high treason and lese majesty against humanity to leave it, not plucking it, when it lies there. Our friend says that man was responsible to God. Will he be kind enough to give me chapter and verse which makes Adam responsible to God Will he be kind enough to tell me, having done that, whether the punishment of Adam was sufficient or insufficient for Adam's offence If it was sufficient, then it was unjust that all who came after him should have to share that which was a sufficient punish¬ ment, and suffer for that which had received a sufficient punish¬ ment. And, if it was insufficient, then it was unjust; for God acted unfairly in portioning out less punishment to Adam than he deserved, and giving to others more than they ought to have borne at all. But let us see. Our friend says, you are only exposed to damnation. What does that mean If you believe, you will be saved; if you don't believe, you will be damned. And you are exposed to damnation, then, for just the same reason that Adam was then. If you pluck of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, you won't be able to believe, and then you will incur damnation; while if you are only desiring, and don't pluck, you are only exposed to it; and that is the pleasant state our friend puts before you. If he means anything else, I shall be glad to hear it when he rises again; and I shall now pursue for a moment the course of argument which seems to lie upon all this. Our friend was here to discuss the doctrine of original sin, as taught in the Bible. I want to know where in the Bible it is taught that man was made perfect Where is it taught that man's desires were as keen as ours to-day—men's appetite for knowledge as strong, and the means for gratifying these things in any way complete I want to know where he learns about the serpent being the agent of the devil—where he knows anything from texts of Scripture about the devil being the enemy of God I want these things ex¬ plained ; and I ask him, if these be true—if the talking serpent be literal, if the tree be literal, if all be literal—how he can con¬ tend that any part of the Bible is figurative If these be literal, then all figure is gone at once. Was the serpent on his head, tail, or back, when he was condemned to crawl on his belly In what language was the sentence spoken Hebrew, Greek, Spanish, high Dutch, or what language was it spoken in You may toll me these things are of no consequence. You may tell me that they matter not. I tell you they do. It is our</page><page sequence="101">THIRD EVENING. 97 friend's belief I challenge; and, when you hiss, I tell you this, that in this debate, hiss as you will, each hiss marks a crevice in your rotten creed. The "Umpire called " Time." Mr. Barker :—Now for this much desired text out of Genesis, to begin with. AVe are told in the 1st chapter of the book of Genesis, and the 27th verse, that " God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them." Now, if that is not like making a man per¬ fect, I should like to know what is. The good man supposes that I cannot find passages in Genesis—at least, he did not say I could not, but that if I did he did not know what he would do to me—which show that wo might eat of the fruit of the tree of life; mark you, not tho tree of knowledge, for there is no such tree, but the tree of knowledge of good and evil. He has been discussing about the tree of knowledge, and telling you how desirable the tree of knowledge is. I know that the tree of knowledge is desirable, but not the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Get as much knowledge as you can, but with as little evil attached to it as possible. And now for the other text: " And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil." The tree of life for food as well as the rest, and the other tree, for food; but with regard to that one tree—all the rest Adam might eat of—but of that one tree—the tree of know¬ ledge of good and evil—he might not eat. Now I will give you some texts from the New Testament upon the same subject; because, if the book of Genesis be dark and enigmatical, if there be a question whether they be figurative or literal, there are passages in the New Testament which probably will throw light upon the enigma, and make it altogether plain. In Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians you will see what perhaps we may use on our side of the argument with some advantage. We read in Ephesians iv. 24, "And that ye put on the new man, which after God is renewed in righteousness and true holiness." Now compare that with Colossians iii. 10, " And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him." So that knowledge, and righteousness, and holiness constitute the new man—the restored image of God is man created by Jesus Christ; ergo, the image lost must have had the same properties, or this cannot be a restored image. We are F</page><page sequence="102">98 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. told that God might have prevented the eating of tho tree by not creating it, but if that identical tree had not been created my argument still holds good, that without some such tree—a tree having such use—you never could have had a moral law, or a moral life, and there never could have been a distinction between virtue and vice. I say that man, the creature, never could have arrived at the knowledge of the distinction between these two things, either as a matter of theory or as a matter of experience; for, without a law to guide and direct his thoughts and feelings as a moral being, all his actions would have been merely indifferent, and therefore neither vicious nor virtuous; so that he never could have enjoyed the favour of God; in point of fact, he could have had no relation to God any more than the brutes which crouch at his feet, which are simply creatures made by the will of God, and dying under the same circumstances at the proper time. And now we will go a little further in our argument, notwith¬ standing what our friend has said. He said there would be no need of redemption but for Adam's sin. I deny it. Even if Adam's sin had no influence upon us—if he had sinned only for himself, and then you and I had sinned for ourselves—the re¬ demption would have been quite as necessary as it is now. Whether the sin of Adam has had an influence upon us or not, I still remind him I have never said that a soul can be damned for it. I do not believe that the Scriptures teach it. A man is damned only for his own sins. So long, therefore, as you do sin individually, the redemption of Christ is found as necessary as if there never had been such a man as Adam under the sun, and as if you had no connexion with him. Deny all sin, and we know what you are about; but admit the existence of sin and its effects, present or future—it does not matter which—and then there is a necessity for a redemption that shall so far repair the evil as you agree to admit that the evil exists. So that that is not good logic. I shall finish my speech this evening by two or three remarks, by which I hope to illustrate what appears to my mind the justice and propriety, on God's part, of entering into such a re¬ presentative arrangement with Adam. For though it entails upon us, in the present stage of things, sentence of death, and that which we agree to call original sin and depravity of nature, yet still there was parallel with this, in the Divine mind, tho work of redemption by representation. You must have the one if you are to have the other ; and I will try and illustrate it. First, as to the possibility of God's forming, in the first</page><page sequence="103">THIED EVENING. 99 instance, a correct estimate of human character. I have a tree in my garden, I will suppose, that has never yet borne fruit, and therefore I do not know what the fruit will be; but this next Summer it shall be full of fruit. I wish to ascertain all I can chemically of the properties of that fruit. Need I then take the whole yield of the tree and subject it to a chemical analysis to know what its nature is? If I take a good, full, fair, ripe specimen from the tree and subject it to a chemical analysis, I have as certain a result as if I analysed the whole fruit. So far then, as the possibility of forming an estimate of the moral character of human nature from one representative is concerned, it is perfectly easy and legitimate. As to the rectitude of such a course, I hold that, if man had not been representatively con¬ nected with Adam, although he is fallen, and in some respects injured thereby, morally and spiritually, it would have been im¬ possible for him to have been representatively connected with Jesus Christ. If the Lord Jesus Christ were to interpose in the behalf of one of the fallen angels to redeem that angel, that redemption would, of necessity, be confined to that angel, because there is nothing representatively in common between the angels who have sinned—no federal connexion—no' headship of the description which exists between Adam and his posterity. And so, if men had been distinct from one another, and had fallen as distinct persons, then, though some men might have stood and never fallen, yet all who had fallen must have remained there, and could not have been by a redemption brought nigh to God&gt;- unless that redemption had been brought by so many separate acts of representation on the part of him who undertook to redeem them. Whereas now, the simple fact of Christ taking humanity upon him, allies him to the whole race; and, in the first instance, secures the salvation of all infants in heathen lands, and all lands ; and, in the next place, secures the salvation' of all the imbecile and idiotic of our race everywhere, in all- time, and uuder all circumstances; and, in the third place, puts a free and full salvation, without money and without price, into the possession, or rather within the reach, of every man who hears the Gospel—and puts the possessor of that salvation, as far as by faith he becomes interested in the plan, in possession of a life better, higher, grander, more perfect, than that which he has lost by the fall. For Christ says, " I am come that they migth have life, and that they might have it more abundantly." Per¬ haps we may be told there is no such text as that, but it happens to be in the 10th chapter of John. This is the light then in which this subject appears to me. I F 2</page><page sequence="104">100 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. say he is wrong in asserting that original sin is the cause of redemption. No, no; but the precise mode in which the sin was permitted to propagate itself was with a distinct eye to the redemption. And the reason, in all probability, as it appears to my mind—and I think I am sustained in it by the Scriptures, if I had time for the full discussion of this matter, which cannot be dor.o in a quarter of an hour's speech—the reason for the great distinction between the fallen angels being lost without redemp¬ tion, and the fact of a redemption being provided for man, simply is, that there is the federal principle of connexion among the human race by which the one act of Christ, becoming incarnate, puts him in a position to reach and touch all tho race of man; whereas, if they had sinned and fallen individually, he could only have benefited them one by one by so many separate manifesta¬ tions of his mercy and saving power. If, then, there be any principles of a moral, metaphysical, or philosophical character, that are worth the thought of a man seeking after knowledge, I hold, after all, that the old tree of knowledge of good and evil— in its negative, in its positive, in its past, and in its future—lays the foundation for tho highest development of man's intellectual, moral, and spiritual faculties before God; and the fact of his redemption, as I hope to show when I come to that subject, lays a foundation for a life far, very far surpassing the highest moral life that man could ever attain to by his own acts of obedience to the law of God, however complete, universal, and perfect those acts might be. I say, sirs, in your presence to-night—and I cannot leave this place without saying it—for while I have the greatest possible esteem for my friend on the other side of the table, I have the greatest personal sorrow in my soul on his account when I am not here ; I must say it, because it is perfectly ingenuous and sincere on my part. I have every reason to believe that he is an honest doubter in this matter; I would not have met him if I had not thought it of him ; but I do wish that, instead of appeal¬ ing from time to time to our passions, he would reason upon some fair principles which might be admitted on both sides. I know that he does not think the principles unfair on which he reasons; but they do appear so to my mind, and mine, perhaps, appear so to his, and that is the chief reason why we arrive at such diffcient conclusions in regard to matters of such vital interest. But confident am I in this, that there is nothing in the religion of God that can injure man, either for time or for eternity. There is nothing in the doctrine of the fall that was intended by God to injure men. Sin is altogether the act of the</page><page sequence="105">THIRD EVENING. 101 creature, as I showed in my first speech, inasmuch as it could be either with or without a tempter. I have not complicated my case by virtually adopting, though I could not of course remember, the exact words of Samuel Taylor Coleridge in regard to sin—I say, all temptation is a mere circumstance, which, when it arrives at the will, has no power to coerce the will, and the man is solely responsible for the act which he voluntarily performs in all cases of a moral nature. The Umpire called " Time." Iconoclast :—My friend and myself have mutual sorrows— the one for the other. My sorrow is either that he does not know the Scriptures he is here to defend, or that, knowing them, he will not take some trouble to quote them. He says that man had touched of the tree of life, and he has not ventured to read to you any text which says that man did so. I say that my friend has brain enough for what he said, and skill enough to avoid defending it. Our friend has not read to you the texts which say that the serpent was the agent of the devil; nor has he read the texts which say that the devil was the enemy of God and man ; nor has he read the texts which say that man had as keen appetites and desires then as at the present time, and every¬ thing necessary for the gratification of them. I say that there were round phrases of speech used by my friend not in the text. Even the very last text, which he wound up by saying I should perhaps say was not there—though he had better have waited till I said so—-the text which he says asserts of Jesus that he came to bring life to human kind, and to bring it more abun¬ dantly, is not where he says it is. In the 10th chapter of John you will find nothing of it. You will find this, which is the nearest I can get to it—" My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." I am not sure that it is not there, but— [Me. Barker :—Turn to the 10th verse.]—I admit that I am entirely wrong—frankly and at once. The precise words are in the 10th verse, and I had entirely overlooked them. Now, if our friend would do what I have set him an example of doing, it would save him a great deal of trouble. And now, having admitted I was wrong, I will say he is. This text does not say that Jesus came to bring this life to human kind, but to his sheep. And who are they He defines those who were his sheep as those who believed in his word.</page><page sequence="106">102 modern atheism and the bible. Our friend says he brought salvation to the heathen, the imbecile, the idiotic. Do they believe in him Then this is an imbecile, an idiotic, a heathen faith. Jesus says, " He that believeth not on me is condemned already." " He that believeth on me and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall bo damned." It is the faith which constitutes the sheep—the belief which constitutes the life, and the belief alone. Passing for a moment to the positions which I laid down, it seems to me that they are all untouched. The whole of the questions which our friend should have connected with the account of the fall, it seems to me, he has left entirely out; and we must therefore take it that, so far as my case has gone, my representation is to be taken as correct. What is his argument That temptation was of none effect—that it did not control tho will. Where is this, from one end of the Bible to the other If temptation did not control the will, it was no temptation— the whole thing was a farce, and the introduction of the devil stands for nothing. Our friend says, that when the temptation came to the will it did not affect it, and he wound up by telling you something about the will alone being responsible. What did that mean All I know of will is, that it is a mental state, the result of circumstances differing from each other, and differ¬ ing not only on each occasion, but in the proceeding of each action following the exercise of that will. How does my friend put it That the temptation had nothing to do with the sin— that the sin might have been without the temptation. But the question is not what might have been, but what is. The question for this evening is—Is the Bible account and doctrine of original sin theoretically unjust and practically pernicious I put it to you, that it is the Bible account which my friend is bound to. There was the temptation that influenced the woman. My friend averred that the serpent persuaded the woman; put inuendoes to the woman; misrepresented the character of God to the woman ; and yet all this is nothing! If so, it might have been all left out of the statement. But yet my friend did not consider it nothing, for he made it part of his ease. His last speech involves another and a greater confession. He says it is not true that man's perfection may not be deduced from the book, and he road to you a text in Ephesians iv. 24, and a text from Colossians iii. 10; " That ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness." " And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him." Now, I ask, what is there here to connect it with Adam i&amp;t all There is flot i«ne word</page><page sequence="107">third evening. 103 about restoring the image of Adam. And then my friend, by his text in Genesis, reduced himself to this dilemma. He says that man was made in the image of God, and therefore was perfect. Then he was the image of God in his intellect; because if so, he should have had the same knowledge of God as God had. Man's knowledge must have been the reflex of God's knowledge. If he was not the image of God in this, he was not the image of God at all, and the whole doctrine .of perfection falls to pieces. Then he says, " If you will not have Adam for a representative, neither shall you have Christ." Well, what if you do not What serious consequences will ensue? He says you have salvation without money and without price, or a perfect salvation to the heathen, the imbecile, the idiotic. I admit it; but does he bring it to the true, honest, intellectual man, to the men of mark, to the men who are striving to raise one another up He does not bring salvation to them. We want no salvation through Christ. We want salvation by redeeming ourselves. Our friend says, it matters not whether Christ came to redeem us from the consequences of Adam's sin, or whether he came to redeem us from the consequences of our own sins. But to-night it does. The question to-night is—Is the doctrine of original sin theoretically unjust and practically pernicious And that doctrine is, that Adam left us a legacy of misery, and of ills, and of damnation. Our friend carefully avoids this ; for while he tells us that men were exposed to damnation, but would not be damned for Adam's sin, he refrained entirely from commenting on that. What is the difference between being exposed to damnation and having it Are the heathen, the idiotic, the imbecile, exposed to it Who are Is it only the men of intellect, of learning—only they who are striving to know—are these the only ones Then you will tell me that Christ has come with salvation openhanded for those who do not deserve it; and you will people heaven full of the ignorant and foeble, casting out those who have striven to make themselves better. At any rate, if my friend did not mean that, it sounded very much like it. Let us follow him further. He says, that if we had each fallen separately, Christ's redemption would have been necessary for us. We, as infidels, hardly think so. You sorrow for me. Now, I tell you the only salvation I know of. We do not believe in Christ redeeming man. We do not believe in one God, who could not die, dying for human kind to save them from sins yet uncommitted, and which God, the planner of all things, must have planned them to commit. Wo believe if man does wrong in</page><page sequence="108">104 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. his plucking of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, in each age of his life, he acquires by that act the means of pre¬ serving it. We do not believe in Christ's redemption of human kind, made out 2,000 years ago ; but we believe in a redemption worked out in daily life, in the little ills of life, moment by moment, hour by hour, day by day, year by year—working out thus the muchness of life. We do not believe in death-bed repentances, which, sponge-like, can wipe out a life of crime. We hold that no man is so infallible and perfect that he may not do as I did just now—make a slip, commit an error, a wrong ; but we hold that, having done it, the only redemption is to set it right the moment he can. Christ redeems it not. Cunning redeems it not. Faith redeems it not. Knowing the wrong, avoid it, or boldly fight against it. The past is done, and you cannot recall it; but you may have a glorious present, marking a still more glorious and bright future. You talk of heaven; of the future life; of sorrow for my infidelity. I sorrow for you, who would have me turn life into a valley of the shadow of death, when I would make it a valley of life, the sunshine of which shall rise upon your old church and chapel spires, gladden¬ ing, and making even them glitter—churches and chapels in which you have guarded and shut up the knowledge of good and evil. Some few words more, and I have done. You hold me an honest doubter ; I am not an honest doubter upon the points we have met to discuss. I did doubt—I did inquire; but, upon the points on which we have contended hand to hand, I am no doubter. Your faith is to me rotten, intolerant, and false; derived from the cruelty, the bigotry, the barbarism of a bygone age. I see how the stake, the fire, the faggot, the prison, have been the best answers to those heretics who braved them. And instead of sorrowing that I am on this side, I am glad indeed that, humble, weak though I be, my name may be enrolled on that muster-roll of heroes who, with their brains, have helped to work out the redemption of man. One word more. What have you told us in this debate that should gladden us What is the plan you have laid before us It is that God, the Father of human kind, making the first of his children, and not knowing what he will do, has to experimen¬ talize with him to see what he will do. That experiment being a failure, he repents that he has made men, and drowns them in a deluge; and then, getting tired of drowning them, sends his son, who is not his son, but himself, who cannot die, to die for human¬ kind ; and you would have us take for an example the form of a</page><page sequence="109">THIRD EVENING. 105 God upon the cross, crying out," My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me!" This doctrine is practically pernicious, it repels all humanity, and here I impeach it; and, for your sonow, pay you back my joy that human intellect, waking up moment by moment, is giappling with falsehood, and that by-and-by the truth, majestic from the ruins of human faith, may rise up, giving liberty to human life.

Subject :—Does secularism, which admits the authority of nature alone, and which appeals to reason as the best means of arriving at truth, offer a sivrer basis for human conduct than Christianity, which rests its claims on a presumed Divine revelation The Umpiee (Mr. Harvey) announced that, at the conclusion of the debate, Messrs. Ward and Co., of Paternoster Row, would, with the consent and approval of all parties, including the dis¬ putants, publish in a separate form the official verbatim report of the proceedings. Iconoclast :—The subject for discussion this evening is thus worded: " Does secularism, which admits the authority of nature alone, and which appeals to reason as the best means of arriving at truth, offer a surer basis for human conduct than Christianity, which rests its claims on a presumed Divine revelation ?" By the word " nature" in this question, I shall understand and express the entirety of existence—the universe. And this question thus affirms that a surer basis is offered from an inves¬ tigation of the phenomena of existence than can be possibly derived from the authority of the Bible. By reason I shall here, express the sum of man's intellectual ability—the totality of per¬ ception, reflection, comprehension, and generalization, culminating in volition. The question affirms that secularism offers a surer basis for human conduct than that which is offered by the Bible; and I shall, during the first portion of my speech, endeavour to ascertain what basis for human conduct it is that the Bible affords. And the only way I know of ascertaining this, is by</page><page sequence="111">FOUETH EVENING. 107 taking one or two illustrations of Bible conduct as contained in the Bible, and I shall then endeavour to ascertain, if I can, what guide to truth, what source of truth, may be found in the Bible. I shall endeavour to see whether the Bible is a sufficient standard by which you may decide what is truth, and this can only be done by giving you a very brief—necessarily brief, because of the time—epitome of the Bible. When I have done these two things, some time during the evening I shall endeavour to illustrate in what respects secularism is superior; where its basis seems to me to be better founded; why I prefer the one to the other. First, what basis does the Bible afford for human conduct I will take a case which doubtless will be familiar to the minds of most of you, and which certainly will be very familiar to my friend on tho other side—the case of Jael, the wife of Heber. You may remember that the Jews, who, being God's chosen people, were mostly killing some one or being killed by some one, were at war with the Philistines. In the time of the Judges there were a people under the government of a king called Jabin, and the Jews were then under the leadership of a prophetess. Then- forces under the command of Barak, a general appointed by the prophetess, met the forces of Sisera, the general of Jabin, king of Hazor, and battle ensued. The forces of Jabin, king of Hazor, were defeated. Sisera, the general, fled, dis¬ mounting from his chariot for tho purpose of fleeing faster; and he came to the tent of Heber the Kenite. There was peace between the house of Heber the Kenite and the house of Jabin, the king of Hazor. Sisera went into the tent. Sisera partook of the hospitality of the tent. Sisera was invited to recruit him¬ self there, was invited to rest, was invited to lie down and par¬ take of focd; and of all the Eastern virtues, hospitality probably has drawn forth the highest praise from all writers. Sisera relied upon the hospitality of the friendly tent which sheltered him. He lay down weary. Ho slept. And while he slept, Jael, the wife of Heber, treacherously, without warning, there being peace between her husband's house and this man's house, took hammer and nail and murdered the man as he slept, in cold blood. Now what language does the Bible apply to that con¬ duct If I, a secularist, were speaking of it, I should con¬ demn the conduct of Jael, the wife of Heber, as inhospitable, treacherous, cold-blooded, and the whole as a murder. The Bible, however, deals with it in different language, which I will read to you from the 5th of Judges, beginning at the 24th verse: " Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Ileber the Kenite</page><page sequence="112">108 MODERN atheism and the bible. be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent." And for what is this woman blessed Some praise women for their beauty, some for their virtues, some for their kindliness; occa¬ sionally a Joan of Arc is praised for her heroism, a Grace Darling for hers; a Florence Nightingale for her heroism of a different nature, but which still commands our highest admiration. What is Jael, the wife of Heber, praised for For some act of heroism, some nobility of character, some kindliness, some virtue: that she was a good nurse, that she was a good wife, that she was a kind hostess Read! " He asked water and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish; she put her hand to the nail and her right hand to the workmen's hammer, and with the hammer she smote Sisera; she smote off his head when she had pierced and smitten through his temples." The chief point in the life of Jael, the wife of Heber, is, that she murdered a man while he was sleeping, relying upon her kindli¬ ness and hospitality; and for this we are told that Jael, the wife of Heber, is to be blessed above all women. I will take one other case of conduct, which my friend must not reproach me for because it has been often taken; one which he must not tell me is coarse and stale because it has often been used. Coarse I admit it is, but I did not make it coarse. Rough I admit it is, but I did not put it in the book. I mean the life and career of David the son of Jesse, the man after God's own heart. Here is a man who, if one can imagine a foul monster— who, if one can picture a man without honour, a man without honesty, a man without patriotism, a bad husband, a wicked father, a cruel, despicable, mean, unmanly monster—then David is that. Take his life. Look at it as carefully as you will, and tell me what redeeming qualities will you find me in it I will not refer more than for a moment to his treachery to Uriah, and to the cold-blooded murder which followed, and hid that treachery out of sight in its horrid bloodiness, because this is only one event of that man's life. His whole life was the life of a robber, of a thief, of a liar ; the life of a man so unpatriotic, that when his country's enemies were making war upon him, he would have sold his own sword with the murmuring cowards who followed him to pillage and rob the people of his own country. Ho was a man who, when an outlaw from his own country, actually robbed and murdered the very people who gave him shelter; robbing them first and then murdering them, lest they should impeach him of his crime before the king under whose shelter he lived. This man, his whole career one of blood, what do we find of him in the Bible Repeated endorsements, repeated approvals,</page><page sequence="113">fourth evening. 109 repeated statements that he obeyed God's statutes and kept his commandments. I know it is sometimes said that God is ever- merciful, and that by some repentance—some tardy death-bed sponge, which cleared away the national debt of his iniquity—he got rid of all; but there is not even a pretext for it. It is not true. When this tiger, who had all his life sated himself with human gore, was on his death-bed, when this murderer could murder no longer, how was his repentance expressed? This man after God's own heart, how did he breathe out his humanity, how did he out-utter his kindliness, how did he make known his love He is on his death-bed. His hairs are grey, his form is weak, his life-light is nearly quenched. What does he do Does he say, " I repent, I am sorry" Does his trembling mouth give utterance to any such even mere sham and show of repentance on this Not one word of it. He has beside him his son, his favourite son, the son of that Bathsheba whose husband he murdered. Would not that bring to the bed¬ side of the dying man some memory of the horrid past, one passage at least of his terrible career Not one whit of it. He is about to die. Oh, sometimes we are told of infidel death-bed scenes Take me the only dying scenes you find in this book, not printed by your enemies but by yourselves, which you tell me is a revelation from God to man; take me these dying scenes, and say, should your own shame not efface the printing of them before you manufacture calumnies on our great dead, whom in their lives you could not answer What does this dying David say—this man who after his death is approved—of whom we are told that he obeyed God's statutes, kept his commandments, and walked with him all the days of his life, not in one verse alone, but in ten, a dozen, a score at least This dying David when about to die, directs his son that two old men, who in a short time will totter to their graves from very age, shall be pushed a little quicker towards the precipice, and that their hoar hairs shall be brought to the grave stained with blood. I pass the code for human conduct contained in the Bible, and I ask how I am to take the Bible as a standard of faith The only way to judge of it is by seeing whether the Bible is itself true, whether it bears on itself the mark of being true or false ; because, if it be self-contradictory, if it bo so monstrously inco¬ herent that no sane man can read it without its incoherency meeting him full-butt, running against him—then I say it fails as a standard. I will therefore go on with my resume of what the contents of the Bible are. It may be that in dealing with them I shall do them injustice. If so, my friend is here to correct me.</page><page sequence="114">110 modern atheism and the bible. Tho Bible opens, as you all know, with an account of the crea¬ tion. It tells you, that when God made the world it was without form, and void—that is to say, there was nothing inside of it, and no shape to it outside. Our friend will, I dare say, tell you that that is coherent. I pass it, however. It tells you there were evening and morning before there was a sun, of which the appa¬ rent rising and the apparent setting, and the twilight accompa¬ nying it, was called evening and morning—even before there was a sun to which the phrase could justly be applied. It tells you that God made—as our friend told you the other evening—the herbs of the field and the trees before he made man; but that he did not make them bearing seed and fruit until after he made man. It tells you that he made the fowls of the air out of water; but he did not, but made them out of the ground. It tells you that he made all the animals before he made man ; but that he did not till after he had created man. It tells you that he made man and woman upon the same day; but that he did not, for he made man several days before he made woman. [" Question."] Question! When our friend rises to debate, it will bo time enough for him to call question; and at present the question is, Is the Bible a standard of truth, or have the secularists a better standard And I shall show to you that the Bible is an incoherent jumble of falsehood from one end to the other. It tells you that man and woman were made together, but that they weic made separately, and that God saw it was not good that man should be alone. It tells you that he gave to man the fruit of every tree for food; but that he did not. It tells you that the end of the whole was very good; but that it was so bad, that God had to curse man. It tells you that God made man and woman, placing them in the garden, to till it and to tend it; that then, as our friend tells you, a literal serpent came and deceived the woman, by talking to her and tempting her to take of the fruit of a literal tree; that the voice of God, or God himself—for they " heard the voice " of God walking in the garden in the cool of the day—inquiied for something which he must have known all about before learning it from them ; then expelled them from the garden for that which was foreknown, and then placed at the gate of tho garden cherubim, with flaming sword turning every way, to guard the way to the tree of life—which, if man had ate, he might have lived for ever, despite of the all-powerful God. It tells you that Cain and Abel began to worship God; that Cain brought to him the first fruits of the field, and that Abel, with a keen apprecia¬ tion of the Deity of the Bible, brought the firstlings of the flock. It tells you that Cain's offering of the first fruits of the field,</page><page sequence="115">fourth evening. Ill sweet and pure in their fragance, was rejected, being displeasing to God; that Abel's offering was respected, and that out of the first endeavour to worship God murder arose. Our friend may say that that is but an illustration of the religions of the world ; but I say that out of every effort to worship God much murder has been done; and that even now, in the endeavour to worship God, though Christians do not bathe their hands in one another's blood, it is not because they would not, but because they dare not; because a mightier power than faith has arisen in the world—the power of human intellect and public opinion—which bursts through the doors of ecclesiastical dungeons. It tells you that Cain, for this murder, is expelled from the presence of the Lord, who is everywhere, and from whose presence none can escape; and that, having then no sisters, and there being no woman in the world beside his mother, he marries a wife and begets a family, v&gt;ho dwell in a laud where the Lord is not. It tells you that the land then became polluted, and that the people being very vricked, the Lord, who could have prevented it, but did not, said, " My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh;" that God then determined to destroy the world and every one in it, because he could not make them better, though his Spirit had striven with them in endeavouring to do it. He is grieved about it—-is sorry—and repents him that he has made man. He grieves at his heart, and determines to destroy him; not that God repents, because God is not a man that he should repent. Our friend will probably tell you that it is literally true that he did repent, but that it is figuratively true that he cannot; that there are not contradictions in these things, but only apparent inconsistencies. God, having determined to deluge the world, our friend says—but the Bible does not-—that he gave man 120 years' warning. He told Noah, certainly ; but it does not appear by the Bible that he told anybody else. He then shut him up in an ark and opened the windows of heaven— which might have existed then, but which, if they did, have been done away with since—and let down the waters to deluge the earth; and the earth was deluged, fifteen cubits upwards, high above the highest mountains. It came from nowhere, did an immense amount of mischief, and went back again. When the deluge subsided, after it bad continued ten months—not quite ten months, but nearly so—Noah sent out a dove, which went and brought him back the leaf of an olive. True, the whole earth had been deluged, and all vegetable matter was decomposed; but your faith can make an olive, at least, or otherwise there will be no leaf for the dove to pluck. But, that done, and the deluge over, Noah and his family,</page><page sequence="116">112 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. the few who were saved, came out of the ark. An altar is builded ; a sacrifice, involving further slaughter, is offered to God ; and God smells a sweet savour when the whole earth is covered with the carcases of millions of murdered human beings rotting there, the wrecks of his vengeance. He smells a sweet savour, and makes a covenant with man and beast, and promises that he will not destroy them any more, " because the thought of their heart was evil continually." God had brought this punishment upon human kind for their past crimes; but he lets them re- people the world under precisely the same conditions, tending to crime again. And then they multiply, and assemble on a plain, and think to build a city and tower whose top shall reach to heaven; but God, who is everywhere, but happens at that time not to be down on the earth, comes and prevents it. Then God, who is not a respecter of persons, respects one man more than the rest, and promises him that his seed shall be as numerous as the sand on the sea-shore, or as the stars of heaven. This man, Abraham, was chosen perhaps for his valour. Our friend will explain to us whether that was so—whether it was because, with 318 servants, he so defeated some of the most powerful kings of the earth, that one of his friends, who was dead before he went out to fight, met him alive on bis way back, to congratulate him on his victory. Perhaps he will explain to us how it was that when Sarah, the wife of Abraham, was too old to have children, nearly a hundred years of age, a king took her away from her husband, finding her sufficiently beautiful and attractive for this purpose. Perhaps he will explain, too, how it was, that when the king committed a crime, God punished the people for it. Perhaps he will tell you whether that was part of God's policy ; and when Abraham died, leaving the whole of his property to Isaac, perhaps he will tell you what became of his other pro¬ perty, which he gave to his other children. Then, going on, perhaps he will tell us why Jacob, who deceived his brother out of his birthright, and deceived his father out of his blessing, makes a bargain with God as to how long he should worship him, goes to his uncle and deceives him, and inherits eternal hap¬ piness; while Esau, robbed of his birthright, is shut out from it. Perhaps he will account for it how that the twelve patriarchs, who are destined to be the founders of his race, and who are the types of the twelve tribes, are themselves so villanous that they could not even be true to one another, selling their own brother into slavery, which our friend tells us was never practised under the Bible dispensation. Then he will tell us how it was that God's chosen people were allowed to get into captivity until their</page><page sequence="117">FOURTH EVENING. 113 cries and groanings came to God, and God remembered them whom he had promised always to protect, and keep from such strife as that. Then I dare say he will explain to us how it was that God, having chosen Moses to be the leader of his people, sought to kill him, when, if he had succeeded in his murderous intent, he could never have led them at all. He will then explain the absurdities of the plagues, which I will not comment on; and he will tell us how the invisible God was seen by seventy- four persons, he being so chary of his presence that he showed himself to his chosen servant in his back parts only, being without bodily parts and invisible. Perhaps he will tell us about the siege of Jericho, when the priests, having circled the city seven times, shouted with a loud shout and blew the trumpets, and down fell all the walls flat. I ask my friend whether he would recommend any sensible man to make siege to a city in such a fashion to-day, and whether, if his faith is not strong enough for it in 1862, it is strong enough to say that it happened hundreds of years ago He will tell me whether he believes in the account of Gideon, who, with three hundred men armed with empty pitchers, with lanterns inside of them, frightened a huge number of men to death, " I will not go further, because in another part of my speech it will be my duty to show that the New Testament is as incoherent and absurd as this. The secularist, instead of relying on such a book as this, which in its narratives has no respect for truth, and in its details is no guide for human conduct, would tell you that man's duty is to discover truth, and to use his discoveries for the purpose of promoting human happiness around him. Secularism would tell him that the surest test of truth lies in the verification of his perceptions, and in his giving to his fellows what he believes to be truth and fact. For how is it with knowledge It is like as though you had gone down deep into the mines of the world and brought up thence stones, which are apparently valueless, except to the man who knows their worth. You take them to a lapidary and he polishes them, and they adorn the diadem of the king. Secularism holds that the great mine of existence contains stones of truth, valuable above all price; and that, diving into the depths of that mine, rough though they are when you bring them up, you may throw them out as you will; and that each man's brain is as a lapidary, polishing those that are good and true, and returning them back to you resplendent gems to adorn the mightiest diadem that ever king wore in this world. But a few words more and I have done. If our friend says he</page><page sequence="118">114 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. has a better standard than man—for he tells you that man is no standard at all—I ask him how it is that every victory that man has achieved in science or in truth has been achieved, not through this book, but in spite of it, and in opposition to it Will he explain how it is that there has been no new science, no unfolding of thought in the world, but what the preachers and holders-up of faith—the kneclers down in chapels and churches—have been the most determined opposers of it; have pressed their fingers around the neck of the infant truth, and failing- to strangle it, while pretending to be its nurse, have been ever ready to oppose its heroic course? Secularism admits the authority of nature alone. I am called sometimes irreverent—sometimes scoffing— but what does that mean? It means that I admit the whole, but not a part. The grandeur of the mighty universe, I cannot assail it; but when one man, the holder of one out of many rotten creeds, rushes forward with his Act of Parliament printed book, supported by your rich and rotten church, and tells me that that is the whole, then I am obliged to tell him that it is not, and never was; that it does not hold the heroism, the oratory, the poetry, the patriotism, and the humanity of the world; but is the product of a wicked, weak, and bygone age, far from us and out of use; and I appeal, then, to my friend to recognise, with me, that mighty standard which never errs, because each day it is speaking to you. Yours is dumb to-day; it only spoke 2,000 years ago, but ours is ever talking. Now it has a tongue from the mine; now a tongue from the ocean; now from the rivers; now from the trees; now from the broad firmament; now from some old quarry, revealing to us a broad page in the history of the world, pointing out its antiquity, showing you where the foot of time has trodden thousands of years before your dogmas dreamed of man at all. It brings us back to the heroism of youth, even in this our age, showing us how we are vital; and, instead of teaching man to look out for the day of judgment, it would teach man to make a day of judgmont for himself in every day of his life; each thought, each deed, being its own judge and vindicator to after ages, telling them what it has done, and how it has done it. I will say but ono word more. Our friend and I have passed through more than half of this debate. Let me tell him, that though neither of us may convince the other, a great truth lies in our hands. We are met here for the truth, and we are each bound to do our best; and when I attack your book and your faith, it is only because I believe it to be a shackle round men,.an4 I would nerve my arm to the uttermost that I may break these</page><page sequence="119">FOURTH EVENING. 115 fetters which old customs have bound round humanity, and cry out, " Let thought be free " Mr. Barker:—If I found a large company of men hungering after bread, would I give them flowers instead of bread What, then, would be thought if I offered them stinking poppies instead of sweet roses? Now, according to my friend's own confession, humanity is hungering after knowledge; but he has given them little knowledge to-night. We have had a series of captious objections against a book which, notwithstanding all he has said against it, will survive after his bones have turned to ashes. And not only so. We came here to-night to hear something about secu¬ larist truth, not Bible truth. I did not intend to touch the Bible to-night. Why, therefore, has he gone to the Bible Our proposition does not allow either of us to touch the Bible, strictly speaking, because it simply refers to a presumptive revelation, and not a real one; and I was willing, for the sake of argument, to give him the benefit of the doubt he may have in regard to the Bible as a specific book, and to deal purely and simply with the question whether humanity stands in need of a revelation or not; then afterwards we might, perhaps, come to the discussion whether that revelation should be found in the Bible or not. I did come, however, expecting that, as my friend is an advocate of nature and an advocate of reason, he would simply define the two things, which, to a certain extent, I admit he has done. I am not prepared, therefore, to quarrel with him on that account—so far as his definitions are concerned; but I expected that he would show how his own system, in dis¬ tinction from all other systems—whether heathen, Mahommedan, or Christian—embodies the results of nature in direct, positive teaching; embodies also things concerning which human reason is calculated to direct and regulate human conduct far better than the things which are contained in the book which, of course, as a Christian, I believe in, but which it is no part of our proper business to-night thoroughly to discuss. About my friend's definition of nature I shall not say much. I shall of course touch upon it; but immediately after giving this definition, my friend turned away to make an attack upon the Bible—and that not upon its moral teachings, which might have been fair play so far, if he had kept to that aspect of the book, and taken no other—but rather upon its histories and its biographies; and who does not know that if a country or a country's laws were to be judged of by the history of that country, or by the character of even its principal inhabitants, the whole thing might be pronounced rotten Ah! the most</page><page sequence="120">116 MODERN ATHEISM AND TOE BIBLE. secular monarchy or republic that the world ever had might be on the same principles pronounced rotten. We have not to do to-night either with antediluvian characters, or with persons who have lived since the deluge. We are free as Christians to admit, on a proper occasion, and when the nature of our argument requires it, that there are things in the characters of the persons he has referred to to-night that are not praiseworthy or lovely; and that the Bible does not endorse their actions in these respects, we are also prepared to show on a fitting occasion that the Bible is true. I do not see, for my part, that I have any right to touch the case of Jael, or any other case; in fact, I refuse to touch upon them to-night. I will tell you what I will do though. When we have done with our propositions, I will meet him without a proposition—anywhere and at any time—to take up these cases one by one, in a free exposition on both sides, to see which is the most legitimate, and which best accords on the one hand with human reason, and on the other hand with the teachings of the book in which these cases are found; therefore I dispense with these matters, and must bring him back to the point. We have met here for one purpose of great moment, as he has said in his closing remarks, and it is to find out, if possible, what is the proper definition of nature; to find out also what is the proper definition of reason; to find out in what consists the authority of nature, and her capacity to teach mankind; and in what consists the authority of reason, and in what respects she is superior as a guide to anything else we can have. What has my friend said, however, about these things He has put many questions to me in illustration of his view of the case. I must also put a few questions in return. Is nature something distinct from reason Is reason synonymous with nature Is it only a part of nature, and not the whole Then it may prove to be an incompetent exponent of nature as a whole; and if that is not fair reasoning, tell me what is. But if it be synonymous with nature, why have we got them distinct in our proposition to-night, for they stand as two things in our proposition Nature, we are told, is an absolute exclusive authority for man in matters affecting his morals and religion. I want to know, if that be so, whether the history of the world will show it, and whether the right principles appertaining to human reason will sustain the assertion What does nature mean Let us have a clear definition of it. Perhaps we may find some discrepancy between the thing so called and that which is supposed to be our authority. Again, is the fact that secularism appeals to nature and to reason,</page><page sequence="121">FOURTH EVENING. 117 sufficient to qualify it to utter its verdict as a surer basis of human conduct than Christianity, or any other system which the world has given truth to, and which great masses of men have followed This is an important question. Do not the endless sects connected with a revealed religion each and all appeal to the book But can they, because they appeal to the book, each and all have an equal amount of truth on their side, and an equal amount of authority—religious, moral authority—when their systems are in many respects so contraiy, so conflicting, and in some things so absurd Now, let us have fair play. I see nothing in the mere fact of secularism appealing to nature or to reason to qualify her to teach man any better than he is taught by other means. The deist, be it known, appeals to nature, and what does he find there He finds one great first cause, which my friend—a naturalist—cannot find there. Why is the natural man—pure, unbiased, natural man—with all his reasoning faculties, inadequate and incompetent to decide The one or the other must be wrong. How, then, can nature teach? Surely they are both human, and therefore a mode, and the same mode of existence which he has defined to us to-night. How am I to know, then, whether to take the deist's version of nature or the atheist's Please tell me that. Again, secularism must give positive and practical teachings which she "draws" from nature, and she must not give those which she has borrowed from us and tack them on to nature. At least, she must not give them without acknowledging that they are common ground with a great deal that we teach, and then we shall have no dispute on those points. I want to know what there is in the fact of a Bible religion which prevents my appealing to nature Do not I know how to read the stars as well as my friend If not, the Bible is not at fault; it is because I have not studied astronomy as well as he has. That is the only reason. Am I not competent to know what are the properties of the human body, by physiology, etc., as well as he, though I believe in the Bible If not, my Bible is not at fault, but the absence of culture in that science which would have made me stand equal with him. Let us have fair reasoning. Secularism, we are told, appeals to nature. Now, my dear friends, I have often heard, when a boy, about Dame Nature, but I want to know what Dame Nature is I am reminded of a curious case said to have happened, of a lad, who, when an apprentice, ran away and got married; and his master, being responsible for his maintenance, felt as though he were in a fix. However, he allowed him a certain weekly amount because he was married,</page><page sequence="122">118 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. and permitted him still to board in his house. He said one day, when the boy complained that he had not got enough to keep his wife, " What led you to get married, sir ?" " Nature taught me, sir." Now, I want to know, if nature taught him that he would be hungry as well as want a vrife, if it was his duty to feed his wife as well as himself? I think it would. I am a naturalist so far as that; and I think reason would teach him, too, that the part of his nature which wanted a wife ought certainly to have stood aside till he could keep a Wife. That would be according to reason and nature, it strikes me! I find a great deal that is as incoherent as that in connexion with the teachings of secularism, so far as I can find them, though I hardly know where to find them In what department of our nature do we find a basis for human conduct Do not go to sleep my friends, to-night, if I do! (Laughter.) A threefold aspect^of nature has been admitted by our proposition the other night, namely—physical, moral, and intellectual. In which of these respects, then, is nature the best teacher, and in which respect does reason lay the best foundation for my conduct? Is one separate from the other, or are they all combined? Do you know that I am naturalist enough to say that she lays a tolerably good foundation in a great many respects for all three aspects of my nature, but I do not think she goes quite far enough. I take nature with me, and abide with her as far as she is right; but when I find some elements in my being—my intellectual, for instance, or my moral being—about which nature, on the one hand, is silent, and about which reason, on the other hand, is incompetent to give a deci¬ sion—I willingly accept a light from another source, that which appears to me a light from heaven and from God, because I feel, that if all other parts of my nature have their appropriate ali¬ ment, it is only proper that those higher sentiments of my heart should have their aliment too; and I do not find anything in ma¬ thematics to make me moral, nor in astronomy, except it be in the old adage, " I look through nature up to nature's God." And I see in nature's God, to whom I am thus led, reasons for adora¬ tion, and worship, and love, which I cannot find in stars, nor trees, nor flowers. Go a little further then. Nature and reason have a sphere of their own, independently of Christianity, and Christianity does not deny reason; she makes her appeal to reason. Nature, according to Spurzheim, whose book I have in my hand-— though we have had no quotations to-night, but only comments- -^nature, though she1 makes her appeal to' reason, is-not on that</page><page sequence="123">FOURTH BTENIXTG. T19 account entitled to come in and give to man the superior teaching which he asks for. And now I come to my friend's definitions. I thought, perhaps, if I prepared an argument on three distinct definitions, by two of the greatest naturalists in the world, who do not profess to have any attachment to the Bible, I should catch him at some point; and now I have caught him on the first point, for he has admitted that nature is the great universal existence. About that matter, Volney has a word too; and it will be worth while to refer to him. He says, " The word nature comprehends three distinct significations. It means the universe, or materia] world." We say, according to this signification, " the beauties of nature," " the riehes of nature ;" that is, of the objects in heaven and earth presented to our contemplation. Spurzheim makes also three propositions, and the third is precisely like in sense, though not in terms. And now my friend says that he takes this universal existence as a definition of nature, and upon that I am bound to put to him a question. I want to know how many secularists are competent to understand nature as a whole How many of the men in my presence to-night have been far beyond smoky London—and how, then, do they know much of nature as a whole? How many have been far beyond the bounds of this little sea-girt isle, where only portions of nature's grand developments are to be seen ?—how, then, can they one by one study, and think, and decide upon what is nature as a whole Why, I tell you, without intending to offend you, that some of you could not tell me the difference between an oak tree and an elm tree—no, not if you were out walking in the fields ; and that you, some of you at least, could not tell me the difference between a rose and a double poppy. You have an answer for me, how¬ ever, which you think is a fair one, and I will give you fair play. You say, " Our leaders and teachers do know." Very well, do rh'ey If you think so, believe in them; but I want to know what entitles them to have all this knowledge attributed to them beyond other men. We have come to contrary decisions about the voice of nature to that which they have come to—where is the difference On what ground are they superior to others I want to know why it is you know that their instructions are infallible, if you know nothing about it Oh, oh you are saved by faith, are you, in the secular world Well, now, faith is one' of a trio of excellencies in Christianity. " Now abideth faith, hope, and charity." Which are the other two of the trio in se¬ cularism You have got faith—faith in your leaders, who know all about it, according to your own showing. I make the trio to be faith in the secular leaders; confusion in one's own mind; and</page><page sequence="124">120 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. despair as the result. You say, we only have faith in them till we can know for ourselves; and by-and-by we shall have studied astronomy and geography, and a world of other things, and then we shall be able ourselves to be teachers. So much the better. The sooner you know for yourselves the better, depend upon it. And Christianity has the same principle, too, as far as the prin¬ ciple itself goes, though not in the application of it, I am glad to say. She says, " Now I know in part; now I walk by faith; but by-and-by I shall see, and by-and-by I shall know, even as I am known." Very well, then, there is no difference as far as that goes as to the radical principles on which humanity acts in this great matter; and I say, it is by the results alone, therefore, in that aspect of the case, that we are capable of deciding. But religious doctrines are equally applicable and equally based. I shall not, however, go further in my remarks upon definitions of nature. I shall now turn to some definitions about reason. I hold that my friend's definition in the main is a correct one, so we are not going to quarrel about that. There is another definition, however, about reason, which we frequently agree to use in common language —ah! and in secular writings, too—namely, " the deductions of the human mind concerning truth"—truth above the reach of the sensorial and sensitive nature of man. By this process we know things of which we should otherwise have no idea. By this process we enlarge the sphere of knowledge by reflection, and our complete ideas are made out of our simple ones. By this process we regulate our assent or denial to things that are taught us, come they from whom they may; and one great commenda¬ tion in Scripture concerning the old Bereans who heard the preaching of Paul was, that they were more noble than those of Thessalonica, because they had searched to see if those things were so. Reason leads us into the knowledge of hidden results not cognizable by sensation. In matters of absolute demonstration she has little^ however, to do; for the results are so obvious, and at the same time so independent of her, that she is obliged to accept them by a mathematical necessity. Reason fails to be an adequate guide where she has not the assistance of complex ideas already recognised. Now, when the ideas of the mind fail us as to presenting the thing to be decided upon, reason is put out of court, and has no decision to give, one way or other. My friend says " I have no idea of a God, and that I do not know whether man is matter or spirit—I cannot tell. I believe in matter only— a mode of existence—and I take the mode of existence as a fact, though what it is I do not know." Well, that is very wonderful</page><page sequence="125">FOURTH EVENING. 121 and sage; but reason is out of court on the very principle I have laid down. She has no decision to give on the one side or the other. If that be disputed, the argument will have to come over again. Reason is often at fault. Reason is often prejudiced. Volney himself recognises that fact, and speaks of it in his "Ruin of Empires;" and on that account, together with the incom¬ petency of man individually, and one by one, to decide by himself what is right, when he had seen all things destroyed, and the new world was to be made after his fashion, they had legislators to make it for them. A false principle, laid down as a starting- point for reason, of necessity leads to a false conclusion. Reason has no power to correct the process, or control it when once she has laid down her first premises; and therefore the only way to deal with an error at all is to cut at the root of it. The first proposi¬ tion must be disproved, and then all else is disproved. In all moral and speculative inquiries we meet some first principles which are declared to us to be correct or false. What are the mutual relations between reason and faith If I had had time, I meant to have given you a quotation from Locke, one of our greatest mental philosophers; but I come now to some of the results of my preceding remarks. First, we have a direct means of varied knowledge and pleasure in personal sensation, chiefly in relation to facts and external objects. Secondly, we take facts, of which we are cognisant, and by induction or deduction arrive at the truth contained in those facts. Thirdly, the province of reason is to inquire and accept—not to dictate beyond the sphere of her own observation, nor to understand what is not, nor to decide what must or ought to be. Reason cannot create facts ; she has no right to deny facts when they have been made known to her, unless she can utterly confound the evidence, and disprove it. Another mode of knowing is to believe, and in certain cases faith works with sense and with reason; in other cases, it has the power of working alone upon testimony; and where the testimony is good, and its voice in evidence correct, that is the highest form of knowledge; its comes nearest to the vital in¬ terests of man's moral powers, and has the greatest potency in moulding his character and swaying his actions. True wisdom it is to admit the facts of life, for we cannot control them, whatever we may attempt by any fair process of reasoning. We may deny; but, when our denial has been most vociferous as well as inconsistent, the facts remain and the truths are un¬ touched, and the glory of them is all the greater because they could not be touched. It is an insult to man to say he is not capable of faith. It is an insult to say there are no interests G</page><page sequence="126">122 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. in his nature which require the action of faith, even if you shut out a future life; and it would be the utter destruction at this very moment of all the social, commercial, civil, and moral in¬ terests of society, even from a naturalist's point of view, if faith were banished from the world, shut out from the catalogue of our thoughts or rule of action, and the principles on which we decide, think, feel, act, rejoice, and be sorry, do or not do, be or not be. Here the Umpire called " Time." Iconoclast :—My friend objects that I ought not this evening to have touched the Bible at all; that it did not form any por¬ tion of the question. The question is, Does secularism offer a surer basis than Christianity, which rests on a presumed Divine revelation ?—and the only way in which I could show you that it does, is by showing you what tho one basis is and what the other basis is also. I have sought to do that, and what is my friend's reply? A reply I have often heard before. "I won't answer it to-night, but I will some other night." Now, this is not the first occasion upon which I have heard such an argument in the mouth of a Christian advocate; and I cannot be surprised, when he found it necessary to use such a phrase in lieu of argument, that he should also ask you not to go to sleep while he is speaking. Now, our friend says that he does not quarrel with my defini¬ tion of reason in the main, but he wants to know whether reason is the same thing as nature, or whether it is part of nature, or whether it is different from nature. Now, if I could suspect my friend of meaning what he said, I should have to tell him that he ought to study tho value of words before making use of them in a debate of this kind; and the only thing that relieves me from the necessity of so telling him is, that I believe it to be a rather clever attempt at avoidance of a subject by raising issues of no importance, the satisfaction of which to you to-night will be no advancement to the end we seek. If you have made up your minds to hiss at that, you had better prepare to hiss before I have done, because you will have more to hiss at. First, if my friend attended to my definition of reason, it was utterly im¬ possible that he could suppose reason to be a thing at all; for I said that I used " reason" to express the sum of man's intellectual ability, the totalitj' of perception, reflection, comprehension, and generalization; and a man knowing the value of the words he used, would never have put so thoroughly foolish a question as</page><page sequence="127">FOURTH EVENING. 123 my friend put to me in his last speech. I will, if he wishes, tell him that reason is a phase of nature operant, not a part of nature nor distinct from nature; and if my friend will not trouble him¬ self to think over the meaning of the phrases he uses, then in my next speech I will explain it to him still more clearly. Now, he says that he is a Christian naturalist; that he takes nature for some distance; and he says that he does this in the case of astronomy and of physiology. These were the two illustrations he used, and upon these two I will deal with him from the Bible. Whether he calls the Bible a presumed revela¬ tion or no, makes no difference; for to-night it is a book, and if I show that the book is untrustworthy, we can next discuss whether or not it is a revelation. If it is untrustworthy as a standard, we are not to trust it to-night. AVhat does it teach in astronomy That God made the firmament, and that " he made lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons," and so on. And we are told God made " two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, the lesser light to rule the night; he made the stars also, and God set them in the firmament to give light upon the earth." Now I ask my friend if his astronomy teaches him anything so absurd as that I tell him it does not, and that upon this, the very first chapter of the Bible, his astronomy and his religion contradict one another; his nature and his theology are mutually opposed. Then as to physiology. AYhat would he say if, when he went to his doctor to be cured of some disease, he recommended him to take a young bullock and to sprinkle him with fine flour, mingled with oil, and to kill him and burn him ?—why he would say that the man was mad. And diseases of certain kinds are to be removed by remedies such as this, in the Bible. Now, my friend in physiology is at ihsue with his Bible. AVhat [does his Bible say " If any man be sick, call the elders of the church, and let them pray with him, for the prayer of a righteous man availeth much: and the Lord will save the sick." AVhat do people want with hospitals and dispensaries, if prayer and faith can cure But nature has taught them that their theology is a sham in this respect, and they erect hospitals because prayers have failed to cure them. I do not pretend in this debate to imitate my friend in his most happy illustrations. He takes the case of an apprentice who married a wife and was not able to keep her, and he says that he ought to have been taught more than that he wanted a wife. Yes, I admit, if he had appealed to nature, he ought to G 2</page><page sequence="128">124 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. have been taught that; but if he had appealed to the Bible he would not, because he would have learned that God patronized the man who turned his wife into a desert with but little to keep life in her. He would have learned that it is no part of duty, according to the Old Testament, for a man to protect a wife; and that when a poor woman cried the whole night to her husband for mercy, and to God, not a word of reprobation was heard for the coward wretch who let her be abused to death outside the door. But my friend will answer these things when the debate is done. They do not form part of the matters he has to deal with now. They form part of the matters which he will deter¬ mine by-and-by. But here is the distinction. He says, who shall judge nature? It is from nature you are to draw your knowledge. I ask, who shall judge the Bible My friend, or some other minister who holds exactly opposite notions of its teaching? Who shall judge the Bible? There are a thousand sects of Christians cursing one another, making war upon one another, excommunicating, threatening damnation against each other, while they offer eternal life to everybody. AVho shall judge You, or you, or you AVho shall judge asks my friend. I will answer him. In fact, if he had listened to my previous speech, the question would have been unnecessary, for I told him that secularism drew its teachings from no one man, from no one age, from no one country, from no one book,—but from every age, every land, every book, every man, every thought, every utterance. He says, " Oh, you don't know the difference, some of you, between an oak and an elm; therefore you must not preach nature." According to that mode of reasoning I answer, you don't know the difference between the devil and the serpent in the garden of Eden ; and therefore you must not preach Chris¬ tianity. My friend told you the other evening that he was not certain whether the serpent that tempted Eve was not a sort of devil's deputy. A rose and a poppy! AAlry he did not know the difference between the Lord and the angel of the Lord, and yet he is here to refute me, when his reflection has taught him so little. AAre will pass the roses and the poppies too, though I admit I am fond of flowers. My friend, however, gives us not flowers, nor wheat—but chaff, and he expects that I shall accept it as logic. AArell, but then ho says there is faith—not reason, but faith; reason is fallible, reason is fallacious; reason cannot invent facts, cannot deny them. Would you have a fact denied? I admit religion does deny facts. I admit religion crushes the life out of men. I admit that religion burns men at the stake. But the truth rises, despite your faith; rises triumphant against</page><page sequence="129">FOURTH EVENING. 125 that church which has rolled her garments in blood, and in spite of whose excommunications reason has held on its way. No; reason cannot make facts or overturn facts. In fact, thai, is the very position I take on this question. Facts form the sure foun¬ dation for our teaching and of our system. But who knows all facts No one. He says you put your faith in your leaders. If you do, you are no secularists. I never asked you to do that, and I do not read in any secular writings that other teachers do. Put faith in yourselves, and by yourselves knit together the common link of the common human chain; for there is your knowledge and your strength—in no other way. I told my friend the other night that in secularism we have no priest, no boxed-up pulpit teachers, to direct men how they should think; that our church was a world-wide church, taking in all human kind, in which each man was his own priest when he turned out a new thought, and every other man his own priest when, not bowing down to it, but doing battle with it to see whether it was good or false, he has given you a key-stone to a building that superstition can never shake. He has told you that reason can refute no facts, no truths. And here is the great corner of our system. AVe submit every new thought to the testing of reason. If it be true, it abides the test. But my friend says you are saved by faith, and he made a great deal of it. But it is not faith in the incomprehensible, the unknown and the unknow¬ able. Your faith requires men to fling their intellect down at the altar-pieces, where your priesthood puts its foot on it, pre¬ venting its rising again. You hiss ; but I appeal to you—if your love cannot bear while my poor voice is attacking your creed, can I wonder that men, less controlled by educated public opinion than now, burnt men who preceded me long years ago Our friend tells you that this Bible will last when my bones have mouldered into ashes. So it will. So will my thoughts last when my bones have mouldered into ashes. Do not think I measure my intellect against your book. I do not. I admit that your book is the growth of many ages; my intellect is but the offohoot of the age in which it is. But I do tell you what I do hope and dream of, if I do dream—that my thought, with many another man's intermarrying, and begetting a fruitful progeny of thoughts more powerful than the weak creed which is here, and which has kept itself alive by restrictions intolerant and atro¬ cious, and by penal laws directed against the advancement of humanity—I do hope that my thought, intermarrying with thought, and begetting herculean facts, may grapple with your faith, and hurl it down out of the way of struggling human kind</page><page sequence="130">126 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. whom it has branded. For myself, you have asked me of reason and of faith. Faith is like poison to the system. " I believe" crushes " I know." Faith is a cord around the neck of infant thought to strangle it; and I here impeach your faith, that it bandages man, that it stops his utterances, closes his eyes, crushes him to death; and I challenge my thought against your faith, and it shall rise up despite all the power that shall be employed against it. Mr. Barker :—If our faith crushes all thought and silences all tongues, how is it that there is more thought in Bible lands than in any other lands? How is it that there is more freedom of speech in this Christian, enlightened country, than in any other country in tho whole world, whether it be a heathen country, or whether it be bowed down beneath priestly supersti¬ tions For, I hold I am perfectly free to speak on this point, inasmuch as I told my friend the other night that I believed every Christian is a priest, and that there is no such thing as a class priesthood taught in the whole Bible—that is to say, iu the New Testament economy, which is the great guide for us. The New and Old Testaments concur in teaching that Judaism was but a temporary thing, intended to pass away and give place to something better at the suitable time. My friend says that I made an attempt—though, of course, a very unsuccessful one— to deal with his arguments and definitions. I admitted his de¬ finitions, and therefore why should he quarrel with me as to that But, as to his developing any secular teaching as arising out of those definitions, in distinction from the secular teaching which I, though a Christian, on my secular side of being also teach, I deny. That on which we join issue is, that while we stand side by side, and hold many things in common as taught us by reason and nature, he will go no further with me, and will not accept faith in her province, and give to her the legitimate sway which I hold it is utterly essential she should have. We have had a little touch again of Bible anomalies, in the shape of a homily, or an attempt at a homily, upon astronomy. Now, he is not going to diaw mo aside from the proposition in that way. I say again, that our proposition deals with the moral aspects of Christianity, and not with any peculiarities either of history, or any incidental remarks about science or geography, or anything of that kind. And then, again, my friend has veiy wonderfully confounded the Old Testament with the New in these matters; whereas we hold that the moral teachings of the New Testament are more perfect than the Old, for the Saviour often said, " Under the old economy</page><page sequence="131">FOURTH EVENING. 127 you were taught so and so. I teach you so and so ;" and the reason for the development and growth in the moral teachings of tho New Testament, in distinction to the Old, is just the same as I have referred to before, that Judaism, in all its branches and features, was never designed to be anything but temporary and local—a partial thing—introductory to that which was to be the absolute, perfect, and final. And yet, mark you, while I so speak of the Old Testament, there is no man who loves it better, or be¬ lieves more sincerely that in it are to be found—as I think I shall prove to-night befoi-e I have done with you—-the most glorious forebodings and intimations of that perfect system of morals found in the New Testament, by which we are prepared to stand or fall as Christian men. With regard to the Bible not teaching a man to keep his wife, I say the Bible teaches that he who does not provide for his own house—which, I suppose, includes his wife, or else I should like to know what does—is worse than an infidel! So that the old book is fair after all, for it gives a sort of comparative goodness to the infidel; and that is about all, I think, he ought to have. My friend says I reason fallaciously. AArell, but, according to his definition of reason, namely, that it is a certain phase of nature " operant," how can I do otherwise AVhy does he not try to alter my constitution, so that I may reason as correctly as he does? But, if human reason is subject to that anomaly, when, and where, and how will you gain one standard ?—and the stand¬ ard must be one, or it is worthless to guide man in his moral actions. If even two men cannot come together under the ope¬ ration of this " phase of nature operant'' without being always at loggerheads and disputing, how can you expect the thousands to come up to your standard, and acknowledge the one system of religion. My friend says he does not measure my old book by his thought. I fancied he had been doing that all the while. Upon my word, I cannot understand what else it is, when you are always criticising and finding fault with it! If that is not setting up your mind as a judge in the matter, I should like to know what it is My friend opens the book for the purpose of judging it; I appeal to it for the purpose of defending it. The prisoner at the bar appeals to the judge, and his advocate appeals to the judge for him, to prove his case all right, and his person and character innocent. But the judge, the inexorable judge, and impartial jury, find him, according to the laws of the book, guilty. And I find my friend guilty of a fallacy to-night, from the beginning to the end of both his speeches. That is all. I have no other charge against him. I believe he is a good fel-</page><page sequence="132">128 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. low—a thorough good fellow, no doubt; but his reasoning is utterly fallacious, or else mine is, one or the two. Now I am going a step further. I cannot be put out of my course. It is only a part of the development of my reason, and therefore ho must forgive me! I am going to show that the best intellects of the world have admitted the necessity of some higher teaching than nature and reason can give. I think I can do that in a very few words, if I turn to an author I have here, than whose book I would not sooner recommend to any one—I speak advisedly-—not because I think there are not better books, but 1 do not know that there is a better book to suit my friend in his present " stage of development,"—because he is only in a deve¬ loping stage, remember ; that is his own confession. Secularism is not a thing that is, it is only " what wants to be." I refer to the " Religion of Nature Delineated." Of course, he will be able to do without the Bible then, if he is not now ; and, when he has read that, he will be able to judge of the Bible, if he does not now. It is AVollaston's book, and there is not a more clever production in the world in print. [" How do you know ?"] Oh, my reason tells me so. After he has written 398 pages upon this subject, he says, " Here I begin to be very sensible how much I want a guide; but, as the religion of nature is my theme, I must at present content myself with that light which nature affords. My business being, as it seems, only to show what a heathen philo¬ sopher, without any other help, may be supposed to think, I hope that neither the doing this, nor anything else contained in this delineation, can bo the least prejudice to any true religion. AVhatever is immediately revealed from God "—(he does not pro¬ fess to say whether in the Bible, or the Koran, or anywhere else; and that is what I do not profess to say to-night. I will stick to my proposition, as far as I understand it)—" whatever is revealed from God must be treated as being what it is; and should be of itself and by itself treated with the highest regard, believed and obeyed." Now Spurzheim, on Christianity, says, in page 196 of his book—and he writes like other naturalists; a clever fellow, too; I have read this book many years ago with a great deal of interest—he says on Christianit)', after having pleaded for its necessity:—"There are two principal parts of it, tho one the marvellous, and the other the moral." After describing the marvellous, which is not necessary just now, he says that " Christian morality consists in this, the whole of it is reducible to two great commandments, ' Love God with all your heart and soul, and love your neighbour as yourself.'" Then he says,</page><page sequence="133">FOURTH EVENING. 129 " Christian morality, in commanding love to God, implies in this entire submission to the will of the Creator." Does it not Yes. The conviction of the extent and importance of this command is of prime necessity. That, " the will of the Father, God, is to be done in earth as it is done in heaven, is an injunction clearly set forth. The propriety of distinguishing between the laws of God and actions of man is thus precluded." AVe find such men as Locke and Newton—quite as strong lovers of natuie as my friend, or any other naturalist—acknowledging the necessity, after the most patient inquiry into the nature of things, for a reve¬ lation ; bowing down their mighty intellects after all to the old book, with all its imperfections, and agreeing to acknowledge that the very things which are stumbling-stones with my friend are but like so many spots on the sun's disc, which, after all, do not bide his shining, and can only, by a sort of telescopic infi¬ delity, be made known or revealed to man, and even then not practically to affect his condition. The condition of the heathen world, without morality, is another proof of what I have to say. I fancy Plato was perhaps as good an authority on these matters as either of us. I am quite willing to say a greater, in matters of mere nature, than I am. I am always happy to sit down at his feet as a naturalist and man of more reason, and learn all I can. Now, he says in his "Dialogues," page 132, something which may startle you:—" We must either learn the truth from others, or find it out ourselves," said one to him; " but if both means fail us amid all human reason, we must pitch upon the strongest and most forcible, and trust to that as to a ship while we pass through this stormy sea; and endeavour to avoid its tempests and shoals till we find out the more firm shore—such as a promise or revelation—upon which we may happily accomplish the voyage of this life as in a vessel that knows no danger." I shall have further to show, from this same kind of quotation, that my position is at present unassailed. I will not say unassailable, the argument does not require it, though I believe it is unassailable. Iconoclast:—My friend has, to use a word which seems to have pleased him, "developed" a new phase of himself. He has preached ineffectively, evaded arguments not wisely, mis¬ quoted Scripture occasionally, and he has now striven to be funny, to make up for the other deficiencies of the debate. I do not know that I have any occasion to complain of this. He probably knows what is due to his own cause better G o</page><page sequence="134">130 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. than I do; and I will simply say that I hope he is taking the course best calculated to convince. But he has misappre¬ hended my intention. He says I charge him with reasoning fallaciously. I did not intend to have charged him with "reasoning" at all, and, if 1 did, I apologize for it. I thought I had endeavoured to show that he had miscomprehended the meaning of words entirely, and while he strove to be pleasant upon it he did not strive to reply. I thought to show that he had miscomprehended the meaning of words entirely. I have shown that he neglected so much of the argument as was affected by a right comprehension of those words. Now he tells you that he does not intend to be led off the subject. What is the subject " Does secularism afford a surer basis than Christianity, which rests on the Bible " [Mr. Barker:—"And does it?"] I am about to deal with both sides of the question. My friend, who feels the deficiency of the one side, is determined not to be led on to it, and he does very wisely ; because if he were once led on to it, the ground is so weak, and it offers a standing-point so slippery, that there would be no place by which my friend could hold. The only development, then, would be a development to the bottom, which would be as rapid as anybody could possibly wish. Now, I ask my friend what he means by telling me that the Old Testament was a temporary dispensation God did not say so. If he spoke at all, he told Solomon that the temple should durate for ever; that in it he should dwell for ever. He did not say a word to Abraham about the covenant being temporary; nor did Jesus hold the doctrine. What he did say—he used words which were expressive enough—was, "Think not that I am come to destroy the law and the prophets. I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil; for verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth shall pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." And yet my friend says that the Old Testament law is temporary. He admits that there are weak and bad points in it. Does he contradict Jesus, who says he did not come to take one jot or tittle off it, but to fulfil the whole of it AVhy does our friend say that the Old Testament is imper¬ fect, and the New Testament an improvement? Because the age has grown beyond it, and he knows that educated opinion is against it. But my friend has put a question to me. He says, " AA'hy is it, if faith destroys reason—if faith controls reason— that in Bible lands there is more reason than there is where the Bible does not so abound ?" I will endeavour to answer his</page><page sequence="135">FOURTH EVENING. 131 question. I will tell him that it is not because England is a Bible-believing land, but because it is a leading land; it is because people reason here; not because they believe, but be¬ cause they inquire and reject: and that the freedom in England has been achieved not by the Bible and Bible teaching, but in spite of the Bible and in spite of Bible teaching. There are men in Lancashire now, grey-headed men, who in their boyhood and youth had to meet to read such works as those by Thomas Paine in the centie of a field—the police having searched their houses for infidel books, dragged out of cupboards. AVhat has won the freedom you now have Not Christianity—not Christian preachers—but bold, brave men, who have lain in your Chris¬ tian dungeons year after year. AVould our friend before me who laughs have had the courage to do as the brave, the indo¬ mitable, the lion-hearted Richard Carlile did He was for nine years and nine months in Newgate ; in Giltspur-street; in many of the gaols of England; hunted down time after time; and he, and such as he, won for you the cheap press which you now boast of in your Bible-reading country. You ask about the Bible ; go to other countries not far from here where the Bible is more believed in than here, and see there what privileges they have—what freedom The Bible is not believed in in England Do you believe in witches In the reign of King James, Bible England did, and you burnt poor old women. AVhy to-day reason has triumphed over your Bible religion. Your Bible said, " Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live;" but humanity, stronger than your Bible, has refuted the barbarism which even your New Testament, improvement though it was, did not correct. AVhy, in Bible England slavery was part of the Bible institu¬ tions—part of the English institutions. Men were serfs and slaves to the soil when the Bible was as potent in England, and more potent, than at the present day. AVhat was freedom Not the Bible. AVhy, AVilliam AVilberforce, when moving the Com¬ mons House of Parliament for leave to bring in a bill to amend the law relating to AVest Indian slavery, was obliged to say that " infidelity, iniquity, and republicanism in France had given the negroes a freedom which Christianity in England denied." My friend is fond of quotations—let him turn to the Parliamentary Reports between this and the next debate, and he will there see that when laws have been brought in for the freeing of know¬ ledge, for the removal of taxes and restrictions, who have been the men to give knowledge to the people. Governor Berkeley Wrote from Virginia, when he was governor there, that free schools and printing were inventions of the devil to spread</page><page sequence="136">132 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. sedition and heresy among the people; and so strongly has this been felt, that barriers have been put in the way of education and advancement. I ask my friend how it is that to-night he dares to tell me, if this book is a revelation from God, that any one part of it is an improvement upon the other AVas God better educated in the New Testament than in the Old Had God improved, or did he give a worse revelation before than he should have done In the one case, he would be unjust, and not God; in the other case, he would be changing and imperfect, and not God. But I am surprised when my friend deals with the question in the manner in which he has done to-night, and tells me that the Bible has nothing whatever to do with the subject of to-night. There are two points put before us—one secularism, the other Christianity; and the question is, which of these two offers the surer basis p Our friend says, " Oh, I go with nature part of the way." You cannot go with nature at all. AVhat did Jesus tell you? Jesus said that you were not to take thought for what you should eat or drink, nor for wherewithal you were to be clothed. You are to seek first the kingdom of heaven and his righteousness, and all else shall be added to you. You yourselves preach the same doctrine, for you say that men are to love God first. Love God first! You cannot love a God who directs that you should put the wife of your bosom to death without mercy if she inclines to another faith. You cannot love a God who behaved as the God of the Bible has done. My friend would not attempt to defend the rascality of Jacob, whom God loved; and yet he would ask me to love a God who loved Jacob and hated Esau, who was the better man of the two. How can I believe what he asks me to believe He told us in his last speech, " Here is my basis, lovo to God and then love to man " I tell you," Here is my basis—here, wide existence: gather from it, and as you gather give; and in your giving and in your gathering you build up thoughts that will serve you in your course of life." He has read several extracts; I will take the opportunity of reading two or three which seem remarkably pertinent to this question. I am reading from a letter of Mr. Atkinson's. He says, " It seems to me there are three principal fundamental forms of moral life : active humanity—industry in acquiring knowledge—honesty in imparting what we know. It is one of the highest duties of man to learn to know himself, and, secondly, to allow himself to be known ; but the contendings of false systems in the world are the greatest hindrance to sim¬ plicity of character and to moral growth." And here is the " bitterness " of our " baseness," if I may so express it—we</page><page sequence="137">FOURTH EVENING. 133 appeal to existence — our friend to petty revelations. AVhy there are a thousand sects with their petty revelations saying each is better than all; and better must we be who appeal to the great whole, and ask you to gather from the whole the gems and jewellery of truth that make us rich indeed. Our friend puts his system side by side with mine, and speaks of mine as though I borrowed from his. He says that I tell you that I am but of to-day; and he complains that I do not put it to you that my system is finished, and can take in no more. If I did it would be no sure basis, because each day we are discovering new facts, and with each fact we are getting a better grasp of the mighty system, the end of the whole which is the attainment of the happiness of human kind. I ask him to tell us how it is, if his system offers a surer basis for human conduct, that it has not made the world better than it is He talks of Bible England! How is it that there is trickery, fraud, poverty, misery, inhu¬ manity in Bible England now? It is because even yet the education of the people has only removed some of the falsehoods of priestcraftism. It was Bible England when a corrupt govern¬ ment and a licentious priesthood overrun the land—when the people had no political rights. Step by step they have been won, despite your Bible. Every new institution has been erected in opposition to it—every mechanics' institution—every paper that developed new truths found its opposition from your church. You tell me that you are here against priestcraft, and that you have no priests. Your Old Testament establishes them, and you well know that the New Testament does not condemn it. My friend said that the Bible makes no priests, and he would have none ; but he amended his phrase by saying that the New Testa¬ ment makes none. You tear the Bible in halves, and one half you say is abrogated; but I tell you that the other half is as incoherent, and that, with its hell fire, it frightens men away from any basis at all. AVhat is your basis " Bo good, and I will reward you ; be good, or I will burn you." AVhat is ours AVe have no priests to drive you away; we have no hell fire to frighten you. AVe do not offer heaven by-and-by; but we say develop yourselves to the fullest, act out yourselves to the fullest, and in each good act done—each good thought outspoken—you have your own heaven and your own reward; and in the doing of it you make your own Judgment. One word more, and I have done. Our friend and I have now gone through four nights of this debate. Two more remain. Instead of challenging me to meet him again, let him leave no question unanswered in this debate, but grapple point by point</page><page sequence="138">134 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. with my objections ; because I tell him, frankly and fearlessly, that he does not answer because he cannot—that he avoids because he dare not. Mr. Barker :—AAre have had a little secular intelligence to-night in respect as to cheap literature and a cheap press. I thought that Kenwick set up the first cheap press, and not Carlile. However, we get corrected in these little matters! He says, that nowhere does God say anything about his putting away the Old Testament dispensation as temporary. I say there are several passages directly bearing upon that in the Epistle to the Hebrews. AVe find in the ninth chapter of that epistle that the first covenant had ordinances of Divine service, and a worldly sanctuary. AAre find in the tenth chapter that these were put away, because they were but shadows. " For the law," Paul says, in the first verse of that chapter, " having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect" He says, in the eighth chapter and last verse, " In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away." My friend wants to know why it is that England has a superior standing, intellectually and morally, among the nations. He says it is because England is a reading nation. I deny that that is the reason. It is only a part of the cause, and the very feeblest part of it, too. China is a reading nation to a greater extent than England—I challenge denial—and that, too, with a language that has eighty thousand characters in it. Every third man in China can read his own tongue. I say that upon the highest possible authority. But mark you, China does not read what England reads. She has not the means of getting at the knowledge which England has of the old book, and its moral principles. I want to know who won for you your Reform bills-—secularists or Christians [A Voice :— "Chartists."] Chartists, was it Well, then you have amongst the Chartists some of the best possible Christian men in the country. AVho laid the foundation for the liberty of the slave Not the persons referred to ; nor was it the fact of our imitating France. The argument of AVilberforee was simply to show that, when we had so much better a form of morality, we ought not to be behind France on the question of slavery. The fact is, that while we have put away slavery, under the influence of Wilberforce and Knibb—both of them Christian men—France still retains slavery in a certain sense, and does all she can to make us do the same, too, in regard to it. I do not see anything else in that speech</page><page sequence="139">FOURTH EVENING. 135 which requires an answer. Oh, yes; there is one other point, and it is this. He asks why it was that God gave a better revelation in the new dispensation than in the old. AVas it that God had grown better Now, he knows very well that I gave him my views on this subject on the first night. Man was, so to speak, in his childhood, as a race, during the old dispensation; and I ask him whether he would put a scientific book into the hands of a little child before he has learned the alphabet I defy him to refute that principle. Humanity has grown, and is growing; but she grows fastest and best where she has an open Bible. AVith regard to the old heathens, the secularism of the heathen world put such men as Socrates to death—the reformers of their day, according to the light they had; and it is the secular element in connexion with the so-called Christian church that has put men to death in reference to a Christian revelation. It is the humanizing, the secularizing of that Christianity—which in itself is holy, and beneficent, and pure—that has led men to the stake in any period, or in connexion with any event; and I am not so sure, notwithstanding all my friend has written to the contrary, in explanation, as he thinks, of the causes and character of the French Revolution—I am not so sure that that revolution itself was not a fearful instance in which human life was said to be only the " diverting of a few drops of blood into another current," causing so many thousands to die in the Reign of Terror. Here is something for my friend to answer. Eight hundred years before the Christian era commenced, and its glorious doc¬ trines were promulgated in their New Testament forms, their characteristics were unfolded, and the beneficial influence they should have upon society was declared. He has got to deal with that. It is in the Old Testament—that wonderful, nasty old book. In the forty-second chapter of the prophecies of Isaiah we are told, respecting the Messiah, in the first verse, " He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles." Is our condition to-day better than that of our old Druidical fathers, if you please It was said he should not fail nor be discouraged; implying that there would be great difficulties in connexion with the establish¬ ment and perfection of that scheme of truth and judgment for mankind. " He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law." It is said, that he should " open the blind eyes, and bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in daikness out of the prison house." In the sixteenth verse, it is said, " I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness</page><page sequence="140">136 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them." If my friend would come to the discussion of some such points as this in the AVord of God, instead of raking up that which he thinks to be obsolete and improper, we should then be able to see very soon whether the positive teachings of Christianity, side by side with the positive teachings of secularism—which I cannot see at all yet—are to be preferred as better than the positive teachings of secularism, which we have never yet had, but which we are all to find out for ourselves as soon as we can, and do without them till we can ; a singular sort of process that for humanity. AVith regard to the condition of the old nations which had not this old book with its naughtiness. If you will turn to the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, you will find there a description of humanity, as to its vileness and iniquity, enough to rend any heart to think of; and I defy any man, with ancient history in his hand, to show that one single charge brought against the family of man in its secular condition was untrue, or is even untrue to-day, as far as the secular aspects of humanity are con¬ cerned. You find there that all their moral powers were so deteriorated, that they came to worship beasts and insects and noisome things, having first of all changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the image of corruptible man, ere the intellect could be sufficiently darkened, or the moral sense sufficiently deadened, to permit of man—who in his original condition is majestic, and may come back to be more ma¬ jestic—doing such things. Turn to 1 Cor., the first chapter. There you have a description of man's boasted intelligence and wisdom. Paul was speaking to a proud, imperious people, in one of the most fashionable and most licentious cities in the old R.oman world, namely, Corinth. It was a Grecian city; but it was under the Roman power at that time. Paul, in discussing the question of wisdom, says that the time was now come when Jehovah, by this simple gospel—which to the Jew was a stum¬ bling-block, because of his silly old prejudices, and to the Greeks and heathen at large, in their pretensions to wisdom, was folly— would prove that its weakness and folly was stronger than the power and wisdom of man, and was the power of God to salvation to every soul that should believe it. And what for That no flesh should glory in his presence. Ah! that is the thing my friend does not like. You are not to love God first, and man second. What for If there be a God at all—I shall not open the question—is it improper to love him first instead of second I am asking about the propriety of the thing we are talking about</page><page sequence="141">FOURTH EVENING. 137 —morality not faith, not dogmas. When I come to dogmas I will deal with them. And I say, that from the commencement of the age of letters, in the early periods of the old world, unto this moment, you shall not find me a guide to morals relating to man and God, and man and man, as complete, as simple, and, at the same time, as unwavering, as the guide to morals in the Bible. Do you complain that Christianity is imperious in setting up a definite, fixed, and an unchanging scheme of morality? Her imperiousness arises from the consciousness on the part of her teachers of the absolute unity and oneness between all they re¬ quire and the best interests of man. If I see a man standing on the verge of a precipice, is it not time to be imperious, if I can thereby snatch him backwards into a position of safety It is no time for dilettanti ; it is no time for mere inquiry and questioning as to how deep the precipice is. He stands on a platform, on the verge, upon rotten timbers only, and I see them every moment creaking; but whenever have you known the broad foundations of Christianity creak I have seen the systems of men hurled against them. I have seen the power of the sword, of the intel¬ lect, the enmity of the heart, the vices of the life, and of all humanity, in one form or another, hurled against the foundations of Biblo morality; but they stand to-day prouder than over. And there is not a conscience here to-night, not even a secularist's conscience, which does not feel that if there be a God, he deserves to be loved ; and that to love God with all the heart, and all the soul, and all the mind, and with all the strength, and man as yourselves, is the highest system of morality. Do you not see the triangular aspect of morality—the man, his God, his neighbour. There you have the threefold bearing of every moral question. But secularism cannot give you its threefold bearings; and yet it is impossible to separate these three aspects of morality from a mind like man's. AVithout this love to God, no man can be happy here; nor, if there be an hereafter, can he be happy there. The Umpire then announced the subject of discussion for the Tuesday following, and the meeting separated; after a vote of thanks had been passed to him for his impartial conduct. L</page><page sequence="142">FIFTH NIGHT'S DISCUSSION. TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1862. Subject :—Is the plan of Salvation through the Atonement repulsive in its details, immoral in its tendency, and unworthy of the acceptance of the human race Mr. Barker :—According to [the wording of our proposition, you will see that there are several things connected with the doctrine of the atonement which I, as a Christian, might dis¬ course upon, which have no direct reference to our proposition this evening. I might, for instance, try to explain how the atonement is brought to bear on some theory of my own, or on that of some Christian teacher or leader. I shall not attempt that to-night. I^might enter into the question of how far the atonement has been and is to be efficient as to the great end which it has in view; and what it is which makes it efficient, in one case or in any number of cases ; and why it is not efficient in all cases where the knowledge of it has come to mankind. But these questions are beside the mark. I have simply to do with the broad, open question, whether the plan of salvation through the atonement is repulsive in its details, immoral in its tendency, and unworthy of the acceptance of the human race I shall commence my remarks upon that subject this evening by stating that I believe there are two great truths in the Word of God which stand out in bold relief beyond all others. The atonement is one of them, as the means by which man's sin against God is to be forgiven. The doctrine of a Divine re¬ generation, or a new birth, is tho other. I find these two doctrines asserted, in some form or other, from the earliest period in which God began religiously to instruct our race, and to show</page><page sequence="143">FIFTH EVENING. 139 to fallen man the way of salvation; although the first intimations, and the first information, too, respecting these two truths were far less distinct than that which has been afforded to us in more recent times, and in the more perfect development of Divine truth as contained in the Scriptures. I think I see, too, how all the providential dealings of God with mankind have had reference to the evolving and making manifest of these two truths, in order that their importance might be felt by man ; and that he, by acknowledging them and receiving them, might derive the benefit which they are calculated to bring to him. I think I perceive, too, from ancient history, that the divergencies which the human mind has made from the course of truth, as at first made known traditionally, and in types and shadows, have had a direct reference to these two truths. I see in every heathen altar, on which a bleeding sacrifice of an imperfect or improper kind has been offered, a perverted representation on the part of those who have reared those altars of the great doctrine of sacri¬ fice as contained in the AVord of God. I find in the mythologies of the heathen world—take the Indian, for instance, the doctrines connected with the Brahmiuical system—a direct perversion of the doctrine of the new birth, a Divine Sonship for man in the Christ, instead of the sonship which he lost in Adam. If a Christian missionary goes to a Brahmin now, and preaches the Gospel, one of the fust objections the Brahmin offers to the doctrine is this, not that merely it is new, but that it is unnecessary. If you explain the doctrine of the atonement, as contained in the New Testament, he says, " God is in everything; God is in me, and I am part of God ; that which I do is done by God; how can I then be a sinner I do not need, therefore, that my sin should be atoned for and put away. I am descended from God ; I am his son, his child. I do not need, therefore, your doctrine of a new and Divine Sonship." I find in the establishment of the Jewish economy as a typical dispensation, an effort on the part of God—wisely made, beautifully compact in all its parts—to restore to the human mind, when it had lost it, a knowledge of these two truths ; and these, by a series of types and shadows, by a series of ordinances and appointed institutions, prepare the way for the full development of the truth of these two points when Christ himself should come: who was to be—as far as his character and life were concerned—the embodiment and representation of the one, and in his death was to accomplish the other. I am, however, to-night to speak of the atonement. Let me, then, in a few words, as briefly as possible, first of all show what things were necessary, as far as I understand the Scriptures, to</page><page sequence="144">140 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. constitute a true and proper atonement for sin, such as we believe we have revealed to us in the AVord of God. The first thing necessary was, that in connexion with that atonement there should be the maintenance of the sanctions of the Divine law— that law which man has broken. AVe find, therefore, in the Scriptures, such assertions as the following:—" All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God " (Rom. iii. 23). We find Christ sa3'ing, in his teachings, " I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil." Mark you, the moral law is that of which ho is speaking in that passage, and not the ceremonial; and I beg my friend, when he rises to speak, not to confound tho two again. It is to be remembered, then, that the moral law was to be sustained by Christ's life, and honoured by Christ's death; and, being thus maintained, a way was to bo prepared by the death of Christ for the exercise of mercy to the children of men, who, according to the testimony of Scripture, have all sinned, and come short of God's glory. Jesus was therefore spoken of by the prophet Isaiah (lxii. 21) as a person to come, who should " magnify the law and make it honourable." There was only one alternative to this plan, namely, that the justice of God should take its course, that no atonement should be made for man; but this alternative would not have been in harmony with the benevolence and mercy of the Divine character as we find it traced in the Word of God. In making this remark, however, we confine its force purely to the sons of men. The second thing requisite was that there should be a consistent exercise of Divine mercy, that God should not show mercy at the expense of his righteousness and justice, as the moral Governor of the world— that he should not do it in such a manner as to render it possible that his own sincerity should be questioned when he speaks of the evil of sin and of the sanctions of the Divine law in relation to sin—that he should bring his mercy to men, so that angels above, and fallen spirits beneath, might be constrained, although from different motives, in the two different cases, to recognise that, while God was just, ho could bo the justifier of him that should believe in Jesus Christ. Tho third thing requisite was that salvation should be possible to mankind at large. With these three general requisites, I pass on to define what I moan by the doctrine of the atonement. I mean this, that the sufferings and death of Christ constitute that atonement; that it is the means of our reconciliation to God, and that there is no other means of our securing that fellowship with God, or adoption into his</page><page sequence="145">FIFTH EVENING. 141 family, which the moral nature of man is adapted for, and which would comprise the highest state of perfection of that moral nature. I enter no further upon that, but come to a few observations respecting several aspects of Christ as the Atoning Sacrifice, as he comes before us in the Scriptures. My first remark is this—that the grand object of his incarnation was to accomplish this work. I do not say he had no other object in view by taking upon himself our nature. I have alreadv asserted that he had. But if there be any difference between the two main objects of his coming, this was the chief one—the primary one; this was of first and absolute importance; and I call upon you to note one circumstance connected with Christ, as his character is described in the Scriptures—namely, that Jesus Christ was born for the express purpose of dying. You cannot say that of man, though he is a sinner exposed to death. Death is a penal thing to him, and I am prepared to defend that at all cost, because I know precisely what the sentiment is worth, and what the objections against it are worth. But with regard to Christ; he never would have been the Christ, in the Scripture sense of the phrase, but that he came to die. If this statement be looked upon as some wild theory, let us turn to the AVord of God. In tho 40th Psalm, you have Christ speaking by the mouth of David, as a prophet, concerning the fact that a body had been prepared him for the very purpose which I have now specified. If there be any doubt of its application to the Messiah, because it is quoted from the Old Testament, and one of David's psalms, come to the tenth chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and there you will find the Apostle Paul, an inspired teacher of Christianity, endorsing the statement as a Divine record, directly bearing upon the great theme of Christ's incarnation. If this fact be noted, we shall be prepared to find, in subsequent features of his character, some things which are entirely unique; which stand alone in relation to him, and have no connexion with man¬ kind at large; although he has taken upon himself our flesh, our nature, in such a sense as to make himself one with us, yet still he is not one in that respect. I find this doctrine further laid down in the second chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, where we are told that, because the children were partakers of flesh and blood, he likewise took part of the same ; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death; that he might taste death for every man ; and that thus, by the tasting of death, he might bring many sons home to glory.</page><page sequence="146">142 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. I pass now to another remark respecting this feature of Christ's character. If we look at the constitution of his person, we shall find that it is eminently adapted to answer this important end. AArhat was that end? To come to mediate between God and fallen man. There are two parties therefore concerned in this mediation ; God the all-wise, glorious, and merciful; and man the finite, the sinful, the erring, the guilty, the necessitous. Now, no mere man could represent the whole of this case; and Deity in the abstract could not have represented the whole of this case. We have in Christ, therefore, a model person, God and mam according to the teachings of the Scriptures—prophetic intimations on the one hand considered, and New Testament declarations taken into account on the other; so that when Christ was representing man to God, the human aspect of his character stands out before us in bold relief; and when Christ was repre¬ senting God to man, the Deity of his nature stands out in bold relief; and when he fulfils the work of his mediation, as an atoning sacrifice, the blended force and influence of the Divine and of tho human are said, in the Scriptures, to constitute the virtue or the power of that sacrifice ; for he, through the Eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot unto God; a sacrifice holy and acceptable, without spot or blemish. The things requisite to make an atonement will now occupy my attention for a moment. First, the appointment of the person who should atone could only proceed from head-quarters, if we may so speak—namely, from God the Father. Therefore we find the Scriptures represent to us that " God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John iii. 16). AVo find Paul saying, Rom. v. 8, " God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." But this is not all. The person who comes to atone must be not a mere instrument, not a mere agent, but he must be in him¬ self a willing party to this engagement; he must himself have a right and prerogative in the accomplishment of this great work, and therefore the New Testament Scriptures are equally explicative in their declarations of Christ's love to us as well as of the love of the Father to us in giving his Son. But then there is a third thing to mention, and that third thing is this, that in order that he should be a competent mediator, he must be himself spotlessly holy. He must be himself without blame; separate from sinners. Paul says, " Therefore such an</page><page sequence="147">FIFTH EVENING. 143 high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners" (Heb. vii. 26). Now, if the character of Christ be carefully traced, as given in the Scriptures, wo shall find that in all respects what we have stated is more than substantiated. The evidence upon each point is, indeed, redundant. It has been said, even by some professing Christians, that we may be saved by the example of Christ; that we have but to copy his example, to con¬ form our lives to his doctrine—to seek to be good, and true, and pure, and humble as he was—and that is all-sufficient; we are in a saved condition, and are certain of everlasting felicity. I demur myself, of course, to this statement; and any gentlemen who think differently upon the matter to myself will still feel that I have a perfect right to state my views on this occasion. I cannot see that the mere example of the Lord Jesus Christ could qualify him alone to be to me the Saviour which the wants of my nature require. In many things he was inimitable. In his miracles and other features of his character—except in cases where there was a special commission given, as in the case of the apostles, when they were empowered by him to work miracles in his name; and they never ventured to attempt these miraculous works_without invoking that name. There are some things, too, in which his example could have had no share in the plan of salvation. All those Old Testament worthies who died in faith —of whom a somewhat remarkable list is given in the 11th of Hebrews—although they are "only given as specimens of a large class of persons during the old economy—what influence could his example have had upon those who had never seen him, never witnessed his life, nor heard his teachings And yet he has been declared to have been tho redemption for the transgressions under the first covenant or economy ; and therefore tho example of Christ alone is inadequate to constitute him a perfect Saviour. If we were saved by his example, salvation must be restricted to those who should perfectly copy it. If that were the rule of salvation, an imperfect imitation of Christ could not answer; it could not raise us up to that standard of character which would be required of us, and salvation would be impossible. On this account, therefore, we feel that God in mercy has constituted Christ so that while his example shall have an influence on all believers, tending to their purification and holiness according to the new-born nature that is within them, at tho same time there should have been a vicarious aspect in some part of his character—either in his obedience, or in his death, or in both—in order that in the sight of a completely spotless God, and</page><page sequence="148">144 MODERN ATHEISM AND TnE BIBLE. of a holy and just law, men may stand righteous in the sight of God. There are other views of the death of Christ which we may briefly glance at, namely, that it ratified the covenant of salvation which God made with man through him. But I cannot see how it could ratify the covenant made with man through him, except with a direct reference to his sufferings and his death; for I will show you just now that those sufferings which have reference to the atonement for sin are not merely distinguishable in the New Testament from his life and actions, but from many of his suffer¬ ings, too—those of his sufferings which are never mentioned in connexion with the putting away of man's transgressions by him. Then it would have been impossible that the mere life of Christ apart from his death could have laid the foundation for our salva¬ tion in this way. Dying is a poor proof of a doctrine. If Christ had lived among us until now, manifesting the glory of his own deity, and of his own eternity, and the purity and excellence of his own character, I apprehend it would have been quite as influ¬ ential in the way of example upon mankind as the simple fact of his dying to bear testimony to the truth he preached. AVe are sometimes told that Jesus suffered death as a martyr, and that we cannot find, therefore, any atoning element in his death. But did not John the Baptist die as a martyr And we have not a reli¬ gious teacher in the same age sustaining a closer relationship to Christ—his harbinger and messenger, preparing his way before him. Did he not gather about him disciples? Ay, there are followers of him to this day in the Eastern world; but never in the whole of the Scriptures, nor even in the most remote sense, do we find the salvation of man is attributed to the influence of John or his teaching; and yet I am prepared to show that John taught those two great truths which distinguish Christianity—the Divino atonement for human transgression, and the necessity for a hea¬ venly birth in order to fit men for the kingdom of God. We see, therefore—at least, we think we do—that if there bo salvation for mankind at all in Jesus Christ, the connecting point between the Saviour and tho saved, as far as the efficiency of the one, and the dependence upon that efficiency of the other, is concerned, is in the death rather than in the life of Christ. And we shall there¬ fore to-night, if true to our proposition, have to confine ourselves to that one feature of Christ's character, that he gave himself for our sins according to the Scriptures, and died on the cross for that purpose; that he agonized in the garden of Gcthsemane,</page><page sequence="149">F1FIH EVENING. 115 submitting to the pains of the Cross, simply and exclusively that he might open up a fountain for sin and uncleanness, in which men might find pardon, and purity also, in the sight of a holy and righteous God. I shall direct your attention to some of the sufferings of Christ, in reference to which there is not a word said about their saving efficacy. Christ was a sufferer for the truth's sake; that we know. He suffered in the following ways :—He endured great travail of soul for the truth's sake. The zeal of the Lord of hosts had eaten him up. He was anxious about his Father's business. He went about doing good, toiling—anxiously toiling—in the midst of that great and arduous work. But nowhere between the two covers of the Bible will you find that salvation is attributed to his toiling, to his anxiety for the truth's sake. The Saviour had also to bear the indifference of his own friends and associates in refer¬ ence to this great matter; but we nowhere find that the fact of his disciples deserting him or misunderstanding him, or not fully sympathizing with him in his sufferings, has any reference at all to the efficiency of those sufferings in relation to our salvation. He himself directly disavowed that thought when he told them that it was impossible they should suffer with him in the atone¬ ment he was about to make for sin, and showed them he had a baptism to be baptized with which they would not be able to endure, although they thought they were. And the circumstances very speedily showed that not one of them—and not simply not Peter—but not one of them, was able to watch with him one single hour in those mysterious, and, at the same time, merciful sufferings which he bore in the Garden and on the Cross, We find again that the Saviour endured the contempt and cruelty of his enemies until he was actually put to death by them. But the efficacy of the sufferings of Christ is nowhere in tho Scriptures traced to the fact that men crucified him, but to the fact that God intended that his voluntary submission to that crucifixion should constitute the \irtue of his sufferings. Therein is the atonement for our sin. AAre are told, again, that Jesus Christ suffered death for the truth's sake. So ho did; but it was in the fact that he, in con¬ nexion with his Father in heaven, on man's behalf, had united in the one great, merciful, and holy purpose of making such a manifestation of the Divine displeasure against sin—the aversion of God to impurity and uncleanness—before the world. Such a manifestation of Divine mercy, too, that Jesus, by his grief in the H</page><page sequence="150">146 MODERN ATHEISM AND TnE BIBLE. Garden—making, as Isaiah says of him, his soul an offering for sin—and his pains on the cross, in the vicarious death he died, became a true and proper atonement for our transgressions; so much so, that we are told that " without the shedding of blood there is no remission" of sin; and that we have, by the grace of God in him, salvation and redemption, even the forgiveness of our sins through his sufferings and his death. This is the great theme which we are this evening to dwell upon. These are the positions which I have come here to main¬ tain, and to show to this audience that there is nothing repulsive, that there is nothing immoral, that there is nothing injurious to man in this truth; but that, on the contrary, it is highly con¬ ducive to his best interests, temporal and eternal, and that it will in the end manifest most fully and completely the glory of God in all his character and attributes. Iconoclast:—The question for this evening, I should think, had partially escaped the memory of some of you during the speech to which we have just had the opportunity of listening; and I will, therefore, take the liberty of repeating it at the opening of mine. "Is the plan of salvation through the atone¬ ment repulsive in its details, immoral in its tendency, and un¬ worthy of the acceptance of the human race?" AVhat are the details of the atonement? Our friend, while talking vaguely about the whole scheme of the atonement, has avoided, it seems to me, its details as much as it is possible for any man to do. I shall endeavour, then, following out the wording of the question, to see what are the details of the plan of salvation through the atonement. I shall then endeavour to ascertain vhat is the tendency of that plan; and to see whether tho plan, with its details, is worthy or unworthy of our acceptance. The details of the plan of salvation through the atonement are to bo found in this book (the Bible); and, as I understand the plan, it is first laid before us in what our friend is pleased to term the cere¬ monial law. He has told us that, when Jesus said that he came to fulfil the law and not to destroy it—when he used the lan¬ guage which it was my duty to quote to you on a previous evening—" Think not that I am come to destroy the law and the prophets; I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil"—our friend says, that Jesus uttered that with a limited meaning—that he only meant the moral law, and not tho ceremonial law. AVill he be kind enough to find me one word, in the whole of the</page><page sequence="151">FIFTH EVENING. 147 teachings of Jesus, that can fairly justify us in so limiting the text And will he next tell me how I am to distinguish between a ceremonial ordinance and a moral ordinance Is " Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain," ceremonial or moral Our friends on the platform, some of them dhines, ministers, preachers of the faith, can afford to laugh at a question so trivial and absurd; and they can afford to laugh so indecently and loudly, as to allow it to come to my ears. [One of the gentlemen on the platform said that the speaker was mistaken.] I will put the question to them and to their representative so forcibly, before I have done, as shall leave little room for laughter. AVas it a ceremonial or a moral injunction— and this will bear very much upon the doctrine of the atonement —when we are told in the law of Leviticus," None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death"? AA"as human sacrifice a ceremonial or a moral injunction? AVill our friend tell me what he makes of it? I should make of it something very immoral, however uttered, whenever uttered, and in whatever manner it might have been put forth. AVas the injunction as to the observance of the Sabbath-day a moral or a ceremonial injunction Which are moral and which ceremonial laws AVere the laws as to slavery moral or ceremonial AVere the laws as to stealing women, robbing them of their virtue, and turning them out into the wide world, whether they would or not, moral or ceremonial Cere¬ monial, certainly not. Then, if Jesus came to enforce tho moral, he- came to enforce that most immoral injunction which you may find in Deuteronomy. Our friend has it to deal with. I pass it by, because it is not part of my purpose; and I only mention it because my friend himself provokes it by his opening challenge. AVhat are the details of the scheme of atonement They aro these :— God finds man sinning. God is the source of all events; the event sin finds its origin in the same source. God is the origin of everything—of good and of evil. God is dissatisfied with the existence of evil. God is dissatisfied that man commits sin; and our friend has told you—and mark this, for in that phrase he put tho whole force of his speech—that without the shedding of blood there shall be no remission of sin. It is true, according to Christianity, that without tho shedding of blood there shall be no remission of sin. The shedding of blood is its chief feature, which goes through the whole of its history, and makes it re¬ pulsive to us to-night. Man commits sin. In the earliest age H2</page><page sequence="152">148 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. we have sacrifices. Cain and Abel sacrifice, and the sacrifice found acceptable is the bloody sacrifice—the sacrifice of blood. "AVithout tho shedding of blood theio shall be no remission of sin." And when there were only two people in the world beside our first parents, if the Bible be true, the only acceptable sacrifice which a God of love and mercy could find delight in was the bloody carcase of an animal having no part or share in man's offence; and, if our friend be right, impassably separated from him—the one having a soul—the one having a free will, according to our friend's notion—and tho other having nothing of the kind. And yet the one is made the atonement for the other. In the 16th chapter of Leviticus, you have this horrid doctrine most fully laid down. I will read it to you. In the 5th verse, it says, " He shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering. And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house." Ono goat is sacrificed. One " scapegoat " bears away the sins of the people out into the desert. I will read it. AVe are told, " Aaron shall lay his hands upon the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness : and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited : and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness. And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which ho put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there: and he shall wash his flesh with water in tho holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering, and the burnt-offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for tho people." Ileie you have the doctrine of tho atonement, as laid down in Leviticus. Our friend talked a great deal of life and death. How did the goat live that was an atonement for the Jews How did he die Lived and died—the life of the goat. It was the goat that was an atonement for the Jews. God in high heaven, desiring that the fallen spirits below—how do you know that they are below, and whore below?-—and that tho angels above—where above, and what do you mean by angels above, and what do you know of them ?—desiring that they shall not find fault with him nor make remarks about him—-not from justice, not from mercy, not from love, only that they shall not</page><page sequence="153">FIFTH EVENING. 149 have any room for backbiting or slander, direct. This is the great scheme of the atonement as put before you to-night. God, in high heaven directs that there shall be two goats, one of them killed and the other turned out alive into the desert, with the whole sins of the nation upon its back—a scapegoat to make atonement for the people. I do not invent this. I find it in Leviticus; and I assert that the plan of salvation by an atoning sacrifice is repulsive in its details. I argue that it is immoral in its tendency; and I argue that it is unacceptable to the human race. If there be a God, what atonement could there be to him in the taking two goats, burning one of them, and turning the other out into the desert What atonement for a people ?— what atonement for their wrong doing? And yet this is the scheme of atonement as first planned out. Oh! but my friend did not come here to talk about that. That is ceremonial, he will tell you by and by. He came to talk about the grand moral atonement. Well, we will pass the ceremonial, and we will go to the moral—the atonement by Jesus. He has dwelt very little upon the details of that, but ho has told you that Jesus was fore¬ told in the 40th Psalm; and then it seemed to occur to him that there might be a difficulty in finding Jesus in the 40th Psalm. By the way, he told us it was written by David. I am not quite sure ; will he be kind enough to give us some verification of that statement, when he rises again. AVill he tell me where David wrote—what language he wrote in—and how his writings have been handed down to us [Some interruption here took place, part of the audience hissing and a portion cheering the above remarks; but these demonstrations were immediately checked by the Umpire, who said, that if the audience wished him to con¬ tinue to occupy that position, thoy must rigidly refrain from attempting to hiss or applaud during the delivery of the speeches.] Now, why did you hiss? AAras it of importance whether David wrote the 40th Psalm or no If you think it was of no im¬ portance, then my friend should not have opened it. If it was of sufficient importance for him to open it, it was of sufficient importance for me to traverse it. If it be of no importance, then lot it bo dismissed; but I object to his trying to foist upon tho audience statements as to authors or authenticity which he is not prepared to prove, and which I am prepared to question. In the 40th Psalm itself what do you find about Jesus Not a word, from the beginning to the end of it. It is not for me to read the wholo of it through to yon, and I therefore ask our friend when</page><page sequence="154">150 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. he rises again to tell me what I am to find about Jesus in the seventeen verses of which that psalm is composed Passing that, then, and telling you that I do not find anything there which can fairly be taken as referring to Jesus at all, we will come to the New Testament. Our friend puts it that it was necessary that Jesus should bo incarnate; but who was Jesus before be was incarnate Our friend says it is necessary he should have become incarnate. Who was he?—God or any one else than God? I ask our friend to tell me who or what he considers Jesus was before the period of his incarnation. If he was God, then see the dilemma our friend is driven to; and hero is where one body of men who call them¬ selves Christians avoid a large amount of the preposterous absurdity which the orthodox believer in the atonement is obliged to hold; I mean that most intelligent body called Unitarian Christians. AVas Jesus God Then you have God dissatisfied with the condition of things which he himself had caused, wishing to remove it, and you have God removing it by pretending to be a man; because if God could not be man, the taking upon himself the form of man to man was a pretence and a sham. You have him pretending to be a man—liable to man's appetites, subject to man's desires, and having man's aspirations, You have him going through the sham of being born. You have him going through the mockery of childhood and youth. You have him professing to be hungry, when he could not bo hungry—professing to be pained, when he could not be pained—and professing to be in agony at the bitter cup which he himself had made, and could himself have kept from himself. You have thus a most sublime and repulsive delusion put upon you; and the first portion of our question to-night is " Is the doctrine of salvation through the atonement repulsive in its details ?" Our friend says Jesus came to die; his mission was to die. But if he were God before he came, and knew he could not die, his mission was a sham. But our friend makes it worse, for he talks of God and of man, and of Jesus mediating between God and man. Now, if Jesus were God before he was man, how could he mediate with himself? How could he inter¬ pose between himself and some other? The whole thing is illogical. The whole plan has broken down. Take, however, still higher ground. Pass away from these narrow details ; leave aside these absurdities, and we may be well content; for our friend admitted the inefficacy of them all, when ho told you that in his miracles Christ was inimitable, and then afterwards told you that some of the disciples, by faith and through him, per-</page><page sequence="155">FIFTH EVENING. 151 formed miracles, first invoking his name—and if the Bible be true all true believers would have the same power. AAre are told " These signs shall follow them that believe. In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; and they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." So that the part—the miracle working—which our friend says you cannot imitate, is the very part which you are told, if you are faithful, you shall have the power to imitate and excel iu. I pass this because it is of little importance, and the whole matter goes higher What is the plan of salvation through atonement? That man sinning—that God the just requiring a vengeance for that sin—that God merciful desiring to pardon for that sin, permits some one who is not a sinner to become a sacrifice and an atonement for the whole human race. This is the scheme; but then these great difficulties step in: that if the Bible plan of itself be true, tho sacrifice is God, the judge is God, the causer of all the sin is God, and he who might have prevented the necessity alike for the sin, the sacrifice, the atonement, and redemption, is God also. And you have the bitterest of all mockery, if you are to talk of the death, for our friend says that the death is to form the chief picture. It was not the life alone, although our friend makes much of the life ; it was the death. Jesus came to die. " God so loved the world that he gave his onty Son to die for them." Now, if Jesus is to be believed, he did nothing of the kind. When Jesus first came to preach, he said to his disciples, " Go ye not into any way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not." Here was simply a national plan of salvation—a judaical plan of salvation. Ho says, " I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." AVhat, then, is the use of telling me that God so loved the whole world that he sent his only Son to die for them If, the New Testament speaks the truth—if Jesus himself spoke the truth—he came first of all only to save the Jews; and it was upon their rejecting him that a scheme of salvation, which they might have monopolized under the new dispensation as under the old, was offered broadcast to tho whole world, simply because God's people would have nothing to do with it. Our friend says there are two points—the atonement, and tho regeneration or new birth. The atonement, tho most important, is perfected in Jcsus's death; the regeneration or new birth in his life. Now, first, is the life of Jesus such a life as to be worthy of</page><page sequence="156">152 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. our imitation I say frankly and at once, no. I say, that if Jesus lived to-day, neither his doctrine nor his life would be the doctrine or the life of a great reformer. He himself says—what Recommends energetic action?—recommends the discovery of wrong, with a view to its removal ?—recommends keen inquiry into the causes of disease and crime, and to endeavour to get out of your path the obstacles that lie between you and happiness Not one whit of it. Does he recommend manhood and self- reliance? Does he recommend the development to the fullest of human virtues Not at all. On the contrary, he says, ' Watch and pray, for ye know not what hour the Son of man may come.' " Take no thought what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, or wherewithal ye shall be clothed; but first seek the Kingdom of Heaven and its righteousness, when all these things shall be added unto you." Nay, he makes it worse; for he puts before men the doctrine of love to God as an abiding doctrine, which in itself cannot be—for how can you love a God who so little loved his whole family, of whom you are one, that he offered up his only Son as the sacrifice to his own vengeance, when he might have spared his sacrifice and withheld the vengeance You hiss—wait. I have yet to do with that death scene, which our friend has failed to deal with; and if you hiss, wait till I deal with that. I have to deal with the agony in the garden, and if you want to hiss, pen up your feelings, I tell you, until I have dealt with that; for I am about to assail what your exponent says- is the strongest feature of your faith, and which I say is the- weakest—the most repulsive that ever eye glanced over in the- whole record of your sacred book. AVhat is the process of this agony in the garden Our friend says that Jesus came to die, and knew he had to die before he came. It was God himself who planned the death of him. It was no penalty to him. It was no suffering to him. It was no agony to him. It was no torment to him. But when it came near—when the grim skeleton death cast its shadow over the last moments of his life—then, like a coward craven, afraid of the pain and penalty he himself had invoked, he prayed for strength to himself, and had an angel inferior to himself to help him to bear the torment which ho himself had made, and which was no torment to him. Oh! this- spectacle—this scene in the garden—God kneeling down and pray¬ ing for an angel to come—God kneeling down and sweating drops of blood rolling to the ground! You believe this! I will give you heroes who died for humanity, calm, heroic, brave, noble, defiant,</page><page sequence="157">FIFTH EVENING. 153 even when the flames played round their bodies "like forked serpents, licking the vitality from out their bones"; even at the stake, when the flame creeping upwards made the fetters round their arms and legs red hot with vivid fires; even then they were firm. But here is God, who cannot die—who fears the death, and before it comes, with bitter agony, prays that the cup may pass away which he himself has filled. And when at the cross, how does he die Bravely, heroically, nobly, confident in the sacri¬ fice he has made and in its success No, none of this. But on the cross, when about to die, he who is God cries out, " My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!" Could God say this No; it is rather the language of an enthusiast, who had been himself deluded, or of a knave who had deluded others, and who, when the bitterness of the death had come, could keep up the sham no longer, and in the bitter agony of dying, in despair, cried out, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!" You have the details of this plan of salvation. The details— oh, they are grand details God must punish sin because God is just. God desires not to punish sinners, because God is merciful. But God must have vengeance. AVhy? AVhy must God have vengeance Vengeance is not human. Vengeance is not humane. Vengeance is diabolical. The tendency of all legislation at the present moment is not to atone for crime past, but to prevent crime future. The whole endeavour of human thought—the whole study of political economy—the whole of the wisdom of our wisest men—is concentrated not on punishing men for crime that has gone by, but in removing those causes which may tend to crime in the present, or tho futui'e into which that present is springing. But let us examine the plan a little more fully. AVhat is the atonement for—who is it for—and to whom is it offered What is the atonement for Adam's sin or ours If for Adam's, what have we to do with it and if for ours, does he mean that all our sin is atoned for before we commit it—that all the rascality we may be guilty of was planned beforehand that we should be guilty of it, and a sacrifice and receipt in discharge taken 2,000 years before its committal If our friend puts that, it is one of the most absurd, barbarous and repulsive doctrines that could be put to you at all. And if not, what does it mean Let us see who is the atonement for Those who died before the time of Jesus? Yes, or no? If those who died before the time of Jesus were saved by tho atonement without believing on him—and they must have been saved without believing on him, if saved at all, H3</page><page sequence="158">154 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. because they knew nothing of him at all—they never heard of him—I defy my friend to find any trace of him in the Old Testament at all—if they were saved without believing on him, then it is very unjust to compel us as a condition precedent to our benefiting by that atonement, to do that which a large amount of the human race had not to do. And if Jesus, by his coming, only saved and atoned for those who lived after him, then it is very unfair to those who died before him, that they had not an atone¬ ment too. If the atonement was not necessary for them who died before, why was it necessary at all If it was necessary for those who came after, why was it not equally necessary for those who died before Pass, however, a little further. What is this atonement for—or to whom? For me to God Yes, our friend will say, but he will oppose some conditions. AVhat do I find in the Hebrews, from which he has quoted this evening I find this text:—" By the which will wo are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus, once for all." AVere we sanctified once for all by the offering of the body of Jesus Then we need not strive at all; we are all sanctified—all of us. Rascal you may be, but you are sanctified, notwithstanding. In the workhouse, in the penitentiary, in the prison, in the gaol, in the galley- ship, in the convict land—all of you sanctified by Christ. If it does not mean that, what does it mean? If there are any who are exempted from the sanctifieation, what exempts them AVill our friend tell you that only those are to enjoy the sancti- fication who believe in Jesus AVill that be what he says Is it one of the details of the plan of salvation through the atone¬ ment, not simply that Jesus should atone for man, but also that men should believe in the atonement ?—because, if so, what will become of the nations that never hoard of Jesus Christ, and there¬ fore cannot believe in him And if he tells you that the heathen nations who never had the opportunity of hearing of him will bo saved with those who do believe, then, I ask, why should I be dealt with more unjustly than the heathen—he not believing because he has not heard, and I not believing because I have heard too much, and cannot believe But a few words more, and I have done. I appeal to my friend in what he has to say, to meet this question fairly. Let him tell me the difference between the ceremonial and the moral law, not with round phrases, but dealing with the texts; and let him tell me when he rises again, whether, if he was the father of the great human family, he would offer up his own son a sacrifice for sin com-</page><page sequence="159">FIFTH EVENING. 155 mitted by men dead 6,000 years ago, and with which sin that little child had no partp And whether if he did, he would not be an in¬ human inonster—a foul, bloody-minded thing—instead of a man Me. Baekee:—If I believed in Iconoclast's God that he has set up in his own imagination, or if I believed in Iconoclast's Christ, I should speak as strongly about him as he has. We have had descriptions in detail—not of the Bible's Christ, nor yet of the Bible's God—but of Iconoclast's; the only one he is able to find in the book. Ho wants me to tell him the difference between a ceremonial law and a moral one. I don't think there is much difficulty in that. AVhat I understand by a moral law is this: that which has reference to something which, in its own intrinsic nature, is evil or good; the one forbidden, the other commanded, because of that. But a positive, or ceremonial law, is instituted purely upon the authority and the wisdom of another, as in the case of God. The old Levitical sacrifices were ceremonial laws, because divinely instituted, not because man could in all cases see the reason why they were instituted, but because God intended that they should prefigure to him, as much as they were able to prefigure, of great moral principles and duties. He wants to know if the taking of the name of God in vain be an offence against a moral law I say yes, most certainly it is; and I very much fear that he will find the effect to be so another day. He wants to know if I am prepared to abide by the passage found in the Book of Leviticus—only he has not told me where—about the devoted thing. AVell, it is in the 27th chapter of the Book of Leviticus. The words read are read correctly enough; but he has not stopped to tell you that there are two different kinds of offering mentioned in that chapter; and I will therefore stop to do it for him. If you will turn to the chapter; as many of you as have Bibles, I would wish to do so; for I would rather spend all my time upon this one case than take up some of those—[The Umpire :—Don't call names.]—I won't characterize them, because if I did I should perhaps speak too strongly. Now, in the 27th chapter of Levi¬ ticus, you have in the 2nd verse these words: " Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, AVhen a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation." Then the writer goes on through a series of verses to describe what those singular vows shall have reference to. I shall not take up your time or mine by reading the whole of this chapter— if I cannot be believed without doing that, let Iconoclast put me</page><page sequence="160">156 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. right when he rises. The 28th verse was quoted by Iconoclast r " Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the Lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord." I will read a stronger passage- than that, which he might have read: " None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death." Now that is strong, apparently, on his side; but when you remember that in this case, in this chapter, you have two different kinds of vows or offerings—votive offerings—tho whole case appears to my mind to be perfectly clear and plain. In the second verse we have the word (neder), " something that is promised or vowed in prayer, and thereby consecrated to God. As the chapter says, a man should so consecrate perhaps his family to God, so consecrate his flocks and herds to God, so consecrate his land and its produce to God, or at least some parts of them. Now, the chapter provides with reference to all these things— every one of them so devoted under the force of that word neder in tho second verse—that they should be redeemed by a price ac¬ cording to their value, or, as the word in the text says, their " estimation." But when you come to the 28th verso you have- the word (charem), " a thing devoted by cursing ;" and it is the thing devoted by cursing of which it is said " nothing shall be redeemed;" and I deny that it has any reference whatever—and my assertion is as good as my friend's, till he has shown proof to the contrary—I deny it has any reference whatever to sacrifice, the very thing he tried to show it referred to, in order that he might fix upon the character of the God of the Bible that which were odious enough if it were as he says. In relation to the appointment, or permission if not appointment, of human sacri¬ fices among others as setting forth an atonement for sin, I say- there is no reference whatever to that in this chapter. Two dis¬ tinct things ai'e referred to ; and if my assertion—for I have not time to do more now—is not enough, I will bring him powerful authority, from Jewish writers which I have here, to bear me out. And surely a Jew would not favour Christianity if he know it. I will show how Maimonides and Aben Ezra, and other Jewish authorities in olden times, have understood that chapter, and in¬ terpret it this day—that it has reference to two distinct classes of things previously consecrated to God, some of which he might re¬ deem by an estimation or price; and things set apart according to the Lcvitical requirements by the judges on the bench, consigning</page><page sequence="161">^IFTH EVENING. 157 the criminal to death; in such a case the thing was not able to be redeemed, but the sentence was to take its effect. My friend has referred to the sacrifice of Cain and Abel. I cannot see myself what the sacrifice of Cain and Abel has to do with the death of Christ. Cain and Abel were simply two men offering their sacrifices to God; but it was not simply that it was a bloody victim in the one case and not in another that made the great difference between them in God's estimation. AA"e are dis¬ tinctly told in the New Testament that it was the faith of Abel that enabled him to offer a more acceptable sacrifice than his brother Cain; and that because of this moral difference—for faith is an essential quality of moral character—because of this essential moral difference between the two men, partly, though not alto¬ gether, the sacrifice of the one was accepted and the sacrifice of the other rejected. But what did God say, taking the Old Testa¬ ment narrative alone just now—what did God say to Cain when he perceived Cam's anger, and reproved him for it AAliy, he said this: " AVhy art thou wrath, and why is thy countenance fallen If thou doest well," or properly, consistently with the position in which thou standest, "shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at thy door;" or, as some of our best commentators say, "The sin-offering still lies at thy door, come and take that and use that, and then thou shalt find accept¬ ance as thy brother has found it." AVe are referred to Leviticus xvi., 8th and following verses. In answer to that, I shall simply refer you to the 10th chapter of Paul's Epistle to the Hebrews, because it is a principle with us Christians that one part of the book helps to explain another. I fancy my opponent reads Shakespeare on that principle. I fancy he reads English history on that principle. I fancy he would scold most vociferously if I did not read his pamphlets on that principle. I go, then, to the New Testament for the explanation of the mysterious passage we have had from Leviticus ; and there I find that the law was a shadow of the good things to come. Now, please tell me which is the best method of gaining something like a fair idea of a person you have not seen ?—in these days of photograplry, especially, our illustration may be a very simple one. Send me the portrait, you say, in a letter. AVell, you have not seen tho person, or thing, but you have seen the representation thereof—not correct to the life, but so far correct as to give you a proximate idea of what you will see when you see the living reality. Now, it was not Christ's person, but Christ's work, that was to be</page><page sequence="162">158 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. set forth by the pictures and the types of the Old Testament; and I ask, by what better means could he be thus set forth in his work than by the ceremonies and sacrifices of the old Mosaic law, till he should come for himself and make known his own character by his own life and death Then Iconoclast tells us that Jesus Christ, even if you take him at the best, only intended to set up a national kind of religion. I deny that in toto. If he simply means that Jesus Christ intended that the Jews should have the first offer of the blessings of the Gospel, I am quite at one with him. We shall not dispute about that. But that is not what he means. He means more than that, or else we should not need to dispute about it. The Lord Jesus Christ says him¬ self, in the Gospel of John, "And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men "—not all Jews—" unto me." And in the lifting up there you have no possible means of escaping the thought of Christ's death. It is to that death he refers. But why were the Jews to have the first refusal Then forefathers had all the types and shadows in their care, and it would have been an act of injustice indeed, if tho Saviour upon the first blush of his appearance in the world had turned his back upon the Jewish people and said nothing to them about the way of salvation, and had gone to the Gentiles and preached to them. Therefore he preached the Gospel to the Jews first, and afterwards to the Gentiles. Let the New Testament bo taken, and you will see that Christ laboured as much among the Galileans and the Samaritans who had come from the far East in the time of the Babylonish captivity, and whom the Jews proper looked upon as dogs beneath their feet, as he did among the Judmans themselves. Was this like setting up a national reli¬ gion Certainly not. Besides, take what Paul says as the great reason -why the Saviour did so act, and then, I think, if my friend be a candid man, as I have hitherto taken him to be, he will be silent on that point. In Ephesians, the 3rd chapter, we have this very matter discussed. Paul says, " I, the prisoner of Christ for you Gentiles, if ye have heard of tho dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward: how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit." AVhat was tho mystery Some incomprehensible doctrine It has no reference to the doc¬ trines except this simple one, " that the Gentiles should be fellow-</page><page sequence="163">FIFTH EVENING. 159 heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the Gospel. Paul, therefore, shows that the great end of the Christian religion was world-wide, as far as nations were con¬ cerned; and he says, therefore, "that in Christ Jesus there is neither Jew nor Gieek, barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but all are one in Christ" He says again, that it is by the cross of Christ that the Gentiles, who were strangers from the covenants of promise—referring to the old Jewish covenants and ordinances —and were without hope and without God in the world, were now brought nigh by the blood of Christ; mark, by the blood of Christ; not by his life, not yet by his death, but by his blood. " For he is our peace, who hath made both one "—both Jew and Gentile lying in sin—" and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us." But how did he break it down " Having abolished in his flesh the enmity ." What enmity " Even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace." The Umpire here called " Time." Iconoclast :—My friend has been kind enough to tell you that he will refrain from characterizing my speech. I am glad of that; but there is one thing I wish he would not refrain from doing, that is, from answering it. He has, it seems to me, avoided again, as much as possible, the details of the atonement. In his remarks on Leviticus, and in the preface to them, he was kind enough to explain to us what he conceived to be the difference between the moral and ceremonial law. He said a moral law was one which depended upon whether the nature of the thing to which the law related was intrinsically good or evil. That was a moral law; that a ceremonial law was one which depended simply upon the authority of the person making the law. And then he told us that the command " Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain," was a moral law. But he forgot to show us anything intrinsically evil in it; and I submit that according to his own definition that is a command solely depending on the authority of him who made it and gave it, and that he has to tell us what " taking the name of the Lord in vain" is, first; and then he has to show us what there is intrinsically evil in it; before it can come under the definition of moral law, according to his own case. And he forgot to tell us whether the stealing a woman, robbing her of her virtue, and turning her out</page><page sequence="164">160 MODERN ATHEISM AND TnE BIBLE. into a wide world, whether she would or not, was moral or cere¬ monial. I insist upon an answer to that when he rises again. He also forgot to tell us, when dealing with a portion of the question, as to whether the scheme was worthy tho acceptance of the human race, whether he, as a father, would have behaved to his son as he represented in the Bible scheme that God has done to his. He told you that I did not give you the right view of the atonement. I gave you, he said, my view, and admitted that it was the only view I could find there. But he forgot to tell you why it was the only view I could find there. I will tell you. It was because it is tho only one to be found there. He saj's that there is a difference betweeu the offering up of human sacrifices and the sacrifices mentioned in the 27th chapter of Leviticus ; and, by the way, the verse he said I did not read was the only verse I did road, but that is not very important. Let us see. He says that the man might be redeemed. Suppose the man vowed, and had not the money to be redeemed—what then AAras he to be sacrificed for want of redemption-money, or what is to become of him That is my friend's case, not mine. I am applying my questions to his hypothesis. Next I show you that it does not mean that. " None devoted, that shall bo devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death." AVhat becomes then of his talk about redemption, when you are told that those human beings who were devoted should not be redeemed at all, but should be put to death You actually find several instances in which it happened. In tho 21st chapter of Numbers, Israel vowed a vow to tho Lord, and said, " If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities. And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities." Turn again to Jephthah. " Jephthah vowed, whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace, shall surely be tho Lord's, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering. And when Jephthah came to his house, behold, his daughter came out to meet him: and her father did with her according to his vow which he had vowed." Can you have anything more expressive My friend wanted proof; and when he would take us to the Hebrews to explain it, and when he would tell us that tho Hebrew would make it better than it is, I tell him ho says that which is not true, and that no translation of that chapter will fairly and properly alter it. But he uses a most extraordinary argument. He says, I will quote Maimonides, and Maimonides would not defend</page><page sequence="165">FIFTH EVENING. 161 Christianity. Why, if Maimonides wrote to explain Leviticus, he would write for the sake of defending Judaism—to remove some of the blots and stains that are upon it. Then, our friend—pur¬ suing his defence, which he didn't give, and only might give under some other circumstances—goes on to tell you that the ceremonial law was the best fitted to typify the sacrifice and work of Christ. What evidence have you of that nature but my friend's assertion And he says that the Levitical ceremonial law was ordained on purpose for that. AArhat evidence have you for it My friend's assertion, and no more. The grave questions relating to atonement he passed over altogether. All the numerous questions I put to him relating to it were left entirely without answer. He had something else to talk about, and preferred not answering these. He, however, did deal with that portion of my speech relating to the offer of the salvation to the Jews, and he says, that if I mean that tho Jews had the first refusal of it, he agrees with me; but, if I mean that they had only the first offer of it, then he is in accord with me. AYhat would have happened if they had taken it AVould it have been like the old scheme of salvation given to Abraham and his descendants/and no one else besides Oh, he says, the Jews had had it before. They had had tho old lease of tho house, and they ought to have the offer of the new one. It would have been unfair to have passed them by. Unfair! AVhy these wore the people whom God chose, and who behaved so badly to him. These were tho people whom ho performed miracles amongst, and who would not believe in him. These were tho people who went after other gods; and the Gentiles, who never had tho chance at all, were to be loft to the last. Our friend thinks it would be positively unjust to pass them by, but he says that Jesus meant it ultimately to come to the whole human race. And how does he prove it He quotes one text about Jesus saying that when ho was lifted up he would draw all men unto him. That is figurative, I suppose, and our friend can hardly be accepted as an exponent of that. He goes to Paul, but Paul is to be taken as an exponent after, not before, the event. If before, then it might have been some argument; but Jesus himself said, after the Jews had rejected it, " Go ye out into all nations and preach the Gospel." But it was at first that he said, " Go ye not into any city of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not." Our friend says, Jesus himself did as much among tho Samaritans as the Jews. Then he did it in contradiction to his orders to his disciples. Ho ordered</page><page sequence="166">162 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. them not to go there ; and let us try this question for a moment. He says the Jews had the first refusal after Jesus' coming. AYas the plan of atonement so complete that those who believed were to be saved, and those who did not were to be damned Yes, or no If so, then it ought to have been made to the whole world, that all might have had the opportunity of believing. If not, when did it become complete, and is it complete now And why should anj-body be damned if some were left out Our friend had not time to deal with the 40th Psalm. He will find it necessary, I suppose, to do it—perhaps he will be able to do it instead of talking upon tho French Revolution in his last speech to-night. Our friend refers a little, and but a little, to the 16th chapter of Leviticus ; but in the whole of tho speech to which we have just listened I have been at a loss to discover anything which could seem like an explanation of the details of the plan of salva¬ tion which would make them otherwise than repulsive. And I have been at a loss through the whole evening to find anything about the tendency of the atonement at all—and I will, therefore, devote a few words to the examination of that, if you please. What is the tendency of the great plan of atonement The plan of atonement is that God, the judge, having to condemn sinners, either being tired of condemning them, or else, as our friend put it, beginning to consider what the angels in heaven and the fallen ones down below would say about him, by and by determines to con¬ demn them no longer, and lets one who is not a man—our friend forgot to tell us what Jesus was before his incarnation—he says he was not a man after it, and he drew the distinction between somebody who says he was not a man, and Jesus, who was man. God sends some ono who was not a man, but God himself, to die, and who dies, if at all, for everybody at every time. If he did not, where is tho limitation? Then, this atonement is for all sin. AVhat morality is there in tho tendency of that What atone¬ ment is there for crime—tell me? Human beings, the only atonement there is for crime is that atonement which, founded on the knowledge of tho misery your crime has brought to human beings, compels you by better, truer, nobler actions, to repair the wrong you have done, and, in your life of good, atone thus and only thus. There is no atonement in a crucified God. There is no atonement in the repulsive picture of a dying God who cannot die—in the picture of a man dying 2,000 years ago, among the people who believed him not—leaving a legacy of never dying fire to those who cannot believe him now. There is no atonement</page><page sequence="167">FIFTH EVENING. 163 in that. This plan is repulsive. This plan is derogatory. This plan is immoral. The only atonement possible for human kind is an atonement of earnest, vigorous thoughts, of nervous, manly actions, of self-reliant effort, in which each age atones, not for the age that has gone before, but for itself in its own effort; and making a plan of salvation for human kind that shall come after them far easier by the noble deeds they do, and the noble thoughts they utter out to them. Why, sir, this question for your opening remains unanswered; for, while you have told me I have not lead Christ's life aright, you have taken good care not to read it at all. Your pictures of Christ's life—what are they This man who, when he was about to die—or God if yo'u will—being anointed with an expensive ointment when'there were poor and starving people around, says—the disciples appealing to his better feelings of kindness and humanity—"Let the ointment be poured on me; the poor ye have always with you :" when, if he was God, he might have prevented that foul cause of all crime—poverty. AA'horn do you hiss? God who makes the poverty, or me for impeaching the foul blasphemy which you yourselves do put upon God Poverty of pocket, poverty of person, poverty of intellect, poverty in every way; if you want one phase of it, look at Lancashire now, where you will find men -who are walking living skeletons, and God's atonement saves them not. Look at Italy, where men arc poor in freedom, and where the only man who, hero-like, rose to save them, not by his death, but by his life—not on the cross, coward-like, craven-like, fearing the death he came to moot—not coming to die hero-like, to raise them up—now in Spezzia's dungeon lies; God stretching forth no hand to him, and Christ's atonement giving no redemption to his down-trodden country. What is this atonement for For Adam's sin You mock me. For human evils AArhat evils does it redress AArhat plague spot does it remove? AA'hat hovel has it made a comfortable home AVhat rags has it stripped off? What disease and wretchedness has it put away? Why, your atonement is a sham. Your atonement is a deception. Your atonement is but a foul leprosy upon human intellect—a plague spot of priestcraft—and I impeach it. Me. Barker :—My friend could not have taken a better name than Iconoclast—an image breaker. First of all he carves the image, and then ho breaks it. The glorious image of Christ, the image of the invisible God, he has not touched, and cannot touch.</page><page sequence="168">164 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. He has not the dimmest perception of its grandeur and majesty as it stands in the Scriptures. But a distorted thing which he calls the Christ he has set up before you, and then gloriously knocked it to pieces. I defy my friend to show any passage of Scripture in which a woman is to be defiled, and then forcibly turned upon the streets by the person that has defiled her, by the authority or with the sanction of the Word of God: and although I shall not be able to answer to-night, because it is my last speech, I will reply to whatever he may say, if I have the opportunity another time. My friend talks to you very magniloquently about Jephthah's vow. AArell, I told you, and he has not disproved my assertion by any authority or criticism, that in the 27th chapter of Leviticus there are two different kinds of offerings or devoted things; and not only would I appeal to the Hebrews itself, as I have already done, as to the absolute difference botweent he two words, neder and charem; but let him go to the Septuagint translation, when he gets home, and he will there find that they uso the word " ana¬ thema" in the 28th verse, but altogether a different word in tho 1st and 2nd verses; so that the Soptuagint translation recognised the essential difference nearly 3,000 years ago. With regard to Jephthah's vow, I could say a great deal, if I had time; but let me simply say that Jephthah's vow is spoken of in Judges, the 11th chapter, by the use of the word " neder" not "charem," and Jephthah was mistaken, in my judgment, on the supposition that he put his daughter to death. But let Iconoclast know—and I think he must know-—that there is a wide difference of opinion between Christian interpreters as well as Jewish, as to whether he did actually sacrifice her or not, or simply set her aside in perpetual virginity, as devoted to the Lord. And, therefore, he has set up tho most extreme opinion of Christian interpreters about the result of Jephthah's vow, and reasoned upon that interpretation as if it were the text—which is generally done by persons when their cause is weak. He wants to know what would have happened if the Jews had accepted the salvation. AVhy, the Gentiles would have had it as well. The whole ten¬ dency of the teaching of tho New Testament is to that effect. He wants to know how I can harmonize the fact that Jesus bade his disciples, in the first instance, not to go into Galilee, with his subsequent command. He will find, if he knows anything at all of the chronology of tho [New Testament gospels, and of the life of Christ, that the first command was given in the beginning of Christ's ministry, perfectly according with what I have said,</page><page sequence="169">FIFTH EVENING. 165 that the first refusal of that salvation was to be offered to the Jews, and then the offer made to the Gentiles. But I did not say, nor do I believe, that the making of it known to the Gentiles was dependent upon whether the Jews accepted it or not. It was a world-wide purpose, and no nation was excluded. The fact of Paul not preaching to the Gentiles till the Jews refused tho gospel has nothing to do with it. The apostle was an un¬ believer till after the death of Christ; and it is most irrelevant to bring forward a case of that kind. Tho disciples preached it, and Christ preached. " I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me;" and that is a passage which neither he nor any one else will be able to overturn. He says I have not yet touched the ques¬ tion really, but in the meantime he would ask me one question, namely, how it was that the Saviour, in the midst of scenes of poverty and distress, suffered himself to be anointed by the dis¬ ciples, who were so much better than ho as to rebuke him for it. I thought Judas was the man The Saviour, however, did not set at naught the claims of the poor, in the way in which ho treated the case. He said, " The poor ye have always with you;" do them what benefit you can. You have ample opportunity ; but this is the only opportunity in which this thing can bo done which has so significant a meaning attached to it, and which this person perceives, but not you. And then the same Saviour has gone so far as to tell us that even the drop of cold water given to a disciple in the name of a disciple shall not lose its reward, and that the great decision of tho last day shall, among other things, turn upon the question how man has dealt with Christ's disciples, as well as how he has acted towards his God. He wants to know what proof I can give him that the great com¬ mand, " Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain," is a moral command. Why, the very nature of the case. It has a moral character in it; it cannot be otherwise. If there be a God, surely respect is due to him from creature man ; and if his name, therefore, be maltreated, is not that the highest immorality that man's heart or thought can conceive of? AVould you treat a man's name scornfully if you loved him Is not love to God the first command No man who loves God can therefore profane his name, if ho knows it. It is those who love him not, and perceive not his glory, that take his name in vain; and herein the immorality of the action. And now, for the two or three minutes still allotted to me, I shall pursue my gentle course a little further. I did not finish</page><page sequence="170">166 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. my first speech for want of time. I want to come to a few direct texts of Scripture, touching upon the influence or tendency of this doctrine of salvation by atonement, which my friend thinks is so sad, immoral, and so forth. So far from that being the case, we are distinctly told that the true reason why the Saviour took his name, Jesus, at all, is that ho shall save his people from, and not in, their sins. If you go to Romans, the 6th chapter, you will find there that tho early Christians so received the doctrine, for they considered that the fact of their professing the name of Christ in the world was a sufficient obligation to them to live in newness of life. Paul says, in tho second verso of tho 6th chapter, " How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein ?" Then he says again, at the 8th verse, " Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him, knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more ; death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he livcth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin : but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God." He speaks to the same purport in 2 Cor. 5 ; making the very love of Christ in his death tho grand spring and motive of all right action on the part of Christian men. In the 14th and following verses ho says, " The love of Christ eonstraineth us." And if the love of Christ bowhat it is represented in the New Testament, we can¬ not wonder that it should constrain a man to live a holy and a pure life. The great marvel is that men who profess to believe the doctrine should not be more influenced by it; and if we wanted proof of the innate depravity of our hearts, and the necessity there is for Divine influence to make us holy, as well as for an atonement for our sins, we should find the proof in renewed men on account of the imperfection that still pertains to them as men. Ho says :— "And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for thorn, and rose again." So much for tho moral influence of the doctrine of the atonement on a man's heart and best affections. We are told also that peace of conscience is brought home to man by tho doctrine of salvation by Josus Christ; and I would refer him for this to the 9th chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, verses 24—26.</page><page sequence="171">FIFTH EVENING. 167 " For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us : nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world, but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put awa}' sin by the sacrifice of him¬ self." Now take the 10th chapter, and there you will find that the effect of this sacrifice is that those who receive it are purged from their sin, and "have no more conscience of sin." Then Christ, in his own language, while on earth, said—" Peace I leave with you; my peace give I unto you; not as the world givcth give I unto you." " Tho peace of God," says Paul, in regard to the same matter, " which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds by the faith which is in Christ Jesus." Further, this doctrine of atonement is taught in the Scripture as a bond of union between man and man—between Jew and Gentile. If you want liberty, fraternity, and equality, you will not have it until our gospel prevails in every heart and in every land. It is just in proportion, and only in proportion, as that result is achieved, that you will find man raised from what heathenism has made him ; from what superstition has made him ; from what infidelity has made him, whenever she has had the chance; but that has not been often. And the doctrine of the atonement again, although this is more speculative than practical—the doctrine of atonement is said to be the grand theme that unites all holy intelligences, in every part of God's universe, into one grand bond of brotherhood and holy fellowship. And, therefore, in Revelations, v. 13; in Colossians, i. 16, 18; in Ephesians, iii. 15, taken in conjunction with collateral passages, you will find that angels and men are made one by that means—one towards each other, and one towards God. Now then, let me finish with two or three stray thoughts. The idea of atonement could not have originated with the Jewish mind; for the Jewish mind, from the first, was set against it, and did its best to put it out of existence; and, because the doctrine of the cross was a scandal to that mind, the Jews put Christ to death. Then, again, we find that this same truth was a stumbling- block to the Jews afterwards and folly to the Greek : while the apostle says, that in the wisdom of God it was made the power of God to salvation to every soul that should believe it. AVhy, even the disciples of Christ did not at first understand it, when</page><page sequence="172">16S MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. he preached it to them. They thought he had better avert his death, and stay with them permanently. But he showed them that tho things he should suffer in Jerusalem, together with the ascent to heaven that should follow thereupon, were absolutely essential to perfect the scheme of redemption, and lay the broad foundation for man's eternal interests. Then I ask, again, will not this doctrine of the incarnation bear comparison with the other doctrines of incarnation, as in Egypt, India, Persia—or even with the most pure of all the old systems, the Zorastrian I defy my friend, anywhere or at any time, to show that there is another idea of the incarnation of God among men so simple and pure as that which is found in the New Testament. The Umpire called " Time." Iconoclast :—Either I or my friend has misunderstood the question for debate this evening. It appeared to me that tho question was not one of comparison between the Christian scheme of atonement and some other scheme of atonement— between the Christian scheme of incarnation and some other scheme of incarnation—but that the question was, whether the plan of salvation through the atonement was repulsive in its details, immoral in its tendency, and unworthy the acceptance of the human race. I addressed myself to those details. AArhat reply has my friend made He has told you that I drew my own image, and then destroyed that which I myself had made; but he carefully refrained from going through the imago I had drawn, and showing where it was erroneously drawn ; and he still more carefully refrained from drawing any picture himself. The most laughable thing is, that he actually reproached mo that I had not given you the image of the invisible God. How I was to give you the image of the invisible God, I am sure I do not know; and it does appear to me that, if ever there should be a command about taking the name of God in vain, our friend would come in for the breach of it as clearly as anybody whom it has been my fortune to meet. Is the scheme of atonement repulsive in its details Our friend has hesitated to tell us whether Jesus was God or man before he came. He has declined to tell us what he thought Jesus was. He has declined to tell us whether 'the atonement related to those who came before Jesus, as well as to those who came after. [Mr. Barkee:—The report will show.] And, when our friend says</page><page sequence="173">fifth evening. 169 the report will show, I will ask him simply to do as I do—leave it to the report to show, by observing, as I observe, silence while my opponent is addressing me. He has neglected to answer whether the whole of human kind were included in the atone¬ ment or no. He has neglected to tell us whether the verse from the Hebrews—which he himself referred to, and which I read— namely, that Jesus came to sanctify us once for all, has any force or no. Ho has avoided dealing with the whole of these questions. He has declined to tell you whether the atonement was for Adam's sin, or for ours. He has avoided the whole of the details in relation to it; and, instead of grappling with the answers I gave him, and the questions I proposed to him, he has wound up with reading something which he intended to read from, because he dare not encounter tho image I have set up. Our friend has challenged me to read to you a passage from Scripture. I accept his challenge reluctantly, but I accept it, notwithstanding; and it is not fair for him to say that he will not have the opportunity of replying to it, because it is not the first time I have laid it on this table; and he might have challenged its production before. I will read it to you now. " AVhen thou goest forth to war against thino enemies, and the Lord thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive, and seest- among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; then thou shalt bring her home to thino house ; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not soil her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her." Our friend can afford to cheer that record of a barbarous age; that record of an ignorant people; that record of a vicious, a depraved, a lustful race. Here you arc told that if the soldier, heated with war, steals a beautiful woman from her home, takes her to his, and robs her of her virtue, ho may turn her into the wide world to go whither she will. I wish our friends on the platform would set an example, during the debate, of preserving that order which, I think, I may fairly say, has characterized my conduct during the whole of it. I appeal to you—I knew that when I dealt with I</page><page sequence="174">170 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. these things, you would be pained—I knew you would bov excited—but I appeal to you, that if you wish me to believe that your religion has any effect on you, you would, at any rate, preserve a calmness which an infidel has set }-ou an example of. If you cannot, you give me a right to complain. Now, if you will not, then you only give me tho right to say to you that your religion breaks out despite yourselves, and that it is true that you hold the doctrine that without blood there shall be no&gt; remission of sin; and that you are tho same Christians—not as those who in the reign of terror, excited by wrongs under which they had laboured, rose to redress them—but the same as those in the Crusades, who, with the cross upon their shoulders and upon their breasts, committed what Moshoim calls, " those infernal crimes which have stamped Christianity as odious in the&gt; history of the world." I do not pretend that that is part of tho question, but it is just as much a part of the question as was the reign of terror; it is just as much part of the question as was our friend's telling you of the state to which infidelity has brought you. AArhy, infidelity never made you so base and foul as you were in tho 5th century of the Church, when Salvian, tho presbyter of it, told you that you were guilty of fornication, adultery, robbery, murder, lying, swearing; and that a man was a saint to be a little less vicious than his neighbours. I leave these things with you, and now address myself to tho question which we ought to have debated, and have not, during this evening. Is the plan of atonement repulsive in its details Is it immoral in its tendency Is it unacceptable to the human race Its details our friend has avoided. Tho details are, that Jesus, who was God before he was man, came down to die, who could not die—to suffer, who could not suffer—that he went through an agony, which was no agony, and prayed to himself, which was a mockery; that bo was strengthened by an angel who had no power to strengthen him, deriving his strength from himself; who died on a cross, who could not die; who bled, who could not' bleed ; who was buried, who could not be buried; who rose again, who could not rise again—to suffer no death, our friend says, although he ate the same material food after his death that he ate before his death. Is not this repulsive AVhy, it repels you in spite of yourselves. And our friend has not tried to show you that it is not in the book as I pictured it. He says it was a picture of my making. A\rhy did he not refute it, then He did try one or two texts; and the best defence he makes of Jephthah's daughter is,</page><page sequence="175">FIFTH EVENING. 171 that translators disagree about it. Glorious revelation, the belief in which is to save you, yet as to its meaning there is a great difference of opinion even among Christians and learned writers I marvel that God has made a revelation so mysterious to human creatures that divines have to dispute about it, and that the best defence against infidels is, that they themselves cannot understand it. Our friend says that Jephthah did not burn his daughter, but that he put her aside for perpetual virginity. Did the Israelites do that with the women in the cities they destroyed Did they put these aside for virginity AVhy, you know that the doctrine of sacrifice for blood is the doctrine that goes through it all, from the beginning to the end. Our friend has in no wise answered any one of the points relating to this. Then as to the justice of it— he has entirely avoided that. He has refrained from telling you what he, as a father, would do, showing that the inhumanity of it presses upon himself. He, as a father, would not offer up his son. He, as a father, would consider it cruel to do it—unmanly—inhu¬ man. And yet he preaches it to us as godly to-night. He has not endeavoured to verify his notion as to what angels above and devils below would say about it. All that has been passed over. Some other night he will answer if, or he will meet me to debate some other time. For shame This passes for no answer; and if it be one with you, I will tell you what I will do with you. I will moot with you on this doctrine of human sacrifice, question and answer, when we cannot beguile the audience about our knowledge of Hebrew—when, question by question, and step by step, we will test each other's knowledge, not playing bv-play about Maimonides and Abon Ezra, but testing what is in each other's brains. AVhen wo arc discoursing a subject in half-hour speeches and quarter-hour speeches, it is easy to go off upon some¬ thing else, but in question and answer we cannot do that; and then, instead of going off to old Hebrew, we shall be better able to stay at home, in plain common English. Cannot you defend the plan of the atonement without reference to Jewish writers Is tho Biblo defenceless without that Is that your defence to¬ night It appears to me that it is so. AVhat have you shown about this that should make the scheme of atonement acceptable What have you shown about it that should make mo purer by believing in it AVhat you have said about the Jews having the first offer or refusal, in no way betters it; and what you have said about the ointment and the poor is simply ludicrous. You fasten the remark upon Judas Iscariot; but, supposing it was his, why 12</page><page sequence="176">172 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. should it not be deserving of comment to-night It is not the man who said it, but what was said, that we are to notice. But if your Biblo be true—although John puts the observation into the mouth of Judas Iscariot—Matthew, who may be supposed to know as much about it, puts it into the mouths of the disciples generally; and I suppose it does not matter whether it was the whole of the disciples who made tho remark or one of them only. AVhy do you attack Judas Because he betrayed Jesus Your plan is, that Jesus came to be betrayed, and Judas was but tho instrument in the hands of God. AVhy, if there had been no Judas, there might have been no atonement. This same Judas saved tho world! If he had not betrayed Jesus—Jesus was already afraid to die, and he might have slunk out of the whole scheme altogether—if that was not so, there was no betrayal. If Jesus was to die, and all was planned, there was no betrayal, and Judas deserved no blame. Now, I ask you to-night, what has our friend said about the scheme of atonement that should make you love it? He has avoided the texts. With beautiful tactics he has avoided all details. He talked about tho new birth and regeneration. AVhen he might have kept to tho subject for debate, he has kept as far as possible from it, because he knew that by the course he was taking he was refraining from that for which nothing could atone—a blasphemy against good humanity. The usual vote of thanks was then passed to the Umpire, and he proceedings terminated.</page><page sequence="177">SIXTH NIG-HT'S DISCUSSION. FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1862. Subject—Is the doctrine of personal existence after death, and of eternal happiness or misery for mankind, fraught with error, and injurious to humanity ICONOCLAST :•—The question for this evening is thus worded: " Is the doctrine of personal existence after death, and of eternal happiness or misery lor mankind, fraught with error, and injurious to humanity " It seems to me that the only thing necessary for us to do to-night is to ascertain whether the doctrine of personal exist¬ ence after death be true or false; if false, it seems to mo that it must necessarily bo injurious to humanity : for I cannot conceive that the prevalence of any doctrine untrue could be of permanent utility, or of permanent benefit, to tho people amongst whom it prevailed. I shall, therefore, endeavour to ascertain whether the doctrine of personal existence after death be true or false. AVhat is life? AA'hat is death? First, what is life? Dr. Thomas Cooper translated a work on insanity—a most able work by a Fiench physiologist, M. Broussais—and in that ho says, "Life is the aggre¬ gate of those functions which the several organic parts of the body perform on being stimulated into action by the natural stimuli of caloric, light, ah1, atmospheric electricity, and food, in the usual and regular proportion and degree. The organic action excited by the&amp;c natural stimuli in a healthy body constitute the normal regular healthy functions of tho various parts so stimulated into action, the aggregate whereof is included in the term life." By life I mean, and express, and so define life, '• The aggregate of organic functional activity—the aggregate of normal organic func¬ tional activity." There is, however, a phase of the definition which ought not entirely to bo overlooked, and that is, that the word</page><page sequence="178">174 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. "life" is often used, with regard to men, in a wider sense; in¬ cluding not merely what is ordinarily conceived to be functional activity, but also those other phases of activity comprehended under the head intellectual. Man in his earliest state manifests none of these. Broussais says, " In the first moment of his exist¬ ence, man is no more than a diminutive mass; he possesses no distinct organ, but the atoms of the mass arrange themselves ac¬ cording to the laws of an affinity which we distinguish at a dis¬ tance, so as to form successively the various animal tissues. During all these efforts of vital chemistry, the nerves and the cncephalon have no occupation. They become developed, and that is all." I suppose, however, this evening, that we shall have to treat the word "life" as including much more than this. Our friend will probabfy wish to include in life all the phenomena of the intellect. I will, then, tell you what I mean by tho word " intelligence," and if my friend means other than I do by the word " life," or bv the word "intelligence," I require him in his first speech, not simply to toll you that I am incorrect in my definitions, but to give you the definitions with which he would wish to replace mine ; because it will not do for us simply to stand on two oppo¬ site sides of the stream pelting stones each along our own side. We have met to make war upon one another's thought, in order that the thought which is the false one may be destroyed in the conflict of arms which we have here to-night. By intelligence, then, I mean the sum of the nervous encephalic ability—I mean the aggregate of all those mental operations which find their basis in the ability to sensate, the ability to perceive. I find the ability to perceive—the ability to sensate—at tho base of all intellectual operations; closely followed, but so closely, that it is impossible to discriminate between tho sensation, the action of the sensative ability, and the consciousness of that sensation followed by con¬ sciousness of the" perception of the cognition—followed then by the memory of that consciousness. " Consciousness of cognition," we use in the sense of immediate knowledge of tho present. " Memory," we use in the sense of immediate knowledge of tho past. Some deal with consciousness and memory as though they were special faculties ; and, if our friend does that this evening, I shall be obliged by his telling mo why ho considers them special faculties—what ground he has for so holding them. I do not hold consciousness—I do not hold memory either—to bo a special faculty. I hold consciousness and memory but to bo conditions of the intellect—nothing more, nothing less.</page><page sequence="179">SIXTH EVENING. 175 ' Having put it to you, then, what I consider life to be, what do I hold death to be Because it is important that we should define each portion of the question with which we have to deal. I regard death as precisely the opposite,—the negative of life; and when I use the word " death," I imply by it the negation of all functional ability. In implying by it the negation of all func¬ tional ability, I imply by it the negation of cerebral activity as a phase of functional ability; and implying the negation of func¬ tional ability, I also imply the negation of all those mental phases which result from the exercise of that ability. Now, what is our question " Is the doctrine of personal existence after death true or false?" AVhat personal existence? And what person Shall I speak of myself Do I die AVhat is it you w ill tell me is to exist Myself in the prime of life, or, should I live to become old, worn out, fatigued, diseased, maimed, is it my maimed personal existence which will be repeated after I die AArhat personal existence is it you dream of? The personal existence as of my childhood—personal as of my youth—personal as of the prime of my life—personal as of its fading period AA'hat do you think about this AVhat kind of existence do you hope to live out by and by What kind of existence do you think to live out by and by On what are your thoughts based AVhy do you hope to live in one slate more than the other And if you toll me that you hold that men will live after death just in the state in which they die, then see the miserable doctrine of personal existence that you will then evoke. A man who is shot in battle •—who has his head blown off by the shot—tell me, do you believe he will exist headless, or that his head—[Hisses.]—I warn you again, do not hiss. You will have plenty to hiss at by and by. I am endeavouring to give you something to answer—by and by I will give you something which shall strike you with shame with the history of your religion. Do you expect the body to exist as it was with its fullest ability, or how do you expect the man who has been orator, the man who has been statesman, the man who has been philosopher, the man who has been the keen thinker— [The interruptions here became so great that the Umpire was obliged to appeal again and again for order.]—Do you expect in the existence after death that these men will live again with all those faculties. On tracing him to a madhouse to which he has been confined from an undue exercise of his faculties during life, do you expect that he will live again insane,—the state in which he had the misfortune to die And, if you wish to revert to a</page><page sequence="180">176 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. period of life when the intellect was superior to that manifested! at death, tell me what ground you have for so reverting I pass for a moment to another portion of the question. Tho question is, " Is the doctrine of personal existence after death, and of future happiness or misery for human kind, fraught with error, and injurious to humanity?" The doctrine of eternal happiness or of eternal misery is all involved in a consideration of the definitions I have just put before you. For how can you express either happiness or misery when all sensativc ability is destroyed I have defined death as the negation of sensative- ability; how can you have happiness—a state resulting from the pleasurable exercise of sensative ability; how can you havo misery—the reverse—when all sensative ability has ceased? And if you tell me that sensative ability has not ceased—if you tell me that sensative ability has been renewed—then there cannot be ability to sensate without tho organisms of which that sen¬ sative ability is the necessary result. And if you have tho organism, then tho organism is either sustained as it is now or in some different way—if some different way, what ground have you for believing it And if the same way, then there is the same necessity to eat—to digest—the same liability to disease in a state of after life as there is in the state of present life. I, however, pass this for a moment, to deal with tho doctrine of eternal tor¬ ment from another point of view. Francis William Newman, in dealing with this question, which was one of the earliest obstacles and destructions to his faith, thus says:—" That it is urged in behalf of the advocates of eternal torment that every sin is infinite in desert and in result, because it is committed against an Infinite Being." " Thus," says Newman, " the fretfulness of a child is an infinite evil. I was aghast that I could have believed it. Now that it was no longer laid upon me as a duty to uphold the infinitude of God's retaliation upon sin, I saw that it was an immorality to toach that sin was measured by anything else than the heart and will of the agent. That a finite being should deserve infinite punishment now, was manifestly as unjustifiable as that he should deserve infinite reward, which I never dreamed. Again, I saw that current orthodoxy made Satan eternal conqueror over Christ. In vain docs the Son of God come from heaven and take human flesh, and die on the cross. In spite of him, the devil calls off to- hell tho vast majority of mankind, in whom not misery only, but sin, is triumphant for ever and over. Thus Christ not only does- not succeed in destroying the works of the devil, but even aggra-</page><page sequence="181">SIXTH EVENING. 177 vates them." Newman says, " How much better no futurity for any, than that a few should be eternally in bliss, and the great majority kept alive in eternal sin as well as eternal misery." Why, friends, the Bible view of eternal happiness and eternal misery is so impeachable, that I do not wonder that a large body of men who call themselves Christians shrink with horror from maintaining it at all. What is the doctrine of your Bible I put it to you that the doctrine of the New Testament is, that few shall get to heaven, and that many shall be shut out of it; and I put it, that the man who could hope to scramble into eternal hap¬ piness for himself, while millions of human beings are being launched writhing into eternal torments around him, is no man— that that man is no common brother of our common human family, but a human being perverted into a monster by tho mon¬ strosity of his faith. Is the doctrine of eternal happiness or misery for mankind fraught with error, and injurious to humanity? AVhat is the doctrine as contained in the New Testament Take, for instance, the 25th chapter of Matthew, and the 14th verse— that chapter which puts to you the parable of the talents. It begins, " For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling,"— and so on. You may remember what tho parable was. The parable was that tho man who had but a little talent entrusted to him was expected to do as much in proportion with his little talent as the man with a large number of talents was expected to do in proportion with his. And one of the parables of the talents winds up thus—" Unto him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall bo taken away even that which he hath." Reduce this to tho ordinary logic of evory-day life, and what does it mean It means that the Caffre, or the worse than Catt're, the inhabitant of Central Africa, or even worse than him, some of the lowest order of the human race—that from them will be expected in proportion to their little ability as much as will be expected from the higher order of ability in proportion to that; while, in truth, what is the fact The fact is, that tho man with great powers has better opportunity of achieving his part in tho battle of life than tho man with small powers has at all. You arc swimmers in tho great stream of life. The man who has great ability to swim may keep himself above the tide, buoyed up with the life-buoys under his arms, around his body; the poor, unfortunate wretch, weak beside him, with but little ability to swim, is sucked under with the current that is swiftly rolling on. And yet we are told that God in heaven</page><page sequence="182">178 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE, will curse that man because he did not keep afloat with his little ability.—[No!]—You say, "No." I will tell you more than this; and when you say " no," I ask you to wait till some one else says " no'" for you. The most that some of you can say is "no;" and I have to remark that there is one person who night after night has been near this platform, who pretends to be a missionary, a reader and preacher of God's Word, and who at any rate should know better than to interrupt. The best way to save yourselves from being struck, if it is unpleasant, is not to strike at me. You will find I shall keep to the question so long as you do not inter¬ fere with me. AVhen you interfere with me, you must take the consequences of your own acts. I will now go on with your pictures of heaven and hell. AVhat pictures of heaven and hell are drawn to you in the Bible! You have the picture of Ilea's en as a wedding-feast to which some were invited, and they would not come. Others were invited, and they maltreated the messenger; and at last the servants were sent out to press in from the high¬ ways, the byways, the hedges and ditches, the ragged, the maimed, the blind, the lame. All, every one, were invited to come in. There was no compulsion, but every one was obliged, whom the servant found, to come in to this wedding-feast; and when they were there the king of the feast came, and he saw one man who had not a wedding garment upon him. And he said, " Friend, why hast thou not on a wedding garment?" What did the man say He had been dragged from out of some ditch or hedge—out of some byway—some lane ; what did he say Our friend, perhaps, will tell us—the text does not. According to the text, he made an answer characterized with wisdom most remark¬ able—he said nothing. And what did the king say Take him, bind him hand and foot, and cast him into outer darkness, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth—"for many are called, but few are chosen." Heaven is open wide. You will bo compelled to come in whether you will or no; and if your dress be not cut to the fashion of heaven, you will be thrown out without liberty to say aught for yourself. That this is so, I shall be able to demonstrate to you as we go on. But, supposing you get leave to continue there ; suppose you are of the regular orthodox cut and right fashion; what then? What is heaven like? Take, again, another parable, the parable of Lazarus and of Dives — the rich man and the poor man. There was a rich man and a poor man—a beggar, a man who lay at the rich man's gate. The</page><page sequence="183">SIXTH EVENING. 179 rich man died, and he was carried down below; the poor man died, and he was carried up above. Our friend puts the localities as below and above. I am not myself aware which is below and which is above; but he fixed them the other night. The poor man is taken into Abraham's bosom, so that Abraham is in heaven— a man that turned his wife out into a desert to starve; a man who had slaves; a man who was going to murder his own son, because he thought God commanded him to do it—God not commanding any man to do such cruel, unmanly, and unfatherly acts. There are also there, if the New Testament be true, Jacob and all tho saints. Lazarus is in heaven; and he sees, afar off, the rich man ; and the rich man sees him ; so that from heaven, good Christians, you may see the heretic in hell. On earth, you may have been man and wife. On earth, you may have been brother and sister, loving one another truly, cherishing one another humanely—having for one another kindly feelings, hopes, and aspirations. But in heaven you will be eternally happy. Husband, you will be eternally happy, whileyour wife is writhing, within sight and hearing of you, in hell—in agony for ever. Do not believe it. The doctrine is monstrous. The doctrine is inhuman. The doctrine is terrible, and it is fraught with misery to human kind. This doctrine of eternal happiness and eternal misery, what good do you think—what benefit accrues, from the believing of it Do you know what has accrued I will tell you. Eighteen centuries of lust, of murder, of fraud, of chi¬ canery, founded upon it, and called Christianity, has accrued out of it. Brave thoughts have not; noble deeds have not; for the professedly Christian church has, every century—from the earliest century we know anything of it, till the century we have just passed out of—stood in the way of every brave man. She has produced men famed for licentiousness, famed for wickedness, famed for their tyranny, famed for their cruelty; but few famed for their salvation of human nature—of human kind. Oh, but some say, if you give up the doctrine of hell and heaven, how will you keep men honest, and make them moral Certainly, we cannot toast them into honesty. AA'e have not a pinch of brimstone to frighten you, if you cannot accept what we say without it. All we can hope to move you with here, is not with the fire of hell and devils, but with the grandeur of the mighty truths which we all strive for, and which interests you and us together. I have to put to you this grave question—how many men has your doctrine of eternal torment kept away from crime Are not the criminals</page><page sequence="184">180 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. men professing to believe in eternal torment—men professing to hope for eternal salvation Do not the statistics of your country make it out so ?—[Interruption.]—I beg your quietude; for if you are not content, then I shall deem it that my only course shall be to impeach your wicked church and every member of it; and to show what it has been from its histories, which I have taken pains to bring with me here to-night, lest they should be doubted. I am content to meet you fairly, man to man, letting my thought go against yours; but if you will but meet me as dogs—-barking, biting, growling, snapping—then I must treat you with the cur's deserts. This doc.trine of eternal torment, does it make men moral? This doctrine of eternal happiness, does it make men good, and pure, and true? AVe who are without it, what ties have we Punishment never made men good, true, honest, yet. Retributive vengeance for crime past is itself a crime. When men were strung up by the score at the Old Bailey, it was found, that even at the foot of the gallows' tree, crime there abounded. Tho best means of preventing crime has been by removing the causes which made men criminal. Now, 3 our eternity of torment, what has it to do To reform men No; for they have no opportunity of life at the end of the punishment. Their punish¬ ment endures, so you tell me, for ever and for ever. There is here a terrible, here a monstrous, here a fiendish doctrine. We, on the contrary, tell you this,—that the man who eschews evil, because he knows that in each evil thought, and in each evil deed, evil results to himself as surely as to his follows; who does good, not for heaven by and by but because it is good, and strews the garden of his life with flowers here;—that is the doctrine, and that the man, and that the best morality to preach to you. Your eternal happiness and misery, how does it help you You are told in tho Bible, that the greater the sinner the better the saint he makes. " There is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine righteous men." I teli you that this doctrine would make scoundrels, and not make good men and women. Of the little of life is the muchness of life made up. Of the moments of life are composed the hours. Live good and true each moment of your life. Live good and true each hour of your life. Let every thought you give utterance to b&amp; not as though there were a day of judgment by and by, when some extreme sentence is to bo based upon it, but as though you yourselves were judge, and sentencing it; and in it the punish¬ ment came upon yourselves by its utterance; and judge them.</page><page sequence="185">SIXTH EVENING. 181 Oh, friends, I do not wonder that some are moved despite themselves, because trained from their cradle upwards in such doctrines as these; frightened by fiends and flames, and bottom¬ less pits, and goblins damned in hell; who can wonder that their better natures are destroyed—that their purer aspirations are blunted They are wrapt up in their own narrow church ; and if you wanted a proof that the doctrine of eternal torment is fraught with misery to human kind, you have it in the fact, that when is is impeached, its defenders cannot allow the utterance of the impeachment against it; but rise, thinking their God unable to defend his own faith, to interrupt its utterance. I will wind up all, by telling you what your doctrine of eternal torment results in, and has resulted in. Men, finding their God condemn men to eternal torment, themselves inflict upon men here a portion of that torment which they see their God not sparing in inflicting hereafter; and Smithfield fires, Leicester furnaces, all resulted from this. ["Prove it."] Proof! I would that proof were lacking in the history of Christianity I would that I had no proof to give! But if you want a proof from tho time when Protestants pressed to death, in the dungeons of Newgate, Catholics who could not love Christ as they did—from the time when the Smithfield faggots were piled round one set of Chris¬ tians by another set, and the flames licked the life from out them —from the time further back, of the Inquisition—from the time further back, when the Christian missionaries, going into Poland, dragooned the people into Christianity, and impermeated them with love and truth in cauldrons of boiling oil;—there you have the proofs of the frightful nature of the doctrine, which makes men monsters, and prevents them being men. Oh, sir, to-night— in dealing with this question—I ask you, if you can, to tell me what you mean by it. What is your notion of eternal existence Am I to live in my body, or without my body AVhat is to live Where is it to live? Do not tell us of heaven above. Tell us what you mean,—what you think, what you hope about it. If you have knowledge, give us it; and if you have none, confess that you have none,—that you have prostrated your intellect at the threshold of the Unknown, and ceased to think about it, because it is far easier to say, " I believe," than it is to think and grapple with the truth, and give it out. To-night we are met for the last time, but I challenge you, if you have aught to say of the conduct of infidels, or of infidelity, say it. Array church to church. I will meet you, scot to sect; I will meet you, man to man; I will meet</page><page sequence="186">1S2 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. you, and against jour church I will put ours, and see which is worsted in the encounter. Mr. Barker :—I thought, when my friend commenced, that we were going to have something in the shape of an argument through the whole of his speech. But the simple fact of an expression of feeling, which I regret myself, on the part pro¬ bably of both parties—for it was the cheer that called forth the hiss—has so disconcerted him that he has turned round, according to his own showing, to make an attack upon a church which he calls my church, but which I know nothing about. I have nothing much to say about his definition in the beginning, except that it is altogether a fallacy. I will tell you why; it has not touched the essence of the question which he started with, as to what is life. AAre are told that life is the sum of functional activities. Wrhat are functions? I suppose any schoolboy present, nearly, could tell the meaning of the term, if he were at liberty to speak. Are the functions life, or are they moved by the life AVhat are the parts of a steam-engine Are they the engine You say yes; so they may be, as to its fabric, but are they the engine in motion He says we want the steam, that is the stimuli. AVell, what is the stimuli " Caloric and various other gases." AVell, I am sure! How is it that we do not find them moulding some new-fashioned life in our day, after six thousand years How is it that they cannot keep the old fabric alive a little longer Because, if the stimuli be equal to tho maintenance of the functional activity, then there is no reason for dying at all. But if life be something apart from the functional activities or the functions themselves, then I can account for being born on tho one hand, and for dying on the other hand; but neither Iconoclast, nor the writer he has quoted, nor myself, nor any other man, can define life. No. I say that life, as to its essence, is a mystery— the life of tho spider as much as the life of the man. You may see its functions ; you may anatomize it; you may trace its physiology; you may physiologically determine a very great deal about its chemical activities or chemical results, but you cannot define the life; and I defy any man to tell you what life is, as to its essence. We have been very sagely told that death is the negation of life. What a truism I am very much obliged to my friend for that bit of information I deny it, though I say that death is the separation of the life from the functions which it acted upon. The functions or organs all remain there when the life is gone, until by some chemical decomposition they have dissolved back again</page><page sequence="187">SIXTH EVENING. 183. to their original dust and earth. If, therefore, it was a question of mere functional activity, the thing would not be so. If it was a question of mere stimuli, the thing would not be so. AVell, he has admitted that with regard to man we want something more than these functions and these stimuli; that is to say, we want the various powers of the mind; and he will be very glad to know whether I speak of them as separate faculties, or as nature in a certain " operant" condition. I do not care in which sense he takes them, nor which definition he gives. It is no matter for me whether, for scientific purposes, I take conscience as a separate power of the mind, or speak of it as the whole mind acting in a given direction. The thing amounts to the same ; it is the man acting. And what is the Ego—what the " I am "—acting in this matter And this conscience does not simply involve sensation; but moral susceptibilities. AVe have had a thorough jumble to-night about sensation and consciousness. Now, what is sensation? AVe are told that there is no happiness and no misery but what results from the sum of sensational life and activity, and the converse. Well, if you mean to say that I do not have the pleasure of eating except when I eat, that is very likely true; that is sensational. But I sometimes, when I go home very hungry and tired, almost feel as if I could taste the beef before it comes to my teeth. That is sensational, I suppose I don't think it is, except by an act purely mental; namely, the recollecting something that was sen¬ sational a little while ago, perhaps. And if there be a power in the mind, in the absence of actual sensational activity, in any one ease that affords pleasure, whether by recollection or anticipation, then there is a something which wo call the mind—the man—which is distinct from the sensation, and of which the sensation is only a part—an instrument of action, and enjoyment, and pleasure. But I appeal to any child present to-night whether he is not capable of certain states of pleasure, or the converse, which have no connexion with sensational life whatever, but which are purely states of mind. A lad goes and steals something from his father's bureau. His father has not found him out yet. He has not suffered anything for it at present; but he knows he shall. Is that sensational? It is purely at present a mental condition. When ho gets the rod on his back it will be sensational. And the possibility, nay, the certainty, of this distinction between that which is purely sensational in our every day life, and that which is reflectional, if I may coin a word, makes man to be distinct from the animal creation beneath him, and is the great distin-</page><page sequence="188">184 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. guishing element between an intelligent moral agent, and the mere beast that perisheth. My friend wants to know what kind of personal existence we shall have after death Both body and soul; that is plain enough, I should think. But if he means to ask whether it is to be body and soul in precisely the same condition as now, I say no—not as I understand the matter. I am not of course infallible, but I do not expect a body of the same carnal and fleshly elements which I have now. But I do expect a body,—a glorious body, too—like to tho body of Christ after the resurrection ; with which, accord¬ ing to Scripture truth, he ascended up to heaven. Yes, we may use the word " up," notwithstanding all that may be said against it, because it is a mere quibble, and I shall not stop to notice it. I say we shall have the conscious existence that pertains to the mind. AVe shall have also the body. And this doctrine of the separate existence of body and mind, as a question of reason—this doctrine of their absolute separate entity in the person called man, is the real question which he ought to have dealt with, but has not—he ought to have dealt with it according to the general sense of mankind at large, not simply according to the definitions of two or three erratic writers, whether Christian or otherwise. Why did he not take a broad, generous view of things, as laid down by the writers of antiquity, as well as the writers that are found in tho Bible Instead of that, briefly, and as far as his writers would enable him to do it, correctly enough given, he has been treating us to some more of the abuses connected with Christianity, which abuses we are quite as well aware of as be is, and as able to rectify as secularism is. And here let me say, before I forget it, that it is not Christianity that has done this mischief, but the secular element associated with Christianity. If the Christianity of the New Testament had been allowed to go on in the unerring and spiritual way in which it commenced its operations, when all tho powers of the world were against it, and had never been allied with the civil power, either in the person of Constantine or Photius, or Pio Nono, or anybody else, it would have stood clear of many things that have scandalized its name. This was the great masterpiece of strategy on the part of the world powers, and the great enemy of Christianity in the dark ages, in order to bring scandal, and reproach, and contumely upon a name and a faith pure as a sunbeam, and glorious as tho Divine mind. AVe have had some reference to the parables connected with the kingdom of heaven, and as describing the kingdom of heaven. I</page><page sequence="189">SIXTH EVENING. 185 should have liked the parable itself a great deal better than the comment upon it, because it is quite clear to my mind, as a reader of the parables, that we have only had a comment—not the parable itself. AVe have not been told how it was that the foolish virgins were shut out at last, namely, because they had neglected to prepare for the feast, and, therefore, were not worthy of it. We have not been told how it was that the man from whom the talent was taken had it taken from him, namely, because, having formed an impression concerning the Great Master of the kingdom which was erroneous and improper, and having acted upon that impression, he placed himself in a position where he was not worthy to come in amongst those who did come, and receive the rewards that they received. Then, the very way in which my friend has put this matter is fatal to his own argument. He says that it is a matter of injustice on the part of God to require as much of one man in proportion to his ability as of another. AArhy, I thought there was nothing fairer in arithmetic than the law of pro¬ portion. And I think there is nothing fairer in morals than the law of proportion; and if the man with one talent had made one more, as the man with two made two, and the one with five made five, he would not have been cast away as a slothful servant. AVe have had something about Dives and Lazarus, but not what is in the parable. AVe have in the parable the fact that poor Lazarus had been a breadless, wounded, sore man, lying at this rich fellow's gate day by day, and with nothing but the dogs to lick his sores; not allowed the very crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. AAre have not been told what was said to Dives— carrying out the language of the figure or parable—" Thou in thy lifetime rcceivedst thy good things, and Lazarus his evil things : now he is comforted, and thou art tormented." AAre have not had a word of that. That is the very essence of the parable, and if that be a representation of Divine injustice and unkindness, when the whole spirit, and language, too, of tho thing is a plea on behalf of poverty, wretchedness, and sorrow, against oppression and iron-handed iniquity and riches among wicked men, I know not what is justice or injustice. And now I shall try and build up something for my friend to pull to pieces. And, in the first place, I shall say that upon the atheist's own principle he is not able to disprove a future life. Tho atheist looks upon matter as eternal, and man as only a certain mode of material existence. AVell, if that be true, how does he know but that the next mode of existence may be just</page><page sequence="190">•186 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. precisely that which our Bible teaches is a state of rewards and punishments?—for it is quite clear from the history of matter—as we are both, I suppose, prepared to admit—that she has under-1 gone, somehow or other, several distinct modifications and mani¬ festations. And, therefore, the atheist is utterly unable by any fair reasoning to show that it is untrue per se,'that the next condition of our being, or the next mode of our existence, will not be what we believe it to be as laid down in the Bible. Moreover, if there were but the barest possibility of this, it would be well for us to reason as old Socrates did when he spoke to Phacdon, one of his pupils that stood by him just before he took his cup of poison. He said, " I argue thus, my dear Phaedon; I find my way of arguing is highly useful. If my propositions prove true (that is, the propositions he had already given to thorn to show the immortality of the soul), it is well thus to believe them. If after my death they be found false, still I reap the advantage in this life, that I have been loss affected by the ills that accompany it." So that he regarded the hope of immortality as something inspiring and beneficial, and not erroneous and injurious. Again, he said to Simmias, " All thinking men will be positive that the state of the soul, if it be immortal, is absolutely such as I have represented it; and they will find it worth while to run the risk, arguing upon this principle, for what risk is more inviting, or what can more charm us than the blessed hope? " (referring to an immortal life). Irrespective of the being of a God, or the immor¬ tality of the soul—points which I thought my friend would have applied himself to in connexion with this argument—it is im¬ possible for him, or any one, to show by mere reasoning that there is not a future life. The interests of body and mind are separate things, and frequently antagonistic. How can this be accounted for, if there be no difference between them The soul is immortal, as is evident from the noble powers and operations it is able to carry on, in thinking, willing, and purposing; still further, in its being able to ascend above all material objects and sensations into a region of pleasures and enjoyments even now, and to be conversant with objoets, propositions, and truths, which have no necessary connexion with material things whatsoever. The next branch of my argument will be the universality of the belief in a future life. I shall only give a few illustrations— no argument here. The Magians who prevailed in Babylonia, Persia, Media, Syria, all admitted the doctrine of a future life, and of rewards and punishments connected with it. Zoroaster, in</page><page sequence="191">SIXTH EVENING. 187 the time of Darius, held the doctrine of one Deity, independent, self-existent from eternity, and that under him there were two angels—the angel of light, author of all good; the angel of dark¬ ness, author of all evil. He also held that the angel of light, with all his followers, would, after a severe contest in this present life, rise to an existence of purity and happiness; while the angel of darkness, with his followers, would sink down into a condition where they would meet the sad consequences of their deeds. The well-known heaven and hell of Plato conveys to us tho same doc¬ trine. The descriptions and allusions of the poets are also remark¬ able in relation to this great question, with all its phemonena. Homer tells us, for instance, of the descent of Ulysses into hell, and Minos in tho shades below distributing justice to the dead tribes around his tribunal; and as giving irrevocable judgments which, decided their eternal state. Ovid and A'irgil wrote upon the same principle in their poems. They tell us of a Tantalus who, for the loathsome banquet made to the gods, was set in water up to his chin, with a pear hanging close to his lips, and who, notwith¬ standing, suffered raging thirst and hunger; of the fifty daughters of Danaus who, for the massacre of their husbands in one night, were condemned to fill a barrel full of holes with water out of the rivers of hell; of Ixion fastened to a wheel and whirled about perpetually by its swift motion; of Sisyphus, the robber, who had eternally to loll a stone up a hill, which, when he got it nearly to the top, fell to the bottom, so that he had his work to repeat over again. AVhy do I mention these things I mention them to show that somehow or another—it is for us to discuss how by and by—that somehow or other, in the minds of poets and philosophers, of kings and peoples, of heathens and Jews, aud Mahommedans as well as Christians, there have been, and there still are, these convictions of another life—a life far different to this—a life which has its doctrine of rewards and punishments—things which we are prepared to deal with, when the argument requires, in their proper order. The barbarous tribes, too—not the cultivated sons of men— but the barbarous tribes also have their beliefs in this direction. Tho inhabitants of the Society Isles have their Itovah, or deity, whom they worship—which worship is to make them happy for cvei1. The Friendly Isles, Pellew Isles, the Kalmue Tartars, the Hindoos, tho Mahommedans—all these people have their beliefs in a future life. 1 come now to show, from the constitution of tho human mind itself, that there must be a future state. The attitude of the mind towards moral truth is a feature of this argument. That aspect</page><page sequence="192">188 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. of " nature operant," which we call conscience—either the soul or something in the soul which every man has, somehow or another, and cannot get rid of—for every man, ah! the secularist as much as I, though in another direction, has a sense of right and wrong —the pagan, and the Jew, and the Christian, all the world over, acknowledge the distinction between the two things, though very often they call the evil good and the good evil; yet tho acknow¬ ledgment of the distinction is itself a phenomena of mind and morals which it is utterly impossible lightly to treat with or set aside in an argument of this kind. AVhenec has come that moral sense It is utterly impossible that it should have grown up out of innate and insensate matter. It can have no reference to it whatsoever. It is something connected with mind; and not till you have ascertained with a degree of proximate truthfulness what mind is, can you account for it. And yet you have it to account for, with all the faiths in the world, true or false, which the con¬ science has endorsed, which men have acted upon, and in acting upon which their conduct has been materially influenced towards their fellow-men. Mark some instances now of remorse, as another action of con¬ science. The imperious Belshazzar, in the midst of his scene of. feasting, trembled like an aspen leaf, and was as a dead man at the sight of the mystic writing on the wall. AVhy was it The treacherous Tiberius was tormented with the most torturing agonies as the just reaction of his excessive cruelties. AVhy was it Tacitus says that he sent a letter to the senate, in which he opened his wounded breast in such words of despair as might have moved pity in the heart even of his most injured victims. An- tiochus was another whose vitals were devoured by disease, and who died with spectres dancing round his imagination, of those whom he had ill-treated, persecuted, and put to death. And awful was the death of Charles IX. of France. That glorious—not Protestant, but Catholic—persecutor of the Huguenots could not sleep at night in his bed after the St. Bartholomew massacre. AVhy not He could not do it because the victims he had slain he heard—their anguish and their cry, as he thought—in the air, and thus was tortured with agony. There are many other in¬ stances of remorse. If I have time, I will give you one respecting Hobbes, which may interest you. But why is it that there is, deep down in the moral feelings of men, that which approves or disapproves, that which excuses or accuses? You find no such phenomena among tho animal creation, or the beasts that perish.</page><page sequence="193">SIXTH EVENING. 189 But you find man everywhere with more or less distinctness pos¬ sessed of the feeling; and you find all his actions invested with an importance and a reality towards himself and towards others for good or for ill, according as that conscience is directed or mis¬ directed, and that mind is informed or misinformed. And, I say, these are the things,rather than the paltry and insufficient definitions of life which, after all, are no definitions of life, with which we have to deal ere we can come to a legitimate conclusion as to whether we ai-e to live on and on, still acting out this moral phase and phenomena in another state as well as here, or whether we are just to vegetate for a little while, or move along from place to place, like a steam-engine, till all the fire is gone out, and then be done with and turn to rust. Iconoclast :—One great advantage, sir, of these debates is, that, however ignorant we may enter into them, we are sure to obtain knowledge as we pioceed. I am sure, sir, unless you have been as well educated as my friend, that you must have rejoiced to learn to-night that caloric was one of the gases. You also must have been delighted to learn to-night from his speech that conscience and consciousness have the same signification. I was not aware of either of those great "truisms"—[Air. Barker:—Nor L]—which came from my friend " operant " in the course of his speech. I leave them with him for a moment. AAre have some more to deal with, but there are others which lequiie to be treated in a different way. My friend says that my definitions are paltry. He has not tried to give you any better. Ho says that they are false. Beyond putting two or three questions, which I shall answer, he did not endeavour to show where they were false; and I will tell him why. He did not because he could not. I will tell him next that, evidently, from the language he used, he did not understand the meaning of the words he was dealing with; and that when he talked of only a few petty thinkeis having dealt with the question of the ability to discri¬ minate between the cognition and the consciousness of it, he, in thus talking, admitted that he had not read one of the school of writers which,headed by Sir AVilliam Hamilton on the one side, and Victor Cosin and others on the other side, have most ably debated this, which to my friend is a blank page of metaphysics. He has asked me whether, if I define life as the aggregate of organic functional activity, a function is life, or part of life. I define man as the sum of the parts and qualities generally designated by the word man, and our friend turns round to me and says, " If</page><page sequence="194">190 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. I take a part away does the man remain ?" What does he mean If I take away a finger, does the man remain? Yes; but we understand differently of a man with one finger short, or an arm short, than we do of a man who has complete functions. And each function you take away—each function you negate—each function you destroj'—you have so much the lesser manifestation of life. Life is not function, but life is the result—the totality of functional activity. Life is the sum of functional activity. Life is not the function, but ' life" is the word we use to express the totality of organic functional activity ; and if my friend is not acquainted with the meaning of words, then I can only say that in this debate I shall trust that words which he says should be ordinarily understood, he at least will take common pains to understand them. Not one of you would have conceived, from the discourse we have heard from him, that the question we have met to debate this evening was, "Is the doctrine of personal existence after death, and of eternal happiness or misery to mankind, fraught with error, and injurious to humanity?" He has led us through a number of writers, many of whom never taught the doctrine of eternal happiness or misery at all; and he knows that the only system that he is supposed to advocate that teaches it is the Christian system, which he professes to be here to defend. Had I dealt with Mahommedanism, or any other system, he would have had fair ground of complaint that I had not attacked that which he has come here to defend. However, my friend quotes again from the Bible, and when he does that he always errs most egregiously. He says I did not read the parable of the foolish virgins, although I did comment upon it. I neither read it nor commented upon it. However, that is trivial, because his re¬ marks are equally appropriate when he replies to what I do not say as when he replies to what I do say. My friend says that my definition of life is a fallacy, and goes on to say that no one can tell anything about the essence of life. AVill he be kind enough to tell me, when he rises again, what he means by " essence of life ; " and if he does not mean anything by it, why he uses words to which he gives no meaning. Then he speaks about the idea which everybody has got—and curiously enough he started by telling you that no one had any idea of it—of what he was pleased to call the essence of life. Now, if they have not got it, how can it be universal? Our friend says, firbt, that he has not got it; next, he tells us that it is universal. How both these propositions can be consistent one with another I da not know. If he has it, let him tell us what his idea of a soul and of immortal life is. If he has not got it, he cannot tell us; but if</page><page sequence="195">SIXTH EVENING. 191 he has, he must tell us, or we shall bo obliged to assume that he cannot tell us because he does not know. Our friend tells us that death is not the negation of life; and yet, most remarkably, while he has said my definitions are fallacious, he has also said they ar&lt;; correct as far as I can make them. AVhat he meant by these two statements, except something that should occupy his time, I do not know, and I shall be glad to hear him explain; but he went on. He was not satisfied with telling me that my definition was fallacious—he had a hotter one. He says that death is the separation of life from tho functions. Now, the man who is prepared to give a definition should be prepared to give an expla¬ nation of it if challenged, and I will submit to the same test. What is it that is separated ?—and what is it that it is separated from Our friend has defined death to be the separation of life from the functions; will he tell me what is separated—what becomes of what is separated—how he knows that it is separated; and if he is obliged to tell us that he knows nothing about it, how he dare talk about that, the only foundation for his talking about which is, his entire ignorance upon the subject.—[Shame!] — That is very shameful, I agree with you; but whether it is shameful on that side of the debate or on this, the end of the debate must decide. It is shameful where theerroris accompaniedbyignorance, and a pretence to knowledge; but it is never shameful where the party is ready to confess his desire for instruction and to hold him¬ self open for it. If my friend can tell you better than I have told you, I am wishful and willing to hear him ; but I complain that he should pretend that I am wrong, without showing that he is more right. Then he illustrates his thorough acquaintance with the subject with which he is dealing; and with that happy tact for illustration which I will concede to him frankly, he says that if he eats his dinner, he sensates that; but he says, sometimes, when he is going home, he fancies he smells it; and he says that that fancy that he smells it is not sensational, and that is an evidence of the soul! The soul fancies it smells my friend's roast beef cooking in the back kitchen. I shall fancy that argu¬ ment must bo done brown, before we have done with it. I will, however, pass by its funny phase to discuss its serious phase, if it has one. My friend suggests that this is not sensational—that it cannot be traced back to the exercise of sensative ability. [Mr. Barker:—"No."] My friend shakes his head. He is fond of shaking his head; but there is no more in the shake than there was in the argument, and I shall demonstrate that presently. Either the fancied smell can be traced back to the actual sensa¬ tional smell of some meat previously, and to the comparison of a£!*'bAb* --,.KU</page><page sequence="196">192 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. what my friend expects at home; or it cannot, If it can, then my friend's argument, if we may dignify it by the name of argu¬ ment, falls to the ground. And if it cannot, what then My friend will be then placed in a dilemma; and I shall presently show you, that all this which he calls anticipational is but the exercise of memory, of which I spoke in my definition. I spoke of consciousness as immediate knowledge of the present, and of memory as immediate knowledge of the past; and when my friend is what he calls anticipating sensation, he is but memory- ing some previous sensation, and there is no mental act but may be traced back to the operance of the sensative ability. Our friend has also said, that the distinction between man and what he would term the lower orders of the animal kingdom is, that man has refiectional ability, and that the other animals have not. Now this happens, first of all, not to be true. It is not true that animals cannot memory this consciousness of cognition. Our friend has made the assertion; I ask him to endeavour to prove it, and when he tries, T will give some instances to disprove it. And then, how much nearer to the question of the truth of the personal existence after death are we, if it were so The ability to memory is only manifested during vital organic existence. AVhen what we term the living state has ceased, what evidence of the exercise of the reflectional ability which distinguishes man from the beast have you? I put tho question to my friend, " How do you expect to exist when you live again, after death ?" and he says, " Oh, I will make that plain enough, both body and soul." AAfhat is your soul? You never tried to explain it to me. What do you mean by " body " as distinct from " soul," and what by "soul" as distinct from " body" I never used the word; and I tell you, you have no meaning to it, and I defy you to give one when you rise again. Then you say that both body and soul must exist, but you say the body will not exist as it is now. How do you know that And if you do not know anything about if, how dare you say it You say it will exist in just the same state as Jesus Christ did after his resurrection. Then will you eat broiled fish and honeycomb, and is that a diet fit for man after he has risen from the dead If not, what do you mean by referring to the ease of Christ as an illustration Is it necessary for a dead man when he rises again to eat'? If not, did Christ eat unnecessarily If so, do the dead who rise again do unnecessary things I did not take the illustration; you did. You are happier with illustrations than I am; explain it when you rise again. You say that with regard to Lazarus I did not deal fairly, as I did not quote the text which you did.</page><page sequence="197">SIXTH EVENING. 193 Now, I admit that that was very wrong on my part; I ought to have read it. I will now. There is one thing, however, you imitate my reticence. You do not read the Scriptures so much as I do. Occasionally, you know, you challenge me to read chapters and verses, telling me how grandly you intend to refute them at some future time; and then forget all about them, because you have Antiodius, or Charles IX., or some other great people to deal with. AAre will take Lazarus. You say that Lazarus was not able to get the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. Tell me what part of the Bible substantiates that. I find that he desired to eat them; but my friend goes further, and says that his desire was not gratified. You put it that it was not; that the rich man would not give him the crumbs. I do not say you do not know better than the Bible. I hope that in many things you do. But tell me how you know it. You say I ought to have told you what it says about punishment and reward. It says that Abraham said to the rich man, " Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things and likewise Lazarus evil things : but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented." And I say that it was no reason why ho should suffer torment for ever in hell, because he happened to be happy and comfortable on earth. It was not alleged that the rich man did wrong—that he committed any crime, that he uttered one falsehood, or that he ever told an untruth. All that is alleged against him is that he was rich, and all that is alleged in favour of Lazarus is that he was poor; and I can say that the doctrine of the Bible is to beguile men to be content with poverty, that other men who take advantage of their credulity may covetously trick them out of their rights. Mr. Barker :—I should be very glad if I could get my friend to distinguish between things that differ. One of his first objec¬ tions was to my illustration respecting the difference between the body and soul, between the life and the functions of the life, in the case of the man with a finger or with an arm gone. Now he has made a round, broad assertion to this effect, that because there is one finger, one hand, or one arm gone, there is so much of the life of the man gone. The man is so far imperfect. Now we shall seo that I have not misrepresented Iconoclast's idea, even if I have not taken the exact words he used. He wants to make it appear that this simple circumstance makes the man imperfect! It makes the man's body imperfect. But am I to be told, that because a man has lost his finger, he is the less intellectually perfect—that he is the less sensationally perfect? Am I to be told that he is the K</page><page sequence="198">194 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. less capable, with few exceptions, of performing the duties, the relations, the labours of a man I saw a woman not very long since with both arms off, nearly at the elbow; and I was very much distressed indeed at her condition. I thought I should like to ask her some curious questions. I said, " Have you any feeling in these stumps ?" for she was actually waiting at a counter in a tobacconist's shop. She said, " Yes." " AVhat sort of feeling is it ?" " I feel all the four fingers and thumb, just the same as I used to do before my arm was taken off." I could not believe it, but she said, " I do." And I believe that that testi¬ mony could be corroborated by other instances of persons who have lost their limbs. I stand corrected, if physiologists and anatomists say it is not so, provided they will say they have had a limb off, and then find it is not so. But if this be the case, then you see that the sensational power—whatever be its nature— whatever its relation to mind—is not essentially connected with the mere organism of the man—not in its details, at any rate. A great French philosopher has told us that the seat of life—its radical part—is not larger in the brain than the point of a pin would cover; and that if the brain be punctured at that particular point, instan¬ taneous death is the result—the separation of the functional power from the vital essence. My friend wants to know what is the essence of life. I told him before that I did not know, and that he does not; but we do not require to know the essence of life ere we can know whether that which lives can live on. It is altogether another question whether the life is to continue, from that which concerns the nature or essence of the life. I may not be able to define the thing either in its essence or its origin, but I may be able to argue, and from the clearest reasoning to prove that that which now is can continue; and, more than that, that it is impossible for it not to continue. If he would thus distin¬ guish between things that differ, we should come to a very ami¬ cable understanding, and strike off some of those points on which we are now thoroughly opposed to each other, in sentiment if in no other respect. He demurs to my illustration respecting tho sensations—the beef, and so forth. Now, I never said that the difference between man and the animals arises entirely on account of the difference between sensation and reflection, or memory. I said that reflection and moral ability, or moral feeling, were the great distinguishing features between men and animals—not simply reflection. I know that there is that in animals which approxi¬ mates to the reflective; and yet I am not quite sure if we could not disprove that it is reflection. But there is not that which is moral in the animal creation as there is in man everywhere, and</page><page sequence="199">SIXTH EVENING. T95 under every phase of human life, however false their standard of virtue, and however ineorrect their estimate of vice. And it is the moral nature of man more than the metaphysical aspect of him that has reference to a future life. It is this, and this mainly, for which he lives now ; or he might as well have been a donkey or a cow. And if he is to live afterwards, it must be because of the difference of that soul of his which goeth upwards jfrom the soul of the beast which goeth downwards—as the wise man has said in a book which some misunderstand, and which, perhaps, we may hear a little about to-night-—the Ecclesiastes. I was talking, when I sat down, about the universal impression upon the human mind that there is a future life. I shall go a step further in that argument. I want to know how it is that man is so insatiable in his thirst for fame—posthumous fame How it is that he is not content to die as the rest of the sentient about him die—as the beasts die—but would, if he had the power, leave a memory behind him—a fame, a name, a monument? How is it that he raises a costly temple to some idol god, of which he has no idea, Iconoclast tells you! It is very strange that the thing both is and is not at the same time ; for without the idea it is utterly impossible to pay worship—which man does pay, everywhere, in some form or other, to some deity or another. How is it that he rears palaces as well as temples, and other build¬ ings and monuments, to his own memory ; and even on his dying bed is anxious that men should think well of him when gone— not take his name in vain, though they may with impunity take his Maker's name in vain? The animals have no such aspirations as man has. They have no method, if they have, of com¬ municating them to us. AVe can communicate, I think, to them and why not they to us If they had this thing, we should see it indicated in their actions; we should see it in the manner in which they arrange their plans for their own comfort and the comfort of their offspring; and in a great many other ways we should discover it among them, if they had it. The moral powerf of man are essentially different from the mere reflective powers. A mere act of memory or recollection has nothing in,it essentially moral or immoral, but it may become the means of a moral or immoral state of mind; and an immoral state of mind, by the images it calls up from the past, or the things it calls in from the future, may so influence the conscious being and the actions of the man, that both his own mind shall be affected thereby, and his conduct externally be contrary both to the laws of God and man. These moral powers have been in some men in a highly cultivated condition by the light of nature, apart from the light K 2</page><page sequence="200">196 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. of revelation which we believe in. This love of moral distinctions brought Regulus to torment rather than tell a lie ; and yet he was a heathen. It brought Phoeion, the heathen, to suffer the rage of a vile mob, because he would reprove them for their vices rather than hold his tongue. It brought Damon and Pythias— as the schoolboy knows, that stands up to tell the tale and recite the piece in a common day-school—to love one another unto the death, in such a manner that their cruel tyrant king was melted by the sight, and asked for a shaie in their love, and prayed that they might live and love together. Now there must be some¬ thing in man which has a reference to that which lies beyond the present brief state, where virtue and vice are for the most part mixed up in wild confusion and contest, which are the marks of a place of probation and not perfection—the marks of school days and not of home—the marks of a beginning and not a termination. And that is how we look at the present life ; as just the infantine aspect of a being that is capable of endless life, and of endless improvement, onwards and upwards, until it becomes like the divine itself. And Christianity is the only thing that recognises this fact. Heathenism itself has toiled after it; has said it might be so; has hoped it would be so; and has thought that some day it would be known to be so. But no voice, until the voice of a Hebrew prophet, and the Messiah, the Saviour of the world, came to our earth, ever brought the life and immor¬ tality to light in such a manner as to explain to man how he came, and what he is, and where he is going, and how he will be situated when he gets into the other next of being. I know that when the doctrine of a future life, as taught in the Scriptures, comes to be looked at in the details, it is possible for a man to raise numerous objections to it. Christians do, one among another. They have their different views upon it. But the fact of the details of the thing not being perfectly understood by us, can never for one moment shake the great truth, or render it unimpor¬ tant to realize it, though its details may be beyond our reach— in some respects, at least. And therefore it is I have not cared to go to the Old or New Testament specifically to-night, because my proposition does not name the Bible; it simply names the question of a future life, and whether the doctrine of a future life can be shown to be pernicious or otherwise to the human family. And with that point I shall yet deal before the evening is done, and show, as I believe it, from my heart, that the doctrine of a future life is the highest incentive to excellence and greatness of being that it is possible for the mind of man to think of, or of which it can enteitain a conception.</page><page sequence="201">SIXTH EVENING. 197 Iconoclast :— In this, the closing speech on my part in this debate, permit me to entreat on both sides your kind patience until I have done. And permit me also, when my friend rises, to entreat for my friend the same that I ask for myself. Our friend has to-night told you that he has avoided the Old and the New Testaments, because he felt that there were objections which might arise from the Old and New Testament Scriptures. That is the sum of his last statement, if it means anything at all. And if it is not—and I thank you for your kindly answer to my appeal—if it is not, then what does his conduct prove This is a discussion between the Christian and the Secularist. I come here to challenge Christian doctrines. I come here to challenge the Bible doctrines; my friend comes here to defend them, and he has not ventured to tell you any system which teaches the doctrine of eternal happiness or misery for mankind after death, besides the Christian; and if he reserves this until his last speech, then I shall say that he is absolutely unfair in not giving me the opportunity of answering. Now, our friend has told you something about the soul of man that goeth upwards, and the soul of the beast that goeth downwards to the earth, and that is the nearest attempt he has made to-night to quote Scripture in favour of the existence of the soul. There are two or three little objections to his quotation—the first is, that it is not in the Bible—but that is a trifling objection that will apply to many other of my friend's quotations. But as I wanted the opportunity of referring to the verse I have no doubt he meant to quote, I am glad he has given it me; and I will do it. " I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them : as the one dieth, so dieth the other. Yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast; for all is vanity. All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. AVho knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth AArhcrefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion : for who will bring him to see what shall be after him?" Now, our friend has read these two words, " spirit," as though they were soul. 1 quote from Ecclesiastes, chapter the 3rd, beginning with the 19th verse—the verse in which my friend used the word "soul" being the 21st. Now, I have a satisfaction in addressing my friend. I know hj is a great Hebrew scholar. I know he has quoted Hebre v</page><page sequence="202">198 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE, several times during thi&lt;* debate. I, as a poor student in these matters, have followed him at a respectful distance. But I have a satisfaction in addressing him, knowing that he, with his much greater classical acquirements, will be able to set me right; and I ask him whether the word " rook," twice repeated in the Bible, is not the same word translated "cool of the day"; and I ask him whether it is not a cool thing to make use of the word in that fashion. I ask him whether it does not signify " air in motion " ; and, if so, how he dares to misconstrue and misquote a text, even in our translation of the Bible, bad as it is, is bad enough, and in the Hebrew would be a great deal worse. I pass this, because I intend to occupy the remainder of my time in summing up this debate. The more especially because my friend has not added one word to his previous speeches. He has not told you the meaning of the word " soul." When I told you that he did not know what the essence of life is, he did not venture to tell you why he used the word, but only spoke of the separation of life from the functions. And when he told you that a man deprived of his finger or arm was not an imperfect man, he told you that which was simply nonsense or absurdity ; because the instance he gave would only go to show that the woman was able to recollect sensations which she had in her arms or fingers, not that she was able to sen^ate with the arms or fingers at that time. And my friend, when he asked me to distinguish between differences, should be able, at any rate, to pursue that course once for a time in the debate to enable me to imitate him. AYe have met six nights, and we may on the whole congratu¬ late ourselves on the quietude in which the debate has passed through. AVe began on the first night with an instance of my friend's ability, who discovered an angel that was not in the Bible ; and then, faking us to the animal kingdom, of which he has refreshed my recollection to-night by another journey, he restricted his experience to calves. We progressed from calves to elephants and fleas, and have come back to-night to donkeys and cows. I leave my friend with his farm-yard experiences, and return again to the subject. On the second night our friend threatened me with Robert Dale Owen and the National Re- Jormer. lie had them with him — the passages noted—the pages marked down. Dared he read them He has been carefully reticent. Strong, he has been merciful; and unless he has reserved them till his last speech, I have a right to expect that he will fulfil his threat. If he has reserved them, he is waiting till I have no opportunity to return the blow. Then the third night of the debate our friend got strong. He found that</page><page sequence="203">SIXTH EVENING. 199 there were portions of the Bible that were unfortunately intro¬ duced, and he told you that they were not the subjects of debate, but that if they had happened to be, he would deal with them ; and he challenged Iconoclast to meet him on some future occasion. The challenge taken up on another night, my friend became modest again ; and unless he has reserved the acceptance of it till his last speech, with a view to give greater effect and eclat to the con¬ clusion, he has retired from that. On the next night he goes into the question of slavery, and late in the evening he told you that on the following night he is going to explain it. He doe3 not. On the fifth night he does still more. In his last speech he challenges me to read chapter and verse—chapter and verse previously referred to in the debate touching the right of a man to steal a woman, rob her of her virtue, and turn her out in the wide world to go whither she would. Our friend defied me to read it—said it was not in the book—and promised to explain it on the next evening as he could not do so that night, as it was his last speech—he having left it to his last speech. But he has left his defence of it till a time when it will be a most glorious one—when there can be no refutation of it. I leave that, and I ask him what have we on this side, and what has he on that to regard from this debate One thing we must all regard. I admit that a much better advocate might have been found for the views which I have been the poor exponent of than myself, but all the weakness is the weakness of the advocate, not of the cause. But taking it that my friend has done—and I believe he has done —the best for his side, for he has carefully avoided every point of danger ; he has been a clever soldier; he has studied the strategy of war; and with the ability of a McClellan he has kept the main body out of danger till the Confederates have got away. And I ask my friend what he expects to have done during this debate—how many persons can he have convinced, when he has refrained from dealing either with the Old Testa¬ ment or with the New, as I put them before you, and when he, to-night, is obliged to go to one country and another for the purpose of convincing you of that which, if God had made a revelation to man at all, should have been more clearly deduced from God's revelation to man than in any other place My friend, to-night, has gone to people's dying, dismal, frightened hours; and I thought he was goiilg to begin a series of infidel death-beds. Has he reserved that till his last speech. Have we Hobbe's, Voltaire's and Paine's death-bed scenes reserved till his last speech, or do you mean to fill up your time without delaying with the subject at all I have dealt with your death-beds. I</page><page sequence="204">200 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. have taken David's, and the dying scene of Christ, and I chal¬ lenged you to meet them. You never did, but you said, " Some other time, some other place, some other debate." I say it is here, in a tilt, where we are met, thought clashing with thought as sword with sword, that we should take up those questions-—and not say we will do so on some other occasion. I say that we have met, think what you will, to bring secularism and Christianity face to face. I have put the subject before you as well as I was able, though my friend says I do not understand it. AVhen I ask you if I, not able to understand it, have left so much he has thought fit to avoid, what would a better man, with keener ability, more power, greater eloquence, greater grasps of those mighty truths which I humbly strive after, have done I have had no God to help me as he has. I have had no Holy Spirit to inspire me as he has. I have not had the strength of a revela¬ tion behind me. But I will tell you what I have. I have bright eyes around me inspiring me on every side. They do not diaw inspirations from death-beds lighted up from the lurid fires of a blazing hell, which you dare not defend when pressed with it. I will tell you what inspirations thej draw. They draw inspira¬ tions from every source of truth, of youth, of beauty, of nobility, of life—not from the history of a church, jour own records of which are obliged to say of its crimes and licentiousness that which I referred to the other evening, and which you never dared to challenge. You talked of the Reign of Terror in a late speech. Do you intend to go to it again I challenged you to do it when 3 ou stepped on to it for a moment; but the chance has gone by. Don't do it in your last speech, when I have not the oppor¬ tunity to refute your unjust attacks upon that glorious revolution, when people rose above that licentious court and that tyrannic priesthood—that flagrant union of church and state; you call it Catholic Church; I call it Christian Church. Your book says, " by the fruit ye shall judge of the tree." You say that if Chris¬ tianity had been different from what it is it would have been better—if it had not associated itself with kings and linked itself with the state, and made friends with monarchs and powers, it would have been something else. It is because of what it has been, and what it is, that I impeach it. The fruit of the tree is rotten ; the trunk of the tree is rotten; and the axe of free thought is riving it daily, and you see not the sap of strength and vitality, but rottenness—the rottenness of an ignorant age— the rottenness of an old book you dare not defend—the rottenness of proscriptions which you say are for an ignorant people. Chapter and verse I ask for ; and you are obliged to say they are</page><page sequence="205">SIXTH EVENING. 201 mistranslated. Our friend comes as an exponent of God's will to man. I come as a student of rising thought, of the endeavour to know—as a student of the great problem of life. I have no revelation ; I have no bitter excommunications—no anathemas to hurl upon you ; but I have this to say, the wide book of humanity lies open before you. Turn its pages over. I can offer you no inducements to come here. I admit that to be a free thinker is to be an outlaw, according to the laws of England. I admit that to profess your disbelief renders you liable at the present moment to fine and imprisonment and penal servitude. I admit that that is the statute law of England. I admit that if you are free enough to say you are an infidel, your evidence may in a court of justice be rejected, and that so you may be robbed. I admit we have not wealth and power on our side—-power which the Chris¬ tian Church, through eighteen centuries of extortion, has managed to get together. But I tell you what we have. AVe have the pleasant consciousness that we make the public conscience and public opinion step by step with each thought we give out and each good deed we do. Our church is not a narrow church, nor narrow chapel, nor Bible sect, but the wide church of humanity, covered by no steeple, with texts preached from no pulpit, but with each man as his own priest, working out his own salvation, and that of his fellow's, too—not on his knees, but on his feet, with clenched hand and nervous brain, fighting wrong and asserting right, and striving to make humanity freer. Mr. Barker :—As I do not undertake in my last speech to notice the conduct of the debate or to review it, but rather to leave other people to do it for me, I have little or nothing to answer in Iconoclast's last speech. There is, perhaps, one thing I should notice, and that is the great " ado" he has made about my using the word " soul" instead of rooaeh, or "spirit" from the book of Ecclesiastes. AArell, I suppose he knows that as Christians we interchangeably use these two words in our common every-day language, and for the moment it did not occur to me that I was in debate, or else I would have used the word " spirit " instead of " soul." But if I had used the word " spirit" instead of " soul," it would not have altered my argument. There is still found in the book the fact that the writer of it says that the soul or the spirit of the beast goeth downward and the spirit of man goeth upward. " All go unto one place; all are of the dust; all turn to dust again. AA'ho knoweth the spirit of man that goefh upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth ?" Now, just one word on the book of Ecetesiastes, and I</page><page sequence="206">202 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. have done with that. It has often been said—and when said by a person unobservant of its structure and intention I am not much surprised at it—that that book teaches the veriest mate¬ rialism that a man can hold. But from what point of view Not the writer's. He lays down in the beginning a great proposition— the reverse of materialistic, and illustrates it step by step from his own past experience, and views it in distinct phases of thought; so that it is an autobiographic argument; and he sums up the book in the last chapter by showing that while it is true of the body of man that like that of the dog it goes to the dust, yet that he has a soul that must stand before God at last—to give account for the deeds done in the body—or, in other words, in whose presence every secret thing shall be made manifest;—and that, therefore, the conclusion, a very proper word to use for an argument when it comes towards the end—the conclusion of the whole matter is this, that a man should " fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, and every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil." It you will take the book of the Ecelesiastes in that form, you will find it instructive and useful. The writer of it once thought that mere know¬ ledge was everything—the summum bonum. At another time he thought that the pleasures of the world—carnal pleasures— were the sum of happiness. At another time he thought that greatness among his fellow men was a thing most to be desired. But twenty-two times in that short book of twelve chapters does he say that he found these things to be what he starts by saying they were, and which is his great proposition for the whole book, " Vanity of vanities, all is vanities, saith the preacher." He bad come back to the old truth that man lives for ever, and that his character and moral condition here will influence the features and character of the life beyond—a doctrine that my friend says I have not been able to show has been held by anybody but the authors of the Bible. I deny it. I have shown that Socrates held it. I have shown that Plato taught it in his " Heaven and Hell," a thing which you must all have read. And if there were time I would show it you from the writings of Cicero—I have all the passages marked down for the purpose.—If my word for it that they are there is not sufficient, then I say let the thing go. My friend gives you assertion, I give you assertion in return until he gives you something else. He says that I have not shown you, and dare not show you, my Bible belief. I shall do it; but I have one other thought to give you before I come to the Bible. I have not quite done with my moral argument, as I call it.</page><page sequence="207">SIXTH EVENING. 203 Now, let me ask whether such a man as Howard, the great philanthropist, and Nero, one of the greatest tyrants that ever oppressed the earth, going into a future state just as they were when they were here, would be perfectly happy in the same place together I want to know, if you multiply the single Nero by a thousand, and the AVhitfields and AA'esleys and Pauls by a thousand on the other side, if a commnnity of persons so essentially different in moral character could be happy and feli¬ citous together The thing is a moral impossibility, and there¬ fore you must have, in the very nature of things, two places, if we are to live again. According to the doctrine of the Old Bible, you must have it. Socrates saw it; Plato saw it; Cicero acknow¬ ledged it in so many words, as the doctrine which men have done wise to receive and believe, as taught them, he said, by the gods. Now I come to show what the New Testament says about this malter, and how it stands in regard to it. I should have done it before if I had had time. 1 am sorry my friend has not time to answer me ; if he likes to answer when I have done, I will not prevent it. I would be the last man to prevent a man from answering what he wishes to reply to. The Bible teaches the following truths:—That man, by his own voluntary transgres¬ sion, and by no other cause, exposed himself to everlasting destruction, or such a moral condition of being as was entirely opposed to happiness and well-being. AAre are taught, therefore, that all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; and that the unbeliever and the immoral shall, in the last day, be punished with destiuction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power (2 Thess. i. 9). AVe are taught in the Scrip¬ tures, in the second place, that this was not the original grand end of creation—that it was the result of the lapse on man's part from the high position in which God had placed him; that it was the result of sin—the perversion of his moral and intellectual powers—the setting of God and his laws at defiance. And, therefore, the AVord of God declares that he has no pleasure in the death of the sinner, though he dies, inasmuch as it was not God's grand end—for grand it could not have been—inasmuch as it was not the great end which God had in creation. God does not desire it. He tells us, in consistency with that idea, in the New Testament, that hell, the place of the wicked, was made and pre¬ pared for the devil and his angels, and not for man. AVe are taught again, by Gospel doctrine, that all to whom the Gospel is preached have a grand opportunity of escaping the wrath to come. This was the key-note of the preaching of John the mmmmmmm</page><page sequence="208">204 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. Baptist, together with the great truth that the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world, was coming after him, and would take away the sins of those who had been awakened to flee from the wrath to come, This is taught most clearly in such passages as Rom. iii. 19—-25; Rom. v. 6—11; where Paul gives us the most complete argument upon the matter, saying, that if you judge by the love of man to his fellow-man— " Scarcely for a righteous man will a man die; yet, peradventnre for a good man some would even dare to die; but God com- mendeth his love toward us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." AVe are taught, again, in the Scriptures, that the future state of the righteous is one of unalloyed purity and felicity, that they are exempt from all care and sickness, and poverty and oppression, and affliction, and from death, too; and live in a state where God shall wipe all tears from their eyes. AAre are taught that the reward of the wicked is not arbitrarily, but justly dealt out, there being a just and equitable reference to character, so that where much has been given, much shall be required: that where a man has sinned wittingly or knowingly, he shall, as it were, be beaten with many stripes, and where he has sinned ignorantly, with but few. Yea, more, the Saviour has given an illustration of this fact, that with regard to the Heathen portion of mankind that have not had the advantage of this Diune revelation, he will give them the benefit of his foreknowledge of what they would have been if he had given them a revelation. I will give you a quotation. He says—" AAroe unto ye, Chorazin and Bethsaida, for if the mighty works that have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes ; wherefore it shall be more tolerable for them in the day of judgment than for you." There the benefit of the Divine foreknowledge is placed to man's account, because the man has not had the advantage of doing what he might have done in other circum¬ stances. Does that look like injustice in dealing out rewards to men in the great day when the white throne shall be set, and the heart-searching Judge of mankind shall appear? Most certainly not. AVe are not afraid of our Bible doctrine, if it be understood. The future punishment of sins is made known to us with the most beneficial intentions. It does not contain the animus of anger and contempt against the sinner which Iconoclast has, in every reference to it, thrown into it. The animus is his, and not the Bible's. The Bible mentions the fact as a solemn, awful fact, necessary in the nature of things. The Bible mentions the fact as a great and glorious warning—</page><page sequence="209">SIXTH EVENING. 205 a preventive—hindering us from coming there, where infallibly we must come if we accept not the alternative—Divine mercy in all its fulness and grandeur. We are told again, by my opponent, that the Bible doctrine of punishment is inconsistent with the Divine character, and injurious to mankind. Now, I want to know how it can be injurious. It may be if erroneously understood, and I think that that was the case with Francis AV. Newman, and others of that school. They were not able to deal with it properly, and so regulate their conduct consistently. Priests and tyrants, we have been told, have brought it to light for the purpose of binding us with fetters, and so on ; but if the universal consent of mankind had revolted against the doctriue-— as if it be irrational it must have done, or all men had been irra¬ tional—then, how can you account for this universal consent, if the thing be false No, no ; it was because the universal conscience of mankind felt that there was a truth in it, that they have been compelled to receive it, not in its simplicity, as it is found in that book, but with additional pains, penalties, and disabilities from their fellow-man, in the shape of hireling priests. But it dis¬ courages human enterprise—we are told that to be great we must have nothing to do with it. AVhat is greatness, then AVbat is progress Is it lawless action, lawless thought, dis¬ guised under the name of free thought Because, if it be either of these things, we don't care for such progress. Punishment, we are told, is an arbitrary thing. No, no; it is a moral classi¬ fication of the universe, according to innate and necessary character; and anything but such a classification of intelligent beings in God's universe would be partiality and injustice in the highest and most eminent degree. AVe are asked whether punish¬ ment be reformatory. My friend has said, during this debate, both that it is and is not, so that I don't know what he means. But I say that punishment is not reformatory, and that it is utterly impossible for it to be reformatory, either among men or in the plan of God. The punishment may give origin to certain states of mind in the criminal which may be the means of reform¬ ing him, but the punishment itself has no reforming power in it; and so God lays before us the probability—tho certainty of that alternative to his mercy and his goodness—necessary punish¬ ment—not because he thinks it will convert a man, for the terrors of the law never did that yet, but because they may act as a schoolmaster, to use the Old Bible phrase, to bring men to Christ, who is able to save them to the uttermost through the mercy of God. Tell me about saving myself! Oh! the idea is fulsome to me. It is ministering to my pride, which</page><page sequence="210">206 MODERN ATHEISM AND THE BIBLE. does not need such service. It is ministering to my vanity, to my sin, to my folly; whereas I need discipline and instruction, and edification. And I can only find these things at the foot of the cross. Ah there, at the feet of One whom I never heard, by Deist, or by Unitarian, or by Socinian, or by Atheist, called " bloodthirsty," until this discussion. I do hope, from the bottom of my heart, that my friend will blot out that sentence from the debate. I will not say that it is not recorded as he gave it. I would rather throw the mantle over it for ever, that it should never be seen, than that it should go forth to the world that he had so far forgotten his manhood, so far forgotten his reason, his common sense, and all the facts of history, as to call Christ " blood¬ thirsty." Oh! men, everywhere, come to him, for " whosoever cometh to him shall not perish, but have everlasting life! " Iconoclast :—I rise with great pleasure for the purpose of moving a vote of thanks to the Umpire, for his conduct through¬ out the whole of this debate; and in doing it, permit me to say, that however much I might desire to say more, my friend must have meant it as a pleasant jest—inviting me to reply to him at this stage of the evening. If he means what he says, he will find me ready to meet him whenever he repeats his invitation. Mr. Barker:—I have very great pleasure indeed in seconding the proposition before the meeting. The resolution having been carried by acclamation:— The Umpire rose and said:—Gentlemen, allow me one word at the conclusion of this discussion. You have been kind enough to give me a vote of thanks each evening. I have been very brief in acknowledging it, because I thought that the proper time to do so was at the conclusion of the discussion. I am obliged to you for your kindness in bearing with my weak¬ nesses and infirmities, and for your general compliance with my requests. AVe have, I believe, got through this discussion as orderly as most discussions have been got through, and I have but one word to say. I am neither judge to sum up nor to pronounce sentence; but I do ask of you that you will kindly weigh whatever arguments have been put before you, and judge of them individually. Allow me a word, for any future occasion when you may come into this room, or elsewhere:—Remember that you come to listen to a discussion, and not to enter into one yourselves. Interrupting a speaker diverts the current of his</page><page sequence="211">SIXTH EVENING. 207 thoughts, and is unfair both to the speaker and to his subject. I merely give this as a word of caution, because it is, I am sure, desirable that you should at all times hear the speaker and judge impartially yourselves. I thank you for your kindness on the present occasion. The proceedings then terminated. London: Benjamin Pardon, Printer, Paternoster Row.</page><page sequence="212">J</page></plain_text>
