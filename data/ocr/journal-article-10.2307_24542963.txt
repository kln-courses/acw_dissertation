Focusing on the specific context of the Napoleonic Wars and in particular the Duke of Wellington and his horse Copenhagen, I show why agency is a continuum, not limited to the complex and intentional acts of a rational man, for instance a field marshal, but extending to basic actions, group actions, and less self-conscious actors, for instance a horse. Therefore, agency can include animals. Any action, however, must be placed into a context of reasons or understandings, the "per tinent context." The place of animals as agents will naturally vary across historical time in great part depending on prevalent contemporary cultural assumptions. In some periods animals have operated as difficult-to-discern "secret agents." I stress the variable and fluid notions of agency that have emerged in posthumanistic and actor network theoretical contexts. And I develop the idea of special associations—what I call unities—in which especially close, disciplined actors are produced, such as the skilled horse-and-rider of the nineteenth century. Ultimately, historical agency is likely always to involve human beings, but there is also space for animals to act with people.

This is the very stuff of history. On reflection, we'll find that animals are all over the past, but assessing their role in history, as actors or objects, is a pressing and challenging question: but, which is it to be, actors or objects? "Anaxagoras declared that plants are animals and feel joy and sadness. . . . Plato indeed states that they feel desire only on account of their compelling need of nutriment." "Anaxagoras and Democritus and Empedocles said that [plants] possessed intellect and intelligence."2 Aristotle records these views about plants, and clearly the clever Greeks pursued a generations-long debate about the mak ing and filling of their key natural-historical categories. The lines between plant, animal, and human being were quite uncertain; a poet's preference summoned some philosopher's disdain. Under our current conditions humanists are more interested in the way that the animal and the mechanical bump up against the human than the way the plant eases toward the animal, but times change. This article moves toward an answer to the question of whether animals have historical agency.3 And if they do, what is its character and how might this affect historiographical projects, whether those focused on animals per se—the arrival of dogs in Australia perhaps—or those in which animals, the latest subaltern (the subaltern's subaltern) have been ignored, notwithstanding their relevant presence. What reader can forget the revolutionary shock of recognizing the historical role of those invisible factors, microparasites such as the smallpox virus, which in William McNeill's hands stole Cortés's heroic thunder?4 As interesting in that Aztec context were what the Nahuatl sources called "deer" and the companion mastiffs, in other words horses and dogs, Europeans' favorite warring co-species.5 For their part, the Spanish never 2.

Acting with animals certainly is historically specific and effective, but what of animals acting? Reflected from the narrative of events, however, an agent or actor is minimally someone without whom things, especially a particular doing, might have been significantly different. A historical individual's relative importance might be signaled by the sense that, as the Duke of Wellington honestly put it: "By God! I don't think it would have done if I had not been there."7 Saying so yourself is not required or attractive, but thinking so is not irrelevant because robust, "clas sic" agency requires intentional action, rational action, and this suggests that the undeniable action is likely to be a knowing one, undertaken by those who knew they could make a certain sort of difference to the intersection of actions and events that figure history forth. Asking whether animals have agency runs into many potential obstacles in principle. When we ask whether domestic animals, specifically companion spe cies, have agency—cats and dogs and horses and cows—the challenge might be even greater, paradoxically greater. Forget the cats and cows for the moment: dogs and horses are often enough intensively trained, and that process is full of ambiguity when it comes to agency, some fascinatingly and positively teased out by people like Donna Haraway.8 But, as Black Beauty saw it when faced with the process of breaking, the loss of freedom to do what you want was the whole prob lem: "he [the horse in training] must go fast or slow, just as his driver wishes. He must never start at what he sees, nor speak to other horses, nor bite, nor kick, nor have any will of his own; but always do his master's will, even though he may be very tired or hungry."9 Some have seen, through a post-Marxist perspective, the way in which animals are labor and often are slaves.10 Yet the historiography of slavery has been one of the best places to see the dynamic rhetoric that transforms brutalized humanity into irrepressible agent, free even when bound, even when often doing another's will." Black Beauty spoke significantly when he indicated that horses were in a master-servant relationship with humans. This means that horses held a superior position to many animals. Dogs and horses are almost unique in their master-slave/servant relationship with people. It was the sort of hierarchical relationship that until fairly recently characterized many if not most 6.

At the foot of the Waterloo Dispatch, the letter by which the Duke of Wellington informed the government of the battle, came the casualty list. A summary, it was divided according to three categories: "British, Hanoverians, Horses."12 Riding-to-war is the animal-human unity that I have chosen as my focal test case of animal agency. My reasons are simple and relatively straightforward: history, both its writing and its popular and specialized consumption, has always floated on warfare and its consequences, on the struggle of political life, blood and blows, and often on the specific fact of the most classic of events: battles. Within that framework, horses, elephants, dogs, and camels have been the most prominent of co-species. The horse-and-rider, however, has been an unparalleled partnership. They sit (or stand) at the center of our remembering and imagining men (and women) at war, and they have done so for a very long time in a great many places.13 There are histories of horses and there will be more of them—San dra Swart's recent Riding High: Horses, Humans, and History in South Africa14 is remarkable and in the vanguard—so if agency can be made meaningful in horse history it is certain to matter. For a variety of reasons, I focus on the early nineteenth century and the Napoleonic wars, in some ways the height of cavalry's thousand-year-old European significance. What is more, assessing agency is especially "natural," if controversial, in the context of battles. After all, battle is sometimes radically transformative, not only ending lives in a flash, but also changing the large historical narrative as well as so many lives near to the field and far away and for years to come. Warfare is col lective business, but individual agency routinely has been a theme of historians' and nations' narratives and explanations of what has mattered: we've focused on heroic kings in the distant past, calculating generals in the modern age. I neither praise nor blame this fact of history and memory but it helps to explain the apt ness of examining war and agency and animals together. If a man in a battle has ever mattered, then it's plausible that the Duke of Wellington mattered, and this in part because his battles mattered, especially, of course, Waterloo. As a piece of historical narrative, that battle is likely to endure, a necessary point for emplotment in European history. When Napoleon's army disintegrated as a fighting force on the evening of June 18, 1815, dispersing in blood and fear through the fog of battle and night, the outlines of European and much world history were settled for a century. At least such grand stories can be plausibly told and they still are. In fact, the hard part is not retelling them; that is part of the reason for my focus too. Another factor makes battle an excellent zone in which to test animals and agency. In battle and in our thinking about battle, the air of reasons and delib 12.

For instance, from a recent book narrating some of the preliminaries of the Waterloo campaign: The sequence of events reflects badly on both Wellington and the Prussians. If Wellington provided inaccurate information, but genuinely believed it, then his understanding of his own forces' deployments was seriously questionable. If he deliberately misled the Prus sians then the implication is that he did not trust them to fight Napoleon at Ligny unless they could be certain of Anglo-Dutch support at Quatre Bras. ... In any event, the Prus sian action at Ligny conformed entirely to the plan of action agreed by Wellington and Blücher. . . . [Wellington] was caught short at Quatre Bras, and fought a decidedly hot action against Marshal Ney, displaying brilliant generalship as he plugged holes in his line with reinforcements as and when they arrived.15 Reasons and judgments are the stuff of such history and of the historian's writ ing too, assumptions of active rational agency infusing sources and historical accounts—the Duke acting by plugging the holes in his line, as it turns out with Britons, with horses, with Hanoverians. Faintly antiquated as this account might seem to a social historian, there is something apt too. The philosopher of history R. G. Collingwood said: rethinking past actors' thoughts was key and it is the presumed shared ground of reason that authorizes such an approach.16 It is reasonable to think that the Duke mattered enough to have made the Waterloo result possible. From not later than six o'clock that morning until at least ten o'clock that night, he was virtually inseparable from the chestnut horse called Copenhagen. For want of a nail, the horseshoe was lost, for want of the shoe, the horse was lost, for want of a horse, the kingdom was lost? Under every great general is a horse. And together they were a unity, a type of being. These two might have been important for the outcome of the battle, but we need to remember that they were also a special, if not at all unique, physical and social construct—the horse-and-rider at war, a rather amazing historical achievement. Considering animals in history forces us to think hard about the character of this disciplined association of species. Of course, there were over 190,000 men and about 40,000 warhorses involved at Waterloo, so the degree to which the Duke or his horse mattered is clearly contestable. But the nature of a modern army meant the odds of a man who was a general mattering among such a mass is very high, and indeed in this case, widely assumed. Needless to say, the same could be said for Napoleon. From these men—rational agency asserts—commands flowed that made other men and horses act in specific ways, the ultimate purpose of which might have been quite opaque to those acting men, as much as to the horses. Let me stress this point. Rational agency is not and shouldn't be thought the key to historical agency, but we need to take it seriously as a core component of at least one spine of the starfish that is agency. We'll consider other, less rational, less atomistic spines in due course. If we have a general sense for what rational, 15. Huw J.

There are two good reasons for asking whether animals have agency: first, they just might and second, people might once have thought they did. In other words, we need to have an answer to our contemporary question of what the state of animal agency can be, but we would always need to probe the question in terms of the specific people and world under historical examination and figure out that perspective, hence the necessity of a historical context. The question of animal agency puzzles in part because for some it comes close to being a contradiction in terms. Certainly, the model of the most rational agent is a far cry from what we expect possible of a pair of horses pulling cannons across the early nineteenth-century Belgian mud.17 From other points of view the question might seem unnecessary as well as untimely, because the significance of agency—traditional agency, especially rational agency—is itself today a problem rather than a ground for clarifying our understanding of animals or anything else. Across the humanities, theoretical doubt about human agency renders the issue of animal agency irrelevant, a train missed.18 There is something else: agency might be the last thing we'd want to foist on an unsuspecting being, because so many sorrows of responsibility and culpability seem to start there and so much domination flows from the confident, yet myopic acting center—the individual, the man, the aristocrat. It is possible that classic tales of war and blood help to hide the way that agency is the fig leaf on our souls or the place they used to be. Agency is the fig leaf on our souls, and once we surrender souls, at least the special rational soul, we are back with Plato's plants and, rather like a lot of things, it is best understood in a more level-headed and leveling way. In other words, as much social theory and posthumanistic reflection argues, perhaps we should abandon notions of agency that start with or assume the specialness of reason, of the individual, of the human.19 Is it any surprise that a good deal of the intellectual foundation of the concern about animals starts, and might end, with a focus on suffering and pain, with broadly hedonistic and utilitarian calculations that reduce agency's and intellect's relevance? Pain and emotion and suffering advance, while reason dwindles in the rearview mirror.20 There are therefore several large questions in the air. What is agency and its varieties? Does it make sense to continue to value it? Does such agency apply to 17. There was a class hierarchy among warhorses too. Pack horses and draft horses, chosen from different breeds, although less admired and noticed, were of course crucial. The human social order somehow had to link with its other animal order, a point notable in a horse-centered fiction from the nineteenth century, Tolstoy's "Strider: The Story of a Horse," which I learned of from Kari Weil, Thinking Animals: Why Animal Studies Now (New York: Columbia University Press, 2012), 100-102. 18.1 feel all credible papers on animals need to refer to Derrida's cat.

If so, in what ways? If it doesn't apply, does this indict the con cept of agency or animals? How might we press these answers into the practical business of doing history, that twisting of present and past? Although much of this article will continue to wonder about the best theoretical posture with which to go forward, we should bear vividly in mind horses who ran on the smoggy slopes of Vitoria and Waterloo, through the brimstone of battle, but especially the "charger" Copenhagen. Like Napoleon, the Duke of Wellington had a favored warhorse. As long-lived Marengo was to Napoleon, so Copenhagen was to Wellington. At Waterloo, Napoleon rode little and mainly used a horse called Desirée, but Marengo was there, lost in the general debacle, fortunately getting captured by a member of Wellington's staff. Horses attracted attention and were valuable, admired, and expensive. For his part, the Duke rode constantly and chose the horse that had carried him well through some of his victories in Spain and France, a chestnut horse of fifteen hands. As was his habit, Wellington stayed on the single horse throughout the battle; this meant that Copenhagen was active with the Duke for something between fifteen and eighteen hours that day. His life before and after Waterloo was noteworthy, and it's fair to say that the horse went on to develop a historical persona of his own, taken by those who knew him directly or by reputa tion as extraordinary and worthy of attention.21 Here are some of the themes that we'll consider in assessing whether an animal like Copenhagen can be an agent. For the sake of argument, we can present the Duke of Wellington as our classic rational agent. Rational agency might be the narrowest sort of agency conceivable. It combines the need for someone—let's keep this individualistic for now—to have done something with an effect that was intended; that requires the intermediation of reasoning, that is, the assessment of a current state of affairs, all sorts of inferences and speculations about the world, based typically on knowledge and experience. We could project this as a sort of myth on any general, but to some extent the ability to do so reflects the effect of Wellington and Napoleon on the military and historical imagination.22 Theirs was the age that created the rational general, as the fighting king receded after the transitional Frederick the Great. It is no surprise to learn that the great analyst and theorist of modern warfare, Carl von Clausewitz, was an officer present during the Waterloo campaign and that he was at that time taking notes, conceiving, and writing up the new analytical vision of warfare and generalship. What's more, Wellington's reputation rose above his sometimes reactionary, always Tory poli tics, upon the publication of the massive Dispatches, that meticulous record of his thinking and writing, which further demonstrated his persistent organizational and planning vision, his bureaucratic skills, as a general from India to Waterloo.23 A remark of his sums up the role of the reasoning imagination in all this: "The whole art of war consists in getting at what is on the other side of the hill, or, in 21.

John Keegan's book on generalship was nicely called The Mask of Command (New York: Viking Penguin, 1987). 23. See Dispatches.</page><page sequence="8">THE TORTURER'S HORSE: AGENCY AND ANIMALS IN HISTORY 153 other words, in learning what we do not know from what we do." Inference is essential. The general was a thinker.24 Of course, between thought and action falls this shadow: the same war that I'm describing by stressing rational agency was also described by Tolstoy. The image of his General Bagration, a man apparently confident in the inefficacy of reason and the certainty of ignorance amidst generalship is also very compelling. No matter what happened, "Prince Bagration bowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected."25 Let us, however, pocket those doubts for present purposes, noting only that Tolstoy was looking back and trying to criticize the supposed brilliant rationality of generals and the idea of reason in history. Whatever else it might be, agency thrives amid calculation and intelligence, but as Donald Davidson, among others, has stressed, we act even when we miss the mark we intended, so intention is crucial but needn't get its object.26 In other words, when Marshal Grouchy took his corps of 35,000 men (and several thou sand horses) away from Waterloo before the battle, he intended to stop the Prus sians from adding their strength to Wellington's. He acted by marching toward Wavre, but he failed, however, to find the Prussians in time and they succeeded in arriving at Waterloo, flanking and overwhelming the French in the late after noon. Grouchy acted, doing something on purpose, but he didn't intend some of the things he achieved—the defeat of Napoleon's army, missing the Prussians. Actions are to some extent at the core of things, but finding intentions carries us into the thicket of descriptions and reasons where history thrives.27 How much of what you do do you have to intend? How is this different for a horse? Given that much of what an action is can be discovered retrospectively or from a different perspective, the mismatch of intention and result might suggest that some animals and humans operate similarly, different in terms of magnitude not kind. We must remember, however, that actions are minimally bodily movements that are under control. Indeed, Davidson goes so far as to conclude: "our primi tive actions, the ones we do not do by doing something else, mere movements of the body—these are all the actions there are. We never do more than move our bodies."28 Moving one's body with a purpose is the action of an agent. If we can work out what "with a purpose" means for animals, then we can probably claim that they act rather than just move. Whether a hellebore following the sun through the day, arching its petals toward the light, is also acting might be a harder ques tion, although I think we know what Empedocles would say. Clearly, the extent to which such a supposed agent can have and articulate beliefs, expectations, goals, or intentions might be important in trying to evaluate the sort or degree of agency possible. How can we know what's happening with 24. Hansard's Parliamentary Debates, Third Series Commencing with the Accession of William IV (London: Cornelius Buck, 1884), 828. 25.

Ibid., 59.</page><page sequence="9">154 DAVID GARY SHAW animals is really one of the key theoretical challenges. Therefore, in considering the sort of highly rational action that the Duke of Wellington engaged in when he ordered the disposition of his forces across the ridge of Mont St. Jean to thwart Napoleon, and contrasting it with the apparently simple action undertaken by a horse who walked to take up a position on the same ridge, we suspect a large dif ference. Yet both seem to be actions, motions of the body in some sense wanted by the doer, intended. Both seem therefore to involve actors. Man and horse. Where is the difference and where the commonality? The difference cannot be in the movement itself but must be in the descriptions or understandings that rightly are attached to or inhere in the action. Every action might have a basic movement at its core, but not every movement is an action. Even the intentions that would seem to be essential to the particular action are rightly understood as part of the accurate understanding, not of the basic motion itself. Historians will understand this as one definition of pertinent context, the framework of the relevant on which historical description and interpretation stand. Let me give a germane example. After the battle, at around 11 p.m., as the Duke of Wellington was handing the horse over to his groom, Copenhagen kicked out and nearly struck the Duke. The movement, the kick itself—or per haps it was a sudden stretching of his leg! —is on this account seriously short on meaning.29 Historians have written of this incident frequently—a fact of some curiosity itself—but they have given it somewhat different characters: "We like to know that the great Duke, after getting down from his horse Copenhagen, which carried him through the whole battle of Waterloo, clapped him on the neck, when the war-charger kicked out, as if untired."30 "When the exhausted Welling ton finally dismounted, Copenhagen swung around and aimed a kick that almost killed the Duke. Next day came more mischief... ,"31 "On the memorable day of Waterloo though the great captain had been on his back for eighteen hours, yet Copenhagen gave little signs of his being beaten, for on the duke patting him on the quarter, as he dismounted after the battle, the game little horse struck out as playfully as if he had only had an hour's ride in the park."32 "Wellington returned to the village of Waterloo that night, and as he dismounted, after having been so many hours in the saddle, his trusty Copenhagen, still fresh, gave a playful kick, remembered by his master in after years."33 Connecting the act to the description recapitulates the relationship of event to emplotment, in Hay den White's terms, but either way the significance is not merely in the movement that was the kick.34 29. Here I have abstracted the kick from its context and its stories to sharpen the point, but most actions come inevitably as part of an understanding. Compare the description that Bruno Latour gives in Reassembling the Social, showing how the actant becomes an agent when brought under such a label or description, which he calls a figuration. As in my description, the challenge is not to write or think as if there are pure events before someone describes them.

These four, not especially scholarly, accounts, for instance, each place the horse's action into the service of their narrative, implying if only a little what the horse was about. It is worth noting, however, that none of these accounts actually say what Copenhagen meant by it. They place the kick into an account of his endurance, or of his high spirits, only one suggesting that he was something like angry. They shy from addressing the question: what is it like to be a horse in this case, even though we suspect the answer is not so strange as being a bat.35 There is perhaps an assumption of body and spirit rather more than mind at play. But we might imagine that a different historian might be bolder here. The work of Jason Hribal is very concerned with looking for animal agency as a form of subaltern resistance, so he might argue, as he did in the case of a cow that escaped from the abbatoir, that animals might be expressing themselves in such a context.36 A horse's kick could thus be a form of resistance. By providing instances from historians' texts, I don't mean to say that those have a priority in providing an account, but they do help to make clear that there might be a problem not only of context but also of sources. The horse acted in context but it's not any longer the context of the battle, that is, the story of a military achievement that was partially the fruit of the duke's rational agency and in which the horse operated only in the shadows, somewhat more like a secret agent. The horse's actions' correct context in the stable—from the horse's point of view—is very difficult to approach, but an account of such equine agency seems possible without trying to explain the nature of horsey consciousness. Medieval writers similarly avoided psychologi cal anthropomorphizing when they considered something as strange as the nature of angelic intellect, as Lorraine Daston has shown.37 Now equine "secret agency" might be explored without attempting to provide horse psychology, and this will be part of this article's task in its latter stages.38 Agencies will be unified by our accounts of them, more by the physical and narrative contexts than by under standing the actors' inner natures. To recap: we started from the rational egocentric subject who plans, imagines, describes, and reasons toward his or her goal, engaging his or her own body, including through speech or writing. We saw that the action was enriched and brought to its significance by its context and the descriptions and beliefs that went along with it and that could accurately be laid upon it. This raises the ques tion how much such full articulation and heavy rationality fit into the picture, 35. Thomas Nagel, "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"

Would it help to work out something like a theory of basic pre- or parallel "lan guage," bounded by action's limits and the dialogue of sensation?40 Perhaps this language could be represented as having a relationship to real human language like that held by Indo-European to known descendant languages. Basic cognate terms, supposed to exist, would be indicated by an *. *Want. *Avoid. I fancy that it would be the way things were just before the first certain words were spoken. It was a language of gestures and zones of action but it had its intentionality and its emotionality, that is, feeling was already insinuated into thinking. I'd love to call this *theeling, but that word is a little comic. This sort of *language could be frustrating and it made a beast want to talk, but it was not yet, mainly, speech itself. Some dogs, some parrots seem very much in this state, except for the frus tration, but the means to translate the one *language into the other language can never be perfect or even very good. Say, in this language there was the concept *color but no specific terms for individual colors. Another way to think of it would be that this proto-language answers the challenge: imagine a language with very few words and no tenses. I think that within such a "language" basic "propositional dispositions," such as beliefs and intentions, for instance, would exist. They find their place in those actions that we can call utterances, a subspecies, at first, of gesture. As it turns out, I believe that people a lot of the time and some animals some of the time do operate in such a zone of *language, and this represents in its socially alive way a sort of middle world for agency as well. The intuition is that language is actually a vast dynamic, ramifying array of very different sorts of action, some involving very limited reasoning or intentionality, others involving extraordinarily complex planning assumptions. But, again, I fear that this is what Plato was thinking as well when he yielded animation, animality to plants. Accepting, however, that there are beliefs and intentions even where there is no language is not a wholly unusual or outrageous view within philosophy or cognitive studies. The early analytic philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe thought that "Intention appears to be something that we can express but which brutes [ani mals] . .. can have."41 Norman Malcolm thought animals had beliefs, and Kristin A. Andrews, among others, is currently trying to overturn the pall that Davidson has thrown over the idea that animals lack such propositional dispositions and as a consequence cannot have thoughts or be actors.42 Further mainstream comfort 39.

But, as I've started to suggest, there are elements within the robust form of agency that are somewhat less daunting. In other words, a calcu lating man in a calculating age might have managed great feats of reasoning that went well beyond the basic requirements of a deliberative actor. After all, the Duke of Wellington was an actor when he decided to sit upon Copenhagen at 6 a.m. or so; that action, crucial as it was to everything else he did that day, was not so very clever nor complicated nor calculating. It's not just more facetiousness to ask how this differed from Copenhagen's decision to stand under the Duke at around 6 a.m. as well. He didn't kick then, and Copenhagen carried the Duke through the day, and what a day it was. Agency seems to be a continuity into which animals can be inserted, overlapping with human animals as actors. In these "two" actions—Arthur the duke getting on his horse and Copenhagen the horse standing still and compliant while a familiar man got astride—there is everything we need to think through animals and agency. My immediate point: the actions coincided in complexity insofar as they went, aside perhaps from the question of who initiated the action. Let me abstract a little more: were the Duke riding Copenhagen as he did ten years later, in 1822, over his large estate at Strat field Saye, the mounting, the riding out for exercise and pleasure, like a long bike ride on a fall Saturday, the willed and intended action of horse-and-rider would be very much alike. The human ability to give an account of the activity affects our experience, of course, but it is not necessary for our action or our pleasure in the action. Here human and animal agency are very much alike. In that moment, it was so. As we shall see, time and reflection will have their say, but in that moment of mounting and riding in calm Berkshire, man and horse were united and acted almost as one. The timing is important. People are, as it were, animals most of the time, and most of our doings are habituated, copied, even instinctual, the goal embedded in the practice so well that articulation and self-consciousness are not typically relevant. There is reason in the habit, in other words, as some phenomenology and sociology has shown. Taking the sharp edges off of deliberative reason in this way allows us to argue more confidently for the possibility that a horse or a dog could possess meaningful agency, even if it's difficult to interpret. They don't just move, automata as Descartes supposed, but they have goals and pursue them and do what they could otherwise decide not to do.44 43.

UNITIES: THE FLUID ASSEMBLY OF AGENTS Agency rests typically in an action not in a state;45 it's not an inevitable character of something but is built up from animation, from the ability to move, negotiate the social and physical environment, interact, and think. From what I've said so far, we can see that some degree of agency might reasonably be given in com mon to people and horses, even if sometimes the quality of their agency differs. Moreover, the relative significance of animal agency must be seen in conjunction with our expectations for human agency. The interaction between different agents can be important, and when we consider that action, not state, is key, then we can see that the coming together of beings raises many interesting questions for the character of agency. Some recent conceptions of agency do encourage us to stress the possible interaction, social fusion, and cohesion of a cavalryman and his horse (and other things too). At the pinnacle of social coordination is the unity, in which the man on a horse becomes the horse-and-rider. Recently, scholars from many different quarters have resisted the somewhat atomistic assumptions of the idealized rational agent that the military general under his "mask of command" might epitomize in history. Part of the appeal of military history for exploring agency is that it's easy to see that no one indi vidual can possibly have mattered much unless he or she were in the cockpit of an organized aggregation, whose actions were clearly different from the actions of any one man or horse. This insight can be approached from a variety of fairly radical ontological directions. Cary Wolfe in his What is Posthumanism? urges an approach that sees the human as "fundamentally a prosthetic creature that has coevolved with various forms of technicity and materiality, forms that are radically 'not-human' and yet have nevertheless made the human what it is."46 Wolfe not only wants us to see the need to deconstruct the assumed and steady categories but also to recognize the dynamic interaction of beings in patterns and systems. For Wolfe—and few others so far—the fluid structures of sociologist Niklas Luhmann speak in concert with Jacques Derrida to show how the nonhu man forces a transformation of human being. Related processes are central in Jane Bennett's Vibrant Matter. There, in the service of political ecology, Bennett takes up Spinoza and Bruno Latour (among others) to see a sort of agency existing in pretty much everything. The tracing of contiguous, related actions becomes crucial. The fact that any given thing is involved in a vast range of interactions with almost infinite intermediate effects becomes central to this vision, which is another way of resisting an excessive focus on human power. So in one chapter she stresses the agency of foods and drugs on humans and notes how the social sciences have tended to see food from the point of view of human actions rather than the way that microsparasites might 45.1 thank Laura Stark for eroding my hidden prejudice on this matter. 46.

Bennett argues that taking Spinoza seriously allows us to realize that bodies advance their power by entering into "heterogeneous assemblages." Taking the interconnected liveliness of all matter seriously will transform core ideas, ulti mately of ecology, but also for the concept of agency: "the efficacy or effectivity to which that term [agency] has traditionally referred becomes distributed across an ontologically heterogeneous field, rather than being a capacity localized in a human body or in a collective produced (only) by human efforts."50 The pres ence of Thoreau and Spinoza flags this as just one sort of turn away from the human toward a somewhat pantheistic posthumanity, where value is dispersed like power through all things but the whole is live and insistent, and worthy. Everything matters, and in fact it can be a bit difficult to know what piece of any situation is a key one. Indeed, one advantage of something like Luhmann's sys tems theory is that the self-sustaining quality of a system gives it boundaries that organize its imperatives as it intersects with its various environments, typically other systems.51 Bennett's vision is a freer one. I need to stress that in this approach, interdependence is crucial. The influ ence of Haraway and Deleuze and Guattari is decisive,52 but there is also much borrowed from the perspective of actor network theory (ANT), associated with Bruno Latour and John Law. There is something rather more sober in ANT's for mulation, which is somewhat less passionate about the world and its value, less, well, pantheistic, but equally or even more persistently focused on the minute and certain interactions and transformations that occur as one thing acts on another.53 Theoretically, ANT conceives of all "things" that have an effect as being actants. In Latour's view, for instance, actors are not more likely to be "people" than anything else. What's more, "an actor in the hyphenated expression actor network is not the source of an action but the moving target of a vast array of entities swarming towards it." "An actor is what is made to act by many others."54 47. Jane Bennett, Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2010), chapter 3, "Edible Matter." 48.

For Latour, these become agents once they are described within the context of a particular situation and framework. Once again, everything can be an agent, and although that threatens to become a crude tool, it does have the benefit of insisting on a rather firm, even stern desire that we try to avoid preconceptions about where the motive power is. In all of these theories, relatively new to historians and historical theory, there is an assumption that much has been rendered opaque or even occult because a traditional ontology—which certainly has flourished in history as much as any where—has played most of its game through humans alone. Clearly in all of these approaches animals are either as irrelevant as people, dissolved into systems small or large, or people are as little in control as animals. Agencies are things that make you or anything do something, but the "you" is not the center of the story. The overthrowing of the human, the arrival of the posthuman is certainly one of the conclusions from all these approaches.55 Nevertheless, there is a key distinction within Latour's version of ANT that is worth mentioning because it might explain something quite important about the more traditional ideas of agency with which I started this paper. For Latour, given any actor, the key issue in any interaction is whether the actor operates as an intermediary or a mediator. Intermediaries "[transport] meaning or force without transformation," whereas mediators are unreliable: "Their input is never a good predictor of their output."56 These two options sum up the relationship of any one thing to another in an instance of doing or happening. They also indicate a place where we could say that theories of individualistic agency have tended to make much of the mediating character of the person, forgetting perhaps how many other things are also mediators, including the mud beneath the cannon wheels and horses' hooves at Waterloo.57 Still, the extent of mediation available in certain sorts of transactions or through certain types of actors might be habitually wider or more typically mediating, suggesting they are more akin to traditional agents, unpredictable nodes of power. We can see again how a disciplined army becomes an agent prone to act more like an intermediary of commands, of straight communication, rather than a col lection of idiosyncratic heroes. Moreover, training people and animals together has the effect of rendering them in certain respects more like intermediaries than mediators. To some extent, this is what made me notice horses' and soldiers' similarity as historical players. The animal nature seemed large for the Inniskill ings regiment, who slept behind the lines for the first four hours of the battle, then were ordered to move to the front and held their ground for the next three or four hours at the crisis point, suffering titanic artillery barrage, heavy cavalry attack, 55. The challenge of the posthuman is undulating across the humanities.

Only 300 of the regiment's 750 men and officers came through unscathed, and with almost all officers rendered hors de combat early, they had little communication or understanding of what was going on elsewhere or overall, "central" as they were. They stood or lay together, having few occasions to return fire or to move but many to fear and to suffer. Just as notably, they never fled to save their lives.58 They participated in the greatest battle of the century; they were in a crucial position. How much did they know about its high purposes or whether what they were doing made a difference? How much did the horses know? How much did Copenhagen matter compared to a man lying on his stomach, praying? Regardless of the advice of holism or ANT fluidity, it appears clear that horse and-rider were a special relationship in the early nineteenth century, and within the army that suggests we see them as a special sort of being. I call this a unity, a temporary but socially significant fusion of sensible things. British officers were almost always gentlemen by social type, and cavalry horses were like the men who rode them, coddled, but eventually trained to the task; similarly, rank and file cavalrymen were also necessarily trained to blend with their horses. Something I like about ANT is its hunch that our language's tricks and metaphors, the ways we put things, actually are evidence for the actants operating within a network.59 When we say horse-and-rider moved as one, it is an intuition or suspicion of their unity. In his cavalry-horse training manual Military Equitation, popular during Wellington's and Copenhagen's lives, the Earl of Pembroke noted: "in proceed ing according to the manner I have here proposed, a man is rendered firm and easy upon the horse, and, as it were, of a piece with him, [and] both his own and the horse's sensibility is preserved. . . ."60 The calibration of rider and horse was a discipline that affected and transformed each, disposing them toward unity. The Earl again: "A hand should be firm but delicate: a horse's mouth should never be surprised by any sudden transition of it, either from slack to tight or tight to slack. Everything in horsemanship must be effected by degrees, and with delicacy, but at the same time with spirit and resolution."61 He goes on very interestingly about the horse's mouth and the man's gentleness, their dynamism. Moreover, their unity or its lack showed. During a ceremonial parade in Paris after Napoleon's defeat, Wellington saw an officer going by and snapped to an aide: "Go and tell that damn adjutant he can't ride. Tell him to get off his horse."62 A horse and a man could be clumsy together like the hapless adjutant, never achieving the easy, 58. See Mark R. Bois, "Men, Cohesion, and Battle: The Inniskilling Regiment at Waterloo," MA thesis, University of Louisville, 2006; and John Keegan, The Face of Battle (Harmondsworth, UK: Penguin, 1978), 128-130. 59.

A man and a horse can interact in many ways, but the horse-and-rider act as one. That some human beings were planning this construction of unities, the mak ing of new temporary sorts of beings, and contriving it, oughtn't to let us lose sight of the fact that others were little more knowing than the horses and were themselves being considerably molded and changed in the disciplinary training process. The making of the unity of men and horses as actors and symbols—so actors in the ANT sense—is seen too in the value given the horses. It is hard to avoid sentimentality perhaps, but historical detail helps: horses were in demand to sell and to acquire. With their riders, they were part of an admired package that was the mark of a different sort of being. Other sorts of horses, if not so clearly parts of unities, were still key elements of the army. Orders to manage the capture of horses and to guard against their theft are notable in Wellington's Dispatches, including his regulations for managing his armies.63 One cavalry officer, Captain William Tomkinson, had a horse called Bob, and his journal occasionally notes him by name. The naming of horses is itself a clue to their social connection. Horses had names and had masters. Bob was lucky as well. Food was often in short supply in the Peninsular War and the horses suffered from starvation and deprivation. "The expression was that the horses of the French army did not die by hundreds but by thousands,"64 Tomkinson wrote, proud of British support of their horses. The men spent much time foraging for the horses' food. In battle Tomkinson reckoned his company's horses pretty much as men: he marked casualties by ranks. A typical entry went: Rank: Maj. Capts. Lieuts. Staff Ensign. Sergts. Rank &amp; File Horses Killed 56 59 Wounded 273 65 Missing 27 21 A gentleman's sense of hierarchy nicely picks up the order of things, and from his historical view the loss of packhorses and mules was a noncompany or nonmartial matter. In the self-understanding of the collective agency of the military company, warhorses were a part of that agency, of that group. Did they exist in that fascinating space shared perhaps by "pets," on which so much work has been done in the period since Waterloo?65 As I've been arguing, for some soldiers, horses weren't merely secret agents but a man's superior war legs, not merely prosthetic but united. Some days Captain Tomkinson and his men were in the saddle for twenty hours. They slept with the horses near enough and free enough to be at risk when a thunderstorm frightened them. This sort of engagement, sometimes orderly, often drenched in adrenaline and fear, occurred thousands of times during the great battle. Men panicked, dismounted, and ran; horses panicked and ran out of control. Horses 63. Dispatches, xiii, 353,418; Dispatches, xiv, 240, 247,435. 64. Tomkinson, Diary of a Cavalry Officer, 229. 65.

Officers died, leaving their horses, to "return alone" to waiting family or friends.66 Unities come and go, in peace or war, panic or pleasure, but they are in their moment transformative if rare. Let me give a sense of Copenhagen's fit in this world. Wellington paid 400 guineas for him, a very sizable amount it its day. Related to today's earnings, it would be equivalent to something like £300,000, although that inflates the rela tive cost to a nobleman. Either way, he was known to be valuable, and we needn't remind ourselves that a price like that means that a lot of people would have liked to have him. His forebears were known and were quite distinguished, and this mattered in his world. He was descended from the great thoroughbred and stud Eclipse67 on his dam's side. Crucially, he had Arabian blood on his sire's side, the combination of which made him fast and possessed of a great endurance—or so the blood talk of the time argued. He raced with modest success, and the excite ment and noise of the crowds at Craven and Chester race grounds prepared him for the commotion, the mayhem of war. He won twice and placed in nine other races. Then he was sold to a soldier and in 1811 to the Duke of Wellington. Like their officers, the horses were given special treatment, first access to new stocks of food and better food; their performance was part of the officer's performance and his dignity too, social selves intertwined even when their bodies weren't. In this case, the horse as agent was tightly bound up with the rider. They were united by common training, by common experience, by habituation, all made much deeper by the constant physical contact and the sense that the quality of that contact and communication might make a difference to the ability of man and horse to work with saber and saddle and do the business. Surely, it mattered too whether charger and officer had good chemistry. A lady who rode Copenhagen not long after Waterloo remarked that "I found Copenhagen the most difficult horse to sit of any I had ever ridden. If the Duke had not been there I should have been frightened."68 And soldiers were said to have warned that "that horse kicks." He wasn't easy; this is unsurprising, since he was a stallion. One might speculate a little on the way that the suitability of horse to rider might even have the character of physical and emotional alignment. Emotional practices can vary through history but there is a good chance that they can exist as well in the sociability between animals and people; in fact, emotional chemistry might even be more important where language is less relevant.69 A stal lion fit for a very imperious field marshal who liked to observe and direct battles from the brow of danger is one picture of the unity or the localized agency called 66.

In fact, Copenhagen's story is more complicated, because there was a blot on his record and he shows up as a sort of footnote in The General Stud Book, vol. 2 (London: Charles Weatherby, 1832), 146.

Their saddle and his telescope were well suited to him too and we might say he to them. Wellington was an object that could conform to that saddle and see well through that tele scope. Perhaps they are part of the fabric of agency à la Latour, but we should see now that the sort of integrated agency that occurred between the duke and Copen hagen, between Tomkinson and Bob, between the thousands of cavalry men and their horses, operated as well at another level. Central to a unity's agency was the link of sensory, emotional, and visceral engagement that allowed for a special fusion for action. "When horses, as well as men, are new in war, I believe they are generally the sacrifice of their mutual inexperience."70 These unities could learn, could improve. The predictability of Copenhagen's responses was not because he was more of an automaton than another horse, but because the matching up, the training, the character, the experience, was more carefully and comfortably executed. This exemplifies the daily wonder that communicating or sympathetic beings let themselves become "objects" in order better to be agents, together.71 That one was a secret and subordinated agent doesn't quite destroy the point. Indeed, one of the puzzles of subordination is distinguishing it from coordination. When in later years the Duke would play a game of Waterloo with children and others at Stratfield Saye, the family and friends deployed for war, mounted and ready, waiting for the family cannons to thunder and smoke, Copenhagen, it is reported, would always move toward the smoke, toward the action rather than away. It might seem odd that so much of exercising your freedom should be show ing that you recall your training and your experience, but so it might be, for us all. When necessary, Wellington needed to be near the fire and smoke and needed a horse that was also comfortable under fire. Apparently Copenhagen was. But we needn't move to sentimentality: you can be keen on the role of animals and not make that move. On the other hand, it has its place where the world under examination saw heightened meaning and emotion in the animals as well. This was surely the case with the Victorians' views of Copenhagen; doing the history properly requires acknowledging that he had a place within their historical mem ory. The bones of the great racehorse Eclipse are possibly present in the Royal Veterinary College in Hertfordshire,72 Napoleon's Marengo's skeleton is nicely assembled on display at the National Army Museum in Chelsea, but Copenhagen was buried with a ceremony on the Duke of Wellington's estate, in the Duke's nresence. and there's a headstone set un and an oak tree olanted to mark the site. which is much visited.

THE LIMITS AND POSSIBILITIES OF ANIMAL AGENCY Historically relevant agency encompasses a continuum of actions, and the doers of those actions turn out to be historically variable sorts of things, not necessar ily or only people. Animals certainly can play a part, not as generals but maybe something a bit more like soldiers. They weren't generally highly rational or self-reflective agents, but although such agency does exist in some historical moments—enter Napoleon—it always coexists with other, less articulate sorts of agency that humans and animals might share. Animals could be parts of great, interconnected wholes —armies, for instance—and they might even be recognized by the people of the historical period as important parts of historical actions—like cavalry horses circa 1815. Alternatively, it might be historians who discover animals' contributions where the contemporary sources were quieter about the animal actors—dogs with Cortés—where animals' roles weren't part of the period's imaginative assumptions. These secret agents need to be found out too, the crucial overlooked animals. Humans and animals could be agents togeth er in ways quite comparable to some of the ways people become interconnected or group agents. Animals' place in the complex of actions can't be assumed, but still should be sought in each historical context. I have been arguing additionally that there could be socially structured, spe cial associations between people and animals that combined to make a different, temporarily fused sort of powerful thing, a unity, with qualities distinct from either of the components. The horse-and-rider at war is a clear, powerful unity, historically fascinating and important. Added to the suggestions of the first part of this article, we can argue that there is a considerable space for animals, such as horses at war in the nineteenth century, to be part of historical agents, and that their own animal reactions and intentions could affect the sort of war that could be prosecuted and the sort of outcomes that battles might have. People counted on them and their qualities. They were part of the structuring of battlefield agency in that specific historical context. Taking agents as potential combinations rather than inevitably autonomous helps to show the advantages of integrating the study of animals within a richer and wider historiographical framework. It helps to make sense of people's his torical agency to be sure. On the one hand, we stress animals' roles within net works of effects, while on the other, we probe the particular character of animals' engagement. In other words, we should try to make more of animals' historical "contribution" and their lived, historical "experience." Without question, how ever, a wider sense of agency mandates a different sort of history. From such a perspective, human historical agency will seem more dispersed, more often linked to animals and things. We will understand agency as working through networks of actors, some until now secret, and through occasional, special uni ties. No need to abandon the idea of agents or agency, but we need to understand agency's complexity and promiscuity.</page><page sequence="21">166 DAVID GARY SHAW A second part of the question is learning how humans have understood animals within their explicitly historiographical and causal assumptions. Recognizing the possible shading of one agent into another, of one concept into another, of one cause into another provides additional bridges for understanding the rather more dynamic world of animate beings that operated in the cultures of the past. Although much has been done, and again, by contributors to this issue, there can be little doubt that historians will renew study of the diversity of human notions about animals and how they worked or warred with people. Intriguingly, many of the issues that emerge in considering animal agency arrive as well in consider ing cyborgs and artificial intelligences in the contemporary age, but also God's angels, Satan's demons, free-willed woodland goddesses, disease-dealing elves, and other mysterious or occult powers attested throughout history, not to mention those objects of miraculous intervention in medieval miracle stories, bones chan neling their long-dead saintly owner from heaven, for instance.74 It is not clear how far we are decentering the human by including the animal. There are still rather special qualities that humans have and limits to how animals can act. For instance, there is the recursive nature of a human's historical knowl edge and action. The person sees something of itself through time. What's more, the way that time becomes self-consciously part of our living, partly through our linguistic possibilities, the way that symbolizing extends mind through time, affects us greatly, changing action by changing reflection. And what of the future? "The day after tomorrow" is such a simple phrase but the concept would appear very difficult to imagine translating out of language into the base *lan guage I fantasized about earlier, the *language a horse might understand. This is another way of saying that historically conscious agency looks to be occupied by human beings for whom certain sorts of complex planning are possible. We intervene in order to try to influence those bodies, our minds, our emotions, as well as the swarm of things that actor network theory posits as coming toward us. Time frees us from the present but condemns us to history. I don't know what it's like to be a horse, however convincing Black Beauty or Strider and companion horses might seem.75 But the historical relevance of Copenhagen's action and bravery at Waterloo—more even than his anomalous kick—is a function of the imposition of some historical context of meaning that he couldn't know, a story, a reason, a plan, a chronology beyond him. "Consider the cattle, grazing as they pass you by. They do not know what is meant by yes terday or today, they leap about, eat, rest, digest, leap about again, and so from morn till night and from day to day, fettered to the moment and its pleasure or displeasure, and thus neither melancholy nor bored. . . ,"76 My suspicion is: our rudimentary *language is too coarse for historical time although fully fitted for action. Indeed, humans also know this * language's sense of time, consisting of a 74.

For this short temporal angle we coined a misleading term: the present. So, Copenhagen acting at Waterloo in unity with the Duke had historical sig nificance and contributed more than many a biped to the outcome of Napoleon's big day. I think it can be said, if debated, that Copenhagen did what he had to do with gusto, taking and giving communication from the Duke —spurs, words, neighs, muscle-flexing—and doing things that everything we know about horses tells us must have been frightening to a less seasoned horse. He intended to gal lop when urged by the Duke to evade charging French horses, maybe intending it even without urging, and intended to go there, where there was the safe center of a British infantry square. He acted and was significant because of Wellington's story, but also because of their unity. But he didn't intend to thwart Napoleon or keep in the field in good order until "nightfall or the Prussians" arrived or to save the fleas on his back. The ability to shape context through narrative and imagination is not necessar ily what you need to be happy, but it might be what you need to think historically. "The day after tomorrow." You can play a role as a historical agent otherwise, but you can't do so knowingly, and only knowingly can you shape the sort of fatal, furious fact of bringing 200,000 men and horses together to act and contest the way to Brussels even to their deaths. We don't need to make too much of the difference agents can make to see that they can make some difference, and sometimes even intend the actions and ends they contribute to, and sometimes be responsible for them. Agency makes things go on at least a little differently, and increasingly we'll see that, given one theory of agency or another, animals deserve a place in that necessarily human story.
