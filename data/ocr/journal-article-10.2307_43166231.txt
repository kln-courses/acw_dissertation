<plain_text><page sequence="1">Footprints in the Swamp. Marie Halun Blough. 111. by Robert Shetterly. 70pp. $12.95. Scribner, Front and Brown Sts., Riverside, NJ 08075. 1985. (Intermediate elementary and middle school) It is not orten that those who are asked to review science-related texts are given the opportunity to deal with feelings. Perhaps it is the idea that science is only hard, cold facts that makes the anthropomorphic approach seem less than scientific. Whatever makes it rare, the effect of the technique in this book on this reader was very positive. This is a straightforward yet imaginative story dealing with the plants and animals that cause the "footprints in the swamp." The description of prehistoric animals and their environment is accurate. Relative sizes of animals and their physical descriptions come through clearly, and their names seem as natural as "Jayne" or "Bob." The central character is one that students will know, the opossum. The real strength of this book is that it provides many oportunities for discussion. The cycle of life and death, the effect of changes in food sources, carnivores in action, volcanoes, and many other topics essential to an understanding of prehistoric life are introduced without overwhelming the reader with facts. The text is sensitively written and attractively illustrated. John 5. Heck</page></plain_text>
