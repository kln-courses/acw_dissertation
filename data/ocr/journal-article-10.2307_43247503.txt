<plain_text><page sequence="1">Turner on 'Operative Rituals': A Sociological Response Kieran Flanagan In a rather bleak essay, Charles Davis observed in 1970 that 'the general verdict upon liturgical reform is that it has failed to solve the problem of worship in a secular age' and 'that the chief effect of the reforms has been to uncover an insoluble problem'.1 Any sociological response to liturgical renewal came after the late six- ties as a critical reaction to changes implemented as a result of Vatican II. There was certainly no sociological participation in the demands for liturgical change prior to 1963. As a result the Con- ciliar reforms did not so much answer a sociological scepticism as generate one that has developed increasingly since. The attempt to relate the shape of rite, to what were perceived as the cultural and social needs of a secular modern society, merged with a wish to maximise the active participation of the laity in the liturgy, whose simplicity and clarity of form, would enable a worshipping com- munity to develop as a witness to an increasingly sceptical society . Pre-Conciliar forms of rite were rigid in shape, objectively sec- ured in complex rubrics, but were considered as implausible and irrelevant to contemporary needs. The tenor of the new rites was a 425</page><page sequence="2">mixture of looser simplified rubrics, in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 1969, matched to a sensitivity to pastoral and cultural needs. But this wish for some degree of adaptability (that satisfied neither radicals nor conservatives) pre-supposed some cri- teria of assessing changes in form as affecting local situations. If indigenization was to occur some form of systematic evaluation seemed desirable. Initially, the changes were met with indifference by sociologists of religion, who have displayed little interest in the social nature of liturgy since. This partly accounts for the paucity of systematic research studies on the effects of the liturgical chan- ges and the degree to which they have fulfilled their goals. Open- ing rite out, giving pluralism a theological status and assuming that complex symbols and rituals were impediments to the faithful, pointed to a sociological response. Liturgy as a mode of realizing the gift of faith requires some means of making it realisable and knowable in terms that can be considered socially plausible and authentic. Rite, at whatever theo- logical level it is cast, has to have a social and cultural mode of del- ivery. The crucial question is how this is to be sociologically assess- ed in a way that does not effect a mistranslation of the basis of the liturgy? A cultural dimension has been written into contemporary theological specifications for ritual efficacy. Success or failure is now tied to subjective performative criteria for evaluating practice. This raises the issue of how competing forms of rite are to be assess- ed? Seasoltz has suggested that pluralism, the unfinished business of liturgical reform, is seen as inherently heterodox by some Bishops. This suggests a conservative nostalgia clouding their theological judgment.2 But sociologists such as Berger regard pluralism as a theological issue that undermines the plausibility structures of contemporary rite, and renders the pursuit of the transcendent all the more hazardous. Indeed, pluralism simply begs a question of the arbitration of the social basis of competing rites that also admits a sociological expectation of its resolution. This discipline cannot completely supply this, however, without dangers of mistranslation, as debates on relativism, rationality and context-free pre-suppositions, all indicate. Yet if liturgy is to be related to social and cultural needs there has to be some expectation of sociological involvement in liturgi- cal theology.3 Clearly there is a problem of marrying the differing methodological assumptions to the same issue of rite in the mod- ern world. But at the moment relationships between theology and sociology over liturgy are divided if not in a state of cold warfare. Those sociologists and anthropologists who have written on rites</page><page sequence="3">of the Anglican and Catholic Churches, such as Peter Berger, Mary Douglas, Victor Turner and David Martin, have been uniformly critical of the social pre-suppositions of liturgical renewal since the Council. Most writing on liturgy by sociologists has displayed varying degress of sympathy for orthodox, conservative positions: This has surprised and annoyed some theologians who had expect- ed progressive and socially relevant stances to win sociological approval. It could be argued that a sociological defence of formal, invar- iant complex rituals, set in the ceremonial enactment of rich sym- bols and ornate rituals, simply reflects the spiritual and aesthetic preferences of particular sociologists, who idi pick out different issues to criticise. It also could be said that the battle over the Alter- native Service Book, that resulted in the Prayer Book Protection Bill, moved by Viscount Cranbourne in 1981 was a right-wing pol- itical means of controlling leftward tendencies of progressive Ang- lican clergy. Yet somehow these qualifications do not affect the main thrust of sociological critiques of current forms and practices of liturgy. Whilst they do parallel conservative objections, and im- plicitly endorse many of their stances, their frames of reference come from wider debates in anthropology on ritual, symbol, and their operative qualities in areas ranging from healing rites to the, implications of ordinary language philosophy on social reasoning. This has reflected a fundamental shift in sociological attitudes to liturgical elements hitherto considered indefensible, and irrelevant. Urban Holmes, a radical Anglican liturgist was one of the first to realise in 1973 that liturgical renewal came to fruition in the churches ten years too soon, and that there had been a lamentable '"near miss" between a liturgical breakthrough and a turning point in the anthropology or religion'.4 Operative qualities of symbols, the experience they opened out, the imagination they excited, and the transcendent they sometimes touched became central matters of interest in philosophy of social science. Increasingly, sociology is concerned with what ritual effects in its own terms, and not with how it is to be understood according to some vaguely defined pre-suppositions of secular reasoning. Oddly, sociologists have endorsed the autonomous, distinctive, and non-reducible basis of rite precisely at a time when some theologians seemed to wish to dissolve such elements in the interests of some supposed philosophically based criterion of relevance to modern man. But above all, the sacred has emerged as a central consideration of sociological concerns, shorn of the pejorative overtones the con- cept previously has elicited in the discipline. Some indication of the shift was Victor Turner's unexpected 427</page><page sequence="4">anthropological endorsement of the Tridentine rite. In his essay 'Ritual, Tribal and Catholic' Turner compared the basis of Triden- tine rites with the rituals of the Ndembu tribe by making use of Adrian Fortescue's The Ceremonies of the Roman Rite Described to show how they managed their differing criteria of complex enactment. Certainly understanding the two forms of rite showed no anthropological difficulty to Turner who found much to ad- mire in both. Indeed, Turner stated in the essay that the 'notion that "the ordinary faithful" can only appreciate the "sacred" when it is packaged in "secular" wrappings . . . goes clean counter to all anthropological experience'.5 Some evidence is emerging to suggest that despite their stress on democratic participation and communality, the newer liturgical rites are estranging the working classes, and that many of the new- er experiential groups are often self-indulgent lower middle class assemblies.6 The argument that simple rites and the pursuit of a rational intelligibility have disabled the pursuit of imaginative reli- gious experience is well put by Luis Maldonado. He argues that the reforms were carried out on the basis of a cultural criterion that is now outdated. Indeed the criteria of the early sixties is now doubly outdated by the counter-cultural movement of the early seventies and the new era of conservativism of the early eighties. His criti- cisms of the new rites, come from within anthropology, a discipline he feels, 'least suspect of being conservative, (which shows) how ridiculous are the postures of a certain clerical "progressivism" bent either on axing symbols or on creating new ones'.7 The cru- cial factor to Maldonado is the failure of the reforms to give ritual its central place in liturgical practice. Finally, it should be noted that whatever the theological lack of interest in sociological reflec- tions on liturgy, the subject is of increasing domestic importance to the discipline for the many issues it raises of form and content, symbol and action, and the meaning and interpretation of ritual without mistranslation. The issue of liturgy also has profound implications for the growing debate on the place of hermeneutics within sociological theory. Unfortunately, it cannot be said that theologians have taken much notice of this shift in interest within sociological approaches to liturgy. Those who have, have either been highly defensive, or have missed the point of the sociological implications for understanding of rite. For this reason Denys Turner's response to sociological interest in liturgy is much to be welcomed, even if objections can be raised to many of his conclu- sions.8 Turner sets the operative factors of rite within a Thomist under- standing of the Eucharist, that allows him to mark out the efficacy 428</page><page sequence="5">of the social with clear objective qualifications about what is signi- fied in the liturgy. He is correct to emphasise the divine autonomy of sacramental grace that allows him to criticise misguided assump- tions that somehow rite 'manufactures' a Holy gift. This has been the central fallacy of the liturgical renewal movement. Sacramen- tal efficacy is fused to its instrumental form of delivery but this raises a peculiar problematic for sociology. Yet because he sees elements of contradiction in the operative effects of rituals, and what they signify, he feels there is a role for the sociologist to comment. His separation of the conditions governing the social efficacy of rite from those governing its canonical validity are acceptable to a limited degree, as we shall argue later. But our concern is purely with the social parameters of the sacramental instrument and its implications for the credible basis of ritual performance. Many of his theological qualifications to sociological interventions are valuable, and indeed uncontentious. Sociologists do admit profound limitations to their discipline in discussing theological issues of suffering, grace, redemption and forgiveness. Most would accept that in handling liturgical issues, they are looking at social forms of rite that domesticate and realise these sacerdotal functions in a manner that is repetitious, yet is in- completely understandable in sociological terms. Indeed, the pre- suppositions of a theological nature specified by Turner could be fitted to the sociological task of understanding any cosmic belief system and its social mode of delivery. Finally, he is to be com- mended for his criticism of bidding prayers that set up foolish expectations and genuflections to the issue of unemployment. Less acceptable is his discussion of 'bastard rituals', and the sociological task of somehow legitimating their mode of delivery. Fundamentally, we do not link the ritual to the resolution of ideo- logical deceits; to the material conditions of its delivery ; nor to the ruptures that routinely parodies the sacramental character of what the rite is supposed to exhibit. For us, rite proclaims the numinous and the transcendent. The application of a criterion of ideology (in Turner's terms) to ritual efficacy is misleading and misplaced. We differ also with Turner over the sociological understanding of performative contradictions (which are similar to Goffman's notion of ceremonial profanations) and the problems of ambiguity these pose for rituals. Turner sees these as routinely effecting ruptures with a social reality, where moral demands become disguised in misguided self-deceiving genuflections of concern in liturgy - a form of ritual opiate. This ambiguous misplaced attempt at rele- vance to social issues causes him to see such rites as bastard rituals, whose contradictory nature precludes them from being modes of 429</page><page sequence="6">sacramental delivery. Even God cannot overcome their illegitimate nature. Turner can defend a theological position on the autonomy of Divine Grace, and at the same time castigate certain forms of rite as illegitimate. Because he denies an occasionalism in the deliv- ery of sacramental grace, he is therefore committed to the prob- lem of illegitimate instrumental modes of delivery as suggested by Aquinas. The fusion of grace to the social causes problems. The outcome of Turner's argument is to suggest that ideologi- cal contradictions misguidedly imported in ritual effect a routine disguise of the moral implications of what is condemned in the lit- urgy. But Turner's approach generates endless ideological prob- lems of arbitration between claims that forms are ruptures. By ad- mitting such a criterion to ritual efficacy, theoretically no form of rite could over-ride hostile critical claims of routinely disguising social reality. Turner's criterion of ritual would make them all ulti- mately bastardised in terms of the religious and sacerdotal values they try to wrest from the secular and the literal. By relating ritual to the ideological, Turner begs questions about the sociological nature of both. Depending on his definition, each has a different criterion of rupture. Since these are seen as breakages with a social reality, that is ideologically constituted, the issue arises of what criteria will be privileged, and which pre-supposition of wholeness is to be adhered to, either in terms of what has been cast asunder or which has been redeemed by the resolution of a performative contradiction through social criticism. How can Turner set up a sociological language to arbitrate between different ideological claims, when the outcome of liturgy is by definition ambiguous (in social terms) and the forms are so potentially unstable in terms of taste, aesthetic inclinations, and doctrinal beliefs? Feminism can claim affront by the exclusion of women from serving, or of the realities sexist language routinely disguises; specism can claim continued references to the slaughter of lambs and redemption pose ambiguities the liturgy routinely smooths over; the ecology movement can likewise focus on an over-emphasis on wine as against the more ideologically satisfying use of water. All can write claims to affront into liturgical forms and assert demands for change according to some privileged view of reality they claim has been disguised in bastard rites. All can claim the sacramental instru- ments are false and illegitimate. Turner is posing sociology a question it cannot answer, because it does not see the issue of ritual efficacy and performative contra- dictions in those terms. If a bastard rite is an instrumental failure that constrains God, why then is the sociologist so lucky as to be able to redeem and make whole in ritual that which He cannot? 430</page><page sequence="7">Furthermore Turner never looks at the issue of varying levels of ambiguity and offence against differing elements of the ritual. Even if a sociologist accepted his point about ruptures, the level of the violation would have to be examined in some way. Another difficulty arises over what Turner means by ideologi- cal. This relates to an issue of what is intentionally disguised, what is mystified, such as in the issue of false consciousness, or such that, by definition, cannot be understood. We would suggest that the latter applies, and assert that the unutterable is what liturgy routinely handles and effects intermittent contact with. If by ide- ology, Turner is referring to some liberating function, this would become an eschatological issue that would preclude sociological participation. Ideology is seldom tied to the issue of ritual by soci- ologists, except in a crude sense as effecting an opium of the masses. We would admit the term 'ideological' to liturgy in Ricoeur's usage when he speaks of it as a mode of reflecting distance that separates social memory from an inaugural event to be (imperfectly) repeat- ed.9 Any ideological claim can be written into ritual form as a moral expectation that liturgy should endorse. One is safe in the knowledge that because the efficacy of rite is ultimately internal, the petition can never be found wanting. The trouble with Denys Turner's use of the occasionalism of grace and the interchangeable nature of the sacramental instrument is that it makes social forms random and their efficacy subject to ideological choice (informed by sociological reasoning). If we do not accept his definition of ideological, we could freely add in our own to argue that contem- porary society suffers a rupture from medieval values that might offer redemptive possibilities, and suggest that as a minimal con- cession the Sarum rite be at least restored. All social forms of liturgy cannot be equally efficacious, even at a sociological level. They vary in degrees of efficiency in realis- ing and making credible a belief system, hence the variety of opin- ion, conservative and radical on the social nature of liturgy. To a sociologist, the fundamental issue is not the management of some pre-emptive criterion of performative contradiction tied to some ill-defined notion of ideology. Rather his concern is with the means by which ambiguities are to be routinely coped with in a form that renders the operative qualities of liturgical action present. It is these qualities of content that give to rite its non-reducible defining characteristics that also render the form capable of being believed to be credible by the actors. It is because the basis of liturgy is incredible in social terms, that some form of rupture is necessary with the cultural reality within which it is enacted. Whereas Turner criticises an occasionalism of grace, we would 431</page><page sequence="8">want to widen it in terms of some characterising experience, unut- terable, and numinous that marks rite apart and also renders it a risky venture that might not 'work'. Liturgy does not have to import ideological genuflections into rite to encounter ambiguities and to face charges of ruptures with reality. Ambiguities and ruptures arise from within the ritual process by the nature of what it confronts. Rite in itself does not guarantee the social effects of what it signifies, a point of Turner's we accept. There is a theo- logical defence of this position (Turner's reference to instrumen- talism) that also is enforced from a sociological understanding of rite. In our argument the social is incomplete and is filled in liturgy by some unspecifiable sense of contact with signals of transcend- ence. The spiritual, it can be asserted, inhabits what is inchoate in the social. There is no guarantee that liturgical form will elicit a responding message, usually a nuministic quality in silence or in the darkness. Liturgies are ambiguous by the content they effect, and this sense of mystery fulfills the basis of the form. The sense of the mysterious can be manipulated, but in so doing there is always the risk of an empty silence or ceremonial, which makes the form a literal proclamation of human agency. Because of the nature of this content, whose relationship with form is ambiguous, a particular type of tact characterises liturgical management where- by mistakes (violations of working assumptions of the process of the rite) cause dangers of parody to intrude, and the literal basis of the transaction to be resurrected. Performative contradictions occur in liturgical enactment when social and ideological elements are not filtered out.10 Certainly, mystification can generate ideo- logical blindness and deceptions, as Turner indicates. But in ritual form mystifications are Janus faced. They effect a marking out of the non-reducible properties of liturgy, and that which can be socially objectified as a basis of response. Mystifications are ele- ments that give liturgy the basis of repetition. They generate curi- osity. But they also are a means of marking off the profane, and constituting the sacred. This is done by way of ritual petition, but not in some manner that constrains the basis of Divine intervention. Mystifications make ritual credible. Their ambiguous nature sits with the symbols and the actions that wait to be acted on, by a surplus of meaning, elements added that are unutterable, auton- omous and incredible. Because mystifications in ritual are ambiguous (they can fal- sify the social basis of the form, or can enable its sacred qualities to be marked), it is difficult to see how Turner can tie these to issues of sacramental efficacy. The sociological basis to assessing 432</page><page sequence="9">the instrumental form of the sacrament is missing, hence why the discipline is so unwilling to become involved in resolving instru- mental issues of grace in ritual. There is no sociological language for the issue or otherwise of grace. Because it cannot describe in minimum or maximum form the theological relationship of in- stitution to shape of rite, and its validity or efficacy, it avoids sac- ramental issues, but looks at the mode of handling experiences of the divine, as expressed in the connection between management of the ritual and the sense of the numinous it habitually attempts to realise. Unfortunately, the operative in liturgy cannot be con- fined to its relationship to ideological factors, for if this were the case sociological means of resolution would be straightforward. These ambiguities with content form the basis of the hazarding movement of the actors through the form of rite, and it is this pre- supposition any sociology of liturgy must start with if it is to avoid mistranslation or pre-emptive definitions of what the process ought to be about. Some distinctive non-reductionist basis has to be marked out for liturgy to be understood in its own terms. Some social form has to be available to sociological modes of understanding. Many transactions in contemporary society can be deemed as ritualistic and can also be linked to the ideological. The social in liturgy, however, is not a complete explanation of its transactions, for a truth is affirmed that transcends the form of rite to give it a felt content, a distinctive "grip". Sociologists emphasise the transcen- dent in rite, the nuministic in Otto's terms, as its incomplete dim- ension, for otherwise Durkheim's view of ritual as reducible to collective effervescence would prevail. To a sociologist, liturgy is a means of handling the intangible. Symbols, actions, and the social forms used are polyvalent in meaning and problematic in social effect, intended and unintended. They are supposed to represent efficiently a non-empirical reality. Symbols, as Ricoeur suggests are all expressions of double mean- ings, wherein a primary meaning refers to a second level never given directly. Furthermore, symbols carry for Ricoeur a meaning surplus whose adjudication is problematic in social terms.11 Be- cause symbols can be detaçhed from their referents their potential for enhancing performative contradictions are great. As Rappaport graphically put it: 'Lies are the bastard off-spring of symbols'.12 Equally actions can embody the "wrong elements": concern with detail can point to an obsessional neurosis, or it might display a necessary care over details for the efficient regulation of great complex ceremonial services. Performative contradictions, and im- purities might be discoveries for theologians. For sociologists, they 433</page><page sequence="10">are expected outcomes of liturgy, and the issue for them is how these contradictions are handled routinely in a manner compatible with the aims of the rite. Every liturgy carries a risk of parody by the proximity of the forms used to competing secular models deemed to be profane. A high mass tries to avoid charges of being an aesthetic treat for the cognoscenti. Radical liturgies generate worries about charges of self-indulgent conviviality and the pliability of the shape of the assembly for the enlightened. Routinising contradictions can reflect ideological dangers where the mode invalidates the message. But equally forms can be self-defeating as ritual if they do not con- front and routinise their contradictions of delivery within the enactment of the rite. A sociological approach to rite reflects therefore the management of an endemic ambiguity in liturgy, and the polyvalent nature of the actions and symbols that proclaim another reality to the social. For that reason, elements such as in- variance, objectification and hierarchy fulfill specific defensive functions in rite that might contradict wider ideological values. Social responses to the operative centre on its role in making present the visible means by which the institution of the Eucharist is believed to have been effected. It is not about imposing neces- sary and sufficient social criteria over God's redemptive gift. Rather it is about the conditions of social actualisation that forms a basis of response amongst the actors in a liturgy. Worship is a two way process. But -the problem of coming to terms with its mysterious nature is our problem not God's. Rituals have to repeat, to fulfil the edict of Eucharistie remembrance. As public formal instru- ments they attempt to purify themselves of unacceptable aspects of the social, profane, or inconsistent. Any intended regulation of social response is to what is assumed to be objectified in the sense of its being given, a fixed pre-supposition, such as Aquinas stipu- lates. But if rite is matching what is visibly known to what is be- lieved but invisible, the experience it produces of a mysterious content must be matched to forms equally characterisable. Fusing form to content in an operative manner has wide acceptance in sociology. Thus, reflecting Casei, Ladrière suggests the most funda- mental aspect of liturgical language is 'presentification' of an effi- cacious reality, that has its own operativity.13 There is a neces- sary dimension of mystery in liturgical form, not so much mysteri- ous and exclusive, as felt and inclusive. Liturgy contradicts everyday life, not accidentally, but by its nature in postulating and effecting- the accomplishment of a grace fused to a social form in an operative manner of interconnection. We generate our response and realise the basis of our belief by the 434</page><page sequence="11">credibility of that which partly, socially, has been presented to us. Action and intention merge in an operative fashion over what is be- lieved to have been accomplished. Sociology starts with that assumption, the belief that those participating in liturgy believe they have been acted on. Somehow, it has to take account of the dialectical nature of liturgical action and its indeterminate basis of response. Sociology's task is to demonstrate how this mode of res- ponse is to be characterised as an accomplished social construc- tion. Turner correctly feels that perlocutionary aspects of liturgy fall into a sociological domain. This approach has been already taken up by Rappaport and Skorupski who partly endorse theo- logical forms of argument in a secular context. What they are con- cerned with however is the prevention of incredible ruptures or disbeliefs through the effects of formalised routinisation. Ruptures can be about liturgical fictions but they are also about endemic factors of rite that form has to distance the participants from. An ideal of self emerges intentionally despite the ambiguous social forces of rite because of what it changes when operative approaches to ritual are accounted for. Skorupski has indicated that operative efficacy is not causal efficacy, but is a function of the authority of agent producing that which is said to have been produced.14 The question of the operative in ritual points to a mechanism of self- realisation, the changing from something in the social to some- thing else, in this context, the sacred. This then supposes that there is a routinised rupture with the social to effect and proclaim a new felt condition, where the intervening but indeterminate vari- able is the action of grace. The numinous can be a felt sense of realisation of that grace. Something more than the routinised abolition of ruptures by ideological fiat is required. The liturgical renewal movement has made a fatal assumption (which Denys Tur- ner implicitly criticises): that socially ineffective liturgies are assumed to be spiritually counter-productive. The quest for liturgi- cal renewal has been bedevilled by misplaced sociological expecta- tions. Actions in rite are objectified in terms that are a function of the need to indicate assent and to generate a social response. Rite is rendered dependent on theological efficacy, and the social is a condition of it being known. By deferring to grace and belief, and by emphasising the non-reductive experiential dimensions of rite, a sociologist can avoid charges of an anthropomorphic explana- tion. Thus, Stanner has noted ritual acts are really 'incomplete transactions with the supernatural'16 It is when they are rendered complete in form they become meaningless, both to sociology, 436</page><page sequence="12">and ultimately to their worshippers. To close forms of rite to the empirical is a fundamental and necessary contradiction that keeps it open to the sacred. Adherence to an operative approach to lit- urgy not only allows an agnosticism over grace to co-exist with a social explanation, but also underlines the degree to which form and content are fused in ritual acts of expression. There might well be excessive references in sociology to formal invariant public qual- ities of ritual. These could be the basis of a discipline that seeks to find consistency in an ambiguous act that renders the real unreal. Invariance is a dimension that makes ambiguity credible. Ambigu- ity reflects a divided human nature journeying in curiosity. Some liturgical ruptures are inherently ambiguous and are not capable of complete sociological resolution nor should they be. Ritual functions to manifest a cosmic order the proclamation of which leads to solidarity and community as an effect of what is done. As the repetitious realisation of an archaic charter event, liturgy has by its nature a traditional texture that exercises a con- straint on the degree to which forms of rite are pliable. An oper- ative approach looks at the domestication of the sacred in the here and now. Content and form are fused in a sacerdotal manner and credibility is sustained by the givenness of the rite. Both Rappaport and Tambiah see ritual factors sustaining contradictions in a mean- ingful manner. Thus, surplus or redundant actions function dialec- tically in ritual elaboration. But as Tambiah indicates this excess functions with a condensation and fusion characterising ritual action.17 His study of Buddhist rituals shows ritual repetitions yielding a cumulative effect through opposition and contrast in one superimposition of successive sequences.18 Useless effects contradict a sense of utility of the particular, which if disregarded allows the emergence of a holistic property of rite. The emergent pattern of the tribal and the 'thick' produces a grip, a sinking into the totality of effect. Ritual is the masking of reality in a theologi- cal expectation. Repetition demands a routinised mode, not to effect an ideological reproduction such as Bourdieu envisaged, that curtails freedom of choice, but rather in a ritual form to realise its expression. Routinisation gets ritual off a secular ground, by enab- ling private intentions to be confirmed in public discourse. Sociolo- gists have access to modes of prayer, posture, intonation, but can say nothing about their purity or quality over and above what people reflect on as having been collectively accomplished. The absence of an empirical effect on rite is not a sociological problem. Indeed, studies of ritual often emphasise their indeterminacy as a neces- sary dimension of communication.1 9 If at a methodological level, ritual has an indeterminate incom- 436</page><page sequence="13">plete dimension in sociological terms, it is possible to suggest that the meaning of the rite can only be completed by accepting an apophatic element in its form. An apophatic aura to rite at least places it in an operative frame acceptable both to a sociologist (admitting the uncertainty of outcome of rites in general) and to a theologian, who would wish to write in the sacred and mysterious basis of the Eucharist. Casel's approach to the Eucharist comple- ments such a sociological approach by fusing mystery into the operative dimension of the form of rite. Turner tends to confuse objective factors of rite as theologically given with those that have to be objectified as a basis of ritual movement. Unfortunately, Casel's interest in fusing form and content to mystery pre-dates Austin, and ordinary language philosophies in general. His attempt to give an autonomy to mystery and Euchar- istie presence, against rational expectations, would elicit a warm contemporary sociological response. For him, acts are operative, not only as tangible manifestations of a grace, but also as a means of realisation of the pledge of the gift. Sacerdotal actions make pres- ent that which is completed in theological intention by a con- gregational response of acceptance and growth. Thus as Casel ob- serves 'when we pray holy words, the saving reality of which they tell becomes a presence amongst us'.20 What is problematic about ruptures and ambiguities in rite is to argue at a sociological level why they breach theologically necessary conditions of enactment. It is important to remember that performative utterances in rituals, as Finnegan indicates, describe a process through which certain obligations are accepted and responded to in terms that realise the beliefs they proclaim.21 It is what the actor is enabled to effect that allows the sociologist to describe what is believed to have been effected. To suggest that ideologies incorporated into liturgical routines, as Turner argues, generate ruptures with social reality to the degree that effective means of response to social crises are disguised, overlooks the issue of theological hazards routinely incorporated into forms of belief. Hamnett has recently argued that Christian rites run acute risks in the management of doctrinal contradictions imposed by the twin dangers of Pelagian- ism (for Catholicism) and Docetism (for Calvinists) which can re- flect either presumption according to action or inaction in ritual.2 2 These pose risks of expressing undesirable qualities in ritual enact- ment, and a presumptuous form of instrumentalism that renders the liturgical act theologically illegitimate. Actors coping with liturgy often have to deal with ambiguities posed by the mode of expression or conveyance of grace. Whilst accepting the gift of the latter, they might find the means of the 437</page><page sequence="14">former unacceptable or offensive. Ruptures can occur in ritual when the referrent is substituted to effect a symbol that started off from another visible base. Thus a number of men and women find female extraordinary ministers of communion disturbing, for they re-present the operationalisation of a means of delivering a gift whose institution proceeds from a sacerdotal male, whose nexus of symbolism is entirely different. It is true that the ambiguity can be instantly resolved by rendering both open to both sexes, but this would simply transfer the ambiguity to wider hermeneutic, doctrinal and historical issues. If Turner argues that the occasion- alism of God's grace makes forms of rite random, and that even He cannot over-ride bastard rites, men can hardly overcome imperfect rituals that pose ambiguous impediments fused intractably to the delivery of Eucharistie gifts. Some elements of ritual are polyvalent and indeterminate by definition, in that the actor's intentions indicate the means by which the ambiguity is to be resolved. A white surplice denotes purity of intention, the regulation of personal choice, but equally it can be seen as a badge of vanity, and the proclamation of impious deceits. Because the issue of liturgical ambiguity is ambiguous, sociological interventions have to proceed carefully. Sociology can proceed on the basis that the beliefs, over whose pre-suppositions it cannot exercise a privileged form of arbitration, are socially describable in their consequences. But since these forms are random, incomplete and polyvalent it has to force them into some describable form. Rappaport provides a solution when he suggests that 'the unfalsifiable supported by the undeniable yields the unquestionable, which transforms the dubious, the arbitrary, and the conventional into the correct, the necessary and the nat- ural'.23 It is what can be rendered objective that enables effects to be described. Sociological responses to liturgical action have to return the issue to the transcendent it proclaims. The discipline always negates criteria or attempts that do otherwise than discount the social. As Berger suggests 'the genius of sociology is negative, and, paradoxically, it is as negation that sociology can make its best contribution to any positive cause'.24 This point applies especially to the efforts of the liturgical re- newal movement in the last few decades which have elicited much sociological hostility. 'Progressive' versions of liturgical forms, des- pite their supposed relevance and shaping to contemporary neces- sities and values are paradoxically indescribable in sociological terms. Their modes of regulation of rite are so socially fluid, their presuppositions become so tied to immediate communal inclina- tions, and their pliability of form are so prone to reductionist 438</page><page sequence="15">characterisations that they become dangerously close to Durkheim 's notion of ritual as a form of collective self-reflection. Because these rites are so fluid, and prone to discretion (in that subjective inclinations cancel objective elements in the detail of the ritual) their procedures are extremely difficult to characterise in ethno- graphic terms. For instance, if one compares the detail available in ritual accounts of the Azande or the Ndembu (to name a few classical studies) with what is available at an informal folk mass in an average parish, one can begin to understand sociological prob- lems of coping with sacramental instruments. The procedures of the former can be described and rendered intelligible despite the incredible nature of the belief system they attempt to realise. Mistakes, tacit assumptions and violations of ritual purity can be marked out, so that content is fused to form in an operative man- ner where the instrumental nature of the belief is objectively sec- ured in an unambiguous manner. It is ironic that the whole debate on ritual efficacy in the phil- osophy of social science has centred on the practices of some iso- lated 'primitive societies' to the virtual neglect of the products of the liturgical renewal movement supposedly concerned to make forms of rite credible to contemporary secular thought. Because sociology has a general interest in religion, some concern with lit- urgy had to arise, if nothing else, by default. There are many ques- tions liturgy raises that have a domestic interest within sociology. But if sociological studies of liturgy are to proceed, some attention will have to be paid to the issue of the minimum and maximum forms of action that render the Eucharist valid or invalid as a rite. Queries to theologians, usually result in references to intention, the wider powers of the Church, but no stipulation of what has to be done within the rite that makes it an instrumental success or failure for what the Sacrament realises. Until that issue is re- solved, sociologists are likely to remain muted about the instrumen- tal nature of Sacramental efficacy, and, to concentrate on the sense of religious experience, imagination, and feelings rites occasion. Certainly, they will continue to criticise misleading expectations being awarded to the social in rite; the mishandling of the ritual basis of liturgy; and misguided attempts to render forms relevant, representative and clear of ideological impurities, feminist, ecologi- cal or otherwise. Until theologians cease imputing an unthinking conservative (political and theological) bias to sociologists, the dia- logue about liturgical efficacy in social terms will never really get going. In the meantime, as some sociologists lean towards the for- mal, the describable and the ceremonially rich, a sneaking nostal- gia for Sarum rites might develop as part of the agenda of the 439</page><page sequence="16">indicate the means by which the ambiguity is to be resolved.
