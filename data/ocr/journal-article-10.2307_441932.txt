<plain_text><page sequence="1">Colonial Rhetoric and the Maternal Voice: Deconstruction and Disengagement in Virginia Woolf's The Voyage Out NICK MONTGOMERY At the heart of Virginia Woolf's The Voyage Out is a disengagement from the authority of the paternal word and an affirmation of the semiotic otherness of the maternal voice. The term semiotic here refers to those pri- marily aural, vocal, or physical qualities in language, such as rhythm, stress, repetition, echo, silence, and so on, that inform and can disrupt "literal" signification, and thus, by creating uncertainty, ambivalence, and paradox, destabilize meaning. Julia Kristeva distinguishes the semiotic, which she as- sociates with the voice and body of the mother, from the symbolic, which is bound up with the paternal word and the law of the father. Since the semiotic arises from the preoedipal, preobjectal, and prelinguistic phase of human development, however, it is essentially genderless, relating to the feminine rather than the female, as well as to the voice (and ear) rather than the word. It is installed in the subject as "semiotic disposition" (Desire in Language 7), a latency that is repressed once the infant enters into the symbolic code, but can be activated by exposure to the pressures in lan- guage referred to above. The semiotic and the symbolic are therefore sym- biotic and complementary, with the semiotic acting, so to speak, as the "other" of language, responsible for its inherent rhetoricity, for its affect. The disengagement in The Voyage Out from the paternal word or sym- bolic code emerges from the persistent defeat of verbalization evident in the curiously frustrated conversations and abortive utterances of the char- acters, and particularly in the sterile rhetoric of the Dalloways, who epito- 34</page><page sequence="2">THE VOYAGE OUT mize the complacency of colonialism. Deconstruction of the paternal word is also manifest in tropes relating to sound. There is an insistent focus on the brutal, mechanistic noises of industry, the alienating effects of new acoustic technologies (such as the telephone and the phonograph), and the primordial din of the jungles of South America, which ultimately un- dermines the coherence of colonial, patriarchal language. Thus an affirma- tion of the maternal voice is aligned with a subtle and cumulative interroga- tion of the hollowness of the colonial enterprise itself. The text's disenchantment with conventional rhetoric and social inter- course culminates, during the up-river sequence, in a stylized collapse of signification, a symbolic divestiture of the word, while there is a reciprocal investment in the purely vocal, as well as a gathering awareness throughout the text of the disruptive and uncanny power of sound. Simultaneously, the assumed impregnability of colonialism and the symbolic code is challenged in the indifferent otherness of the jungle. The way the novel develops can therefore be characterized as a response to the confining nature of its own language. There is a movement through and out of the discursive vapidity of colonial rhetoric and the paternal word and toward a reinstatement of the maternal voice. The semiotic stealthily emerges from the symbolic as the novel proceeds. Dissension from the authority of the paternal word and realignment with the other of the maternal voice occur most disruptively and explicitly toward the end of the novel, with the journey up-river and with Rachel's death, but the ground is prepared earlier by the way in which imperial or colonial rhetoric deconstructs and destabilizes itself throughout the text. The reading process is progressively a listening process where we increas- ingly share Woolf's acute ear for the concealed weaknesses and tropological instability of apparently uncontroversial rhetorical formulations. The un- raveling of the authority of colonial rhetoric centers around two particular tropes, the figure of inside/outside, and the metaphor of the state as ma- chine. We are partly alerted to this rhetorical self-deconstruction through its accompaniment by what might be characterized as a soundtrack, the in- creasingly insistent inscriptions within the narrative of inhuman noise and nonverbal vocalizations, so that the apparent coherence of the symbolic code is eroded by the alterity of sound and the increasingly explicit emer- gence of the semiotic. There is also a sense of aberration and imminent catastrophe in the implied dissolution of boundaries between human and inhuman, in the concussions of engines and the creaking and throbbing of machinery, in the "melancholy moan" (Voyage Out 9) of the steamer and the alien sounds of ocean and jungle. The instantaneity of such sounds produces a special 35</page><page sequence="3">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE sort of unmediated registration of history.' Although Woolf is not necessar- ily in a position to construct an explicit critique, the "ear" of the author detects and records the traces of industrial capitalism's structural and his- torical crises as well as the dissonances and fissures inherent in the colonial enterprise itself. If history, or referentiality, is to be found anywhere, it is perhaps through the open, undefended orifice of the ear. The continuous assimilatory operations of the ear predispose it to the detection of discord in rhetoric and what Barthes calls the "pulsional incidents" (66-67) in lan- guage, those rhythms, percussions, and discords that subvert the assumed transparency and infallibility of the paternal word. Things can sound wrong even when they look right and, in this respect, The Voyage Out is a novel that listens to itself in an increasingly puzzled and dissatisfied way. In arguing this, I'll also suggest that the new acoustic technologies, like the telephone and the gramophone-enabling both language's ironic duplication and its alienating, subversive exteriorization-pose an additional threat to the in- tegrity and immunity of the word. EMBARKATION/EXTRICATION The very title of The Voyage Out asks to be listened to and interrogated. As an announcement of what is to follow, it stipulates a movement from an inside to an outside, a passage through or across boundaries, while leav- ing the nature of the voyage, the place of departure, and the destination obscure. In fact, the definite article, affirming the singularity of the jour- ney, seems the most stable and solid element of the title. Out is a sweeping deictic gesture toward what Homi Bhabha calls the "beyond" (26),2 indicat- ing everything that is not "in" and activating all of the epistemological im- plications and problems of the opposition inside/outside. Boundaries to be traversed, the reader might suppose, could include those between home and the wider world, between interiority and exteriority, between known center and exotic periphery, or perhaps between the patriarchal establish- ment and some other, oppositional space. The title also suggests a setting forth into language, the initiation of the author into the public domain of literary production (it was Woolf's first novel), and the embarkation of the reader into the unknown terrain of the text, voyages that could be seen as acts of colonization as well as inaugura- tion. In addition, the title implies a potential voyage back to complete the project, the protagonist returning perhaps transfigured and enriched, to the overall aggrandizement of the inside and the impoverishment of the outside. The fact that the novel confounds this lurking expectation and with- holds the voyage back is one measure of its engagement with the rhetoric 36</page><page sequence="4">THE VOYAGE OUT of colonialism and the discursive mechanisms of empire, indicating that the outward movement has not merely been an exotic, voyeuristic, or thera- peutic sortie in pursuit of the rejuvenation of the paternal word, but a more permanent evacuation from that dominant rhetoric. Once out, we remain out. In this sense, the novel is an act of extrication. The actual process of embarkation is interestingly handled by Woolf. The somewhat stilted and disjointed small talk between the characters in- cludes some significant remarks about "putting things off' and the diffi- culty of setting out. Ridley Ambrose confesses to having a "weakness for people who can't begin" (10), while the rapid changes of conversational topic, the interruptions, the unfinished sentences, and the dashes and dot- ted lines suggest not only what Lucio Ruotolo describes as a "dynamic of disjunction" (99)3 but also the problem of embarking on the fictional project itself. The value of setting out, the very fact of movement and of extrication from a paralyzing social and cultural tradition, would seem to be symbolized by the image of London as seen from the river. To Rachel it "seemed dreadful that the town should blaze forever in the same spot... a circumscribed mound, eternally burnt, eternally scarred . . . a sedentary miser" (11). Her impression of the city at once suggests the relentless, com- bustible activity of patriarchal capitalism and its intrinsically self-consum- ing, self-defeating processes. Once the Euphrosyne is at sea, there is a "long interval of constraint and silence" (15) signaling a shift in the register, substance, and continuity of conversation. Replacing the trivial and disjointed exchanges that had gone before, Mr. Pepper begins a sustained "discourse, addressed to nobody," describing "the great white monsters of the lower waters . .. which would explode if you brought them to the surface," introducing a primordial oth- erness that Woolf will explore in more detail in the South American se- quences. Echoing the start of Marlow's narrative in Heart of Darkness, Mr. Pepper adopts the posture of a Buddha with his "arms encircling his knees" (15-16), further establishing the colonial theme by explaining how he was "condemned to pass the susceptible years of youth in a railway station in Bombay" (18). Presently, all of the passengers follow Helen Ambrose onto the deck to discover that the "ship was out in a wide space of sea." They realize that they are "free of roads, free of mankind" (20), and the process of extrication, for novelist as well as characters, has begun. 37</page><page sequence="5">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE THE IMPERIAL MACHINE T o be on the inside of the British Empire, the novel suggests, means to be an organism within a machine, to be, in other words, the subject of a mixed metaphor. Richard Dalloway provides an explicit, if inadvertent, exposition of this paradoxical and unstable predicament during his patron- izing catechism of Rachel Vinrace in chapter 4 of the novel: I can conceive of no more exalted aim-to be the citizen of the Em- pire. Look at it in this way, Miss Vinrace; conceive the state as a complicated machine; some fulfil the important duties; others (per- haps I am one of them) serve only to connect some obscure parts of the mechanism, concealed from the public eye. Yet if the meanest screw fails in its task, the proper working of the whole is imperilled. (57) Immediately before this, though, Dalloway has insisted that a "human be- ing is not a set of compartments, but an organism." The imperial subject, therefore, in the formulation of a declared agent of empire, is an organism performing the function of a screw in a machine. Rachel's attempt to visu- alize this hybrid rhetorical aberration, the human subject, a "lean black widow, gazing out of her window," fused together with the "vast machine" of which she is a component, collapses into the onomatopoeic registration of mechanized sound, the "thumping, thumping, thumping" of a machine "such as one sees at South Kensington." (57) For Rachel Vinrace, then, the empire becomes an aberrant metaphor that dissolves into the intrusive alterity of throbbing, industrial noise. And this trope, once on the move, is difficult to stop. The pulse of the machine, imagined by Rachel, reverberates like the beat of a heart, so that the ma- chine itself is like an organism, and conversely, the human subject like a machine. The word thumping reverberates like the sound it describes, refer- ring back to itself in an apparent closed circuit. But a thump can also be a blow, an act of aggression against the person, so that the noise of the ma- chine becomes an assault on one of its own "obscure parts," striking at the organism that animates and infests it, through the delicate membrane of its ear. And this antagonism between automaton and human, the impulse of the former to attack and purge itself of the latter, accurately describes the unsustainable relationship between the industrial-imperial complex and its constituent subjects. The brutality and alienation of the industrial process, its travesty of human rhythms and social practices, is concealed from view but is heard nonetheless. (Woolf frequently describes the experience of the human subject in the modern world in terms of delicate membranes and 38</page><page sequence="6">THE VOYAGE OUT concussive "sledge-hammer" blows, notably in "A Sketch of the Past" [78]). This disturbing catachresis, picturing the state as a machine held to- gether with organic components, seems to oscillate its way back to itself, very much following the circular trajectory that Paul de Man predicts for all substitutional tropes in "The Epistemology of Metaphor."4 The substitu- tional structure of a metaphor, its inherent translatability, creates a "per- petual motion that never moves beyond tautology" (38), so that its attempt at definition is doomed to futile circularity or oscillation, just as the meta- phors unleashed by Richard Dalloway rehearse the pointless perpetual mo- tion of the industrial-imperial process he is attempting to valorize. Asked earlier by Rachel to express his "ideal," Dalloway replies "Unity. Unity of aim, of dominion, of progress. The dispersion of the best ideas over the greatest area" (55). This utterance has the compact rhythms of rehearsed rhetoric, the sterile received wisdom of the paternal word, and while it appears to epitomize the imperial ideal, it once again suggests the monolithic operations of a machine. The repetition of the word unity and the rhythmical accumulation of modifying phrases, in sonorous triplicate, seem to replicate the inflexible purpose and inexorable momentum of the imperial enterprise, while the balance of superlatives in the second sentence suggests an inarguable logic. It is a rhetorical formulation designed to be self-containing, airtight, structured to prohibit the pursuit and full realiza- tion of the very tropes it sets in motion-the tropes from which it derives its authority as utterance. Like most rhetoric, however, it can be shown to be self-sabotaging, vulnerable to the "other" logic of grammar. The mere repetition of the word unity, which on one level insists on the integrity and singularity of the concept, also represents a duplication, a split- ting or pluralization at odds with the intention of the word's reiteration. Moreover, on close inspection, "unity" and "dispersion" resonate as anti- thetical impulses, while "dominion" and "progress" can scarcely claim any automatic affinity. Dominion still carries traces of its archaic, feudal, etymo- logical ancestry, translating as sovereignty, an absolute and intrinsically static condition, whereas progress connotes perpetual advancement, owing its pe- culiarly aggressive technological associations to an American rehabilitation of the obsolete English verb form. In a nicely circular irony, American so- cial, economic, and technological progress really took off only when America ceased to be a colony, or "dominion," of Britain. This tension or incompatibility between "dominion" and "progress," therefore, further un- dermines the coherence of the original proposition, "unity of aim," the rhe- torical formulation unraveling in a way that is analogous to the eventual historical disintegration of the British Empire itself. The self-canceling dynamic that exists between "unity" and "dispersion" 39</page><page sequence="7">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE is more neatly encapsulated in an image from Between the Acts, where the onomatopoeic scratching of a gramophone repeatedly gurgles "Unity - dispersity " (1 19)5-an image of suspension, paralysis even, with the machine itself stuck in deadlock between the centrifugal spin of the disc and the centripetal trajectory of the needle arm. Furthermore, while the gramo- phone seems to capture, mimic, and exploit sound, it also splits that sound off from its originary source, separating the human voice from the body and the self, transforming it into a kind of uncanny simulacrum or virtual voice. Homi Bhabha has shown how an analogous pattern of duplication or mimicry takes place in the practices and discourses of colonialism, so that "mimicry represents an ironic compromise" between "the synchronic pan- optical vision of domination-the demand for identity, stasis-and the counter pressure of the diachrony of history-change, difference" (86). Concealed within Richard Dalloway's glib rhetoric of "dominion" and "progress," therefore, are the very dispersive, antagonistic forces that will ultimately explode the "unity" that is his cherished ideal. When Richard Dalloway goes on to assert that "no woman" has "states- manship," or "the political instinct" (58), he commits himself to another, rather more self-evident tautology (namely that women do not advertise at- tributes in themselves that have been prohibited, that they are outside of something into which they have not been admitted), but this also has the effect of spurring Rachel into a more coherent and forward-looking eluci- dation of the "machine" of the state than Richard himself was able to mus- ter: "Under the streets, in the sewers, in the wires, in the telephones, there is something alive; is that what you mean?" (58). In Rachel's formulation, Dalloway's grotesque organism-as-screw figure modulates into something more like a ghost in the machine, anticipating the virtual spaces and the rhetoric of intersections and networks typical of modernity and postmo- dernity. Whereas his imagery dwells on the mechanics of industrial produc- tion, evoking the "thumping" of steam engines, she looks to the revolution in communications, particularly imagining the new acoustic technologies for the long-range transmission of language and the human voice. Steven Connor has suggested how the development of the telephone contributed to a conceptual reconfiguration of space, its simultaneous "immensification" and collapse, leading to the paradoxical experience of a remote intimacy, along with the increasing familiarity of the virtual space of a switchboard, inhabited by a spectral operator (211).6 Certainly there is a more sophisticated spatialization of the imperial machine in Rachel's de- scription, with its sense of the subterranean and overhead dimensions and the multiple technologies involved in sustaining, connecting, and modern- izing a global empire. There is also, though, a strong hint of the sentient, 40</page><page sequence="8">THE VOYAGE OUT suggesting the monstrosity of the intelligent and self-serving machine. The phonemic patterning and the parallelism of phrase vocalize a concealed anxiety about the momentum and acceleration of this technological revo- lution. This sense of a monstrous, entropic potential is more explicitly ar- ticulated later, when Rachel expresses the belief that "the world might change in a minute and anything appear" (132). In Jacob's Room, Woolf more fully registers the potentially alienating properties of new acoustic technology, the "distancing and exteriorization" that introduce "absence, spacing and exorbitance into the voice" (Connor 217): And the telephones ring. And everywhere we go wires and tubes surround us to carry the voices that try to penetrate before the last cards are dealt and the days are over. 'Try to penetrate,' for as we lift the cup, shake the hand, express the hope, something whispers, Is this all? (Jacob's Room 80) While Woolf here sees something affirmative in the will to communicate, the insistence of the phrase try to penetrate also suggests the invasiveness of acoustic technology, its destabilization of the inside/outside opposition, while the image of encirclement by "wires and tubes" implies captivity, hint- ing at the general pervasiveness of the auditory and the peculiar vulnerabil- ity of the ear. The sinuous and stealthy proliferation of acoustic technology, juxtaposed with the finite and fleeting "days" of the human subject, here seems to suggest something malign and sinister about the living machine invoked earlier by Rachel Vinrace. At the heart of any machine is the motor or engine, and the metropolis is the engine at the heart of the imperial machine. Like Conrad's Heart of Darkness, The Voyage Out begins in London, the epicenter of English imperi- alism, and on the Thames, its main artery. Whereas Conrad's metropolis "broods" motionless and silent under a "mournful gloom" (27), already somewhat remote from Gravesend where the Nellie is actually moored, Woolf's London is more immediate, more fully realized as a place of fre- netic activity and strident, disorganized, and invasive noise. "Shooting mo- tor cars," "thundering drays" and "jingling hansoms" break the "fixity" of Mrs. Ambrose's stricken mood as she makes her way to the river, reminding her of "the world she lived in" (5), a world on the cusp of a modernity where horse and combustion engine, organism and machine, still uneasily coexist at the service of the greater engine of the state. For most of the opening sequence, though, Mrs. Ambrose moves through the city in a state of dis- tress and disorientation, her vision blurred by the "tremulous medium" of tears, an optical interference that renders her more reliant on the aural 41</page><page sequence="9">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE and more susceptible to the alterity of noises whose origins cannot be visu- ally confirmed. She is strangely dissociated from her husband, whose disembodied voice, imperviously reciting poetry, "struck close upon her ears." Again, the apprehension of sound by the subject is rendered in terms of a blow, in a trope that, as it were, merely masquerades as a metaphor and quickly con- fesses its tautological nature, since the idea of sound striking the ear liter- ally describes the miniaturized concussive violence involved in hearing. Derrida has observed that "the ear is the most tendered and open organ," the one that "the infant cannot close," an undefendable conduit between inside and outside, also noting its "invaginated folds" and "involuted orificiality" (36).7 Recalling the penetrative quality of sound emphasized in the passage quoted earlier from Jacob's Room, the apparent transparency of the image of Mr. Ambrose's voice striking his wife's ears now clouds over again with suggestions of penetrative intrusion and the uninvited coloniza- tion of another's bodily and psychic space. That her husband is intoning a fragment of popular Victorian poetry, the opening lines of one of the Lays of Ancient Rome by Thomas Babington Macaulay (along with incidental ref- erences to the Sphinx, Constantinople, and Waterloo Bridge), would ap- pear to strengthen the presence of empire and coloniality in the language of this brief episode. We are reminded that colonization and the "domin- ion" of the paternal word begin at home and include an intimate, interper- sonal dimension. As the voyage out finally gets under way, Mr. Pepper and Ridley Ambrose are conducting an apparently incidental conversation about a shared Cam- bridge acquaintance, Jenkinson of Peterhouse, when the aberrant concat- enation of the mechanical and the organic surfaces again. Jenkinson is de- scribed as having "a screw loose somewhere," a metaphor equating mind and machine and anticipating Richard Dalloway's subsequent conceptual- ization of the state as an apparatus dependent on "the meanest screw." It turns out thatJenkinson's "loose screw" amounts to little more than social and intellectual nonconformism, that he married a young woman out of a tobacconist's, produced an unorthodox theory about the planets, and took to drink and drugs (9). As a part of the greater machine, though,Jenkinson is malfunctioning, with the fault located in the condemned component rather than outside, in the wider operations of the supposedly infallible so- cial apparatus. Interestingly, Mr. Pepper's remark seems to activate the machinery of the ship, which manifests itself in noise and vibration, a tremor through the table, an electric bell ringing "sharply again and again," and a "loud melan- choly moan" which is answered by other equally "sad" ships on the river. 42</page><page sequence="10">THE VOYAGE OUT The metaphor of an organism with a loose screw is therefore succeeded by the prosopopoeia of the machine with a voice, whose melancholy utterance is itself mocked by the "chuckling and hissing" (9) of the water as the voy- age gets under way. The passengers are now confined to the microworld of the ship, a miniature island state that is quite literally a machine. Later, when the "sinister grey" (60) shapes of warships are spotted on the horizon, we are reminded that the imminent consequences of Dalloway's mixed meta- phor, the machine-organism aberration, will be the mass production of death in the first industrial war, a war of cavalry and machine guns. Once again, these small traces of history, lodged in the rhetorical tropes of The Voyage Out, are more fully articulated in the soundscapes of Jacob's Room. There are many passages in which Woolf seems concerned to indi- cate the simultaneous stasis and ephemerality of the moment through a concentrated documentation of sounds and overheard voices. In one such sequence, Fanny Elmer, sitting on a bench at Hampstead Garden Suburb, is assailed by random and inescapable noise: "A dog barked, barked, barked down in the hollow" and "went on barking" while "motor cars hooted on the road." There is a "far away rush and humming" and children are "screaming" while the wind scatters their "voices all about." She hears "some cry," then a "workman's whistle," a "thrush trilling out into the warm air," and then "the humming of wheels and the wind rushing" (102-3). Behind it all the war resonates quietly like a background drone. As in The Voyage Out, Woolf meditates in the later novel on the sounds of the machines that make up the larger mechanism of the empire, the "steamers, resounding like gigantic tuning forks," which "state the old old fact-how there is a sea coldly, greenly, swaying outside." The otherness of the sea outside of the vessel is clearly registered here, but she seems more concerned to discriminate the acoustic nuances of nationalism or patrio- tism "in the thin voice of duty, piping in a white thread from the top of a funnel" and to observe that "nowadays" it is military vessels that "collect the largest multitudes." Night becomes "nothing but a long-drawn sigh between hammer-strokes, a deep breath-you can hear it from an open window even in the heart of London" (142). Once again, the machine of state makes itself heard in the brutal, repetitive percussions of mass production and in its very absence-in the organic human "sigh" of nocturnal remission from the pervasive noise. 43</page><page sequence="11">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE n The Voyage Out, the structures, protocols, and practices of English soci- ety are duplicated and miniaturized aboard the Euphrosyne as it steams into the "empty universe" of the ocean, its passengers cocooned from the unknown, elemental outside. This simultaneous replication of and removal from the center, from the imperial homeland, provokes a rupture in the way the diegetic narrative voice imagines England. On the one hand, it is recalled nostalgically in terms of a pastoral idyll of village churches, bloom- ing gardens, and genteel domesticated contentment, diegetic detachment combining with anonymous and generalized mimetic utterances. On the other hand, with the narrative voice now loosely affiliated with the general- ity of "people in ships," England becomes a "shrinking island in which people were imprisoned," "swarming about like aimless ants" (23-24). In both scenarios, the landscape is also imagined as soundscape, a symptom partly of its invisibility from the ship, but also a measure of the way in which nationhood is substantially the product of utterance and rhetoric, the patri- archal word, notable here in that the acoustic details of these soundscapes are predominantly vocalic. The first motif, the pastoral idealization of England, evokes a sonorous space of intimate utterances, ecstatic cries and whispers, "confidences and expressions of love that were heard not only in cornfields but in lamplit rooms" (24), a remote aural voyeurism that curiously resembles the intru- sions later associated with the hidden microphone. Odd echoes of Darwin- ian or atheistical controversy infiltrate this gentle national soundscape, soft- ened by the filter of nostalgic idyll and imagined as generalized and stylized exchanges, with "some" people saying "that the sky was an emblem of the life they had had" and others "that it was the promise of the life to come." As if to register the underlying crisis of certainty that, from a vantage point outside, seems to afflict the national psyche, the mellow pastoral tones are shattered by an exotic image of "long-tailed birds" that "clattered and screamed, and crossed from wood to wood, with golden eyes in their plum- age" (24), a cacophonous reminder of alien but related species and a sub- merged prehistory which will be more fully encountered later in the novel. The version of England as a "swarming" prison, in contrast to the inti- mate utterances of the preceding pastoral soundscape, is registered as a "vain clamour, which being unheard, either ceased, or rose into a brawl." "Clamour" and "brawl" suggest inarticulate, public, and collective noise, voices without words, but noise that is "vain" and strangely "unheard" (24), whereas the private sweet nothings of rural England are mysteriously au- dible and intelligible. The uneven reception of these imagined noises, 44</page><page sequence="12">THE VOYAGE OUT reaching the outside from the center, suggests England's segmentation into sound-proofed, mutually incomprehensible enclaves, a kind of acoustic simulation of its social, cultural, and political divisions that is thoroughly at odds with Richard Dalloway's subsequent assertion of the supposed "unity" underlying the whole national and imperial enterprise. Presently, England is remote enough for its people to be "completely mute" (24), an observation that anticipates subsequent episodes of speech- lessness and silence amongst the tourists in the South American episodes. It is only with the arrival on board of the Dalloways that the relatively pro- gressive and enlightened attitudes of the existing passengers are thrown into relief, and the prewar political antagonisms between Liberals and Conser- vatives are rehearsed within the microsociety of the ship. For Clarissa Dalloway, the experience of being in the "beyond" provokes a vague and revealing idealization of "what it really means to be English": One thinks of all we've done, and our navies, and the people in In- dia and Africa, and how we've gone on century after century, send- ing our boys from little country villages-and of men like you Dick, and it makes one feel as if one couldn't bear not to be English! (42) The curiously unconvincing effect of this formulation, the sense of a baffled rhetorical impotence, would appear to be a good example of what de Man calls "referential aberration" or "aberrant referentiality," (47) where rheto- ric and grammar sabotage each other to produce a historically meaningful distortion or cancellation of meaning. To start with, the grammatical discontinuities and phonemic disso- nances undermine the central proposition about continuity. The opening assertion hinges on the verb done ("One thinks of all we've done"), denot- ing actions successfully accomplished, a rhetorical gambit that promises verb-dominated, equally actional development and elaboration. Instead it is succeeded by a noun phrase ("and our navies") that, far from evoking heroic deeds, suggests inertia, the verb being conspicuously absent. The grammatical discontinuity releases a certain absurdity at the level of the sig- nified, implying either the immobility of the navies or the impenetrable secrecy of their activities. The elision of the verb from the next noun phrase ("and the people in India and Africa") further mystifies the nature of the accomplished actions that the opening assertion promised to enumerate, and the absence of any semantic link between the adjacent phrases reveals an equivalent referen- tial incongruity, the historically arbitrary contiguity of British navies and the people in India and Africa. By the time the explicit exposition of continuity arrives ("and how we've gone on century after century"), what had evidently 45</page><page sequence="13">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE started out as rhetorical affirmation has become an utterance in pursuit of its own justification, in danger of collapsing into its own absences. The rep- etition of the word century, instead of evoking diachrony, only further be- trays the precarious instantaneity of the utterance, its vocalic ephemerality. The deictic gesture toward Dick seems like a desperate diversionary tactic in this context, allowing Clarissa to reach the double negative of her en- tirely unjustified peroration with some illusory semblance of coherence. The preponderance of conjunctions throughout the passage simulates a breath- less orality, but instead of assembling a cumulative rationale, it enacts its ceaseless deferral; and the juxtaposition of impersonal and collective pro- nouns inscribes social division rather than national solidarity. Instead of constructing ajustification of English imperialism, then, Clarissa Dalloway's rhetorical essay has deconstructed itself, disclosing the arbitrariness of co- lonialism and the fissures within English society itself. Following the rhetorical and grammatical discontinuities of Clarissa's utterances, Woolf pushes the satire further: Richard Dalloway imagines the continuity his wife has attempted to evoke, but in starkly linear terms, re- ducing the complexity of history to simple chronological succession. In fact, linearity itself dwindles to the mere superstition of lineage and the unques- tioning reiteration of the paternal word, in the incantatory formulation of "King following King, Prime Minister Prime Minister, and Law Law" (43). Here, the profound inertia of self-duplicating and arbitrary sovereignty is revealed as absurd, unconnected repetition, the phonemes detonating like the "thumping" of the insentient machine imagined by Rachel. COLONIAL RHETORIC AND THE SONOROUS ENVELOPE W oolf establishes the South American colonial location in the novel through the use of a largely conventional and orthodox imperial rhetoric, conforming closely to aspects of the schematization formulated by David Spurr.8 The excursion to Monte Rosa, for example, is a miniature reenactment of the original colonial enterprise, permitting a masterful vi- sual surveillance of the "infinite distances of South America" (120). When Evelyn exclaims "Splendid!" and Miss Allan registers the points of the com- pass, "North-South-East-West," they complete a concise description and aestheticization of the scene, thereby taking discursive possession of it and subordinating it to the "power of the speaker" (Spurr 18). A similar moment of surveillance opens chapter 16, with Rachel and Hewet positioned on the edge of a cliff and therefore able to gaze both inland and seaward. Other imperial rhetorical strategies come into play here, with the inland gaze registering the nameless villages and hills as nega- 46</page><page sequence="14">THE VOYAGE OUT tive space, part of a wider strategy of negation that, like Marlow in Heart of Darkness, characterizes uncolonized lands as "blank spaces of the earth" (33), inviting occupation and the discursive mastery implicit in naming. Thus the view is recorded in terms of its emptiness and namelessness, a space of "infi- nite sun-dried earth ... like the immense floor of the sea" (194), devoid of language and history, and ready to be "naturalized" or "aestheticized" and "charged with any one of a number of values: nature as abundance, as ab- sence, as original innocence, as unbridled destruction, as eternal cycle, as constant progression" (Spurr 168). When the view is turned seaward, there is an explicit inversion of Conrad's description of the Thames as "a water- way leading to the uttermost ends of the earth" (28), with the sea this time nostalgically envisaged as flowing "up to the mouth of the Thames" which "washed the roots of the city of London," the marine medium operating in both cases as a kind of invitation to adventure, colonization, and the dis- semination of the paternal word. With the Conradian journey up-river in chapter 20, however, the impe- rial rhetoric undergoes a singular dissolution or loss of affect. The rhetori- cal strategies of insubstantialization and eroticization, discursive responses to an encounter with the alterity of so-called primitive cultures, are afflicted by a progressive disembodiment, fragmentation, and unintelligibility of the speaking voice. By insubstantialization, Spurr means the disorienting or joy- ful dissolution of the subject into a semihallucinatory state, often presented in terms of the rhetoric of the "visionary experience" and accompanied by "surrender, submission or abandonment" on the part of the subject (145). Chapter 20 of The Voyage Out certainly has this hallucinated quality, strik- ingly registered in the otherness of the acoustic details, the "croakings" and "sudden cries" of animals, the "flapping of great wings," and pervasive "creaking and sighing sounds" (256-57), along with equally disturbing epi- sodes of silence. The wilderness is also erotically charged with a superabun- dance of color, of animal and vegetable fecundity, again in accordance with Spurr's schematization of imperial rhetoric. Where Woolf deviates from this scheme, or at least gives it a distinctly anticolonial orientation, is in the pro- gressive disintegration of meaningful utterance, the incipient collapse of the symbolic order, and the creeping incapacity of the spoken word to carry meaning between one human subject and another. In a return to the pre- history of the subject, the rhetoric of the imperial machine-the authority of the paternal word-is supplanted by the "sonorous envelope" of the ma- ternal voice. Kaja Silverman provides a concise summary of some of the positions taken regarding the role of the maternal voice in the formation of the sub- ject.' Central to all of the perspectives identified by Silverman is the idea of 47</page><page sequence="15">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE a kind of acoustic cocoon woven around the newborn infant by the sound of the mother's voice. It is variously characterized as a "bath of sounds" (Didier Anzieu), a "sonorous envelope," (Guy Rosalato and Mary Ann Doane), an "umbilical net" (Michel Chion), and a "mobile receptacle" (Julia Kristeva's more familiar chora). Silverman characterizes the sonorous enve- lope and the umbilical net as the utopian and dystopian extremes amongst these retrospective conceptualizations of the maternal voice. The former sees the space created by the maternal voice as an envelope of blissful, "op- eratic" plenitude and "celestial melody," a "primordial listening experience" that is the "prototype for all subsequent auditory pleasure" (Silverman 84- 85). Within the terms of this model, the maternal voice itself is a lost object, the lack of which accounts (along with other lost objects) for the subject's incompleteness and desire. Michel Chion's formulation, on the other hand, imagines the enclosure described by the maternal voice as a place of en- trapment, an "umbilical net" or "cobweb" (Silverman 74), a "uterine night of nonmeaning" from which the infant is delivered by its entry into the sym- bolic code. Chion opposes the maternal voice to the paternal word, thereby identifying the "mother with sound and the father with meaning" (Silverman 75). Once securely situated outside of the umbilical web, the subject comes to associate the maternal voice with infantile babble, the "vo- cal and auditory afterbirth" (81) that has been repudiated by the paternal word. Silverman shows that both of these formulations hinge on the figure inside/outside, and that for a movement from one to the other to be pos- sible, for the infant to emerge outside of the sonorous envelope or umbili- cal net, an inside has to be left behind. The trope inside/outside, there- fore, effectively abandons the mother in the space created by her own voice, in the auditory enclosure evacuated by the infant, in nonmeaning, babble, and vocalic rather than verbal sonority. Silverman sees this as a "disavowal of the mother's role both as an agent of discourse and as a model for lin- guistic identification" as well as an "alignment of femininity with an unplea- surable and disempowering interiority" (100). Julia Kristeva's ideas about the maternal voice also rely on the trope inside/outside, though in a more complex and ambiguous way. The mother's voice, along with "the breast, given and withdrawn" and "lamplight capturing the gaze" (Desire in Language 283),10 helps to constitute the primi- tive space of the chora, a term adapted from Plato to designate a "mater- nally connoted" receptacle, "improbable, hybrid, anterior to naming" (133), and therefore suitably premature in relation to the paternal word or sym- bolic code. These archaic "markers" are the first coordinates of "spatiality" and help to absorb and inhibit the first vocalizations or "distress calls" of the infant, which Kristeva calls anaclises (282). At this stage, "there is not yet 48</page><page sequence="16">THE VOYAGE OUT an outside" or an inside, only the unity or totality of mother and infant. Clearly, at this point, the inside/outside opposition is under strain as a rhe- torical formulation, even allowing for the fact that Kristeva is assuming the perspective of the infant. The figure, like all binary oppositions, is predi- cated on its symmetry, so that there must be an outside for there to be an inside. If there is neither, then identity (including the identity of the signi- fier) is deprived of the materials out of which it makes itself. In one sense, therefore, the collapse of the trope into paradox is an entirely consistent function of the interdependence of the symbolic and semiotic regimes, and what Kristeva calls the improbability of the chora. Furthermore, Kristeva ar- gues that the chora is sublimated, once the subject has entered the symbolic code, as "semiotic disposition," capable of reactivation as sublime or abject experience, thus surviving as the source of artistic and poetic sensibility (Powers of Horror 208). As retrospective theorizations of origins, these ideas seem peculiarly relevant to the later episodes of Woolf's novel, especially the up-river sequence, suggesting as it does an encounter with prehistory and the evolutionary past. For Hewet and Rachel, the excursion into the wilderness becomes a sublime release from the symbolic order, an episode of remission from the authority of the paternal word and a reexperience of the maternal voice, a reentry into the musical bliss of an originary acoustic cocoon. For Helen Ambrose, on the other hand, the experience is disturbing and uncanny, a presentiment of "disaster" (270), a similar reexperience of the maternal voice, but this time as abjection. This contrast to some extent reflects the dispositions of the relative characters with regard to the paternal word and the symbolic order, their respective levels of commitment to the structures and authority of the patriarchal machine, and therefore their degrees of anxiety at the withdrawal or dissolution of this authority. As the party journeys up-river into the "darkness," Hewet feels the boat "in some strange way" becomes "identified with himself": He was drawn on and on away from all he knew, slipping over barri- ers and past landmarks into unknown waters as the boat glided over the smooth surface of the river. In profound peace, enveloped in deeper unconsciousness than had been his for many nights, he lay on deck watching the tree-tops ... (252) This passage clearly suggests the blissful plenitude of the more affirmative model of the sonorous envelope, a reimmersion in the preconscious or pre- natal, Kristeva's "semiotic enclosure" or chora. His "baptism" seems to sensi- tize Hewet to the sounds of the forest, which "echoed like a hall." The cries of animals are described in almost exclusively anthropomorphic terms, the 49</page><page sequence="17">TWENTIETH CENTUR Y LITERATURE "wild laugh" (253) of a bird, the chuckling of a monkey, the shriek of a parrot, suggesting the paradoxical strangeness and familiarity of the word- less human voice, and connecting with the semiotic disposition latent within the subject. The progressive ascendancy of the purely vocal, the call of the other, is paralleled by a reciprocal diminution and designification of the verbal. The words he tries to read "flicker" and go out (253), and the utter- ances of the others are increasingly registered as unintelligible murmurings and mutterings. Helen Ambrose is similarly affected. Hirst's description of the forest as "beautiful" seems to her a "strange little word" (254). When Hewet and Rachel leave the others to explore the forest, and he attempts to talk to her, "he did not seem to be speaking or she to be hearing," and their voicesjoin in "tones of strange unfamiliar sound which formed no words." Rejoining the party, he finds himself "using curiously sharp, meaningless words," while their conversation consists of "little meaningless words floating high in the air" (262). As they near the native settlement, Rachel and Hewet try to re- call their moment of intimacy in the forest, but "so beautiful was the sound of their voices that ... they scarcely listened to the words they framed," and they simply repeat each other's utterances, savoring the acoustic pleasure of echo over signification. Later, they comment that Helen has a "beautiful voice" (273). On board the ship, "words crossed the darkness, but, not know- ing where they fell seemed to lack energy and substance" (271). "Broken fragments of speech" reach them "in one vast wave" (268). Language has dissolved into what Lucio Ruotolo has described as a "rhythm of broken sequence ... an aesthetic of disjunction" (2), a dynamic that will reach its apotheosis in Between the Acts. That they have momentarily reentered originary, maternal spaces during their foray into the jungle is further sug- gested by their movement up a "wide pathway striking through the forest" toward "star-shaped crimson blossoms" to the accompaniment of "creaking and sighing sounds" (256). For Helen, on the other hand, the defamiliarization and designification of the verbal is "strange" and uncanny, and leaves her feeling "exposed to presentiments of disaster" for "having ventured too far and exposed them- selves"; the cries of the beasts strike her as "senseless" (270). Instead of sub- lime musicality, she is subject to what Kristeva calls the "massive uncanni- ness" of abjection (Powers of Horror 2),11 menaced by the profound incom- patibility (and paradoxical interdependence) of the semiotic and the sym- bolic codes, and by the evaporating coherence of the paternal word. Her most intense responses, her sense of defamiliarization and imminent catas- trophe, are triggered by her encounter with the native people of the settle- 50</page><page sequence="18">THE VOYAGE OUT ment, recalling Kristeva's explanation of the reflex rejection of the "for- eigner": In the fascinated rejection that the foreigner arouses in us, there is a share of uncanny strangeness in the sense of the depersonaliza- tion that Freud discovered in it, and which takes up again our in- fantile desires and fears of the other-the other of death, the other of woman, the other of uncontrollable drive. The foreigner is within us. And when we flee from or struggle against the foreigner, we are fighting our unconscious-that "impossible" facet of our "own and proper." (Strangers to Ourselves 91) Helen's presentiments of disaster and sense of unreality can therefore be seen as a reaction against the infantile, forgotten stranger within herself, whose half-remembered encounter with the other she can neither fully ex- tinguish nor wholly assimilate. The foreign voices of the natives and the "cries of the senseless beasts" (270) activate incompletely sublimated memo- ries of the maternal voice, this time figured as the horror of abjection, or the suffocating captivity of the umbilical web. MUSIC AND THE MATERNAL VOICE Rachel's affirmation of sound over words is made explicit in chapter 22, where she denounces "novels and plays and histories" as "sheer non- sense" and challenges Hewet to "think of words compared with sounds!" (276). This completes an association of her character with music that has pervaded the whole text. This association is so emphatic that we are told she "was allowed to learn nothing but music," to the extent that she be- comes a "fanatic" (26) about it to the exclusion of her wider educational, social, and sexual development. Having been brought up by two aunts and having "few friends of her own age," she is ignorant about sex and does not "care for books," coming across knowledge only in "repulsive chunks" (27), suggesting a continuing attachment to childhood and an incomplete as- similation by the authority of the paternal word. This is supported by the numerous mother figures Rachel encounters during the course of the novel, as well as by her evident apathy toward category, classification, and system. When describing William Pepper to her aunt, for example, her list of his accomplishments moves without irony from mathematics, history, and the classics to coins and "vehicular traffic" (12). Mr. Pepper's pedantic and in- discriminate autodidacticism is the main target of Woolf's irony, but the episode also establishes that Rachel remains relatively detached from "mas- culine" epistemological structures, hierarchies, and habits of thought. 51</page><page sequence="19">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE The more utopian account of the sonorous envelope argues that the "primordial listening experience" of the maternal voice is the "prototype for all subsequent auditory pleasure, especially the pleasure that derives from music" (Rosalato 81). Rachel's musicality would appear to affiliate her from the start, therefore, with the semiotic chora, or what Guy Rosalato calls the "original atmosphere" of the "sonorous womb" (81). Bach is her pre- ferred composer, and it is his music that she plays at the close of the dance shortly after the arrival in South America. It is also her musical sensibility that most forcibly distinguishes her from the Dalloways and helps her to reassert a critical distance from them, repulsing their attempts to absorb her into their imperial worldview. After one of Clarissa Dalloway's attempts to ingratiate herself goes wrong, for example, Rachel returns almost venge- fully to her music, attacking some Bach, which rises in her mind as a "shape or building," so that she is amazed at "how all these sounds should stand together" (49). Kristeva begins Strangers to Ourselves by proposing Bach's music as a structural model that would enable an escape from hatred of the other through the "harmonious repetition of the differences it implies and spreads." She continues: Bach's compositions evoke to my ears the meaning of an acknowl- edged and harrowing otherness that I should like to be contempo- rary, because it has been brought up, relieved, disseminated, in- scribed in an original play being developed, without goal, without boundary, without end. An otherness barely touched upon and that already moves away. (3) Kristeva here seems to be thinking of the invention, repetition, and contrapuntalism characteristic of Bach's compositions, the internal logic of which suggests a potentially infinite development, where dissonances, har- monies, and partial resolutions are all part of a ceaseless and elusive pro- gression. The otherness of Bach seems both inevitable and shocking, a mu- sic that seems to enact its own deconstruction even as it disappears into the beyond. It is tempting to see Kristeva's "harmonious repetition of differences," which Woolf describes in terms of "the rings of water spread from a fallen stone" (214), as related to the affirmative "operatic" model of the maternal voice. The maternal voice continues to haunt the subject, forever just out of reach, glimpsed as abject or sublime, as melodic counterpoint to the pa- ternal word or menacing disruption of the established order. For Rachel Vinrace, however, it is as if the semiotic chora has never been completely sublimated in the first place, as if the maternal voice continues to enclose 52</page><page sequence="20">THE VOYAGE OUT her in a semipermeable acoustic bubble to be invoked or strengthened through music and finally reactivated by the sounds of the jungle and the cry of the other. EXTRICATION Rachel's final movement out, beyond the reach of the paternal word, begins with the journey up-river, continues with the estrangement and abjection of illness, and is completed with her death. Her extrication from the symbolic code is also a movement in, however, an immersion in the unconscious and the disorder of aural and visual hallucination. As she loses consciousness, visitors to her sickbed "gabble unintelligibly" and she falls into a "deep pool of sticky water, which eventually closed over her head," hearing nothing "but a deep booming sound" (322), now completing a still more profound retreat, back into prenatal night and originary oblivion. She is not absorbed into the discursive and epistemological inside of the patri- archal machine, does not learn and grow in the way that the novel initially indicated she would, but remains on the outside of the word and the inside of the protective enclosure cast by the maternal voice, thus allowing Woolf to accomplish analogous gestures of disengagement and reinstatement. The novel has enacted a discreet challenge to the symbolic code, to the mascu- line sentence, releasing what Silverman calls the "force that assails language and meaning" (104). It also reaffirms acoustic affect and rejuvenates "sen- tence melody," those "postposings, preposings, segmentations, displace- ments, repetitions, surges of the intonational curve" (Kristeva, Desire in Lan- guage 192) that constitute the semiotic dynamic. Although there is a renewal of discursive interaction and intelligibility of utterance at the close of the novel, with voices sounding "gratefully in St. John's ear" (353), the encounter with meaning clearly coincides with the collapse of verbalization and the reinstatement of the voice. The cry of the other reclaims the word from paternal law, the alterity of sound enhancing and subverting signification, reimposing melody upon reason. The Voyage Out can therefore be seen as a critique and deconstruction of its own dis- cursive practices, dramatizing its own gradual discoveries of the instability of rhetoric, the hollowness of the colonial enterprise, and the resonance of the maternal voice within the paternal word. 53</page><page sequence="21">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE NOTES 1 Lyotard sees sound and music producing the "being-now-of-the-heard sound"(179). Repetition, he writes, is a problem of time. And music is a problem of time. But also of sono- rous matter. . . . sound, matter itself, is analyzable into its parameters: amplitude, frequency period, duration, resonance. And as we are deal- ing with the vibratory movement of a gas (air), the nature of this move- ment and its propagation also imply a repetition, that of the oscillation of the mobile part ... and ... the rigidity of the sounding apparatus. (153) On the other hand, he argues, nuance and timbre are essentially unrepeatable. 2 Bhabha uses the inside/outside opposition to support the idea of mim- icry as an integral feature of postcolonial culture. 3 Ruotolo argues that Woolf embraces interruption and disjunction and that her fiction explores the tension between a desire for wholeness and an open- ness to dissolution and disruption: "Tolerance for interruption is all but syn- onymous in Woolf with the quality of comprehension itself' (99). 4 In his deconstruction of rhetorical tropes, de Man shows the inherent trans- latability and perpetual motion of metaphorical figures. He also establishes the relationship between grammar and rhetoric, their reciprocity and potential for mutual sabotage (38). 5 Sound pervades and structures Between the Acts perhaps more than any other of Woolf's novels, not only in the registration of natural or mechanized noise and the representation of interrupted and disjointed voices, but also on the level of language itself, where repetition, assonance, onomatopoeia, and free aural association come to the foreground in an unprecedentedly explicit way. 6 Connor traces the development of exosomatic technologies for the trans- mission of the human voice (the telephone, the phonograph) and theorizes about their psychological effect, and their implications for language itself, in terms of the work of Derrida and Kristeva, amongst others. 7 Derrida is suspicious about the effect of hearing one's own voice as a jus- tification for speech's alleged preeminence over writing, but he stresses the im- portance of the "ear of the other" as a disruption of presence, affirming enig- matically that it is "the ear of the other that signs" (36). 1 Spurr provides a very useful analysis and classification of colonial rheto- ric based on the following typical processes: surveillance (of landscapes, interi- ors, bodies), appropriation, aestheticization, classification, debasement (inspired by a horror of the other), negation (the other as absence), affirmation (of the colonizer's values), idealization (of the savage, as in the case of T. E. Lawrence), insubstantialization (seeing the non-Western world in terms of disturbing or enchanting visions "as easily dissolved as they are conjured up" [155]), natu- ralization (nature as a blank space in discourse, awaiting the colonizer's imprint), and eroticization (representing the colonized world as the feminine). I Silverman's critique of Kristeva's theories of the semiotic argues that the idea of the chora aligns femininity with disempowerment and a disabling inte- riority (72-74). 54</page><page sequence="22">THE VOYAGE OUT 10 In Desire in Language, see particularly "The Bounded Text," "Motherhood According to Giovanni Bellini," and "Place Names." 11 Kristeva's descriptions of the experience of abjection in Powers of Horror closely resemble Woolf's "moments of being," particularly as recalled in "A Sketch of the Past" (70).
