<plain_text><page sequence="1">Howard Colvin, Essays In English Architectural History (New Haven and London: Pub- lished for the Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art by Yale University Press, 1999), XIV + 310 pp., 224 illustrations. Pavilions of modem world's fairs often compete for attention by appearing radically innovative. International expositions serve as laboratories for architectural experiment. Similarly, during the mid-sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries temporary props for civic theater often were novel, even audacious. Modeled vaguely on Roman prece- dent, ephemeral triumphal arches erected in urban streets introduced new classic forms to many European cities. Agents of stylistic innovation frequently were commercial organizations. In more cosmopolitan centers alien merchants collectively sponsored public displays to honor visiting dignitaries-Florentines in Antwerp, Genoese in London, for instance. Light wooden and canvas constructions were more akin to stage settings than to practical buildings. Designers were not ordinary builders conditioned to familiar models of local practice. More likely the designers were sophisticated dilettantes or foreign art- ists. Their fanciful street productions, admired by throngs of spectators at public events, served as highly visible models that greatly influenced taste and the course of architec- tural development. It was a small step for a practical builder of the locality to adapt a new classical motif such as the triumphal arch to a more substantial structure. Initially in many instances the feature was applied as merely a stylish entrance frontispiece in the novel mode. The remainder of the building may appear to us discordant because it contin-</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 657 ued a generic vernacular idiom. Renaissance buildings that employed a consistent classical language did often not appear in full bloom. More typically, traditional build- ings were embellished with fragments of classical examples. Howard Colvin has considered the role of ephemeral street displays in propagat- ing Renaissance classicism. His essay, "Pompous Entries and English Architecture," relates architectural development to civic ritual-processions and pageants, publicity and propaganda. It is one of eighteen articles selected from scholarship extending over over more than fifty years. Twelve essays consider British architecture of the classical tradition. Another arti- cle of particular interest to classicists is "Herms, Terms and Caryatids in English Ar- chitecture." This study is grounded on the Vitruvian theory that the classical orders resonated with the proportions of the human figure, a notion introduced in the first English architectural treatise (The First and Chief Groundes of Architecture, 1563). Colvin considers with skepticism various propositions about the origin of these forms, clarify- ing the distinction between the anthropomorphic architectural elements, the caryatid, the herm, and the term. Other essays focus on particular English buildings and architects. Particularly intriguing is "The Grand Bridge in Blenheim Park." The massive structure, so despised by the client's wife, was built from the early eighteenth-century design of Sir John Vanbrugh. Those familiar with the context of the project that pitted the Duchess of Marlborough against the architect will appreciate this expansive footnote to the histo- ry of Blenheim Palace. This case study of how a particular project evolved may be of special interest to those who are architecturally oriented. Similarly, the essay "Architect and Client in Georgian England" develops the subject of how important buildings were designed and built at the time. Other essays similarly focus on single projects or on issues of how projects were realized, consider- ing interaction of client and architect as well as the role of the state in design of public projects. Sir Howard Colvin, Emeritus Fellow of St. John's College, Oxford, writes in an engaging albeit erudite manner. Five essays were written for this volume and thirteen were reprinted (three extensively revised). In addition to articles concerned with the classical tradition, one is devoted to medieval architecture and one to the Gothick (sic) Revival. There is a list of the author's principal writings on architectural history, 1945- 1998. As expected from this sort of compilation of articles, its strength derives more from the aggregation of particulars than from an integration thesis. The richly illustrat- ed book is a visual delight as well as a substantial and engrossing read. Paul Malo Professor Emeritus, School of Architecture Syracuse University</page></plain_text>
