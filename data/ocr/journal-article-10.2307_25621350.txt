Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009 Abstract Objectives We hypothesized that intentional weight loss may be associated with development of lymphohematopoi etic cancers, based on observations of immune suppression following weight loss in short-term studies. Methods At the baseline of the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (1994-1998), participants reported information about intentional weight loss episodes in the past 20 years. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) among 81,219 women for asso ciations between past intentional weight loss and risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), leukemia, and multiple myeloma during an average 9.9 years of follow-up. Results The risk of NHL was associated with having lost a large maximum amount of weight (&gt;50 pounds, HR = 1.68, A. J.

NHL risk also varied by the frequency of intentional weight loss; women had increased risk if they lost 50 pounds or more &gt;3 times (HR = 1.97, 95% CI 0.93 4.16; p trend by frequency = 0.09) or 20-49 pounds &gt;3 times (HR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.00-2.40; p trend = 0.05), but there was no risk associated with smaller amounts of weight loss (10-19 pounds &gt;3 times, HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.46 1.33). These associations persisted with adjustment for body mass index at different ages. We observed non-significant associations of similar magnitude for multiple myeloma, but past intentional weight loss episodes were not associated with leukemia.

Furthermore, reduc tion of weight among overweight adults has been shown to improve blood pressure, lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation [5-10], and to reduce diabetes incidence and mortality in high-risk persons [6, 11-13]. Nevertheless, other endpoints may be adversely affected by weight loss. Several studies have reported decreases of immune func tion measures following recent significant weight loss [14-16]. Repeated intentional weight loss has been asso ciated with reduced natural killer cell (NK) cytotoxicity [17], and in the same study, women who had been weight stable (within 10 pounds) for longer than 5 years had greater NK function than those who had been weight stable for less than 1 year. Associations of weight loss and weight cycling with decreased immunity suggest that these factors may pose a risk for immune-related diseases. Lymphohematopoietic cancers are clearly caused by immune dysregulation; these cancers emerge in clinical states of severe immunosup pression such as AIDS and in patients on immunosup pressive therapies (e.g., transplant recipients) [18-20]. However, lifestyle factors which may cause subclinical immune dysregulation?such as weight loss and weight cycling?have not been closely studied as risk factors for lymphohematopoietic cancers. Furthermore, overweight and obesity have been reported as risk factors for lym phohematopoietic cancers in a number of studies [2, 21-30]. Observed associations with body mass index (BMI), while intriguing, could possibly be confounded by underlying associations with historical weight loss and/or weight cycling, which have themselves been associated with weight gain [31-33]. Therefore, examination of intentional weight loss as a risk factor for lymphohematopoietic can cers is warranted. We evaluated the association between past intentional weight loss and the risk of lymphohematopoietic cancers (including non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), leukemias, and multiple myeloma) among 81,219 women who par ticipated in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Obser vational Study (OS). We also evaluated the risk of these cancers in relation to BMI at various ages, and explored potential confounding between historical weight loss and BMI in their associations with lymphohematopoietic cancers. Materials and methods Study population The design of the WHI OS has been published previously [34-36]. The OS includes 93,676 community-dwelling, postmenopausal women enrolled between 1994 and 1998 at 40 clinical centers distributed widely throughout the U.S., including targeted enrollment of minority women. Partici pants in the OS were screened for the WHI clinical trials but were determined to be ineligible or were unwilling to participate, or were recruited through a direct invitation for screening into the OS only. Exposure data collection and coding Participants reported information about past intentional weight loss in a self-administered questionnaire at a screening visit prior to the OS baseline clinic visit. The question read, "Within the last 20 years, when you were not pregnant or sick, did you ever lose 10 pounds or more on purpose?" If the participant's answer was yes, they were directed to report further details including the number of times (categories of 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, &gt;7 times) they lost certain amounts of weight (categories of 10-19, 20-49, and &gt;50 pounds). From these questions we coded a new vari able for the maximum amount of weight lost in any episode during the past 20 years (categories of &lt;10, 10-19, 20-49, and &gt;50 pounds). Anthropometric measures were taken by certified clinic staff at the first screening clinic visit. Weight and height were measured using a calibrated balance beam scale and a wall-mounted stadiometer, respectively, to the nearest 0.1 kg for weight and the nearest 0.1 cm for height. BMI at enrollment was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m2). We additionally computed BMI at ages 18, 35, and 50, based on self reported weight. BMI at ages 18 and 35 were coded using indicator variables for the 3-category World Health Orga nization (WHO) classification (&lt;25, 25-29.9, &gt;30) [37]. BMI at age 50 and at enrollment were coded as indicator variables with four categories based on the WHO classifi cation, but with an extra category for extreme obesity (&lt;25, 25-29.9, 30-34.9, &gt;35). We computed an additional variable from the self reported and measured weight to represent the net weight change from age 35 to enrollment (&gt;10 pound loss, &lt;10 pounds change, 10-19 pound gain, 20-49 pound gain, &gt;50 pound gain). We chose age 35 and enrollment in computing net weight change to roughly correspond to the time frame reported in the questions about intentional weight loss episodes (past 20 years). The average age at enrollment was 63.4 years (median = 63); therefore, the net weight change Springer</page><page sequence="3">Cancer Causes Control (2010) 21:223-236 225 variable, on average, represents net change over the past 28 years. Disease outcome ascertainment Women were mailed questionnaires annually to report a wide variety of outcomes including cancers of any type. Partici pants ' reports of incident cancers were recorded and con firmed by trained cancer coders based upon obtained patient medical records. Patient charts were reviewed by a trained coder from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) program to classify the case morphology according to the ICD-O-3 coding [38] into broad categories including NHL, leukemia, and multiple myeloma (including 1 plas macytoma case). To investigate subtype-specific risks, neoplasms were further classified based on the WHO and the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph) guidelines [39, 40]. B cell malignancies were classified as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), fol licular lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma/ chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL). We also studied specific associations with myeloid cell leukemia. We studied outcomes with at least 70 cases, and numbers were too small to study additional or more specific subtypes (e.g., marginal zone lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, etc.). Cases that could not be confirmed in the medical record review were excluded from statistical analyses (n = 3). Women were excluded from analyses if they had no follow up (n = 512) or less than 1 year of follow-up (n = 257). Because our primary interest was in weight loss preceding disease, we excluded cohort members reporting previous cancer diagnoses (except non-melanoma skin cancer) at the study baseline (n = 11,647 cohort members). We also excluded lymphohematopoietic cancer cases occurring during the first year of follow-up to ensure that any asso ciations we observed were not attributable to weight loss from existing, but as-yet-undiagnosed incident disease (n = 38 cases). After exclusions, our study population included 81,219 women. Statistical analysis All analyses were performed using the SAS system, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Associations between weight history characteristics and lymphohematopoietic cancer incidence were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression, and were presented as adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The timing of an incident lymphohematopoietic cancer was defined as the number of days from study enrollment to the first postenrollment diagnosis of the cancer. The follow-up time was otherwise censored at the time of the last documented follow-up contact, death, or 15 August 2008 (whichever came first). The average participant follow-up time in this study was 9.9 years, with a maximum of 13.8 years as of the end of follow-up. To verify the proportional hazards assumption, we tested interactions of the weight history variables and covariates with the time variable. None of the interaction terms in these models was significant, indicating that the assumption of proportionality was satisfied. Each intentional weight loss characteristic (maximum amount of weight lost, frequency of weight loss of different amounts) was modeled separately with each disease out come. Tests for trend were performed by modeling a con tinuous variable coded as the lower-bound values of the categories for each intentional weight loss characteristic; for example, the trend variable values for the maximum weight loss amount were 0,10,20, and 50 pounds. A set of covariates was selected a priori for adjustment of potential confounding, including age at screening (50-59, 60-69, 70-80), race (white, non-white), education (&lt;high school, high school degree/GED, education beyond high school), U.S. region (Northeast, South, Midwest, West), smoking (never smoked, past smoker, current smoker), and BMI at enrollment. Additional potential confounders were selected empirically if they were associated (p &lt; 0.05) with at least one lymphoh ematopoietic cancer outcome and with intentional weight loss (ever lost &gt; 10 pounds in the past 20 years), according to the Wald p value from a regression model that also included age. A complete list of variables screened using this method is shown in Appendix 1, and includes lifestyle (alcohol, smoking, physical activity), diet, psychosocial measures, medications, and medical history-related factors. Potential confounders selected through the empirical method were physical activity (MET hours/week), waist circumfer ence (cm), hip circumference (cm), negative life events (none, 1,2, &gt;2 events), social strain score, breast fed as a baby (yes/no), salicylate use (yes/no current use), antihistamine use (yes/no current use), estrogen + progesterone usage status (never/past/current use), and dietary intake in the last 3 months (each in quartiles) of fruits (no juice), total fat, polyunsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, total carbohydrates, starch, and sugars. We evaluated the importance of these empirically selected potential confounders by comparing results from models that included all of the a priori and empirically selected covariates to models including the a priori covariates only?in terms of change in risk estimates and interpretation. There were no important differences between results using the two sets of covariates; therefore, we only present results from models including the a priori covariates. Because of previous observations of overweight and obesity as risk factors for lymphohematopoietic cancers [2, 21-30], we examined associations of BMI at enrollment and ages 18, 35, and 50 with the lymphohematopoietic cancer outcomes in models including the other a priori to Springer</page><page sequence="4">226 Cancer Causes Control (2010) 21:223-236 covariates. We tested trend using a continuous variable with values equal to the median BMI value in each category. In addition, we evaluated the degree to which BMI variables confounded the intentional weight loss-lymphohematopoi etic cancer associations?and vice versa?by simultaneous modeling of each combination of these variables. We further assessed associations between intentional weight loss and lymphohematopoietic cancers within categories of enroll ment BMI, and evaluated effect modification in a formal test of multiplicative interaction. We evaluated net weight change between age 35 and WHI enrollment as an independent risk factor for each lymphohematopoietic cancer outcome with adjustment for the a priori covariates, and tested trend by modeling a continuous variable with values for the variable cutpoints (-10, 0, 10, 20, and 50). It is important to note that the reference group for our analysis of intentional weight loss episodes consisted of women who did not ever intentionally lose at least 10 pounds in the past 20 years, and therefore included weight-stable women in addition to women who had only gained weight during the past 20 years. Therefore, we also examined potential confounding between inten tional weight loss episodes and net weight change. Results 624 total cases of incident lymphohematopoietic cancer occurred by the end of follow-up (412 NHL, 180 leukemia, 92 multiple myeloma), after exclusion of cases diagnosed during the first year after enrollment.

Approximately half of the women had never smoked. More than half of the women (58.9%) were categorized as overweight or obese, similar to frequencies reported previously in national studies including women ages 50 and older [41, 42]. Participants who developed lymphohematopoietic cancer during the follow up were significantly older than the entire cohort, and NHL cases were more likely than the entire cohort to be white and from the northeast U.S. The other a priori covariates did not differ importantly between the entire cohort and the main lym phohematopoietic cancer case groups. A majority of the women (53.9%) had intentionally lost at least 10 pounds at some time during the past 20 years (Table 2). Women with a history of past intentional weight loss were more likely to be younger, white, past smokers, and overweight or obese than those who did not ever intentionally lose at least 10 pounds in the past 20 years. For intentional weight loss in the past 20 years (Table 3), having lost 50 or more pounds (versus no weight loss &gt; 10 pounds) was associated with increased risk of NHL (HR = 1.68,95% CI 1.13-2.50), and there was a significant trend of increasing risk by categories of increasing maximum weight loss amount (p &lt; 0.01). The risk of multiple mye loma followed a similar pattern as NHL risk for the associ ation with maximum weight loss amount, although the results were not statistically significant due to small numbers of cases (lost &gt; 50 pounds vs. no weight loss: HR = 1.72, 95% CI 0.70-4.23). Risks also appeared to vary by frequency of weight loss. Compared to women with no intentional weight loss episode in the past 20 years, women with intentional weight loss were at increased risk of NHL if they lost 50 pounds or more 1-2 times (HR = 1.56,95% CI 1.02 2.38) or at least 3 times (HR = 1.97, 95% CI 0.93-4.16; p trend by frequency = 0.09), or 20-49 pounds at least 3 times (HR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.00-2.40; p trend = 0.05). There was no apparent NHL risk associated with intentional weight loss of 10-19 pounds, even if multiple times.

Leukemia was not associated with intentional weight loss of any amount, even when it occurred frequently. There were no apparent associations between BMI at enrollment or age 50 and risk of NHL or multiple myeloma (Table 4). Risks associated with BMI at younger ages (18 and 35) were difficult to evaluate because of smaller num bers of overweight and obese women at these ages. Being overweight when compared to normal weight at age 18 was associated with approximately 40% increased risk of NHL; there was no association with obesity at age 18, based on five cases. Extreme obesity (BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2) when compared to normal weight at age 50 was associated with over 2-fold increased risk of leukemia, and there was also a non-sig nificant 50% increased risk of leukemia associated with extreme obesity at enrollment. Associations between obesity and leukemia were less apparent based on ages 18 and 35, although risk estimates were slightly elevated. The results for BMI did not differ substantially with adjustment for maximum amount of intentional weight loss in the past 20 years, although in some cases risk estimates changed by more than 10% (e.g., risk estimate for BMI 25 to &lt;30 at age 18 in relation to NHL: without adjustment, HR = 1.41; with adjustment, HR = 1.27). Observed associations between intentional weight loss variables and lymphohematopoietic cancers persisted with adjustment for BMI, either when assessed at specific ages (e.g., BMI at enrollment) or simultaneously at multiple ages (BMI ages 18, 35, and 50 in same model). For example, the observed associations with NHL were somewhat strengthened upon simultaneous adjustment for BMI at the three ages, for maximum inten tional weight loss amount of 50 or more pounds (HR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.24-2.78; p trend &lt; 0.01), lost 50 pounds or more at least 3 times (HR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.01^.54; p trend = 0.04), and lost 20-49 pounds at least 3 times (HR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.09-2.59; p trend = 0.01). The numbers of exposed cases were sparse in tests for multiplicative interaction for the intentional weight loss variables with enrollment BMI categories; however, these models showed no evidence of effect modification. Despite the high frequency of intentional weight loss episodes in the past 20 years, most women had a net gain in weight between age 35 and at enrollment (an average of 28 years), shown in Table 4.

Net weight change did not confound the associations we observed between intentional weight loss episodes and NHL/myeloma. Estimates for the lymphohematopoietic cancer subtypes were based on small numbers and are presented primarily for descriptive purposes (Table 5). Of the B cell lym phohematopoietic cancer subtypes, the risk of DLBCL was associated with intentional weight loss of at least 50 pounds 3 or more times in the past 20 years (HR = 2.74, 95% CI 1.01-7.43), and non-signiflcantly elevated with weight loss of 20-49 pounds 3 or more times (HR = 1.43, 95% CI 0.70-2.95); however, there were no apparent trends across increasing 'risk' categories. None of the risk esti mates for intentional weight loss in the past 20 years was substantially elevated for follicular lymphoma, SLL/CLL, or myeloid leukemia. We observed elevated risk estimates for DLBCL associ ated with extreme obesity at age 50 (HR = 1.77, 95% CI 0.71-4.44) and at enrollment (HR = 1.76,95% CI 0.95 3.24), and there was a significant trend of increasing DLBCL risk with increasing enrollment BMI (p = 0.04) (Table 6). We also observed a pattern of increasing risk of DLBCL with increasing BMI at age 35, although neither the risk estimates nor trend were statistically significant. These associations between BMI and DLBCL were slightly attenuated with adjustment for maximum intentional weight loss amount; for example, for extreme obesity at age 50 (HR = 1.55,95% CI 0.59-4.09) and at enrollment (HR = 1.61, 95% CI 0.82 3.17; p trend = 0.15). However, the observed (significant and non-significant) associations between DLBCL and the intentional weight loss variables persisted with adjustment for BMI at different ages.

There were no other apparent increases in risk of follicular lymphoma or SLL/CLL for being overweight or obese at different ages. There were notable increases in risk of myeloid leukemia with obesity at age 50 (for BMI 30 to &lt;35: HR = 1.72, 95% CI 0.80-3.70; BMI &gt; 35: HR = 2.58, 95% CI 1.00-6.64; p trend = 0.07) and at enrollment (for BMI &gt; 35: HR = 2.14,95% CI 1.10-4.16), which persisted with adjustment for maximum amount of intentional weight loss. Risk of myeloid leukemia was also non-significantly elevated for overweight versus normal weight at ages 18 and 35, with increases of 37 and 64%, respectively; there was only one myeloid leukemia case in the obese category of BMI at ages 18 and 35. Net weight loss from age 35 to enrollment was associ ated with somewhat elevated risks (44-54%) of DLBCL and SLL/CLL (Table 6), but these results were not statis tically significant. We also observed non-significant ele vated risks of DLBCL (31-43%) for net gains of 20-49 and &gt;50 pounds. There were no increased risks of the other B cell subtypes or myeloid leukemia with net weight gain. Conversely, we observed significantly decreased risks of follicular lymphoma (47-56%) with net weight gains of 10-19 and 20-49 pounds. Net weight change did not confound the associations we observed between intentional weight loss episodes and DLBCL. Discussion In this study of past intentional weight loss as a newly hypothesized risk factor for lymphohematopoietic cancers, we found that a large amount of weight loss (50 or more pounds) in at least one episode during the past 20 years was associated with increased risk of developing NHL, and there was a significant trend of increasing NHL risk with increasing maximum amount of weight loss. We also found that the increased risk of NHL associated with intentional weight loss was greater if women had at least three weight loss episodes in the past 20 years, in amounts of 20-49 pounds or 50 or more pounds. Acknowledging that these findings are preliminary, their potential importance for lymphoma risk relates to the high prevalence of repeated efforts at weight loss among overweight women. Up to 50% of women in Western coun tries are currently attempting or have recently undertaken a weight loss attempt [43,44]?many because of weight regain following previous weight loss [32,45-47]. In our study, the frequency of intentional weight loss (&gt; 10 pounds) in the past 20 years was greater than 50%. In a broader public health context, any increased risk of NHL relating to our findings should be considered in parallel with known benefits of weight loss. The magnitude of potential weight loss benefits is illustrated in an observational study in which gastric surgery patients, who lost an average of 44.3 pounds and a maximum of 68.6 pounds, had 83% lower risk of developing diabetes over an 8-year follow-up period, compared to matched, obese controls whose weight did not significantly change [48]. Nevertheless, taken outside of the broader picture of health risks and benefits, our results in conjunction with further research on health risks and biologic changes from intentional weight loss episodes provide an opportunity to expand understanding of NHL etiology. Obesity has been associated with increased risk of lym phohematopoietic cancers in several studies [2, 21-30], although the relationships have varied by subtype. Weight cycling may lead to net weight gain [31-33]; thus previous associations between obesity and lymphomas could be confounded by historical episodes of weight loss. Ours is the first study of lymphohematopoietic cancers to simulta neously evaluate the effects of both BMI and past weight loss episodes. Women in our study population who had inten tionally lost at least 10 pounds at any time in the past 20 years tended to have higher BMI at the time of WHI enrollment. Additionally, despite the high proportion of women in our study reporting intentional weight loss epi sodes in the past 20 years (&gt;50%), 96% of women had no net change in weight (&lt;10 lbs change) or had net weight gain from age 35 to enrollment. The time periods differ somewhat between the variables for intentional weight loss episodes (past 20 years at enrollment) and net weight change (average of 28 years from age 35 to enrollment); however, these data suggest that most of the women had regained the weight they lost in the past episodes reported?and had in fact ultimately gained more weight than they had lost. In our analysis, weight loss history variables indicating large amounts (20-49 or &gt;50 pounds) of intentional weight loss and frequent (&gt;3 times) intentional weight loss in the past 20 years were significantly associated with risk of NHL (with all subtypes combined) whereas BMI was not, except for a non-monotonic pattern of association at age 18. Results of previous studies for the association between BMI and NHL have been very inconsistent [24, 49]; therefore, our findings for BMI are not in disagree ment. Associations were more complex and unstable for the NHL subtypes we evaluated. For example, we observed increased risk of DLBCL with increasing BMI, similar to other individual studies [50-53] and pooled/meta-analyses [54, 55]. The risk estimates we observed for BMI and DLBCL were somewhat attenuated with adjustment for maximum amount of past intentional weight loss. We also observed elevated risk estimates for DLBCL in relation to frequent weight loss of large amounts, which persisted with adjustment for BMI at different ages. These results are based on a relatively small number of cases (n = 134); however, they suggest that one correlate of obesity which to Springer</page><page sequence="11">Cancer Causes Control (2010) 21:223-236 233 may contribute to DLBCL risk is intentional weight loss. We found different risk patterns for leukemia than for NHL in our study. BMI in the overweight and obese categories at different ages was associated with increased risk of leu kemia, and specifically myeloid leukemia?in agreement with a recent meta-analysis of cohort studies [56]. How ever, we found no association between past intentional weight loss episodes or net weight gain and risk of leu kemia or myeloid leukemia, suggesting that any effect of obesity on leukemia risk may result from the biologic milieu of obesity, rather than from weight change, per se. These results are admittedly very preliminary; however, they illustrate the complex facets of weight change during adulthood that should be studied in greater depth to understand the importance of overweight/obesity in cancer etiology, and that different aspects of weight change and/or obesity may be important for different types of cancer. We did not observe any association between multiple myeloma and BMI at different ages, in contrast to fairly consistent reports in other studies [57]. This may be due to the fact that our sample of myeloma cases was too small (n = 92 cases), or alternatively because there may be no true association (not all previous studies found an association [53]); regardless, further research on BMI and weight history should be conducted as statistical power for studying multiple myeloma in the WHI cohort increases. The potential biologic mechanisms by which weight loss episodes may lead to NHL are unknown; however, we developed the hypothesis based on the fact that weight loss has been associated with decreased immunity. Recent weight loss has been shown in clinical trials to decrease circulating NK cells and serum concentrations of immuno globulins, and lower lymphocyte proliferation [15, 16, 58], and repeated intentional weight loss has been associated with reduced NK cytotoxicity in a small cross-sectional study [17]. If weight loss leads to immune suppression, this could possibly result in impaired ability to combat infec tion with, or reactivation of oncogenic viruses [20]. Reg ulation of viral infection may be a particularly important mechanism for preventing B cell lymphomas, which are known to be caused by viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) when arising in states of severe immune suppression (such as transplant recipients) [20]. There are other phys iologic changes that occur from weight loss, including alteration of lipid profiles [5, 59], increased insulin sensi tivity [7], and a reduction in inflammatory markers [8-10]. The potential biologic importance of these pathways in NHL development is not clear; however, these biologic changes are generally thought to be beneficial for health. For example, reduced inflammation has been hypothesized to decrease the risk of certain obesity-related cancers [60], contrary to our finding of increased risk of NHL associated with intentional weight loss episodes. Shortcomings of our analysis may have obscured true dose-response relations or may have resulted in false positive findings. Although the questions in our study asked about weight loss episodes "when you were not pregnant or sick", and which occurred "on purpose", it is nevertheless possible that weight loss episodes may have unknowingly resulted from illnesses. We aimed to address this issue by excluding participants with any cancer prior to the study baseline or who developed lymphohematopoietic cancer within the first year of follow-up, and by exploring potential confounding by preexisting conditions that could cause involuntary weight loss (e.g., diabetes, autoimmune diseases); the associations we observed were robust to these adjustments and exclusions. Nevertheless, the par ticipants who lost weight may have had other, as yet undiagnosed conditions that caused weight loss as well as development of lymphomas. For example, weight loss is a clinical feature of uncontrolled type-2 diabetes, and type-2 diabetes has also been associated with increased risk of NHL and multiple myeloma [61, 62]. However, such symptoms would have likely led to a diabetes diagnosis prior to enrollment in the WHI. The intentional weight loss variables we studied are fairly simplistic in that they do not include information about the weight loss method (e.g., diet, exercise, medi cations, or surgery), nutritional adequacy during the weight loss episode, rate of weight loss, or changes in body composition (e.g., amount of fat loss vs. lean body mass). Our intentional weight loss variables also did not include information about whether past weight loss was sustained over time, or when and how quickly weight was regained. While intentional weight loss (in the past 20 years) in combination with no net weight change or a net gain (between age 35 and enrollment) in our study may imply weight cycling, we did not have information on weight cycling, per se; therefore, we cannot comment on the risks associated with sustained weight loss versus weight cycling. Distinguishing between the two is important because weight regain is associated with greater fat mass/ lean mass ratio [63]. Similarly, BMI as a construct to describe overweight/obesity is limited and does not capture many potentially important aspects of obesity, including the degree of adiposity or central adiposity. BMI in the setting of low adipose/lean mass ratio also may not cor relate with insulin, insulin resistance, insulin-like growth factor, or other biologic factors hypothesized as potential mediators of carcinogenesis resulting from obesity [64, 65]. Further research in studies with detailed information on the amount, frequency, and timing of intentional weight loss episodes, weight loss method, weight regain, and changes in body composition (including measures of adiposity) over time would be necessary to clarify whether weight loss is an important risk factor for NHL. Springer</page><page sequence="12">234 Cancer Causes Control (2010) 21:223-236 Another concern is that there may be unmeasured con founders responsible for the associations we observed. In the WHI OS we had access to and screened a large number of variables that we considered potential confounders (Appendix 1). While many of the screened variables were associated with having had at least one intentional weight loss episode in the past 20 years, few variables were asso ciated with any of the lymphohematopoietic disease out comes we studied. However, the nature of intentional weight loss is complex and is certainly unlikely to be fully conveyed by the covariates we screened. In particular, social and behavioral factors, dietary patterns, and physical activity are likely to be importantly associated with intentional weight loss and could be related to lymphohematopoietic cancers in more complex variable constructs than those we examined. Therefore, we cannot conclude that any associations we observed are due to biological changes from intentional weight loss versus potentially confounding contributors and/ or consequences of weight loss. This is an obvious issue for deeper examination in future studies. Our study suggests that a large maximum amount of past intentional weight loss and frequent intentional weight loss of 20 pounds or more may lead to increased risk of NHL. The prospective nature of our study strengthens the credibility of our findings. These results call for a more complex assess ment of BMI, weight loss, and weight cycling that incor porates greater detail about both intentional weight loss episodes and intentional/non-intentional weight change over time, in addition to correlates of weight loss/weight cycling. Our results also suggest that BMI should be evaluated as a potential risk factor for NHL only in studies that additionally examine historical changes in weight and/or body compo sition. Further research into the short- and long-term bio logic effects of weight loss and weight cycling may support existing data suggesting an etiologic mechanism related to immune suppression.
