Ray Buckendale Lectures, inaugurated in 1954, commemorate the contributions of the 1946 SAE Pres- ident as a developer of the latent abilities of young men and as an authority in the theory and practice of gearing, particularly as applied to automotive vehicles. A cash award and certificate are provided for an an- nual lecture and monograph by a distinguished authority in the technical areas of commercial or military ground vehicles for either on- or off-road operation. The Lectures are directed toward filling the needs of young engineers and students for up-to-date practical knowledge. THE DIESEL ENGINE FOR TRUCK APPLICATION Because of its outstanding fuel economy and its somewhat lower maintenance costs, the diesel engine has become dominant in the transportation field, especially for heavy-duty trucks. There is evidence that use of diesel engines in medium- and light-duty trucks as well as in passenger cars will increase in the future. Most diesel engines are in- stalled in commercial vehicles. However if the engine is not carefully matched to the transmission and accessories, as well as to the specific vehicle application (severity of duty), the total package may be commercially unattractive. The purpose of this paper is to detail the most important considerations in matching diesel engines with trans- mission, components, etc., for use in commercial vehicles, specifically truck application. The paper surveys the market currently served by diesel engines, gives an overall view of the engine application process, discusses en- gine-transmission-vehicle matching and performance, and details the engine services supplied by the vehicle, such as the provision of cool and clean air, water, oil, and fuel, exhaust removal, engine mounting, temperature control of the engine, coolant flow arrangements, accessories, and cold weather operation. Noise and exhaust emissions are also discussed. PHILIP 8. MYERS MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON Phillip S. Myers was SAE President in 1969, and is currently professor of Mechanical Engineering at University of Wiscon- sin. Myers is ideally suited to the duality of a university career; it fully utilizes his diverse talents. An outstanding educator - he is a recipient of the Benjamin Smith Reynolds Teaching Award- he has inspired many students and young researchers to success in their engineering careers. His re- search into the vagaries of engines and combustion as well as heat transfer during welding is characterized by a uniqueness of thought that is evident in scores of technical papers and many engineering developments. Myers was 26 when, in 1942 he received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Kansas State University. Two years before, he gained a similar degree in mathematics and commerce from McPherson College. Upon transferring to the University of Wisconsin, he taught courses in heat power while pursuing his M.S. and Ph.D. He was appointed a full professor in 1955. Although his primary concern is the student, Myers is an active consultant for several companies and government agencies. SAE recognized Myers* contributions to engineering when he and life-long associate, Otto Uyehara, were presented the 1968 Horning Memorial Award. In 1965, Myers received the Colwell Award. Honors are not unusual to Myers for he is a member of Sigma Xi, Phi Kappa Phi, Pi Tau Sigma, and Tau Beta Pi among others. Since becoming a member of SAE in 1946, Myers has served in all offices of the Milwaukee Section. He is a past-chairman of the Powerplant Activity and, as a member of the Engineering Activity Board, helped start the Engineering Education Activity. He was a member of the Board of Directors and the Objectives Planning Committee. In addition, he chaired the Publications Advisory Committee of the Engineering Activity Board. More recently, Myers has served as an SAE representative on the ECPD Council and is presently Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Conser- vation of Energy and Other Material Resources. 17</page><page sequence="3">HORNING MEMORIAL AWARD The Horning Memorial Award is granted annually to the author of the best paper relating to the adaptation of fuels to internal combustion engines, or the adaptation of internal combustion engines to fuels, which has been pre- sented at a meeting of the Society during the calendar year. Papers are judged primarily for their value as new contributions to existing knowledge of the art of such adaptation. One of Harry L. Homing's deep interests was the es- tablishment of a broadly cooperative agency devoted to the better mutual adaptation through experimental effort of fuels and internal combustion engines, including the development of an internationally recognized standard for testing fuels. He was a major force in the movement to bring the automotive and petroleum industries together to deal with the fuel problem. LEAN COMBUSTION AND THE MISFIRE LIMIT IN SPARK IGNITION ENGINES Low nitric oxide (NO) emissions and good fuel economy are obtainable at very lean mixtures. However, unstable operation caused by misfire and erratic combustion prevents present spark ignition engines from being operated very lean. A study was undertaken to understand what causes very lean mixtures to misfire in engines. The effects of mixture preparation, intake airflow, exhaust gas recirculation (simulated by Ng dilution), compression ratio, intake mixture temperature, engine speed, number of spark plugs and spark plug locations were investigated at minimum advance for best torque (MBT) spark timing in single-cylinder engines. Propane and isooctane were the fuels used. Results showed that leaner operation was possible with improved mixture preparation, increased airflow, de- creased nitrogen (Ng) dilution, increased compression ratio, increased mixture temperature, decreased engine speed, more central spark location, and multiple spark plugs. The dominant factors responsible for these effects were mixture homogeneity, charge dilution, and charge temperature. In most cases, at the lean limit the combus- tion duration (in crank angle degrees) reached a limiting value. The significance of these findings together with the exhaust emission and fuel consumption results are presented and discussed. A. A. GUADER GENERAL MOTORS RESEARCH LABORATORIES Ather A. Quader has been at General Motors Research Laboratories since 1968, and he is presently a Senior Research Engineer in the Fuels and Lubricants Department. Born in Hyderabad, India, he completed his bachelors degree in Me- chanical Engineering at Osmania University in 1962. He con- tinued graduate study at the University of Wisconsin conclud- ing with a doctoral research program focused on UV absor- bance and knock in spark ignition engines. Since joining GMR Dr. Quader has continued basic research in combustion, con- centrating on nitric oxide formation and control in internal combustion engines. His past efforts have contributed to a better understanding of intake charge dilution and spark plug location effects on emissions and fuel consumption in engines. His current research interests include the mechanism of ignition, flame propagation in lean mixtures and combustion limits in engines. 18</page><page sequence="4">MANLY MEMORIAL MEDAL The Manly Memorial Medal is awarded annually to the author of the best paper relating to the theory or practice in the design or construction of, or research on, aerospace engines, their parts, components, or ac- cessories. Eligible are papers presented before SAE national and section meetings. Papers are judged for their value as a contribution to the knowledge of the aerospace art. They are not judged upon the value of any mechanical development or invention already known that may be described in the paper. The Award is given in memory of Charles Matthews Manly as a tribute to the many contributions he made in the fields of automotive and aeronautic engineering. Es- tablished in 1928, the scope of the award was broadened in 1960 to include advances in the aerospace field. QUASI-THREE-DIMENSIONAL FLOW SOLUTION BY MERIDIONAL PLANE ANALYSIS A computer program has been developed to obtain subsonic or shock-free transonic, nonviscous flow analysis on the hub-shroud midchannel flow surface of a turbomachine. The analysis may be for any annular passage, with or without blades. The blades may be fixed or rotating and may be twisted and leaned. The flow may be axial, radial, or mixed. Blade surface velocities over the entire blade are approximated, based on the rate of change of angular momen- tum. This gives a three-dimensional flow picture based on a two-dimensional analysis. This paper discusses the method used for the program and shows examples of the type of passages and blade rows which can be analyzed. Also, some numerical examples are given to show how the program can be used for practical assistance in design of blading, annular passages, and annular diffusers. THEODORE KATSANIS AND WILLIAM D.

The scope of the Award was broadened in 1961 to include papers relating to advances in the field of space flight. Papers are judged primarily for their value as new contributions to existing knowledge of the aeronautic and/or space art. The Dayton Section of SAE originated the idea of awarding a Wright Brothers Medal in 1924, with the double purpose of honoring the first successful construc- tors and operators of heavier-than-air flying equipment and of encouraging the presentation before the Society of the results of new developments in the form of en- gineering papers. In 1927, at the request of the Dayton Section, the Board of Directors of the Society took over administration of the Award. FLIOHTI PROPULSION CONTROL INTEGRATION ASPECTS OF ENERGY MANAGEMENT Analytical studies indicate substantial aircraft performance benefits can result from proper application of energy management principles, and that conceptual approaches involving close coupling of aerodynamic, propulsion, and control technical elements are required to achieve these benefits. Analytic tools used in these studies include a modified Rutowski technique for simultaneously optimizing throttle position and flight path. Pilot-in-the-loop simu- lation results are presented and the use of advanced pilot displays utilizing energy management techniques are described. Factors affecting the implementation of Flight/ Propulsion Control Integration (FPCI) techniques for energy management are considered. Elements of fly-by-wire control augmentation systems, electronic engine controls, advanced pilot displays, and automatically controlled inlet and nozzle systems in future aircraft designs are dis- cussed. Conclusions about the current technology base are drawn, and recommendations are made concerning future effort in this field and the potential in aircraft maneuverability and performance offered by application of energy management concepts.
