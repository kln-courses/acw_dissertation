<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Miss Smith probably realizes: not only has the church been allegedly guilty of a "schizophren- ic" ideology, but so has our whole capitalist cul- ture been equally culpable. Our author can re- solve her dilemma perhaps by not posing dubi- ous alternatives. It is not a matter of deciding in favor of spiritual regeneration instead of mate- rial welfare as the latter is commonly under- stood. There should rather be two simultaneous movements: one, a philosophy of co-operative brotherhood in all interpersonal relations and, the other, an active support to those agencies engaged in combating the daily problem of in- tolerance and discrimination and to those or- ganizations whose ultimate goal is economic as well as political and social democracy. As Ruth Benedict tersely phrased it, "To understand race conflict we need fundamentally to under- stand conflict and not race." Only a libertarian society freed from economic oligarchies and so- cial stratifications can at least provide the neces- sary, if not the sufficient, conditions for the abolition of all segregations. Among her professional gifts Miss Smith pos- sesses one required of all those engaged in the kind of study which Killers of the Dream repre- sents. "In all physiognomic characterization," observes Kroeber, "one must have the courage of his impressions." Not only does our author have such courage, but she has what is of greater importance: a faith in the ultimate realization of the "dream of freedom and human dignity." GEORGE KIMMELMAN Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Orientation in Religious Education. Edited by PHILIP H. LOTZ. Nashville, Tenn.: Abingdon- Cokesbury Press, I95o. 6I8 pages. $6.5o. This book is a successor to the editor's pre- vious symposium of twenty-nine writers, Studies in Religious Education (I93I). The new volume is an encyclopedic reference work, the product of forty-six contributors, only three of whom wrote for the first edition. They do give a fair picture of religious education as it operates in the United States today, and one chapter gives a few facts about the state of religious education in other countries. Two deal with Jewish and Roman Catholic programs and practices, but the chief attention is directed to middle-of-the- road Protestant evangelical patterns. Not only is the regular Sunday-school work described in its various phases and different age levels, but there are descriptions of vacation and weekday schools of religion, church camps and confer- ences, theological seminary programs of reli- gious education, and work done in both denomi- national and state institutions of higher learn- ing. Little mention is made of denominational systems, but there are chapters on community work, relation to the public school and other agencies, and co-operative activities in city and state councils, the International Council of Re- ligious Education, the Religious Education As- sociation, and the World Council of Religious Education. In general, the conception of religious edu- cation is about the same in all the forty-six writers, a limited and stereotyped point of view. For the most part the assumption is that there is one God for Protestant, Jew, and Roman Catholic and that the end of religious education is to promote faith in him. For the Protestant and Roman Catholic he is revealed primarily in Jesus Christ, and the main source of knowl- edge and inspiration is the Bible. Children, youth, and adults are to be taught from the earliest years to accept the theological mores of their sect or faith, and they are supposed to be- come acquainted with the Bible as it is inter- preted by their particular group. One writer would start with two- and three-year-olds, seek- ing to make them conscious of God and identi- fying the fact of God with all that gives them pleasure and security. There is no recognition of the fact that God is the perennial problem of theologians and phi- losophers, and there is no attempt, or sense of need, to give evidence for the affirmations and claims that are made about God. Even the key- noter in theology, Dr. John C. Bennett, fails to deal with the overwhelming problems of sick- ness, suffering, poverty, war, crime, and the multitude of evils which confront growing per- sons at every turn. Several writers lament the fact that curriculum materials are unsatisfac- tory and that there is no meaningful philosophy underlying them. Though the term "Christian" is continually used in a normative way, several admit that there is no general agreement on what it means and that the difference between general education and Christian education is quite indefinite. It is unfortunate that there is no more con- sideration of basic ideas and that there is no attention to method for developing religious in- sights and values in the light of widening expe- rience and expanding knowledge. A few seem to 292</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL REVIEWS feel that a functional point of view is desirable, if religion is to control all phases of life, but they do not discuss or illustrate how this is to be achieved. Dr. Arlo Brown and others express the fear that, unless "we think through a way of treating religious subjects adequately on an in- terfaith basis in the public school curriculum, the propagandists of atheism and materialism will win the day." But no one among the forty- six writers seems to dare to suggest the radical changes that are needed in basic philosophy and methods. Fears of secularism, atheism, and ma- terialism imply that the Christian religion has not been equal to the challenges of a modern world, that none of the theological gods in its pantheon have been able to control the develop- ing processes. Perhaps the orthodox concepts rest too much on rationalizations of prescientific ideas and fail to appreciate the growing under- standings of the spiritual forces at work in all areas of life. Instead of trying to make man fit into theological arguments about God, let re- ligionists use the growing knowledge of how personality develops and how social forces operate; and let appreciations of the "divine" and use of the symbol "God" be with reference to a universe and a life-process that transcends anthropomorphic images. ERNEST J. CHAVE Federated Theological Faculty University of Chicago The Individual and His Religion: A Psychologi- cal Interpretation. By GORDON W. ALLPORT. New York: Macmillan, I950. xi+I47 pages. $2.50. In examining religion in general from the point of view of psychology in general, there has been no book comparable to this since William James. There have been other excellent and original books on aspects of the theme, such as those of Boisen. But we have long needed a vol- ume with the same scope and broad insight as that of James, which yet took adequately into account all the facets of the great developments which have occurred in psychology since his time. No doubt the author would claim only that he has tried to make a small beginning in this direction. It is true that his work is brief and is suggestive rather than exhaustive. But it is so penetrating that it may well stimulate the more detailed work still needed. Modern psychology, to get ahead, had to turn its back upon the altars of religion and for- sake the philosopher's armchair. In accumulat- ing verifiable facts, however, it became "psy- chology without a soul." The author believes "there is inherent absurdity in supposing that psychology and religion, both dealing with the outward reaching of man's mind, must be per- manently and hopelessly at odds." But if a har- mony of effort is to arise, it cannot be through a "narrowly conceived science" or a "narrowly conceived religion." There is, concludes the author, no single form of the "religious sentiment." "It is the habitual and intentional focusing of experience rather than the character of the experience itself that marks the existence of a religious sentiment." Here, as elsewhere, the recent discoveries about the "unconscious" are recognized and included, but the psychological position as a whole is an ego-psychology in the same sense as that of James. There is also much affinity to White- head, for example: "Perhaps the most striking fact about subjective religion is the contrast be- tween its essential simplicity when, well- formed, it is playing its part in the economy of the personal life, and its extreme complexity in the process of forming." With his characteristic skill in definition, Dr. Allport sees the "mature religious sentiment" as "a disposition, built up through experience, to respond favorably, and in certain habitual ways, to conceptual objects and principles that the in- dividual regards as of ultimate importance in his own life, and as having to do with what he regards as permanent or central in the nature of things." Religion to the individual is "his ulti- mate attempt to enlarge and to complete his own personality by finding the supreme context in which he rightly belongs." A large contribution of the book is its rejec- tion of reductionism and geneticism. "The plain truth is that origins can tell nothing about the validity of a belief." A mature religious senti- ment need feel no inferiority in the face of sci- ence. "Instead of serving as the stale ground from which scientific insights dazzlingly emerge, religion may be perceived as the fresh and sparkling insight needed to supplement and cor- rect the lifeless and de-valued ground of sci- ence." There is an opening chapter on the origins of the religious quest and a useful chapter on the religion of childhood and youth featuring analy- sis of a firsthand study. The religion of maturity, leading to an understanding of the "mature re- 293</page></plain_text>
