STEVENS Center for Desert Archaeology 300 East University Boulevard, Suite 230 Tucson, Arizona 85705 R. JANE SLIVA Desert Archaeology, Inc. 3975 North Tucson Boulevard Tucson, Arizona 85716 ABSTRACT Until recently, San Pedro points were the only temporally diagnostic projectile point style associated with the San Pedro phase of the Early Agricultural period in the southern Southwest. Recent archaeological survey and excavation projects conducted in Cienega Valley and the Tucson Basin have identified the Empire point as an additional projectile point style diagnostic of the San Pedro phase. Comparisons of morphologic and metric attributes of Empire and San Pedro points demonstrate that Empire points are morphologically and metrically distinct from San Pedro points and should be considered a new projectile point style. The spatial and temporal distributions of Empire points, and the cultural impli- cations of this point style and its distributions, are discussed. RESUMEN Hasta hace poco tiempo, puntos de San Pedro eran el dnico estilo temporalmente diagnrstico del punto asociado con lafase de San Pedro del periodo Temprano Agricola en el Suroeste sureho. Proyectos arqueol6gicos recientes del reconocimiento y excavaci6n conducido en el Valle de Cienega y la Cuenca de Tucson han identificado el punto del Empire como un punto adicional estiliza diagn6stico de la fase de San Pedro. Las comparaciones de morfol6gico y atributos metricos del Empire y puntos de San Pedro demuestran eses puntos del Empire son morfol6gicamente y mitricamente distincto de puntos de San Pedro y deben ser considerado un estilo nuevo de puntos. Las distribuciones espaciales y temporales de puntos de Empire, y de las implicaciones culturales de este estilo del punto y sus distribuciones, se discuten. Projectile points are usually the most reliable diagnostic artifacts recovered from Archaic and Early Agricultural period sites in the American Southwest. Many styles have been demonstrated to be temporal indicators and possibly cultural markers for entire periods or phases, such as Jay (Early Archaic in the northern</page><page sequence="2">298 STEVENS AND SLIVA Southwest), Chiricahua (Middle Archaic in the southern Southwest), San Pedro (San Pedro phase of the Early Agricultural period in the southern Southwest), and Cienega (Cienega phase of the Early Agricultural period in the southern Southwest) (e.g., Huckell 1984, 1988, 1990, 1995; Sayles 1983; Sayles and Antevs 1941; Sliva 1999a). Several factors, including point breakage and reworking, raw material properties, regional and temporal variation in execution, and the idiosyncrasies of individual knappers, can combine to result in substantial morphological variation within defined styles (Flenniken and Raymond 1986; Frison 1976). This may result in both inaccurate splitting, when points of the same cultural and temporal affiliation are assigned to separate types, and inaccurate lumping, when researchers assign artifacts of different types to a single temporal or cultural category. The latter case is true of a particular Early Agricultural projectile point type from southern Arizona that frequently has been misidentified and grouped with San Pedro points. We propose that this point, which we have named "Empire," be recognized as a discrete type diagnostic of the early San Pedro phase of the Early Agricultural period in southern Arizona. These points first came to our attention while examining artifacts collected by the Center for Desert Archaeology's (CDA's) Cienega Valley Survey (CVS), con- ducted by Stevens from January 1995 to April 1999 (Stevens 2001). Cienega Creek flows between the Santa Rita and Empire Mountains on the west and the Whet- stone Mountains on the east, approximately 60 km southeast of Tucson, Arizona. Among the San Pedro and Cienega points, we noticed a number of points from six CVS sites that we could not identify to type but assumed were unrelated generic Middle Archaic or Early Agricultural points. A closer examination of these points, however, revealed striking morphological similarities among them, with several- including points from different sites-being nearly identical to each other. This led us to believe that they represented a mental template for a technological style distinct from those of previously defined types in the region and time period. Stevens suggested the name "Empire" after site AZ EE:2:3421 (the Empire Point site) in Empire Gulch, which had yielded the largest assemblage of the points known at the time. We began searching the literature for comparative data demonstrating the existence of these points beyond the Cienega Valley. In 1998, Desert Archaeology, Inc.'s (DAI's) excavations at the San Pedro phase Las Capas site (AZ AA: 12:111) north of Tucson recovered 12 Empire points (Sliva n.d.). Subsequent excavations by SWCA, Inc. in 1999 in the western portion of this site have encountered an exceptional quantity (possibly as many as 40) of the points in various stages of manufacture, providing the strongest evidence yet for the stylistic distinction of the type as well as its temporal affiliation (Lascaux and Hesse 2001). THE EARLY AGRICULTURAL PERIOD The Early Agricultural period, ca. 1700 B.C.-A.D. 50, in the southern Southwest (formerly known as the Late Archaic period), includes cultural groups that continued</page><page sequence="3">Empire Points 299 as mobile hunter-gatherers after 1700 B.C. (Late Archaic) and cultural groups that practiced a less mobile, mixed farming-foraging economy (Early Agricultural) (Huckell 1995; Woodbury 1993:223). Because distinguishing the adaptive strat- egies of Late Archaic and Early Agricultural sites relies upon determining the presence or absence of cultigens, the term Early Agricultural will be used to designate all sites dating to this interval. The Late Archaic designation is used only for excavated sites that are known to lack cultigens. The Early Agricultural period has been subdivided into three phases based on differences in age, projectile points, architectural forms, types of ground stone tools, and marine shell jewelry (Gregory 2001; Huckell 1995; Mabry et al. 1997). These phases include an unnamed interval (1700-1200 B.C.), the San Pedro phase (1200-800 B.C.), and the Cienega phase (800 B.C.-A.D. 50). Unnamed Interval, 1700-1200 B.c. Few sites in southeast Arizona have components dating to the interval between 1700-1200 B.c. (Gregory 1993, 1999; Gregory et al. 2001; Halbirt and Henderson 1993; Mabry 1998a; Stevens 1999). Of these, only the Sweetwater locus at Los Pozos (AZ AA: 12:91) in the Tucson Basin, has an intact 1700-1200 B.C. occupation that has not been subsequently obscured and/or disturbed by later occupations (Gregory et al. 2001). Unfortunately, the features and artifact assemblage at the Sweetwater locus of Los Pozos are not distinctive. The presence of maize and bell- shaped pits indicates that farming and storage of cultigens ocurred. It is not yet clear, however, whether the occupations dating to this interval represent the same suite of material traits found in the San Pedro phase or a phase that has not yet been defined (Gregory 1999; Gregory et al. 2001; Mabry and Stevens 2000; Stevens 1999). San Pedro Phase, 1200-800 B.c. San Pedro phase occupations have been identified throughout the southern South- west (Carmichael 1986; Cosgrove 1947; Dick 1965; Ezell 1954; Ezzo and Deaver 1998; Haury 1950; Huckell 1990; Huckell and Huckell 1984; Huckell et al. 1995; Mabry 1990, 2001; MacNeish 1993; Sayles 1941, 1983; Wellman 2000). San Pedro phase sites typically have San Pedro points, oval and round pit structures, carbonized maize remains, limited types of ground stone tools and marine shell ornaments, and occasionally fired-clay anthropomorphic figurines. Recent investigations in the Tucson Basin also indicate that early pottery (Mabry 2001; Lascaux and Hesse 2001), a cemetery (Mabry 2001), and water control features such as ditches (Ezzo and Deaver 1998) and canal systems (Mabry 2001), occur during the San Pedro phase. Based on the stratigraphy at the Las Capas site in the Tucson Basin, the San Pedro phase can be divided into early (ca. 120(-1000 B.C.) and late (ca. 1000-800 B.C.) subphases (Mabry 2001).</page><page sequence="4">300 STEVENS AND SLIVA The combination of abundant and ubiquitous carbonized maize remains and water control technology at San Pedro phase sites (Ezzo and Deaver 1998; Mabry 2001) indicates that agriculture was an important component of San Pedro phase subsistence strategies. The absence of cultigens at the Coffee Camp site (Halbirt and Henderson 1993), however, may indicate that some groups continued as mobile foragers. Alternatively, such sites may represent seasonal or limited activity sites, and cultigens may have been used by the same group at other sites. Cienega Phase, 800 B.C.-A.D. 50 The Cienega phase has been divided into early (800-400 B.c.) and late (400 B.C.--A.D. 50) intervals based on seriations of architecture and other types of material culture (Gregory 1996, 1999) and currently available radiocarbon dates (Gregory 1996, 1999; Mabry 1998b). Based on general differences in lithic assemblages, Sliva has shown that during the late Cienega phase less game may have been processed but there was a greater diversity of activities conducted at sites than during the early Cienega phase (Sliva 1999b). In the Tucson Basin and Cienega Valley, Cienega phase sites typically have Cienega points, numerous round pithouses, high artifact densities, new and diverse types of ground stone and shell assemblages, abundant evidence of cultigens, large intramural and extramural storage pits, small numbers of pottery sherds, and more burials than are found in San Pedro phase sites (Diehl 1996, 1997; Freeman 1998; Gregory 1999; Heidke 1999; Huckell 1995, 1996; Mabry 1998c; Mabry and Archer 1997; Swartz and Lindeman 1997; Thiel 1995a, 1995b). Although settlement locations and many aspects of material culture indicate continuity between the San Pedro and Cienega complexes, some technologies, material culture traits, and customs appear for the first time in the Cienega phase. These include 1) Cienega points (triangular points with deep comer notches), many of which may have been used as arrowheads indicating a technological advance in hunting (Sliva 1999a), 2) new types of ground stone vessels, and 3) evidence for deliberate homicide (Freeman 1998). The variety of domestic and storage pit struc- tures with numerous floor pits, house groups, plazas, and cemeteries suggests increased reliance on stored foods and commitment to settled, village life, at least seasonally. Water control features such as canals at the Santa Cruz Bend site (Mabry 1998b) and wells at Los Pozos (Gregory 1999, 2001) and Los Morteros (Bernard- Shaw 1989) indicate the continued exploitation and manipulation of rivers and groundwater. SAN PEDRO PHASE POINT STYLES Despite their distinctive morphological attributes, Empire points have often been identified as San Pedro or "possible" San Pedro points (Downum et al. 1986: Figure 4.5h; Huckell 1984:Figure 5.23h, i; Huckell et al. 1995:Figure 3.1d;</page><page sequence="5">Empire Points 301 Lancaster 1993:Figure 3.7, Spec. 1384, Figure 3.8, Spec. 1433). This is probably due to the small number of San Pedro phase sites excavated and the rarity of Empire points in Cienega phase assemblages; single Empire points recovered among numerous San Pedro points have usually been considered anomalous indi- vidual variants of the San Pedro style. However, recent survey data from the Cienega Valley (Stevens 2001) and excavation data from the northern Tucson Basin (Sliva n.d.) indicate that, far from representing individual knappers' quirky interpretations of the San Pedro template, Empire points are both a distinct type and a temporal horizon marker. San Pedro Points The San Pedro style (Figure 1) was initially defined by Sayles as diagnostic of the latest stage of the Cochise Culture (Sayles and Antevs 1941; Sayles 1983:Figure 10.4a and b). These points first appeared during the eponymous San Pedro phase of the Early Agricultural period in southern Arizona, and continued through the Agua Caliente phase of the Early Ceramic period (A.D. 50-550). They are common at Early Agricultural sites across western, central, and southern Arizona, and north- ern Sonora, Mexico (Haury 1950; Huckell et al. 1995; Lancaster 1993; Sayles 1983; Shackley 1996; Sliva 1997, 1998a, 1998b, 2001). They appear to have been used (and, likely, still manufactured) through the initial portion of the Early Ceramic period in southern Arizona, and in fact represent the majority of the points recovered from the Agua Caliente phase Houghton Road site (AZ BB:13:398; Huckell 1998). Some San Pedro points recovered from late Cienega phase and later contexts exhibit wear traces suggesting use as hafted knives, although whether this represents their intended primary function or secondary use cannot be deter- mined (Sliva 2001:96, n.d.). San Pedro points were manufactured through a combination of percussion and pressure flaking. They have long triangular blades with straight to excurvate edges, wide necks, and expanding stems with straight to convex bases (Figure 1). Blade edges are generally slightly excurvate and only rarely serrated. When serrations occur, the edges are usually prominently toothed. Distinctive c-shaped to ear-shaped notches are located low on the sides or comers of the points, and the shoulders range from square to barbed. Shackley (1996) published the first widely disseminated study of San Pedro metric attributes in an attempt to demonstrate methods of distinguishing them from Elko Corner-notched points, but his sample was small (n = 6) and limited to the Tank Mountains of western Arizona. In addition, the discrimination between San Pedro and Elko points in that sample is suspect in some cases2. The metric and morphological data presented here (Tables 1-2) are derived from a study sample numbering 175 San Pedro points recovered from sites throughout Arizona. The style encompasses a substantial range of morphological variation, although this</page><page sequence="6">302 STEVENS AND SLIVA a b c d e f Scale: 0 1 2 cm Figure 1.

Variation among individual points is generally visually discernible as differences in overall size, blade shape, blade size, notch shape, and notch depth. From a measurement standpoint, these overall shape differences are largely due to variation in blade length and width. These two dimensions exhibit the greatest amount of variation in the sample, whereas stem dimensions are more standardized. The blade differ- ences thus produce the overall shape differences visible as variation in blade-to- stem length ratios, blade-to-base width ratios, and degree of neck contraction. Empire Points A crucial step in describing Empire points is to discuss why they are not San Pedro points. In contrast to the wide blades and side/corner-notched stems of the San Pedro style, Empire points have long, relatively narrow triangular blades and straight stems that are only slightly narrower than the blade (Figure 2). Finished with pressure flaking, the blades are frequently finely serrated and the shoulders are generally rounded. The blades on some specimens thicken toward the tip, occasionally ap- proaching diamond-shaped cross sections. Empire points are stemmed rather than truly side-notched, although a few examples of eared bases are known, and the stem edges and base may be ground. Bases are overwhelmingly straight to slightly convex3. They are frequently finished with distinctive, if rather crude, steep faceting that contrasts with the more careful basal thinning usually found on San Pedro points. The hafting element was likely the last portion of the point to be finished by the knapper, as suggested by blanks with Empire-like blades (sometimes including serrations) but unfinished bases. We identified 11 such blanks from the site of La Playa in Sonora, Mexico (SON F:10:3) in the Arizona State Museum collections, and several others are known from the SWCA, Inc. excavations at Las Capas (India Hesse, personal communication, 2001). Metric data for all finished Empire points used in this study are presented in Tables 1-2; measurements were taken directly on points recovered though DAI/CDA excavations and survey, as well as specimens from other projects in southern and east-central Arizona and northern Sonora curated at the Arizona State Museum (see Table 3). Figure 2 shows Empire points recovered from the CDA's CVS in the Cienega Valley and DAI excavations at Las Capas. Some of the fragmentary specimens (e.g., Figure 2p, 2w) might seem nondiagnostic at first glance, but to the trained eye their shapes and the nature of their serrations are sufficiently distinctive to merit inclusion with the complete and stem-only examples of the type. Archetypal examples of San Pedro and Empire styles, derived from data recorded in DAI and CDA databases, and the locations of measurements taken on these point styles are illustrated in Figures 3-4. Both styles exhibit a relatively limited range of variation of metric attributes, with average values for most of the measured dimensions differing between the two types by less than 1 mm.

Blade length exhibits the greatest variation for both styles, but is also the dimension most likely to be affected by breakage and repair and thus is not a reliable indicator of intentional design difference. Because blade width is affected to a lesser degree by repair than length (Shott 1993:434-435, 1997:94; Thomas 1981:14-15), it is retained as a valid discriminator between the two styles. A Mann-Whitney U-test was conducted to verify that the blade and basal widths of Empire and San Pedro points are demonstrably different. Utilizing a signifi- cance level of .05, the differences between the two populations were found to be significant (Mann-Whitney U for blade width = 7912.5, probability = 0.000; U for basal width = 4255.5, probability = 0.000). These differences are best illustrated with notched box plots (Figures 5 and 6). The width differences have a substantial impact on the resultant morphological appearances of the two styles. Table 2 lists ratios between blade width, neck width, and basal width; the morphological impli- cations of these are narrower blades, relatively wider necks, and generally straighter stems for Empire points than for San Pedro ones. Although Empire points are narrower than San Pedro points, both point styles have similar mean blade lengths. This is reflected in the comparatively large blade length to blade width ratios for Empire points. The virtually identical range of blade lengths between the two styles also argues against Empire blade narrowness being the result of reworking San Pedro points; if Empire points are the result of repairing San Pedro points whose blades snapped, Empire blade lengths should be consistently shorter than San Pedro lengths. The fact that they are not, along with the strong morphological consis- tency within the Empire style, makes it very unlikely that Empire points are reworked San Pedro points. Raw Materials The San Pedro and Empire points in the study sample were made from the same basic range of raw materials. Most of these are fine-to medium-grained igneous and metamorphic rocks that were available in the vicinity of the sites where the points were collected. In the Tucson Basin, inhabitants of Early Agricultural sites located in the Santa Cruz floodplain relied heavily upon locally available rhyolites, quartzites, and metasediments for point production. Although these materials are generally not considered to be of equivalent high quality to cryptocrystalline materials such as chert and chalcedony, their flaking properties and resultant edge sharpness and durability made them the stones most frequently chosen for the production of Empire and San Pedro points. Some examples of nonlocal material use are known; these primarily involve San Pedro points made of exotic cryptocrystallines. It is unclear whether this represents the acquisition of raw materials or of finished points because the data set contains incomplete information about debitage raw material.

Spatial Distributions Based on published excavation reports of San Pedro phase sites and regional survey reports in southern Arizona and on examination of curated artifact collections from excavation and survey projects in southern Arizona and northern Mexico, we have identified 58 Empire points at 21 sites in southeastern and east-central Arizona, one site in northern Mexico, and ten isolated occurrences in southern Arizona and northern Mexico (Figure 7; Table 3). The range of Empire points extends from Tonto Creek to the north, northern Mexico (between Sonora and the Seri Coast) to the south, the Cimarron Mountains to the west, and the Peloncillo Mountains to the east. However, their currently known distribution is centered in the middle Santa Cruz and Cienega valleys-where the most intensive archaeological inves- tigations have been conducted. This geographic range overlaps that of San Pedro points (Figure 8), which are occasionally found in northern and east-central Ari- zona (Sliva 2002a, 2002b) but are more commonly distributed across southern, central, and western Arizona, west of the Rio Grande River, and southward into northern Mexico (Mabry 1998a: 149). Temporal Distributions Although Empire points can be relatively dated by their frequent association with San Pedro points, more reliable dating of this style is derived from eight excavated San Pedro phase sites in southern Arizona that have produced Empire points. Las Capas has the tightest chronological control with 44 radiocarbon determinations on annual plants and wood charcoal (Mabry 2001). Based on a combination of radiocarbon dates and stratigraphy, Las Capas has been subdivided into early and late intervals. The early San Pedro phase, represented by Stratum 6A (Horizons 7, 8, 9, and 10) and Stratum 6B (Horizon 11), is stratigraphically separated from the late San Pedro phase (Stratum 4, Horizons 1 through 6) by approximately 1 m of sterile alluvium. Based on radiocarbon determinations of annual plants, Stratum 6A of the early San Pedro phase has an average uncalibrated radiocarbon age of 2824 b.p. (5 dates) and Stratum 6B has an average uncalibrated date of 2897 b.p. (6 dates). One of the six Empire points recovered from DAI's excavations in Stratum 6A came from a bell-shaped pit that produced a radiocarbon date of 2780 a 40 b.p. (Beta-140059) on maize. No points were recovered from DAI's excavations in Stratum 6B. Nearly 40 Empire points were recovered from early San Pedro phase contexts (Stratum 6A) in the western portion of Las Capas, which was excavated by SWCA, Inc. in 1999 (Lascaux and Hesse 2001). Radiocarbon dates from the SWCA excavations are consistent with an early San Pedro phase designation.

The late San Pedro phase (Stratum 4) has an average uncalibrated date of 2692 b.p. based on radiocarbon dates on 18 samples from annual plant remains. One of the five Empire points recovered from DAI's late San Pedro Stratum 4 was in a bell-shaped pit (Feature 471) that produced a radiocarbon date on maize of 3000 + 30 b.p. (Beta-140054). This date is out of stratigraphic sequence with the majority of dates from Strata 4 and 6A, suggesting Feature 471 had been disturbed. Because the majority of Empire points at Las Capas were recovered from early San Pedro levels, Empire points probably are best dated to the early San Pedro phase. When all of the C14 samples from DAI and SWCA's excavations at Las Capas have been completed, this temporal placement and range may be refined further. Seven other excavated sites with Empire points have dated materials that are not directly associated with the Empire points including (from west to east) Ventana Cave (AZ Z:12:5), Coffee Camp (AZ AA:6:19), Cortaro Fan (AZ AA:12:486), Los Pozos (AZ AA:12:91), Wetlands (AZ AA:12:90), Milagro (AZ BB:10:46), Split Ridge (AZ EE:2:103), and the Ballcourt site (AZ EE:2:105). Three Empire points have been identified in the Arizona State Museum's col- lections from Ventana Cave (Haury 1950). Two are from the upper cave (Grid M2, Level 2, 0.5-1.0 m depth; Grid L3, Level 3, 1.0-1.5 m depth); the third could not be provenienced due to unclear labeling. These generally correspond to types Haury defined with parallel-sided or expanding stems, round tangs, and either convex or straight bases (Haury 1950:Figures 60a-f, 62e-h), although it must be understood that not all of the points covered by these broad descriptions can be classified as Empire points. For this reason, the occurrence of the Haury types throughout the sequence in the Upper Cave (as well as the single example cited from the Red Sand layer; Haury 1950:Table 21) should not be viewed as compromising the chro- nological placement of the Empire points in the early San Pedro phase of the Early Agricultural period. Because Ventana cave was excavated in arbitrary 0.5 m levels (Haury 1950), the Empire points can only be relatively dated by associated point types. Based on the Las Capas dates, Empire points should be found in the stratigraphically oldest Early Agricultural period levels, i.e., levels showing a decrease in Middle Archaic point styles and an increase in Early Agricultural period point styles. Based on Roth and Huckell's (1992) calculations of the frequency of Cortaro, Pinto, San Pedro, and Cienega points in various excavated levels at Ventana Cave, Level 3 has a higher percentage of Middle Archaic points than Early Agricultural period points. Cortaro and Pinto points comprise 42.9 percent and 14.3 percent of the point assemblage (n = 56), whereas San Pedro and Cienega points comprise 39.3 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively (Roth and Huckell 1992:363). Level 2 contains more Early Agricultural period points (58.8 percent San Pedro and 1.3 percent</page><page sequence="19">Empire Points 315 Cienega points) than Middle Archaic points (26.3 percent Cortaro and 13.8 percent Pinto points) in the point assemblage (n = 80) (Roth and Huckell 1992:363). There- fore, the distribution of Empire points at Ventana Cave is consistent with an Early Agricultural period date range. On the northern Santa Cruz floodplain, Coffee Camp has produced 57 points including Pinto, Chiricahua, San Pedro, Cienega, and unidentified point styles (Halbirt et al. 1993). Two Empire points, identified in a grouping of San Pedro points (Halbirt et al. 1993:Speciman 1384, Figure 3.7 and Specimen 1433, Figure 3.8), are not directly associated with dated materials. However, 14 radiocarbon dates collected at the site indicate a multi-component site with Late Archaic, ceramic, and proto-historic period occupations (Halbirt et al. 1993:67). No culti- vated remains were recovered from Late Archaic period contexts. The two Late Archaic components date to 3120-2870 B.P. and 2250-1920 B.P. (Halbirt et al. 1993:67), which are coeval with the San Pedro and Cienega phases, respectively. Researchers at the site believe the majority of the Late Archaic occupation dates to the 2250-1920 B.P. range (Halbirt et al. 1993:67). At the Cortaro Fan site, only one Empire point (FN 31), collected from the surface of Unit 2D, has been identified. Although the Empire point is not directly associated with dated materials, five radiocarbon dates on mesquite charcoal and maize (Roth 1989:201) indicate two Cienega phase occupations that can be tenta- tively dated to 2800-2600 B.P. (dates obtained on maize) and 2300-2200 B.P. (dates obtained on mesquite and saltbush charcoal). At the Milagro site, one Empire point and four San Pedro points were recovered from the fills of six pits (Huckell et al. 1995). At the time, Huckell et al. (1995:25) noted that the point we now recognize as Empire had unusual narrowness and extremely shallow notches. He suggested the point was probably within the range of variation for the San Pedro point style, or alternatively, "some sort of hafted knife" (Huckell et al. 1995:25, Figure 3.1 d). The Empire point was recovered from Feature 60, which is not directly associated with dated material. Six radiocarbon dates on maize and wood charcoal from other feature fills at the site produced dates clustering near 2900 B.P. and near 2800 B.P. (Huckell et al. 1995:21). These dates place the occupation at Milagro (and indirectly date the Empire point style) to about a 200-year time span in the San Pedro phase. One Empire point, recovered in the Central Cluster at the Los Pozos site, appears to have been slightly reworked into a drill (Sliva 2001). An additional Empire point was previously reported as a Pinto point (Sliva 2001). Other projectile points recovered at the site include Early Archaic, San Pedro, possible Basketmaker, Cienega, and Elko-Eared points, and point fragments (Sliva 2001). More than 19 radiocarbon dates and numerous fluoride dates from the Central Cluster of Los Pozos (Gregory et al. 2001) securely place the Central Cluster occupation in the late Cienega phase (400 B.C.-A.D. 50) (Gregory 2001). Because one of the points is reworked, it may have been manufactured during an earlier period (like the Early</page><page sequence="20">316 STEVENS AND SLIVA Archaic and Pinto point styles) and collected, reused, and discarded during the Cienega phase. One Empire point from Feature 131 at the Wetlands site (AZ AA: 12:90) has been identified. Although not directly associated with dated materials, 11 radiocarbon dates from the site indicate a substantial early Cienega phase occupation and a very small San Pedro phase occupation (one feature) (Freeman 1998). Another Empire point was located on the surface of AZ AA: 12:41, a site that was later split into several smaller sites including Los Pozos, Wetlands, and AZ AA: 12:103. It is possible that the Empire points at the Central Cluster of Los Pozos, Wetlands, and at AZ AA: 12:41 were origi- nally associated with the small San Pedro phase occupation at Wetlands, or perhaps, another as yet unidentified San Pedro phase occupation in the area. At the Split Ridge site in the northern Santa Rita Mountains, two Empire points, located in the S1/2 of Feature 3 (3.67 MBD) and in the SE1/4 of Grid N28, E38 (Stratum 1, Level 1), have been identified. The other 13 projectile points recovered include Cienega, San Pedro, Elko series, unidentified point styles, and untypeable point fragments, none of which were directly associated with dated material (Huckell 1984:198). Based on dated material from rock-filled features (probable hearths), Split Ridge appears to have two cultural components: a small Middle Archaic com- ponent, represented by a conventional radiocarbon date of 4690 + 100 B.P. (A-2931) obtained from Feature 5 (Huckell 1984:86), and a more extensive Cienega phase component, dated by a fragment of a carbonized walnut hull from Feature 7 to 2500 + 150 B.P. (AA-245) (Huckell 1984:86). The Ballcourt site (AZ EE:2:105) in the northern Santa Rita Mountains con- tained one Empire point recovered from the SE 1/4 of Feature 10 (Stratum 10) (Ferg et al. 1984). Based on temporally diagnostic pottery, a single radiocarbon date, and archaeomagnetic dating, the Ballcourt site has multiple occupations dating to the Colonial and Sedentary periods, A.D. 750-1150 (Ferg et al. 1984). Most likely, the Empire point was manufactured during the Early Agricultural period and later picked up, reused, and discarded during the ceramic period. Empire points are most abundant and most securely dated to the early San Pedro phase based on direct and indirect associations of Empire points with dated materials at Las Capas. However, Empire points continue to be found in low fre- quencies in the Cienega phase occupations at seven other sites, suggesting that they were either occasionally manufactured, or collected and reused during the Cienega phase. Empire points recovered from ceramic period sites are almost certainly ex- amples of reuse and were probably not manufactured after the Early Agricultural period (i.e., post-A.D. 50). Associated Point Styles Only San Pedro, Elko series, and Datil points share certain morphological resem- blances to Empire points. Since the physical attributes and spatial and temporal</page><page sequence="21">Empire Points 317 distribution of San Pedro points have already been discussed, a brief summary of the morphology, temporal range, and geographic distribution of Elko and Datil points is presented. Elko style points have broad blades, deep comer notches with broad expanding stems, and concave bases (Heizer and Baumhoff 1961). Several Elko subtypes have been identified, including Elko Corner-notched, Elko Eared, Elko Side-notched, and Elko Contracting Stem. Only Elko Corner-notched points, however, resemble San Pedro (Shackley 1996) and, marginally, Empire points. Geographically, Elko Corner-notched points are found throughout the Great Ba- sin, U.S. Southwest, southern California, and northern Baja California, Mexico (Mabry 1998a). The temporal range of various Elko style points differs widely among the geographic regions in which they are found (Holmer 1986). In south- eastern Arizona, Elko style points have been found at several sites (Altschul and Jones 1990; Chavarria 1996; Douglas and Craig 1986; Halbirt and Henderson 1993; Huckell 1984; Phillips et al. 1993; Steere 1987). Based on the temporal ranges of associated points at these sites, Elko style points in southern Arizona probably date 4500-2500 b.p. (Mabry 1998a; Mabry and Stevens 2000). Datil points are a less commonly known point style found in northern Mexico, where they are associated with an unnamed culture (Marrs 1949 Type 23; cited in Dick 1965:29), and at Bat Cave in the central Mogollon Highlands, New Mexico (Dick 1965). Morphologically, they have a modified parallelogram outline with a straight base, parallel sides, and parallel blade edges (Dick 1965:29). The shoul- ders consist of small knobs formed by serrations, which extend down both edges of the blade (Dick 1965:29). Five of the eight Datil points discovered at Bat Cave were found in Level V (Dick 1965:23). The remaining three points were recovered from Levels I, IV, and VI (Dick 1965:23). The original excavations at Bat Cave took place in the area of the small shelters (shelters lA, iB, IC, and 1D). Wills (1988) later conducted test excavations in shelter lA and in the fronts of shelters 1B and 1D and determined that vandals had removed most of the preceramic stratigraphy of the small shelters. Therefore, the preceramic stratig- raphy had to be reconstructed almost exclusively from Dick's original field records. Based on Wills' (1988) reanalysis of stratigraphic relationships and dating of Bat Cave, most of the artifacts from Level V probably came from an intrusive pit in shelter IC that was not recognized during the original excavations (Wills 1988:117). Although two radiocarbon dates on charcoal place Level V at 3049- 5549 B.C. (Dick 1965:18-19) and 3655 + 290 B.c. (Mangelsdorf 1954:409), a 6000- 5600 B.P. date range for all of the archaeological material from Levels V and VI in shelter IC is questionable (Wills 1988:118). A third date of 2862 + 250 B.P. (C-170), on uncarbonized wood that was attributed to Level V, probably came from the intrusive pit. Based on the stratigraphy and other radiocarbon dates at the site, most artifacts in Level V-and, by extension, Datil points--date between 2800 and 2200 B.P. (Wills 1988:117).</page><page sequence="22">318 STEVENS AND SLIVA CONCLUSIONS The identification of Empire points as a new projectile point style diagnostic of the early San Pedro phase has a number of implications for the interpretation of Early Agricultural period adaptations in southeastern Arizona and northern Mexico. The most obvious is that there is more variability in projectile point styles in southeast- ern Arizona and northern Sonora than previously thought. This variability may be attributed to 1) overlapping geographic ranges of two or more culturally distinct groups, 2) different hafting and technological traditions, 3) different intended func- tions of the point styles, or perhaps, 4) a combination of these. The distinctive blade and hafting element styles distinguishing San Pedro and Empire points may represent expressions of cultural identity, particularly in light of the architectural variability associated with the San Pedro phase. San Pedro phase architecture is typically characterized by small, roughly oval-shaped pit struc- tures-sometimes with large floor pits-and bell-shaped extramural storage pits. Additional architectural forms identified at the early San Pedro phase occupation at Las Capas include specialized storehouses, small pit structures (or roofed, bell- shaped pits) (Mabry 2001), and five large shallow pit structures (Lascaux and Hesse 2001). The largest pit structure had a maximum floor area of 19.43 sq m. One of the large pit structures (Feature 600) contained almost 40 Empire points in various stages of manufacture (Lascaux and Hesse 2001). This is possibly the first identified communal structure in the U.S. Southwest. The next large pit structure, however, does not appear in the archaeological record until the late San Pedro phase-approximately 200-300 years later-after which time such structures were more commonplace. The large ovoid pit structure at the Split Ridge site (Feature 14; floor area of 15.5 sq m) dates to 2500 + 150 B.P. (Huckell 1984:83-86). A total of five large pit structures (averaging 14.72 sq m, range 13.5-15.8 sq m) are known from the Cienega phase occupations at Coffee Camp (Halbirt et al. 1993), Santa Cruz Bend (Mabry et al. 1997), and Stone Pipe (Swartz and Lindeman 1997). Very large pit structures, or "Big Houses" (i.e., floor areas between 44.5 sq m and 59.5 sq m), first appeared in the Cienega phase at Santa Cruz Bend (Mabry et al. 1997:224) and Wetlands (Archer and Freeman 1998:41). Because point styles may be shared between groups that consistently communicate and exchange information while exploiting shared resource areas, regardless of either's ethnic origin (Holmer 1986:112), the fact that Empire points are also found at sites without very large pit structures (e.g., Milagro) suggests that additional supporting evidence from multiple material classes and sites is necessary before Empire points can be associated with a specific cultural identity. Empire and San Pedro points may represent different hafting traditions that were alternative solutions to similar technological problems. During the Early Agricultural period, hafting traditions probably sought to produce blades that could be rejuvenated (Shackley 1996), improve the accuracy and penetration of points, decrease the frequency of shaft damage, and allow easy rehafting of new or</page><page sequence="23">Empire Points 319 reworked points after breakage (Bryan 1980; Holmer 1986; Keeley 1982; Mabry 1998a:6; Musil 1988). Wills (1988) suggests that increased blade-to-base width ratio of hafting designs between the Middle and Late Archaic point types in the U.S. Southwest increased the effective diameter of Late Archaic points, making them penetrate more deeply than Middle Archaic points. The longer blades of Late Archaic points also helped to improve accuracy and efficiency (Wills 1988). Empire points have significantly narrower haft and blade widths than San Pedro points, which would have decreased the effective diameter of the point, and perhaps accuracy and efficiency. However, they also have longer blade length-to-blade width ratios, which may have offset the negative effects of the narrower haft and blade. In the Picacho Dune area, overlapping geographic distributions of coeval Middle Archaic projectile point styles, namely Pinto/San Jose and Chiricahua points, have been cited as evidence of different social groups with different resource procurement strategies (Bayham et al. 1986:372). Although frequently found together in surface assemblages, Pinto/San Jose and Chiricahua points were found in mutually exclusive, yet roughly contemporaneous, buried deposits (Bayham et al. 1986). Based on other attributes of the artifact assemblage, Bayham et al. (1986) have suggested that Chiricahua points may be associated with less mobile gatherers and Pinto/San Jose points may be associated with highly mobile hunters occupying the uplands and peripheral areas (Bayham et al. 1986:371). Empire points may have had a different intended function than San Pedro points. Hafting tradition models generally postulate a sequence of increasingly efficient hafting designs (Bryan 1980; Holmer 1986; Keeley 1982; Mabry 1998a:6; Musil 1988). Hunting strategies, techniques, and point style, however, may change with the intended function and type of game hunted (Howard 1995). For example, Pinto points may have been the preferred point to hunt deer, whereas Gypsum points were the preferred point to use with bighorn sheep (Holmer 1980a, 1980b). Use- wear analysis and experimentation would be necessary to determine possible func- tional differences between San Pedro phase point styles; unfortunately, few of the San Pedro points available for study are made from the cryptocrystalline materials required for high-power microwear analysis, and standard laboratory cleaning pro- cedures involving immersion in hydrochloric acid will likely have removed any residues that might have permitted antisera analysis to differentiate target species (Vaughan 1985:44). Regardless of whether Empire points represent cultural affiliation, different hafting traditions, or different intended functions, Empire points in southern Arizona appear to be strongly associated with a suite of material culture traits (including San Pedro points, roughly oval and round pit structures, bell-shaped pits, and maize agriculture) that migrated north from northern Mexico. Whether or not this suite of material culture traits represented a movement of people or ideas, or both is still being determined. Unfortunately, there are still too few Empire points identified in northwestern Mexico to determine the strength of association between Empire</page><page sequence="24">320 STEVENS AND SLIVA points and this suite of material culture traits in Mexico. Therefore, it is not clear if this point style originated in northern Mexico and spread north into southern Arizona or originated in southern Arizona and spread south into northern Mexico. Either way, the recognition of Empire points as a distinct early San Pedro phase point style is an important step in understanding the cultural variability marking this time of the transition to agriculture. END NOTES 1. All site numbers are Arizona State Museum site number designations. 2. Shackley (1996) proposes using metric attributes, primarily blade width and thickness (and, to some degree, neck width), to distinguish San Pedro from Elko Corner-notched points, a style associated with the Late Archaic in the Great Basin and northern Arizona. However, one of the points included in his limited sample is actually a Cienega Flared, rather than an Elko point (Shackley 1996:Figure 3g), and another, whose measurements appear to fall well below the blade and neck width parameters he established for Elko points (Shackley 1996:Figure 3f), was excluded from the summarized values for the style presented in his table of mean and central tendency data (Shackley 1996:Table 4). In lieu of an analysis involving large samples of both San Pedro and Elko points, notch shape appears to be the primary and most reliable attribute distinguishing the two styles. Elko notches are v-shaped and extend diagonally up from the corners formed by the basal and lateral edges of the point blank, resulting in a relatively short, diagonally expanding hafting element (cf. Heizer and Hester 1978:Figures 3f, g, j; Thomas 1981:Figures 8a-n; Holmer 1986:Figure 11a; Shackley 1996:Figure 5b). This contrasts with San Pedro notches, which range from relatively shallow c-shaped notches placed on the sides of the blank to relatively deep half-heart-shaped notches on the sides and corners. In addition, many Elko Corner-Notched points have concave bases, an attribute associated only rarely with San Pedro points. 3. Whereas Empire stems are typically straight, the stems on a few of the specimens examined for this study have edges that are concave enough to pass for side-notched. These are classified as Empire rather than San Pedro points, however, because of the shallowness of the side notches and their Empire- like long, narrow, serrated blades. Whether these represent some transitional form between the two styles or a blending of design elements has yet to be determined. Acknowledgments.
