<plain_text><page sequence="1">Problems of Instinct and Intelligence. By R. W. G. HINGSTON. New York, The Macmillan Company, 1929. Pp. xiii, 296. Major Hingston is a 'naturalist' who writes in fluent style a book which is best reviewed by reference to the extremely cautious preface written for it by Bertrand Russell. After some general and complimentary remarks, Russell is impelled to point out that Hingston's treatment of insect memory "goes be- yond what his data warrant" and that his view of mental evolution "assumes the inheritance of acquired characters in a very extreme form" (p. xii). The very presence of such criticisms in the introduction may serve as a warning that the reader must proceed at his own risk in accepting without question Hing- ston's not infrequently startling conclusions. The author obtains most of his factual material from his own observations in the field, supplementing this, however, with a well-documented supply of quotations, chiefly from the Peckhams, Forel and Fabre. His early chapters advance evidence of this sort regarding the perfection, wisdom, rhythm and variability of instinct, as well as its limitations, flexibility and folly. He is convinced that insect behavior is not limited to instinctive patterns, but that it includes, as well, behavior typical of memory, of intelligence, and of an 'un- known sense' which serves to explain the activity of migration. Observing largely among the Hymenoptera, he finds many cases in which insects depart from conventional patterns of behavior in meeting novel situations. Thus he describes how ants build bridges and platforms to help one another, how wasps vary their methods of attack under special circumstances, and how other in- sects meet new situations 'intelligently.' Hingston holds that "We cannot explain psychic phenomena by reducing things to physical and chemical laws. Even insect psychology has something else. It has memory and conscious mind" (p. 247). Instinct, he finds, "began</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 669 in a reasoned act ... this act, through being continually repeated, tended to lose the reasoning element and to become more and more unconscious. As this process continued through generations, the mental machinery by which it worked got more indelibly engraven in the mind. And in the end it became automatic-in other words, it became instinctive" (p. 268). There is a wealth of descriptive material in the book, but it is to be re- gretted that the author chose to illustrate entirely by sketches, without the use of photographs. There is a singular lack of negative evidence, as well as an irritating refusal to define terms, both of which detract from the value of the treatment. Thus Hingston refuses to define his terms 'instinct' and 'in- telligence,' because he regards them as "incapable of accurate definition," and "everyone knows what is meant" by these terms. His writing is anthropomorphic throughout the volume; thus he finds that an ant returns to a former feeding place because "the thought of food has recalled to its memory its experiences of twelve hours before" (p. 242), while a wasp acts preoccupied because "her attention is absorbed in energetic effort; hence she cannot fix it on other things" (p. 237).
