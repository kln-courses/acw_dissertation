<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS two records) goes an appreciable distance ahead of any other known writer on the subject. It could have been wished that he had gone a step farther and pruned his adjectives a hint more stringently. To one who has never heard a black redstart it is little help to be told it has a " wild, penetrating warble ". Again it is useless to say that the stonechat's song is "a brief, scrappy, warbling affair ", though as soon as one is told that the song is " often uttered on the wing, in a jerky hovering song-flight " one is immediately provided with valuable data. Admittedly the task is difficult, as difficult as the concert reporter's nightly job of describing varieties of the human voice in song. Perhaps it cannot be done in any way. Certainly the use of abstract adjectives (joyous: for the wren, not for the bird but for its performance in song; cheerful: for the dunnock; spirited and not unmusical: the wheatear; dashing: the chaffinch) hinders because no two readers will agree as to the precise meaning of such terms, and precision is indispensable. It is here that Mr. Koch's records come in, for they render unnecessary any attempt to translate bird song into verbal symbols. They give the ear, as nearly as can be demanded, the real right thing. The surface scratch of these records is their only blemish and one wonders why this need be so exceedingly harsh. It is to be hoped that means will be discovered by Mr. Koch and the Parlophone engineers to alter this, for at present one seems to be hearing some of these birds but a foot or so off the main London-Portsmouth road with its continual stream of lorries and traction engines. Nevertheless, that, like the matter of Mr. Nicholson's adjectives, is a small point in comparison with what this book and its accompanying records give one. As regards the book, we welcome a method as free as is Mr. Nicholson's from the anthropomorphic approach. The birds are treated as birds, not as friends, dependants, enemies or other peripheral appendages of the human race. The records mark the beginning of an almost endless activity, since there is no saying where the recording of bird song is to stop. The vista opened before us is fascinating apart from its more obvious scientific value, and one looks to the day when the record library will gradually become enriched with the thousands, the millions, of bird voices from the whole of the earth's surface. With a Nicholson to aid us we shall begin to understand hidden aspects of the matter -why, for instance, some birds sing with a closed bill. Finally, to the notice of bird lovers is commended the delightfully mischievous implica- tion (or does the malice exist only in the mind of one reader ?) that, since " many species are stimulated to song when they are disturbed ", a judicious balance between marauding cats (certainly not their present merciless extinction) may help to increase the bird song in our back gardens. S. G. Origine des instruments de musique: introduction ethnographique da 'histoire de la musique instrumentale. By Andre Schaeffner. pp. 405. (Payot, Paris, I936.) With one of the great ethnographical collections of Europe at his command and a personal acquaintance with primitive peoples both in Africa and America, M. Schaeffner has been able to present to us in this treatise a remarkable survey of man's earliest efforts in music-making; 301</page><page sequence="2">MUSIC AND LETTERS though it may not always win our assent in its conclusions, it cannot fail to arrest our attention and stimulate further enquiry. Believing, as he does, that in the origin and development of sound-producing instru- ments we have the most reliable key to the history of music throughout the ages, he begins with the axiom that the instrumental music of the present day owes its origin to the dance and not to song, although certain effects, such as the glissando and vibrato, have evidently been taken from this latter source. He therefore traces its beginnings to the ordinary customs and common utensils of primitive life, which would naturally lend themselves to accentuating the rhythmic measures of the dance, such as the clapping of hands, the beating of food-troughs and the grating of mill-stones. The first and third of these processes, he considers, suggested the rattles, cymbals, castanets, etc., whilst the second provided the skin-less wooden drums and, with logs laid across them or tongues cut in their substance, the marimbas and xylophones. To this simple trough-drum succeeded the skin-headed drum. Whistles arose from the imitation of bird-calls used in hunting and the stringed instruments from traps and snares. Arms of war have given us the shield-drum and gong; the boomerang the clappers. We cannot, however, credit his statement that the well-known musical bow preceded the hunting bow; palaeological evidence, as well as tribal tradition and usage, appears to be definitely against it. The special chapter dealing with the association of musical instruments and religions or magical cults is excellently written and full of interesting details ; for, as the author reminds us, such instruments, in addition to their rhythmic sense, possess timbre, a quality of sound which may either gratify or offend the ear, attract or repel the listener. In this way they have been used to draw down the attention of the gods or, on the other hand, to scare the demons; of such practices carnival, in his opinion, is a present-day survival. It would seem, however, that the writer's fancy has carried him somewhat far afield, when he suggests that the paten and chalice of the Christian sacrament are relics of the tambourine and cymbals which characterized the frenzied worship of Cybele. In the derivation of stringed instruments the tambour de bois and the tambour de terre play a large part and he reaches the conclusion that strings were in the first instance applied to an existing resonator or sound-box, and not the resonator to the strings. It is, of course, true that we have instances in which the bark or rind of the wooden body is cut into strips and these are raised on small bridges after the manner of the zither and psaltery ; in other cases strings are stretched over troughs similar to those used for holding food. But there always remains the question whether these devices of existing primitive peoples may not, after all, be imitative of higher cultures rather than original. It is interesting to note that M. Schaeffner attributes the invention of the bow-shaped harp to Sumerian or to Indian sources, but, as he will have little to do with the hunting bow, he names as its first parent the canoe ! He considers, however, that the harp preceded the lyre in point of time and that the lute or guitar form followed later. He traces the possible origin of the violin bow and, after stressing the difference between " scraping " and " bowing ", attributes it to the practice, found, for instance, amongst American-Indian tribes, of rubbing two hunting-bows 302</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS OF BOOKS together. In this, as in other cases, our author seems to have overlooked the witness of the great Asiatic continent, man's earliest home. Passing to the wind instruments or " instruments A air ", as he prefers to call them, the Hottentot gora and the Australian bull-roarer are described and also a curious trompe de terre. Prehistoric whistles are passed in review, but little is said of the transverse flute. The pipe with two conical tubes and double-beating reeds preceded that with a single conical tube. The little ring of pipes in the Chinese mouth-organ (cheng) he attributes to the dance-circle and as for the organ-claims of Ctesibius, he holds them greatly exaggerated. The source of the trumpet is found in the speaking tube (porte-voix). From the origin of the instruments we pass to the evolution of their music and, in an exhaustive manner, the oriental beginnings of notation, the rise of heterophony, paraphony and polyphony are dealt with. In the repetition of set phrases by massed bands or choirs of native tribesmen the contrapuntal elements of canon and fugue appear when the respective groups overlap each other instead of maintaining time and unison. For the diffusion of instruments amongst the races of mankind Dr. Curt Sachs's strata system, as set out in his 'Geist und Werden der Musikinstrumente ', is discussed and criticized; a needed warning is also given of the perils of hasty etymological inferences. Following on the text a new scheme for the classification of musical instruments is set out. Without wishing to detract from its intrinsic interest, we may gather from its construction the real purpose and principle of the whole work. It is ethnographical rather than musical. For, as a true ethnologist, the author classes his subject on the lines of the materials used (wood, metal, stone, bone, shell, etc.) and for the history of human development such a view is important. In this way too he follows the age-long practice of the Chinese, who group their instruments by their substances, though their object in so doing is cosmological. But for the musician the material employed is of quite minor account; even the author admits that the modern division of wind instruments into " wood " and " brass " is faulty, though the material may at times control the shape. The main point for the musician is, of course, the acoustical and sound-producing principles involved. It is, therefore, momentarily disconcerting to find in his classification but two divisions-" instruments 'a corps solide vibrant " and " instru- ments a air vibrant "-the former with three subdivisions (non-tensile, flexible and tensile) including bells, drums, rattles, xylophones, cymbals, Jew's harp, musical box, cither, harp, lute, vielle, etc. ; and the latter embracing the bull-roarer, siren, harmonium, pot-tambour, tambour de terre, flute, trumpet, horn, clarinet, oboe, etc. In the first division the "material " arrangement is followed; in the second it is discarded. There are numerous wood-cuts in the text and thirty-two double plates of instruments descriptive of the subject. Students will also be grateful to M. Schaeffner for the splendid bibliography, most detailed and well-arranged, with which he has concluded his work. Unfortunately he has failed them in a most vital point, which renders his closely printed volume of over four hundred pages with yet more closely printed foot- notes, inconvenient and difficult for reference and consultation-there are no brief digests of the contents of the ten very long chapters and, horribile dictu, no index.
