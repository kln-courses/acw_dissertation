<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEGEL'S RATIONALISM ON the centenary of a philosopher's death we come not to re- bury or to praise him, but rather to better understand him, ourselves, and the world in which we live. If Hegel were dead it were best not to disturb his dust-to let the dead past bury its dead. Honest criticism is ruled out by the maxim " De mortuis nihil nisi bonum ", and conventional eulogy should be barred by the Tal- mudic warning that there is a day of judgment coming for the orator as well as for the deceased. But in the realm of thought Hegel is not dead. He is still alive, perhaps too much so. His ideas dominate our evolutionary social sciences as well as most diverse schools of philosophy and theology. We can see this in the dialectic materialism of the orthodox Marx- ism which is disturbing the world, as well as in the Oxford idealism of our Anglo-American thought, which offers solace and support to the established order of spiritual values. Popular as well as radical philosophic thought seems to be ruled by his dogma that the abstract is unreal. Above all, Hegel still fashions our concepts of the history of social institutions, art, religion, and philosophy. Indeed, as to the history of philosophy his method of approach seems to be in almost exclusive possession of the field, though few recognize it as Hegelian in origin. No one, I take it, denies that in the extent and depth of his insights Hegel is one of the great figures in the history of human thought, and that on many points in ethics, politics, art, religion, and the interpretation of human history, we can still learn much from him. Yet, it must also be admitted that, at least in our own country,1 there has for the last thirty years been relatively little direct study of him, and that his influence has persisted only through the work of such expounders and independent assimilators as Green, Caird, Bosanquet, Bradley, Royce, and their idealist disciples. To promote a better understanding of Hegel, it is there- 1 Hibben's Hegel's Logic (I902) and Cunningham's Thought and Reality in Hegel's System (I9io) seem to be our only extended studies of Hegel published this century. 283</page><page sequence="2">284 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLI. fore not sufficient to pick out some one or other of his ideas and judge it according to its agreement or disagreement with our own present views. That is what he himself characterized as external reflection. If we wish to get at the heart of Hegel's life-work, we must note his insistence, from the beginning to the end of his career, that philosophic truth is identical with system and method. If we ask Hegel himself for the distinctive traits of his philo- sophy, we find no pretense of offering us any new views of God, the physical world, human nature, knowledge, or duty. He does not regard himself as an innovator, but rather as one in a histori- cal series of workers, trying to elaborate systematically the supreme truth that the real world is spiritual or mental. This according to Hegel is not only the view of all previous philosophers, but is involved in all human aspiration. The only claim he ever makes for himself is that of having adopted the true and definitive method for revealing or proving this ultimately spiritual nature of things. It seems hardly questionable that Hegel regarded his logical or dialectic method as necessarily involved in what we call his meta- physical idealism or spiritualism. Not only is mind or spirit the highest definition of reality (the absolute), but thought (as philo- sophy) is the highest expression of spirit, so that the ultimate nature of things can be revealed only by rational thought. Hence his repeated assertion that the rational is real and the real is rational. This insistence on the rational character of reality seems to justify the characterization of Hegel as a panlogist, which was made current by the acute and learned J. E. Erdmann. But it is highly instructive and characteristic of the dangers and difficulties in the understanding of Hegel that some of the most respect- inspiring of his recent expositors, like Kroner and N. Hartmann, have called him the greatest irrationalist in the history of human thought. The lover of irony may remark that this is in harmony with Hegel's identification of opposites. But though suggestive this observation can hardly be regarded as adequate. Common sense 2 See the preface to the Phenomenologie (1807) and the second preface to the Wissenschaft der Logik (1831).

But, in reply, it may well be urged that the method insists that truth is to be found not in concepts as such, but in their ultimate outcome. Hartmann's contention, however, is in fact supported by cogent arguments that illumine the substance of Hegel's philosophy, though they do not seem to me to remove the ground for the tradi- tional panlogistic, or rationalistic interpretation. It is true that the content of Hegel's philosophy, especially in the field of politics, art, and religion, is only outwardly constrained by the recurrent trinities of the dialectic form. But Hegel's insistent monism leaves no basis for any distinction between form and content. It is also true that the rational, which is the real according to him, is not merely finite human reason, but a metaphysical world- reason, divine and absolute. But " if mind is the absolute essence of all reality, individual mind and absolute mind are thereby identified ",4 and it is difficult to see how there can be anything really unknowable or irrational for human thought. We must grant Hartmann's point that Hegel's categories are not concerned with logical inference, but are rather of ontologic significance and sufficiently diverse and concrete to deal with living problems. Still, this does not deny the great importance which Hegel attaches to the logical transition from one category to another. Nor can we deny that in general the removal of logical contradiction is alleged as the motive power of the progress from one category to another. Hartmann finally contends that far from denying the existence of irrationality in the form of contradiction, Hegel finds it in all things, and the dialectic process does not remove it, but only places it in the absolute. This, however, cannot eliminate the fact that Hegel regards the process of reconciling contra- dictions as terminating in a reality which is completely rational and indeed is identical with rationality itself. These brief considerations make it clear that we cannot ade- quately understand Hegel by labeling him either as a rationalist or as an irrationalist. We do not do justice to the content of his 4 Baillie, Origin and Significance of Hegel's Logic, p. i86.</page><page sequence="4">286 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLI. thought if we think of his system as so rationally concatenated that, once we grant being, we are bound by his ineluctable logic to follow him through the categories of being, essence, and concept, through the philosophy of nature, up to mind, subjective, objective, and absolute. Neither can we accept the view of those who, interested in the application of his views to some empirical issues of politics or history, completely disregard the idealistic system which is developed in his principal works, the Phenomenologie and the Logik, which underlies his philosophy of nature and largely molds, if it does not completely determine, his philosophy of right and his philosophy of mind. A sound interpretation must trace the conflicting motives of his rationalistic spiritualism and the empirical content which he tries to put into that system with the aid of his dialectic method. We can barely indicate the direc- tion of such an interpretation by some comments on the three parts of his system, the logic, the philosophy of nature, and the philo- sophy of mind. I Hegel's logical system can be called rationalistic if it is regarded either as a rigorous proof that ultimate reality is mind or idea, or as a description of the absolute world-process as a system or development. The notion that the dialectic method has great logical cogency will not stand the test of rigorous scrutiny. The order in which the various categories succeed each other is at times highly arbi- trary, and, in fact, varies in the various versions which Hegel has given us in the Logik, Propardeustic, and Encyclopiidie, without claiming any one of these to be the correct one. At its best, the claim for the dialectic is that it finds the assertion of an in- dispensable category, like being, involving us in contradictions, and that these contradictions are solved, removed, or absorbed by taking a higher category, like becoming or determinate being. Let us grant that this method is often illuminating. But the illum- ination depends in each case upon a fortunate discovery, and Hegel never offers proof that some other category than the one dis- covered would not answer the purpose as well. Without such proof there is an element of contingency in the order of the cate- gories, e.g., when cognition follows syllogism. Many of the</page><page sequence="5">No. 3.1 HEGEL'S RATIONALISM 287 transitions are fantastic and supported only by verbal plays. A good deal of what he says about quantity and measure is definitely antiquated, and his attacks on Newton's calculus nothing more than perverse ingenuity.5 Related, but not identical with the view of the dialectic as a method of proof, is the view of it as a process of discovery or reconstruction. According to this view, the mind begins with the simplest object, to wit, being, and by thinking it finds or recon- structs the whole system which is its reality. There are insuperable difficulties in viewing the dialectic as a process of finding the nature of reality. If the mind finds the world in this way, the world must be supposed to have existed be- fore our finding it, and the order of thought in the process of dis- covery is not the order of the being that is thus found. This strikes a snag in Hegel's monistic refusal to distinguish between the order of thought and the order of being. On the other hand, if by means of the dialectic the mind con- structs reality, an insuperable difficulty arises as to the relation be- tween the individual mind and the absolute. Do we create the ab- solute when we think it? Nor can we avoid difficulty by saying that every time we think the dialectic, the absolute constructs or creates himself according to the categories. What possible mean- ing can we assign to the word creation, if we say that the Ab- solute creates Himself ? Nor is it more intelligible to say that the Absolute develops in time. Surely it is nonsense to say that first there was being, then nothing, then quantity, etc. All sorts of confusions arise because of Hegel's habitual use of metaphorical language. But it should be clear that he cannot mean in his dialectic to describe any merely temporal process or the way in which ordinary things do in fact change. He explicitly rejects what we today call evolution, that is, the transformation of organisms and species in time, and assures us that he is concerned with the concepts or ultimate categories of the Absolute. Now when he speaks of these cate- gories negating themselves or reflecting on themselves, exter- nalizing themselves or doing anything else, we cannot take him literally. Categories are not things changing in time. They are 5 See W. R. Smith, Lectures and Essays, Vol. I, chs. 2 and 5.</page><page sequence="6">288 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLI. logical relations. Thus being and non-being, for instance, cannot combine to form becoming. For it is of the essence of the dia- lectic to show that neither can have any separate existence. They cannot therefore be literally said to combine. What the dialectic can or does claim is that both are only abstract phases of any process in which some determinate being changes into something else. The method of showing this has been obscured for us by the loose use of the word contradiction or self-contradiction where Hegel means opposition. Strictly speaking, only propositions, not categories, can contradict each other. What Hegel does show is that such statements as " the total reality is pure being " and " the total reality is non-being" are equally true. For abstract being and non-being, taken by themselves, both exclude all determination and therefore cannot be distinguished from each other. They can be really distinguished only as phases of a process of becoming. But as such inseparable phases they are by no means entirely iden- tical any more than one side of a street is identical with the other because the phrase the other necessarily involves and has no mean- ing apart from the one. It is therefore sheer carelessness to speak of the dialectic as involving the identity of opposites. Opposing things have identical elements, but opposition is not identity. The real situation is clearly enough revealed in Hegel's criticism of the laws of identity and contradiction. He points out, as is well known, that if we assert the identity of A with itself, our proposi- tion involves some sort of distinction between the two A's identi- fied. This is obviously true if A is any object whatsoever. For then its identity involves at least difference in time. This how- ever does not mean that abstract identity and abstract difference are the same. It only means that they are always conjoined. Simlilarly Hegel points out that in the usual formulation of the principle of contradiction, nothing can be both A and not A, there is some element of identity between the A and the non-A-which again is obviously true if we speak as he and others do of "contradictory ", i.e., opposing things, qualities, or processes. 6 I may barely refer to my own view that all statements about the absolute totality contain an element of indetermination, and therefore seemingly opposed statements may not be really contradictory. See Contemporary American Phi- losophy, Vol. I, p. 233.</page><page sequence="7">No. 3.1 HEGEL'S RATIONALISM 289 Any dichotomous division into two mutually exclusive classes cer- tainly involves some resemblance or element of identity between the two. But the respect in which two classes exclude each other is not the same as the one in which they are identical. This prin- ciple of the inseparable conjunction of opposing categories such as identity and difference, immediacy and mediation, and the like, I have ventured to call the principle of polarity. To this principle no one has rendered greater service than Hegel: first, in the fruitful detection of opposing factors within seemingly simple entities or situations, and, secondly, in the subtle revelation of the inadequacy of treating one of two opposing factors as if it were absolutely independent. In this way we are saved from many false or inadequate alternatives. Also, all who wish to avoid the fallacy of reifying abstractions must agree with Hegel in denying them reality, i.e., if by reality we mean things in existence. But here a crude realism based on a prejudice in favor of existing things makes him deny the reality of abstractions in a way that deprives them of the validity which they have in their own do- main. This element of crude realism shows itself in his demand that the ideal prove itself efficient in the temporal realm, in op- position to the Platonic and Kantian view that sees reality in ideal validities extending beyond any actual thing. There is an oscil- lation from this realism to a violently monistic idealism, which hastily insists that all opposition is overcome and is consequently so hostile to the distinctions of the understanding as to have drawn on Hegel the charge of being the prince of confusionists. Clearly there can be no real unity without real difference, no real synthesis without real elements. Only by continuous use of metaphor does he avoid the necessity of drawing a clear distinction between purely logical and temporal relations, between categories and things categorized. At times, however, he cannot avoid assuming this distinction, as, for example, when he insists that philosophy is interested in the changes of concepts rather than in the changes of nature.7 These difficulties are rooted in the metaphysical assumption that thought is the sole reality in which everything is involved, so that everything can be evolved from it. All that truly exists is rational 7 Encyclopddie, ? 249.</page><page sequence="8">290 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VoL XLI. and nothing is opaque to thought because everything is the outcome of the power of mind as thought.8 Hegel's rationalism thus fol- lows from the idealism which he inherits from Kant's deduction of the categories and Fichte's doctrine that the ego creates its own object or non-ego. Hegel's argument is put in its clearest form in the first section of the Phenomenologie, in which the deliverance of sense-percep- tion is acutely analyzed and its certainty shown to depend not on our passivity to external influence, but on the activity of our thought. Everything then is rational because everything is deter- mined by the absolute mind whose real nature is self-conscious thought. But it is not at all necessary that rationalism should logically follow from what in our modern perverse terminology we call idealism and what should more properly be called monistic men- talism or spiritualism. The example of Schopenhauer serves to remind us that such idealism can take a voluntaristic form and glory in irrationalism. And this suggests the horrible thought-horrible to Schopenhauer, to Hegel, and to their respective followers-that the difference between them on certain fundamentals is largely linguistic. After all, the proposition that everything is mental is one that no one, no matter how realistic, need reject if its proponent will admit, as every sane person does, that there is a real or genuine difference between the loaf of bread which I merely have in mind and the loaf of bread which I buy and use to satisfy the hunger of my wife and children. If this distinction is admitted the resolution to apply the term mental to both of these entities, ordinarily referred to as an imaginary and as a real loaf, is only a resolution as to the use of words. The realist can object only on the ground of linguistic policy, that nothing but confusion is gained by thus arbitrarily stretching a word to cover the opposite of what we ordinarily and habitually suppose it to denote. If we decide to call everything that exists good then all evil things, like ignorance, suffering, and corruption, are good. But the differ- ence between them and the rarer things we used to call good remains, in fact, what it was before, except for the solace which 8 " Die wahrhafte Natur . . .ist . . .das Erzeugnis meines Geistes und zwar als denkenden Subjects ", Encyclopddie ? 23.</page><page sequence="9">No. 3.1 HEGEL'S RATIONALISM 291 the new vocabulary offers. This solace perhaps constitutes a large part of the human value of philosophy. But like other human values, it is purchased at a cost, in this case, of debasing our intellectual currency and wiping out clear distinctions so as to dull the edge of righteous indignation against established abuses. So, in regard to Hegel's rationalism, the assertion that every real is rational and every rational real is either a mere resolution to use these words synonymously, or else an undue narrowing of the word real and a stretching of the word rational to include the irrational. Do we not thus seem to eliminate the irrational only by incorporat- ing it into the essence of rationality itself ? We can see this more concretely in Hegel's philosophy of nature and philosophy of mind. II Unlike his English followers, Hegel regarded his philosophy of nature as central to his system. This can be seen by its prom- inence in his logic.9 How indeed can we have any systematic philosophy without an adequate account of the nature of the physical universe? We cannot reject the Hegelian physics with- out endangering his psychology, phenomenology, history, and other phases of objective mind which admittedly depend on physical factors. And if his method is completely rejected in the field of natural science, can we maintain it in the field of the humanistic sciences? But if we cannot reject his philosophy of nature without endangering his whole system, neither can we profitably dismiss it with the banal superficiality that the progress of science has left it behind. Heroic failures, the tragedies of intellectual adventure, are sometimes more instructive than petty successes. But as a fact, it is not true that the sterility of Hegel's philosophy of nature can be explained by the progress of science since his day. It is a great mistake to suppose that Hegel was not much in- terested nor versed in natural science. Even in his pre-university days, his father procured him a private tutor in geometry and astronomy. As a theological student he took courses in anatomy and other sciences. And when he lectured at Jena he avidly pur- 9 See the Preface to the first edition of his Logik and the treatment of the category of Objectivity. Note also the frequency with which examples from physics are used to illustrate the meaning of almost all the categories. 20</page><page sequence="10">292 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLI. sued diverse courses in natural science and gave lectures on mathe- matics, as well as on Naturphilosophie. He qualified as a member of several societies of naturalists by his active interests in miner- alogy, botany, and other fields. The result of these studies is seen on almost every page of the second part of the Encyclopddie, espe- cially in the Zusiitze. He had read the great masters of the differ- ent fields of physical science and the best authorities of his day- Kepler, Galileo, Newton, Lagrange, Berthollet, Bichat, Cuvier, et al.-and he brought a good deal of ingenuity to his task. Why then has his work in this field proved so utterly barren? The answer seems to me to be found in his rationalistic method. Hegel's primary interest, we must remember, was in the field of religion. He himself viewed his logic as giving us the succes- sive attributes of the Absolute or God, arranged in order of con- creteness. The God of his logic is the God before the creation of nature. His interest in nature is thus predominantly of the traditional theologico-anthropomorphic type.10 His attempt there- fore to explain nature in terms of his logic is an attempt to follow the divine order in the creation of nature, and this point was justly regarded as central by his disciple and editor Michelet. Without wishing to question the possibility of any mortal man being in possession of the secret of creation, it may be claimed that none of those who start from what they believe to be the divine idea of nature have thrown much light either on its details or on its general organization, and Hegel is no exception. The Copernican revolution and the general progress of modern mathe- matical and experimental methods in physics have really not af- fected him. He applies the old categories of teleology, of perfec- tion and the like, to natural objects like the sun and the earth,1' just as the scholastic philosophers did. The assumption that spirit creates nature does not help him to explain the nature of electricity, magnetism, and galvanism. Yet, these are precisely the topics that 10 For Hegel's early speculations on physics see Nohl's Hegels theologische Jugendschiften, pp. 227 ff. and 37I ff., and Haering's Hegel, Vol. I, pp. 200 ff., 255, 378 ff., and 700 ff. Haering ignores the fact that the mechanical inter- pretation of nature is an integral part of the idealistic or Neo-Platonic physics of Kepler, Galileo, Leibniz, Newton, and Kant. 11 " Die Erde ist unter allen Planeten die vortrefflichste ", etc., Werke, Vol. VII, p. 432.</page><page sequence="11">No. 3.1 HEGEL'S RATIONALISM 293 he deals with and must deal with if his philosophy of nature is to have any content. To be sure, he does rail against Schelling and others who try to deduce the facts of nature from a priori consid- erations.'2 But not all who denounce crime are themselves in- nocent. Certainly he does try to remove the contingency of such facts as that there are seven planets, four (sic) elements, three continents: Africa, Europe, and Asia (America and Australia do not count), or that there are three senses (the five are reduced to three). He does it by giving them a dialectic derivation in the Procrustean form of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.13 Now these are not mere lapses. They characterize his treatment of every topic and follow from his essential and fundamental as- sumption that thought is the one great reality in which everything else is involved, so that everything else can be evolved from it. This is fundamental not only to Hegel, but to the great tradition of which he is the culmination. Circumspect and cautious as is the critical Kant, the latter's doctrine that the laws of nature are cre- ated by the categories of the understanding is connected with the belief that we have a priori knowledge that nature follows Eu- clidean geometry and Newtonian mechanics. And so long as these truths are regarded as necessary, they cannot be derived from experience. But if we know a, priori that geometric and mechan- ical laws govern nature, why not a priori knowledge of electric, mechanical, and biologic laws? That is precisely the essence of the romantic Naturphilosophie. And Hegel, believing in the primacy and omnipotence of spirit, thinks of nature as its product. Of course, even an arch-romantic, like Schelling, admits that the self- consciousness which creates nature is the transcendental and not the empirical self. But the two are continuous, and all that is said about the transcendental self is in fact based on what we know of our empirical consciousness, so that the romantic philosophy of nature cannot escape anthropomorphism. Its rationalism is thus 12 For Schelling's criticism of Hegel's philosophy of nature see the appendix to Meyerson's De l'explication dans les sciences, and Dilthey's Schrif ten, Vol. IV, p. 275. 13 De Orbitis Planetarum and the Zusatz to ? 270 of the Encyclopidie (Werke, Vol. VII, pp. I20oI24), ?? 28I-285, ? 339 Zusatz, ?? 358.

XLI. romantic in the sense that it enthrones human wilfulness as the creator of nature. Hegel's Naturphilosophie proved itself much more sterile than that of Schelling precisely because it was much more rationalistic in relying on supposed a priori ideas rather than on the intuitions of genius. Schelling in some cases proved sug- gestive and stimulated research; Hegel defended ancient errors with perverse ingenuity. In theologic language, this may be put thus: the thought which creates nature is God's thought, not our frail human thought. Do we know God's thought through and through? Hegel's philo- sophy not only assumes it and insists on it, but pretends to give us a formula for the necessary laws according to which it must operate. If then his logic does not explain the contingent facts of nature, it fails to give us a concrete universal. This, in fact, he himself realizes when he admits that there are contingent facts in nature which cannot be derived from the idea. But with char- acteristic complacency or intellectual arrogance he puts the blame not on his method or assumptions, but on the facts of nature. Nature is not sufficiently strong or rational to conform to our con- cept of it. Hegel's philosophy of nature pretends to go beyond the em- pirical and mathematical results of natural science to deal with the idea of nature. But what is this idea? If we mean by it something that exists only in human thoughts, then since these thoughts, as temporal events, are connected with human bodies, ideas are only parts of nature. Our idea of the solar system is a psychologic product, the history of which belongs to the biogra- phy of various individuals and to the history of science, while the history of the solar system goes much farther back in time. If, however, Hegel uses the word idea (as he does) in the Platonic sense, as the form, or system, of nature itself, then so long as actual knowledge is capable of growth it can never be said to be adequate or equal to its object. The idea of nature then remains a formal or regulative ideal to guide or direct the process of in- creasing knowledge, but does not assure us knowledge of nature's substantial content. A philosophy of nature, therefore, must either be concerned with questions of pure logic, or else with existential propositions of physics, which never rise above the</page><page sequence="13">No. 3.] HEGEL'S RATIONALISM 295 realm of probability. Now, though Hegel is aware that philo- sophy must depend in some way on empirical material, his ration- alism will not allow him to recognize that a philosophy of nature must deal with probabilities. And his monism will not allow him to recognize the distinction between formal and material considerations as to nature. The limitation of Hegel's rationalism becomes clearer when we contrast it with that of Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. These founders of modern science can also be called rationalists. In line with the Platonic tradition in which they were brought up, they assumed that the book of nature was written in simple mathe- matical or geometric patterns. But they had the good sense of spiritual humility. They realized that to study the book of nature men must begin with the simplest elements and study their in- variant relations. The mechanical interpretation of nature is a product of this genuinely idealistic faith, that is, faith in universal laws which give a constant form to the changes of nature. The development of modern mathematical physics, such as the theory of relativity and statistical mechanics, and our greater insight into the nature of pure mathematics, show us more clearly the abstract form of these universal laws or forms of natural change. But we cannot deduce the concrete reality of natural fact from pure abstractions. Always there is the element of contingency, brute matter or vA-q. And if we deny the latter, our abstract forms collapse into nothingness. On the other hand, the failure of Hegel's Naturphilosophie does not justify the ideaphobia or misology of so-called scientific empiricism. For no progress in any field of science is possible without some assumption of greater rationality than we have at any point of time actually achieved. III While Hegel's thought has proved barren in the field of natural philosophy, it has had an enormous influence in the humanistic field. Shall we attribute this to the accident that some of his ideas have found favorable soil, or is there some one phase of his thought that has proved peculiarly fruitful? While the triune form of the dialectic is kept, it here becomes at times little more</page><page sequence="14">296 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLI. than a mannerism, which seems in no way to prevent him from expressing his very decided opinions, some of which have the penetration of genius and others of which are decidedly partizan, provincial, illiberal, and sectarian. If any example be needed, we may mention the grounds on which he favors war and disparages Kant's noble ideal of perpetual peace founded on a world federa- tion of republics (i.e., commonwealths governed by law), or the grounds on which he condemns Fries' appeal for popular partici- pation in government, his bigoted polemics against Catholicism, or the way he glorifies preference for Gothic art into an absolute. Any method which proves so many disputable propositions is rightly suspect. There are, however, those who insist that Hegel's whole logic is really the logic of the Geisteswissenschaften, as opposed to the logic of the Naturwissenschaf ten. This assumes that thought about human psychology, history, politics, art, or religious institu- tions, follows a logic different from that which concerns itself with natural objects. Such an assumption seems to me indefensible historically and logically, as well as inconsistent with all that Hegel says in his Logik, where illustrations from natural science abound. But, waiving this point, we may ask-what method, if any, has Hegel introduced into the mental and social sciences? The fol- lowers of Marx and others make a good deal of the dialectic as emphasizing inevitable opposition, or struggle, in the process of social change. But no one can well deny that wherever Hegel refers to strife and opposition he feels obliged to bring in some synthesis. This emphasis on the interdependence of conflicting factors is now generally called the organic point of view, as op- posed to the rationalistic or mechanical view, which is willing to trace the effects of abstract factors in their separation. Religion and laws, for instance, should be viewed not as artificially insti- tuted, but as integral to and expressive of the life of a people. Though this is an old view, admirably applied by men like Mon- tesquieu, there can be no doubt that Hegel gave great impetus to this method of approach. Thus Feuerbach integrated religion in anthropology, and other Hegelians, Vatke, Strauss, and C. Bauer, made it possible to view the religion of the Old and New Testa- ments as historic evolutions. But this organic method as devel-</page><page sequence="15">No. 3.] HEGEL'S RATIONALISM 297 oped by Hegel is an unstable concept and oscillates between crude realism and abstract rationalism. Emphasis on historic setting and continuity with the past has in him, as in Savigny and in others, discouraged ethical idealism and made for an historical relativism which led to the idolatry of the actual. But the inherent absolutism of his thought asserts itself in taking the political element of life, the State, and setting it up as the Absolute, the God on earth, to the neglect of individual and international rights. The same tendency to abstract rationalism shows itself even more clearly in the attempt to write history in terms of periods which succeed each other according to a linear series of abstract ideas connected with each other by a decidedly abstract and mechanistic logic. Here again, his failure to distinguish between formal and material considerations, and his unwillingness to be satisfied with the most probable results, make a real synthesis impossible and make him oscillate between crude realism and abstract ration- alism. Let us look at this somewhat more closely. In ethics, Hegel opposes the abstract morality of individual conscience. Not the abstract good will of Kant, ruled by abstract laws or imperatives, but the concrete social good, determines our actual duties and proper lines of conduct in family, social, and political affairs. But he falls into vicious abstraction himself through his absolutism. For the glorification of the State im- poverishes the positive content of his idea of the concrete social good. And his contempt for empirical facts, such as the approxi- mate equality of the number of men and women, makes his discussions lack reality. In the field of jurisprudence, Hegel's rationalism clings to con- cepts that do not advance the analysis of actual problems. This is true of his theory that property is the realization of the will or of freedom of personality. As my property-right in any object necessarily limits the rights and freedom of everyone else, the real problems of the law of property are not adequately met by the notion of freedom alone. We need some theory as to how this freedom is to be properly limited, and this Hegel does not offer because of insufficient attention to the empirical content of law. Similarly, there is a verbal nobility to his theory that punishment</page><page sequence="16">298 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLL carries into effect the will of the criminal, but it throws no light on what punishment is the suitable one in any given case, nor what offenses should be treated with the mercy of the pardoning power, nor how society is to defend itself against dangerous aggression by those who defy its laws. Since, according to Hegel, ethics is embodied in the State, and there is no sovereign over all states, they are, in relation to each other, in a state of nature, not subject to moral laws. They are thus not obliged to keep their agreements. From this anarchic and amoralistic view of international relations he tries to escape by regarding history as the court in which Providence passes judg- ment on the various nations. This seems to make history a theo- dicy; but it also makes mere survival the test of national right- eousness-a doctrine that misses the pathos and tragedy of history and is equivalent to Napoleon's dictum that God is on the side of the heaviest artillery. What does Hegel's rationalism mean in the realm of history? Let us consider it first in the domain with which we are all pre- sumably more or less familiar, namely, in the history of philosophy. No one can read the pre-Hegelian histories of philosophy, such as those of Brucker, Buhle, or Tennemann, without feeling a lack of general significance. They give us only the lives and opinions of diverse philosophers in chronologic order, which rationally seems hardly more significant than the alphabetic order. But Hegel for the first time gives us a coherent history of philosophy itself. In it there seems nothing contingent or accidental. The time-order as well as the content of the different philosophies seems dictated by some logical order (though not necessarily that of the cate- gories in the Science of Logic). Every philosophy is viewed as a development of or an antithesis (now called reaction) to the previous one. This has brought about an almost complete revolu- tion in our subject-matter. Indeed, I know of no other single book that has so completely revolutionized a field of human study. The massive philologic equipment of Zeller, the imposing if somewhat superficial historic learning of Kuno Fischer, and the ingenious schematism of Erdmann and Windelband, are all dom- inated by the Hegelian conception and seem to have fixed it as the canonical view of the history of philosophy.</page><page sequence="17">No. 3.1 HEGEL'S RATIONALISM 299 And yet without wishing to return to the former blind and in- sipid empiricism, or to ignore the great wealth of insight which the Hegelian method has brought us, we may well deny that the contingent or accidental element has really been, or can be, elim- inated from the history of philosophy. No one has in fact ever shown any logical necessity why Parmenides, Plato, and Aris- totle should have appeared and thought as they did, or why they should have been followed by such men as Zeno and Epi- curus, and these by still smaller men, until suddenly the great figure of Plotinus rises from the Egyptian sands. Why, when the ab- solute attained complete self-consciousness in the philosophy of Hegel, did his followers divide into such discordant groups? His method really assumes that the latest in time is the fullest and nearest to perfection. But if chronology were the test of truth the materialistic Feuerbach or Karl Marx would be an improve- ment on the idealistic Hegel. In point of fact, however, Hegel's philosophy of mathematics cannot be compared favorably with that of his despised contemporary Fries, or even with that of his prede- cessor Kant. No! Men and their idiosyncracies, the inexplicable but powerful idiosyncracies of genius, cannot be eliminated from the history of philosophy any more than individual genius can be eliminated from the history of poetry or any other art. It is generally easy to explain events after they have happened. For our explanations can seldom be checked by experimental verifica- tion, and so are in fact not challenged. Any explanation which seems plausible a priori can hold the field. But to impose a com- pletely logical or rational order on the history of philosophy is to do violence to the obvious facts in history. If individual men with their inexplicable individual peculiarities are ignored, what is left is not the history of the actual concrete reality but at best an abstract phase of it. This abstract phase is illuminating and im- portant, but it cannot be recognized except as abstract. Those who believe in the reality of abstract universals may be pardoned a bit of ironic glee in seeing what little there is left of Hegel's con- crete universal in the field of the history of philosophy. If in the history of art, religion, and philosophy, Hegel sins by leaving out individual men and their inexplicable traits, he sins even more grievously in the philosophy of history by identifying</page><page sequence="18">300 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VoiL. XLI. the universal absolute spirit with local contingencies such as the Prussian monarchy. Why must the absolute, as Hegel insists, incarnate himself in only one nation at a time so that others have no rights against it? Why should monarchy, even if the mon- arch lacks wisdom and good will, be the embodiment of eternal reason? Hegel naively asserts that Frederick II was the first sovereign who kept the general interests of the state steadily in view-which unduly flattering judgment of Frederick can cer- tainly not be an argument for the absolute rationality of monarchy. Why must the absolute reason express itself in the acts of govern- ment-appointed officials rather than in the deliberation of pop- ularly chosen representatives? There may be empirical wisdom in preferring one to the other under certain conditions, but the totality of such conditions of human life is never fully known to us. Hence it is dangerous for a philosopher to speak in the name of the absolute on such matters as the English reform bill, on which history has mocked Hegel's analysis and predictions. This again is saying that in the field of spirit as in the field of nature he makes no room for the weighing of probabilities. Where every- thing is the manifestation of the absolute the weighing of prob- abilities by applying mathematics to hypotheses that have no sup- port except harmony with past experience is out of the question; yet that is the best wisdom that imperfect man can achieve. IV Historically Hegel's philosophy may be viewed as a synthesis of the romantic movement which had its sources in Protestantism, Rousseau, Kant, Fichte, and Schelling, and of the rationalism of the eighteenth century which had its roots in classical antiquity, of which Hegel was always a keen student. His bureaucratic ante- cedents and temper made him emphasize the values of order and renew the Aristotelian conception of the state in a somewhat non- Hellenic and illiberal way. But his fundamental logic is essen- tially romantic in the sense that the cosmic order is conceived of in an anthropomorphic manner subservient to the accidents of human volition. Classic wisdom as well as more ancient religion demand discipline of spirit and the recognition of a cosmic order greater than that which we can create or even completely under-</page><page sequence="19">No. 3.] HEGEL'S RATIONALISM 30I stand. Hegel is one of the most significant figures in philosophy because he faced this dilemma of the human spirit, how to find a via media between romanticism and rationalism, between capricious anarchy and despotism. But the history of his immediate fol- lowers shows that he did not adequately solve his problem. Hegel was profoundly impressed with the Heraclitean flux. More than any other philosopher since Heraclitus he realized the element of strife or opposition within the flux, but his monistic absolute idealism made him too ready and hasty to find solutions or reconciliations. At times he recognizes the reality of oppo- sition and insists that it is not removed when two opposites are seen to be parts or phases of a larger unity. But his traditional loyalties defeat this realistic vision and he does all too frequently speak as if formal unity wipes out conflict and disharmony. But the fact that two opponents are at each other's throats, which they could not be if they were entirely separated, does not elevate their struggle to a higher unity. The word higher is here as almost anywhere else a snare and a delusion covering the absence of meaning with a vague afflatus. In fact, the unity of opposites is just another name for the brute fact that there is real opposition. Multiplicity and struggle, finitude and evil, contingency and im- perfection, are as primary or real as anything else, and cannot be rationally deduced from or wiped out by any monistic absolute idea. The aphorism that the real is rational and that the rational is real either rests on arbitrary definitions of real and rational or else it is a philosophically fatal falsehood. Unfortunately it satis- fies human vanity and persists by perpetually shifting from one meaning to another. Philosophy always has been and must con- tinue to be a search for a rational order in the chaos of empirical happenings. And Hegel has rendered great service in showing the untenability and self-contradiction of pure empiricism. But ration- alism can succeed only by being humble and recognizing its own difficulties or limitations. It must admit that rational order is only one phase of a world which always contains more than we can possibly explain. Intellectual arrogance is a spiritual blindness fatal to the life of true philosophy. MoRRis R. COHEN COLLEGE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK</page></plain_text>
