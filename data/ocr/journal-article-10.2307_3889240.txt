The upper therianthropic figure is argued to conflate human and tadpole features (Lewis-Williams &amp; Pearce 2004). It strikes with a short stick the horns of a legless anthropomorphic figure that in turn strikes the horns of a coiled, antelope headed snake. The importance of horns is emphasised by the isolated, painting of unattached eland horns between the two upper figures. More depictions of unattached horns are found in other parts of the panel. Note the nasal blood smeared over the faces of the two upper figures and the flywhisks they canry. (Traced: David Pearce; redrawn: Wendy Voorvelt) Reference Lewis-Williams, J. D. and Pearce, D.
