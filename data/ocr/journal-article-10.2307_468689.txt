<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Epiphanic Mode in Wordsworth and Modern Literature Robert Langbaum TW v IHEN Hazlitt in The Spirit of the Age said that Wordsworth had made poetry democratic, had taken it off stilts, he put his finger on Wordsworth's essential contribution to modern poetry. "Mr. Wordsworth's genius," says Hazlitt speaking with the authority of a contemporary, is a pure emanation of the Spirit of the Age. Had he lived in any other period of the world, he would never have been heard of.... His homely Muse can hardly raise her wing from the ground.... He has "no figures nor no fan- tasies," . . . neither the gorgeous machinery of mythologic lore, nor the splen- did colors of poetic diction. His style is vernacular: he delivers household truths. He sees nothing loftier than human hopes; nothing deeper than the human heart.... He takes the simplest elements of nature and of the human mind, ... and tries to compound a new system of poetry from them. "It is," Hazlitt comments, "one of the innovations of the time. It par- takes of, and is carried along with," he says thinking of the French Revolution, the revolutionary movement of our age: the political changes of the day were the model on which he formed and conducted his poetical experiments. His Muse ... is a levelling one. It proceeds on a principle of equality, and strives to reduce all things to the same standard. It is distinguished by a proud humil- ity.... Hence the unaccountable mixture of seeming simplicity and real abstruseness in the Lyrical Ballads. Fools have laughed at, wise men scarcely understand them.' Hazlitt explains the innovations of Lyrical Ballads-the point of which, as indicated in the Preface, is this: that poetry is not deter- mined by a formal structure, by meter or rhyme, nor by a special kind of subject matter and language. Poetry, in other words, is not deter- mined by external signs but by a kind of mental operation that Wordsworth and Coleridge called "imagination." Imagination is democratic because it can turn any subject matter poetic through</page><page sequence="2">NEW LITERARY HISTORY intensification and transformation. Imagination operates best through a plain style that allows intensification to take place, that does not rely on the artificial elevation of rhetoric. It operates best on realistic material that requires transformation, and helps us believe that the transformation really does take place. What we have here is a magic realism-the natural supernaturalism of the plan according to which Wordsworth and Coleridge cooperated on Lyrical Ballads. According to the plan as Coleridge describes it in Biographia Literaria (ch. 14), Wordsworth was to choose subjects from "ordinary life" and excite in us "a feeling analogous to the super- natural" by lifting "the film of familiarity" from our eyes. Coleridge was to start with supernatural or partly supernatural incidents or characters and make them seem natural through the psychological truth of the emotions involved. The final effect of both kinds of poems would be both natural and supernatural or, in other words, imaginative. The plan for Lyrical Ballads suggests that imagination operates most obviously and effectively within a new realistic mode that Wordsworth in The Prelude called "spots of time" and that Joyce a century later called "epiphanies." I take over Joyce's term in order to show the long-range significance of Wordsworth's innovation, which has in- fluenced not only poetry but also modern fiction, especially the modern short story. My purpose is not merely to show that epiphanies exist in Romantic and modern literature. I argued this in The Poetry of Experience (1957), and the connection is by now generally accept- ed-see, for example, Morris Beja, Epiphany in the Modern Novel (1971), and M. H. Abrams, Natural Supernaturalism (1971, pp. 385-427). My purpose is to do what has not yet been done: to exam- ine the structure of epiphany, to analyze the ways in which the various kinds of epiphany operate so as to distinguish modern epiphany from traditional vision, and to show how epiphany as a necessary concomi- tant of realism determines the structure of many Romantic and modern poems and fictions. My analysis will suggest that the epiphanic mode is to a large extent the Romantic and modern mode-a dominant modern convention. An epiphany is the manifestation of a god, or of spirit in body. The Christian Epiphany is the manifestation of Christ to the Magi. In a letter of 1904, Joyce uses the analogous term epicleti to explain the liturgical origin of his own magic realism. His projected volume of short stories Dubliners is, he writes, "a series of epicleti," an error for epicleses, an invocation in the Greek Orthodox mass that the Holy Ghost transform the host into the body of Christ. Joyce further ex- plains epiphany by saying that his method is to give "my idea of the 336</page><page sequence="3">THE EPIPHANIC MODE IN WORDSWORTH AND MODERN LITERATURE 337 significance of trivial things."2 In the autobiographical novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Stephen resents the fact that his girlfriend reveals her soul to a priest of the Church rather than to him, "a priest of eternal imagination, transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everliving life."3 By way of epiphany, Joyce goes farther than even Pater and Yeats in articulating the religion of art. Pater and Yeats use art to bring us back to religion or mysticism, but Joyce establishes art as a rival religion. In Stephen Hero, the first draft of Portrait, Joyce makes even clearer the connection of the term epiphany with the innovativeness of his fiction. We are told how Stephen heard in the street one evening a "fragment of colloquy out of which he received an impression keen enough to afflict his sensitiveness very severely.... This triviality made him think of collecting many such moments together in a book of epiphanies."4 Joyce actually did make such a collection, which Stephen Dedalus remembers in Ulysses as his "epiphanies . . . deeply deep."5 The forty manuscript epiphanies so far known have been published in The Workshop of Daedalus, edited by Robert Scholes and Richard M. Kain. In his introduction to the epiphanies, Scholes says that for Joyce "Epiphany" referred "to life only, not to art. An Epiphany was life observed.... [it] could not be constructed, only recorded." Scholes suggests that the term is inapplicable to Dubliners, since no "known Epiphany has been discovered in that collection of stories."6 My quo- tations above show that Joyce himself applied the concept of epiphany to Dubliners, and Scholes contradicts himself by indicating in his notes to the epiphanies how carefully Joyce wrought them for a specific effect. Like all Romantic artists, Joyce dissolves the distinction be- tween life and art: the epiphany occurs in the author's life, and the author expends art to make it occur in the reader's life. Besides, not all Joyce's epiphanies are notations of objective details; some, especially the so-called dream epiphanies, are prose poems. In Stephen Hero, Joyce distinguishes two kinds of epiphany. "By an epiphany," Stephen "meant a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether in the vulgarity of speech or of gesture or in a memorable phase of the mind itself. He believed that it was for the man of letters to record these epiphanies with extreme care, seeing that they themselves are the most delicate and evanescent of moments" (p. 211, my italics). The epiphany reveals spirit, and breaks-whether, as in the plan for Lyri- cal Ballads, we start with fact or a phase of the mind-suddenly, in a moment of insight, upon a sensitive observer and through him upon the reader. In art, epiphany is something that happens to the reader. The truth is that most of Joyce's notebook epiphanies are the raw</page><page sequence="4">NEW LITERARY HISTORY material of epiphanies, requiring a context to produce in the reader the turn of mind that would make them manifestations of spirit. None of the notebook epiphanies is so perfect an example of the type as the epiphany that ends "The Dead" in Dubliners. The fully developed epiphanies usually combine "the vulgarity of speech or of gesture" with "a memorable phase of the mind"-the former producing the latter. The combination is expressed by Stephen's remark in Ulysses, "That is God.... A shout in the street" (p. 34). At the end of "The Dead," Gabriel transforms the evening's scraps of conversation and of his own thoughts-just such scraps as appear in the notebook epiphanies-into a vision of snow falling all over Ireland, upon the dead. Epiphany would seem to be an inevitable concomitant of realis- tic fiction and poetry. For if realistic notation is to become art, the reader must be relied on to transform the details into visionary significance-a visionary significance that cannot be stated as a meaning. When the transformation does not come off, it is because the author has not supplied the necessary structure for transforma- tion. I shall examine that structure later, especially in connection with Wordsworth. Let us return to the scrap of dialogue in Stephen Hero, which gave Stephen the idea of "collecting many such moments together in a book of epiphanies." The Young Lady-(drawling discreetly) ... 0, yes ... I was ... at the ... cha ... pel ... The Young Gentleman-(inaudibly) ... I ... (again in- audibly) ... I ... The Young Lady-(softly) ... O ... but you're ... ve... ry... wick... ed ... (P. 211) It is easy to understand through the whisperings and innuendoes the nature of the young couple's relation. But haven't fiction writers and dramatists always operated through such characterizing dialogue? The relatively new thing for fiction is this: that the dialogue has significance only because it registers upon Stephen, who, when he hears it, is disapproving of the combination in his girlfriend of sexual suggestiveness and elusiveness, just the qualities of the lady in the dialogue. It is the sensitized condition of the observer that brings on epiphany, and the art of epiphany consists in establishing this sen- sitized condition. For epiphany offers an insight into the observer as well as into the object observed. Stephen, we are told in Portrait, "wanted to meet in the real world the unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld" (p. 65). The Stephen of Stephen Hero says that he could pass the clock of the Ballast Office "time after time, 338</page><page sequence="5">THE EPIPHANIC MODE IN WORDSWORTH AND MODERN LITERATURE 339 allude to it, refer to it, catch a glimpse of it. It is only an item in the catalogue of Dublin's street furniture. Then all at once I see it and I know at once what it is: epiphany" (p. 211, my italics). The difference between habitual and epiphanic seeing is the essence of Wordsworth's art, as is the momentaneousness of the epiphanic experience. Joyce is usually considered the first to use the theological term epiphany to denote a psychological and literary mode of perception. But Emerson in 1838 gives the term the same psychological meaning, even showing how epiphany rises out of vulgar fact: "Day creeps after day, each full of facts, dull, strange, despised things..... presently the aroused intellect finds gold and gems in one of these scorned facts, then finds ... that a fact is an Epiphany of God."7 Wordsworth refers to this mode of perception in life and art as "spots of time" (Prelude, Bk. XII, 1. 208), and many writers since Wordsworth have spoken of such privileged moments. The most famous statement is that of Pater, who in the Conclusion to The Renaissance says that the multiplication of privileged moments ought to be the purpose of life and that art is the surest source of such moments: "For art comes to you proposing frankly to give nothing but the highest quality to your moments as they pass, and simply for those moments' sake." Dissolving the dis- tinction between life and art, Pater sees epiphany as both encapsu- lated in the work of art and as taking place in the beholder of art. The epiphanic mode has pervaded poetry and determined its structure since Wordsworth. It shapes the Victorian dramatic monologue, which is an epiphany of character and a slice-of-life in just the manner of the modern short story, which appeared soon after the dramatic monologue. The epiphanic mode determines such Modernist forms as Imagism and Symbolism. "One is trying," says Pound in defining the Imagist poem, "to record the precise instant when a thing outward and objective transforms itself, or darts into a thing inward and subjective."8 Stevens's "freed man" is freed from doctrine by epiphany: It was how the sun came shining into his room: To be without a description of to be, For a moment on rising, at the edge of the bed, to be, It was everything being more real, himself At the centre of reality, seeing it. It was everything bulging and blazing and big in itself. ("The Latest Freed Man") But in Stevens and other Modernists like Beckett, epiphanies are sometimes negative-insights into the abyss. In "The Snow Man,"</page><page sequence="6">NEW LITERARY HISTORY Stevens achieves a negative epiphany by reversing Wordsworth's idea that mind and nature are admirably suited to each other. "One must have a mind of winter," says Stevens, one must have not a human mind but the mindless mind of a snow man, to be the listener, who listens in the snow, And, nothing himself, beholds Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.9 Joyce's epiphany of snow in "The Dead" is, by contrast, Romantically vital. With very few exceptions the epiphanic mode does not appear in fiction until the turn of the century with James, Conrad, Proust and with the development of the modern short story by Chekhov, Joyce, Lawrence. James writes of the "imaginative" mind as able to convert "the very pulses of the air into revelations." Conrad's Marlow speaks in Lord Jim of "one of these rare moments of awakening when we see, hear, understand ever so much-everything-in a flash-before we fall back again into our agreeable somnolence." Virginia Woolf speaks of the novelist's art as the attempt "to reconstruct ... in words" the moment when "a tree shook; an electric light danced; ... a whole vision ... seemed contained in that moment." Faulkner believes that the novelist's "craft" is "to arrest for a believable moment" the experi- ence of life. Fitzgerald writes that what he, Wolfe, and Hemingway have in common is their attempt "to recapture the exact feel of a moment in time and space," an attempt he associates with "what Wordsworth was trying to do."'0 The most thorough practitioner in fiction of the epiphanic mode is Proust, whose vast novel A la Recherche du temps perdu is built upon moments of what Proust calls "involuntary Memory," moments in which the past returns and overwhelms the present. Proust's epiphanies are closest to Wordsworth's in that they are mainly delayed epiphanies, epiphanies of recollection, moments triggered by a pres- ent event and occurring after the original experience, which was not itself an epiphany. The psychological association between present and past events causes the original experience to return as a delayed epiphany-a moment of recollection in which spatial reality is dema- terialized through the free-floating perspective of time. Proust suggests that only the absent can be imagined; and Wordsworth says many times in The Prelude that only the "unremembered," which is to say the unconsciously remembered, can be remembered in a way that counts imaginatively. Proust's epiphanies are like Wordsworth's in that they operate through carefully delineated psychological associa- 340</page><page sequence="7">THE EPIPHANIC MODE IN WORDSWORTH AND MODERN LITERATURE 341 tion. Realism and psychology make epiphany a modern mode as dis- tinguished from traditional vision. The concept of epiphany is useful only to the extent that we recog- nize epiphany as distinctively modern. Otherwise we may as well scrap the term and speak only of vision. I insist that we need the term to understand one line of innovation in nineteenth- and twentieth- century literature. In order to understand epiphany, we must realize that Vaughan's seventeenth-century lines, "I saw eternity the other night / Like a great ring of pure and endless light" (in "The World"), make a statement about vision not epiphany, because nothing is phys- ically sensed-eternity is merely likened to a ring of light. The open- ing lines of Blake's "Auguries of Innocence," instead, make a state- ment about epiphany because there are physically sensed objects: "To see a World in a Grain of Sand / And a Heaven in a Wild Flower, / Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand." But we need to make still another distinction between Blake, who makes statements about epiphany, and his younger contemporaries Wordsworth and Col- eridge, who create structures that produce epiphanies in the reader. In his excellent book Epiphany in the Modern Novel, Morris Beja distinguishes modern epiphany from traditional vision by two criteria: the Criterion of Incongruity-the epiphany is irrelevant to the object or incident that triggers it-and the Criterion of Insignificance-the epiphany is triggered by a trivial object or inci- dent. Dante in his vision at the end of Paradiso "sees God in all His magnificence," but the modern epiphany, says Beja, is out of propor- tion to its cause (pp. 16-17). I would add four more criteria. The first is the Criterion of Psychological Association: the epiphany is not an incursion of God from outside; it is a psychological phenomenon arising from a real sensuous experience, either present or recollected. The second is the Criterion of Momentaneousness: the epiphany lasts only a moment, but leaves an enduring effect. The third is the Criterion of Sudden- ness: a sudden change in external conditions causes a shift in sensu- ous perception that sensitizes the observer for epiphany. The fourth is the Criterion of Fragmentation or the Epiphanic Leap: the text never quite equals the epiphany; the poetry, as Browning put it, con- sists in the reader's leap.1l Hence the deliberate fragmentation of Modernist literature, which blocks grammatical or logical organiza- tion in order to enforce psychological organization. All these criteria, Beja's and mine, are illustrated by the epiphany at the end of "The Dead," when suddenly: "A few light taps upon the pane made him [Gabriel] turn to the window. It had begun,to snow again."</page><page sequence="8">NEW LITERARY HISTORY All these criteria are strikingly illustrated by Wordsworth's Lucy poem "Strange Fits of Passion Have I Known." The narrator, Lucy's lover, is riding horseback to her cottage. He keeps his eyes fixed on the moon, and this fixity, together with the regularity of the horse's hoofbeats, throws him into a kind of hypnotic trance which prepares him for epiphany. It is, however, the sudden disruption of this pat- tern, the sudden dropping and disappearance of the moon behind Lucy's roof that wakes him out of his sweet dream and makes him suddenly associate the disappearance of the moon with the possibility of Lucy's death. Here are the last three stanzas. In one of those sweet dreams I slept, Kind Nature's gentlest boon! And all the while my eyes I kept On the descending moon. My horse moved on; hoof after hoof He raised, and never stopped: When down behind the cottage roof, At once, the bright moon dropped. (LI. 17-24) "What fond and wayward thoughts," he says-and "fond" has its older meaning mad as well as its newer meaning affectionate- What fond and wayward thoughts will slide Into a Lover's head! "O mercy!" to myself I cried, "If Lucy should be dead!"12 (Ll. 25-28) In the first stanza, the narrator calls this epiphany a strange fit of passion which he will confide to "the Lover's ear alone"; for emotional predisposition is required if the reader is to make the epiphanic leap. Wordsworth often specifies the kind of reader he requires, for the epiphanic poem is a joint venture of poet and reader. Note that the narrator's sweet dream is a trance or waking dream. Dreams proper cannot, for the most part, be fitted into a workable definition of epiphany-unless, like dreams in the opening pages of Proust's Swann's Way, they arise from physical sensations or body positions. Wordsworth's dream of the Arab in The Prelude, Book V arises from experience-the sight of the sea and the reading of Don Quixote-but the dream is too drawn out and allegorical to be epiphanic. Epiphany is the opposite of allegory, conceit, metaphor; it really happens. Joyce's so-called dream epiphanies in the notebook 342</page><page sequence="9">THE EPIPHANIC MODE IN WORDSWORTH AND MODERN LITERATURE 343 raise problems for his own definition of epiphany; for in defining the term for life or art, Joyce never takes dreams into account. Nor is it certain that all the epiphanies which, in his transcription of his brother's epiphanies, Stanislaus Joyce calls dreams really are dreams; some could just as easily be understood as imaginatively perceived reality. Number 8: "Where three roads meet and before a swampy beach a big dog is recumbent.. ." appears as a real incident in Stephen Hero; while number 32: "The human crowd swarms in the enclosure, moving through the slush.... A little old man has mice on an um- brella.... A beautiful brown horse, with a yellow rider upon him, flashes far away in the sunlight" is less imaginative than the epiphany in Portrait, certainly not a dream, where a girl bathing in the sea appears to Stephen as a mythological bird-girl.13 When Joyce in Stephen Hero applies the concept of epiphany to art, we realize that an epiphanic art is object-oriented and therefore static and lyrical rather than moving and dramatic. It is significant that the epiphanic mode begins with the Romantic poets, for whom lyric be- comes the dominant genre. It is also significant that the epiphanic mode appears in fiction at just the time when fiction begins to ap- proximate the intensity of the lyric. "'The third quality,"' says Stephen, "'is the moment which I call epiphany,'" when" 'we recog- nize that the object ... is that thing which it is. Its soul, its whatness, leaps to us from the vestment of its appearance. The soul of the com- monest object, the structure of which is so adjusted, seems to us radiant. The object achieves its epiphany'" (p. 213). Note the combi- nation of realism with radiance and the suggestion that the radiance is produced by a structure. In revising this passage for Portrait, Joyce omitted the word "epiphany"; but he clearly had epiphany in mind, for he makes Stephen say that the object is "'that thing which it is and no other thing."' He also expands the notion of "radiance": it is the intensifica- tion of the object's realistic quality, its "whatness," as revealed in an instant: "'The instant wherein that supreme quality of beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic image, is apprehended luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmony in the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure"' (p. 213). Note how difficult it is to distinguish the radiance of the object from the luminousness of the mind that beholds it. That is because the ob- ject's radiance is its inwardness, which is to say the beholder's inward- ness projected into it. The object is beheld at that point of intensity where it becomes an equivocally subjective-objective image. The word "stasis" refers to the reader's response; but we can infer from it the structure that produces such response, and that structure is, I would</page><page sequence="10">NEW LITERARY HISTORY suggest, lyrical. For the epiphanic story or poem (even when the poem is narrative) is devoted to intensifying an object into radiance rather than to telling a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Even narrative, in other words, is lyricized and rendered relatively static. The Wordsworth poem I have just discussed is a good example of lyricized narrative; there is very little linear movement, just enough to prepare for the epiphanic final stanza. In the Victorian dramatic monologue, we see how drama is lyricized. Very little happens; there are no reversals; there is simply the static intensification of character. Joyce's Ulysses is the most con- spicuous example of lyrical stasis in fiction. For such a big novel very little happens. There is very little linear movement, either spatial or temporal. The whole gigantic novel takes place in Dublin during twenty-four hours. Someone is buried; someone is born; Molly Bloom commits adultery without any consequences; Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom meet and part. The novel's movement is mainly in depth; vast reaches of time converge in a limited present. Virginia Woolf's novels follow the same pattern; The Waves is an extreme example of the static lyrical novel. My idea of lyrical stasis is supported by the pregnant metaphor "spatial form" advanced by Joseph Frank in his influential essay "Spatial Form in Modern Literature." Frank considers spatial form the distinguishing sign of twentieth-century Modernist literature. We apprehend spatial form, Frank argues, by piecing together a deliber- ately fragmented modern work as though the parts existed simulta- neously: "The meaning-relationship is completed only by the simul- taneous perception in space of word-groups that have no com- prehensible relation to each other when read consecutively in time.... Modern poetry asks its readers to suspend the process of individual reference temporarily until the entire pattern of internal references can be apprehended as a unity"-as, in my terms, a static retrospective flash. "The reader," says Frank, "is forced to read Ulysses in exactly the same manner as he reads modern poetry, that is, by continually fitting fragments together and keeping allusions in mind until, by reflexive reference, he can link them to their comple- ments.... Joyce cannot be read-he can only be reread." Frank's persuasive argument would be even stronger if he employed the concepts of epiphany and lyrical stasis; for he would then realize that the phenomenon he is describing is not distinctively twentieth-century but begins in English literature with Wordsworth. In his recent essay "Spatial Form: Some Further Reflections," Frank says he has learned from the structuralists that "the emergence of spatial form in twentieth-century narrative should no longer be regarded as a radical 344</page><page sequence="11">THE EPIPHANIC MODE IN WORDSWORTH AND MODERN LITERATURE 345 break with tradition. Rather, it represents only what Jakobson would call a shift in the internal hierarchy of the elements ["causal- chronological" versus "spatial"] composing a narrative structure."14 Frank still does not see that Romanticism caused the shift; he there- fore cannot account for the shift, cannot see that it derives from a changed world view that values experience over system, whether the system be causal-chronological, logical, theological, or ethical. If we take as models of the modern short story Joyce's stories in Dubliners, as well as Chekhov's stories, we see that the modern short story is plotless and apparently pointless in order that it may be epiphanic. Once we realize this, we can understand that one origin of the modern short story is in Lyrical Ballads, in the plotless and appar- ently pointless story, for example, of Simon Lee. This is a poem about a tall, vigorous huntsman who is so reduced by poverty and old age that he is too weak to work the "scrap of land" left to him. The poem tells a realistic story about old age and the passing of the feudal economy that could support liveried huntsmen. In strikingly realistic detail, we are told that Simon's "body, dwindled and awry, / Rests upon ankles swoln and thick." In the end the narrator sees him trying in vain "To unearth the root of an old tree," and taking Simon's mattock cuts the root for him. The old man's eyes fill with tears of gratitude, a gratitude that leaves the narrator "mourning." For Si- mon's tears are an epiphany of his reduced condition. I am reminded of Joyce's story "Clay" (in Dubliners), where in the end Joe's eyes fill with tears when Maria, the poor, old, ugly, unmar- ried servant to servants, sings, all oblivious of her condition, "I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls." Wordsworth has, in Joyce's phrase, merely traced "the curve of an emotion." But in doing so, in getting the appearance just right, he has worked a transformation; he has made the appearance yield its radiance or essence, the essence of a whole life or condition-the condition, as in "Clay," of old age and poverty. The epiphany registers, however, not on Joyce's Maria or on Wordsworth's Simon but on the beholder and, through him, on the reader. This "is no tale," says Wordsworth, once again enlisting the reader's cooperation, "but should you [the reader] think, / Perhaps a tale you'll make it." The tale does not reside in the events but in the quality of the imagination that produced it and that receives it. The author does not tell the reader the story, but plays upon him as though he were a musical instrument-making him move through a series of associations that will produce the epiphany in him. "The feeling therein developed," says Wordsworth in the Preface to Lyrical Ballads,</page><page sequence="12">NEW LITERARY HISTORY "gives importance to the action and situation, and not the action and situation to the feeling." Wordsworth reverses Aristotle's prescription for the primacy of action. He lyricizes narrative and gives lyric a narrative form: hence lyrical ballads. No wonder Joyce wrote: "I think Wordsworth of all English men of letters best deserves your word 'genius.'"15 So far I have concentrated on short poems and stories where the epiphany occurs at the end, reordering and rendering static all that has preceded. In longer poems and in novels, epiphanies occur suc- cessively, reordering the parts backwards and forwards in the direc- tion of lyrical stasis. In Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse, epiphanies reduce the action to a series of still, silent moments that give the text a fragmented quality. Mrs. Ramsay, stopping her knitting, has an epiphanic vision of "the steady [i.e., still] light" from the lighthouse; and her stillness breaks upon Mr. Ramsay as an epiphany: "He turned and saw her. Ah! She was lovely." Mrs. Ramsay suddenly sees her dinner party as a static moment, rising, despite the talk, "in this pro- found stillness.... Of such moments, she thought, the thing is made that endures." Lily Briscoe, the painter, arrives at a theory of epiphany by asking: "What is the meaning of life?... The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark." Mrs. Ramsay unconsciously does in life what Lily necessarily does in painting and what Virginia Woolf chooses to do in this novel: they give meaning to life by spatializing and silencing it, while suggesting its noisy movement. "Beauty," Lily thinks, "stilled life-froze it." Lily reduces to stasis even the sight of Mr. Ramsay's boat sailing at last to the lighthouse: "the sea and sky looked all one fabric." And she completes her spatializing "vision" of the Ramsays when "with a sud- den intensity, as if she saw it clear for a second, she drew a line there, in the centre" of her canvas. Mrs. Ramsay earlier understood that her stilled vision of the dinner party was organized around a spatial center-"the still space that lies about the heart of things."16 Wordsworth moves toward stasis in his relatively long narrative poem "The Thorn," which raises a problem of interpretation that illustrates the difference between traditional and epiphanic narrative. If we read the poem the way people used to, as an objective story told by a reliable narrator, it becomes a melodramatic, social-protest story about a wronged woman, jilted at the altar, who is driven to murder her illegitimate infant. If, however, we take seriously Wordsworth's note to the poem-as Stephen Parrish says we shouldl7-we read an unreliable narrative by a sea captain, newly arrived in the district, who hears the story of Martha Ray through village gossip and associates it 346</page><page sequence="13">THE EPIPHANIC MODE IN WORDSWORTH AND MODERN LITERATURE 347 with an earlier epiphanic experience of a thorn tree. The poem, which carries later information back into an earlier experience, sub- stitutes for temporal sequence a psychological organization around a center, thus showing in an experience of nature the psychological genesis of the village legend that Martha sits beside the thorn wailing for her dead infant. This reading throws doubt on the story of Martha-on whether she murdered, or even gave birth to, a baby, and whether she really does sit beside the thorn. The interest shifts to the narrator and, as Wordsworth says in his note, to "the general laws [of association] by which superstition acts upon the mind." The only thing certain is the narrator's experience of the thorn; so that the poem evolves through epiphanic intensification of the thorn, as it evolved in Wordsworth's own experience of the thorn. The poem, says Wordsworth, "arose out of my observing, on the ridge of Quantock Hill, on a stormy day, a thorn which I had often passed in calm and bright weather without noticing it. I said to myself, 'Cannot I by some invention do as much to make this Thorn perma- nently an impressive object as the storm has made it to my eyes at this moment?"' Here are the stanzas about the narrator's epiphanic experience of the thorn in a storm on a mountaintop, which took place "Ere I had heard of Martha's name." "'Twas mist and rain, and storm and rain: No screen, no fence could I discover; And then the wind! in sooth, it was A wind full ten times over. I looked around, I thought I saw A jutting crag,-and off I ran, Head-foremost, through the driving rain, The shelter of the crag to gain; And, as I am a man, Instead of jutting crag, I found A Woman seated on the ground." (Ll. 177-87) What he probably finds is the thorn; what he probably hears is the sound of the wind: "I did not speak-I saw her face; Her face!-it was enough for me; I turned about and heard her cry, 'Oh misery! oh misery!"' (LI. 188-91)</page><page sequence="14">NEW LITERARY HISTORY All has been hearsay; no one in the village has actually seen Martha on the mountaintop. This is the one time the narrator claims to have seen a woman there; yet it is the time when visibility is poorest. The poor visibility could have produced an anthropomorphic illusion to which he later attached the name Martha. Blake's dictum that every intense experience of nature is anthropomorphic accounts for the origin of legends and myths. If the narrator really does see Martha, then the poem is not, as Wordsworth said it was, a study of superstition. However we interpret these lines-and it is enough that we read them as ambiguous to make the poem a lyrical rather than an objective narrative-the shift in the next lines to present and future tenses indicates that the narrator could not possibly see such a timeless scene: "And there she sits, until the moon Through half the clear blue sky will go; And, when the little breezes make The waters of the pond to shake, As all the country know, She shudders, and you hear her cry, 'Oh misery! oh misery!"' (Ll. 192-98) "As all the country know" shows that the narrator is carrying later information about Martha back into his account of the earlier expe- rience and assimilating that experience to the legend-a nature legend deriving Martha's "shudders" from shaking waters. Like other Wordsworth narratives, like "Michael" which begins with a heap of stones, this poem begins with a thorn which is so intensely seen as to seem ready to give birth to Martha's woeful story. "There is a Thorn-it looks so old, In truth, you'd find it hard to say How it could ever have been young, It looks so old and grey. Not higher than a two years' child It stands erect, this aged Thorn; No leaves it has, no prickly points; It is a mass of knotted joints, A wretched thing forlorn. It stands erect, and like a stone With lichens is it overgrown. "Like rock or stone, it is o'ergrown, With lichens to the very top, 348</page><page sequence="15">THE EPIPHANIC MODE IN WORDSWORTH AND MODERN LITERATURE 349 And hung with heavy tufts of moss, A melancholy crop: Up from the earth these mosses creep, And this poor Thorn they clasp it round So close, you'd say that they are bent With plain and manifest intent To drag it to the ground; And all have joined in one endeavor To bury this poor Thorn for ever." (LI. 1-22) These stanzas are not epiphanic because there is no moment of ob- servation, no sudden shift in perception. They seem to crystallize the results of epiphany-Wordsworth's and the narrator's-and to ex- plain why in his epiphanic experience the narrator turns the thorn into a woman. The opening and epiphanic stanzas make "The Thorn" a lyrical nature poem in which the story is half objective and half a way of dramatizing Wordsworth's and the narrator's feelings about the thorn. The assimilation of Martha's story to natural forces works, as in other Wordsworth narratives, to give the story its lyrical quality and save it from sentimentality and melodrama the way music saves an opera from its melodramatic libretto. Wordsworth's most characteristic nature passages are organized as epiphanies. In the midst of his eighteenth-century style early poem Descriptive Sketches (1793), with its generalized descriptions of nature ("And what if ospreys, cormorants, herons cry, / Amid tempestuous vapours driving by"), one passage points toward the Romantic Wordsworth. In the contrast between this passage and the rest, we see the difference between description, which relies on rhetoric, and epiphany, which relies on dramatic organization. This Romantic passage is organized around a sudden change as, after rain, the sun appears over the Swiss lake, imbuing the whole landscape with its light: But what a sudden burst of overpowering light! Triumphant on the bosom of the storm, Glances the wheeling eagle's glorious form! Eastward, in long perspective ... The perspective locates an observer, who adds a tactile perception of the sun's heat to the visual perception of its light: Eastward, in long perspective glittering, shine The wood-crowned cliffs that o'er the lake recline;</page><page sequence="16">NEW LITERARY HISTORY Those lofty cliffs a hundred streams unfold, At once to pillars turned that flame with gold. A new agent of perception is introduced: Behind his sail the peasant shrinks, to shun The west, that burns like one dilated sun, A crucible of mighty compass, felt By mountains, glowing till they seem to melt. (LI. 254-55, 274-84)18 The peasant completes the internalization of the scene; for we, by way of the observer, project ourselves into the peasant's feeling of heat to sense the mountains' internal glowing. The sudden climactic en- largement of the scene's unity as "one dilated sun," burning externally and internally and uniting human beings with the landscape, is pre- cisely epiphanic. "A Night Piece," written in 1798 when Wordsworth's style was se- curely Romantic, is organized in the same way. The moon, which has been hidden by clouds, suddenly appears; and "the pensive traveller," whose "unobserving eye" has been "bent earthwards," suddenly looks up-the clouds are split Asunder,-and above his head he sees The clear Moon, and the glory of the heavens. He experiences an epiphany of the distant, silent motion of the stars. The auditory sense is added to the visual, in that the silence of the stars is distinctly contrasted to their motion and to the sound of the wind: "the wind is in the tree, / But they are silent;-still they roll along / Immeasurably distant." This is a typically Wordsworthian epiphany of cosmic process, characterized by Wordsworth's favorite verb roll, a word that adds the tactile to the visual and auditory senses-the auditory sense is usually invoked through its unexpected absence. "At length the Vision closes," we are told. The epiphany lasts a moment, and is usually defined at both ends. De Quincey records Wordsworth's statement about the shift in perception that produces epiphanies. Wordsworth said that from his earliest days he had observed that if "the attention is energetically braced up to an act of steady observation, or of steady expectation, then, if this intense condition of vigilance should suddenly relax, at that moment any beautiful, any impressive visual object, or collection of objects, falling upon the eye, is carried to the heart with a power not known under other circumstances." Wordsworth cites as illustra- 350</page><page sequence="17">THE EPIPHANIC MODE IN WORDSWORTH AND MODERN LITERATURE 351 tion the beautiful passage in The Prelude, Book V, on the Boy of Winander, Wordsworth himself. This boy liked at evening on the lake to imitate the hootings of owls "that they might answer him," and they did. But sometimes they did not, and the unexpected silence would come as "a gentle shock of mild surprise" that carried far into his heart the voice Of mountain torrents; or the visible scene Would enter unawares into his mind, With all its solemn imagery, its rocks, Its woods, and that uncertain heaven, received Into the bosom of the steady lake. (L1. 374, 382-88) The scene figures as "imagery" because it is both external and inter- nal. De Quincey notes spatialization of the experience in the word "far," and goes on to describe his own epiphanic response: "This very expression, 'far,' by which space and its infinities are attributed to the human heart, and to its capacities of re-echoing the sublimities of nature, has always struck me as with a flash of sublime revelation."19 The heaven, in Wordsworth's last two verse lines, is "uncertain" be- cause reflected in the fluid lake-a sign of how precisely sensuous are the perceptions that produce epiphanies. Epiphanies produce an effect that might be called "the modern sublime." For while they produce in the reader the emotions named by writers on the sublime-Longinus's "transport," Burke's "terror" and "astonishment"-they add an awareness of disparity between the diction and visualization, on the one hand, and the sublime effect on the other. The sense of disparity is particularly acute in Joyce. Wordsworth often employs Miltonic diction and many of the visual devices named by Burke-obscurity, heights, boundariless expanses suggesting infinity. Joyce, however, usually produces the sublime ef- fect out of small, sharp details delivered in a flat diction-though such details combine in "The Dead" to produce an epiphany that is excep- tional in Joyce for the Wordsworthian and Burkean quality of its sublimity.20 The sensuous shifts that produce the transformations of Wordsworth's epiphanies are described in Wordsworth's "I saw them [natural objects] feel" (Prelude, Bk. III, 1. 132), and are concisely illus- trated in the three best known "spots of time" in The Prelude. In the episode of the stolen rowboat in Book I, it is the sudden appearance of a mountain, hitherto unseen as the boy rows away from the shore, which creates the optical illusion that the mountain is striding after him like a punishing deity. The ice-skating episode in Book I is the</page><page sequence="18">NEW LITERARY HISTORY best example of synesthesia, the employment of all the senses to pro- duce an epiphany. The steel of the ice skates and "the polished ice" are tactile equivalents of the cold night. The metallic sounds are au- ditory equivalents of the cold: "the precipices rang aloud; / The leaf- less trees and every icy crag / Tinkled like iron" (Bk. I, 11. 440-42). The visual equivalent of the cold night as a gleam in darkness becomes ap- parent when we are told that sometimes the boy would leave "the tumultu- ous throng" to skate "across the reflex of a star" (11. 449-50). The shift from group to private experience prepares the epiphany of cosmic process, when suddenly the boy would stop short, producing the op- tical and tactical illusion that still the solitary cliffs Wheeled by me-even as if the earth had rolled With visible motion her diurnal round! (L1. 458-60) The richness of sensuous texture makes it possible for us to partici- pate in the epiphany, because we feel the interplay on our own senses. The climactic epiphany on Mt. Snowdon in Book XIV begins with optical illusion. The sudden appearance of the moon makes the mist around seem a "still ocean" (1. 44), with the surrounding hills static billows. This illusory ocean stretches out to the real Atlantic in the distance. The optical illusion is reinforced by an auditory illusion, by the roar of inland waters that sounds like ocean roaring. This sensu- ous transformation produces the epiphany of the moon shining on waters: "the emblem of a mind" brooding "over the dark abyss"- waiting, like Milton's God in the opening passage of Paradise Lost, to bring forth the world. This epiphany of the creative imagination is accomplished through the blending of sight and sound, out of which the whole episode has been woven: the emblem of a mind That feeds upon infinity, that broods Over the dark abyss, intent to hear Its voices issuing forth to silent light In one continuous stream. (Bk. XIV, 11. 70-74) Note how in the last two lines sound and sight blend with touch as the "voices issuing forth to silent light" become a wet "stream." In tracing the art of epiphany to our own time, I must point out that Wordsworth invented the epiphanic or modern sonnet. Wordsworth 352</page><page sequence="19">THE EPIPHANIC MODE IN WORDSWORTH AND MODERN LITERATURE 353 wrote two kinds of sonnet-the Miltonic or discursive and the epiphanic sonnet. The best example of Wordsworth's Miltonic sonnet is "London, 1802": "Milton! thou should'st be living at this hour"- which, like Milton's sonnets, says something, makes a point. The best example of Wordsworth's epiphanic sonnet is "Composed Upon Westminster Bridge," which does not say anything. This sonnet does more than describe London at sunrise; it evokes the city's life. It produces an epiphany of human as distinguished from natural life, through the implied contrast between human activity and natural stillness. The whole sonnet operates like a spring wound up in the direction of silence and stillness, so that it can be released into the opposite direction of activity and noise. The octave gives a visual and auditory description of the sun rising over the empty, silent city, the beauty of which is continuous at this hour with the beauty of the country. The coming discontinuity is broached, however, in the eighth line: "All bright and glittering in the smokeless air," which suggests the smoke to come. Internalization begins in the sestet, which introduces the tactile sense: "Never did sun more beautifully steep / In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill." A sensibility not only sees the sun but also feels its warmth from within the landscape. This is the sensibility, as the next line indicates, upon which the epiphany will register: "Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!" The internalization-as evidenced by the combination of vi- sual, auditory, and tactile senses-comes to a climax in: "The river glideth at his own sweet will." "Sweet will" gives us-through the line's delicate anthropomorphization-the internalized, tactile sense of a peace so perfect that the only motion and will are the river's. Yet the river's silent gliding prepares for the epiphany of power, for the mighty life that will spring into action when the city awakens: "Dear God! the very houses seem asleep; / And all that mighty heart is lying still!" In "It Is a Beauteous Evening, Calm and Free," the epiphany occurs in the middle, when the sea's silence and calm make audible its sur- prising, distant roar: Listen! the mighty Being is awake, And doth with his eternal motion make A sound like thunder-everlastingly. The rest of the sonnet reflects on this epiphany of deity. Such sonnets gave rise to Keats's sonnets, which are almost all epiphanic-illustrating Keats's phrase in a letter about "coming con- tinually on the spirit with a fine suddenness."21 "On First Looking</page><page sequence="20">NEW LITERARY HISTORY Into Chapman's Homer," a sonnet about sudden discoveries, reveals in its last lines the structure of epiphany; for "Cortez" stares outward upon the Pacific, while his men look inward-looking "at each other with a wild surmise." Involved in all epiphanies is both discovery and the shock of recognition-recognition of the self in the external world. Keats's "bright star," in the sonnet of that name, might be considered the eye transformed by epiphany, beholding natural process as a stilled moment. Rossetti-whose sonnet "Silent Noon" is a fine example of synesthetic stilled epiphany ("Deep in the sun- searched growths the dragon-fly / Hangs like a blue thread")- defined the modern sonnet stemming from Wordsworth when he wrote in the introductory sonnet to House of Life: "A Sonnet is a moment's monument." Hopkins's sonnet "The Windhover" raises an interesting problem of interpretation. If we make the subtitle "To Christ our Lord" apply from the beginning and read the bird throughout as an emblem of Christ, we have the extended conceit of a metaphysical poem. But if, as seems more likely, we read the bird as really observed, we have a Romantic nature poem; and it is only in the moment of epiphany, when the falcon gains power through buckling or diving, that he is transformed for the poet-priest into an emblem of Christ, who gained power through a downward movement into martyrdom: "Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion / Times told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!" The analogy is emotional not logical, since the observer stops short of considering the purpose of the bird's dive; that is why we have epiphany, not conceit. Epiphany and conceit exclude each other. Yeats's sonnet "Leda and the Swan" is literally about the manifesta- tion of a god as a bird and the impregnation of flesh by spirit through Zeus's rape of Leda. The whole sonnet is an epiphany, culminating in the moment of orgasm when Leda may or may not know, but the poet knows, that she is being impregnated with a historical cycle: A shudder in the loins engenders there The broken wall, the burning roof and tower And Agamemnon dead. "Leda and the Swan" raises a problem, however, for my definition of epiphany, in that there is no observer on the scene, so that we must read the poem as visionary. Yet the vision is so sensuously conceived as to make an effect unlike that of traditional visions and like that of modern realistic epiphanies (which are themselves sensuously vivid fictions); I am tempted therefore to suggest a category of visionary 354</page><page sequence="21">THE EPIPHANIC MODE IN WORDSWORTH AND MODERN LITERATURE 355 epiphanies. Such a category could account for the modern effect of an internally glowing vision like Blake's "The Tyger," which projects the vitality of a real tiger, stilled, as in a picture: "Tyger! Tyger! burning bright." Let me conclude this tracing of epiphany from Wordsworth to the present by pointing out the evolution in Eliot's poetry from Romantic to Christian epiphany. Eliot's early poems inhabit the scientific, Romantic world of nonbelief checkered by inexplicable moments of spiritual insight. The best example is the scene in The Waste Land where a real girl carrying hyacinths becomes the occasion for a vision so profound that the protagonist spends the rest of the poem trying to recover that vision, thus making an analogue to the legendary Quest for the Grail: -Yet when we came back, late, from the hyacinth garden, Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither Living nor dead, and I knew nothing, Looking into the heart of light, the silence.22 (Ll. 37-41) Even so early, Eliot goes beyond Wordsworth in trying to stabilize the effect of epiphany; Wordsworth is content to remember, Eliot wants to recover, the vision. Eliot deals with the Christian Epiphany in "Journey of the Magi," written in 1927, the year he converted to the Anglican Church. The Magi behold the manifestation of God as an infant, know that some- thing irrevocable has happened, but do not understand it and cannot change their lives to accord with it. Not until Four Quartets (1943) is Eliot able to stabilize epiphanies through theological interpretation of them. In the first poem, "Burnt Norton," he deals with Romantic epiphany: But only in time can the moment in the rose-garden, The moment in the arbour where the rain beat, The moment in the draughty church at smokefall Be remembered. (Pt. II) "Only through time," through such privileged moments, "time is con- quered." He associates such moments in and out of time with the Incarnation, the Word, "the still point of the turning world," which</page><page sequence="22">NEW LITERARY HISTORY gives pattern to life, stillness to movement. Nevertheless, "Burnt Norton" ends with another epiphany that only reminds the poet of the "Ridiculous . . . waste sad time / Stretching before and after" the privileged moment. In the second poem, "East Coker," Eliot demands more than the privileged moment: Not the intense moment Isolated, with no before and after, But a lifetime burning in every moment And not the lifetime of one man only But of old stones that cannot be deciphered. (Pt. V) Religion and the sense of tradition are ways of stabilizing epiphany, of objectifying intensity. This possibility is explained in the third poem, "The Dry Salvages": But to apprehend The point of intersection of the timeless With time, is an occupation for the saint- For most of us, there is only the unattended Moment, the moment in and out of time, The distraction fit, lost in a shaft of sunlight. Such privileged moments "are only hints and guesses." But The hint half guessed, the gift half understood, is Incarnation. Here the impossible union Of spheres of existence [flesh and spirit] is actual. (Pt. V) Epiphany, the Romantic substitute for religion, becomes the means of returning to and revalidating dogma as experience. In the last poem, "Little Gidding," the sensuous transformations of Romantic epiphany become mystical. The spring holiday Pentecost- another Christian Epiphany, celebrating the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples-is experienced as "midwinter spring" be- cause frost and fire are magnified by the sun-reflecting ice: Midwinter spring is its own season 356</page><page sequence="23">THE EPIPHANIC MODE IN WORDSWORTH AND MODERN LITERATURE 357 When the short day is brightest, with frost and fire, The brief sun flames the ice.... (Pt. I) This is "pentecostal fire / In [winter] the dark time of the year"-and the dark time of England's history, World War II. "This is the spring time / But not in time's covenant." Where, asks the poet, is redemp- tion: "Where is the summer, the unimaginable / Zero summer?"- "zero" because not in time's covenant. The answer lies in the collaps- ing of the whole year and the whole of England's history within that stilled moment of pentecostal illumination. The passage takes its structure from Romantic epiphany. Eliot is a great poet because he embraces the whole of the poetic tradition up to his time and takes it a step forward. Wordsworth is the great seminal Romantic poet who revolutionized the tradition of his time, giving rise to much that is most innovative in Romantic and modern literature.
