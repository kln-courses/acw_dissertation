Dreams as Memory and Metaphor  in Sólo Dios sabe (Only God Knows), 2005 Director: Carlos Bolado Screenwriters: Carlos Bolado and Diane Weipert Cinematographer: Federico Barbabosa By Cathleen Rountree   There’s something about Latin american cinema that gets un- der one’s skin: the blend of old World and new World sensibilities,  the brewing mysticism of indigenous and catholic rituals, the visceral  approach to life, the earthy women, the personification of nature, and  the elements of magic realism found in films by contemporary direc- tors. The last few years have brought a renaissance of Latin american  cinema in argentina, brazil, and Mexico (and to a lesser degree in  chile and Peru as well). These filmmakers include: argentinians eliseo  Subiela (Man Facing Southeast, 1986, El Lado oscuro del corazón/ The Dark Side of the Heart, 1992, Lifting de corazón/Heartlift, 2005),  Fabián bielinsky (Nine Queens, 2002, and El Aura/The Aura, 2005), and  Lucrecia Martel (La Niña santa/The Holy Girl, 2004, and La Ciéniga/ The Swamp, 2001); brazilians Fernando Meirelles (Cidade de Deus/ City of God, 2002, and The Constant Gardener, 2005) and Walter Salles  (Central do Brasil/Central Station, 1998, and Diarios de motocicleta/ The Motorcycle Diaries, 2004); and Mexicans arturo ripstein (El  Evangelio de las Maravillas/Divine, 1998, and La Perdición de los  hombres/The Ruination of Men, 2000), alfonso cuarón (Y tú mamá  también, 2001, and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,  2003), alejandro gonzález iñárritu (Amorés perros, 2000, and 21  Grams, 2003). Mexican director carlos bolado was born in Veracruz in 1964. his  second narrative feature film, Sólo Dios sabe received accolades in 2006  at three major film festivals north of the border: Sundance in January,  Miami in March, and the San Francisco international in april. Sólo is a  follow-up to bolado’s first narrative feature Bajo California: El límite  </page> <page sequence="2">  </page> <page sequence="3"> del tiempo/Under California: The Limit of Time (1998), which won  seven ariels, Mexico’s highest cinematic award, including best Picture  of 1999, and played at the San Francisco international Film Festival that  same year. bolado also makes documentaries and is best known for  Promises (co-directed with b.Z. goldberg and Justine Shapiro), 2001,  an alternative look at the Jewish-Palestinian conflict featuring several  Jewish and Palestinian children. The filmmakers arranged for the two  groups to have contact with each other, and then filmed the interac- tions for three years. Promises was nominated for an academy award  in 2002. Prior to directing his own films, bolado (who also served as  screenwriter, editor, and producer on Sólo) worked for many years as  an editor (Amorés perros and Like Water for Chocolate, 1992). Sólo  Dios sabe solidifies bolado’s position as an emerging master director.  Sólo Dios sabe begins as a conventional love story about a beau- tiful young brazilian woman attending art school in San Diego, en- meshed in a dead-end affair with a married professor. on an evening  outing at a dance club across the border in Tijuana, Dolores seren- dipitously meets Damián calderón, a young Mexican journalist who  is finishing up a story and preparing to drive back home to Mexico  city. Dolores Silveira, who’s lost her passport, hitches a ride south with  Damián and the fun and soul-searching begin. Part kismet romance,  road trip, and, ultimately, spiritual voyage of self-discovery, Sólo Dios  sabe, in english, Spanish, and Portuguese, is lushly photographed with  a matching sensual soundtrack by brazilian electronic musician otto  and Mexican alternative rock singer Julieta Venegas.  Dolores is played by the exhilarating alice braga (the niece of  Sonja), who also starred in City of God.

Jung1 Act I  as the opening credits roll, we hear the sound of running wa- ter, but the images are blurred and difficult to decipher. Slowly, a pair  of expressive hands comes into focus as they shape birds out of leaves  and float them on a river current. The first clear image is of an attrac- tive woman standing on flat river stones playfully dancing with a young  girl who could be her daughter or granddaughter. because the scene is  filmed in soft-focus, it conveys the sense of a memory or a dream.  Suddenly a single brown eye fills the screen, but there is some- thing odd about it — it is upside down. as the image slowly turns right  side up, and zooms out, we realize that the opening sequence signi- fied a daydream of a beautiful woman with the brown eye while she  was having sex with, we soon learn, her married professor in his col- lege office. (From the very beginning, water and sex are linked.) he  later breaks an evening tryst with Dolores, an art student, and, in dis- appointment, she agrees to venture with her friends to a dance club  across the border in Tijuana.  once inside the nightclub, the brazilian beauty dances with un- inhibited sensuality and catches the eye and imagination of Damián.  however, when Dolores shows no interest in him, he disappointedly  saunters outside to his car just in time to see Dolores’s friends’ car be- ing broken into.

Thus, begins his quan- dary: to return the passport or take the opportunity to woo her. he  cannot resist the prospect of spending three days with this intriguing  woman and pockets the passport. before they leave, however, they buy  “worship cards” from a woman street-vendor. he picks our Lady of  Thunder, the saint of abandoned souls; she selects The Lonely Soul, an  image of a woman, in chains, encircled in flames.  once inside Damián’s copper Valiant convertible (the knight  who saves the damsel in distress), Dolores immediately notices the  dashboard altar, on which he has just placed the image of our Lady  of Thunder. Dolores rolls her eyes and laughs at his superstition.  before long, he pulls over at a turn in the road overlooking a cliff and  sprinkles holy water over a roadside memorial commemorating the  lives of those who died on that stretch of highway. Dolores surveys  dozens of crashed cars crouched among the boulders like abandoned,  lonely souls.  back on the road, Dolores mentions her grandmother, a “famous  photographer,” who “taught [her] almost everything [she] knows.” it is  clear that she is much closer to her mother’s mother than she is to her  own mother. Damián accidentally hits and kills a zopilote, a vulture; he  takes the death seriously, and buries it beneath the tallest cactus he can  find, lights a candle and prays for god to take “the soul of this scaven- ger.” When Dolores scoffs at his sentimentality, he replies: “The zopi- lote is a noble creature because it is one of the few animals that doesn’t  kill to live.” They stop   That night, when they pull into a motel, Damián surreptitiously  arranges for them to share the same room, and the same bed, but ...  and she hears  nothing happens. a hidden river,  The next day, when Dolores is driving, she finds a fortune cookie  and guides   promise on the driver’s visor: “happiness is right around the corner.”  him to it. They stop at a small village below the volcano, Paricutín, that erupted  the year Damián’s father was born. They stop and she hears a hidden  river, and guides him to it. They talk about the earthworks of the late  cuban-born artist, ana Mendieta, and as a sort of homage, Damián  traces the outline of Dolores’s body in the sand along the riverbank.  The silhouette echoes Dolores’s recurring dreams of herself floating  on a river.

Finally, the inevitable happens. after participating in the local fes- tival revelry (including downing a few shots of pulqué) and lying be- neath the moon and stars on the hood of the Valiant, the two souls — one “abandoned,” the other “lost” — begin making love, just as a cloud  bursts and drenches them. (once again, water and sex are linked. here  is a spiritual baptism. The union of man and woman will ultimately  lead to the transformation of both.) but, in the morning, in order to put  Dolores at ease, like a true gentleman, he says, “We can pretend noth- ing happened.” once the two arrive at Damián’s home in Mexico city, another  venerated woman (again, in memory only) enters the scene. he tells  Dolores that after his mother died he was raised by his, now de- ceased, grandmother, and this was the apartment in which they lived.  numerous altars around the house attest to his devotion to the trap- pings of catholic ritual. one altar honors a statue of “The Lonely Soul,”  while another is dedicated to the dead because, as he says, “sometimes  you can hear them in your thoughts.”  During the middle of the night they are awakened by inez,  Damián’s hysterical ex-girlfriend. She pleads for them to reunite. We  intuit that she was pregnant, but no longer. When he returns upstairs,  he breaks down and Dolores comforts him. again, they make love and,  again, Dolores dreams she is floating on the river. The next day, at the federal building, Dolores calls her moth- er in São Paulo and learns that (like the noble zopilote) her beloved  grandmother has been struck and killed by a car.

Dolores reads a letter from her grandmother, which directs her to  a sacred room with a cryptic message: “in the center of the altar is the  foundation of our ancestors.” Dolores had no idea about this side of her  grandmother, but is curious and feels both a sense of peace among the  stones, revered objects, and statues she finds in the sanctuary. She no- tices a portrait on the wall of a beautiful black woman dressed in white  and wearing the same wide bracelets given to Dolores by her grand- mother, but does not recognize her. From this point forward the film takes on a new dimension. Fascinated by what she has found, Dolores visits a santaría bo- tanica. The proprietress advises her to return the stones to a river near  Salvador in bahia. (“oxalá help you if you don’t take them there,” she  threatens.) before Dolores leaves on her mission, however, she con- fronts her mother beside the swimming pool. “Did you know grandma  was religious?” she asks, before diving into the pool. “That she was in- volved with Candomblé?” her mother denies that the grandmother was  “religious.” “She was superstitious because of her nana, Duda, and her  mother.

During the rousing drumming  and dancing, she is overcome with emotion and faints.  Act III upon returning to her mother’s home in São Paulo, she finds her  in a semi-seductive conversation with Damián. Dolores insists that  he leave. but when she moves into her grandmother’s apartment, he  comes to visit once more before returning to Mexico. Dolores discov- ers that she’s pregnant and knows that, because her lover Jonathan had  a vasectomy, only Damián can be the father. She doesn’t tell him, but  instead, in a twist on his earlier action, she takes his passport. he tries to convince her that they are meant for each other. (at  this point bolado touches on Jung’s concept of synchronicity.) “i be- lieve fate is what god knows is best for us, whether we realize it or  not. Things sometimes seem like coincidences, but they’re not. i know  you don’t believe in god,” Damián tells her (without knowing any- thing about her recent “conversion” experience), “so call it whatever  you want. but every moment, every instant was put there so you and i  would meet.” and then, the truth: “you can change fate, but that means  going against your own happiness.” however, when Dolores reveals to him her pregnancy, he loses it.  in the next scene she is sitting with her mother in the reception area of “... call it what- an abortion clinic. clearly distressed, when her mother goes to fetch ever you want.  her checkbook from the car, Dolores bolts and soul-searches her way  back to the apartment. in the meantime, Damián has decided that he’s But every   ready to bring a new life into the world.

Reflections The water that the mother, the unconscious,  pours into the basin of the anima is an excellent  symbol for the living power of the psyche. — carl g. Jung 2     a profound spirituality pervades Sólo Dios sabe. This pres- ence can be attributed to the primary motifs of time, memory, water,  and the nature of dreams that course through the film. “Time isn’t a  thing,” Dostoyevsky once said, it’s an idea.” in turn, the russian director  andrey Tarkovsky writes: “Memory is a spiritual concept ... Time and  memory merge into each other; they are like the two sides of a medal.” 3  in Jungian terms, water conveys a variety of symbolic experiences and  icons: birth, baptism, the unconscious, the moon, initiation, transfor- mation, fertility, the mother, chaos, life, the primeval, death. as such, it  becomes an alchemical element of transformation. Meandering   as the primary source of water, oceans are governed by the moon,  slowly to the   so, like the moon, water has associations with mystery and the fem- sea, the river   inine creative principle. (Synchronistically, Diego Luna’s last name  can also   denotes “moon” in Spanish.) The sea represents the unconscious and  symbolize a  infinity, the cosmic ocean from which all life has emerged and into  journey into...   which it must eventually dissolve. a river is both a symbol of fertil-ity and an image of the never-ending flow of time. Meandering slowly  the under- to the sea, the river can also symbolize a journey into death (of which  world [which]  Dolores’s dreams are prescient), as journeys to the underworld often  often involve[s]   involve the crossing of a river.  the crossing  as if commenting directly on the film, Jung writes that the goal of  of a river.  the human being is “the ultimate integration of conscious and uncon- scious.”4 he continues with: “Such reflections are unavoidable if one  wants to understand the meaning of ‘big dreams.’ They employ numer- ous mythological motifs that characterize the life of the hero[ine], of  that greater [wo]man who is semi-divine by nature. here we find the             Cathleen Rountree, Dreams as Memory and Metaphor in Solo Dios sabe  44 </page> <page sequence="10"> dangerous adventures and ordeals such as occur in initiations ... the  transformative processes and substances of alchemy.” 5 The “big dream” in Dolores’s life, of course, is one that intermin- gles the past with the future in a simultaneity of time: The supernatural  echoes in her dreams, revealing familial truths of which the body, but  not the mind, is cognizant.  it is worth noting that the name Dolores, from the old French  doloros and from Late Latin dolorosus, of course, signifies pain, hard- ship, grief, and suffering. as a Spanish name, it refers to the Marian ti- tle, Maria de los Dolores, “Mary of Sorrows,” a reference to the seven  sorrows of the virgin in christian belief. our character Dolores expe- riences more than her share of sorrow, but eventually she transcends  the temporal and material to continue the matrilineal spiritual heritage  that began with her great-grandmother, Mãe Maria.  The Candomblé Religion in an interview with Director carlos bolado, i received the fol- lowing background information on Candomblé.6 Candomblé’s origin  (dating from the 16th century) is similar to the better-known Santería  religion found in the carribean, cuba, and the united States. it is pri- marily found in bahia, brazil, but practiced in various forms through- out South america and West africa. Candomblé fuses West african  (especially yoruban and ewe) tribal beliefs and mythology with the  practices (and knowledge of medicinal herbs), dances, and magic of  indigenous brazilian indian shamans, and embraces ancient spirits/ gods from both cultures. a third component includes the syncretism  of indian beliefs shrouding their religion in catholic imagery (especial- Candomblé ...   ly incorporating the saints) to pacify their Portuguese masters. includes the   Practitioners of Candomblé believe in one all-powerful god, syncretism   olodumare, who is served by deities who visit earth and communi- of Indian beliefs  cate with earthlings through exu, a messenger god. These are similar shrouding their   to the christian god (olodumare’s role corresponds to Jesus’) and the religion in  catholic saints of the Portuguese colonizers. The brazilian slaves rec- ognized these parallels and identified their deities with the catholic Catholic imagery  saints. This practice allowed followers of Candomblé to worship their (especially   deities in secret behind the guise of the white man’s saints. incorporating   a devotee of Candomblé may belong to many deities, or orixás, the saints) to  or merely one, which controls her destiny and acts as her protector. a pacify their  devotee’s actions are influenced by her orixá. Like the signs of the zo- Portuguese   diac, followers of each orixá will exhibit specific characteristics such masters. as the miraculous fertility Dolores experiences through oxum (the  archetypal energy or “saint” associated with procreation, beauty, love,             C at h l e e n  R o u nt r e e ,  D r e a m s  a s  M e m o r y  a n d  M e t ap h o r  i n  S o l o  D i o s  s ab e   4 5 </page> <page sequence="11"> fertility, fresh water, and the arts) and can even become possessed by  the spirit of their orixá. Candomblé literally means a dance in honor of  the gods and it serves as a call to the spirits. as the spirit enters the body,  it falls into a state of trance. implied in the film is the fact that women  practitioners predominate the religion. The anthropomorphic nature of  the orixá allows an intimate contact between believer and deity, and the  highlight of the Candomblé ceremony is the epiphany, or possession,  when the orixá takes over the believer’s body as it does Dolores’s. Bolado’s Use of Metaphor Metaphors are poetic shorthand between an abstract concept  and an image. They engage us by instantly conveying a story idea in a  single illustration. carlos bolado and Diane Weipert’s screenplay seam- lessly applies this cinematic tool by extending the image of Dolores’s  water dream (and other references to water: the broken water pipe,  the swimming pool, the rivers) throughout the script. and with each  subsequent manifestation of her dreams — either innocently playing  by the river as a child, idyllically floating in the river as a healthy, happy  adult, sinking in panic, or, in the final scene, in which Dolores’s dream  has become a reality: succumbing to the void of death — more infor- mation is revealed and there is more at stake. bolado uses this meta- phor of water/river and all that it evokes in the viewer — birth, bap- tism, the unconscious, the moon, initiation, transformation, fertility,  the mother, chaos, life, the primeval, death — to signify what Jung calls,  “the living power of the psyche,” 7 as well as the alchemical element of  transformation in the protagonist’s journey. as such, it flows along, be- The highlight   side/within, Dolores, carrying the story, even as it generates it. in fact,  of the  the metaphor, in a sense, becomes the plot, constructing the action and dialogue that it triggers.

Do our ancestors live through  us? is love destined?), the film’s metaphysical exploration of dreams  and the mysteries of Mexican and brazilian religious rituals will engage  Jungian interests. bolado uses flowing water and the road trip as a met- aphor for spiritual transformation, and demonstrates a vivid sense of  an anthropomorphic natural world through haunting images.  Sólo Dios sabe screened at the San Francisco international Film  Festival on april 30 and May 1, 2006. Theatrical release is slated for  Fall 2006. endnotes  1. c. g.

The film  analysis “Dreams as Memory and Metaphor in Sólo Dios sabe (Only God Knows)”  examines this Mexican film from psychological, mythological, religious, and cinemat- ic perspectives. Director carlos bolado uses the road trip as a metaphor for spiritual  transformation. Dolores, a young brazilian woman meets Dámian from Mexico and  they pursue the possibility of true love. a family mystery unfolds when Dolores dis- covers that her maternal lineage is linked to Candomblé, a bahian version of syncretic  Santeria. her “big dreams” allow her psyche free passage between the realms of time Dolores’s   and space and elements, until memory itself becomes a spiritual concept.
