Jorg Salaquarda is remembered today for his remarkable work on the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, with his articles still being widely regarded as key texts in the field of Nietzsche studies. But Salaquarda's engagement with Nietzsche was also embedded in a wider philosophical interest in such questions as the relationship between philosophy and religion or the philosophical relevance of the body. These pursuits led him to a thorough reading and interpretation of Arthur Schopenhauers works, the outcome of which was a number of indispensable articles, which have now been published together for the first time in this volume. At the time of his premature death in 1999, Salaquarda was writing a study of Schopenhauers understanding of religion, and the articles printed in this volume</page><page sequence="2">MLR, 104.2, 2009 595 present some of the preliminary results of this research. Salaquarda's proposed monograph was intended to sum up his long-lasting interest in the philosophers atheism, a philosophical position that, for Salaquarda, had to be scrutinized and clarified. Although Schopenhauer did not elaborate a philosophy of religion, he had a predominant interest in this subject, since he understood the human being as an animal metaphysicum. Whereas philosophy fulfils metaphysical needs in a ratio nal way, religion satisfies these needs through allegorical means. When considered against the backdrop of his rejection of theism, anthropomorphism, and specula tions on the nature of the thing-in-itself, Schopenhauer's praise for mysticism seems to be surprising. But as Salaquarda shows, the nihil negativum which appears in the concluding section of Volume 1 of Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung is accom panied by an epi-philosophy' at the end of the second volume: here the negation of the world in its twofold expression of will and representation is so total that it is impossible to think of anything beyond it, for which philosophy and mysticism use the inadequate term nothingness'. This is the point at which Schopenhauer's soteriology and the Buddhist understanding of 'Nirvana' come close to each other. The way in which Nietzsche radicalizes Schopenhauer's theory of religion is demonstrated in Salaquarda's articles on Schopenhauer's impact on Nietzsche. The concept of a metaphysical need as the underlying origin of religions is turned upside down: according to Nietzsche, once the delusional character of religion was revealed, people took refuge in metaphysical explanations out of a customary habit. This is only one example where Salaquarda makes it clear?against the dominant interpre tations of his time?that Nietzsche's discussion of Schopenhauer did not end with a rejection of metaphysics in Menschliches, Allzumenschliches: rather, Schopenhauer was a constant presence in the background while Nietzsche's thinking took shape. This is most convincingly shown in the article on Nietzsche's Der Antichrist, where Salaquarda argues that Nietzsche's self-declaration as the Antichrist stems from Schopenhauer's understanding of this concept: that is, as describing a character who sees the world only in physical terms and denies its moral character. This article is a classic example of how thorough philological research can further our philosophical understanding of texts. This can equally be said about Salaquarda's comparison, outlined in the final essay in this volume, of the central role played by the body in both Schopenhauer's metaphysical philosophy and Nietzsche's anti-metaphysical revaluation of values'. In addition to the more recent articles on Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, the book contains two of Salaquarda's introductory texts, which makes it a valuable read even for those not so well acquainted with Schopenhauer scholarship. Matthias Kossler's introduction to Salaquarda's writings on Schopenhauer provides an important con textualization and reminds us of the great scholarly achievements of Jorg Salaquarda. The publication of this volume provides a welcome opportunity either to reread or to familiarize oneself with the work of this important thinker.
