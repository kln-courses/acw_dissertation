<plain_text><page sequence="1">James wiseman A Review Essay Boston University Boston, Massachusetts A number of scholarly and ethical problems involved in the study and publi- cation of ancient artifacts are discussed in this essay. The scholarly peril of basing historical or cultural interpretations on artifacts of uncertain or un- known provenience is illustrated by examples from recent scholarship, and the limitations of an artifact's capacity to communicate independently of its cultural context are assessed. The relationship between the antiquities market and scholarship is discussed in historical context, and the evolution over the past generation of related ethical and scholarly standards is considered. museums have artifacts from their own excavations that were brought to the museum with the consent of the country of origin; excavated material of this sort is not the subject of this paper. It is with collections containing artifacts of uncertain or unknown provenience, or more properly with the publication of such collections, that this essay is primarily concerned. I shall leave aside for the moment, to take them up later in the paper, the eth- ical considerations involved in the acquisition of such objects, and concentrate on scholarship. One question for consideration is whether or not a publication of objects without provenience merits the scholarly attention of archaeologists. Archaeologists, after all, like most art historians, must be concerned about the historical context of an artifact, for that is usually where its greatest significance lies. Many archaeologists, in- deed, would hold that without at least provenience an artifact has no archaeological value, and that study of such an artifact can contribute little or nothing to the study of humans and human society. The following re- cent comment by Paul N. Perrot of the Smithsonian Institution2 reflects a widely held archaeological view. . . . another important consideration is that the object that is stolen from its context often becomes a total loss to 2.

Introduction and Invitation The intent of this essay is to direct the attention of archaeologists and art historians toward certain problems involved in the publication of artifacts that are in mu- seums or private collections. The observations and com- mentary here are offered not so much as a polemic, though a point of view is maintained, as they are presented as a basis for debate in the hope that resolutions to some of the problems that are more satisfactory than those already advanced may result from an open discussion of the issues. Thoughtful responses from the readers of the Journal of Field Archaeology are invited. Catalogs and Complexities Most artifacts in private collections are of uncertain or unknown provenience. The same is often true of ob- jects in museum collections, though less frequently so as far as new acquisitions are concerned, at least among some of those museums that have publicly subscribed to the 1970 UNESCO "Convention on the Means of Pro- hibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Cultural Property.''l What is more, some 1. The full text of the Convention was published in JFA 3 (1976) 217-220. The Association of Art Museum Directors unanimously passed a resolution of support both for the Convention and for legis- lative action to implement the Convention on May 29, 1976. For the text of the resolution, see the letter of Ian M. White, then President of the Association, in Written Comments on H.R. 14171: Subcom- mittee on Trade of the Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives, 94th Congress, 2d Session (U.S. Government Printing Office: Washington 1976) 27. Scholarship and Provenience in the Study of Artifacts</page><page sequence="2">68 Scholarship and Provenience in the Study of ArtifactslWiseman knowledge. While we can still appreciate its beauty, we may totally lose its historical, sociological or even full technical significance. While such an object may titillate us today and give us pleasure, its testimony for the expansion of knowl- edge in the future may be forever lost. Allowing such des- poliation and illicit removal, therefore, results in denying to ourselves and to the future, the pleasure of knowing and, indeed, the right to know. There is another point of view. Many scholars, in- cluding some archaeologists, study artifacts primarily through stylistic and technological aspects, which often are used to determine the range of their chronological and cognitive interpretations. Knowledge of the archae- ological context of the artifacts would be beneficial, but is not essential, in their view, to the fruitful study of ancient art. James S. Ackerman, while cautioning us that "Nobody seriously recommends historical innocence ex- cept for polemic purposes,"3 has emphasized that the "art historian uses what he can discover of past situa- tions to supplement a direct experience of the artifact."4 What is more: Works of art of the past are distinguished from political- social acts or artifacts by their capacity to communicate independently of the conditions in and for which they were made, and by their ability to involve us emotionally and physically .5 Ackerman's lucid and penetrating essay thus makes explicit a number of concepts that are only implicit in many publications dealing with ancient artifacts, espe- cially those artifacts that, for whatever reason, have come to be classed as art objects. It is the artifact per se, in that case, that claims priority of concern and emphasis. The historical context (to say nothing of the archaeolog- ical context), in this view, is of less importance and, in any case, may be able to be reached through the nature of the object itself. The catalogs of museum exhibitions provide myriads of examples. It should be noted that Ackerman's contention that artifacts have "the capacity to communicate indepen- dently of the conditions in and for which they were made," is one with which most people, scholars or non- scholars, could agree (although the timelessness of art, however defined, is arguable).6 The disagreement would 3.

Fischer, ;;Art Styles as Cultural Cognitive Maps," AmAnth 63:1 (1961) 79-93. more likely lie, at least for the archaeologist, and aside from any appeal to aesthetic sensibilities, with the value of the communication from the artifact. Archaeologists and historians of art, we would suppose, would hold in higher value whatever the artifact might be able to "communicate" about the cultural contexts in which it played a part, than the aesthetic evaluation of the object in present-day social terms. There is nothing wrong with the latter; it is, however, quite a different kind of intel- lectual exercise. We shall return to this point later. If the artifact were genuine and from a known culture, presumably it could, with proper study and analysis, be made to yield some knowledge of its past, if only in a technological sense. The characterization of materials and various archaeometric analyses, for example, are not de- pendent on knowledge of provenience. And some arti- facts offer the prospect of more literal communication; e.g., a Maya codex or an inscribed stone plaque. Karl E. Meyer quotes Michael Coe, a distinguished scholar of the Maya, as follows. If someone brought me the Rosetta Stone, should I refuse to look at it because it was out of context and dug up by a pot hunter? Of course, I'd look at it, because if it was gen- uine it would add immeasurably to our knowledge.7 A similar argument has often been made for artifacts that are not as obviously revelatory by nature as the Ro- setta Stone; i.e., an object merits scholarly attention if there is reason to suppose that such attention would add anything at all to our knowledge. What is more, that argument runs, if the object is not studied, not made to contribute whatever it might to the knowledge of the past, that knowledge may be lost forever.8 Can (Should?) a responsible scholar be party to such a determined loss of knowledge, for whatever scruple? Here we begin to touch also on the ethical issues that have lent consider- able passion to the debate on how to deal (no double entendre is intended) with artifacts of unknown or un- certain provenience, specifically because they have been illegally removed from their archaeological context and country of origin, with the attendant destruction of that vital context. But before we turn to those issues, which do confront the scholar with a moral dilemma, there are other observations that may be made about the relation- ship between scholarship and artifacts. 7.

The reader will not be surprised, I suspect, by the fact that these guidelines are not widely followed in publications arising from the art trade. The book con- sidered in the following section provides an example of the more customary, incautious approach. Little Animals The recent, lavish publication of an exhibition of se- lected objects from a private collection includes a section that may mark the literary beginning of a new parallel to the saga of the "Ziwiye treasure." The book, edited by Arielle P. Kozloff, is Animals in Ancient Art from the Leo Mildenberg Collection, published by The Cleveland Museum of Art in cooperation with Indiana University Press (Bloomington, Indiana 1981); the latter is the dis- tributor ($29.95 in the United States). The exhibition, first conceived of by Sherman E. Lee, Director of The Cleveland Museum of Art, consisted of some 250 rep- resentations of animals in various art forms said to range in date over four millennia and to have come from the Near East, Egypt, and the Greco-Roman world. The mu- seums cited in the "Preface" (p. vii) as those to which the exhibition would travel were: The Cleveland Mu- seum of Art, Indiana University Art Museum, Toledo Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Museum, and the Uni- versity Art Museum of the University of California at Berkeley. The paper, the printing (by Verlag Philipp von Zabern in Mainz, West Germany), the photographic reproduc- tions, and, indeed, the overall production, financed by a "veIy generous grant from Barlk Leu, Zurich," (p. ix)l2 11. Muscarella, op cit. (in note 9) 216. Muscarella has often written on the scholarly dangers posed by publications of unexcavated objects; see, e.g., his iiSurkh Dum at The Metropolitan Museum of Art: a Mini-Report," JFA 8 (1981) 327-359; and his article in this issue of the JFA, with references to other publications on unexcavated objects cited in his notes 4 and 9. 12. Page references for citations of passages in Animals in Ancient Art are given in the text. The "Preface," pp. vii-ix; the introductory essay, "Animals from the Ancient Near East," pp. 5-8; and catalog entries la-o, along with the interpretive essay, were written by Arielle A Question of Provenience The disastrous effect on scholarship that can result from treating objects "said to be from" some place or other with the same kind of regard tendered to artifacts recovered in an archaeological excavation is nowhere more vividly depicted than in an article written some seven years ago by Oscar White Muscarella.9 In that article, Muscarella traces in meticulous detail the growth over 30 years of a body of objects said to be from Ziwiye in NW Iran. None of the objects was recovered in an archaeological excavation, and all were shown to have reached the public and the scholarly world through deal- ers in antiquities. The "treasure," said to have been recovered in romantic fashion at Ziwiye in 1947, grew to an astonishing size as catalogs of exhibitions in mu- seums and galleries, sales catalogs, and art historical studies continually added to the literature reports on ob- jects newly attributed to the "treasure." Other objects "said to be from Ziwiye" included forgeries that some scholars took to be ancient originals. Both the fakes and the genuine antiquities, not one of which could be proved to have come from Ziwiye, then formed the basis for theories regarding the origin of Scythian art (in NW Iran, of course). And artistic styles recognized among the ob- jects by various scholars ranged among Urartian, Ba- bylonian, Median, Cimmerian, Assyrian, Luristan, Phoenician, North Syrian, "perhaps Greek," and oth- ers. l0 This sad interweaving of scholarly endeavor with the purely profit-making activities of clandestine diggers, smugglers, and unscrupulous dealers in ancient art is not unique (Muscarella also cites as parallels material "said to be from" Luristan and other sites in Iran), nor is it restricted to one area of the world. The article makes starkly clear the scholarly peril of basing historical re- constructions of any kind on objects that do not have certain provenience. But they need not be ignored. Ac- cording to Muscarella, the genuine objects (i.e., not forged), 9. " 'Ziwiye' and Ziwiye: The Forgery of a Provenience," JFA 4 (1977) 196-219. 10. No scholar to my knowledge has challenged in print the accuracy of Muscarella's assessment of the objects "said to be from Ziwiye," with the exception of the late R. Ghirshman, a well-known scholar in Iranian studies, who contributed numerous articles on the "Ziwiye" material beginning in 1950, and who was responsible for many attri- butions. His final publication on the subject appears to be a response to Muscarella's article: Tombe princiere de Ziwiye et le debut de l'art animalier seythe (Publications de la Societe Iranienne pour la Con- servation du Patrimoine National: Paris 1979). Although Muscarella was nowhere mentioned by name in this slender volume, he was castigated as "un personnage'' by Ghirshman in the "Introduction." Muscarella's position was upheld by J.P.S. Moorey in his review of Ghirshman's book: JNES 41 (1982) 308-311.</page><page sequence="4">70 Scholarship and Provenience in the Study of ArtifactslWiseman are all first rate. Internationally respected conservators and experts in archaeometric analyses were consulted, as well as a number of other scholars. Under the circum- stances, the appearance of the publication could hardly be other than a notable scholarly event. The book, however, has not been introduced into this discussion in order to review it in full. We shall be con- cerned here chiefly with the constraints that the nature of the collection imposes on its study and with a critique of the historical and cultural significance attached by Kozloff to the first 15 objects in the catalog. It should be noted at the outset that the dramatic conclusions of Kozloff, especially the attribution of the objects to a previously unknown culture, represent a rashness that is not paralleled in the entries by other contributors else- where in the book. Those conclusions, however, and the discussion of those objects, do provide a compelling ex- ample of the dangers a scholar invites by placing too much faith in an artifact's "capacity to communicate" (see above, in the preceding section). We must look first at the background to the collection as it has been presented to the readers. I emphasize the latter for two reasons. 1) In any scholarly publication readers must make their assessment of conclusions reached by the author on the basis of the evidence that the author has presented. The reliability of the evidence, however, may be questioned by the reader (reviewer) with independent knowledge of the relevant material. In this case, 2) I have no independent knowledge of the specific objects discussed here, or of the Mildenberg collection as a whole. Let us now turn to the book itself. The book offers little inforrnation about how the total collection was assembled. The introductory material makes clear in that regard only that the collection grew over a number of years, presumably by purchase from, or trade with, dealers and other collectors. Readers also are not informed what were the criteria for the selection of objects for the exhibition. There is no reason to as- sume, therefore, that all objects of any given class in the collection are included in the exhibition. This latter issue has implications for the consideration of associated or "grouped" objects, as we shall see. The book does provide, however, some insight into P. Kozloff, Associate Curator in Charge of Ancient Art at the Cleve- land Museum of Art. The "Introduction," pp. 1-3, is unsigned. A1- though Leo Mildenberg was descnbed in warmly personal terms in this volume, his professional connections were cunously omitted and even his city of residence was not mentioned. There need be no mys- tery. At the end of the recent publication of a paper read at Harvard University, the author signed himself as being in the "Numismatic Department, Bank Leu Ltd., Zurich"; see Leo Mildenberg, "Bar Kokhba Coins and Documents,'' Harvard Studies in Classical Philolo- gy 84 (1980) 312-335. the aims and interests of the collector himself. That back- ground is relevant to assessing the value of the collection and the exhibition in terms of the potential contribution to our knowledge of the historical context in which the objects were originally set. I take that knowledge to in- clude the place and the role of the artifacts in the history of art; and, indeed, the Editor of the volume and the other contributors seem to have expected the exhibition to contribute such knowledge about the cultures the ar- tifacts represent, and not to serve only aesthetic plea- sures. These objects have allowed and inspired the presentation of new information that the authors hope will be of scientific, art historical, and iconographic interest and value. (p. 1) Dr. Leo Mildenberg, readers are told, chose the animals for his collection on the basis of quality and on the basis of his personal response to them rather than on (sic) a desire for encyclopedic representation. (p. 5) What criteria determined "quality" are not discussed. The number of complete, or nearly complete, pieces sug- gests that the state of preservation may have been as important a criterion as craftsmanship. The matter of "personal response," however, received some elabora- tion. The immediate appeal of the objects . . . is that they are almost entirely figures of living animals, not imaginary ones. A pacific man, a gentle man, Leo Mildenberg chose for his private pleasure ancient figures of animals in action or in repose, but no monsters, no animals attacking other animals. As with every general rule, there are exceptions in the col- lection, but emerging from Dr. Mildenberg's ebullient op- timism are the most endearing rationalizations for these exceptions. After all, the dolphin [192] might not be eating the octopus, he might be disgorging it after having found it distasteful. (p. 1) The collector, readers are assured, is both a numismatic scholar and a romantic, both gregarious and quite modest.... (He) has lived through great ad- versity in his life; he has also enjoyed many of its sweeter moments. All of these facets are apparent in his animal collection from the comic quacking duck lamp [165] to the somber and introverted "Tragic Ape" [122]. (p. 1) Romantic that Dr. Mildenberg is, he has made his "an- imals" available so that we might share his pleasure in view- ing them. As he often says when showing one, ''Here, take it in your hands. Look at it! It speaks to you!" (p. 1)</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Field ArchaeologylVol. 11, 1984 71 Leo Mildenberg, in the effusive descriptions in this volume, sounds like a charming and generous host, a kind and gentle person, whose collection, we are as- sured, reflects his personality and his personal interests. His pacific nature leads to "endearing rationalizations" of the exceptions in his collectio'n. Clearly, he believes in the ability of an object to communicate independently of its historical context ("Look at it! It speaks to you!"). We shall expect to find in the collection no monsters, no scenes of violence, and no humans, except those ac- companying non-human animals. One may conclude that groups of artifacts including such offending specimens would be broken up, if they were offered for sale as having been found together, and Mildenberg would se- lect for his collection only those depicting non-violent, non-human animals. The other members of such a group might find a home in the collection of someone less selective, or with different tastes. The collection was not constrained by time period, since the objects even in the exhibition reputedly range from the 4th millennium s.c. to Islamic times. The geo- graphical interests seem to be the Middle East and the littoral countries of the eastern Mediterranean. On the other hand, specifics on the country of origin seem not to have been required to render objects eligible for ac- quisition. Such a requirement, at any rate, is not men- tioned in discussions of the criteria for acquisition, and there is no specific, single provenience (in an archaeo- logical sense) offered for any object in the entire catalog. We may presume that reliable information on proveni- ence simply was not available either for the authors or for Mildenberg. Any knowledge about the date or cul- tural context of an object in a collection so constrained, therefore, can only be gleaned from the nature of the individual objects; the objects must communicate di- rectly to us. The archaeological context, presumably, is unknowable. We may now turn to the catalog. The first 15 objects in the catalog (la-o) are identified as a "Group of Animal Sculptures with Intaglios." A single, general description is provided for all. Dickite stone. Anatolia or Iran, said to have been found north of Lake Van, Neolithic Period, late 4th millennium B.C. (p. 9) Dimensions follow: heights range 1.8-12.5 cm; widths 1. 8-4. 3 cm; lengths 4. 8-22 cm. The more detailed descriptions and photographs that follow are of figures that fit reasonably well with the pacific nature of most of the other Mildenberg animals. Subjects include a running dog or wolf, a fox, nesting quail and other birds, turtles, the head of a "bear," and possibly a snail or worm. Intaglios, usually on the bot- toms of these small figures, include representations of birds, bent human figures, and four-legged animals, in- cluding leaping deer or antelope (?). The implication in the initial heading is that these ob- jects were found together or at least were found at the same site, despite the fact that the provenience ("said to have been found . . .") is cited as "north of Lake Van" in "Anatolia or Iran," a vast region of sw Asia. Another question comes to mind, however, even if the objects could, for the sake of argument, be proved to have been found together some place, any place: is the "group" complete? The author offers us no assurance from her source that the "group" was complete within the Mil- denberg collection, or that all the associated figures in his collection were selected for the exhibition. And there are other peculiarities about the "group." Following the purely descriptive catalog there is a brief essay, the be- ginning of which contains an astonishing speculation and some curious revelations. This is an extraordinary group of objects probably deriving from a culture that is not yet known. The fact that these small stone animals are difficult to identify and, indeed, make up part of a unique find has caused some scholars to doubt their authenticity. (p. 16) (Emphasis added.) The identification of a previously unknown culture on the basis of 15 figurines depicting animals is almost breathtaking in its boldness.l3 It seems all the more so in view of the statement that some scholars "doubt their authenticity," while still other scholars have suggested dates for them from the 1st to 4th millennium s.c. The scholars in either category, we note, are not named, and the objects are "of a type never before published." The author and at least some of those anonymous scholars seem to have evidence that is not to be shared with the readers. For example, in the second sentence in the pre- vious quote the objects are said to "make up part of a unique find . . ."; that they do so is a "fact." Does this expression mean, as we might have suspected, that 13. Some of the large-eyed, anthropomorphic terracotta figures that were found in 1968-1969 at Mycenae might with equal reason (or lack of reason) have been attnbuted to "a culture that is not yet known" had they simply appeared in the antiquities market bearing a similar pedigree (e.g., "said to be from SE Europe, north of the Ar- golic Bay . . ."). That is, they are unlike any other representations so far known among the Mediterranean cultures of the Late Bronze Age. We are fortunate that they were recovered in an archaeological excavation, so that not only is their provenience certain, but their archaeological context was documented. The figures were found, along with distinctively Mycenaean artifacts, in a shrine of the 13th century B.C. in the Citadel House during excavations directed by Lord William Taylor; see Miriam Ervin, "News Letter from Greece," AJA 73 (1969) 346-347, pl. 88, figs. 18-20.</page><page sequence="6">72 Scholarship and Provenience in the Study of ArtifactslWiseman subjects offensive to Mildenberg were indeed excised from the "group" and acquired by other collectors and dealers? Readers might well reach that conclusion con- sidering the references to other objects "of this group" in the collection of Norbert Schimmel of New York City (p. 17). Or were "unique" or "find" not used in a literal sense? Some scholars, we are told, doubt their authenticity. It would be interesting and useful to know not only their identities, but their grounds for doubt. To say the least, it is questionable scholarship to offer as a "group" in- dividual objects attributed anonymously to some place in a vast region and to refer to a debate by anonymous scholars on the authenticity and date of those objects. What scholarship requires is evidence for attributions, for chronology, for cultural implications. But if we seek evidence in the paragraphs that follow the stunning open- ing of the essay, we shall find chiefly disappointment. The strongest evidence for the antiquity of the objects is the report (p. 17) of various analyses performed by A. John Gwinnett and Leonard Gorelick (SUNY, Stony Brook) on several objects from the "group" and a sim- ilar object from the collection of Norbert Schimmel. We may summarize their report as follows: a contemporary forger could have fashioned the figures and used flint drills for the intaglios, but that possibility is unlikely because 1) extensive weathering is disceined over po- lishing marks on the objects; 2) dickite "would be very difficult to weather artificially"; and 3) dickite is known to be available from the region of the Caspian Sea. The analyses are hardly conclusive, and the scientists venture no conjecture (here, at least) on the date. How long would have been required for the "weathering'': two years? two millennia? six millennia? Granting the diJ%iculty of artificially "weathering" the objects is not the same as granting that it was impossible. And dickite, of course, is found in many parts of the world. 14 The other evidence presented is in the realms of per- sonal impression and stylistic comparisons. Neither in- spires confidence in this case. We are informed that: The approach to the sculpture suggests a Neolithic aesthetic. (p. 16) 14. More details on the analyses are provided by A. John Gwinnett and Leonard Gorelick, "Authenticity Analysis of Two Stone Statu- ettes in the Mildenberg Collection," MASCA Journal 2:3 (December, 1982) 88-90. Dickite is a clay mineral of the kaolinite group; see Anna O. Shepard, Ceramics for the Archaeologist. CarnlnstPub 609 (1968) 375. "Dickite is formed by hydrothermal solutions and occurs quite commonly as a secondary clay in the pores of sandstones . . . also in coal beds . . . and in geodes . . ."; Charles E. Weaver and Lin D. Pollard, The Chemistry of Clay Minerals (Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company: Amsterdam, London, New York 1973) 145. Perhaps. But then again, perhaps not. The aesthetics of Neolithic societies (i.e., food-producing, non-urban so- cieties, which usually were sedentary or semi-nomadic; they are characterized by material cultures sufficiently complex to reflect the various elements of their societal systems) are far from being universal or timeless. And yet the comparative material offered by the author (pp. 16-17) ranges from Egypt in the sw, to Lake Van in the NE, to Mesopotamia in the south, and to China, far to the east! What is more, the "Neolithic" in the Near East alone lasted in some areas for as long as 4,500 years.ls In any case, the proffered characterization by the author of an aesthetic that might cover that span of time, that enormous region, and the numerous cultures subsumed under those broad headings of times and places, is too simplistic to carry conviction. There is a double standard of scholarship evident in the presentation of these small figurines. However in- adequate we might find Kozloff's comparanda for the conclusions she reaches, readers will note that compar- ative literature is at least cited: author, publication, pub- lisher, year, and even the numbers of pages or figures. On key matters such as provenience, authenticity, and chronology, however, the sources are not only anony- mous (except for Gwinnett and Gorelick on their possible authenticity), there is the implicit, but clear, expectation that readers will not be troubled by the absence of evi- dence. The double standard, I think, does not serve well. Since Kozloff is prepared to accept and publish the pro- venience as attributed, she should be prepared to back it up with her source. Who said the objects were ". . . found north of Lake Van . . ."? What evidence was adduced that convinced her that they were found there? Most importantly, why should the reader not have the right to judge the quality of that evidence as well as the stylistic comparanda offered? It is true that it has become the practice for dealers, collectors, museums, and collaborating scholars to doc- ument only the stylistic and, sometimes, the technical aspects of their studies; for the rest, faith in unnamed sources is required from other scholars. In this respect, the presentation by Kozloff is not exceptional; it is one example (dramatic on other grounds) of common prac- tice in the art trade. But scholarship is not a simple act of faith; evidence for assertions, in general, is required, and there are criteria for judging the quality of the evi- dence. The practice just identified, in my view, does not merit the acceptance it has received either among ar- chaeologists or art historians. And the general silence of 15. Ca. 8500-4000 B.C.; see, e.g., Charles L. Redman, The Rise of Civilization (W. H. Freeman and Company: San Francisco 1978) 2- 5.</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Field ArchaeologylVol. 11, 1984 73 other scholars within the disciplines involved-I mean scholars who do not follow that practice can be mis- taken at least for tolerance, or even as approval. It is incumbent upon a profession to define and protect its own professional standards. An Issue of Scholarship The figurines of little animals discussed in the pre- vious section may or may not be ancient; they may or may not be from "north of Lake Van;" and they may or may not represent a "culture that is not yet known." The evidence presented by Kozloff is inconclusive re- garding the first set of alternatives, and altogether lack- ing for the second and third. Such uncertainty, however, should distress no one whose chief conceins are for the personal aesthetic grat- ification the objects might offer either through their sub- ject matter or their appearance. The craftsmanship of forgeries and copies is often superb, and might well ex- cel that of an object actually made in the time period represented. Some readers will be reminded, in that re- gard, of the periodic debates over the date of the statue of Hermes holding the infant Dionysus found a century ago at Olympia in Greece. Some have argued that it is an original by the great Praxiteles of the 4th century s.c., others that it is by a lesser known Praxiteles of the 2nd century B.C., others that it is a Roman copy, and some hold still other views.l6 The late Gisela M.A. Richter, one of the leading scholars of Greek art of this century and a proponent of the 4th-century date, once pro- claimed: If the Hermes is a Roman copy, henceforth it is Roman copies we must collect, not Greek originals. 17 The emotionalism of the assertion contributed nothing to the scholarly debate over the chronology and style, and the archaeological context (in this instance, known!) provided no stronger support for one position than for another. But the comment of Richter has remained for some of us a powerful reminder not only of the difficulty of distinguishing some copies from originals, but also that such discrimination is not always necessary for aes- 16. The statue was found in 1877 in the Heraeum where it had been seen and noted by Pausanias (v.17.3) in the 2nd century A.C.; see Gisela M.A. Richter, The Sculpture and Sculptors of the Greeks, new rev. edn. (Yale University Press: New Haven and London 1950) 259- 260, figs. 664-665. A number of the differing views are represented in a series of articles published in the AJA 35 (1931), issue no. 3. 17.

Her remark also is illustrative of the role that personal aesthetic response to ancient art can play even in purely scholarly investigations. How much greater a role it plays in the minds (and spirits) of those collectors whose aesthetic sensibilities have not been tempered by years of scholarly inquiry, we may only . . maglne. The purpose of this discussion is not, of course, to deny the value of aesthetics in the study and especially the appreciation of ancient artifacts (or ancient thoughts!), but rather to point up the danger of confusing different kinds of evidence or, to continue an earlier metaphor, of misunderstanding the "communication" from the ob- ject when it "speaks" to us. That is, unless we are wary, when the object "speaks" to us, it is likely to do so, like the English-speaking ghost of the ancient Greek mariner at Glastonbury,l8 in our own language and, in- deed, in our own cultural dialect: the voice we hear may be our own. If it is the original cultural context of the object that we want to understand, then we must be especially care- ful that the aesthetic responses of another culture in an- other age (our own or some other) are not confused with those that may have been elicited from members of the society for which the artifacts were made. To put this argument in concrete terms, we might profitably study the role of the Parthenon in the context of the Athenian society of the 5th century B.C. when it was created; in present-day Greek society; or in the context of any in- termediate cultural period. In comparative terms, we shall note that not only its function (temple of Athena, Chris- tian church, Turkish mosque, school for girls, powder magazine, tourist attraction), but also its symbolism has varied over the millennia, and so have the human re- sponses to its presence. The Mildenberg animals of Kozloff's new culture, then, like the too numerous objects from the "Ziwiye trea- sure," may amuse us, or move us in some emotional way, or prompt some intellectual fantasy; they may even "speak" to us. But if we are to understand them in their own voice, not the one we lend them, we must first learn their cultural dialect; otherwise we risk confusing not only ourselves but others. In the case of the Mildenberg animals, we might even thus contribute to the growth of the "group," of this "unique find," in a manner that parallels the expansion of the marvelous "Ziwiye trea- sure." The growth, in fact, has already begun. On October 19, 1982, a year after the publication of selected objects from the Mildenberg collection, the Ed- ward H. Merrin Gallery in New York City opened an 18.

The handsome color poster advertising the exhibition shows three figurines of little birds similar to those published by Kozloff. They are in the company of 11 small sculptures depicting humanlike figures carved in the same or similar material. Two of the anthropo- morphic figurines have a peaked headdress, while the others have bald, smoothed pates; a few are bearded. Perhaps most important is the presence of intaglios on the humanlike figurines that are similar to the intaglios published by Kozloff. The identification on the poster of the provenience ("Anatolia"), and the dating to "3000 B.C.," are con- veniently in line with the attributions Kozloff accepted and published. The presence of humanlike figures in the picture on the poster is a curious, and, I suspect, not coincidental expansion of the repertoire of the "group" as represented in the severely constrained Mildenberg collection. By the time of the writing of the final draft of this essay (December, 1983) word had reached me of the acquisition of other similar objects by museums on both the east and west coasts of the United States. We may be certain that some scholars are still being invited to debate the authenticity, provenience, and date of these objects. Whether or not these closed debates will serve any purpose other than determining a new market value for the objects remains to be seen. Collateral laboratory analyses might show the objects to be fakes. If so, we might wonder if the scholars and museum officials will publicly announce that they were duped by sellers of forged artifacts. On the other hand, the same analyses might show the objects to be ancient. If so, we might wonder with what public expression of pride the scholars and museum officials involved will reconcile such recent acquisitions with their previous statements of support for the UNESCO Convention (see the letter by White cited in note 1). Or will they maintain that these objects reached the art market in some manner that did not contravene the UNESCO Convention? Let us suppose, just for a moment, that none of these objects is a fake, that they are all genuine, and are all from some place in the region of Lake Van. The fact that none has ever before been published or even referred to in a publication (or sales catalog?), is an indication that they are, indeed, new to the market. There is at least one similar object now in the Schimmel collection, though none was included in either of the volumes de- voted to his collection, one of which appeared as recently as 1978.'9 19. Oscar White Muscarella, ed., AncientArt: The Norbert Schimmel Collection (Philipp von Zabern: Mainz 1974); Jurgen Settgast, ed., In the silence of archaeologists, native or foreign, who have worked in Turkey or Iran during the past six years, we may be sure that the objects were not recovered in a legitimate archaeological excavation. The objects must have been recovered either accidentally, say by a farmer at work in the field, or dug up in an organized clandes- tine activity within the last five or six years. (The reader should bear in mind that we are still supposing that the objects are genuine.) We need not pause to speculate here on how the ob- jects found their way out of Turkey, or Iran, or else- where, and into the collections where their existence has been called to our attention, for there is a more serious implication to consider. Whether or not the initial dis- covery was accidental, we may be sure that further growth of the "group" and the repertoire will not be: more than one such accident is beyond coincidence. And we may expect the objects to be sought out, since they have al- ready been shown to have a value in the marketplace of antiquities. The publication by Kozloff insures, even en- hances their monetary value. In view of the growth of the "group" by late 1983, then, if any of the objects are genuine, we may find it difficult to avoid the implication that an ancient site some place has been plundered, and perhaps still is being plundered. The timing, after all, is convenient for such activities: both Turkey and Iran are afflicted with severe internal problems, and Iran is at war with Iraq. The concerns of the three preceding paragraphs, the reader will recall, follow from our supposing for the moment that the objects are genuine and from the broad, generalized provenience attributed. The objects, how- ever, may all be fakes, and our concerns about the plun- dering of an ancient site, therefore, may be misplaced. But if they are fakes, or if any of them are, there are other, still serious implications for scholarship. For one thing, Kozloff's new culture is now a part of the schol- arly literature and, like the Piltdown Man, it cannot be expunged. Even if every object on which the identifi- cation of the "culture" now rests were eventually proved to be a modern forgery, exhaustive studies of Near East- ern prehistory would still need to cite the "culture," if only to deny its existence. Forgers of antiquities will also be encouraged to add to the repertoire because of their success in the marketplace. Ethics and Scholarship Paul M. Bator, Bromley Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and now Deputy Solicitor-General of the Von Troja bis Amarna: The Norbert Schimmel Collection, New York (Philipp von Zabern: Mainz 1978).</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 11, 1984 75 United States, has recently argued for full disclosure re- garding museum acquisitions. The entire atmosphere of "no questions asked, no infor- mation given" surrounding the art trade is antithetical to the obligation of museums to aid the study and understanding of art, an obligation which requires an aggressive search for and a full disclosure of information about the origin and history of a work of art.20 Bator comments at the beginning of a lengthy footnote (146) to the preceding as follows. The most striking thing to a lawyer who comes upon the art world is how deep and uncritical is the assumption that transactions within it should normally be are certainly en- titled to be secret. Bator then proceeds to counter effectively, in my view, the arguments that have been raised to justify the secrecy and to deny disclosure; e.g., that the museums are pro- tecting the privacy of the donor because of the donor's shyness or possible embarrassment, etc. He concludes as follows. One suspects, however, that privacy is sometimes designed to facilitate tax cheating. In any event, it seems to me that the interests favoring disclosure are so clear and weighty that the tradition of privacy at least when dealing with a public institution such as a museum-should give way. Bator's cogent arguments are applicable on a broader scale. Scholarship, too, would be better served by less anonymity in the attribution of provenience than is now customary in the publication of artifacts in museums or private collections. Why should scholars not seek to ver- ify or disallow attributed provenience with the same con- cern that they show in investigating stylistic connections or age? Why should they not be expected to do so? And why should they not document in the publication the results of their investigation? Why should they not offer a specific assessment of the reliability of their sources? Why, indeed, should they not name those sources? The questions above are not intended to be rhetorical; it would be interesting and illuminating to hear some answers from scholars who publish non-archaeological collections. We might suspect that a common response would be that serious attempts to verify the provenience attributed to an object by a seller would be impractical, a waste of time. Perhaps so (as we shall see below), but it would, again, be illuminating to learn why they would 20. The International Trade in Art (University of Chicago Press: Chi- cago 1983) 84. consider such efforts impractical. We may well imagine that some collectors and curators, to say nothing of the dealers who supply them, are not likely to be eager to open their books and reveal so publicly the sources of the antiquities in their possession, as Paul Bator has em- phasized. An appeal to scholarship may not persuade them; they may not care to have their own (or their sources') reliability assessed in an objective manner. What is more, such inquiries are likely to raise questions of ethics or legality that could hinder publication, or halt it altogether, depending on how the scholar or the pub- lisher resolves such problems. The accepted practice of publishing an anonymously attributed provenience allows the scholar to remain at a more or less comfortable distance from the realities of current acquisition of new antiquities; that is, not merely "new" to the market, but fresh from the field. I em- phasize "new" because it is those objects that are par- ticularly at issue here, not objects that truly are from "an old established collection in ...." (The phrase has become a cynical euphemism for any objects pur- chased in the antiquities market.) It is important to keep in mind, in this regard, that the nature and the size of the antiquities market changed years ago, so that the market has become a major threat to the study of antiquity. And the changes have brought about a change also in the relationship between many scholars and those who are active in the market. The size, the destructiveness, and the money now involved in what used to be a relatively innocuous trade have turned the scholar, who would only authenticate a piece, into an accomplice. His opinion, however cautiously given, may determine the market value of a piece.2' What is more, the plundering of ancient sites has greatly increased in order to provision the expanding market.22 The situation now simply is not the same as it was even a generation ago. The dangers to the world's cultural heritage posed by the antiquities market were not only lesser in degree, they were also less clearly perceived. We might wonder what would be the effect on schol- 21.

What would scholars do if, in veri- fying the provenience of objects they wanted to publish, their investigations led them to smugglers and clandes- tine diggers? In what scholarly discourse would they en- gage? How would they assess statements of provenience, or associations ("group," "a royal tomb," etc.), or chronology (!) from such persons, even if they could obtain the statements directly from the individuals? Is this the area of impracticality: where, even if the indi- vidual(s) responsible for the removal of the objects from the ground or the country of origin could be found, they would be unlikely to provide credible testimony? But if it is not their claims of provenience being passed on even in the current practice, the attributed provenience can only be one that was completely fabricated, or guessed at, or altered by an intermediary, and so deserving even of less credence. Few ancient objects in the marketplace, in fact, can be traced with any degree of reliability beyond the sell- er's shop, or sometimes even beyond the buyer's door, because the line of supply almost invariably involves clandestine digging and destruction, or theft, or smug- gling, or all three. The forging of a provenience along that line might be done to protect the resident diggers, or in order not to attract attention to the site being plun- dered, or because, by assigning a well-known but false provenience, the market value of the objects might be enhanced. There are indeed numerous reasons why par- ties active in supplying antiquities for the market might choose to forge a provenience; we may never know them all. Truth is not to be expected from them. Here, then, is the impracticality of the search for pro- venience of such artifacts. The sources are not credible: not to scholars, not to the public at large. But the reasons that the sources are not credible are unlikely to be dis- cussed by those dealers, or collectors, or museums who acquire the objects. For them, "impracticality," one may suppose, would serve as a useful euphemism, a term not to be too clearly defined. And if they themselves had direct knowledge of the provenience (I mean culpable knowledge), they, too, might be prepared to falsify a provenience in order to avoid prosecution, or demands by foreign governments for the restitution of antiquities illegally taken from their lands. And a forged prove- nience, whether adopted to protect the supplier or the scholar, is an unacceptable resolution, both on moral and scholarly grounds. Scholars need to reassess, in my view, the ways in which they study ancient objects, especially those that are claimed to be, or are thought to be, items new to the market. We need also to reassess the standards we as scholars require ourselves and others to meet. The se- crecy that has been practiced with wide acceptance in the past is no longer appropriate, all claims of impract- icality aside. Forging a provenience, or covering a known provenience with a broader term to avoid self-incrimi- nation (or for whatever reason), is not only a corruption of scholarship, but is at least unethical behavior, and can be illegal. Scholarship and ethics here cannot be sepa- rated. The ethical problems that not only scholars, but col- lectors, dealers, and curators (some of whom, of course, are scholars themselves) are now confronting would per- haps not loom so large if they were not so new. It is, after all, only within the last 15-20 years that industrial and urban development, coupled with the excesses of the antiquities market, so impressed both scholars and the public with the need to protect the world's cultural her- itage from destruction that a general ethical position be- gan to be developed.23 That position is reflected in the exclusion from the programs of the Annual Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America any primary pre- sentation of artifacts acquired in contravention of the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property.24 That policy was ex- tended in 1978 to articles and notes submitted to the American Journal of Archaeology,25 and in 1981 addi- tional restrictions were placed on the review of books that offered primary publication of such material.26 The position, however, has nowhere been more forcefully 23. Paul Bator, op. cit. (in note 20) 1, refers to the article by Coggins that is cited in the preceding note as "an important milestone in the recent history of concern about illegal trade in art treasures." I agree. There have been a number of other milestones since, from the UNESCO Convention in 1970 to implementing legislation in the United States, which was signed into law in January, 1983. 24. The resolution was adopted by the Council of the A.I.A. on December 30, 1973; Bulletin of the Archaeological Institute of America 65 (New York 1974) 30; cf. Brunilde S. Ridgway and Tamara Stech, "Editorial Letter," AJA 86 (1982) 1-2. 25. The full statement is as follows. "In accordance with the reso- lutions on illegal excavation and trade passed by the AIA Council in 1973 . . . we shall reject articles and notes on objects in private or public collections purchased after December 30, 1973, if without ped- igree as parts of previously existing collections or documentation as legal exports from the country of origin."

Vitelli, in her "Editorial Note," AJA 85 (1981) 343, made it clear that the editorial policy stated in 1978 had been taken since that time to exclude reviews of "publications clearly devoted to undocumented or illicitly exported objects." She then adds: "When, however, reviewers recognize the inclusion of such material in books which they are reviewing, it would be useful if they would indicate . their necessarily diminished and/or suspect archaeological value."</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 11, 1984 77 articulated than in the Journal of Field Archaeology, both in one of its regular features, "The Antiquities Market," and in one of the founding principles both of the Journal and the Association for Field Archaeology: its stated commitment to "the protection of antiquities, including the opposition to the dealing and the illicit traffic in such materials. S v27 Fully satisfactory and effective resolutions of the prob- lems touched on in this essay, however, have escaped us. Full disclosure on acquisitions, though not yet agreed to by museums, may be forced upon public institutions by public pressure, if the public can be convinced that it is in the public interest to do so. But private institu- tions, collectors, dealers, and scholars are, in varying degrees, less susceptible to that pressure. Full disclosure, in any case, will not help with historical reconstructions if the source is not credible (e.g., smugglers, tomb rob- bers, and other felons), though it would surely discour- age more institutions from dealing with such sources. Perhaps our options need not be limited to simple al- ternatives: e.g., to publish or not to publish artifacts that lack a verifiable pedigree. There are ethical and scholarly problems with both, though the position taken in this essay has been one close to the latter alternative. While having no hesitation whatever in agreeing fully with the view reflected in the comments by Perrot that were quoted early in this paper, and abhorring the secrecy that pro- tects the plunderers, I am still troubled by the possibility of the willful loss of knowledge. How, for example, shall we advise other scientists conservators, experts in archaeometry, and others who often are asked to conserve or analyze artifacts of unknown provenience? Although their analyses (e.g., some resulting in a veri- fication of antiquity) might benefit participants in the art trade or otherwise encourage the plundering of sites, the same analyses can provide useful and even important information for a variety of ancient studies. And what shall we do with a Rosetta Stone, should one appear without context? Is there an ethical way to obviate the possibility of an irretrievable loss of worthwhile knowledge? It seems to me that this fabric of interwoven issues of scholarship and ethics still merits our consideration and open dis- cussion.28 Your comments are invited.
