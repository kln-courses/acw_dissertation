<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Asia Minor MACHTELD J. MELLINK PLATES 31-38 1972 in Anatolian archaeology was a year of gradually emerging trends and contexts rather than of spectacular discoveries. It is possible, as usual, to point to the rich finds of late classical sculpture and architecture which Aphrodisias and Perge con- tribute, and to the protection of similar finds at Cremna and Sagalassos; or to the steadily grow- ing information on characteristic Anatolian temple architecture and local cults from the seventh cen- tury in Bayrakll-Old Smyrna to late survivals in Hellenistic and Roman times (Pessinus, Kapikaya near Pergamon). It is, however, at the other end of the development, in the earliest periods of Ana- tolian cultures that the gains in basic information are forthcoming, slowly allowing us to work with some solid facts rather than pure conjectures. The work of several expeditions in the Keban area has now reached Chalcolithic levels with glimpses here and there of Neolithic. At 9aydnii near Ergani an aceramic settlement is coming to light in several well-stratified stages. The results are encouraging. 9ayonii has a well-developed ar- chitecture which shares some traits with Neolithic sites elsewhere but its general appearance seems to be of local character. In the Chalcolithic sites of the Keban area and also at Malatya, samples of architecture and small finds encourage one to think in terms of cultural complexes with considerable in- terrelations. Norsuntepe is a fortified site (town?); mudbrick houses are finished with plaster and in some instances have wall paintings (samples found at Norsuntepe and Malatya; cf. Tepecik, Tiilintepe, K6rtepe for other material of this period). The pot- tery of the sites excavated down to the Late Chalco- lithic levels is of Amuq F affinity, i.e. chronologi- cally of the Late Uruk period and geographically related to pottery styles which extend from East Anatolia to North Mesopotamia, North Syria and Cilicia. The ceramic similarities are so striking that a considerable amount of interaction must be as- sumed for the regions concerned in about the sec- ond half of the fourth millennium B.c. It is very much to be hoped that one of the relevant Keban sites can be excavated over a large area for this period, because we lack an investigation in width so far (samples only are known from e.g. the Amuq, Tilmen Hiiyiik, and Tarsus and Mersin in Cilicia). The period is "preliterate" but may overlap with the "protoliterate" stage in Mesopo- tamia; the diffusion of early literacy is another problem which could receive light from East Anatolia. The Early Bronze Age in East Anatolia has its urban and political aspects. One notices the citadel and palatial stronghold of Norsuntepe in Early Bronze III; one wonders about the regional de- velopment from Early Bronze II to the III stage, and how it compares with the archaeological data from central and West Anatolia where certain forced realignments seem to have taken place at the end of Early Bronze II. It is regrettable that so few Bronze Age excavations are in progress in the western half of Anatolia. The site of Kara- hiiyiik-Konya which is in contact with the West is yielding a very useful sequence of ceramic evidence for the study of interconnections in the third mil- lennium B.c. The special study by Peter Spanos, Untersuchung iiber den bei Homer "depas amphi- kypellon" genannten Gefdsstypus (IstMitt Beiheft 6, Tiibingen 1972) has a bearing upon the ceramic evidence for these connections. For the Middle Bronze Age, we have more evi- dence. Iasos and Miletus are beginning to show that substantial Minoan contacts preceded the My- cenaean expansion to the west coast of Anatolia. The detailed study of the submerged Middle Bronze Age levels will show to what extent Minoan foundation legends are based on fact, but in any case cultural contacts between the Middle Minoan I-II palace regime and the kingdoms of South- western Anatolia are to be taken seriously now. This is the period also of affinities in glyptic art from Knossos to Konya and Acemhiiyiik, and from there to North Syria; the archaeological cli- mate seems right for some historical interaction to be discovered in the coming seasons of excava- tion.

The Late Bronze Age is a period of population shifts and abandonment of old sites; we need the study of continuing or newly-founded sites to un- derstand the Hittite Empire period archaeologi- cally. Hattusha and Alaca are the major core sites; new evidence from the Black Sea region and from the South (Meydancik, Ilgin) can be expected from the explorations and excavations in progress; one hopes for more from the land of Ishuwa (Korucu- tepe-Keban), and perhaps some day also from Gor- dion in the west. The debate on the chronology of Hittite texts and its implications for Hittite his- tory is continuing, cf. O. Carruba, Zeitschrift fuir vergleichende Sprachforschung 85 (1971) 226-241, in answer to A. Kammenhuber's "Die Sprachstufen des Hethitischen" in the same periodical 83 (i969) 256-289. For the neo-Hittite and Phrygian periods, new enterprises at Nigde and Yenidogan will be able to add substantial evidence for the Eastern and West- ern aspects of historical Iron Age cultures in Anatolia. Scholars still wait eagerly for the full pub- lication of Karatepe, where sculptures and inscrip- tions have been pieced together with patience and elaborate care. We now have a general study of the corpus of neo-Hittite sculpture by Winfried Orthmann, Untersuchungen zur spdthethitischen Kunst (Bonn 197i). The progress of excavations in Turkey is also recorded in TiirkArkDerg 19:I-2 (1970); Belleten 143 (1972) 417-432 (=TTKR 1971); AnatSt 21 (i97I) 5-58. The reports which follow are again based on the information and illustrations, guid- ance and discussions generously provided by the excavators, museum directors and archaeological authorities in Turkey. My profound debt to them is gratefully acknowledged. PALAEOLITHIC, NEOLITHIC, CHALCOLITHIC SITES KARAIN. Professor Killq Ktkten kindly reports that he continued his work in the palaeolithic cave at Karain in 1972. He examined a series of stratified deposits from Early Bronze Age through Meso- lithic to Upper and Middle Palaeolithic. There was much fossilized debris containing animal bones and shells of turtles, crabs and snails. The sounding will be continued in I973. 9ATALHUYUK. In AnatSt 21 (1971) 77-98, J. Law- rence Angel discusses demography and pathology of Early Neolithic skeletons from 9atal Hiiyiik. KONYA AREA. A palaeoecological survey started in the Konya area in 1968 is briefly described by Har- old C. Cohen in AnatSt 21 (197i) 15- KAYSERI AREA. A selection of Neolithic material from the Kayseri area is on display in the new Kayseri museum and will be published by Director Mehmet Eskio'lu. KEBAN. Professor Kiliq Ktkten published his palaeolithic finds in Keban Reports 1969, 13-21 and Keban Reports 1970, 1-5- Dr. Ufuk Esin kindly reports that an open air station is attested near the edges of Pinarlar-Pulur near Pertek, where Old Palaeolithic coarse flint</page><page sequence="3">1973] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 171 tools have been found; the mound itself is Chal- colithic and Early Bronze. KEBAN. TiULIN TEPE. Dr. Ufuk Esin also reports that in 1971 and 1972 she excavated Tiilin Tepe, a small mound c. 20 km. E of Elizlg, almost com- pletely carried off by railroad builders before the days of the Keban project. "Because the upper levels were gone, we could readily reach Late and Middle Chalcolithic strata, but ground water appeared at I.50-2.00 m. beneath the modern surface. Two female figurines came from the Middle Chalcolithic strata (pl. 31, fig. 7). Some of the pottery was painted in Halaf and Ubaid style; it appeared with dark-faced burnished and impressed wares. A house yielded over 9oo microliths. Much burnt wheat and charcoal were collected. "Near a round hearth or oven of mudbrick we found copper ore and slag; the pottery here was chaff-faced simple ware. A round stone-lined well(?) goes down into the Chalcolithic strata; this has not yet been emptied but its contents so far were Early Bronze and Chalcolithic pottery and animal bones. "The mound also had Hittite, Iron Age, and Medieval occupation." KEBAN. K6RTEPE. Dr. Harald Hauptmann in 1972 made a sounding in K6rtepe, a mound E of the village of Habusu, cf. Keban Reports 1968, No. 055/a,b. He kindly reports the following: "The mound was cut through by the old road from Elazl~ to Bing6l. Surface sherds indicate habitation from Chalcolithic to Iron Age. The N part of the mound had been stripped down by road builders to Early Chalcolithic levels. A 9 x 4 m. sounding of I m. depth established four levels. In the upper level lay a house with round hearth; in level 2, mudbrick walls forming part of two rooms; in level 3, a rectangular hearth and burnt floor with charred grain; in level 4, again mudbrick house walls. "The pottery of these levels resembles that at Tiilin Tepe. It is chaff-tempered, mostly thick ware with a light to dark brown or grey, some- times polished surface. The shapes are jars, some with double curved profiles, many with offset rims and with characteristic large handle-knobs or hori- zontal ledge-handles, sometimes notched. Also found is fine black-polished or dark grey ware. There are some painted Halaf sherds (Amuq C), one steatopygous seated idol, and an obsidian tanged arrowhead." KEBAN AREA. For other important Chalcolithic evidence cf. below under Malatya and Norsuntepe, Bronze Age sites. QAY6NiU. The fourth season of excavation took place in the fall of 1972. Professors Haletr ambel and R. J. Braidwood kindly report that of the four or five habitation levels, the lowest consists mainly of refuse pits. The rectangular houses with stone foundations in "grill" plan belong to the next phase (4). Seven such structures have been excavated. They measure about 18 x 22 feet. In the level above this (3), the polished floors with "terrazzo" paving occur. Level 2 is burnt, its houses had stone founda- tions with mudbrick superstructure. Level I is poorly preserved. The site was aceramic through most of its exist- ence. The small finds consist of chipped flint, ob- sidian, ground stone, and some fragments of beaten native copper. In addition, ample material was collected for zoological and botanical analysis. BRONZE AGE SITES KULTEPE. Professor Tahsin Ozgiiq kindly reports the following on a long season of excavations in 1972. The basic project remains the clearance of the burnt palace in the center of the city mound and its enclosure walls. There are two levels of construction, as previously reported (AJA 73 [1969] 205-206; 74 [1970] I60; 75 [I971] 164), correspond- ing to Karum levels Ib and II, respectively. Both the upper and lower palaces were destroyed by con- flagration; both were of monumental size. The lower palace in plan resembles the upper palace, but it differs somewhat in building technique (less prolific use of stone). The lower palace was filled in and leveled before the level Ib palace was built. Both palaces yielded stratified cuneiform tablets and seal impressions (stamps and cylinders). In the walls of the upper palace, embedded in the mortar, were broken tablet fragments, presumably originally from the level II palace. The seals and bullae found in the rooms of the upper palace are dated to the Ib period by Professor Nimet Ozgiig. The palaces in the center of the mound of Kanesh had their separate citadel-like enclosures. The w and N sides of the enclosure walls have been exposed over long distances. The walls meet at right angles at the Nw corner. The upper level wall has short buttresses of stone, wood, and mud-</page><page sequence="4">172 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 77 brick projecting at regular intervals; the lower wall (4 m. thick) has shallow offsets; the stones used for the inner citadel walls are large slabs of andesite quarried in the vicinity; many blocks are 1-1.50 m. long. Both levels of the citadel wall were burnt and have remnants of structural timber. Stratified burnt debris lies against the plastered wall faces. The conflagrations of the royal (inner) citadel correspond to those of the outer citadel (the Kanesh mound) and those of Karum II and Ib, respectively; the events which caused these devas- tations concerned all of Kanesh and its suburbs. In the habitation trench in the w part of the mound, smaller structures of the Ib period were investigated. This area continues to produce inter- esting small finds, such as fragments of a gold and rock crystal lion in 1972. The lion is couchant and pierced lengthwise as a bead; the eyes were inlaid and had thin gold rims. In the Karum, important buildings evidently stood opposite the w and sw sides of the city mound. Along the E side, private houses existed. In 1972 a small trench yielded Ib houses with tablets; among the small finds were a stone mold with a master-of-animals and a faience figurine of a god- dess. The fortification walls of the Karum are ex- posed in the streambed along the sw side of the site; the construction of level Ib consists of two parallel walls of large andesite blocks with shallow offsets; probably part of a casemate wall system. More excavation is planned here. The new monograph by Dr. Kutlu Emre, Ana- tolian Lead Figurines and their Stone Moulds (Ankara, Turkish Historical Society series VI, 14, 1971) discusses, in a general framework, the strati- fied lead figurines and molds from Kiiltepe, in- cluding the mold found in a Karum Ib house in 1971. Objects from the Kiiltepe excavations are now on display in three museums: the main collection at the museum in Ankara, and important selec- tions at the new museum in Kayseri and the small local museum at Kiiltepe-Karahiiyiik. A new study of the published Old Assyrian texts is K. R. Veenhof, Aspects of Old Assyrian Trade and its Terminology (Leiden 1972). GIFTLIK. A miniature gold pendant representing a Hittite seated goddess with large round hat is published by Seniz Dogan in Anadolu 14 (1970) 73-75. This fine piece comes from the vicinity of giftlik k6yii c. 30 km. NE of Kayseri; it is now in the Kayseri Museum. BOGAZK6Y. Interim reports have appeared in AnatSt 21 (1971) 21-22; TiirkArkDerg 19:i (1970) 175-186, with many illustrations; and in MDOG 10o3 (i971) Heinrich Otten publishes the royal seal impression of Tahurwaili, great king, found in Temple I in 1969. Professor K. Bittel kindly re- ports the following on the progress at Bogazk6y in 1972: "Work in Bogazk6y continued with excavations between Temple I and the so-called lower en- closure wall (I-J/i9-20o). Here we are recovering a habitation area with houses and some larger buildings which were partly abandoned when the temple was constructed in the early thirteenth century B.c. Habitation started in the Old Assyrian period and continued in several levels through the final phase of the Hittite Empire. A number of tombs was dug into this area in Hellenistic-Roman times. "The West Gate in the enclosure wall (cf. MDOG 89 [19571] 20-25) was cleared and re-exam- ined. The gate and flanking towers were re- paired with original building materials. It is pos- sible that the lower enclosure wall once formed the outer wall of the Hittite city. "Work on the objects found here in 1971 led to the complete or partial restoration of 65 vessels out of the sherds found in room 4 of house 4, w of the terrace of Temple I. These vessels must have been stacked in layers in the room which was no larger than 7 sq. m.; they had no contents. Among the shapes some can be dated to Biiyiikkale IVb, lower city 2, which gives us a chronological indica- tion for the construction of the terrace of Temple I. "A storage and study building was constructed behind the local museum in Bogazk6y (cf. MDOG Ioo [1968] 24). Sherds and other small finds are stored here in stratigraphic order and form a sup- plement to the collection on display in the museums of Bogazk6y and Ankara." ALACA HivYijK. During the 1972 season, architect Mahmut Akok kindly reports, work was resumed in the area near the Sphinx Gate and the Postern Gate. Cleaning operations in front of the Sphinx Gate brought several blocks to light, e.g. the undecorated block which Macridy had found in situ over block 3 of the w tower; fragments of other blocks; and near the E tower, the third block of the procession</page><page sequence="5">1973] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 173 along the base of that tower. This block has the lower part of two figures in long robes; the de- struction line of the reliefs on the E tower sloped down from the goddess at the corner to the right. From near the water basin once built by the vil- lagers in front of the E tower came a large block with the fragmentary relief of a boar. In the Postern Gate area, the postern was cleared and the reused stretch investigated. During the Phrygian reoccupation a building next to the Pos- tern Gate had drainage channels running into the postern; a pierced roofing block belongs to this phase. Notes by this writer on the original arrangement of the Sphinx Gate sculptures appeared in Anadolu 14 (1970) 15-27. KALINKAYA. Excavations at this site were sus- pended in 1972, cf. AJA 76 (1972) 169-I70. A col- lection of metal objects from the Early Bronze Age tombs is in the Ankara Museum: small openwork disks, animal figurines, pins, bracelets, weapons; modest counterparts of the finds from Alaca Hii- yiik. ESKIYAPAR. Director Raci Temizer of the Ankara Museum continued his program of excavations in 1972. He kindly reports that the clearance of a large surface area is now being accomplished in preparation for excavation of the Hittite levels. In the upper strata, a large Roman building and sev- eral post-Phrygian structures were found. TOPAKLI. The Italian excavations of this large mound midway between Kirsehir and Kayseri are also still concerned with classical and later levels; cf. reports by L. Polacco in TiirkArkDerg 19:I (1970) 187-200, AnatSt 21 (i971) 41-42; SMEA 8 (1969) 76-84; io (1969) 54-68; 14 (i97i) 7-37. A deep trench has been cut through the E side of the mound but the central habitation area has only been reached in its uppermost levels, with extensive Byzantine remains. HACIBEKTA?. The excavations of Professor Kemal Balkan were continued in 1972. ACEMHi YiYK. Professor Nimet Ozguii kindly re- ports the following progress during 1972. The ex- cavations concentrated in two areas: Hatipler Te- pesi and a new trench near the w edge of the mound. Hatipler Tepesi: In 1971, a trench had been opened in this high area c. 150-175 m. to the Nw of the palace. Storerooms of a large burnt building were exposed, cf. AJA 76 (1972) I70. The trench was enlarged in all directions in 1972 to investigate this burnt complex which in building technique and orientation is remarkably like the palace. At the N side the limits of the building are lost by ero- sion at the edge of the mound, otherwise it is con- tinuing in the direction of the palace. The storage rooms cleared are interconnected in two parallel rows. One room contained a large number of round- necked pitchers with small lids; in the same room bullae belonging with the pitchers were found. These bullae are partly identical with those found in the palace. Among the designs are gods on ani- mals, seated deities, double-headed eagle with an- telopes, signe royal with guilloches and various or- namental bands, also impressions of a small seal parallels of which are known from Kiiltepe, Alisar, Karahiiyiik-Konya and Gordion. Five rooms had pithoi in dense rows embedded in the floors, this in contrast to the palace where only one pithos-room is known. In the s part of the building, a room with some storage vessels also had a neatly profiled rectangular marble base, damaged by conflagra- tion, perhaps an altar? The general nature of the newly discovered building seems to be that of an official large storage complex, solidly built and provided with an upper story. The new trench near the Nw edge of the mound was taken down through five habitation levels, all of the Colony period. From the first level came a group of lead figurines (two male, one female); also two clay cups of thin burnished ware with in- cised ornament, somewhat metallic in appearance. The second level had kantharos fragments; beaked pitchers continue in lower levels. Fine pieces of bone inlay, bone points and bone handle orna- ments were also found; in general this area prom- ises to be rich in small objects. ULUKI?LA-PORSUK. A preliminary report on the first season appeared in Syria 47 (1970) 279-286. A report on the 1971 and 1972 campaigns is to be pub- lished in Syria 49 (1972) 303-317. In 1972, Professor Pelon kindly reports, there were no new excava- tions but the staff spent three weeks studying the pottery and other material from previous seasons. MEYDANCIK KALESI. This site in Cilicia Tra- cheia is being excavated by a joint French-Turkish expedition under the direction of Professor E. Laroche and Director Raci Temizer, cf. AJA 76 (1972) 171. In 1972, Professor Laroche kindly reports, trenches were opened in the Hittite bastion to the N and in the area of the large "Graeco-</page><page sequence="6">174 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 77 Persian" building to the s. The N trench, as re- ported by the excavator J. C. Courtois, "yielded a Byzantine and a Hellenistic occupation level. The Byzantine level had stone pavements, channels, a rectangular basin, and small stone walls forming rectangular units. Among the finds were iron and bronze knives, arrowheads, bracelets, a bronze coin of Basil II (Ioth century A.D.), much pottery, glazed bowls and plates, a terracotta plaque with a relief of Virgin and Child. At the base of the orthostat walls in area VI a thick Hellenistic level was found, with 4th-3rd century pottery, similar to wares known from Tarsus and Salamis (Cyprus). A nearly sterile stratum below this did contain an Ionic black-glazed bowl of c. 500 B.c. On one of the foundation blocks of the E face of the bastion, 13 m. N of the monumental entrance, we found a long Aramaic inscription. Although partly erased, this inscription confirms the importance of Achae- menian rule in Cilicia Tracheia." The impressive masonry of the entrance walls will be illustrated in the next installment of Anatolian news. KARAHiUYUK-KONYA. Professor Sedat Alp kindly reports that the sounding in the highest part of the mound was continued down to Early Bronze Age level 13. The pottery sequence continues to show regional traits in spite of affinities to West Anatolia and Cilicia. On the s side of the mound, where vil- lagers had destroyed part of the accumulations, a clearing operation yielded material of level 6, the end of the Early Bronze Age. The pottery of this phase is handmade but some wheelmade items also occur, e.g. buff two-handled goblets related to the depas sequence, and a zoomorphic vessel with bar- rel-shaped body. The stratigraphic sounding will continue in 1973. ILGIN. The site of the basin with the long Hittite Hieroglyphic inscription of Tuthaliya IV was in- vestigated again early in the summer of 1972, as Director Raci Temizer kindly reports, cf. AJA 76 (1972) I7i. Soundings near the basin yielded late classical material, as did the site on the hilltop nearby. The basin will remain covered until fur- ther excavations can be undertaken. KARATA?-SEMAYUiK. The 1971 campaign was re- ported upon AJA 76 (1972) 257-269. In 1972, the SE area of the mound yielded evidence for em- bankments and bastions of level IV and a palisade of level I, the latter c. 60 m. in diameter. A wattle- and-daub house was built against this enclosure. Analysis of the building techniques continued. The plan of the house of level I was clarified. A report will appear in AJA. ANTALYA. The new district museum in Antalya, opened in November 1972, contains prehistoric gal- leries with exhibits from the Karain and Karatas excavations supplemented by material purchased in the area. Early Bronze Age pottery predominates; Early Bronze III and Middle Bronze Age finds are scarce. Much of the purchased pottery comes from the Burdur area, where cemeteries have been looted; the largest holdings of Pisidian Early Bronze Age finds (pottery, metal, clay objects) are in the Burdur Museum. APHRODISIAS. In 1972, Professor Kenan Erim kindly reports, work continued on the w slope of the acropolis mound. "The main purpose was to consolidate the Late Bronze sequences found in 1971. In trench 8, a structure of three mudbrick walls was oriented NE- sw. Its central room had a hearth. Pottery frag- ments and artifacts point to a Late Bronze date but some Middle Bronze material suggests a fairly continuous occupation. In trench 9, mudbrick walls on stone foundations were surrounded by post- holes. The area had hearths, refuse pits, ash de- posits; it should be dated to a period between the Late Bronze and the early Iron Ages. The pottery includes more painted ware fragments than the Late Bronze material from trench 8." For illustrations of some of the prehistoric ma- terial from Aphrodisias cf. TiirkArkDerg I9:I (1970) pp. 83-85- IAsos. For the Early Bronze Age levels of lasos see under Mycenaean sites. IZMIR-KijijK YAMANLAR. Dr. Musa Baran of the Izmir Museum kindly reports that in December 1971 a sounding was made by the staff of the Izmir Museum in a small mound near the water reservoir which was being constructed. The area had previ- ously (in 1935) been disturbed, but prehistoric strata were in evidence. At i m. depth a general burnt layer appeared. Among the pottery from the mound was a dark buff burnished, incised jar set on two stump feet. The body has two handles with knobs (pl. 31, fig. 5, ht. o.2o m., max. diam. o.19 m.). There also were disturbed prehistoric burials. TROY. W. Schirmer reconsidered the question whether the plans of Troy I and Troy II can be correctly restored on the basis of the Schliemann and Blegen excavations, IstMitt 21 (1971) I-43.</page><page sequence="7">1973] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 175 In AA i971, 419-422 H. P. Schifer draws atten- tion to a trinket mold from Schliemann's excava- tions which he plausibly attributes to Troy II. WEST ANATOLIAN JEWELRY. Refik Duru, in Bel- leten 142 (1972) 123-135 discusses the Anatolian occurrence of gold earplugs known e.g. from third millennium burials in the region of Sardis, Yortan, Karayavsan, Elmall. PONTIC SITES. Professor U. Bahadir Alkim kindly reports that he continued his explorations of the Samsun-Bafra area in the summer of 1972. A large number of mounds was recorded, many newly dis- covered, and several sites were more closely ex- amined. Much pottery of the Middle Bronze Age and Old Hittite type was encountered; Early Bronze Age habitation is also in evidence. There are indications of wattle-and-daub architecture as is to be expected in this forested zone of North Anatolia. Explorations will continue in 1973. HEMITE-HAMIDE. The Hittite rock relief on the Ceyhan river s of Karatepe was studied anew by Alfonso Archi in SMEA 14 (I971) 71-74. TILMEN HiUYUiK. A report on the 1970 campaign appeared in TiirkArkDerg 19:2 (1970) 39-50, with illustrations of the inner and outer fortification systems, cf. AnatSt 21 (1972) 23-24, and for 1971, TTKR 1971, 30-34. Professor U. Bahadir Alkim kindly reports the following on the most recent work at Tilmen Hiiyiik, where excavations were brought to a close at the end of the 1972 season. The mound has a double fortification system built of basalt and mudbrick: the outer casemate wall, which is 820 m. long, and the inner (citadel) wall, also of casemate construction, with bastions at the corners and a stepped gateway approach at the E side. The compartments in both casemate walls have doorways either communicating with the next unit or giving access to and from the cita- del; some units are filled with rubble, e.g. unit C8 of the outer wall which is next to a staircase-room. Under the floors of the compartments, contracted burials have been found. These have tomb gifts of the Middle Bronze and Late Bronze I periods. The fortification systems, like the buildings in the citadel, were used in two periods: the begin- ning of the second millennium B.c. and the first part of the Late Bronze Age. The architectural results of the excavations at Tilmen will add great- ly to our knowledge of second millennium citadels in SE Anatolia and supplement the date from Aga- na-Alalah. GAZIANTEP REGION. A topographical study of the region of Gaziantep was published by Alfonso Archi, Paolo E. Pecorella and Mirjo Salvini, Gazi- antep e la sua regione (Incunabula Graeca 48, 1971). The mounds (a total of 216) of the area were vis- ited and are listed here with brief descriptions. The purpose of the enterprise is to contribute to the topographical recording of Anatolian sites, in the tradition of Professor Meriggi's journeys. The emi- nently historical area of Gaziantep contains a pro- lific amount of stratified evidence. Maps, photo- graphs and comments accompany the listing. MALATYA-ARSLANTEPE. A report on the 1969 and 1970 seasons by Alba Palmieri appeared in Tiirk- ArkDerg 19:2 (1970) 203-2II. A gate of Alisar ioT type has been excavated on the N side of the mound, with towers containing double compart- ments. This gate is of the Middle Bronze Age, level Vb. It stands on an artificial embankment. In a later stage, domestic units were installed in the gate area which was subsequently burnt. Level VI is late third millennium; the painted ware of this level has also been found in earlier soundings at Arslantepe, although it is now better known from the newly excavated Keban area sites. Houses in level VII have fragments of wall painting (red and black geometric patterns on white); this level is equated with Amuq F which would make it Late Chalcolithic; a gap is assumed between VI and VII. Level VII is also characterized by intra- mural burials. Contracted inhumations are found under house floors. Among the tomb gifts are pot- tery and beads; a marble lion pendant is of fine, stylized form. Anthropological material from Malatya was dis- cussed by Seniha Tunakan in Antropoloji 5 (1969- 70) 1-7. KEBAN. The second and third general volumes on the program of rescue excavations have now ap- peared: Keban Project 1969 Activities (Ankara 1971) and Keban Project 1970 Activities (Ankara 1972), volumes 2 and 3 in series I of the Middle East Technical University Keban Project Publica- tions. The volumes contain reports and ample il- lustrations including aerial photographs of indi- vidual sites, also details on geophysical surveys (results of resistivity measurements), and some studies of modern village architecture. The reports will be quoted here as Keban Reports 1969 and 1970, respectively. PULUR. Dr. Himit Kosay's reports in Keban Re-</page><page sequence="8">176 MACHTELD J.

Keban Reports 1968, site N53/3), a small mound set on a natural rocky base, was investigated by a team under Dr. Hayri Ertem of Ankara University. Reports on the 1970 season appeared in TiirkArkDerg 19:1 (1970) 87-92 and Keban Reports 197o, 63-74. The upper levels are Byzantine, and levels IV-X yielded Early Bronze levels with hearths of Early Bronze II type. Among the pottery was a pithos sherd with cylinder seal impression (level VIII). TEPECIK. For reports of previous seasons cf. Ke- ban Reports 1969, 107-129; Keban Reports 1970, 137-158. Tepecik is a prehistoric mound with habi- tation continuing in the second millennium (as at- tested by levels with Hittite pottery and Mitannian as well as Hittite seals) and into the Iron Age. In 1971, Dr. Ufuk Esin kindly reports, "one of our aims was to find out how far habitation of the vari- ous periods had extended into the fields surround- ing the mound. To the N of the mound, walls of the Old Hittite period were found in one trench; elsewhere, Chalcolithic and, under a sterile layer, late Neolithic sherds came to light. In a trench to the w, a large building was found containing late Uruk material, e.g. beveled rim bowls. The Hittite Empire level was reached on the E terrace of the mound; a badly burnt house here contained pithoi and jars. "On the mound proper, we investigated Early Bronze III building periods. In the third phase, mudbrick houses stood on either side of a N-s street; among the inventory were Khirbet Kerak pottery, some imported Akkadian ware, some plain and painted wares. The fourth sub-level had burnt mudbrick houses, very well preserved, facing on a SW-NE road. One of these houses probably had a second storey. The storage jars were neatly aligned: pithoi near the N wall of a house, large jars in the middle, small pots and potstands near the hearth. "In the Early Bronze II level, stone terracing walls existed on the sw slope of the mound, support- ing mudbrick houses. Here much imported North Syrian and Mesopotamian pottery was found as- sociated with Khirbet Kerak ware. In the N and w sector of the mound the second millennium B.C. levels have been clarified; the third Middle Bronze level had a three-room house with remnants of red stucco paint." Plate 31, fig. 2 shows an airview of Tepecik. North is to the lower left, the central trenches are down to Early Bronze III levels; second millen- nium levels appear near the N side. KORUCUTEPE. For previous campaigns, cf. Keban Reports 1969, 47-69; Keban Reports 197o, 83-85; AnatSt 21 (1971) 17-19; TiirkArkDerg 19:1 (1970) 127-132. There has been no excavation after 1970. NOR?UNTEPE. Previous campaigns were reported upon in Keban Reports 1969, 71-90; Keban Reports 1970, 103-117; AnatSt 21 (1971) 19-21; AJA 76 (1972) I75- Dr. Harald Hauptmann kindly reports the fol- lowing results of the fourth and fifth campaigns (1971 and 1972): "Hittite houses (level III) were excavated on the sw part of the citadel; two complexes separated by a narrow alley. The N house measures 15 x 10 m. and has four rooms. In the s house, near a hearth, lay a charred wooden box, a wooden comb, frit and limestone beads, bronze pins. In the next lower level were foundations of a similar house; from below these, in the Old Hittite level, came a red polished rhyton fragment in the shape of a bull's head (pl. 31, fig. 4). "In the N part of the s terrace, Old Hittite levels were also reached. Stone foundations of a compart- mented wall (4 x 5 m. units) may belong to an Old Hittite fortification, cf. Korucutepe. One of two adjoining rooms had a figure-8 shaped hearth of citadel level IV-V type. "Early Bronze III citadel (level VI): the palatial complex of this level is now largely cleared. It cov- ers 2700 m2 and consists of several units. To the NE lies the pithos-building (25 x 15 m.) with eight rooms, four in the rear with pithoi, four in front with profiled hearths. West of this, lies the w magazine (22 x 8 m.), separated by a 4 m. wide passage from a terrace measuring 21 x 14 m. In this terrace a 15 x 7 m. storeroom is set against the E wall. The outer wall of the terrace is 2.50 m. thick. To the w of the terrace, on the slope, is a large house with central hearth. East of this, overlaid</page><page sequence="9">1973] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 177 by a storeroom to the sw of the pithos building, is another regular building complex of eight rooms, measuring i6 x 12 m. Doors connect the rooms, which also have E doorways and are equipped with benches, platforms, and horseshoe-shaped hearths. "Among the small finds are terracotta brush- handles. Black polished and painted East Anatolian Early Bronze III pottery is plentiful. "Level VII was excavated in the w area (pl. 31, fig. i); a 7 x 7 m. room has ten pithoi; three ad- joining rooms have benches and hearths. Across a 2 m. wide alley stood a predecessor of the pithos building of level VI, set farther to the s but similar in plan and detail. South of this were two large rooms with ovens; the rooms are subdivided and the domed ovens stand on raised pavements of mudbrick. "In level VIII, another eight-room pithos build- ing was excavated. This building was badly burnt; two rooms to the sw measure 6 x 5 m. and have round hearths; the next room, 8 x 4 m., has twenty pithoi, also many black polished and painted ves- sels of an early Early Bronze III phase. Houses of level VIII were cleared on the w slope; from here a 2 m. wide street leads w-E to the interior of the citadel; narrower alleys branch off to the N and s and form insulae. To the N of the street were houses with various hearth-types; one had a triple horse- shoe-shaped hearth. To the s, one complex of six rooms measures 13 x Ii m.; it has a small central room and around it kitchen, storeroom and living rooms; in the NE corner perhaps a cult room, with red plaster and a large triple horseshoe-shaped hearth. Small finds are pottery, animal figurines, whorls, bronze and bone pins. "The transition from Early Bronze III to MB was examined in a sounding on the w slope. The ceramic sequence is clear; more work will be done in these transitional levels. "A deep sounding in the w slope took place in 1971-72. Late Chalcolithic levels 1-4 have rooms with fixed hearths. To level 4 belongs a mudbrick fortifi- cation wall. The handmade chaff-faced ware and the painted ware with cross-hatched triangles (pl. 31, fig. 3, purple-brown on light) are related to Amuq F. Levels 3-4 also have fine light or green- ish wares, with Ubaid affinities in motifs and shapes (Amuq E-F). There is a good amount of flint and obsidian blades, and obsidian arrowheads (pl. 31, fig. 6); also of bronze, and stone celts. Charred grain and seeds were plentiful. Level 5 had two rooms in a sounding which measured 10 x 20 m., one with a hearth in the center. Pot- tery and architecture show a break in tradition. Level 7 produced three rooms with central round hearths, a narrow street, and more rooms to the s, one with two niches in its N wall. To level 8 be- longs a house with two niches in its E wall; the I m. wide space between the niches, on its fourth coat of plaster, had a poorly preserved painting of an animal facing right. The contours are black, the interior red, the naturalistic traits are remotely reminiscent of atal Hiiytik. The pottery is chaff- faced ware; also fine grey, green and yellow wares, the latter with characteristic carinated vessels. Dec- oration is in paint or by incision and stamp pat- terns (cf. Tepe Gawra XI-IX, late Uruk). One simple stamp seal has antithetical animals; a stamped bulla shows an ibex design." MYCENAEAN AND MINOAN SITES MILETUS. A report on the 1970 campaign ap- peared in TiirkArkDerg 19:1 (1970) 122-125. Professor G. Kleiner reports that in 1972 no excavations took place in the deeper levels. For the later periods, see below under classical sites. IAsos. The campaigns of 1969-70 are discussed in detail by Professor Doro Levi in ASAtene N.S. 31-32 (1969-I970) 461-532. This report makes the extent of the Mycenaean occupation of Iasos im- pressively clear. It has illustrations of Mycenaean walls and Mycenaean IIIA-IIIC pottery, as well as of earlier material of Middle Minoan III-Late Mi- noan I date. Dr. Clelia Laviosa kindly reports the following results of the 1971 campaign: "In the area of the Imperial Agora, the sounding near the West stylobate was enlarged toward the center and deepened to prehistoric levels. East of the protogeometric necropolis and the underlying Middle and Late Bronze walls, we have cleared part of a large rectangular building with a door in its N side (pl. 32, fig. 8). This door opens to a cobbled street; along the N side of the building runs a walkway of a double row of stone slabs. The outer walls of the building are made of large stones set with their better worked sides to the exterior, smaller stones fill the interstices along the inner face. Partition walls divide the building into rectan- gular units, stone-paved. There are several phases; the lower level (pavement at -2.75 m.) has Mid- dle Bronze pottery, among which are Middle Mi-</page><page sequence="10">178 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 77 noan imports and imitations; also local Middle Bronze ware comparable to pottery from Aphro- disias and Elmali. The next level (-2.45 m.) has imported pottery of the second Minoan palace pe- riod and local imitations; the upper (-2.05 m.), Late Helladic III ware and imitations. "In the sanctuary of Artemis Astias, deep sound- ings in the E area went through Hellenistic, classi- cal and geometric levels down to a wall of the Mycenaean period associated with abundant Myce- naean pottery; below this (at -3.00 m.) were three Early Bronze Age cist-graves, each containing a vase (pl. 32, fig. 9). "More prehistoric material was found in the area of the Basilica near the East Gate, where one level also belongs to the Early Bronze Age. In the My- cenaean level here a wall corner came to light with a platform against its s side." For Iron Age lasos, cf. below under classical sites. BAYRAKLI-OLD SMYRNA. Professor Ekrem Akur- gal kindly confirms that some extrusive Mycenaean sherds have turned up in peripheral areas of the mound; so far no attempt has been made to ex- cavate Late Bronze Age habitation levels. URARTIAN AND EAST ANATOLIAN IRON AGE SITES 9AVU?TEPE. For a report on the 1970 campaign, cf. TiirkArkDerg 19:2 (1970) 103-lo8 and Belleten 138 (1971) 334-340. Professor Afif Erzen continued his excavations in 1971 and 1972, cf. TTKR 1971, 36-42. The areas of concentration continue to be: I. The entrance fortress (U? kale). Here clear- ance of the s fortification walls is still in progress, starting from the stepped area cleared in 1965-66. 2. In the temple area, more rooms s of the N cor- ridor were excavated. The mudbrick walls are thick and preserved to over 3 m. in height. The rooms contain debris of a conflagration which ruined the building; there was a reoccupation after the debris had been leveled. The fortifications N of the temple have bastions projecting at 7.40 m. intervals; these bastions are about 4 m. wide and project I m. 3. In the palace area, the N fortifications are now being cleared; their bastions come at 6.40-6.90 m. intervals. From burnt debris near one of the bas- tions came fragments of wall painting, iron and bronze spear points and arrowheads, a bone amulet with inscription in cuneiform Urartian. Other small finds come from the debris of the palace. In the burnt destruction levels lay three skeletons, one with a bronze fibula on the shoulder. ADILCEVAZ. Professors Emin Bilgig and Baki iiin kindly report that excavations in 1972 con- tinued both in the citadel and in the necropolis area. In the citadel, clearance of the fortification walls proceeds gradually. At the E and w ends of the citadel, houses built of fieldstones and con- taining plain wheelmade pottery and storage jars probably are evidence of Armenian reoccupation of the site, not as yet precisely datable. The Urar- tian levels of the citadel yield very little in the category of small finds, although large storage jars are found in quantity. The Urartian necropolis (cf. AJA 76 [1972] 176- 177) will supply the small finds which are lacking at the main site. More tombs were excavated in 1972, both cremations and inhumations in small rock-cut chambers, irregular in plan. Among the tomb gifts are a large bronze belt, bronze fibulae, iron knives, pottery (red polished bowls and pitch- ers). Professor Baki Oiiin will discuss the Urartian cemetery of Adilcevaz at the Archaeological Con- gress in Ankara, 1973. VAN. The University of Istanbul, in cooperation with the German Archaeological Institute and the Geodetic Institute of Karlsruhe, undertook a photogrammetric recording of the rock of Van under the direction of Professor R. Naumann. This record will serve as a basis for a study of the Urartian and later constructions on the citadel. NOR?UNTEPE. Dr. Harald Hauptmann kindly re- ported the following Iron Age developments in the 1971-72 seasons (for earlier periods, cf. above under Bronze Age sites): "Citadel. A late cemetery had intruded into the upper building levels Ia and b. A 7th-6th century B.c. building here consists of three separate rooms, each with four interior supports, and an entrance unit. A torus-shaped base with square plinth came from the central room of level Ia, cf. bases from Khorsabad, Zincirli, Agana. The building belongs to the Urartian period. Level II has pits with Early Iron Age pottery, much of it with horizontal grooves. To the s of the building, a large pit of 16 x 15 m. had cut through all Iron Age levels; it was found filled in with layers of dirt and three intermediate strata of reeds. In the SE part, a cham- ber of 6 x 7 m. was built of mudbrick on a stone foundation of several courses (1.40-2.00 m. wide).</page><page sequence="11">1973] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 179 At foundation level over 50 rectangular iron scales of armour were found; in the fill were fragments of an iron axe and knife. The pit was over 8 m. deep; sherds from the fill dated to the 7th-6th cen- turies B.c. The tomb chamber resembles a chamber with horse burials found in 1970. "In the s part of the terrace, the s side of the 7th- 6th century Urartian building is 42 m. long and has the same buttresses as the w and N sides. The foun- dations of the building were partly re-used in a later phase. The plan of this building reflects an Urartian type known from Karmir Blur, Bastam and Argishtihinili. Another building was found in 1972 to the Nw, again with buttresses along the exterior walls. A contemporary pithos burial in the fields nearby contained a child burial with a bronze omphalos bowl and bracelet. "In the N part of the terrace, a 20 x 20 m. farm- house was excavated. It has oval silos, rectangular hearths, horseshoe-shaped ovens or cooking pits. The pottery is horizontally grooved or red painted, C. 800 B.C." NEO-HITTITE AND PHRYGIAN SITES KiiLTEPE. Professor Tahsin Ozgii? kindly reports that overlying the Middle Bronze Age palace in the center of the mound, two stages of Iron Age habitation can be recognized, with pottery of "Phrygian" type. Above these lay Hellenistic and Roman levels. SULTANHAN. Dr. Kutlu Emre again conducted excavations on this mound c. 45 km. NE Of Kayseri, cf. AJA 76 (1972) I77. She kindly reports that the mound, damaged during the construction of the nearby railroad, has deposits of about 4 m. depth. There are three Hellenistic-Roman levels which in turn damaged the underlying neo-Hittite re- mains. One room of the "Phrygian" period was cleared. The pottery of this level is plentiful and is mostly of buff monochrome type. There is some painted ware of Phrygian affinities, e.g. kraters with geometric motifs (triangles, wavy lines, bands, dots but none of the Aligar variety). Among the inventory are plain buff kraters with ledge-rims, red polished trefoil cups with white ground panels, large trefoil jugs, and a few black polished pieces. Below the Iron Age levels, Early Bronze Age de- posits appear. There are very few sherds of the second millennium B.C. NI6DE-TEPEBABLARI. A new excavation was started in I972 by Professor Nimet Ozgiip and the staff of the Ni'de Museum on behalf of the Turkish His- torical Society and the General Directorate of Mu- seums. The site is a high, compact mound in the vineyards c. 4 km. sw of Nigde. The project aims at an investigation of the neo-Hittite (Tabal) levels which evidently are strongly represented here. Surface samplings yield good painted pot- tery of Phrygian affinities, some with geometric designs or with deer, rays and concentric circles. The mound also has thick prehistoric levels, to judge by pottery, obsidian implements and a stone bowl fragment. The excavation in 1972 started in the highest part of the mound and so far has reached two levels. The upper has Byzantine architectural re- mains with iron tools, iron pots and pans, glazed pottery, and coins which date to the seventh cen- tury A.D. The second level is Hellenistic. Two rooms with stone foundations evidently belong to a larger building. Much Hellenistic pottery of excellent quality and regional origin was collected (similar fabrics were found at nearby Porsuk). Also remarkable are glass finds, e.g. blue glass finely decorated bracelets and a lobed phiale. PORSUK-ULUKI?LA. For this site cf. above under Bronze Age sites. A pithos found in 1971 at Porsuk (pl. 35, fig. 27) has a parallel in the Nigde Mu- seum. KARATEPE. F. Steinherr in Die Welt des Orients 6 (I971) 166-182 analyzes chronological and palaeo- graphic problems of the Karatepe inscriptions. A new installment of the Karatepe bilinguals is be- ing readied for publication. AMUQ. The Iron Age architecture of the sites excavated by the Oriental Institute in 1933-1938 is now published in Excavations in the Plain of Antioch II, by Richard C. Haines (OIP 95, Chi- cago 197i). The sites are Qatal Hiiyiik, Tell al- Judaidah and Tell Tainat; the neo-Hittite build- ings of the latter site in particular (hilani and "megaron") are now described in stratigraphic sequence. YENIDOAN. A new Phrygian excavation has been started by Director Burhan Tezcan on behalf of the General Directorate of Antiquities and Mu- seums. The site is a large mound c. 15 km. NE Of Polatli, N of the main road from Polathl to Ankara, near the village and railroad station of Yenidoan. Mr. Tezcan kindly reports that a long-range project is envisaged. The site is a mound of c. 6oo00 m. in diameter, larger than Gordion, and without Ro-</page><page sequence="12">180 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 77 man or Hellenistic overlay so far as has been es- tablished. The first aim is the investigation of the fortification system and the roads leading into the citadel. In 1972, monumental mudbrick walls came to light, outer defenses with cross-walls going into the citadel evidently as interior divisions. Bastions of 7 m. width project 3 m. from the main wall. On the outside, terracing of the kind known from the Gordion mound can be observed: rubble fills were put in and held in place by retaining walls to enlarge and raise the citadel area. The mound so far is nameless, but it evidently contains an important Phrygian citadel c. 2o km. as the crow flies from Gordion. About five tumuli lie in the vicinity. PHRYGIAN EPIGRAPHY. For progress notes on the corpus of Phrygian inscriptions, cf. AnatSt 21 (1971) 24-25 and SMEA io (1969) 19-47. DiUVER. W. Willson Cummer has now published his study of the architectural terracottas from the looted site of Diiver, 10 km. w of Hacilar, on the basis of the pieces preserved in the Burdur Mu- seum, Anadolu 14 (1970) 29-54. LYCIAN, CARIAN, LYDIAN, GREEK, HELLENISTIC, ROMAN SITES PERGE. Professor Arif Miifid Mansel published reports on the 1970 season in TiirkArkDerg 19:2 (I970) 169-I84 and AnatSt 21 (I97I) 35-36. For the 1971 season, he kindly reports the following: "The Agora area is now cleared completely on the E side, partly on the other sides. The plan is nearly square, 76 x 74.35 m. on the exterior, 52 x 51 m. measured from the interior corners of the stoa stylobates. The granite columns stood on pedestals, the entablature has a wide architrave, a low profiled frieze with floral decoration, and a cornice with lion-head spouts; the total height of the order is 7.80 m. The entrances to the Agora are set on the main axes; the entrance rooms were partly blocked in the Byzantine period. In the center is a round building of 13 m. in diameter. A bronze statue of Attis, c. I m. high, was found near the E side of the Agora. In front of one of the shops on the N side was a marble gaming board with stone benches. "The Nymphaeum at the foot of the acropolis, near the end of the colonnaded street, has a U- shaped plan, 21 m. wide with wings 8.75 m. long. The fountain proper is in the center. The fagade has three vaulted niches (pl. 32, fig. ii); in front of the central one is a statue of a reclining river god on a pedestal and a basin of 6 x 3-55 m. To the left and right of the fountain are barrel-vaulted doorways; the wings project to the rear. Many fragments were found of the architectural decora- tion of the facade and wings, e.g. of a frieze with thyrsoi and grapes (pl. 33, fig. 12), and of the cornice decorated with theater masks (pl. 33, fig. I3), satyr and Maenad heads. In front of the basin several statues were found in good condition, life- size and with heads preserved: a Zeus, an Artemis, a cuirass statue of Hadrian, a heroic nude Hadrian, and a young male (Apollo?) found near the w wing. The nymphaeum also had a rear facade, partly cleared in 1972 and found as rich as the front of the building." The statues from Perge now have been put on impressive display in the sculpture galleries of the new museum at Antalya. SIDE. A brief report on the harbor explorations undertaken in 1970 is given by J6rg Schiifer in AnatSt 21 (i97i) 34, cf. also an article by the late Helmut Schliger about the harbor of Side in BonnJbb 171 (I971) I50-I6I. ANAMUR. Professor J. Russell kindly reports the following on the 1972 season of the Canadian ex- cavations at Anemurium (cf. AnatSt 21 [1971] 13- 14 and AJA 76 [1972] 178-179): "The principal features of the palaestra being now well established (cf. pl. 36, fig. 30), some de- tails still needed investigation. The s wing of the suite of three halls at the w end of the complex was left unfinished. The complete excavation of the cistern (8 m. deep) cut through the floor of the limestone paved court produced homogeneous ma- terial belonging to the sixth and first half of the seventh centuries A.D. Further probing of the pack- ing beneath the mortar base of the mosaic pave- ment of the palaestra has corroborated the terminus post quem for its construction about the mid-third century A.D. The extension of trenches at the NE corner of the palaestra produced the unexpected appearance of two chambers each paved with mo- saic of polychrome geometric design closely re- sembling the fine mosaic of the palaestra with traces of marble revetment still visible along the wall-bases. The location of these rooms at a lower level than the palaestra and the absence of any doorway providing access to it suggests that they are part of an entirely new complex opening to the N and w.</page><page sequence="13">1973] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 181 "Excavation of the adjacent baths began with the hall in the NE corner of the complex. From limited sondages it was possible to establish a plan con- sisting of a rectangular piscina (10.35 x 7.85 m.) with a depth of i.40 m. entered at each corner by narrow steps from the surrounding walk, and at the s end an area paved in mosaic of polychrome geometric design. "Investigations of the exedra building con- structed against the large terrace wall that separates it from the palaestra have revealed that the water systems entering the back wall of the apse are a later modification; this discovery led to the aban- donment of the previous identification of the build- ing as a nymphaeum. The facade of the exedra was adorned by marble revetment fastened by bronze pegs to the wall, some of them still in situ along with their marble. Large quantities of late pottery continue to appear in the fill overlying the Roman floors, African and Cypriot Red Slip and Late Roman C being the commonest of the fine wares. In all, 132 coins were found, falling into two large groups, c. A.D. 350-400 and c. 600-660. A third group consists of six third century coins minted at Ane- murium." A volume on the tombs has been published by Elisabeth Alf6ldi-Rosenbaum, The Necropolis of Anamur (Ankara 1971, Turkish Historical So- ciety). CREMNA. Professor Jale Inan published an ex- tensive report of her 197o excavations at Cremna in Pisidia, TiirkArkDerg 19:2 (1970) 51-97; cf. AJA 76 (1972) 179 and AnatSt 21 (I97i) 46-47. The site of Cremna had recently been subject to plundering and some statuary had been sold to the Burdur museum. Professor Inan investigated the building marked Q on Lanckoronski's plan Stddte Pamphyliens und Pisidiens II (Vienna 1892) 161-172. The building was cleared to a large extent and a new plan and sections were made. The iden- tification as a library is convincingly argued by the excavator. Inscribed statue-bases stood in front of interior spur-walls. Several bases were found in situ although the statues had been removed by the villagers (base II, Herakles; V, Athena, VII, Apol- lo; the other inscriptions do not match the statues allegedly found by the looters). The statues now in the Burdur Museum are published in the re- port. They are of fine-grained white marble, in good condition but for missing heads and limbs: Tyche, two Athenas, Asklepios, Leto, Aphrodite, Hygieia, a draped female, Apollo, Herakles. The inscriptions are discussed by G. E. Bean in Tiirk- ArkDerg I19:2 (I970) 99-102. SAGALASSOS. Dr. Robert Fleischer of the Austrian Archaeological Institute kindly reports the follow- ing: "A brief investigation was made of the four reliefs published by K. Lanckoronski, Stadte Pam- phyliens und Pisidiens II (1892) 139, figs. o109-110o. These reliefs lay in a pile of debris NE of the temple labeled R. Three new reliefs were found, making a total of seven slabs with a combined length of 9 m. They belong to a frieze of young women dancing and making music (pl. 34, figs. 19 and 22). The figures are connected by long sweeping dra- pery. Figure 19 is a corner of the frieze. The style is good Hellenistic; the frieze is not to be con- nected with the inscription quoted by Lanckoron- ski p. 140. In 1973 more investigations will take place and the carved slabs will be taken to the Burdur Museum." SELGE. For architectural and epigraphical work done at Selge in 1968, cf. JOAI 49 (1968-69) Grab- ungen 19-23. ANTALYA. The report of the restoration of the gate of Hadrian, which took place in 1958, is pub- lished by Mahmut Akok in TiirkArkDerg 19:I (1970) 37-53- ELMALI. The conservation of the two painted tombs in the vicinity of Elmall continued in the framework of the Bryn Mawr College expedition in 1972. The interior of the archaic tomb at Kizilbel was carefully treated and the damaged joints of the masonry protected. Some new observations were made concerning the decoration of the s and N walls. Little new work was done in the Graeco- Persian tomb at Karaburun, but the s wall with the frieze of the ekphora has been partially cleaned. A report will appear in AJA and Tiirl(ArkDerg. ARYCANDA. The conservation work undertaken by Dr. Cevdet Bayburtluoglu continued in 1972. He kindly reports that the retaining wall of the stadium was repaired and the stadium cleared to its N end. Some debris was removed from the thea- ter. The site is terraced on the w slope of a moun- tain overlooking the Arycandus valley. LIMYRA. For a note on the 1970 campaign cf. AnatSt 21 (I97i) 36. Dr. Jiirgen Borchhardt kindly writes the following on the work during the fourth campaign in 1972: "The investigation of the heroon at Limyra was concluded with the reconstruction of the cen-</page><page sequence="14">182 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 77 tral N akroterion in the museum at Antalya. Perseus, raising the Gorgoneion in his right hand, rushes off over the fallen body of Medusa. The lateral akroteria therefore must be interpreted as Medusa's sisters Stheno and Euryale. "Lycian studies at Limyra continue with the examination of the terraces on the rocky slope w of the Roman theater. Pottery and terracotta finds seem to confirm that these terraces were used in the cult of the twelve Lycian gods. "In the lower city, a tower-shaped ruin was partly cleared in 1971. When we found an Augus- tan marble relief, the thought occurred that the monument might be the cenotaph of Gaius Caesar who died at Limyra in A.D. 4. The building has a square base of 16.77 x 16.77 m.; the concrete core is preserved to 12.50 m. height. Quarriers and looters had removed most of the outer casing of limestone; only the lower courses, made of well-fitted and doweled ashlar are preserved, partly below ground- water level. A marble superstructure crowned the monument. Fragments of architectural ornament, also of statues and reliefs, came from the Byzan- tine levels. A head with wispy hairlocks seems to fit the hypothesis of a cenotaph for Caius Caesar; it is paralleled by the so-called Lucius Caesar head from the inscribed heroon of Lucius Caesar on Thasos. The monument at Limyra takes its place in a series of Hellenistic and Roman tower-shaped mausolea built in Syria, Tunisia, Spain and Gaul (St. Remy)." LYCIA.

Metzger kindly continues his an- nual account of the excavations with the following details of the 1972 season: "Three trenches were in action. In the Nymphae- umrn, a relatively low watertable allowed us to study the connection with the spring near the temples. With the aid of strong pumps, we reached a mass of bedrock with artificially cut w face and incor- porated in the building. Water sprang from a fault in the rock and ran over gravel, through a chan- nel and into a semicircular basin. The Nymphaeum apparently was an architectural framework around a water supply directly fed by the sacred spring. This is of importance for the interpretation of the building which is evidently of sacred character. We now also have a better idea of the relationship between the Nymphaeum, which is of imperial date, and building D which stood opposite it at the E side. The latter building is late Hellenistic, considerably earlier than the Nymphaeum. Along its s side we cleared the bases of a series of statues erected in honor of a governor of Lycia-Pamphylia and his family. "In the area of Temple A, the fallen blocks in and around the cella were recorded and lifted with the aid of a crane. A total of 682 blocks, averaging 1-3 tons in weight, were thus removed. The peri- style and cella were completely cleared. The in- terior paving of the temple had been lifted in the Early Christian period. The temple evidently had been demolished deliberately, not ruined by earth- quake as we had thought. Plunderers looking for lead and bronze in the clamp holes had overturned the orthostats and column bases. The interior or- der of the cella consisted of engaged Corinthian half-columns set on benches (pl. 35, fig. 26). Over a triple architrave ran a frieze with carved lotus and palmette ornament. These details confirm a date of the temple in the 2nd half of the 2nd century B.C. "In the NE corner of the N trench (cf. AJA 76 [1972] i8o), under debris full of Roman pottery, the foundations of a peribolos wall(?) came out; this may be Hellenistic. In the sw corner, the Ro- man portico with double colonnade continues to the w. Under this portico are remains of at least two Lycian levels, the second with a complex of heavy walls of large blocks and a solid rectangular platform of 14 x 2 m. (pl. 35, fig. 25). At the base of this lay a mass of animal bones and some pre- Hellenistic pottery (5th century Attic and mostly local wares). Perhaps an altar once stood on this platform and was razed by the construction of the Roman portico. Under one of the walls an older construction came to light, possibly also an altar. The wall faces are made of well-finished orthostats. The pottery of this level suggests a seventh cen- tury date. In the upper levels of the N trench we collected fragments of inscriptions, some of which belong to lists of victors in the stadium. The prove- nance of these and similar fragments found earlier</page><page sequence="15">1973] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 183 suggests that the stadium was located somewhere close to this area." XANTHOS. Fouilles de Xanthos IV, Henri Metz- ger, Les Ceramiques archaiques et classiques de l'Acropole lycienne (Paris 1972) has now appeared. This volume in clear organization and illustra- tion demonstrates that on the acropolis of Xanthos no Bronze Age material was found, and that the earliest datable pottery is of the late geometric period (Cycladic imports). Professor Metzger in- terprets the history of Xanthian relations with the aid of imported wares: a strong Rhodian contact in the seventh and sixth centuries, with Samos clearly in evidence, and Corinth rarely represented; Attic black-figure is a large group, red-figure is less numerous but important. The local wares of the Lycian potters or their Anatolian neighbors are represented in fragments only. We need good ceme- tery finds in order to establish the repertoire in detail. The book is a manual of Anatolian-Greek interrelations along the sw Anatolian coast. For the Byzantine church on the upper acropolis at Xanthos, see below under Byzantine sites. KAUNOS. The excavations at Kaunos continue annually under the direction of Professor Baki Oiin. A report on the 1968-70 campaigns appeared in TiirkArkDerg 19:1 (1970) 195-202; cf. AnatSt 21 (I97I) 52-53, AJA 76 (1972) I8o-I8i. Professor O~iin kindly reports the following for the 1971 season: "In the area of the stoa, general clearing took place. A new trench was opened on the E side of the harbor. On the w slope of the N tip of the small citadel, a terrace wall stands to over 3 m. in height. This is the retaining wall of a building, perhaps a temple, constructed in excellent technique probably of the 4th century B.c. On the lower slope of this site, the square foundation of a round building was found (pl. 35, fig. 24). The latter was of the Ionic order, as shown by a capital and other architectural fragments. The remains lay 30-40 cm. below the surface; at a depth of 1.50 m. the foundations still continue, but groundwater covers the building. The pottery in the fill is Hellenistic to late Roman; some red-figure and black-glazed ware was among the sherds. Some of the sculpture which decorated the building was also found: two statues of young women, and one of a mature woman, who in type and costume resembles Artemisia, although of lesser quality. A Herm was also found; unfor- tunately all this statuary is headless. "At the w spur of the small citadel, a sounding was made in the area where previously a deposit of lamps had been found. It turned out that this is a bothros with temple debris. It contained lamps of late 4th century and Hellenistic types, also a series of terracottas from late archaic to Hellenistic. "The restoration of the theater continues. In the cleaning of the Agora, fragments of one or two presumably Carian inscriptions were found." Dr. Paavo Roos, a member of the Kaunos expedi- tion, has published his research on the rock-tombs, "The Rock-tombs of Caunus, I," Studies in Medi- terranean Archaeology 34:1 (1972). KNIDos. Professor Iris C. Love kindly sends the following summary of the sixth season of excava- tions, cf. AJA 76 (I972) 393-405- "The contour survey was extended to include all sites currently being excavated. At the junction of the main E-w street and Stepped Street 7, a build- ing of ashlar masonry, extending over 6o m. was investigated. A series of ten doorways open into rooms which are subdivided by partition walls. A rock-cut cistern filled with a vast amount of ce- ramics, figurines, and other objects was found un- derlying several of the rooms. A rectangular marble building extending over 42 m. was located along the main E-W street to the N of the Corinthian tem- ple. A subterranean room of i i x 4 m. descends to a depth of 3.84 m.; its walls were decorated with fine painted stucco of flora and fauna. Several pillaged tombs of the early Roman period were recorded. Five intact rock-cut chamber tombs were excavated. Two contained secondary burials. In the sanctuary of Aphrodite Euploia, sE of the podium, over 300 terracotta figurines were recovered. A sec- tion of the flagstone paved road leading from the E into the temenos was cleared. The altar was par- tially restored. To the N of the monopteros a nat- ural cave with two galleries was investigated. It yielded much pottery, lamps, and a few fragments of sculpture, e.g. a Hekateion. On the w side of the lower terrace, the large Roman building was al- most completely uncovered. An unfinished archaic kore was found in this area. This fact coupled with the inscriptions of Knidian artists suggests that Knidos supported a school of sculptors. Also the archaic kore, early fibulae, late archaic terra- cottas and early sherds are clear evidence that a settlement of some means existed at Knidos dur- ing the archaic and classical periods. The rectangu-</page><page sequence="16">184 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 77 lar marble monumental altar, I 1.04 x 6.69 m. was cleared. It was approached from the w by a stair- case of at least four steps. Three more slabs of its figured frieze were recovered. Also discovered in the area of the altar were a fine classical marble head, terracotta figurines, and Hellenistic Knidian pottery." THEANGELA. A group of votive terracottas from Caria, probably from Theangela, is published by Mehmet Tunay in TiirkArkDerg i9:I (1970) 201- 212. These have been acquired by the Istanbul Museum. IAsos. For previous campaigns, cf. TiirkArkDerg 19:1 (1970) 143-156; TiirkArkDerg 19:2 (1970) 161-167; AnatSt 21 (1971) 38-40; AJA 75 (I971) 173-174. An extensive report appeared in ASAtene N.S. 31-32 (1969-70) 461-532. Dr. Clelia Laviosa kindly reports the following on the 1971 season (for Mycenaean and Middle Bronze lasos, see above under Mycenaean sites): "In the expanded Agora sounding, above the Bronze Age buildings, protogeometric tombs are rather more scarce than in the w area previously excavated. To an intermediate level belong three round structures with built stone rims of various diameters, and two terracotta sarcophagi of oval shape (pl. 32, fig. 8). Elsewhere in the Agora, ex- cavation of the Roman imperial level was expanded below Seljuk, Byzantine and late Roman construc- tions (small foundries and workshops). Along the E side of the Agora we cleared the whole series of rooms opposite the tripartite building, preserved to the level of the ceiling, and continued to the SE corner of the Agora. Near the corner is a monu- mental gateway with three arches (pl. 32, fig. io shows one of the doorways) which probably con- nected the Agora with a street coming from the E. On the s side, a long stretch of the rear wall was cleared along the line of the Bouleuterion N wall; here various earlier elements were found, e.g. parts of an archaic marble relief with a horsedrawn chariot, the charioteer urging on his team, with a small hare running under the chariot. Outside of the w boundary wall of the Agora, clearance showed that the wall here coincided with the circuit wall of the fourth century B.c., of which the sw corner tower was also exposed, measuring 7 x 7 m. and preserving its rusticated ashlar ma- sonry to considerable height. Nearby, the s wall has a monumental gateway with a tetrastyle propy- ion, probably part of Hadrianic remodelling of the Agora. Along the w side of the Bouleuterion a section of masonry was exposed. Near the sw cor- ner of this building is a door with two arches; all these doors and gates were blocked in later times when (perhaps after the Herulian destruction) the fortifications were repaired. Soundings along the E side of the Bouleuterion exposed part of a Hellenistic stoa which seems to continue the w stoa of the sanctuary of Artemis Astias. Below this are late fifth century rooms and a channel, and further down a maze of walls associated with fine pottery of the orientalizing and geometric pe- riods. "In the sanctuary of Artemis Astias the w stoa was further exposed; this had a rear wall of large blocks, covered with plaster, and remnants of a marble stylobate. Geometric levels were reached in a sounding here; at the E side, Mycenaean and Bronze Age material was found (see above). "Near the E gate basilica, where the Bronze Age was also reached, upper levels yielded archaic, clas- sical and Hellenistic remains. In the large imperial Roman complex on the s tip of the peninsula, part of the building with mosaics was cleared; the far room of the triclinium has walls painted with ma- sonry designs and a mosaic floor with central me- dallion, meander borders and a band with vine tendrils and kantharos. A dog mosaic in black and white is in a corridor near a vestibule." EUROMOS. Dr. Omit Serdaro'lu continued his work connected with the restoration of the temple at Euromos (Ayakl), cf. AJA 76 (1972) 182 and AnatSt 21 (1971) 47-48. Hellenistic inscriptions were found with important details for the history of Euromos. The archaic terracotta revetments, a total of about 370 pieces, are now in the Bodrum Museum. So far there are no traces of architectural foundations of the archaic period. Dr. Serdarolu kindly reports that he also worked at an archaic site, Haci Bayram Tepe near Yata'an. This site also has a series of terracotta revetments, some with partridge motifs, cf. a frag- ment from Miletus. TURGUT-LAGINA. Professor Yusuf Boysal did not excavate in this area in 1972. CARIA. In BonnJbb 171 (1971) 132-149 Hans Lauter publishes observations on Hellenistic archi- tecture in Caria (Alinda, Alabanda, Lagina, Strato- nikeia, Mylasa). DIDYMA. Dr. Klaus Tuchelt kindly reports the following on the 1972 campaign of the German</page><page sequence="17">1973] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 185 Archaeological Institute at Didyma. For 1970, cf. IstMitt 21 (i971) 45-I08. "In the w area the soundings undertaken in 1969 (cf. IstMitt 21 [1971] 45-o08) were expanded in width to the N, s and E. The directions of two streets were established: one N-s heading for the sacred way and the other E-w, heading for the tem- ple. The orientation of these streets and adjoining structures does not follow that of the temple (III). The foundations first thought to belong to a pre- Hellenistic stoa (AIA 74 [1970] 171) are part of a complex of Hellenistic houses. On both sides of the street, a dense pattern of Hellenistic-Roman build- ings emerged, and some archaic foundations. To the NE the street runs on bedrock closely under the surface. Pottery finds range from seventh century B.c. to late classical; bronze coins are numerous. Other small finds are a bronze bolster handle, a bronze lamp with four wick-holes (pl. 33, fig. 14, length 23 cm.), and a large polygonal marble plaque. Many archaic architectural and sculptural fragments were found as filling material in im- perial Roman foundations. The Roman Empire level was destroyed by conflagration in the late antique period. "The area exposed is part of the settlement men- tioned by Strabo 14.1.5. Habitation ceases to the E where the terrain slopes down towards the temple. A sounding c. 6o m. w of the Nw corner of the stylobate merely produced a drainage channel run- ning N-s in a broken tile fill, crossing the corner of an earlier limestone foundation. In the low area between the w settlement and the temple probably lay part of the grove mentioned by Strabo and in- scriptions. Clearance of the temple area (cf. IstMitt 21 [1971] 92) was continued along the N and w sides (pl. 34, fig. 18) to protect the site and to re- cover the results of the excavations of 1906-1913, since obscured by vegetation. It turned out that a considerable amount of material had remained unrecorded, e.g. blocks of an imperial arched struc- ture, stone furniture, three archaic round altars (pl. 35, fig. 23), coffer relief fragments of the Apollo temple, Byzantine blocks, etc. In this operation we cleared the lower steps of the N and w stylobate, the NW corner of the temple, and the round ash altar belonging to the period of archaic expansion in front of the E fagade. "In the storage museum we set up large sections of the entablature and other blocks of the early Hellenistic naiskos; also a selection of inscriptions relevant to the sanctuary and archaic sculpture. An important new find (not in situ) was a 'Boundary stone of the temenos of the proshetairoi of Aristo- demos,' probably the stephanophoros of 306/5 B.c. who had a cult in Didyma. The 'limestone slab' Rehm, Didyma II, No. ioi may be another bound- ary stone of the same temenos. "Byzantine blocks were numerous and raise the question whether other Byzantine buildings ex- isted in addition to the 'basilica of the adyton' built into the temple, Didyma I, 29ff. Dr. U. Pechlow is studying this material." Dr. Tuchelt published a Hellenistic votive relief from Didyma in AA 1972, 87-105. His Vorarbeiten zu einer Topographie von Didyma (IstMitt Beiheft 9) is about to appear. MILETUS. In IstMitt 21 (i97i) o09-II9 Volkmar von Graeve publishes two fragments of an early seventh century Milesian vase with a mythological design of horses and an archer (Herakles?). For the 1970 campaign, cf. TiirkArkDerg 19:i (1970) 121-126. Professor G. Kleiner kindly reports that the season of 1972 was mostly concerned with study and publication of previously excavated material. The installation of a local museum is in progress, as is the anastylosis of the Ionic stoa along the sacred street between the Delphinium and the Nymphaeum. PRIENE. Terracottas from the old excavations at Priene are discussed by Eva T6pferwein-Hoffmann in IstMitt 21 (i97i) 125- EPHEsUs. Reports on the 1970 campaign appeared in TiirkArkDerg 19:2 (1970) 185-194 and AnatSt 21 (1971) 37; for the 1968 season cf. also JOAI 49 (1968-69) Grabungen 1968, 13-18. A Hellenistic head found during cleaning operations near the temple of Hadrian is published in TiirkArkDerg 19:1 (1970) 213-215. About the 1972 campaign Professor H. Vetters kindly reports the following: "During the spring campaign, we partly cleared a large substructure which may be that of the Asklepieion known from inscriptions. We continued work in the caldarium of the so-called Varius Bath, imperial Thermae at the NE corner of the official Agora. Four Roman portrait heads were found here. In the fall campaign, we reached the w limit of the two private houses-on-the-slope dug in recent years. The wall paintings were largely consolidated. Deep soundings were made to check the earliest build- ing stages of the Thermae of Scholastikia. In the</page><page sequence="18">186 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 77 Artemision, the anastylosis of one of the columns continued. In the area of the altar complex, more early altar structures were excavated. Among the finds were a female head belonging to the late classical altar reliefs and an archaic ram of ivory. In the fall we also began with the anastylosis of the fagade of the library of Celsus. The architecture of the buildings cleared by the Turkish authorities s of the church of St. John is now being recorded, especially the atrium of the immediate predecessor of the great cruciform domed church built under Justinian." ERYTHRAI. No excavation took place in 1972. The study of the site continues. A hoard of bronze coins from Erythrai, now in the Izmir Museum, dated to the Early Hellenistic period, is published by P. Betancourt in ANSMuseum Notes 17 (I970) 23-39. BAYRAKLI-OLD SMYRNA. Professor Ekrem Akurgal continued his studies and excavation of the temple area. He kindly reports that the plans and isometric views of the various stages of the temple have been prepared. The columns have also been recon- structed in detail. The first architectural volume of Bayrakli will present these temple studies as well as a report on some of the houses contemporary with the temple. This will include some houses ex- cavated during the first series of campaigns at Bay- rakli. IZMIR. Dr. Musa Baran kindly reports that a marble head of Hermes was found in Izmir dur- ing construction work opposite the Hisar Camii; the same site had fragments of Roman mosaic and tiles. SARDIS. The literature on Sardis is growing an- nually. The report on the I4th campaign (1971) by Andrew Ramage appeared in BASOR 206 (I972) 9-39; special research is to be found in Studies presented to George M. A. Hanfmann (Fogg Art Museum Monographs in Art and Ar- chaeology II, 1971); Crawford H. Greenewalt, Jr. published Fikellura pottery from Sardis in Cali- fornia Studies in Classical Archaeology 4 (I97i) i53-I80; and the first two monographs of the final publication series have appeared, G. E. Bates, By- zantine Coins (Cambridge 1971) and John G. Ped- ley, Ancient Literary Sources on Sardis (Cam- bridge 1972). Professor Hanfmann kindly reports the follow- ing on the season of 1972, which was initially di- rected by Crawford H. Greenewalt, Jr.: "At the Artemis Temple ten soundings were made to detect possible traces of an archaic dipteral temple. No archaic architectural evidence was found. It was proved that the foundations of the E wall were originally planned to carry a solid wall, not a door. The addition of the door and the finely worked Hellenistic steps, and the change to a two-cella temple probably occurred in the Hel- lenistic period. Noteworthy among the finds is a lead plumb bob having an iron ring at the top. It weighed 1,340 grams. "The erosion of the E bank of the Pactolus was endangering the temple and precinct. The expedi- tion enlisted the aid of the State Water Works, Erosion Division, to build groins and bulldoze a new channel, thus averting any immediate danger to the temple. "At the gymnasium complex several projects were undertaken to complete partially excavated units and prepare the area for opening to the pub- lic. Excavation of the rooms w of the synagogue, started in 1966, was completed; their connection with the synagogue has been found tenuous and the rooms have been redesignated BE-A through C. In BE-C, at the N wall was an inscribed marble base, 2.62 m. long. The inscription records a dedi- cation under Geta (A.D. 211-212) by Glykon, son of Glykon, of statues of the 'children of Kore,' namely Koros, Eupo(sia), and a third female whose name is lost. A trench in the s apsidal hall (BSH) proved that the platform with the inscription of a statue of Lucius Verus, known since 1958 (BASOR 154 [1959] I4) is bonded into the w wall. Since the Verus statue was made for the podium, the entire central part of the gymnasium cannot have been completed much before A.D. 161. Major clearing was done in hall BE-W ('Aleipterion') where the earth supporting the w wall was removed and the stepped pool excavated. The latter revealed a large drain, c. 2.20 m. high, which goes N for 41 m. from the center of the semicircular N end of the pool (pl. 34, fig. 20). Three shafts lead into it from above; they in turn have sideways extensions at the top. In a niche of the w wall was found an inscribed base bearing a six-line poem telling that Basiliskos, governor of Lydia, set up a fountain with snakes of gilded bronze which 'spouted water from their mouths.' A late fourth century date is probable. Earth was removed from the E side of the central hall (BCH) to relieve pressure on the common wall. Here we found marble-revetted,</page><page sequence="19">1973] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 187 circular pools at the ground level of the semicircu- lar niches on either side of the central door. "To make the area available to visitors, the level of the palaestra was lowered by removing c. 4000 cubic m. of earth. Only in the Nw corner and very sporadically along the E side was the original mar- ble paving extant. A mosaic of red, white, and slate- blue geometric pattern was uncovered in the E colonnade. "At the synagogue the task of lifting, consolidat- ing and replacing the floor mosaics was completed. Cast cement replicas were put in place of the origi- nal inscription panels and the apse mosaic, which were taken to the museum in Manisa. "Welcome collaboration was the investigation of the marble sculpture and the quarries at Magara Deresi stream, an affluent of the Pactolus, by geol- ogists from the project on Sciences Auxiliary to Archaeology, Rome. Preliminary indications are that the bulk of sculpture from Sardis is made of local marble." PERGAMON. The excavations at Pergamon con- tinued in 1971 under the direction of Professor O. Ziegenaus; in 1972 Dr. Wolfgang Radt took over the direction. Dr. Radt kindly reports the follow- ing about the work in 1971-72: "In the fall of 1971, work at the Asklepieion was restricted to the organization of storerooms, in- ventorying of the finds, and preparation of the publication. The clearance of the Demeter terrace continued. Two columns with entablature were re-erected in the N stoa. The main altar in front of the temple was restored, including the cornice, in cut stone; the fragments of the Roman E pedi- ment of the temple were put together. The N steps were consolidated. Soundings yielded new evidence on the course of the temenos walls in the four principal building periods of the sanctuary. The first, pre-Philetairos period has three sub-phases. It is now ascertained that the Demeter temple from the first stood on the same low rocky hill which still has the temple ruins. Since every rebuilding entailed a lowering of the level to enlarge the ter- race, no phase is preserved beyond foundation level. "The Trajaneum was cleared further. In two soundings, sizeable walls of pre-Roman construc- tions came out immediately below the E pavement of the temple court. Walls and a stepped street of the same orientation were also found in the w sup- porting vaults of the temple. This pre-Roman stratum has two phases; under the temple it is covered by a thick burnt level. We shall have to see if these constructions are connected with the Hel- lenistic buildings on the E part of the upper acropo- lis. "In 1972, an emergency excavation was under- taken at Kapikaya c. 5 km. Nw of the citadel of Pergamon, where a rockcut sanctuary lies high above the confluence of two streams, cf. A. Conze, Altertiimer von Pergamon I, I, 128 and Beiblatt 2 (1912), maps Altertiimer von Pergamon I, pls. i-II. The site had been disturbed by looters and needed prompt rescue operations. "In the w part of the site (see ill. i) is a natural cave (D3) formed by a crevice and a fallen large boulder (pl. 33, fig. 15). A spring emerges from the rear wall; many ancient conduits attest to the rich supply of water. Rockcut ledges in the cave could have served to receive votives, other cuttings in the natural rock belong to ancient stelae and round bases. Small niches exist in the w wall of the cave, made to hold votive plaques. "A spacious terrace existed s of the cave (CD/2) with a bench at least along two sides (NW, sw). The N side is formed by a vertically cut cliff with a large niche, probably for a seated statue. Post- holes in the rock were for a shelter in front of the niche. Rockcut steps in FG/3-4 may belong to a temenos wall. At H/3 is the entry of an ancient path up the mountain. "The described elements are pre-Roman; the following belong to the early imperial period: a stone building (pl. 33, figs. 16-17, plan IKL/3-5) with platforms in its N and s part, a level center with niches on three sides, and a door to the w where a terrace exists. The building was roofed with Roman tiles of the Corinthian system. A ter- race, partly rockcut, lies at H/3 with a staircase at the w side. At EF/3 are Roman water basins and at CD/2, a large Roman water reservoir. "Excavations on the slope below the cave yielded small finds missing in the cave: pottery (dishes, cups, plain ware), hundreds of Hellenistic lamps (pl. 34, fig. 21) and unguentaria. The lamps range from the early third to the first century B.c., with a concentration in the second, Pergamon's great period. The cult is identified by terracottas and a fragmentary inscription as belonging to Meter Kybele, much worshipped at Pergamon, cf. A. Conze and P. Schazmann, Mamurt Kale (Jdl Suppl. 9). Coins corroborate the Hellenistic cult.</page><page sequence="20">188 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 77 1 q  J F_ I p I  , I tr I # 1 -----  t_ _L I II ?Ilk l -. i.

All architectural fragments (capitals, bases, cornices, parapet) date to the Roman Empire period, they probably fell from the collapsed front terrace. The building in IKL/3-5 will be studied further (a Mithraeum?). "A new general plan i:iooo of Pergamon is being prepared (acropolis, Asklepieion, Via Tecta, amphitheater, Roman theater with Virankapi, Se- rapis temple). The area of the Hellenistic city is being prepared for excavation and a grid laid out over a 200 x 300 m. area between the upper acropo- lis and the Demeter terrace." APHRODISIAS. Professor Kenan Erim published a report on the 1970 campaign in TiirkArkDerg 9g:i (1970) 55-86, cf. AnatSt 21 ('970) 25-31, and a general article in National Geographic June 1972, 766-791. He kindly provides the following report and illustrations of the 1972 season: "Theater. Excavations in the theater concentrated at first on the removal of a large 'slice' of earth left in the s half of the cavea. Simultaneously, the trench started in 1971 behind the N stage building was continued (North post scaenam). It became necessary to dismantle part of the Byzantine wall blocking the central vaulted tunnel of the stage building. A dedication to the emperor Valens (364- 378) by a governor of Caria Antonius Tatianus was extracted from the wall at this point. Removal of a layer of stucco from one of the other faces of the base revealed another, earlier inscription honor- ing Titus Fl. Sallustius, a notable Aphrodisian of the early Imperial period. The North post scaenam area revealed a stylobate not parallel to the Byzan- tine stage-blocking wall, also two column bases, a shaft, and Corinthian capital fragments. The area stretching E before this portico was paved with well-joined marble slabs (pl. 36, fig. 31). Two in- scribed statue-bases were discovered in front of the stylobate. One of them supported a statue of Flavius Palmatus, a 'vicar' of Asia. The statue itself was found almost intact, fallen in front of the base (pl. 37, fig-. 37). The head of the statue was in- serted separately (pl. 37, fig. 35). The style suggests a date in the early fifth century. To the s of Flavius Palmatus, the statue of a young boy, also in full toga, was discovered lying on its back. Its head had also been inserted separately, and it is pos- sible that a portrait head found nearby and datable to the fourth century was affixed to the (early Ro- man) statue in later times (pl. 37, fig. 34). The stylobate discovered to the N continued to the s. The area lying in front of it was still paved with marble slabs. The most intriguing feature of the South post scaenam trench was a podium-like struc- ture nestled against the Byzantine stage-wall. It</page><page sequence="21">1973] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 189 consisted of nine well-fitted steps joined at a right angle by eight steps perpendicular to the stage-wall, cf. pl. 36, fig. 31. Near the podium, an inscribed statue-base was extracted from the Byzantine stage wall. It honored a certain Dulcitius, perhaps Aelius Claudius Dulcitius, proconsul of Asia in 361-363, and indicated that it had been set up 'in front of the baths.' This implies the presence of baths as- sociated with or located near the theater. A candi- date for such a thermal establishment is the com- plex of ruins s of the South post scaenam trench. "Portico of Tiberius and Basilica: The basilica, oriented roughly N-s, is probably close to ioo m. in length. Our 1972 operations revealed about 20 m. of its nave and its E aisle, including the colonnade of its w wing. An impressive amount of architec- tural elements was found in the nave area. Many frieze fragments belonged to the garlanded masks variety, typical of the frieze of the portico of Ti- berius. A number of the column bases separating the aisles from the nave was discovered in situ. The nave is about io m. wide, the aisles about 6. It seems certain that an upper storey existed over the aisles. Smaller double Corinthian columns, above the Ionic order of the main colonnades, were used here, their intercolumniations fitted with parapets with relief decoration: stylized floral motifs, Eros 'surfing' on a sea-horse, an incom- plete Leda (or Ganymede?) scene framed by a torch-bearing Eros. "East Odeon: Excavations to the N along the curve of the cavea brought to light the sw corner of an elaborate building complex adjacent to the Odeon. A N-S corridor and part of two rooms were discovered; the northernmost chamber had a geometric mosaic floor. The nature of this com- plex is not yet clear. Between the external wall of the corridor and the curving wall of the Odeon, five lifesize and over-lifesize statues were uncovered dumped in a line close to the corridor wall. All are headless, some lack limbs, yet they form an im- pressive group. The largest statue shows a colossal male figure in full military regalia (pl. 37, fig. 36). His belted cuirass is decorated with a pair of grif- fins, a Medusa head in the center and a flying Nike to the right, partly concealed by the paluda- mentum. By the left foot, a helmet, topped with the figure of a sphinx and an elaborate crest whose plumes still bear traces of red paint. A signature naming 'Apollonius Aster, son of Chrysippus' was carved on the cranium piece of the helmet. Next to the cuirass statue, two male figures in himation were discovered. The fourth figure is also over- lifesize, and male. The fifth is a nude male torso with part of its garment preserved draped under the groin. Similarity in stylistic detail reinforces the idea that the five statues formed a group. It is tempting to think of an imperial family of the second century. "The foundations of the museum of Aphrodisias, located in a large field behind the present storage depot, were begun in the summer of 1972." For the prehistoric excavations at Aphrodisias, see above under Bronze Age sites. 9EqTEPE-9IVRIL. The Graeco-Persian relief at 9eqtepe carved on the rock at the base of the larger of two tumuli was reported by Dr. Nezih Firath AJA 72 (1968) 144 and 74 (1970) 175. The relief is now discussed and illustrated in photographs and in a drawing by Tulay Ergil in TiirkArkDerg 19:2 (I970) 121-122, 157-159. In 1969 the relief was dam- aged by looters so that the most important detail of the man riding in the chariot was lost, although fragments of the dynamited relief were collected and put in the Ugak Museum. The tumuli at 9eq- tepe are in need of prompt official excavations. SELqIKLER AREA. The rescue operations under- taken by Dr. Nezih Firatlh and his team in various looted sites are described TiirkArkDerg 19:2 (1970) 118-121. Roman cemeteries had been looted and looked like "bombed out areas." In A'aqbeyli, s of Selqikler, a prehistoric cemetery has been de- stroyed; the villagers also dug tombs of the Lydian period which had terracotta painted sarcophagi. The designs, painted in a simple style in dark red on reddish buff, represent birds, hunters, simple ornaments. One of these sarcophagi is in the An- kara Museum. AFYON. The quarries of Dokymeion-Iscehisar 23 km. NE of Afyon are discussed in detail by J. RiSder in Jdl 86 (i97I) 253-312, cf. AJA 74 (1970) 175- PEssINUS. Professor P. Lambrechts conducted his sixth campaign of excavations in the summer of 1972. In the two seasons 1971-72 the main discov- eries were made in the area w of the temple. Re- ports on the 1970 campaign appeared in TiirkArk- Derg 19:I (1970) 133-142 and AnatSt 21 (i97i) 32-33. For I97I, De Brug 1971, 4, 253-265 gives the first drawings of the complex temple-theater-stoa from E to w, descending from the entrance of the temple to the plain. M. Waelkens in Byzantion</page><page sequence="22">190 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 77 41 (1971) 349-373 discusses ancient testimonia for the river of Pessinus (Gallos) and in RBPhil 50 (1972) 78-83 publishes a late Phrygian tomb stela from Pessinus, reused as a fountain in Sivrihisar. This stela has double-door designs on front and back. In 1972, Professor Lambrechts kindly reports, most of the efforts were concentrated on the excava- tion of the area in front (w) of the temple. On the slope, more foundations and steps of the thea- ter have been excavated. The latter had a central section of 12 m. width corresponding to the axis of the temple; the two wings of the theater are slightly curved. This complex now is interpreted as a Roman temple theater. The date of the temple proper has now been determined at c. A.D. 20-25, as explained in an article in AntCl 41 (1972) 156- 173, in which the pottery found in the foundations is discussed in detail. The theater has only been cleared for about one-third of the cavea; the artificial fill consists of earth and rubble. The area at the foot of the hill had Ionic stoae at least along three sides. The E stoa is 26.38 m. long. The date is first century A.D. The stoa was destroyed by con- flagration, probably in the third century. Tiles and charred beams lie in the debris. Over this destruction level, simple houses were built in Byzantine times. The excavation of the canalization system was frus- trated by new flashfloods in the early summer of 1972. There will be no further excavation of the valley but the new campaigns will concentrate on the area of the temple and the slope of the hill to the w. ROMAN ROADS. Dr. David H. French kindly re- ports that he "has been checking the archaeology of the Roman road system in Central Anatolia, as known from the modern literature. As a result, complete sections of the routes between Nicomedia (Izmit) and Ancyra (Ankara) and Ancyra--col. Archelais (Aksaray) will have to be revised on future maps. It is now possible to suggest a new location for Juliopolis: Sarilar near 9ayirhan. La- gania-Anastioupolis would then be situated at Hiiyiik-Dikmen." ESKI?EHIR. At a site c. 25 km. E of Eskigehir, Alpiibucai,, a tumulus was opened by the Director of the Eskigehir Museum Miss Giksen Oziiesen and Dr. Nezih Flrathl, to whom we owe this re- port. The tumulus (Bozylr, Kocaklzlar) is very large and was built on a Hittite site. It contains an elaborate set of three interconnected chambers approached by a stone-built dromos with flat roof. The rooms are all built of baked bricks, vaulted and plastered with simple painted decoration. Two rooms lie on axis; in the far room stood two mar- ble, lidless sarcophagi, one with Ionic column dec- oration on the outside. The third room is at right angles to the first. This had burials on the floor. All three rooms are off center in one quadrant of the tumulus. The tumulus was presumably used in two periods, Lydian (the dromos of which sur- vives) and Roman (the tomb chambers). Two os- suaries in the shape of spouted basins, made of marble, were covered with stone slabs, one a reused Doric capital. The small finds are of the Roman period: gold necklaces, earrings, bracelets, amber figurines (a horse, a Telephoros); objects of other metals, glass, lamps, and fragments of an ivory kline; a coin of Tiberius. The material will be published by Miss Goksen Ozilesen of the Eski.gehir Museum and Mr. Siimer Atasoy of the Istanbul Museum. ESKI?EHIR(?) TERRACOTTA. A Roman terracotta recently acquired by the Istanbul Museum is pub- lished by Mehmet I. Tunay in Belleten 142 (1972) 137-143. It shows the head of Cybele set on a base flanked by two attendants, one of whom is lost. The preserved figure is a double-flute player, surely, as Mr. Tunay suggests, part of the tradition rep- resented in the Phrygian Kybele-Kubaba group from Bogazkoy. AEZANI. Professor R. Naumann discusses the ef- fects of the earthquake of 1970 in AA 1971, 214-221. DASKYLEION. The Graeco-Persian tomb stelai from Daskyleion continue to attract attention, cf. a discussion by H. Mtibius in AA 1971, 442-455 and a general article by H. Metzger in AntCl 40 (1970) 505-525- BITHYNIA. A tumulus with a built chamber tomb near Gerede, c. 40 km. E of Bolu, is discussed by Wolfram Hoepfner in AthMitt 86 (i971) 125-139- The tomb had been plundered. The tomb chamber is barrel vaulted, the dromos has a gabled roof. The date is estimated to be third century B.c. BOLU-CLAUDIOPOLIS. Dr. Nezih Firath kindly reports that in April 1972 he investigated remnants of the theater which had been cut by a widening of the main road to Istanbul. The new cuttings re- vealed two rows of seats and part of the diazoma in section (pl. 35, fig. 28). Some architectural frag- ments which in the early 1930's came to the Istan- bul Museum evidently belonged to this theater,</page><page sequence="23">1973] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 191 e.g. a pilaster fragment with elaborate ornament (pl. 38, fig. 39). Dr. Firath in 1965 had noticed and reported a foundation of Roman concrete (pl. 36, fig. 32) which evidently belonged to a large temple on the citadel of Claudiopolis. In 1971 during the construction of a new school building next to the foundation (which had been made into a water reservoir) more elements of the temple were found: Ionic column drums c. 1.30 m. in diameter and capitals (pl. 36, fig. 33); some en- tablature blocks of complete dimensions, frieze fragments with large Medusa heads, parts of an inscription. These are of pink marble of Bithynian origin. As Dr. Firath points out, this temple may be connected with Hadrian's visits to Claudiopolis- Bithynium, the home of Antinous. Perhaps this is the temple represented on coins, cf. D. Magie, Ro- man Rule in Asia Minor (Princeton 1950) II, 622. There are many Roman walls in this citadel area which will be recorded on the plan of the ancient city. West of the citadel is the necropolis, where tomb stones have turned up. Dr. Firath will pub- lish the new discoveries at Bolu in a separate article. IZMIT. In the w necropolis area outside of the ancient city (Turgut Mahallesi) a tumulus with tomb chamber is reported by Dr. Nezih Firath. The chamber is barrel-vaulted and rectangular in plan with a short dromos and stone door. In the chamber were three sarcophagi, two along the long walls, one at right angles along the rear wall. For the topography of Izmit cf. the plan in the guide by Nezih Firathl Izmit Sehri ve Eski Eserleri Reh- beri (1971). A very large sarcophagus was found in the Izmit necropolis in 1972. MARMARA-PROKONNESOS. Dr. Nezih Firath and Dr. Nugin Asgari of the Istanbul Museum kindly report the continuation of their work near the marble quarries on the island of Marmara, cf. AJA 76 (1972) 186. An open-air exhibition area was arranged near the site of Palatia where the unfin- ished sarcophagi and architectural members (e.g. columns, capitals, column bases more than 2 m. in diameter, architraves) from the quarries are set out for display and study. They show the state in which the pieces were ready for shipping. There are inscriptions in some of the quarries giving the owners' names. Much of the material dates to the Justinian period but discoveries of earlier quarry- ing operations are expected. SILE. Dr. Flrathl and Dr. Asgari also report that they undertook a rescue underwater excavation near a shipwreck 400 m. off the coast at 6 m. depth in the Black Sea off Sile. The site had been reported by divers. The shipwreck contained unfinished marble (some greenish marble) columns, ortho- stats, a sarcophagus lid of first century A.D. type, and some statuary. The most remarkable is a 4.60 m. high roughly blocked-out cuirass statue of an emperor, perhaps meant to be Trajan, now set up near the entrance to the Istanbul Museum com- plex (pl. 38, fig. 38). MARMARA EREGLISI-PERINTHOS. The funerary mon- ument found in 1964 in the necropolis of Perinthos (Kamaradere), reported in AJA 69 (1965) 149, has now been restored and put on dis- play in the Museum in Istanbul. With it are set up two stelae of legionnaires (aquilifer and buci- nator) found in Istanbul, AJA 70 (1966) 159- OLBA. For a discussion of the date of the Zeus temple at Olba, cf. C. Barker AA 1971, 37-54 (mid- second century B.C.). TARSUS. A sounding undertaken in 1970 in the small hill in the center of Tarsus (Yegiltepe, not Gizlii Kule) is reported upon by Siiheyla Kegkil, then Director of the Antakya Museum, in AnatSt 21 (1971) 40-41. The finds so far are Islamic and Byzantine. ADANA-AEGAEA (Yumurtalik). AnatSt 21 (0970) 42-43 has a report on rescue excavations at the Ro- man site of Aegaea-Yumurtalik on the coast s of Ceyhan. Roman graves, wall foundations, ruined houses were found in soundings. KAYsERI. The new Museum displays an interest- ing collection of classical material from the Kayseri area. A tumulus recently dug in Kayseri yielded an excellent grave group of Augustan date: glass vessels, some unusually fine, onyx vessels, silver ware, gold jewelry. Director Mehmet Eskioglu will publish this tomb group which is the gratifying result of timely rescue digging. KEBAN AREA. A?VAN. For interim reports on the excavations of the British Institute at Ankara in the Agvan area, cf. Keban Reports 1969, 35-37; Ke- ban Reports 1970, 55-62; AnatSt 21 (1971) 5-12. In 1972, Dr. David H. French kindly reports, "the entire resources of staff and money were concen- trated on the site of Agvan Kale and the excavation of Taskun, Kale, Tagkun Mevkii and Kurupinar was left until 1973. For the Medieval phase at Af- van a large and imposing building, much altered and restored in later phases, was excavated in the NW sector of the mound. The 'Late Roman' struc-</page><page sequence="24">192 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 77 ture was empty of pottery and other datable evi- dence; its chronological position floats between Ist century B.c. and Ioth century A.D. A more or less complete ground plan for this structure has now been recovered. The Late Hellenistic buildings, productive in earlier seasons, were almost as barren as the later structures. One quite accidental but important find was a series of Medieval kilns. From the debris of the best preserved kiln came one complete, green-glazed sgraffiato bowl, several large fragments of the same type and decoration, and numerous sherds illustrating the various stages of production. A date in the i3th-I4th centuries is stratigraphically demonstrable. The general project work had a very useful season. Research was car- ried out in geography and geomorphology, regional studies, anthropology, ornithology, agricultural bot- any, and animal husbandry. Two topographers continued work on land-use and soil maps, and site location." PAGNIK ORENI. Mr. R. Harper concluded his excavations of the Roman fort in 1971, cf. Keban Reports 1969, 95-98; Keban Reports 1970, 123-125; AnatSt 21 (I971) 10-12, with plan. A6IN AND KALAYCIK AREA. Dr. Omit Serdaroglu supervises the work at three sites: i) Kalaycik, a mound and terrace with Islamic, Byzantine and Ro- man levels overlying Bronze Age remains; a Hel- lenistic pithos cemetery lies w of the mound. 2) Kilise Yazisi, a Roman fortress on the w bank of the Karasu. 3) Agin Kalecikler, a mound with By- zantine and Roman buildings in the upper levels. A necropolis to the N and w contained many Roman tombs from the second and third centuries A.D. The tombs were made as cist-graves, rockcut cists, and inhumations. Tomb gifts included coins (Tra- jan to Commodus), bronze and gold jewelry (e.g. gold eye- and mouth-pieces), glass vessels, unguen- taria, wooden caskets; cf. Keban Reports 1969, 23-30 and Keban Reports 1970, 25-43. HARABA. Reports on the Simgat fortress near Ha- raba on the Murat river, excavated by Professor Baki O-giin, appeared in Keban Reports 1969, 39- 46; Keban Reports 1970, 75-78; AnatSt 21 (I970) 45-46. BYZANTINE SITES ISTANBUL. A twelfth century church was found when the new buildings of the Fen Fakiiltesi were constructed in the University area, Dr. Nezih Firathl reports. This is near Vezneciler caddesi, cf. the churches discussed CahArch 5 (195I) 163-178. The plan has been established. At Aksaray, close to Muratpaga Camii, a large Early Christian hypogaeum was investigated by Dr. Nezih Firath. The building measures c. 25 x 5 m. and has eight rooms. A plan has been made and the building is being protected. It belongs to the necropolis area of Constantinople, cf. Tortu- lae, Studien zu altchristlichen und byzantinischen Monumenten (1966) 131-139. TEKIRDA6-BARBAROS. During building operations a large sixth century building with Corinthian capitals was encountered within the enclosure walls, Dr. Nezih Firath reports. SARDIS. Professor Hanfmann reports that in 1972 "Hans Buchwald undertook the study of Church E (pl. 36, fig. 29) at sector PN. Inside the church five pits were put down to the bottom of the foun- dation walls which are c. 2 m. high. The founda- tions are built of re-used ashlar, brick and mortar. In the top of the foundation walls was a system of wooden tie-beams. The sounding to the E of the apse revealed an exedra wall of alternating courses of brick and rubble which may belong to the apse of an earlier, larger church. The wall was decorated with frescoes and modelled plaster; among the surviving motifs is a cross. No other walls belong- ing to the earlier building have yet been found. Finds in the interior included colored window glass, many colored glass wall mosaic tesserae, and several pieces of glass from saucer-shaped dumps which had formed the 'stock' from which mosaic cubes were cut. A study of the architectural frag- ments revealed that the exterior was embellished by polychrome brickwork. Buchwald reconstructs the church as one of the five-dome type, represented by a small group in Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece and Calabria and hitherto unknown in Asia Minor or Constantinople. He dates the construction of Church E to the mid-i3th century, during the period when the Byzantine emperors resided at Manisa while the Latins controlled Constantinople (1222-1261)." U?AK-SELQIKLER. For a report on the excavation campaigns of the churches at Selgikler cf. Tiirk- ArkDerg 19:2 (1970) lo09-160, with plans of the area and the s church which overlies a Roman temple.

AJA 76 (1972) 188. Professor Metzger kindly reports the follow- ing: "In the atrium, under the Ottoman occupa- tion level, the excavators found an Early Christian and a Byzantine level attested by additions of walls on the N stylobate of the atrium and by frescoes on the Nw wall. The mosaics in the porti- coes were again in good condition (pl. 38, figs. 40 and 42) under a layer of burnt debris. In the N nave the mosaic floors continue. Here several capi- tals (pl. 38, fig. 41) and other fragments of sculp- tural decoration were found." KNIDos. Professor Iris C. Love writes that in 1972 "on the Nw mole of the Trireme Harbor, Byzantine church E was partially uncovered. The central apse with a synthronon is flanked by two smaller ones. The church was divided by two col- onnades, apparently robbed, into a nave and two aisles, once decorated with mosaics. The overall dimensions are c. 30 x 17 m. The narthex was also embellished with mosaics. A two-line inscription in an ansate panel records the laying of the mosaic by a certain Kleopatra." KEBAN AREA. A Byzantine church and building level are reported for Agin, Keban Reports 1969, pl. 28. ALAHAN MONASTERY. For the 1970 season, cf. TiirkArkDerg i9:I (1970) 95-98, AnatSt 21 (i97') 12-13. Professor Michael R. E. Gough kindly writes the following on the continuation of excavations in 1972: "A test made near the w end of the Basilica led to the discovery of an extensive complex of cis- terns, drains and sophisticated arrangements for flood-water disposal, all going to show how the monks coped with the problem that still sometimes threatens the site. A series of 'rooms' was built below the s fortification wall. These cistern-like rooms could be used equally well for water storage in the summer and for containment of a flood in the rainy months. Walls of masonry, or hewn from the rock, were built on an E-W axis to deflect the flow of water from its natural southward course. Very vulnerable was the Basilica, and flood-water was channeled immediately to the E of the church and even diverted into a drain that passed under the floor of the apse. All this water was collected in the cisterns and finally allowed to escape through a huge arched conduit with a tiled floor. The con- duit itself was constructed of fine brickwork. A large amount of dating evidence was recovered from the drainage system. Among the coins were several small fifth century examples pre-dating the reforms of Anastasius; a hoard of nine bronze folles in excellent condition, none later than the early years of Justinian I. Valuable too was the datable pottery discovered; Roman (North Afri- can?) fine ware, the local imitation, well fired and pattern burnished, and a large collection of sherds of a specialized type so far known only at Alahan and Da' Pazarl. This coarse buff ware, decorated in a fugitive red paint with fish, doves and, some- times, with crosses, as well as with spiraliform and zigzag motifs, we call 'monastic ware.' Its distribu- tion, except in a tiny part of Isauria, is not re- corded." BRYN MAWR COLLEGE</page><page sequence="26">FIG. I. Nor?untepe, citadel level VII FIG. 2. Tepecik, FIG. 2.
