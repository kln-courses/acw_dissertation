<plain_text><page sequence="1">Unity and Ensemble Contrasting Ideals in Romantic Music BRIAN PRIMMER "It needs courage to be a romantic because it involves taking risks."' So wrote Stendhal in his essay Racine et Shakespeare; and no one ever penned a truer phrase. Taking risks, however, seems to be a matter of individual choice at heart, rather than a group activity. So it is not surprising that the cult of individuality should have become one of the strongest planks in the true Romantic platform. "I am made unlike anyone I have ever met; I will even venture to say that I am like no one in the whole world. I may be no better, but at least I am different."2 The implications of these asser- tive phrases from the opening paragraphs of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Confessions resounded across the Romantic years with irresistible c1lat, drawing sympathetic echoes from many thoughtful minds but especially from those who lived on the eastern side of the Rhine. In Ger- many the ecstasies of Sturm und Drang had em- phasized the importance and significance of per- sonal experience, barbing general certainty with knots of individual doubt, and calling into ques- tion the very foundations of knowledge and of rational skill. Men literally went mad pursuing self-awareness and seeking some conviction on which they could reshape their lives. But always they were driven back to Self, to what they in- wardly experienced as primary and what they also felt or hoped to be eternal. Only the individual is of interest. Nothing outside of you matters, but solely you your- self. 0148-2076/82/030097 + 44$00.50 C 1981 by The Regents of the University of California. 97</page><page sequence="2">19TH CENTURY MUSIC It is just his individuality that is the primary and eternal element in man. To make a cult of the forma- tion and development of this individuality would be a kind of divine egotism.3 Considered as "the primary and eternal ele- ment in man," individuality and its many over- tones came to usurp the place in men's esteem previously held by Reason. From the moment of its proclamation the way was cleared for fairy- tale, for myth and monster to resume their an- cient power over human kind: and once the uni- versal significance of the Ring's symbolic figures could take its place in what Bismarck was to call "the logic of events," the work of Sigmund Freud was inescapable, that of Jung and Adler inevita- ble. Increasingly as time went by the word "anal- ysis" grew needful of the prefix "psycho-"; for individual consciousness grew daily more self- conscious and men were fractured within them- selves as well as alienated from one another. Although following tradition Goya named his composition Capricho, the deaf, isolated, and sickened painter was being no more than accu- rate when, in 1799, he prophesied the monstrous apparitions which might emanate from the pres- ent sleep of Reason. The phrase "divine egotism" also had its own significance for, at one and the same time, it looked backward to the concept of genius so powerful in the times of Sturm und Drang and foward to the generally numinous suffusion of the high Romantic years. It gave to the extremi- ties of egotism a sanction which could be di- vinely justified and which, unfortunately for Ro- manticism as a whole, has led to much confusion in the public's minds. For individuality is not the same as egotism, as I hope we shall discover in this present quest; and far from being a species of insanity, a kind of foul disease from which the healthful spirits of the Classics stand immune, Romanticism is a sort of comprehensive balance overall, though one achieved with difficulty and with forces more disparate than before. Infusing tragedy with comedy and darkness with a myr- iad shades of glowing light, it attempts to recon- cile art with life itself, to give free play to imagination and yet to discipline that freedom through imagination's formal shaping hand. This was perhaps the most challenging task ever undertaken by human spirits in the West and, as such, did mean taking risks. Whatever else Ro- mantic artists may have lacked, the true origi- nals among them rarely lost their individual courage or their nerve when faced with crisis. Horrified at times they may have been; but paralyzed-hardly ever. And even then but momentarily, and not sufficiently to lose their self-awareness or their ultimate control. For in- dividuality is disciplined and firmly based on feeling. Egotism, on the other hand, is wild and leads directly to self-indulgent sentiment. It is just this trait of courageous and person- ally disciplined individuality which makes true Romanticism so difficult to comprehend, so easy to misconstrue: for it throws the very concept into doubt. In a telling way every Romantic artist was forced to be his own creature. Lacking much centrally accepted authority, each was driven to become his own God, his own priest and his own law-giver. Attempts to see them otherwise can lead to the fundamental and yet familiar error of viewing Romanticism everywhere and at all times as an entity. To consider Romanticism a concrete international or even supranationalpe- riod, gives it a largely spurious unity; for Roman- ticism is as many-faceted as is any other area of psychological activity. Bearing in mind therefore the frequency with which the sea and its attend- ant moods appear as metaphors or symbols in contemporary works, we would do better to con- ceive of Romanticism as a kind of complex fluc- tuation in the soul, a prolonged eddying in each affected human consciousness, a recurrent ebb- ing and flowing of personal energies and skills across a continental field which, on the surface, may seem to be opposed to one another or even mutually exclusive. With Romanticism, how- ever, everything is possible-even Classicism of a kind; and we should be wary of the slick defi- nition which, while seeking to stabilize, in ac- tual fact destroys. All students of Romanticism should heed Braque's timely warning and refrain from allowing tidy definitions of phenomena to replace descriptions of phenomenal experience itself. That we have long had a dim awareness of its essentially fluid and indefinable nature is shown by our constant use in opposition of such phrases as Classical period and Romantic movement, 98</page><page sequence="3">while our frequent need to employ these phrases as a pair indicates a layer of more profound sig- nificance which is not so often probed. For al- though it is true that the work and works of each artist in the Romantic whirlpool must be seen as separate entities, there is a point beyond which separateness and individuality cannot go with- out becoming self-destructive. No man, no work, no tendency is an island in itself. Each is part of a general main even in Romantic times. And paradoxical though it may seem, individu- ality is effective only within the resonance of tradition. The trouble with traditions is, of course, that they may too easily become oppres- sive, and harden into routine-like conventions. Of all possible traditions in the western world, that which is most firmly based on Classical authority is most likely to become tyrannical, for it carries within itself the near-divine impri- matur of the Ancients. It has stood the test of long times past, and may very well be thought to do so for all times to come. This seems to me to have been the fundamen- tal difficulty in France where, far from joining in the biological enthusiasms of nineteenth-cen- tury Germany, both those who ruled and those who were ruled by them clung tenaciously to inherited national authoritarian and even mech- anistic models. Despite the fashions of the day- fashions which stemmed largely from abroad and which did little more than agitate the sur- faces of French artistic life-the old notions con- tinued to offer a degree of certainty in an increas- ingly unsettled world. In the search for order in politics, life, and art, old Reason seemed to vouchsafe a surer way than new enthusiasm, especially in a society as centrally directed as that in France. On a personal level this would seem to have been Berlioz's chief problem, for example. For in him, and to a greater extent than in any of his musical contemporaries, a modern spirit fought courageously with an ancient cast of mind. But because of the force of inherited traditions-his own as well as other people's- his Romantic spirit finally lost out to Classical convention. Even so, it is hard, particularly in the light of present-day experience, to disagree with Val6ry when he says that an artist "can construct in orderly fashion only by means of convention." It seems to me, therefore, that Romanticism needs the framework of conventions drawn up by Clas- sicism if it is to know itself, to profit by that knowledge and then expand. The difficulty, of course, is to adapt, to become sufficiently flexi- ble to make expansion possible. And here the organic models embraced by German artists after Goethe were invaluable. They proved far superior to the mainly mechanistic ones pre- served in France, allowing German music quite literally to evolve throughout the nineteenth century and enabling it to keep in step with con- temporary thinking in the natural sciences. Being inherently flexible, they enabled German composers to emerge from their background rather than position themselves defiantly against it. If there are two single words which encapsu- late the qualitative difference between French and German artists in the Romantic years they are salience and solitariness. Whereas men like Beethoven, Schumann, Brahms, Mahler, and even Schoenberg were salient individuals, able to work within a recognizable but continually developing tradition, those such as Berlioz, the young Hugo, de Vigny and Baudelaire were forced to become solitary egotists. They stood out against the backcloth of conventions which was French artistic life and protested their differ- ence with a vehemence which seems exagger- ated from any other point of view. They acted out their Romanticism on the stage of history publicly, whereas their colleagues from across the Rhine experienced it in private. All of them needed courage, as Stendhal pointed out. But the quality of the risks they severally had to take differed utterly, and was directly related to the distinct national traditions which had nurtured them. With these observations beneath my intel- lectual feet, so to speak, I feel somewhat more secure in offering this essay on one aspect of creative originality at the time. It seeks to clarify the different backgrounds from which individ- ual musicians in Germany and France grew no- table in Romantic times, to examine the aes- thetic and intellectual contexts in which their working lives were set, and so to bring to light those general assumptions which, precisely be- cause they were assumptions, were assumed un- BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 99</page><page sequence="4">19TH CENTURY MUSIC consciously. By doing this it hopes to give a firmer and more rational ground to what, regard- less of degrees of so-called literacy, we all know instantly from personal experience and listen- ing-that German Romantic music sounds quite different from Romantic French; that I For all their common debt to Rousseau and to the times of Sturm und Drang, Romantic atti- tudes in France took on a quite different coloring from those we find in Germany. This was not only because French Romanticism was manifest at a later date than was its German counterpart, but also because of the quite distinct traditions which environed each. The hold over French ar- tistic and intellectual life exerted by Neo-Clas- sical values had achieved its firmest grasp in Tragedie, its musical embodiment in Tragedie lyrique. To a Frenchman music meant first and foremost opera-and French opera at that. From the time of its foundation, when Lully had stud- ied the vocal modulations of the actors at the The6itre frangais, French opera and, by transfer- ence, French music in general, had been con- structed on a literary and declamatory basis rather than a purely musical one. The continu- ing strength of this essentially Baroque tradition throughout the eighteenth century and into the post-Revolutionary years is attested quite clearly by Gr6try's remarks upon the training proper to a composer who wished to write mov- ingly for the human voice. Yes, it is at the Theatre frangais, from the lips of the great actors, that declamation, accompanied by the- atrical illusions, gives us the ineffaceable impressions which the best-analyzed precepts will never replace. It is there that the musician learns to interrogate the passions, to sound the depths of the human heart, to get a clear idea of all the impulses of the soul. It is in that school that he learns to recognize and to repro- duce their true accents, to mark their nuances and their limits.4 The consequent relative importance of the text and music in French opera-a subject whose niceties had occupied the Parisian journals about this difference there is a long-phrased con- sistency which makes apparent mockery of our convenient divisions into periods and styles; and that in this very difference and its overtones lies much of the value, the enjoyment, and the indi- vidual significance of each. throughout the eighteenth century-is revealed by the shape and emphasis of the critical articles it continued to evoke during the nineteenth. As a general rule consideration of the text took prec- edence over any assessment of the score; and this well-trodden formula held good throughout the Romantic years. In the prior position which they accord to the names of the librettists, the follow- ing selected headings, taken from reviews of op- eras produced in Paris during the decade from 1828 to 1837, are typical of the general layout of contemporary criticism.

Nied- ermeyer Journal des DBbats, 5 March 1837 As the critic of the Journal des Dibats wrote on December 9th 1824, after the premibre of Robin des bois at the Oddon, "first we shall concern ourselves with the words and then come on to the music." No wonder that Stendhal, a 100</page><page sequence="5">fervent disciple of the Italian school and of its king, Rossini, should write somewhat sourly: "Who indeed, unless it were a French critic, would dream of judging an opera by the words? "5 That such emphasis upon the nature and the quality of the text reflected a general attitude among the opera-going public also is demon- strated by Boisselot's review of the first perfor- mance of Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini. As he pointed out, it was the freedom and newness of the words rather than the unaccustomed sound of the music-for which in general he had much praise-which most offended public taste, and which had turned the occasion into "a very stormy one": "the public, accustomed to certain forms in the words of an opera, was shocked by the new and free behavior of the libretto.... rightly or wrongly it expressed its discontent over some words and scenes in the literary part of Benvenuto Cellini."6 Another critic, after gently chiding the composer for a certain inci- dence of undeniable eccentricity in his music, concluded his compte rendu by throwing the blame for the general turbulence not onto the composer's shoulders but firmly onto those of his librettists. The real culprits in this matter are the librettists: it is evident that the composer has been forced into many eccentricities by the bizarre and incoherent nature of the poem, by the chaos of the action and the strange- ness of the style .... Isn't there a case here for suing Messrs de Wailly and Barbier for damages with costs on behalf of the composer and the actors? Poetry should stand to music as drawing does to a painting. The most brilliant display of color will not correct faults of composition and of form (my italics).7 These two closing sentences illustrate more clearly than could volumes of extended argu- ment not only the tension between verbal and musical values which was inherent in the Gal- lic-as it is in any other-approach to opera, but also the solution which that nation's particular muse embraced. To distinguish line from color in this way; to relate music first to drawing and then to painting rather than to a much more generalized poetical feeling; to make discrete the "faults of composition and of form," and to consider the text as the fundamental ingredient of an operatic score-all this was to weigh a nine- teenth-century work in the balances of the past. In essence there is nothing at all to choose be- tween Boisselot's concluding observations and Beaumarchais's generalizations upon the desid- erata for good opera which that author had pub- lished in his preface to Tarare some fifty years before. There is too much music in dramatic music. To adopt the crude maxim of the justly celebrated Chevalier Gluck, our opera puzza di musica: it stinks of music. I conclude that music in an opera should be like po- etry-only another means of embellishing speech and one which must not be used to excess.8 A similar conception governed other genres also, and this is implied by the following remark, from an account of a concert given by Liszt and Nourrit at Lyons in 1837. The poet's name pre- cedes that of the composer: Fully to appreciate the pathetic, terrifying, and fan- tastical qualities of the Erlking, one must hear this celebrated ballad by Goethe and Schubert (my ital- ics) performed by Listz (sic) and Adolphe Nourrit.9 As Stendhal again remarked, albeit in another context, such an attitude was characteristic not only of the French school but also of the old school: "Representatives of the old school give all their attention to the words of a song, and none of it to the tune to which those words are sung; the emotional content, for them, lies in the text, and not in the music."' It was the old school, then, which continued to oversee the canons of French musical judgement in the nineteenth century, just as it had done in the eighteenth or, indeed, in the seventeenth centu- ries, from the glorious literary triumphs of which times its mandate initially had sprung. It was not literary academicism alone, how- ever, which conferred such overwhelming im- portance upon the verbal ingredient of vocal mu- sic in France, but a continuing and immanent belief in the potentialities of reason and design, best displayed to date in words. The hallmark of humanity was language, and this distinguished man from all other kinds of creature on the earth. Given both sufficient time and an adequate in- tellectual vocabulary, all problems and in every sphere would show themselves to be but prob- BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 101</page><page sequence="6">19TH CENTURY MUSIC lems of syntax at heart. Either meaning was quantifiable in words or else it was no true mean- ing at all. Thus all questions which could be put could be answered. Conversely, any questions which could not be answered could not be put. No doubt it was this basic assumption which lay behind Gautier's reported opinion that "any man who is baffled by an idea, be it never so subtle and unexpected, is no writer. The inex- pressible does not exist (my italics)."" Such an attitude, so different from that then current in Germany, where music flourished precisely be- cause of the challenge issued to it by the verbally inexpressible, was to have strong and at times even disastrous effects upon all aspects of French musical life in the middle years of the nineteenth century. In accordance with this tradition, purely in- strumental music had provoked general distrust in France throughout the eighteenth century be- cause of its overt divorce from words. Lack of any literary element, and the consequent ten- dency which this lack encouraged for music to pursue a self-sufficient course, was held to "de- humanize" the art and so to render it meaning- less. The necessary verbal connection between music and reason having been undone, the result seemed to be a medium of "ungovernable insta- bility." If it was to be allowed any kind of recog- nition at all, music as such needed a rational model on which to frame itself. Luckily the high ideal of language itself lay to hand. "Melody is made up of sounds, of phrases and of periods, just as poetry and eloquence are made up of words, of phrases and of sentences," observed an anony- mous writer in the Mercure de France in 1813; "consequently it is susceptible of some kind of reasoning.""2 Because it was a rational concept, the pro- motion of poetic and eloquent language as a basic model for instrumental music had inherent qualities which could not fail to recommend it to Gallic sensibilities. In the first place, although it lacked the specificities of any particular words, it was entirely reasonable as a system. In the second, certain attendant subconcepts such as dialogue, declamation, discourse and conver- sation could be extended to cover music without in any way foreshortening their own integrity as rational procedures in art. Thirdly, a musical composition formed along these lines might in- deed be self-supporting, but it never could be wholly self-sufficient. Finally, and with no dam- age to its own integrity as an expressive disci- pline either, any such piece could be interpreted as narrational, dramatic, tragic or even, best of all, theatrical. As a consequence of this peculiar aesthetical casuistry French ears were at last free to enjoy the symphonies of Haydn and Mozart without reserve. Although in the long run these forms were still thought to be less expressive than op- era, their orchestration techniques and general textures might reasonably be described as dia- loguees: and this word, with its overtones of social intercourse and humanized involvement, became a much-used term in French music crit- icism. The peculiar rapport which music was known to create between composer, performer and listener could now be viewed as an extension of the rational, predictable and formal qualities of any verbal language into a broader field of feeling and response. As Lamartine observed in his Cours Familier, music was become "the lit- erature of the heart and of the senses."'3 Even so, Beethoven's instrumental works were still sus- pect to many at first hearing, for they appeared to seek to introduce into France Germanisms which could only be described as dur. In the end, however, even these were "humanized"; and the Journal des Debats could say approvingly on 1 June 1827: The symphonies of Beethoven demonstrate the fusion of all the powers of music. They are animated conver- sations (my italics) in which all the instruments take an active part. ... One enjoys the diversity of accent and character, the admirable artifice with which the contrasts are prepared, and the sense of surprise cre- ated when a motive which one had thought to be exhausted returns in order to play its part in the al- ready rich tableau. The operatic, plastic, literary, visual, and generally reasonable overtones of these remarks are extraordinarily revealing. Exactly ten years later, in 1837, much the same interpretation of Beethoven's orchestral textures was given by Balzac in his strange novel Gambara. His works are especially remarkable by the simplicity of their outline and the way in which this is adhered 102</page><page sequence="7">to. In most composers the instrumentation goes wild and the orchestral effects are designed merely to pro- duce a momentary effect; they do not invariably sus- tain the architecture of the piece by their regular or- dering. But in Beethoven the effects are, as it were, plotted in advance.... This corresponds exactly to the ways of a genius in another genre: in the magnifi- cent historical novels of Walter Scott a character who may seem most extraneous to the action appears at a given moment, for reasons woven into the texture of the plot, and participates in the denouement.'4 The respect for clear simplicity of outline consistently adhered to; for disciplined orches- tral effects which sustain the architectural whole; for ordered pre-vision which allows noth- ing to occur by accident; for what, in other words we may call art-or, if we care to, science-im- presses me profoundly as I read these lines. French attitudes to music seem plotted at a tan- gent to those we find in Germany, where any obvious purity of rational approach tends to be obscured by billowing clouds of mysticism. Nei- ther is a false approach to music, but both are quite distinct from one another, and each creates its own peculiar sound. Clear simplicity of state- ment has always been among the chief ambi- tions of Gallic minds, and clarte was, and is, and will remain a common term in their aesthetical vocabulary for as long as the rational foundation of their thought endures. As Debussy was to write much later in the century, "clarity of expression, precision and concentration of form are qualities peculiar to the French genius."'is5 Although we may not now assent to the chauvin- istic overtones of this remark, we should take its central point to mind as well as to heart. In Germany, on the other hand, music and its relationship with words was viewed in a quite different light. There music was valued sui ge- neris, for its indefinite qualities, for its lack of corporeal firmness, for its ability to move out beyond the confines of verbal concreteness and so to clear a path into the mysterious and bound- less realms of purified experience. Music discloses to man an unknown realm, a world that has nothing in common with the external sensual world that surrounds him, a world in which he leaves behind him all definite feelings to surrender himself to an inexpressible longing.'6 If, for sake of argument, music had to be de- scribed as a language at all, then it had to be as a comprehensive language of the soul. Whereas in France music tuned man to man in social har- mony, to German ears it breathed of the divine, and led each individual soul toward the infinite along a path of personal experience. Music speaks the most universal of languages, that through which the soul finds itself inspired in a free, indefinite manner and yet feels itself at home." Viewed thus, words by comparison with notes were essentially mundane. No matter how powerful might be their impact on the mind or even on the heart, they remained an intellectual projection of men's feelings, an earth-bound alloy compounded in human thoughtfulness. Utterly dependent upon the objects which pro- voked them, words were a kind of public com- promise between objective idea and objectified meaning, and were therefore proportionately less spontaneous, personal, intimate and revel- atory than notes. The musician has a language of feeling independent of all external objects; in verbal language, on the con- trary, the expression of feeling always depends on its connection with the idea.'8 Such being their nature and their origin, words could give but a second hand report upon experience. Mere shadows in the cave of intellec- tion, their failure to slake the German thirst for simultaneity made of them a vehicle for passion far inferior to notes. Speech reckons and names and describes (feeling's) changes in a foreign material ... music streams it out before us as it is in itself. 19 Above all words were external, and thus less than adequate for those whose sensibility was pro- found. A deep temperament seeks ... a higher expression than can be given to it by mere words, proper only to our circumscribed earthly air.20 In music, on the contrary, with its "dark, invisi- ble workmanship," soul could speak to soul di- rect or, even more important perhaps, commune more deeply with itself. BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 103</page><page sequence="8">19TH CENTURY MUSIC In the mirror of tones the human heart learns to know itself.21 In the end even poets and those whose lives were dedicated to the expression of feeling through "mere words" were prepared to admit the priority and thereby the supreme immediacy of music. Moreover, music preceded not only words but also the ideas to which these words gave shape. Thus, because it lay beyond the bounds of rational thought, music came very near to being itself perception. The perception with me is at first without a clear and definite object; this forms itself later. A certain mu- sical mood of mine precedes (my italics), and only after this does the poetical idea follow .. .22 In view of all this it is not surprising to dis- cover that most German Romantics held purely instrumental music in greater veneration than any other genre. In moving away from the ideal of the voice and toward that of the instrument, the nineteenth century parted from its predeces- sors, and Germany grew noticeably separate from France. If it is true that in every art there is a genre which best represents its characteristic essence, then in the case of music that genre would certainly be instrumental music.... in instrumental works music attains its highest significance and is brought to its most perfect development.23 However great the power wielded over them by operas like Der Freischiitz-which, by 1842, had received over two hundred performances in Berlin alone-its source for German musicians lay in the score and not the text. The reign of instrumental genres was now supreme. And, as E. T. A. Hoffmann wrote in his essay on Beetho- ven's instrumental works, to German minds great composers in this medium, composers such as Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven pos- sessed "a more profound, more intimate recog- nition of music's specific nature" than did those who worked with voices. "When we speak of music as an independent art, should we not al- ways restrict our meaning to instrumental mu- sic, which, scorning every aid, every admixture of another art (the art of poetry), gives pure expression to music's specific nature, recogniz- able in this form alone? "24 The exact lineaments of this "specific na- ture," however, remained a mystery defying ac- curate analysis, and emanating from no one knew precisely where. Thus the best approach in words to music was through poetry or raptur- ous metaphor, an approach which gave to music and to the language used by its interpreters a radiant buoyancy both individualistic and di- vine. "0 Music," Jean Paul intoned, "thou who bringest past and future so near our wounds with their flying flames, art thou the evening breeze from this life or the morning air of the life to come? "25 Or, as Robert Schumann put it, less flamboy- antly, "Music is the orphan whose father and mother no one can determine. And it may well be that precisely in this mystery lies the source of its beauty."26 Despite the orphic mystery of its origins, however, all were generally agreed upon its char- acter and earthly function. Music was the es- sence of pure feeling made manifest in notes, and its overlapping waves of sound carried the lis- tener "forward into the spirit-world of the infi- nite." Well might Hoffmann cry out as he heard his ghostly Donna Anna sing to the strains of an aethereal accompaniment: "Open out, oh dis- tant, unknown realms of spirit! Open, miracu- lous land of Djinns, where inexpressible, heav- enly pain, akin to unutterable joy, brings to the enchanted soul raptures beyond all earthly promises!"27 This "beautiful infinite," this "beauty with- out bounds,"'28 was the secret place of Romanti- cism itself. It was to be approached only through a special kind of personal experience, through that "infinite longing which is the essence of Romanticism," 29 and which ultimately music alone-the one true solvent of both Time and Space-could create. The true musician's aim, therefore, whether he were composer, performer or just mere listener, was so to lose himself in the sonorous work at hand that he could "sur- round mankind in luminous, sparkling circles and, enkindling its imagination, its innermost soul ... bear it in rapid flight into the faraway spirit realm of sound."po Two protestations of human love, made by two quite different women, each nurtured in her nation's own distinctive cultural environment, 104</page><page sequence="9">seem to me to sum up the substance of this chapter perfectly. For France, Baudelaire's ficti- tious barrister's wife says to her husband in what the author describes significantly as "a moment of enthusiastic gratitude": "0, Poet! I love you!"3' For Germany, on the other hand, Hen- II "The representation of the Infinite in finite terms"33 had been the definition of Beauty vouchsafed to his hearers by Schelling during a course of lectures on the Philosophy of Art given at Jena during the winter of 1802-03, and re- peated at Wiirzburg some two years later. He had no doubt been thinking primarily of the plastic arts and particularly of Gothic architecture, then coming to be regarded by German Romantics as essentially their own native, national and pecu- liar style. The consecration of Gothic style to Roman- tic sensibilities, and its alliance with burgeoning German nationalism, stemmed from a remark- able essay on Strasbourg Cathedral published by Goethe in 1772, and entitled Von deutscher Bau- kunst. In it Goethe hymns the minster's facade in terms of a biological vitality which, following his example, all critics of the arts in Germany were soon to make the chief source of their own poetic imagery and metaphor. Having likened its multifarious but harmonizing details to those which made up "the trees of God," he extolled the building as it gleamed toward him in the fragrant morning light for its "great harmonious masses alive in their countless tiny details, as in the works of eternal nature, down to the smallest fibre, all form, and all contributing to the whole."34 Some idea of the importance of the insights contained within this slim volume and of their significance and general influence dur- ing the Romantic years can be caught in the echoes they evoked in the course of two articles written more than a generation after its first appearance. "Sebastian Bach's individuality was, in its own strength, intrinsically Romantic and was of true German basis," Carl Maria von Weber wrote in 1818. "His style was one of gran- deur, nobility and power.... A true Gothic ca- rietta Vogel seals her pact of mutual suicide with Heinrich von Kleist in November 1811 with a letter whose first and equally significant phrase is: "O Heinrich, my sweet music ...,"32 No phrases of my own invention could point the difference better. thedral of art was built by his exalted spirit."35 And more than a decade later still, Robert Schu- mann speaking through the mouth of Karl Voigt described his reaction to a performance of the Ninth Symphony by Beethoven in words which seem to betray the direct influence of Von deutscher Baukunst: "I am the blind man who is standing before the Strasbourg Cathedral, who hears its bells but cannot see the entrance."36 Goethe's almost more than metaphorical at- tribution of the characteristics of living tissue to an apparently inanimate and complex Gothic structure was perhaps the first clear and outward manifestation of that belief in the correspon- dence of the immanent laws of Nature and of Art to which he subscribed throughout the rest of his life. Rousseau's call for a return to Nature had concentrated men's thoughts primarily upon her outward show. Now Goethe led them to ponder over the mysteries of her inner work- ings. And music was seen to take its language from within the very heart of natural man and to beholden to no external model whatsoever. As Novalis put it, "The musician takes the essence of his art out of himself-and not the slightest suspicion of imitation can befall him."37 Thus it was that not only Nature, but also the very nature of Nature, came to be under his clos- est scrutiny. Upon examination, however, the apparently simple and untutored whole was found to be the fruit of a multitudinous and vi- brant complexity rivaling in its technical sophis- tication the most minutely detailed works of men. Henceforth the methods of German art were to be inspired by those of this inner Nature. To her organic processes all art-works were re- ferred until what at first had been little more than a highly illuminating metaphor, an appro- priate tool for criticism and philosophy, a clari- BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 105</page><page sequence="10">19TH CENTURY MUSIC fying insight for the poetically inclined and sen- sitive, came to be thought of as the Truth itself. In Professor Abrams's apt words,the regulative had become the constitutive. The deep excite- ment and the sense of numinous wonderment which this insight vouchsafed to contemporary German sensibilities even now irradiates the words through which the young Goethe cele- brated it: "As I have looked upon nature so do I now look upon art.""38 Such a vision was infectious. But for Roman- tics in Germany the vision alone was not enough. For them organicism had to be a teleo- logical experience: it had to have a purpose, and to move toward an end which had been implicit from the start. Herein lies the source of that vein of animism which fed the heart of German Ro- mantic sensibility with a feverish and ever- quickening pulsation. Hence also arose that stream of religious and often specifically Chris- tian feeling which suffused so much contempo- rary writing in the land. From here, finally, stemmed the belief, enunciated by Robert Schu- mann, that the laws of morality and those of Art were identical.39 Thus it became possible to speak of the seed yearning for its bloom; of the acorn striving after its oak; or of the cathedral aspiring toward its God. Moreover, if this sense of "infinite longing"40 were in truth the essence of Romanticism, then the organic or "yearning" methods of Nature were themselves Romantic. Under these terms she could with accuracy be described as "the supreme artist."41 At her feet the human artist, whatever his chosen medium, could sit in a kind of symbiotic pupilship, not in order to trace the lineaments of her seen and outward features, but slowly to comprehend the dark and secret processes through which she rec- onciled discordant elements and made them move in one society. The lessons which Nature taught were those of slow development and growth. For her, Time was a continuum through which to unfold pur- posively-"everything is at the same time means and end"42-and her workings could be discovered as much in the distant past as in the immediate present or the longed-for future. At every passing moment, therefore, the present bound prophecy to history. Despite her multifar- iousness Nature was a unity, a wholeness, a rev- elation of ultimate meaning and significance so overwhelming in its impact on the human spirit that centuries of rational invention were seen to wither at the opening of a rose. She provided not only an ideal to reverence but also-and for mu- sic this was far more important-an example to follow. And here is the crux of the matter. For, in passing through the stage of external imitative- ness (no matter how subtilized or made poetical) and into the very web of Nature's unfolding pro- cesses-a journey which the later and still basi- cally mimetic French Romantics never really completed-Romantics in Germany believed themselves to have discovered not only an infal- lible method whereby what Goethe had once described as "the monstrous chasm"43 separat- ing Nature from Art could be overpassed, but also the secret of Life itself. They had made avail- able to tutored talent that which previously had been the exclusive property of natural genius. Knowledge now could harness instinct to its ends, and investigative scholarship and learning flourished as perhaps they never had before. Moreover the necessary "outside aid"44 to which Goethe had referred in one of his aphorisms was shown to be external only in the most superficial sense. By looking more deeply into that Nature of which he was himself but a significant part, man perceived more clearly the essence of his individual soul. Thus the apparently disparate strands of God, Man, Nature, and Art were woven together into a living symphony of hu- man experience and feeling, and any manifesta- tion of one was thought to be a true though par- tial expression of them all. No art was more susceptible to this mode of thinking than was music, with its intangible progression through the continuum of Time, its universal relevance and affectiveness, and its in- herent capacity for thematic development and general tonal drive. Like Goethe's reaction to Strasbourg Cathedral, Schumann's recognition more than half a century later of the organic character of Beethoven's symphonic music found perfect expression in the metaphor of the giant tree. With this image before him he felt able to make meaningful comment upon the 106</page><page sequence="11">four overtures to Fidelio-Leonore nos. 1, 2, and 3, and that to the opera itself-which he had heard performed consecutively in Leipzig under Mendelssohn's direction. "Such is the great four-overture work. Formed after the manner of Nature we first find in it the roots from which, in the second, the giant trunk arises, stretching its arms right and left, and finally completed by its leafy crown."'45 It can surely be no accident that at almost the same time as Goethe's Von deutscher Baukunst was first published, the sonata principle began to mature and to set out upon its own course of evolution in the so-called Sturm und Drang works of Joseph Haydn. In these prophetic works the emotionalism of the empfindsamer Stil, as seen particularly in the keyboard works of C. P. E. Bach, came to inform the structural re- lationships implicit in the sonata principle and was in its turn disciplined by them. Thus the strands of the additive past were drawn together in the organic present and, through a natural process of evolution, were enabled to move to- ward a bright and promising future. More subtly and more powerfully than was possible in Gothic architecture, or in any other concrete art, every constituent detail in a musical work, every line, chord, and tonal change was seen, heard, but above all felt to be "at the same time means and end."46 "In this," wrote Weber, "lies the great, mysterious secret of music, a secret to be felt but not to be expressed."47 Perhaps unknowingly, at first, Goethe and the increasing number of those who thought like him had taken the one step necessary to confer upon music the then enviable title of "most ro- mantic of all the arts."48 Henceforth music was to be the chief pathway into the mysterious realms of self-knowledge, toward a truer under- standing of the universe and of mankind's situ- ation within it. To each human soul the sounds of music bore messages from the infinite, now made manifest in audible feeling, and dared to name that mercurial essence which even the most poetically-employed words could barely indicate. In man there is a great desire, never fulfilled .... But this desire, to which nothing can give a name, our songs and harmonies name it to the human spirit- the longing spirit then weeps the more vehemently and can control itself no longer and calls amid the music in sobbing rapture: Truly, all that you name, I lack.49 In the words of E. T. A. Hoffmann, once again, music had become "the most romantic of all the arts-one might almost say, the only genuinely romantic one-for its sole subject is the infi- nite."50 If Romanticism in Germany was a special kind of personal feeling best expressed through mu- sic, in France it was more of an individual atti- tude most forcefully outlined in words and often accompanied by gestures. The most potent and remembered outbursts of Romantic truculence in France took place in public-on the stage, in the journals, or through the idiosyncratic ex- ploits of its colourful devotees. When Victor Hugo proclaimed all systems to be false-"Tous les syst mes sont faux; le g6nie seul est vrai"51- his challenge was as much political as artistic, social as much as literary. Rousseau's assertion of his own essential differentness had been tinged with a rebelliousness against the status quo which was not entirely appropriate abroad, where lack of similarly oppressive centraliza- tion allowed some flexibility of thought and ac- tion to individual men. Decades had passed since its initial proclamation, adding to the intensities of Sturm und Drang, had helped to stir the hearts of German thinkers to a closer examination of their selves and a subsequent identification of their internal modes of thought with the se- creted ways of Nature. At home, however, it was different. With each succeeding year in France the hold of traditional values had tightened its grip upon the Gallic muse and preached the gen- eral dangers of too great an emphasis on individ- ual action. The Revolution and the Empire might have simplified behavior in their different ways, but they had in no way freed the creative spirit. Rather had they turned it more directly toward the interests of the State and concen- trated men's minds more narrowly upon its out- ward show and forms. Nothing demonstrates more clearly the strongly rational and traditional elements in the BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 107</page><page sequence="12">19TH CENTURY MUSIC Revolution of 1789 than the terms employed by its apologists in their pronouncements upon the nature and the function of music. Not until the advent of the Russian Soviets are we to hear like things again. At last music has returned to her original purpose-- that of celebrating splendid achievements; of being the principal ornament at our festivals; of giving them a more august and solemn character; of uniting citi- zens to one another by religiously patriotic songs; of arousing sweet and virtuous feelings through the charms of melody; and of making their hearts as har- monious as its own chords.52 The assumption that music was no more than an ornament to be applied to national festivals, and the continued use of decorous eighteenth-century phrases such as "sweet and virtuous feelings," "charms of melody," and "hearts as harmonious as its own chords," betray more tellingly than could any more prosaic def- inition that the immanent assumptions of the time concerning music and its use were those of the past-both recent and remote. The feeling for Antiquity and for the authority which it en- shrined was everywhere, and men drew frequent parallels between themselves and those of an- cient times. Some, such as the leader of the primitifs, when not giving rapt attention to Etruscan vases, walked the streets attired as Agammemnon or his peers. But most were quite content with lesser roles and, according to D6lecluze, women strolled in the public parks "dressed in the Greek manner [and] displayed the grace and beauty of their forms to public admiration," or, if they were men, wrestled na- ked on the banks of the Seine.53 Even as late as 1840 the ethos of Antiquity had not entirely evaporated, and Richard Wagner could report in the Gazette Musicale that he had "once heard a German poet maintain that despite everything the French are the Greeks of our age, and that there is something Athenian about the Parisians since it is they who have the keenest sense of form."54 Unfortunately this sense of form slides easily into codes of formalism; and no time is more open to this shift than is the aftermath of revo- lution. It is one of the drawbacks of all such situations that, once triumphant, revolutions need stability and order to at least as great a degree as did the systems which provoked them. Thus rigidity, censorship, and state control may continue to ordain the paths of thought and art on both sides of the political and social chasm. To the French Revolution, therefore, as to any other, command of the arts and all their media was essential to its own existence; and at the behest of the Committee of Public Safety its history and its achievements were to be en- shrined in verse and song. The Committee of Public Safety summons poets to celebrate the chief events of the Revolution, to com- pose patriotic hymns and poems ... to publicize the heroic actions of the soldiers of Liberty, the coura- geous and devoted characteristics of republicans and the victories carried off by French armies.55 The kind of music which should be used in these celebratory songs was not difficult to name. The reform operas of Gluck had provided an example of affective simplicity which was at one and the same time "natural" and primitif, and replete with moral force. As such it became the ideal stylistic model for composers of the day. A contemporary propagandist puts it em- phatically enough: "In due turn the friends of Liberty will make use of music: it will then em- ploy the manly accents to which Gluck has ac- customed it ... civic songs will teach the people that they have a native land."56 Because of their august and solemn character these patriotic civic songs were most frequently called hymns. Dedicated to concepts such as Liberty, addressed to rational deities like the Su- ?reme Being, or commemorating great days in the Revolutionary calendar, they were a pecu- liarly apt expression of the times and, because of the model upon which they were constructed, of the hallowed national prejudice in music also. According to the same propagandist, "The Rev- olution has created a new genre which we should call hymnlike in order to preserve the august character which it must needs possess. This genre we propose to consecrate exclusively to national music."57s As one would expect, this official sanction- ing of a specific and austerely conceived musical 108</page><page sequence="13">style had considerable implications for the tra- ditionally sensitive area of the relationship be- tween music and words. It was all very well for Bary to rhapsodize over the sisterhood of poetry and music,58 and to exhort the poet to embrace his colleague in mutual love for a higher cause, but Lebrun was still furious at the treatment meted out to his verses by the composers who had chosen-or who had been chosen by Revo- lutionary lot-to set them. "Because it was not susceptible to hymn-like treatment I wrote an Ode on Harvest-home. The whole of my com- position has been mutilated by music andin the interests ofm usic (my italics)."59 Predictably the journals joined in the fray and, in a Revolution- ary setting, produced once more all those argu- ments which had served them so well during the days of the ancien regime. Concerning Lesueur's setting of Esmenard's poem in his Chant du 1er vendemiaire an IX, the editorial board of La De- cade thundered: "He has cut up all the lines upsetting their order to an extent one can scarcely credit. A composer should set verses to music, not break them up, parcel them out and so make bad prose out of them (my italics)."60 With this picture before us it needs no great critical acumen to observe that the old operatic battles had been transferred to the public place and that fundamentally nothing at all had changed. Indeed, through its identification with the highest purposes and functions of music in the centralized State, the concept of Gluckian opera received a considerable boost from these Revolutionary festivals and hymns. By keeping it in the public eye and exalting it to the private mind they helped to make it a vital influence on Berlioz and all later generations of French musi- cians. That the national inclination toward the traditional genre of opera would not be fore- sworn, even in Revolutionary times, is shown by the comments of Ducis, who hoped that his Fete des Epoux might pursue a dual existence-first as an ethical example and a moral stimulus throughout the land and then as an operatic spec- tacle in Paris. Some of my friends believe that with scenery and ballet, with all the appurtenances of a great spectacle, and with music composed by an able man, this hymn might make up a short act and be amenable to produc- tion upon the stage of the Opera. If it were successful it would be both an example and a stimulus through- out the communes of the Republic.61 Throughout all that has been said so far runs a single idle fixe, one to which Ducis made spe- cific reference in the passage quoted above and one which appears again and again in the jour- nalism of the day-and that is spectacle, the general notion of which had always been a gov- erning one in French drama, lyrical or otherwise. The tendency of French intellectuals to sub- sume every facet of life under a few comprehen- sive general notions has already been instanced in their extension of the concept of language to cover the art of music. No concept was more ubiquitous than that of spectacle; and Emile Deschamps's definition of grand opera is as ap- plicable to the great Revolutionary Fetes and subsequent Imperial reviews as it is to La Muette de Portici, to Les Huguenots, or even to Les Troy- ens. "A French Grand Opera is something com- plex and multiple. Fine music needs a good poem which in turn requires effective scenery and beautiful costumes, which in turn demand also a production wherein imagination and accuracy combine."62 Nothing was ever more multiple and com- plex, more full of appropriate music and words, given more effective scenery and costumes or produced with greater imagination and respect for local colour than the Fete de l'Etre Supreme. Le Moniteur described one such festival in its issue for 19 Prairial An 2. "When the men, to- gether with their sons, had sung a verse, all the people repeated the refrain ... after which the women, accompanied by their daughters, sang a second verse."63 The climax to this antiphonal procedure came with the final refrain, and it was performed with resources which perhaps not even a Meyerbeer would have demanded nor a Berlioz been able to control without some diffi- culty. ... the trumpets having given the signal, the crowd with a great upsurge joined its 30,000 voices to those of the musicians and the Delegates against a back- ground of 200 beating drums: and as the formidable discharge of artillery set the echoes flying, it embodied the national vengeance by announcing to Republicans that the glorious day was come.64 BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 109</page><page sequence="14">19TH CENTURY MUSIC It is no wonder, then, that in the end the Revo- lution itself came to be spoken of as a lyric drama conceived on the most spectacular and lavish scale: "The Revolution may perhaps be likened to a great lyric drama with words by Marie- Joseph Ch6nier, music by Gossec, and scenery by David."65 The consistent and continuing operatic style of public life and behavior in France was asserted many years later by one of Sainte-Beuve's for- eign friends. While that great critic was prepar- ing his review of Flaubert's novel Salammb6, this friend was heard to observe: "Have you not noticed that there is always something operatic in everything the French do, even those who pride themselves on realism? The stage effects are there, and also the wings ..."66 Such a re- mark would not have rung true of organic and increasingly symphonic Germany where social, political, and artistic centralization was rela- tively unknown and where official art, in the French sense of this term at least, was almost inconceivable. This basically spectacular approach to mu- sic, in what amounted to a largely operatic social setting, affected not only the general esteem in which the art was held but also the particular way in which its works were put together. Once music generally had been conceived of as a lan- guage, the rational techniques of good dramatic writing might logically be applied to it. Of all such literary doctrines and dramatic techniques none was more important than that of con- trastes, oppositions, combinaisons, et effets; and I do not think it is too much to claim that the deliberate collision of contrasts and opposi- tions, so deployed as to produce amazing effects through startlingly varied and unexpected com- binations, remained the very foundation of Gal- lic music in the nineteenth century. Extended now beyond the operatic milieu to cover all branches of the musical art, and making full use of every subtlety of timbre and nuance which the times had to command, it was among the chief vehicles of musical Romanticism in the land. That at heart it was an operatic and Baroque approach confirms rather than weakens the gen- eral tenor of my argument; for it seems to be one of the chief lessons we learn from history that, although stylistic mannerisms may change, basic techniques do not. Thus in the words of one contemporary critic, the principal charac- teristics of modern music were what they had always been- "to vary its appearance at each passing moment, to conjoin loud with soft, con- tinuous with detached, pompous articulation with tender, all within one piece. Thus consid- ered ... its whole power depends upon rapid transformations."67 Such characteristic contrasts and powerful transitions, such stunningly contrived illusions and expressly calculated gestures, are frequently to be heard in Berlioz's music, and such a com- bination of theatrical effects was noted by Alfred de Vigny in 1837 when he confided his opinion of the Grande Messe des Morts to his Poet's Journal: "The music was beautiful and bizarre, savage, convulsive and full of colour. Berlioz be- gins a harmony and then cuts it in two with unexpected dissonances which he has expressly calculated."68 Three years later Richard Wagner spoke of Auber's La Muette de Portici in a similar vein, finding in its welter of contrasting emo- tions and sounds "a perfect expression of the recent history of the French nation": "Its power to take by storm, its welter of emotions and passions depicted in glowing colors and satu- rated with characteristic melodies, gracious yet powerful, charming yet heroic-is not all this a perfect expression of the recent history of the French nation?"69 When we compare all these sentiments and opinions, these rationalizations and pronounce- ments on music's aims and nature with Mme de Stjiel's assertion that contemporary literature should attempt to "paint heroes with their weaknesses, virtues with indiscretions, com- mon daily events beside the most sublime situ- ations of human life,"70 the parallel is obvious- more immediately obvious, perhaps, than that drawn above between Goethe's biological rhap- sody on Strasbourg Minster and Schumann's poetic interpretation of Beethoven's Ninth Sym- phony. The transference of values and tech- niques from literature to music seems indubita- ble. In the words of Chateaubriand the best modern music created a "pathetic drama" re- gardless of its genre; and when we listen to the 110</page><page sequence="15">orchestral works of Berlioz and recall, perhaps with amused tolerance, that he saw himself as Beethoven's successor in this field, we might do worse than appreciate his position as a French- man before we pronounce upon his possible "de- fects" as a symphonist. BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble III If metaphor in Germany was largely biological, that in France was often decked out in military terms or dramatized in those of elemental force and cataclysm. In Napoleon-or, more accu- rately perhaps, in the idea of that Napoleon who had once described himself as a "volcano" which the Romantic generation formed-an- tique ideals of glory and of heroism were com- bined with those of genius. In the early nine- teenth century the concept of that opera which had dominated France since Lully's time allied itself to Empire and imperial display. The spec- tacles to which they were accustomed on the stage flowed over into life, and Frenchmen found themselves involved in a living drama even more arresting than that of the Revolution itself. I often wonder if the popularity which Shake- speare now enjoyed in France was not, at least in part, encouraged by that poet's consciousness of the stagelike qualities of the world and public life. For every man now had a real part to play, and the scenario provided by the imperial libret- tists exceeded in theatrical effectiveness all pre- vious combinings of contrasted opposites. If the concept of natural organic processes gave Ger- many a path across the monstrous chasm sepa- rating art from life, the notion of imperial society and its pursuit of glory did much the same for France. But however that may be, from the time of Hugo onward the effective legacy of Empire lay in language, and in the state of mind which its imaginative use betrayed. The pride of contem- porary Frenchmen in their imperial heritage is obvious, and finds expression in nearly every- thing they wrote-in their criticism of the arts as well as in their social commentary. In a way it is an updating of the Golden Age syndrome, a gloss upon ideas of noble savageness and child- like innocence: Rousseau "revolutionized" and made imperial, if you will. And just as the con- cept of more generalized genius had fostered the personal intensities of Sturm und Drang in Ger- many, helping to clear a path for full Romanti- cism, so in France Romantic attitudes were bathed in a radiance of remembered glory and culminated in the overwhelming image of Na- poleon. In his peculiar embodiment of genius- made even more compelling, I suspect, by his eventual defeat, exile, and lonely death-Ro- mantic artists discerned not only a vision to in- spire their own conceptions of the hero and his fate at bourgeois hands, but also a symbol through which the elemental pressures in their souls might be both realized and released. This image of the Bonaparte hovers over Romanti- cism in France as an eagle soars above its moun- tain-tops-another figure of speech which fre- quently appears in contemporary literature- and artists felt at one with him in their defiance of mediocrity. What personal experience had been to Germany, this image of daemonic energy now became for France-a spur to set the spirit free from the aesthetic trammels of the past; a spark to set alight the fuse of vengeance on the philistines; an upsurge of explosive power whose aptest metaphor from Nature was "volcano." As Emperor he may have brought disaster on his nation, but as symbol Napoleon gave French Ro- manticism focus. Evidence of his impact on Hugo's "young, stem, vigorous generation"71 is discovered everywhere, from the biographical pages of Sten- dhal who, in 1823, could adequately describe Rossini only in terms of imperial reincarnation, to those of Balzac's novels. He saw even Beetho- ven's orchestral effects "like the disposition of regiments in a plan of battle."72 Napoleon is dead; but a new conqueror has already shown himself to the world; and from Moscow to Naples, from London to Vienna, from Paris to Cal- cutta, his name is constantly on every tongue.73 111</page><page sequence="16">19TH CENTURY MUSIC As for Th6ophile Gautier, his Histoire du Romantisme is alive with similes and meta- phors fired in the crucible of gloire. In his pages young Romantics "rally to the trumpet call of Hernani," "valiantly defend the trenches against the incursions of the Classics" or, imagining Vic- tor Hugo decked out in the accoutrements of Empire, cherish their vision of him as "hand- some, young and smiling, radiating genius and bathing all around him with an overglow of glory."74 The language Berlioz employs in his writings is a culmination of these strands, now suffused with military terms and now mixed character- istically with references to ancient figures and events, shot through with Shakespeare and with images of battle or the sea, and colored with tints of violence, eruption, and display. In Berlioz's spectacular verbal style remembrance of heroic glory is entwined with a consciousness of ele- mental force which, in a combination of typi- cally contrasting adjectives, produces an almost literally shattering effect. Like his music, which operates along similar lines, his prose is typical not only of himself but also of his nation and his times. Thus to his mind his music has caught on with the English "like a match to a powder- train" or, having won great victories abroad, must now "pursue the enemy and not fall asleep at Capua."75 As a conductor he feels himself to be like a general marshalling his forces, while the orchestra itself is imaged as an army in the fullest panoply of war. The expressive power contained within the orchestra, considered as a single instrument, was always in the vanguard of his mind; and when he came to describe this power in his book on orchestration the words he used were of heroic force, Napoleonic in their vision of elemental energy and cataclysm. Its repose would be majestic like the slumber of the ocean; its agitations would recall the tempest of the tropics; its explosions, the outbursts of volcanos; therein would be heard the plaints, the murmurs, the mysterious sounds of primeval forests; the clamors, the prayers, the songs of triumph or of mourning of a people with expansive soul, ardent heart, and fiery passions; its silence would inspire awe by its solemni- ty; and the most intractable constitutions would shudder to behold its crescendo spread roaringly- like a stupendous conflagration.76 As I have suggested at the end of section II, metaphor and even language itself are little more than symptoms of tradition and experience at heart. The absolute need for language which seems inherent in the Gallic sensibility, and which to Berlioz's mind was felt even by music when it wished to be conceptually explicit, is more fundamental than the relative necessity to make a proper use of it as occasion may demand. For the latter indicates a basic commitment to ideals of precision, definition, and exactitude which is not a necessary fellow of the former. It is possible to use verbal languagefaute demieux, as an inferior alternative to music or to any other mode of spiritual expression, to recognize its reasonable limits as well as to rejoice in its po- etical abilities. Roughly speaking, this was the situation in which German Romantics found themselves. They used verbal language when they had to, and in those areas of thought and expression to which it was appropriate. How- ever, the "typically French" attitude, as de- scribed by Delacroix, was different: "Chenavard has the typically French mind which needs ideas which can be expressed in words; when it comes to ideas which language is incapable of describ- ing, he banishes them from the realm of art."77 As a consequence of this need for ideas, words, and concrete images, for what an opera critic in the Journal des Debats once called "known and verified miracles upon the stage,"78 there is a more pronouncedly tangible, tactual, external, and "real" quality about French art in- cluding music-and certainly including the mu- sic of Berlioz--than there is about that of any other western European nation. In every sphere French artists shared a concern for appearances which gave their works an edge their foreign colleagues preferred to blunt. For them appear- ance was nothing less than essence itself made manifest or, bearing in mind their peculiar and esoteric rationalizing of instrumental genres at the turn of the century, essence "humanized" and made acceptable to men. In the words of Charles Baudelaire, "the framework, so to speak, is the most important surety of the mysterious life that informs works of the spirit."79 "Surety" and "framework" are rational and tangible terms, and these words or their equivalents be- 112</page><page sequence="17">came a guarantee of genuineness in art as firm in their appeal to Frenchmen as "organic" was to Germans. And although writers on both sides of the Rhine continued to use "feeling" as their common measure of artistic authenticity, the word as used in France carried a much more sharply focused resonance than that we hear in Germany. It is far more conscious of its tactile roots in Paris than in Heidelberg or Jena, in Leipzig or Berlin. The same applies to "taste"; and not infrequently the columns of French mu- sic criticism drew analogies with food. Art is to musical or poetic ideas as alcohol is to fruits- it conserves them. Clear, warm and strong, such are the qualities of cof- fee: such also are the qualities of good opera.80 This literal-mindedness, this practical ap- proach to problems of creation and presentation in the arts, this need to quantify experience in terms of concrete images and familiar, mundane things and then to judge their value by their feel, their taste, their look, was a direct result of that respect for imperious rationality which seems to be coexistent with the Gallic muse and which, later in the century, would lead artists to describe the real in Realism, fix impressions in Impres- sionism or, finally, take refuge in a wide, chro- matic sensualism. I find it intriguing to observe this line of development by which warm sen- suality is the logical culmination of cool reason; or, to put it rather more obviously, how at the last sense becomes embodied in the senses. It is no accident, therefore, that local color- the bringing together of verifiable characteris- tics of an age or place in sensible ensemble-- should have been described by Constant as "the basis of all truth,"81 and should have formed so important an element in French art during the nineteenth century. Nor was it chance alone which made amassing objets d'art and bric-a- brac (in themselves significant contemporary coinings) so widespread an obsession during the Romantic years. Th6ophile Gautier was but voicing a general sentiment when he proclaimed himself to be a man for whom the visible world existed;82 while the apparently cynical advice "enrichissez-vous," which so dismayed the sen- sitifs, was really no more than a well-timed and well-informed opportunism on the part of Charles X's Prime Minister. He knew his elec- torate as well as Meyerbeer knew his audience, and played upon its prejudices similarly. Here we have come to that parting of the ways which isolated French Romantic artists from the society in which they lived but whose basic ra- tional ideals they, as Frenchmen, ultimately and unfortunately shared. In the make-up of behav- ior nurture is at least as important as nature; and the tension which French Romantic artists felt within their breasts-a tension whose opposing poles were tradition and modernity or, put some- what differently and perhaps a shade more accu- rately, endemic culture and infectious "barba- rism" from abroad-generated that earnest and ironic attitude with which they now were forced to threaten the Establishment, and to which Baudelaire drew attention.83 The truculence we see in French Romantic attitudes is the trucu- lence of those who "kick against the pricks," whose sensibilities may be profound, inclined to metaphor, and open to influences from outside, but whose inherent culture is sharp-faceted, more literal and enclosed. In the "boring" years which followed Waterloo the volcanic forces which had once unleashed the glorious dogs of imperial war and conquest were diverted into frenzied streams of greed, harried ever onward by the rabid hounds of acquisitive commercial- ism. The hero now appeared as entrepreneur, and the sign of modern genius was a calculating op- portunism which found its chief ideals in real things and had no use for miracles in art or thought which were not already known and which had not before been verified upon the stage of life. Thus it was at the material and literal-minded acquisitiveness of this now- grown-inglorious society which Romantic art- ists railed. It was a shallow generation which, in Musset's words, "possessed only a passion for gold, for stock-jobbing, and for eating; with no taste but that for bric-a-brac."84 It was an age whoseidde fixe was commercialism-"the rabid dog which has bitten our infected century," ac- cording to Henri de Latouche."8 It was a society which acquired art as well as "men, ideas and things," and one which therefore made of music BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 113</page><page sequence="18">19TH CENTURY MUSIC a commodity, an object as objective as any objet d'art. With feeling thus degraded into sentiment, and true originality of action replaced by predict- able rearrangements of "known and verified mir- acles" in every sphere, the accepted sign of artis- tic value was popular success, and the only safe musical investment was the work and person of the already known composer. "The best music is that which pleases the public," pronounced the Revue Musicale in 1827: "the administra- tion of the Opera should concern itself only with those whose reputation is made."'86 Based on varieties of personal and largely physiological frisson which were generated by the undeniable realities of "prestigious execu- tion," the framework of a piece was no longer surety of any inner mystery or worth, but only of itself. The value of this framework was intrinsic. Art, like meaning heretofore, must now be quan- tifiable or else be considered as no worthwhile art at all; and those who kept the ledgers were the philistines, the crowd, the bourgeoisie and nouveau riche, for whose use the new term chic was coined, and for whom the ultimate fear was that of being bored. The first condition of theatrical music is to please a public of whom ninety-nine per cent have no knowl- edge whatsoever of the rules of composition. ... it is possible that this is very clever, very beautiful, but this individuality appears to me as strangeness; your rhythm, your dissonances and your part-writing seem to me bizarre. I yawn when I hear them.s7 It was a situation which caused Berlioz to lament in the columns of the Gazette Musicale, and to observe regretfully that the art of his time had been "reduced to the proportions of a greedy speculation"88 dominated by the mob. It was this situation which, finally, had turned Hugo's "young, stern and vigorous generation" into the "earnest, ironical and threatening generation" of Baudelaire.89 The German approach to experience and to art was literally opposite to that adopted by the French. Closely following upon the private rap- tures of their Sturm und Drang, their apprehen- sion of the secret ways of Nature had led away from tangible appearances and into the very heart of things through human feeling. The mys- terious pathway led forever inwards, in Novalis' words;90 and the true reality of all that could be touched, or felt, or heard lay within each individ- ual soul and not out in the world. Ideals were transcendental, not mundane; and even though this inner pathway led directly to mysticism, it would eventually rise up through the clouds to truth. Inward too lay knowledge-not knowl- edge in the superficial sense which words de- scribed, and named, and reckoned out in speech, but knowledge in its fullest sense of universal, absolute, and infinite. Of all the arts music knew this knowledge best, and streamed it out before the listening soul as it was essentially.91 For mu- sicians took the essence of their art from within themselves, and could in no way be accused of imitation.92 Frameworks, thus, in Germany, were of secondary value, the by-products and not the guarantees of substance, and not so much did not any more as could not, now or at any time, act as sureties of inner worth and mystery. This deep distrust of concrete actuality re- vealed itself most clearly in the Germans' atti- tude to statuary which, because of its "sharp, closed outlines," excluded of necessity "every- thing romantic," according to Jean Paul. Signifi- cantly enough in our present comparative con- text, for him even painting could attain full Romantic feeling only when it omitted human figures and turned its eye on landscape, as in Claude. Reverence for human nature, therefore, was but a step toward Romanticism whose es- sence truly lay in natura naturans. A statue, through its sharp, closed outlines, excludes everything romantic; painting begins to approach it more closely through its groups of human figures and, without them, attains it in landscapes, for example in those of Claude.93 The profound liaison between Romanticism and natura naturans which suffused most Ger- man minds is implied in Uhland's words quoted below, and finds musical expression, for exam- ple, in the forested locations of Der Freischiitz or the generally natural environment of the Ring. In Nature also was the seat of holiness and of God, and all the threads of true Romantic feeling 114</page><page sequence="19">came together at the junction of those paths- Heidegger's clearing in a later age-which led forever inward through the forests of the soul. It is not in cold, marble statues, in deaf and mute temples that the God of the Germans lives and breathes, but in the fresh and murmuring forests.94 Because, therefore, artistic nourishment was drawn up plant-like from roots embedded in a ground of personal experience-not gathered in the bloom and slowly filtered downwards-the only possible guarantee of substance was itself. And as so often was the case, Goethe summed up the Germanic view, in the course of a conver- sation with Eckermann on 14 February 1831: "Musical talent may well be the first to show itself, because music is something altogether innate and internal which does not need much nourishment from outside or any experience of life.",95 "Experience of life"-so important to French artists who constantly were called upon by jour- nalists to "live in the midst of commotion and activity,"96 to join the turmoil in the city streets or "reflect ... the emotions of a progressive humanity""97-was not thought necessary to musical creation in Germany. Musicians there needed quiet, not commotion; time to ruminate upon the natural mysteries of their art, not space for frenzied action in the social field; and their art for them did not so much reflect the emotions of humanity at large as embody from the outset the personal feelings of individual artists, ex- press them in their purest forms and point them in their true direction of the infinite. The con- trast between these two conceptions was clearly pointed out by Wagner in 1841, in the columns of the Dresden Abendzeitung: The tendency of the French is directed outwards in a search for common points of contact in extremes. A German prefers to withdraw from social life in order to seek the sources of his inspiration inside himself, whereas the Frenchman looks for inspiration to the remotest reaches of society.98 The concept of reflection, of holding up a mirror to the face of public life and catching in its surface the glitter of dramatic contrasts and events, seems to me quite crucial if we would understand in full and thereby "tolerate," to use Mme de Stall's phrase, the sensible difference between German art and French, and especially between their musics. For it forms the very heart of this inquiry and illuminates more clearly than does any other single term the essential nature of that difference between the sounds of French and German scores which we recognize imme- diately on hearing. According to Mme de Stael, who was a consid- erable musician in her own way as well as being a seminal figure in contemporary French litera- ture, and the chief transmitter of German thought to France, beauty in art should be con- sidered "not as the junction with and imitation of that which Nature herself does better, but as the realized image of that which is conjured up by our souls""99 (my italics). Although this defi- nition shows a departure from traditional theo- ries of imitation in music-theories whereby music was expected to imitate "the tones, ac- cents, sighs and inflections of the voice" as well as "all those sounds by which nature herself expresses her sentiments and passions," to quote the Abbe du Bos'0--it represents no more than a subtilized approach to the principle of mime- sis, not in any way its abandonment. Despite the fact that mimesis now has been internalized, and often is suffused with tearful sentiment, the principle itself has lost none of its old command, as her final phrase reveals. For in this phrase we seem to have outlined a three-fold relationship between a stimulus, a response to that stimulus, and an image of that response. If I understand her rightly, the artist first experiences direct; and then responds to that experience through a men- tal image; and finally realizes the image of that response through all the appropriate disciplines of his particular medium. The art-work, there- fore, should continue to stand at one remove from personal experience, as it always had in "Classical" times, and the artist's initial spon- taneity of feeling must be cautioned by the inter- vention of a realizable image. It is the picture of this image which then finally is offered to the public as the work. The strongly Platonic strain BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 115</page><page sequence="20">19TH CENTURY MUSIC in this is obvious, as is its prophecy of C6zanne's "logical vision"''1 and the consequent birth of Cubism; and the "poetry" of art in nineteenth- century France, a quality to which many con- temporary writers constantly refer, retains an inner consciousness of that word's original meaning. In general, therefore, French artists, as dis- tinct from those in Germany, are still very much the "makers" of things through images, what- ever the medium of their artistry. Even Stendhal, who was by no means an unequivocal admirer of Mme de Stahl's way of writing, seems to be in- fected with the theories she propounds. For it was his "considered opinion" that music could only appeal to the spirit of man "by conjuring up a pattern of imaginative imagery, which in some way corresponds to the passions by which the listener is already swayed."'102 This assessment of the way in which music operates-by reinforcing rather than by gener- ating moods-carried in its last few words an implication of a power to stimulate the memory which led, quite logically, to over-sentimental- ized effusion and nostalgia. "Nothing retraces the past like music,"'03 wrote Mme de Stael, a sentiment which was echoed frequently by many writers of her day and also by those of later times. It is one which displays a view of music's role in life diametrically opposed to that es- poused in Germany. For most Frenchmen music is an awkward art which, because of its "ungov- ernable instability,"'104 must either be subdued by rational criticism at every stage, or else be accepted openly as an element of physical de- light in sensualism. Inferior to Reason and to words, the strong emotive powers of music find their proper place enhancing and supporting "real" things-accompanying the human voice in opera or in song, coloring the background to social activity or to personal feeling, or inducing physical sensations and reactions in the sensi- tive. Effectively, therefore, the concept of music as an agrement- to be applied to national festi- vals in disrupted times, or used as an embellish- ment of speech and feeling generally-survived unscathed in essence into the nineteenth cen- tury. Like mimesis, it had become extended and had grown subtle with the years, but fundamen- tally it had not lost its hold. Mme de Sta6l's view of feeling's ultimate relationship to art was a consistently held thread in the fabric of French theorizing throughout the nineteenth century: and many statements by French artists confirm it. According to Baude- laire, for instance, Les Fleurs du Mal was created in alternating moods of angry inspiration and patient discipline'05--moods which were them- selves a living demonstration of the law of con- trastes, oppositions, combinaisons, et effets- while his awareness of the dangers of what he called "excessive sensibility of heart" (in other words the kind of sensibility which could lead to sentimentalized effusion and nostalgia) were given in the pages of L'Artiste in 1859. ... the feelings that flow from the heart are not nec- essarily propitious to poetic creation. Excessive sen- sibility of heart may even be harmful in this context. Imaginative sensibility is different in nature; it knows how to select, judge, compare, eschew some things, seek out others, all with speed and spontaneity.'06 Val6ry, too, maintained that whoever wanted to write his dream had to be completely awake,107 while Magnard warned that art should never be confused with the feelings, or even the thoughts, which had engendered it.'08 Perhaps Andr6 Gide put it best of all, however, when, echoing ancient views, he asserted that "the most beautiful things are those which madness inspires and reason writes."'09 The ability to se- lect, to judge, to compare, to eschew some things and to seek out others, an ability to which as we have seen Baudelaire attached such great impor- tance, is essentially a rational ability, an overtly critical approach to matters of the feelings and the heart which Stendhal saw as the traditional and therefore the only possible way for French- men to approach the "Temple of the Arts."'11 Gr6try went even further and labelled it an in- stinct: "I followed my instinct which... even in the enjoyment of its pleasures likes to light its way with the torch of reason.''111 I am not, of course, suggesting that German "inwardness"-so often underlined by the sty- listic direction innig in Schumann's songs-pre- vented any critical assessment or reaction on the artist's part during the actualprocess of creation. I am suggesting, however, that the emphasis placed by Germans on music's immediacy, and on the "speed and spontaneity" with which it 116</page><page sequence="21">transmuted feeling into art, altered the balance between the elements of conscious criticism, and inspired creativity in favor of profoundly personal emotion, and could not therefore fail to be audible in their scores. In this context I find it most instructive to compare Mme de Sta6l's view of art with Schu- mann's view of criticism, for the two are not dissimilar and seem to lend considerable support to Stendhal's comment on the essentially ra- tional nature of creative processes in France. For Schumann, "the highest form of criticism is that which reflects most closely the impression made by the stimulating original itself."'12 Here reflection is the critic's charge; and he reacts to his emotional impression of the artistic stimu- lus as Mine de Stael's artist reflected his own mental image of emotional experience. Now I do not wish to press the point too far, for there are subtle differences within this com- parison which defy the power of words to expli- cate. But there is sufficient similarity between them to encourage me to ponder and also, per- haps, to indicate the general area in which the answer to my initial query lies. For although, as I have suggested earlier, art created along the lines adumbrated by Mme de Stael must remain essentially mimetic in the end, it need no longer be so in the strictly naturalistic sense. This relax- ation in the theory of mimesis, this extension of that theory to cover abstract mental images as well as concrete phenomena, helped to confirm the popular position which music was now com- ing to occupy in France's "Temple of the Arts," and to accommodate it thoroughly to Gallic sen- sibilities. Without in any way surrendering to those monstrous apparitions which might issue from the sleep of Reason, music could now be treated as a language of the soul, different in both scale and practice perhaps from that which was used in Germany, but sufficiently influenced by German thought to qualify as Romanticism, at least in part. Modelled still upon the example of human nature and largely eschewing that of na- tura naturans, it bore the standards of traditional French ideals of Reason into the hearts of its nineteenth-century scores. Because Frenchmen generally were interested in the "properties" of the mind, and still found the passions more easy to deploy and countenance in art than all-em- bracing passion itself (which was the German way), the territory of music was able to march with that of economics and commercialism, where the concept of possessing property was all-important and pervasive. By that special kind of casuistry which had first transformed them into elements of language, the elements of music sui generis might now be seen as real proper- ties-to be acquired, arranged, deployed, and dis- ciplined like stocks or shares, like objets d'art and bric-ai-brac, like things. In a society whose general values were as objectified as this, where art was seen as "life addressing life,""3 or where the significantly paired "matters of art and public building" were considered as "the only things which have gen- uine value,"114 it seems altogether reasonable that eventually a composer should attempt to write pieces "in the shape of a pear," or treat music, albeit jokingly, as "furniture" for an ex- hibition-hall.15 The Gallic traditions of titles, programs, and descriptive essays to, for, or in notes, are events which fit appropriately into that frighteningly logical sequence of whose par- allel political and military march the Prussian Chancellor was conscious. The whole tendency of art and thought in nineteenth-century France seems directed outward in the direction of that scientific Impressionism which Gauguin finally dismissed as "a purely superficial art, full of af- fectations and purely material.""16 Even Berlioz, the greatest musician of his race, spoke of la musique in terms of the generation of images, and considered ma musique to be "defaced" when incompetent conductors and performers mishandled the "expressly calculated" contours of his scores. How different is all this from Schumann's view, to whom Weber's instruments in Eu- ryanthe spoke "from the innermost depths" of their hearts,117 and whose advice to young pian- ists approaching his own Album for the Young was to let their music come from out their inner selves, to "feel" it deep within them so that they might make others feel it also."18 The inescapa- ble conclusion to this inward-leading German path was not sound but quietness. And it is not surprising to discover that Schumann himself, the greatest critic of his art and times, who man- aged words with a skill equally as telling perhaps BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 117</page><page sequence="22">19TH CENTURY MUSIC A i ? p p ritard. . . . . SExample 1-" I I I I Example I as that with which he handled notes, should have proclaimed that "the best discourse on music is silence.""9 In this opinion, one in which I think I hear the consummating overtones of Roman- ticism itself, he was but echoing the thoughts of his literary hero Jean Paul who, in his Vorschule der Aesthetik, had observed: Everything in his [Ossian's] poem is music, but it is a distant and hence a doubled music, grown faint in endless space like an echo that enchants, not through its crudely faithful reproduction of a sound, but through its attenuating mitigation of it.120 IV Exactly how is this recurrent tendency of the French to objectify experience made manifest in notes? How does it affect the aural impressions created by their scores? In what particular ele- ment of composition is it truly "realized"? I think it was an English critic who once opined that melody might be regarded as the surface-show of harmony. In our present context this opinion seems most apposite. For looking through the pages of French music criticism, and through those of musically-responsive writers generally, not only is m6lodie a word which fre- quently appears, but also it is one whose expres- sive superiority is presumed almost without question. On reflection it seems logical enough that sensibilities as linguistically inclined as those brought up in France, or otherwise deeply influenced by French thought, should empha- size the linear aspects of experience and so ap- proach their music similarly-that is, through melody. Equally logical is the process by which If there is one passage in all of German music which, beyond all others, "redoubles" its en- chantment by "growing faint in endless space" through the "attenuating mitigation" of its source, surely it is the final phrase of Papillons by Robert Schumann himself (see example 1). In the completely original technique he em- ploys, and in its delicately evaporating sound, the very essence of Romanticism hovers for a moment in the air, and then, as we turn our ears to hear more clearly, fades into a memory, im- mortalized. instrumental melody, because of its presumed original association with words in song, was thought to preserve at least a near-connection with Reason, even when words themselves were absent. But logical or not, French composers from Gr6try to Gounod, from Couperin to Duparc, from Berlioz to Faur6, Poulenc, and Messiaen have given their minds and hearts to drawing out exquisite lines, lines about which there is always a sense of the recherche and of the carefully sought after, of the sensitively considered and the most fastidiously executed. To this all else has been deemed subservient and has become, in a literal as well as in a metaphorical sense, accompaniment. In general, the sentiment must be in the melody; the spirit, the gestures, the expression must be distributed through the accompaniment.'2' Melody alone counts in music.... Melody, always melody... that is the unique secret of our art.'22 118</page><page sequence="23">It was not only composers and musicians who thought thus, however. Philosophers and poets, aestheticians and novelists, critics, essay- ists and the like, all joined in the celebration of melody's superior expressive and emotive powers. Nor is this surprising: for in a land so naturally inclined to literature as France musi- cians had to follow their artistic peers in other disciplines, not lead the way in thought. And whatever formal systems composers might enunciate through prefaces to scores or pro- grams in their works, these rested of necessity upon a firm bed of rational thought laid down initially by litterateurs. For Beethoven's contemporary Chateau- briand, for instance, as for our own contempo- rary Messiaen, the origin of music lay in song and stemmed directly from the sanctified ex- ample of angelic choirs who, presumably, per- formed pure monody. Music as a complex skill, however, as a human concept or an art-espe- cially in its instrumental guise-was deduced by thought and application from intellectual prem- ises alone. It was a child of earth and of earth- bound beings and not the daughter of the skies. As such, therefore, it was by nature inferior to song; and the purest of all earthly music was confined in ancient plainsong chants and simple country airs. The more open-minded Senancour, on the other hand, believed that all the sounds of Na- ture gelled into one great singing line, and looked forward eagerly to the day when the art of human music, old as well as new, would at last be lost to hearing in the multifarious reverberations of natural sound. Until that day came, however, the simplest tunes were best: for complex harmony and intense intellectual effort-whether on the part of the composer or on that of the listener-- seemed to defeat all expressive spontaneity and emotive force. "I very much enjoy two or more voices in unison; the melody retains all its power and simplicity," wrote Senancour. "As for clever harmony, its delights are foreign to me. Knowing nothing about music I fail to enjoy that part of it which is little more than art or problem."'123 For the eternally childlike Alfred de Musset, melody gave wings to words. As an art-and here he followed Chateaubriand-music might be likened to the processes of pure thought, an opin- ion which Chopin partly shared and one which he relayed to Delacroix in the course of a conver- sation not long before his death.124 But the sim- ple feelings of the heart, those feelings which were the essence of Romanticism in France, were best communicated through unsophisti- cated melodic lines. These, seizing upon the very essence of sentiment itself, brought with them intimations of immortality and echoes of infi- nitely distant worlds. "Melody seizes upon feel- ing and isolates it; whether it concentrates feel- ing or deploys it, melody draws out its supreme accent."'25 At one time in his life G6rard de Nerval, brought up partly on the popular songs which his father used to sing, seemed prepared to exchange all the artful complexities of Rossini, Mozart, and Weber for one such simple air: Il est un air pour qui je donnerais Tout Rossini, tout Mozart, tout Weber Un air tres vieux, languissant et funebre, Qui pour moi seul a des charmes secrets.'26 In later years he concentrated upon the vocal inflections of strange southern tongues, and saw in the thematic physiognomy of Liszt's Prome- theus a successful solution to the formidable challenges of that composer's expressive and for- mal problems. Listz [sic] in taking on this task has tried to overcome a difficulty of the fiercest sort. He needed to discover a musical style appropriate to so strange an undertak- ing for which there was, so to speak, neither prepared soil nor established framework. He had to achieve an ordered unity in the midst of a great diversity of mo- tives, without in any way cutting himself off from old- style majesty and flexibility; to give movement and passion to symbolic characters; to give life and body to abstract ideas; to formulate, in addition, deep and violent passions without the interest which is always aroused by a succession of [dramatic] events. By the striking beauty and the undeniable attractiveness of his melodies he has escaped the conflicting dangers of his task ... (my italics).'27 To the brothers Deschamps Chopin was not the supreme harmonist of his day, as Anglo- Saxon critics are wont to see him now, but the "king of melody," whose powerful art had awoken feeling in the virgin heart of childhood "before another kind of love could heat the blood."'28 When discussing Chopin's manner of BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 119</page><page sequence="24">19TH CENTURY MUSIC composition and performance, therefore, it was upon the peculiarly personal singing and me- lodic quality of his art that Emil focused his attention: "[Chopin] electrified his audience by the originality and the coloring of his style, by the freshness of those melodies which he alone can play upon his instrument, by his ingenious grace and his exquisite freshness."'29 For Theophile Gautier, so catholic and yet so inconsistent in his tastes, the power of Italian opera could always overcome the more theatri- cal attractions of even so stagey and Gallicized a composer as Meyerbeer. And it could do so be- cause "despite her carelessness, her facile ba- nality, her repetitiveness, her tendency to ex- travagant improvization, Italy will be for a long time to come the queen of melody as she is of painting"'13 (my italics). As he pointed out later in the same review, "thought is good but passion is better," for one "comes with application and the other stems from God." In his ears, as in those of his fellow-countrymen, passion's metier, the metier of that which came from God, was mel- ody. All other elements in a musical score, par- ticularly those which, like harmony, involved great thought and application, were little more than artful monuments raised by human clever- ness. They lacked the spontaneity and the fresh- ness of true sentiment directly realized in line. Even Berlioz's great contemporary and ac- quaintance, Honor6 de Balzac, who had such a taste for music and who submitted himself so willingly to Strunz's teaching before he wrote his music-centered novels Gambara and Massi- milla Doni, found in vocal roulade and melodic ornament "the highest expression of the art of music." For him the vocal melisma and melodic ornament was "the only point remaining to the friends of pure music, to the lovers of naked art."131 Thus did vocal and musical virtuosity join hands with bourgeois realism and find, in the brittle and salient brilliances of melodic lines superbly etched and executed, a perfect bridge between their society and art. It is only logical that concentration upon me- lodic line should have brought in its train not just a lack of emphasis upon other elements in the art of composition, but also a strong distrust of them. The chief recipient of this distrust was harmony. Because of its vertical aspect and in- herent density, its long-range influence over de- velopment and form, and its seemingly neces- sary connection with tonal procedures which were best deployed through instrumental and symphonic fields, harmony was thought both to complicate the musical experience per se and to undermine its expressive power and emotive force. Harmonic thought deprived melody of lin- ear and expressive freedom, making rigid with convention what should have been as pliable as instinct itself. It replaced sentiment with thought, and spontaneity with calculation, while for Gallic charm it substituted a Germanic ponderousness which could only be described as dur. It was altogether too prejudicial, too pe- dantic, and too scientific for that pleasing gra- ciousness of effect which even so expert and finely chiselled a composer as Debussy was later to claim as the constant and humble aim of music. 132 In the first quarter of the nineteenth century no one was stronger in his aversion to the com- plexities of harmony, and to the opportunities it afforded for foolish pedantry to run riot in sound, than Stendhal. "Harmony requires scientific knowledge. This requirement in itself has proved fatal, for it has provided a heaven-sent excuse for all manner of fools and pedants to meddle in the art of music."133 The strength of this aversion can be assessed by the fact that not even his own hero, Rossini, was exempt from censure when his biographer felt that he had strayed too far from the path of melodic simplic- ity and textural clarity. As he saw it, Rossini had led his generally clear-cut and exquisite art into what could only be described as a "harsh wilder- ness" by plunging "deeper and deeper into Ger- man-style harmony." 134 The very words which Stendhal uses in this condemnation unwittingly betray his distrust of "depth" in the German sense of the term. Conversely, they imply a pref- erence for surfaces, a recognition of the impor- tance of artistic frameworks which, in a musical score, are most clearly to be realized and heard in melody. The pivotal figure in this essentially Franco- German conflict was Mme de Stael. Although she was friendly with many German artists and 120</page><page sequence="25">became the chief transmitter of their sensibili- ties into France, the cast of her mind was senti- mental rather than profound, while her profes- sional interests were literary and not musical. In music she was hardly more than a gifted ama- teur, a status frequently confirmed in her novels by the behavior of their heroines. These pale and failing ladies use music as accompaniment to an emotional self-indulgence and abuse which stronger spirits such as Stendhal found both dis- tasteful and embarrassing. In Mme de Sta6l's own hands, as in those of her fictional characters, music became very much of a background art, an efficacious rune through which to conjure up nostalgia, a sweet solution of sonority in which to bathe the diaphanous images emanating from her fanciful and frequently weeping soul. Music created a subtle and pervasive atmosphere which, because it was emotionally self-indul- gent rather than imaginatively re-creative, re- moved from everyone all need for "scientific knowledge" or for "too much thought."135 The one essential element, and one which could be cultivated by all, was "heart." For in Romanti- cized France, and especially in its attitude to music, mind was heart and heart was all, as Sen- ancour observed. Of all the arts music was quite literally the most heartfelt. And of all its elements the one which seized most obviously upon the feeling heart was melody. Thus, despite her German sympathies and interests, Mme de Sta6l was more deeply moved by simple tunes than she was by what she called "ingenious combina- tions" of notes in harmony.136 Wherever she went in her years of exile it was tunes like those sung by Venetian gondoliers, or airs such as were piped to her by Bohemian shepherd-boys that gave her the keenest pleasure. Although, and somewhat grudgingly, she would occasionally admit the possible emotive powers of chordal combinations, the quintessence of musical feel- ing remained concentrated in melodic line. Through the affective powers of sinuous melody hearts reached out to hearts spontaneously with- out the need to "ruminate too deeply" on what they did, or "give too much thought" to exactly how they did it. This concern on the part of artists and intel- lectuals generally for the clarity, simplicity, and nakedness of melodic line found open support in the numerous comptes rendus which appeared almost daily in the Parisian press. It was not only the power of melody itself, however, which oc- cupied the attention of the critics, but the rela- tionship which they believed ought to obtain between it and its musical backing, between the vocal line or the instrumental melody and what even the greatest among them continued to call the accompaniment. In its account of the first performance of Mozart's Don Juan, for instance, published on 19 September 1805, the Journal des Debats described the difference between French and German musical tastes and practices in terms of a conflict between orchestral accom- paniment and vocal melody which it believed to exist within Mozart's work. If Germany has given us the music of this drama, France has furnished it with the subject and its prin- cipal situations; but the Germans have spoiled our Moliere; let us hope that they will not accuse us of having spoiled their Mozart! In the pathetic sections the broad harmonic traits have been little appreciated generally; the light, gracious and playful airs, the small duets and cavatinas have charmed everyone. Is it the fault of the actors or of the public, or may it not be even that of the composer himself if that part of the music which ought to have been the most admirable has been the least admired? I believe that above all else one must lay the blame on the great density of the accompaniments which crush the melodic line and which overpower even Mme Armand's voice. We have too little knowledge- or rather we have too much taste-to put up with this complication of parts. We like what is simple, natural, and song-like, and all that is truly good and beautiful in music. Instrumental progress has been fatal to mel- ody, and our orchestras kill our operas. Some believe that this plethora of harmony nourishes and fortifies musical compositions: on the contrary, it drives them berserk with a vain bombast which is worse than feebleness. Perhaps the virtuosi who make up our Op6ra orchestra (without doubt the first in Europe) could obviate this grave shortcoming by using all their skill in making themselves as little heard as possible. I know of no other paragraphs in contemporary criticism which encapsulate so neatly the per- ennial ideals of French musicians-traditional even in Romantic times: nor of any which illu- minate more clearly the deep distrust of har- mony and instruments endemic to the Gallic muse. 121 BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble</page><page sequence="26">19TH CENTURY MUSIC Despite his orchestral brilliance and despite also the large instrumental forces which he de- manded in his works, even Meyerbeer was praised by the critic of Le Moniteur Universel for making his orchestra play discreetly and for not allowing it to overpower the vocal line. "His style is distinguished by simplicity, verve and strength. In him the expression of ideas is never suffocated beneath a frivolous luxuriousness. In the accompaniments his orchestra sings with discretion, if you will pardon the phrase: it is the only one which seems fully to convey my mean- ing." 37 And it was the apparent lack of just this kind of orchestral discretion on Beethoven's part which led Henri Blaze de Bury to describe even so great a work as Fidelio as "no more than an instrumental work, an imposing and moving symphony which treats the human voices as extra instruments, in which tenor, soprano, bass and baritone play the part of oboe, clarinet, trom- bone and ophecleide, in a tumultuous whirlpool of the most formidable orchestra without ever being able to lift themselves free or float easily above it."138 What Beethoven appeared to lack, however, Rossini possessed in more than sufficient meas- ure. The whole of Rossini's considerable repu- tation in France was based upon his ability to subordinate orchestral accompaniment to vocal melody, and so to juggle the various ingredients of the operatic genre that the clarity and apparent simplicity of the whole were never sacrificed to a fundamentally German-style harmonic heav- iness. According to most French critics of the day this last had been the one great flaw in Mozart's operas; and since his death, and largely because of the unfortunate influence of Beetho- ven's symphonic music, orchestral writing had threatened to overwhelm the whole balance of voice and orchestra in both the composition and the performance of operas. That state of musical art at the time of Rossini's ap- pearance can be outlined in a few words. The Italian school, always subservient to melody, displayed but a slightly complex harmony in either its vocal or its instrumental sections. For its part the German school continued to sacrifice vocal melody to orchestral combinations and to a harmonic predominance which, since the time of Mozart's compositions, has taken fresh wing. It is not that this great composer neglected melodic design, but rather that he rarely conditioned it to the natural instrument for which a lyric composer ought always to write, to that organ to which nothing can compare-the human voice. De- spite all the respect and admiration which this cele- brated German composer inspires, one must admit that in his works he rarely maintained that indispen- sable distinction between vocal and instrumental melody. 139 According to our author a new dawn had bro- ken upon the world of music with Rossini's ap- pearance upon the scene. Never for a moment abandoning the true aim of all the arts, which still was "to increase the sum of earthly happi- ness and joy,"140 Rossini outshone all his prede- cessors. In his works melody reigned supreme, even when it was shared out among the most unlikely instruments of the orchestra in the manner of a human conversation. Significantly, his very modulations were dictated by the con- tours of the vocal lines, upon which they threw new and meaningful light. Although he had ex- tended the gambit of the orchestral parts even beyond those trodden by his German predeces- sors, he had done it primarily through the me- dium of melody, and so had guaranteed for ever the translucent excellence of his scores: "from his orchestra he created a world wherein diver- sity was subject to unity ... and, where others would have created chaos, he gave the rule to melody which seized hold of the most unlikely instruments and clearly communicated itself to the listener.'141 Even Schubert's lieder which, significantly for us in the present context, were designated melodies by the critics of the day, were judged in general by the standards of behavior expected from the Gallic muse. Writing in the Revue et Gazette Musicale on 15 January 1837, Ernest Legouv6 was forced to point out that despite his manifold genius, of which he, the author, stood in awe, Schubert also had his faults, the chief of which appeared to be melodic instability. His melodic phrase is sometimes so vague that one cannot get hold of it, or so capricious that it shines like a ray which vanishes instantly so that one cannot tell whence it came or whither it went. I would re- proach him also for his love of the unexpected, which 122</page><page sequence="27">employs over-brusque modulations in such a way that the melody is wholly broken up like a bird whose wing has snapped. In this passage Legouve leaves the reader in no doubt that, for him, the superior element in a song is the vocal line, the melody, and that any "over-brusque" modulation which drew atten- tion away from this and threw it onto the accom- paniment was reprehensible, even if it had been conceived by genius. Two years previously the arch-critic F6tis had said much the same thing when writing of Schu- bert's Die Junge Nonne. What mattered to him was neither the expressiveness of the whole- indeed, his closing remarks seem to imply a cer- tain reserve about expressiveness in general- nor the poetic and organic unity of the song, but the dominating contour of the vocal line. He resented the equal partnership between singer and keyboard (which he termed the "orchestra") and which was so fundamental a characteristic of the mature German lied. It is certainly not without merit; however, its weakest feature seems to me to be its melody. All the compos- er's attention is focused on the portrayal of the storm by the orchestra, and the voice appears only as a sort of recitative with little effectiveness. A songlike phrase that ends each strophe of the romance is prac- tically the sole melody to be found, and even this phrase is more remarkable for its expressiveness than for the novelty of its form.'42 F6tis's nomination of Schubert's lied as a romance betrays an inability to escape from those tradition-rooted canons of classification, judgement, and evaluation which he exhibited continually throughout his career. The French romance was frequently melodie at its lowest level of attainment, and could in no way be con- sidered comparable with the German lied. As a genre it achieved the height of its success during the final years of the Restoration, and through- out the subsequent reign of Louis-Philippe. Everyone sang romances and almost everyone seemed to write them~-to the consternation of the Gazette Musicale which, on 21 February 1839, attacked the "mania" for composition which appeared to have overtaken the town. This denunciation was but a reflection of Berli- oz's cri de coeur of the previous year when he had complained in characteristic terms of the flood of musical rubbish which was then overwhelm- ing the Parisian scene. Never, it seems to me, has Paris been so occupied with music; never, in consequence, has the task of the unfortunate critic seemed so arduous, so tiring, so difficult, so discouraging, so detestable, nor more stu- pid and useless. It rains albums, an avalanche of ro- mances, a torrent of varied airs, a cataclysm of fanta- sies, a waterspout of concertos, cavatinas, dramatic scenes, duos comiques, classic sonatas and romantic rondos, fantasies frenetic, fanatical and fluoridic (I refer to the corrosive chemical) ... There is too much to do; it is all superficial.'43 In its turn this echoed the words of a writer in L'Artiste who, some six years previously, had complained that each year over-active musi- cians launched upon the world "an elegant or graceful album of romances" which, for the rest of the twelve-month period, "caused the echoes to fly in our salons."'44 In all of these ephemeral compositions, so different in origin, in method, in intention and design from the contemporaneous German lied, the emphasis lay upon the affective power of the vocal line in which, as Reicha had observed, the sentiment of music's language lay enshrined.'45 However dramatic or poignant might be the key- board ingredient of a romance, however sombre might be the drama conjured up by its "tempes- tuous murmurings," whatever technical chal- lenges it might issue to the performer, and de- spite the quasi-orchestral figurations which it frequently employed, the accompaniment oc- cupied a position in the general hierarchy of both composition and performance wholly subordi- nate to that of the "simple melody" above. At the most its purpose was illustrative-which il- lustration could be either literal or emotional according to the nature of the words and the bent of the particular composer. Through it, and in accordance with the well-known views of Gr6- try, the spirit, the gestures and the general emo- tional chiaroscuro of the texts were to be distrib- uted and relayed. It was, in other words, an accompaniment in the strictest possible sense of that term, one background element in a gener- ally theatrical ensemble which achieved its BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 123</page><page sequence="28">19TH CENTURY MUSIC most arresting effects through the combination of varied contrasts and oppositions. And as with all French music, almost regard- less of its genre, the fundamental guidelines were laid down by the conventions of verbal prosody, while the overall manner in which the music should be sung was that of impassioned declamation on the stage. Whatever the words, the tune should wholly identify itself with them: their proper declamation must determine the melody and the composer should use all his talent in following them exclusively whilst bearing in mind the subject, the expression and the prosody. 146 The effect upon French music-making generally of this concentration on melodic lines has been both crucial and manifold. In the first place, and regardless of historical period, the principle of ornamentation has become an integral and not a superficial element in its works. This becomes apparent immediately one performs a section of any ordre by Couperin, for instance, and per- forms it "straight." To omit the mordents, turns, and trills in Bach leaves the substance of his musical thought relatively untouched. But to treat the clavicinistes likewise does irreparable harm to the very nature of their work. With later works as well, works in which the ornamenting principle has become thoroughly assimilated into the written line, the decorative inflections of any composer's melodies-terms which are pejorative only in a German-based vocabulary- cannot be separated out from the "real" tune by any but the most myopic of confined and cabined critics. We may say, therefore, that at every pe- riod of its history the spirit of ornamentation is necessary to French music and not optional. Without it their compositions would lose all sense of authenticity and artistic rightness, all feeling of individuality and sense of contact with their Gallic heritage. In other words, all value and delightfulness. As a result French style, even in Romantic works, demands from the performer, and from the listener too, a standard of professional skill and critical judgement which exceeds that re- quired by any other style in westernm Europe. I say western Europe here advisedly: for there obtains between the subtle linear and rhythmic inflec- tions of most French music and that of eastern Europe, a general likeness which can only ade- quately be spoken of in terms of family resem- blances. It is not surprising that so many refugees from eastern lands should finally have been dom- iciled in France. Apart from any obvious political or social sympathies which might have existed between them and their adopted home, deeper forces were at work, forces which prepared the way for Diaghilev and his Ballets Russes, and which helped to turn Debussy's ear apprecia- tively toward the timbres and patterns of the Orient. There was throughout the nineteenth century a noticeable eastward inclination in the French, one which helped to form a bastion of like-minded spirits against the threat from Ger- many, and one which was manifest in many dif- ferent fields. But whether it took a form political, imperialist, or artistic, its roots lay in a common taste for patterning which, in music, was most easily expressed through the linear and formal refinements of rhythmically vital melody. The specific coloring of these melodies was also crucial to French composers, and this ac- counts for that finesse of timbre and nuance which has for so long been a distinctive charac- teristic of their scores. The craft of instrumen- tation goes hand in hand with that of melody, and it is no accident that men like Berlioz (or Rimsky-Korsakov in pattern-loving Russia) should have published treatises on the subject, nor that most German composers, except Ger- man opera composers, should have appeared less immediately concerned with it. In the second place, such a refined melodic art must of necessity affect its accompanying harmony. And if, as Anglo-Saxon critics often state, French composers seem to harmonize downward from melodic lines rather than up- ward from their basses, it is only to be expected that the resultant chordal sequences should sometimes embarrass and even outrage the tra- ditional German academic harmonist, who works the other way. The freedom of melodic movement which French musicians fought so valiantly to maintain in a period of harmonic dominance injected into the bloodstream of their chordal thinking an analogous fluidity 124</page><page sequence="29">which made prediction near-impossible. More- over, it promoted a search for illustrative har- monic piquancy in an instrumental context which bore more than a casual affinity with the art of affective word setting characteristic of late Renaissance and Baroque madrigals. Contrary to their German colleagues, French composers spotlighted the saucy attitudes of harmonic de- tail and left the less spectacular movements of tonal purposes in the shade. At best this illumi- nated their melodies and idles fixes with nu- ances of coloring which can only be compared with Monet's views of Rouen minster under many changing lights. At worst it produced such a wayward-seeming combination of harmonic contrasts and chordal oppositions that the over- all effect was one of sheer vulgarity often under- lined by noise. The cult of circuses and simu- lated eruptions of Vesuvius, of low-grade farce and garishly colored clubs which formed so prominent a part of Paris nightlife throughout the nineteenth century, found its musical equiv- alent in the multicolored scores of Meyerbeer, or in the sham oriental lushness of F6licien David. If, paradoxically, we seem to hear more of "art" and artifice in France than in Romantic Germany, and find this difficult to reconcile with the flood of musical rubbish which caused Berlioz such despair, it is because the best French composers recognized the depths of that vulgar- ity into which the cult of Romantic feeling might seduce them, and knew the ease with which theatrical effectiveness could tumble over into slapstick comedy or farce. In reaction technical skill and professional nicety assumed a place of paramount importance in their aes- thetic reasoning, and produced in both their work and attitude an aristocratic and Byronic distaste for the obvious which threw up a barri- cade against the onslaughts of the mob. In the Romantic years, therefore, as in the centuries which had preceded them, the best French music was exclusive-a point which Berlioz never ceased to labor in his writings-and made de- mands upon the listener as well as the performer which only a selected few were able to fulfill. In the words of Th6ophile Gautier, music was a "hieroglyphic art," one which was not to be understood without considerable effort and one which, above all else, refused to descend to the level of the crowd.147 The tension in this situation is obvious. For no matter how Romanticized their sensibilities might become, and regardless of their inner urge to admit "barbaric" influences from abroad, the true French artists of the day had to conserve tradition as well as overturn convention, resist the mob as well as attack the Establishment and, finally, to denounce the present while execrating the immediate past. In their spirits the standard canons of their great Classical heritage fought tenaciously to maintain hegemony over the col- orful banners of Romantic infiltration. And, in the end, these won; but only at considerable cost, and only with ineffaceable effects upon their scores. In the third place, and consequent upon the other two, French approaches to musical form were necessarily different from those we find in Germany. With melody subservient to notions of prosody, and harmony colorfully illuminating linear shapes, French formal procedures were less organic and more repetitive than those in lands where the sonata principle held sway. It seems to be a fact of music history that, where melody rules, extension rather than develop- ment is the formal norm. Repetition, transposi- tion, and reharmonization now become the basic procedures, and these are sharpened up in sophisticated hands to yield all manner of rhythmic subtleties and linear transformations. All praise therefore to Liszt-in essence a wholly Francophile composer-for developing the no- tion of the symphonic poem and for providing, in his technique of thematic metamorphosis, French and other non-Germanic composers with a working alternative to the symphony. Words are often stronger and more powerful than even the wisest may appreciate; and, after Beet- hoven, the very thought of "symphony" struck terror in musicians' hearts. This was nowhere more so than in France. Whenever men like Ber- lioz or Gounod sat down to write a symphony the strains inherent in the undertaking were ob- vious for all to hear. It was not that they could not do it, but that they could not do it in the German way. Not, that is, unless they were content to plagiarize. And BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 125</page><page sequence="30">19TH CENTURY MUSIC even then the results were often hybrid and sat uncomfortably upon the listener's ear. Gounod's Symphony in Eb provides an excellent example of this mongrel type: for only when it settles unashamedly for a native ballet-music style-as in the second subject of the first movement, for instance-or follows the example of Mendels- sohn's delicately evocative pictorialism, can it take its ease and let us take ours too. The five- movement mold in which several of these sym- phonies or extended works are cast-the Sym- phonie fantastique is an excellent example here-can perhaps best be viewed as a reflection of the five-act form of tragedie, a subtle proof of French music's continuing dependence on the word. And the programmatic details, which translate so uncomfortably into sound, mirror those colorful tableaux on the stage for which V While even the greatest and most renowned of French musicians were thus entranced by mel- ody and by the expressive possibilities of line, German composers became immersed in har- mony-and not in the narrow sense alone. To them the concept of harmony was as much a matter of extended formal relationships as it was of immediate chordal combinations. And the control of evolving masses rather than the sculpting of plastic lines became the chief preoc- cupation of their days. It was this feeling for overall harmonious re- lationships which, in 1835, led Schumann to observe that "In music everything is dependent upon the relationship of the individual part to the whole. This applies to the individual com- position, whether large or small."'148 And it was his own deep consciousness of the rapport exist- ing between the laws of art and those of morality which caused him immediately to add "and this applies also to the artist's whole life." As Flores- tan observed in his Journal of Poetry and Thought, "I do not love the men whose lives are not in harmony with their works."'49 This suf- fusion of art with a religious-based or even secu- lar moral atmosphere is one of the strongest the French theater was notorious. There is no doubt that even in orchestral and instrumental works, opera and not symphony was the French composer's guiding star, and that whatever he wrote, his aim remained immediate effective- ness rather than eventual truth. In other words he preferred theater over drama. Perhaps we should not expect to be as pro- foundly stirred by Berlioz as we are by Brahms, nor attempt to glean from Gounod's Sapho the kind of cosmic parable we may deduce from Wag- ner's Ring. But who is to say that we shall obtain a less true insight into the mysteries of experi- ence and life from Messiaen's Catalogue des Oiseaux than from Schumann's Second Sym- phony, or derive a smaller degree of spiritual uplift from the delicate ironies of Satie than we may from the searing agonies of Mahler? characteristics of German art from early times to the present day, and helps to distinguish it clearly from art produced in France, where aes- thetic theory appears securely grounded in be- havior, and for which the word "ethical" seems to be an apt description. With the example of Goethe before them, German thinkers and aestheticians of the nine- teenth century were consumed with the idea of natural, organic form, and rejected all other schemes as mechanical and in some way, there- fore, as ungenuine. Form is mechanical when it is imparted to any mate- rial through an external force, merely as an accidental addition, without reference to its character.... Or- ganic form, on the contrary, is innate; it unfolds itself from within, and reaches its determination simulta- neously with the fullest development of the seed.... In the fine arts, just as in the province of nature-the supreme artist-all genuine forms are organic (my italics).s50 As a consequence of this mode of thinking they became increasingly unable to divorce art from inner life, the essence of which for them was best expressed through music. This compul- sion to be organic in method and moral in pur- 126</page><page sequence="31">pose led composers generally to prefer tonal ar- gument to melodic assertion, mass to line, and thematic development to any kind of melodic variation or subtlety of accompaniment. Indeed, the very idea of accompaniment as such (so prominent in the thinking of the French) seems rarely to have crossed their minds: for they spoke always in terms of equally-balanced relation- ships-tonal, formal, harmonic or textural. To them deployment of keys suggested a formal scheme, any chord implied a possible context within that scheme, and variety of texturing foretold all kinds of structural interplay. Even those dramatic contrasts which, in French hands, created additive ensemble of the most theatrically effective kind, were seen by them from an organic point of view. Nothing was val- ued for itself alone, but solely for its contribution to the whole. The greatest effects and beauties proceed solely from the manner of their disposition and combination; de- tached from their context, they nearly always lose their whole character, often, indeed, bearing witness seemingly against themselves in that, thus considered apart, they become well-nigh meaningless. Only very rarely can even the liveliest description make fully intelligible their true, organically connected coexist- ence with the remainder.'51 If you look at it properly, you will see that this colossal work is based on a foundation of deep and definite thought, the development of which makes every bar a necessity, whether beautiful or in itself ugly, con- nected or disconnected, conceivable or, in itself, in- conceivable and only to be understood by the con- text. 152 Seeking harmonious and organic unity rather than effective ensemble, therefore, they found their perfect tool in the sonata principle. And, just as analogous ways of thought had led German authors to embrace the novel as their major genre, so the instrumental symphony and its attendant or derivative schemes became the highest expression of the national ideal in music. Both symphony and novel were, so to speak, "slices" of revealed inner life and psychological activity. But whereas the novel could really deal only with specific facts and manifested details, the gradual evolution of symphonic thought car- ried the listener into realms of universal appre- hension and broad generalities of emotion and experience. From this point of view tunes, with their seemingly inbuilt tendency to shape themselves in regular periods, were analogous to concrete facts and specific details. They were the "nouns" of music, if you like, and as such could hardly play the part of seeds in the growth of symphonic trees. For German composers, therefore, the tex- turally pregnant and potentially active theme was much more promising and "genuine" than even the most perfectly-chiselled melody. It was precisely this aspect of Beethoven's Trios, op. 70, which made so strong an appeal to Hoffmann in 1813: "A simple but fruitful theme, songlike, susceptible to the most varied contrapuntal treatments, curtailments, and so forth, forms the basis of each movement; all remaining sub- sidiary themes and figures are intimately related to the main idea in such a way that the details all interweave, arranging themselves among the in- struments in highest unity."'53 It was not only to the individual and separate movements of a work that this desire for organic unity applied, however, for the whole composi- tion had to be coherent in such a way that every constituent detail, no matter how small, was felt to contribute to the whole and, eventually, to root itself in one basic seed or vitally imaginative conception. Speaking of C. G. Muiller's Third Symphony, for instance, Schumann praised the slow movement for leaving the hearer in a state of anticipation, with a feeling that there was "something more to come"; and Schumann praised this situation as "a dramatic advance over the movements of other symphonies, par- ticularly of the old school, where the four parts are rounded off inwardly as well as out- wardly."'54 In this feeling of incompleteness-in- itself, and in the sense of anticipation which it engendered, Mfiller had caught the very essence of the times. It was human yearning symbolized in ordered sound and, because of this, his sym- phony represented a definite advance over those of "the old school." Hence arose all those continuous or near- one-movement extended works in which a har- monically-conceived theme worked itself out across a wide tonal field in a variety of closely BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 127</page><page sequence="32">19TH CENTURY MUSIC interwoven textures and related schemes. Hence, also, sprang the innumerable musical reminiscences and subtle thematic cross-refer- ences within and between distinct movements of a work which was so characteristic a tech- nique of the day. Hence, finally, grew the concept of Wagnerian leitmotiv which, refined into a dis- ciplined technique and matured into an ana- logue for natural evolution, could extend across four successive evenings and gather the multi- tudinous aspects of the Ring into one glorious organic whole. To gather three parts into a whole is, I believe, the intention of sonata, concerto and symphony compos- ers. With the older composers it was done more for- mally, or more pro forma, the emphasis being on ex- ternal physiognomy and tonality; the younger composers broadened the individual parts into sub- sections and discovered a new middle movement, the scherzo. One was no longer satisfied to restrict an idea and its development to a single movement. One hid it, in other guises and fragmentations, in the following movements. In short, one wanted to introduce histor- ical interest ... and, as the times grew more poetic, dramatic interest, too. Even more recently the ten- dency has been to draw the movements themselves more closely together, and to bind them by instanta- neous transitions from one to the other.ss55 Schumann's introduction into this context of the notion of historical interest-a notion at which he beseeched his interlocutor not to laugh-conveys in a single phrase that feeling for the potential comprehensiveness of organic method which characterized contemporary Ger- man thinking, and which contrasts dramatically with those ideas of historical accuracy and sci- entific verisimilitude so beloved of the French. French ideas resulted in an impassioned search for the specificities of local color, scientifically rendered into art: whereas for Schumann "his- torical" meant not a direct imitation of outward things culled from an age and clime remote from contemporary life, but references, either direct or oblique, to musical ideas previously current in the work itself. This was both more "musical" in the narrow sense of the term and more "har- monious" in the widest sense possible. Thus any extended composition should itself be a para- digm of natural organic development and growth, a celebration of the harmonious propor- tions set between God and Nature, Man and Art, and Art and God's Morality. Thirty-seven years before Schumann wrote the article in which these observations were made, Friederich Schlegel had praised Goethe's Wilhelm Meister in terms which carry a remark- ably similar resonance: "The inherent drive of this thoroughly organized and organizing work to form itself into one whole expresses itself in the larger as in the smaller combinations. No pause is fortuitous and insignificant, and ... everything is at the same time means and end.""56 And twenty-six years before this, as we have seen, Goethe himself had summed up his impression of Strasbourg Cathedral as "an impression of oneness, wholeness and greatness ... an impression which, because it consisted of a thousand harmonizing details, I could savor and enjoy, but by no means understand."157 In his impression of unity or oneness; in his use of the word "harmonizing"; and in his implied rec- ognition that scientific analysis and precise de- scription could never vouchsafe a full under- standing of any psychological experience which a human being might both "savor and enjoy"- that there was in other words still "something more to come"-Goethe came near to delineat- ing the very essence of Romanticism itself. Henceforth no German writer could escape the iridescence of his vision, nor remain unaffected by the beauty of his insight. Speaking specifi- cally of German opera, Weber said that his coun- trymen desired "... an art work complete in itself, in which the partial contributions of the related and collaborating arts blend together, dis- appear, and, in disappearing, somehow form a new world."158 This widespread desire for unity, for har- mony, and for what perhaps we should call the suprarational rather than the irrational element in experience and art, helps to account for the fundamental stability of the national musical language and accent from the time of Haydn's maturity to the high days of Wagnerism-a point which is too infrequently made in the textbooks most commonly to hand. Unlike its counterpart in France, Romanticism in Germany was not so much a fight against the dogmatic stance of an entrenched, centralized, and authoritarian Clas- 128</page><page sequence="33">sicism as it was an extension of already-proven organic methods into ever widening fields of ac- tion for increasingly subtle and expressive ends. Between past, present, and future no great chasm seemed to yawn; instead there was a natural progression and growth from one point of devel- opment to the next. Nothing was ever really "realized" at all. Everything was always in the process of becoming. From this point of view even the progress of German music itself throughout these years could legitimately be described as organic, for it seemed to form a harmonious whole in which the "inner parts" were proportioned to their outer contours like the core of an oak tree to its leafy crown. In German eyes, therefore, music could indeed be seen as inherently romantic; and Schumann could with honesty declare that he found it difficult to imagine how this "essen- tially romantic art" could ever form "a distinctly romantic school within itself."'59 The problems faced by Romantic composers in Germany were not really those of vocabulary at all, but mainly those of large-scale harmony or form. Again, this is a point which is not suffi- ciently stressed by most analytical critics, or by the general run of writers on nineteenth-century music. Indeed, one often wonders if they realize it at all: for, far from being a time in which formal considerations were pushed to one side in favor of a loosely-defined and sentimentalized expres- siveness, as many of these writers would seem to suggest, the Romantic years were years during which such problems occupied the very center of the stage. At a time of crisis in the European conscience, when notions of social reform and political reformulation were daily in the air; at a time when the rapport between art and life was thought to be so close that men sought psycho- logical rejuvenation and social insight in and from the arts; at a time when Mazzini could appeal to music to develop a social and a political conscience as well as an artistic one;160 and at a time when repression alternated with revolu- tion, communist faced capitalist and socialist squared up to conservative on every side, how could the arts and artists stand aloof, encapsu- lated in a private world of hallowed schemes and performing liturgies of exclusive rites in which only the initiated could partake? No! The prob- lem was not what to say, for the substance of their thought was the chief cause of contempo- rary strain and tension, but how to say it, how to express, control, and discipline their expanding consciousness so that society should not be to- tally overwhelmed, and the arts fragmented and destroyed. Wagner was not entirely off the mark when, pursuing his particular conception of Gesamt- kunstwerk and admitting his enormous debt to Beethoven, he cleared the ground on which his disciples would proclaim that his way was the true way for music to develop in the future. For musicians in Germany, Beethoven marked the point of no return. His effect on their thinking and experience was equivalent to that of the Rev- olution on their colleagues in France. This is a significant equivalence when seen in the light of our original question about the differences in sound-quality between their respective scores: for French composers had no figure comparable with Beethoven in their musical Pantheon, only a host of distinguished litterateurs, dramatists, and musical tragedians whose thought had helped to provoke a social and political upheaval with aesthetic overtones. In a nation that be- lieved that art was generated primarily by art such a situation was intolerable. It helps to ac- count for the extremes of behavior, both social and artistic, to which so many French Romanti- cists were driven. For Romanticists they were, rather than genuine Romantics in the German mold; and their attempts to pour the old wine of mnlodie into contemporary formal bottles which had been largely fashioned abroad, pro- voked a crisis in musical technique from which, because of their established symphonic and in- strumental tradition and the culminating figure of Beethoven, German composers were more easily able to escape. References to form, to the formal problems posed by heightened consciousness and to the need for large-scale reformation of past artistic schemes, abound in German nineteenth-cen- tury writings upon music. Even so pedantic a figure as Hauptmann was forced to admit that, BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 129</page><page sequence="34">19TH CENTURY MUSIC after the works of Beethoven, form was no longer a constant but a variable quantity. He had to agree that in the attempt to control this variable- ness even the greatest of men might falter on occasion: "Form varies considerably from time to time. Before the days of Beethoven, very indif- ferent composers were much more certain of their construction than far greater men have been since."'161 If there was a decline in the aver- age standard of musical composition during the Romantic years-and, when one considers the high technical quality of much that was written by second-rank composers in the preceding pe- riod, such a conclusion seems inevitable-the reason lay mainly here, in the area of construc- tion and artistic syntax. To possess a heightened consciousness and a rich vocabulary but to have no certain grasp of grammatical construction or linguistic limits-in other words, not to know how to put imaginative thought to good artistic use-is an almost sure recipe for failure in any undertaking. It is analogous to being possessed by great religious feeling while having no spe- cific faith, a situation in which, significantly, many Romantic artists seemed to find them- selves. It was for this reason then that Schumann expressed misgivings about contemporary man- ifestations of the sonata principle, and wondered whether it had anything more to say. "A few fine works in this style have since appeared and may yet be made public; but, on the whole, it looks as if this form had run its course. This is as it should be, for we cannot repeat the same forms for cen- turies, and ought rather to think about creating something new."'62 So magnificent and so over- whelming was the inheritance bequeathed by Beethoven, however, that to all who lacked true genius, the creation of new formal schemes and the uncovering of fresh formalizing insights had become well-nigh impossible. Mere talent was caught in the amber of routine, and had no idea on how it might break free: "We Germans ... are not poor in quartets; but very few among us have known how to augment the existing capital."'63 And the price extorted from mere talent for this lack of true creative imagination was reckoned up in terms of an increasing and often inhibiting self-consciousness which forced many of the weaker spirits to embrace a career of desperate plagiarism. We find many too close imitations but very, very sel- dom... any true maintenance or mastery of this sub- lime form in which, bound in a spiritual union, con- tinually changing ideas succeed one another. The great number of recent symphonies drop into the o- verture style, especially in their first movements; slow movements are there because slow movements are required; the scherzos have nothing of the scherzo about them save the name; the last movements com- pletely forget what the former ones contained.'64 In its progress through the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, therefore, music may be said to have shed a great deal of its formal and emotional innocence. And Romanticism, which broadly speaking may be described as an organic emotional variation played upon a pre- pared Classical ground, became not so much the great age of illusion as a time for profound de- spair. Hence the frenetic quality beneath which so much of its poorer music reels, and the occa- sional hysteria of some of even its greatest mu- sical manifestations. Broadly speaking, the situation in Germany was analogous to that in France, where, as we have seen, an equally strong national tradition conditioned the whole Romantic attitude and where, in reaction, a riot of sentimental effusion had led to a wealth of formal ineptitude. But the similarity should not be pressed too far. Because of its operatic and theatrical traditions, France had never fully fallen under the spell of the so- nata principle, and the formal problems faced by its composers continued to be posed in terms of melody and solved in terms of increasingly col- orful treatments of melodic line. That this had profound effects upon the tonal and harmonic physiognomy of French music goes without say- ing. But the impetus behind these effects came from a position diametrically opposite to that in which most German musicians found them- selves. In Germany the sonata principle began with the deployment of tonalities, and thence moved on to fashion its thematic material ac- cording to the dictates of a tonally-engendered harmony. In attempting to adapt the tonal, har- monic, and motivic patterns of behavior estab- lished by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven to the 130</page><page sequence="35">expressive requirements of the new age, Roman- tic composers in Germany were forced to probe more deeply than ever before into what Schu- mann called "the mysteries of harmony," and to seek expressive subtlety in a chromatic coloring of masses which, if not deftly handled, could seriously undermine those proportions of over- all form which they, like he, so highly val- ued."The endeavour to interest as a harmonist, even in small details, may become very danger- ous," Schumann warned in one of his reviews. "All the enharmonic art of Spohr is nothing be- side Handel's freely flowing triads. Therefore a composer must, above all things, guard himself against an overemphasis on harmony; such an overladen chromatic maze in the middle voices can be dangerous even to the instrumental parts.,,165 Despite being caught between the Scylla of unharmonious proportion and the Charybdis of Romantic sentiment, however, German com- posers of the day never lost their faith in the ultimately superior expressive powers of chordal harmony. Nor did they cease to exploit to the full its deep emotive strength. Thus, to the many other confrontations and oppositions which af- flicted Europe at that time must be added that of French melody and German harmony. These now faced one another, militantly, across the Rhine, and the words which each army's camp- following critics hurled across its strongly-flow- ing waters were often insulting and condemna- tory in the extreme. Both German harmony and French melody saw the expression of human feeling as their chief raison d'etre, but both were conditioned by, and still confined within, the distinct technical and philosophical traditions which had nurtured and sustained them through the centuries. However, the great advantage of organic notions was that, by definition, they pro- moted growth. Thus Goethe's insight had pro- vided German composers with a way out of their formal impasse, a viable path by which the mon- strous chasm separating Art from Nature could be safely overpassed. For the French, unfortu- nately, no such route lay open. The idle fixe of melody cooled into that aesthetic star which shone immovably in the static hierarchy of their still additive and Cartesian universe. Two contrasted remarks by two eminent mu- sicians illustrate exactly this division. The first comes from an article by Reicha, published in the Journal des Arts for 1813, the second from the collection of aphorisms with which Schu- mann prefaced his Album for the Young. [Melody is] the language of feeling.166 We have learned to express the more delicate nuances of feeling by penetrating more deeply into the myster- ies of harmony.'67 Just as organicism alone was not enough for the German sensibility, just as it had to be suf- fused by a conscious teleology, so mere penetra- tion of the mysteries of harmony was felt to be insufficient for the composition of expressive works of music. Once secured, the mysteries of harmony had to be manipulated in such a way that the human soul was transported to those distant realms of feeling which it was music's function to explore. Lacking this quality of imag- inative judgement-what Coleridge had called in a memorable phrase the "shaping spirit of Imagination"168-those technically competent and academically astute composers whom Sten- dhal had dismissed as "fools and pedants" could indeed be accused of "meddling in the art of music."169 That composer alone has truly mastered the secrets of harmony who knows how, by their means, to work upon the human soul.. ."170 In other words the crowning secret of harmonic aptitude was neither emotional surrender nor technical display, but imaginative control, artis- tic discipline. The true master of harmony was he who had passed through the doors of harmo- niousness, and who in consequence possessed what Hauptmann termed "that instinct for ar- rangement-that feeling for form which should be proof against a torrent of sentiment."'17 From all this two interrelated and interde- pendent points seem to emerge. In the first place we are returned to that concept of musical archi- tecture, to that impression of "one-ness, whole- ness and greatness" which had so caught the imagination of the young Goethe as he stood before the mass of Strasbourg Minster and BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 131</page><page sequence="36">19TH CENTURY MUSIC which, coinciding so aptly with his insight into organic method and its immanent rapport with the processes of art, had guided the whole future direction of cultural development in Germany. In the second place, we are made to understand that, in Germany-as indeed in France, although for different reasons-no "torrent of sentiment," however deeply felt, was a necessary guarantee of excellence in art. It was a lesson of which the more extreme varieties of Romantic sensibility stood in urgent need. For, with their firm belief in the unlimited expressive powers of chordal harmony, German composers of talent, as dis- tinct from those of genius, ran the risk of sacri- ficing a noble and clear grasp of architectural balance at the feet of those ephemeral delights which rose like a cloud of incense from the chordal sequences of sensuous chromatic har- mony. The linear vulgarity of the French rom- ance was matched, on the other side of the Rhine, by the titillating thrills of chromatic mass. Against such a sacrifice Schumann warned in an article on Hiller's Etudes, op. 15, in 1835: "The most insignificant person can be complete as long as he acts within the boundaries of his own abilities and accomplishments; but even the most beautiful attributes can be obscured, inval- idated, or nullified if that utterly essential factor of proportion is ignored or violated."'172 Ulti- mately, therefore, in Schumann's mind, all was reduced to a matter of proportion, to a question of equilibrium in which structure was suffused with feeling and sentiment enhanced by form. As he summed the matter up in his remarkable essay on Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique-still a major article in the canon of European criti- cism-"Form is the vessel of the Spirit."'73 If one were asked to say precisely how this dif- fered from the immanent ideal of Classicism, however, the answer would be difficult to phrase. For it seems to be the case, as I have already indicated, that in Germany Classicism was not so much the antagonist of Romanticism as its necessary precondition. Without Haydn and Mozart, Schubert and Schumann would have been inconceivable. If Beethoven had never been, we should not now know our Brahms. Had Wagner been nurtured solely on a diet of Gluck and of tragedie lyrique, then Tristan and Isolde would never have celebrated their passionate ag- ony in music whose cast and texture is the apoth- eosis of the whole symphonic tradition. It is dif- ficult to escape the conclusion, therefore, that the secret of musical Romanticism in Germany lies somewhere within or about its extension of Classical practice; that it was more a matter of syntax at heart than a question of basic vocabu- lary; that German Romanticism in music was primarily a matter of style; and that that style was the natural and organic development of the style which had preceded it. If this is so, then the answer to Schumann's heart felt query "Who can meet the require- ments of the profoundly intensified present?"174 must be phrased as much in terms of knowledge and of education as it is in those of feeling or of sentiment. While it is true that he emphasized the inadequacy in art of intelligence alone, it is also true that Schumann expected any artist wor- thy of the name to achieve complete control of his medium-to match his Spirit with his sense of Form: "art is served only by the masterly. Whoever cannot supply this everywhere and at all times has no claim to be called a true art- ist."'75 To be able to supply the masterly at any given moment and to know exactly the right time at which any particular means should be employed, is more likely to be the product of skill and application than the spontaneous out- come of revelation-even with those consumed by an extreme attack of Romantic fervor. Thus a particular course of academic study and training was essential to the would-be composer if feeling were ever to receive the gift of tongues in music. To extend Schumann's own phrase, Form is the necessary vehicle of the Spirit. And, because the methods of artistic creation in the Romantic years were still basically those which had been employed by the artists of the immediate past, the ingredients of the course to be followed in the new age would show no fundamental change from those involved before. The basis of this course of training was the traditional German one of the written exercise, of harmony and counterpoint, and with no more time than was essential devoted to the beguiling art of improvization. This last, as Schumann pointed out, might weaken the student's grasp 132</page><page sequence="37">of formal principles, of architectural harmony, and lead him to waste his time in the pursuit of shadowy musical pictorialism: "beware of los- ing yourself too often in a talent that will lead you to waste strength and time on shadowy pic- tures. You will only obtain mastery of form and the power of clear construction by firm strokes of the pen. Therefore, write more often than you improvize."'176 Throughout his writings, but particularly in his aphoristic preface to the Album for the Young, Schumann emphasized the importance to the aspiring musician of a thorough grounding in the laws of musical harmony and of counter- point. Like so many exponents of his own tradi- tion he advised all students to come to grips with music's inner parts, in every sense of the term. For such knowledge was a sure pathway toward the goal of true musicality, and it could not be entered upon too soon. "Learn the fundamental laws of harmony at an early age,"'77 he urges. And even more significantly, "Regularly sing in choruses, especially the middle voices. This will make you musical."'78 This was an opinion with which the young Wagner found himself in full agreement. In his 1840 article on "German Music," Wagner set forth to outline the difference between the musi- cal characteristics of the leading European na- tions. Whereas for him the Italian was "a singer" and the Frenchman "a virtuoso," the German was "a musician." With this primary and abso- lutely fundamental distinction in his mind, he went on to elaborate the exact significance of the term "musician" in his chosen context, and he left his readers in no doubt about its general superiority over the other two. Such a man was not a "feeler" only, but also a thinker, not just a doer, but one who understood his art as well: "one must bear in mind just what is meant when one speaks of a German musician ... usually he is also a composer, and not a mere empiricist either, but thoroughly grounded in harmony and counterpoint."'79 A profound knowledge and understanding of the "mysteries of harmony," therefore, both structural and chordal, was the distinguishing mark of every German musician worthy of the name. By its means the greatest among them could create musical structures of truly Gothic proportions, structures in which each organic detail aided the vital balance of the whole, structures whose expressive power was greater than the sum of their individual har- monic parts, structures which, taken in their unity, revealed "the nation's deep artistic intuition"'80 in every movement, phrase, and bar. Even some French critics were driven to ad- mit the truth of this general view, and on occa- sion to praise it. In his extended article on Mey- erbeer, published in the Revue de Paris for 1831, Joseph D'Ortigue lauded the composer of Robert le diable for bringing together and unifying-by which term he meant gathering together within one framework: in other words ensemble-the Italian, French and German traditions in music. Italy he designated the land of pure melodic in- vention, and France the home of general artistic combination. But Germany possessed the su- preme power of overall musical conception, a power which he could not too highly praise, and one which was the secret envy of every other land. It was an architectural rather than a deco- rative power, one whose roots lay not in melodic detail but in harmonious proportion. Treating human nature as but an element in Nature uni- versal, it was worthy of being described as a truly creative power; and its greatest fruits were not those of the opera house but the symphonic glo- ries of the concert hall and chamber. As for Germany, it adds to the genius for invention and to that for combination another genius which I shall call that of conception; and here I do not intend only the ability to produce good tunes, good melodic ideas, but also of co-ordinating the constituent details of a composition on a vast scale, with perfectly har- monious proportions between them: a plan which, by its profundity and its simplicity, demonstrates at one and the same time, that the composer has delved into his heart and into the sanctuary of Nature. Only a plan conceived along these lines deserves the name of cre- ation. Such are the plans of Weber's overtures and those of the quartets, quintets [sic], and symphonies of Beethoven. 181 It is important that none of this should lead us to suppose for a single instant that German composers remained wholly indifferent to the expressive powers of melody. Such a supposition would be untenable in view of the inspired tra- dition of the lied and of Schumann's particular position within it. Even in his instrumental and BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 133</page><page sequence="38">19TH CENTURY MUSIC keyboard works the prevailing atmosphere cre- ated by Schumann's often stepwise lines is lyri- cal. As he expressed it in a review of Mendels- sohn's Six Preludes and Fugues, op. 35, it was just this element of melodiousness which gave to contemporary compositions "the more re- fined sweetness characteristic of modern mu- sic.'"'12 But lyrical is not necessarily tuneful; and tune is but a subdivision of the general class named melody. This distinction was recognized by the more sensitive men of the day because it was the source of many of their formal difficul- ties. The contrast between tune and melody is perhaps directly analogous to the tension which obtains between melody and the sonata princi- ple. Significantly, it reflects the antagonism be- tween amateur and professional, between fa- cility and mastery, between vocal music and instrumental, of which contemporary critics were so aware. "Melody" is the amateur's warcry, and certainly mu- sic without melody is not music. Therefore you must understand what amateurs mean by this word: any- thing easily, rhythmically pleasing. But there are mel- odies of a very different type; at whatever page you open Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, etc., they will appear to you in a thousand different guises. If you study these you will soon tire of the monotony of modem Italian opera melodies.'83 Although Schumann was less than just in applying it to, for instance, all of Bellini's work, "anything easily, rhythmically pleasing" was a passably accurate description of the average type of tune which flourished so abundantly during the Romantic years. By Schumann's ideal, F6- tis's notion of the squarely-fashioned tune stood thoroughly condemned. Because of their insist- ence upon the superiority of melody in all things musical, most French musicians could be classed as amateurs, and this despite the fact that their amateurism was of a peculiarly profes- sional kind. Although tune made up in adroit- ness and grace what it lacked in profundity and significance, to German ears the debt was irre- deemable. The settlement lacked that very sub- stance which was the essential characteristic of music in their eyes. To Schumann, and to those who shared his views, tune alone was a superfi- cial and sensual phenomenon, the surface of har- mony perhaps, but never the decider of the game. Whatever beauty might inform a tuneful piece was wholly concentrated in its melodic line. It therefore lacked proportion; and the opin- ion of Stendhal, who saw all music in terms of a pictorial technique in which the foreground should be emphasized and the background kept discreet, was anathema by their reckoning. ... in the domain of art generally, all the really superb effects are produced through one medium of extreme beauty, and not by a whole series of manifestations in separate media, each one in itself of mediocre beauty.184 Nor could anything less sympathetic to their ideas be imagined than Gabriel Lemoyne's view of the relative importance of singer and accom- panist, a view stated explicitly and amusingly in his instructions to the pianist about to perform l'Harmonica in 1807: "This accompaniment must be played so lightly that its notes are scarcely audible.""18 Even when speaking specifically of the lied, Schumann was unable to regard the vocal line as the supremely important element of the genre. It was at best but primus inter pares, a powerful ingredient indeed, but one which contributed to a greater musical whole whose dominating force was harmony. Paralleling the development of poetry, the Franz Schu- bert epoch has already been followed by a new one which has utilized the improvements of the simulta- neously developed instrument of accompaniment, the piano... The voice alone cannot reproduce every- thing or produce every effect; together with the expression of the whole the finer details of the poem should also be emphasized; and all is well so long as the vocal line is not sacrificed.'86 But perhaps his most telling comment on the relative powers of melody and harmony was con- tained in his analogy between music and the game of chess: "Music resembles chess. The queen (melody) has the greatest power, but the king (harmony) decides the game."'87 Thus, the ability of Bach and other German composers to express the inner meaning of a chorale text not through the melody alone, but through what Wagner called their "rich and pow- erful harmonies,"'88 received its Romantic transfiguration in the keyboard constituent of the lied. All Schumann's songs confirm this pro- 134</page><page sequence="39">cess of development, for in them poetry and mu- sic find their perfect consummation in the equal partnership of a singer with his pianist. This "one-ness" of impression, to borrow Goethe's phrase, contrasts sharply with that "two-ness" of effect which informs the French operatic aria and romance. Both French and German writers of the time agreed that accompaniment was es- sential to the complete meaning of a song, but each differed from the other in assessing the rel- ative importance of the parts. In the romance the piano part was illustrative of detail, either phys- ical or emotional, and because these details changed from verse to verse, from line to line or even from word to word, the result was always additive ensemble and never organic unity. In a true lied, however, voice and keyboard inter- twined in an open-ended dialogue which caught the essence of the poetic theme entire. And the song was never completely sung until the fingers had at last released the keys. The prelude and the postlude of a lied were integral parts of the whole artistic conception. No German critic would have referred to them as "ritornelli," as did the critic of France Musicale when writing of Schu- bert's Death and the Maiden in March 1838. The kind of line which Schumann could dig- nify as melody, then, is clearly indicated by him in the second part of his aphorism on the ama- teur's war-cry. It was that of Bach, of Mozart, and of Beethoven, a line which, in his own words, could adopt "a thousand different guises" and so avoid monotony. No doubt these guises were the same as those which had struck Hoffmann in the Beethoven trios, "varied contrapuntal treat- ments, curtailments and so forth."'89 Whatever his own practice may have been at times, there- fore, Schumann's ideal melody seems to have been the formally pregnant theme. It was a theme of architectural promise whose own in- VI Drawing together the various strands of thought which have run through the preceding sections, they seem to knot themselves about two funda- mental and contrasting concepts, unity and en- semble. Only upon the most superficial level ternal proportions were harmonious and whose formal growth was conditioned by a developing environment like that of the "trees of God." It was "born in a region lying deeper than the vocal chords: in the musical heart of a German genius where everything is music."190 It came from the center of things, from the heart, from those mid- dle voices in choruses which he had recom- mended all aspiring young musicians to per- form. But first and foremost it was musical, and in this quality lay its only claim to melodious- ness. I say again that not all that is easy to sing constitutes a melody! There is a difference between melody and melodies. Who possesses melody also possesses mel- odies, but the reverse is not always true. The child sings his melodies to himself; melody, however, is developed later in life. The first two chords of Beet- hoven's Eroica, for instance, contain more melody than ten melodies by Bellini.'19 Like harmony and harmonies, therefore, to the distinction of which that between melody and melodies is directly analogous, the ability to create true melody was the product of profes- sional skill and mastery. It was the daughter of Time, the fruit of learning and the final achieve- ment of study. It could never be confused with tune. How different is all this from that descrip- tion of the "song of feeling" which Thi6bault gave in his singing manual Du Chant. Published in 1813, it describes not the fruit of organic mu- sical growth, but the outcome of careful artistic accumulation- ... a natural, simple song, well adapted to the sense of the words, to their expression and their prosody, of which grace is the chief merit and which, in accor- dance with the words, and with an appropriate variety of vehemence, should be sad, delicate, naive, tender, or melancholy.192 can these two concepts be confused and thought to be synonymous. For whereas unity implies a fusion, a wholeness whose quintessence is greater than, and qualitatively different from, the mere sum of its individual parts, en- BRIAN PRIMMER Unity and Ensemble 135</page><page sequence="40">19TH CENTURY MUSIC semble signifies a gathering together of sep- arate elements whose distinct integrities re- main unsullied by their mutual contact and association. The qualitative essence of ensemble results entirely from the clash and interplay of disparate ideas which in themselves remain largely idles fixes, and in the affective interaction of near- adjacent or contiguous donnees, all working within the discipline of a confining framework. There is, in consequence, an appreciable tension between the various elements of ensemble, and between them and the bounding frame which, apart from any intrinsic merit which this last may hold per se, concentrates the minds of art- ists and percipients alike upon constituent de- tails. It is in the interaction of these very details that the source of our enjoyment lies. Thus as percipients we are called upon first to register the finesse with which each of these is molded, then to assess the sensitivity with which all of them are deployed, and finally to judge of the success with which every facet is held in place throughout a comprehensive, balanced equilib- rium. Any work constructed in accordance with the notion of ensemble is, in a very real sense, an objet d'art. It is art for art's own sake, and must be treated so. More amenable to aesthetic con- templation than susceptible of emotional in- volvement, more theatrical than dramatic and therefore, I suppose, more likely to inform an opera than a symphony, it is comparable with the scientific models to which it runs so clearly parallel, and is best spoken of in terms of struc- tured elegance and line. Being fundamentally a decorative approach to art, it lies open to the immanent threat of formalism, and remains at all times quite distinct from Nature or from life. These it may reflect, as the mirror does the lamp, or run beside, as in some witty parody of Carte- sian dualism. But it can in no way be identified with them. Now none of this is really so with unity. Fused into an essence which is far greater than the sum of its constituent parts, a work con- ceived according to the high ideal of unity seems part of something larger than itself. It aims be- yond, toward a dream, a vision, or ideal, which makes its own ultimate insufficiency as individ- ual work (or even as narrowly autonomous me- dium) acceptable. Inviting us to join it in its search, it lies open more to moral than to purely aesthetic interpretation; and somehow we come to be absorbed in it, as human beings as well as musicians, as it eventually will be itself absorbed into the boundless Infinite. Such a work is appre- ciably teleological, seeming to fulfill a purpose greater than its own, losing its concentration on immediate sensation in its fascination with ul- timate experience and attempting to achieve this end through processes which are directly analogous to those of Nature or of life. Like these, therefore, it is best discussed in biological terms, in organic metaphors and naturalistic im- ages. Such anthropomorphism applied to any art, however, dissolves the clear-cut boundaries between it and life. For just as all the elements within a separate work are thought to fuse into a single entity, so now is art itself-of which this work, this medium, too, is but a single strand- deemed part of life. Effectively life and art be- come identified: and both are heard as leitmotivs in the supreme Gesamtkunstwerk conceived by God. As we have seen throughout the body of this essay, unity is essentially a Germanic ideal in art from about the middle of the eighteenth century onwards, while France prefers ensemble even in Romantic times. Now it is just this last which makes me wonder if the full Romantic tide can ever really inundate the soul of France at all. For although French artists can easily master its many outward attitudes-a mastery to which the strong theatrical tradition of their State gives both encouragement and support, and which in- cludes vehement lip-service to the idea of it as well-the mysterious inner processes which seem essential to this way of treating things ap- pear to elude them. Their work is not organic in the German sense but cumulative, with all the delight in detail, in technical facility and virtu- osity of presentation which that word implies. Nothing shows this up more clearly than the opposed evaluations of sensational immediacy which one finds on the different sides of the Rhine. In French scores every note, phrase, or chord tends to have a physiological integrity which it neither possesses nor needs in those by composers of the German school. These last are so taken up with the evolutionary progress of 136</page><page sequence="41">their material as a whole that they have no ears to dwell upon the purely individual impact of each contributory detail. It is the structural func- tion of any part which concerns them most, and not its separate personality. The threefold sen- suous delight in sonority, clarity, and elegance which informs most French scores-regardless of the century, style, or genre in which they were composed-has no apparent parallel on the far side of the Rhine. There all is interfused, rumi- native and purposeful, moving toward Nirvana in an ecstasy of Becoming which can only be termed near-mystical. Here, on the other hand, all is interlocked, of immediate effect and self- explanatory, vibrant in its own dovetailed integ- rity and wit, and caught up in a rapture of sheer Being which is little short of absolute. Now the irony of this last statement strikes me hard: for it seems to suggest that what I take to be the less musically-inclined of these two nations, France, is in fact the fount of purity in sound, while Germany, the much more deeply musical on nearly every count, seems somehow to adulterate its scores with resonances which reach far beyond their notes and set up echoes through the universe. Yet ironical though this statement may seem, I find it generally confirmed by all my listening as well as by my reading. There is what I can only describe as a greater degree of self- possession about the sound of French music than there is about that which comes from Germany, more consciousness of music as an art practised by men and less apprehension of it as an elemen- tal force working through them. It is impression- istic rather than expressionistic, real rather than ideal, tactile rather than intangible. More an- cient than modem, more pagan than Christian, more worldly-wise than mystical, it prefers to bathe in delicate human sentiment than serve as a sounding-board for messages from the Infinite. As an art of nuance and finesse and never one of passionate argument or truly extra-musical hy- pothesis-and this despite its largely superflu- ous programs, titles, and literary addenda-it is, if you will allow the analogy, poetry in notes as distinct from prose. By this I do not mean poetry in the later and more flaccid sense but, as I pointed out in section III, in that of its Greek original-in the sense of being "that which is made." Logically, therefore, those who made it can indeed be signalled poets: and their chief concern is casting images in notes. Quite the opposite, it seems to me, may be said of German scores. The very nature of their thematic material, the absolute necessity for them to develop in what contemporary critics called "organic" ways, their explicit purposive- ness and comprehensive intent and their relative unconcern with concrete images in notes, create a quality which, in keeping with my present metaphor, is better designated prose-like than poetic. A modem writer who has made considerable play with this idea in the field of literature is Sartre. In What is Literature? he distinguishes between poetry and prose along lines which run directly parallel with those drawn out above- though without their national overtones. When mentioning music itself he reveals his own in- trinsic French-ness, it seems to me, by equating the composer with the poet precisely because the musician is a man who "dwells upon" indi- vidual sounds, as a poet dwells upon separate words, or a painter upon distinct colors. And this seems to me to be the point: for poets, he says, "are men who refuse to utilize language. They have chosen the poetic attitude, which considers words as things and not as signs." It is in the almost complete lack of any sense of the ontologically significative about their scores; in the near-complete refusal of French composers to utilize their language in their works; and in the way in which they dwell so expressively upon each note, or chord, or phrase that I find the chief source of that difference between the sound of their works and that of their colleagues from across the Rhine-which it was my purpose to illuminate-to lie.
