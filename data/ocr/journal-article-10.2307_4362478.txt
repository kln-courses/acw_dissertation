RECENT Ministerial pronouncements on food policy give further confirmation of how limited a role government seeks to play in the whole business of feed- ing the population, the so-called 'take-over' of wholesale trade in foodgrains notwithstanding. Thanks to the unloading of foodgrains from public stocks to private traders and the failure to achieve even one-half of the kharif procure- ment target, the government's stocks reduced to 2.7 mnn tonnes at the beginIning of this month. These are proposed to be replenished by procurement of 7-8 mn tonnes from the rabi crop. Since the wheat crop is currently estimated at nearly 30 mn tonnes, the projected order of procurement may be achieved. Last year, when the wheat crop was 26 mn tonnes, procurement had been 6 mn tonnes. This year, with the so-called take-over of wholesale trade, an additional couple of million tonnes for the public stocks are the least that should be expected. But will stocks of this order be enough for feeding the population? The gov- ernment evidently thinks so. It actually expects to have a 'buffer stock' at the beginning of July. But even with what the Miinister has himself described as an 'inequitable and deficient' distribution system, about 9 lakh tonnes per ;nonth are on an average demanded from the public distribution system. Drawals from the public stocks have increased to over twice as much in recent months. Clear- lv, the government's idea of having enough stocks to feed the population is simply to have just enough to keep the wholly inadequate public distribution system from total collapse. More cynical perhaps than its assessment of what is adequate foodgrains production, procurement, or stock, is the government's tendency in recent months to project an anthropomorphic view of the public distribution system. The Ministers concerned have dubbed this system defective time and again and have held it responsible for everything ranging from the "price rise of food- grains" to the "widespread distress" in certain regions. Yet, apart from asking the states to increase the number of fair price shops and allowing the Food Corporation to foolishly unload its stocks to traders in the open market with a view to bringing down prices, what has been done to strengthen the system? A clue about how the government views its own role in food distribution is to be had from the decision to club Delhi with Haryana when, from April 1, in- dividual states are to become separate wheat zones to facilitate procurement. In other words, the government will largely rely on private trade to meet the food- grain requirements of the capital city. Similarly, both the government and the Congress Working Committee have been at pains to underscore that the take- over of wholesale trade did not imply statutory rationing, even in the bigger cities. What sense does State monopoly of wholesale trade make without ade- quate controlled sales outlets? True, the number of fair price shops have in- creased from 1.22 lakhs in 1970 to 1.66 lakhs in 1973, but their spread among the various states is very uneven andl a large number of them are operated by private traders who can at will divert the stocks from public to private account. What frightens the government about statutory rationing is, of course, the fact that it makes explicit the real demnd for foodgrains and with it the ac- tual gap in supplies. The obfuscations of the 'take-over' of wholesale trade - monopoly procurement of marketed (not marketable) surplus, delicensing of wholesale traders but permitting sales by licensed retailers and growers, allow- ing an open market with prices stipulated at around 'fair prices' - make sense in this context. The marketed surplus so rounded up will be about the same as what finds its way into government stocks after a good rabi orop; the res- ponsibility for anything more than this is, in political and administrative terms, too much for the government. Even so, the attempt to create alibis to explain away possible failures has already begun. The government has been hinting at the threat of a possible 'sabotage from within' by the bureaucracy. Gwrain traders of course know better, despite the public breast-beating of last wveek's hartai. Thus while wheat prices are said to be declining in the wheat mandis of the North they have been maintained or are even rising, in the retail markets.</page></plain_text>
