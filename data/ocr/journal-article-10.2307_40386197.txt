<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS By H. Spiegel Preface Τ Ν recent years numerous new approaches have been made towards " primitive -*- art ", and studies of sociological and technical aspects have provided insight into the problems of individuality and creativity of primitive society. Simultaneously, the connections between different cultural groups have been investigated and their relationships to the more powerful centres of culture have been established, no matter how far removed they might be in time and space. As an art historian specializing in the study of Melanesian Art, I have been closely related to such approaches as were defined as early as in 1927 by my teacher, Professor J. Strzygowski, at the University of Vienna, and Professor von Heine- Geldern who have found affinities in the artistic expression of the Bronze Age in Europe, the Chou Art in China, Dongson influences, and influences from Indian Art Centres via Indonesia to the Pacific Area. Recently, Douglas Fraser has ex- pressed similar strong views - the views of a diffusionist - in his book " Primitive Art " in 1962, and more so in his publication " The Many Faces of Primitive Art ; a critical anthology ", in 1966. In his study " The Heraldic Woman ", Douglas Fraser stated most clearly how one could prove one's point most poignantly, using all evidence provided by myth, history, linguistics, anthropology and ethnology. But most important of all is the apparent and striking similarity in type, the use of symbols and motifs by peoples living in areas as remote as Easter Island is from the mainland of Asia. For the facility to conducting this research at the Australian Museum, I thank the Director, Dr. F. H. Talbot, the Trustees and also Mr. David Moore, Curator of Anthropology, who was always ready to listen to my problems and who gave me his time so freely, the librarian Miss M. Davis, the photographer Mr. C. V. Turner, and all the members of the staff, who were always ready to assist me. I am further indebted to Professor A. P. Elkin, editor of A.P. A.O. and his secretary, Mrs. B. Dunne, for their great help in publishing this paper. I also thank Professor D. Fraser, Columbia University, New York, and Dr. P. H. Lewis, Curator of Primitive Art and Melanesian Ethnology of the Field Muesum of Natural History, Chicago, who advised me on recent Literature. Introduction Although New Ireland is a small island compared with New Guinea, it shows a remarkable complexity in its art production, especially in the northern part, where the malanggan carvings originated, which are the subject of this study. In the</page><page sequence="2">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 135 southern part of the island we find the chalk and tuff figures, quite different in style, and in the middle part the Uli figures which show some affinities to both groups. The latter, about which very little is known and which are the smallest and most closely knit group, are included in this study. In this article I deal mostly with objects in the extensive collections from New Ireland at the Australian Museum in Sydney, the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne and the Queensland Museum in Brisbane. The surroundings in which a native artist lives undoubtedly play an essential part in his work ; he depends on it for the materials which he uses, while the local fauna and flora help him give a special flavour to the objects he creates. Influences from outside his native land are transformed to fit local conditions. The natives are excel- lent observers of birds and their movements : they imitate these in their dances (e.g. in the dances of the cassowaries and owls) and in the naturalistic representations of parrots and other birds, of different types of fish, and of floral motifs. Human and anthropomorphic beings, such as ghosts and ancestors, on the other hand, are given in a symbolic, tradition-bound and unrealistic manner. In this study I try to find out to what extent influences from earlier traditions and subsequent waves of migration still survive, what has been added and what is due to local individualistic artists. With the help of myth, the comparison of motifs from surrounding island groups and the knowledge accumulated by other scientists, I hope to present a clearer picture of the New Ireland Malanggan Carvings, up to now, their place in the diverse art styles of Melanesia has been very puzzling. New Ireland is part of the Bismarck Archipelago, and, together with New Britain, forms kind of an arch open towards the west, facing the north-eastern part of New Guinea. It is a long narrow stretch of land extending in a south-easterly direction between longitudes of 150 to 154 degress, three degrees south of the Equator. Geographically and ethnically, two small island-groups - the Tubar and the Simberi Islands - approximately 40 miles north from the coast of Middle New Ireland, are included in this survey. Fauna and flora are consistent with tropical conditions. The main islands were probably known to Spanish navigators as early as 1595, and were believed to be part of New Guinea. Philip Cateret rectified the mistake in 1767 and gave the islands the name of New Ireland and New Britain respectively. But not before the 19th century did the native population come into closer contact with white people. These were mostly traders, whalers and recruiters, exploiting the natives in a most shameful way and arousing their hostile feelings. Around 1875, the first missionaries arrived, and in 1885 the Germans took possession of the islands officially. Trading posts, missions and coconut plantations quickly sprang up in the northern part of New Ireland, with Kavieng as the seat of the district commissioner. To this day, the southern part is much less cultivated by white people. After World War I, the Bismarck group of islands became part of a mandate of the League of Nations, and in 1919 they came under Australian administration (Bühler, 1948).</page><page sequence="3">136 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS The question of the ethnic origin of the population is very complicated : the New Irelanders are Melanesiane, meaning that the population consists mainly of three different racial groups : Pre-Austronesians, Austronesians and Indonesians. All these races migrated from south-east Asia via New Guinea, and intermingled to a degree with natives from other islands, so that the contemporary picture is one of fusion and great complexity. Social organization was loose. There existed two main groups or moieties, which consisted of a number of clans. " On Tabar each of the two moieties had up to three bird-totems ", says F. D. McCarthy (1945 : 397), land-eagle, sea-eagle and sea-gull, were for one moiety, and fish-hawk, parrot and black scrub-hen were the other. Beside these, each possessed also sacred totem centres - or marsalai - places on the beach or rocks, where, supposedly, the spirits of the dead ancestors dwelled whose protection was sought against evil spirits " (Buehler, 1948 : 64). Around 1900, the Germans forced the native population to abandon their villages in the mountainous interior of the island, and compelled them to live on the coastal plains, in order to have better control over them and also to obtain a supply of labourers for their plantations. By forcing them to live on the coast and in a special type of huts - elevated from the ground - many of the original living conditions were changed, and a great deal of the former culture was destroyed. One of the first German settlers to introduce coconut plantations was Richard Parkinson, author of the once famous book : 30 Jahre in der Südsee (Stuttgart, 1907). He showed a special interest in the artefacts, habits and religious customs of the natives, and we can thank him that many objects which would otherwise have been lost, found their way to German museums. Thanks are due to him and his collaborators also for such excellent publications as " Publikationen aus dem königlichen Museun zu Dresden " edited by Dr. Α. Β. Meyer, as early as 1889. (These will be called " Dr. Pubi. " hereafter and are the most important source of information.) Parkinson, in his methodical way, also noted the village or place where he bought or collected the artefacts, whilst most traders, when selling their collections, could never give any information in this regard. The collection of carvings from New Ireland in the Australian Museum was bought in the main from Captain Richard Farrell in 1887 and from his widow in 1892. Farrell was associated with Parkinson and worked with him for many years, establishing plantations and carrying the products to Australia (R. W. Robson, 1965). As both men operated mostly on the East Coast of the northern and middle part of New Ireland, the carvings they collected also came from these parts of the islands and from the nearby islands of the Tabar and Simberi groups, in German times called " Gardner and Fischer Islands ". They show a variety of shapes, forms and motifs, but lest we get a false impression of the art production of New Ireland as a whole, I shall try to give as complete a picture as possible of the latter, by including artefacts from other collections which came from different sources. The great difficulty lies in the fact that most museum registers give no other information than the year the object was acquired, and hardly any evidence of the locality it came from.</page><page sequence="4">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 137 Therefore, stylistic characteristics have to be the guiding factor in establishing the local style as far as this is possible. Malanggan festivities have been well described in several publications ; e.g. G. Peekel, Antkropos, 1929: 1067; R. Linton and P. S. Wingert, 1946 : 159-162; F. D. McCarthy, 1946 : 54 ; A. Buehler, 1948 : 82-85 ; W. C. Groves, Oceania, 1934/5 · 347 i A· Kaeppler, /. P. Soc, Vol. 72, 1963 : 125, and others. The term " Malanggan Carvings " comprises the whole output of carvings produced for the Malanggan ceremonies, and as such almost the whole art production of New Ireland and the adjacent island groups of Tobar and Simberi. These artefacts fall into three distinct categories : (1) Masks ; (2) Posts (called " Totok ") and three-dimensional human figures and animals ; (3) Bas-reliefs and carved boards. Many of the carved posts have a name, but it is not quite clear whether the name stands for the design as such, or for a special carving. G. Peekel (1927 : 17) reports that there are two types of Malanggan carvings : the historical or personal and the mythological. It is quite possible, therefore, that the name belongs to the personal carving, carved in memory of a dead person, and not to the design. The motifs used in the carvings show the natives, their ancestors and the creatures of their surroundings, mostly birds, fish, snakes and lizards ; the painted motifs, however, consist mainly of floral and geometric patterns. Wood used for the carvings came from the trunk of the Alstonia Scholaris tree or the Alstonia Villosa, a soft, light material, easy to carve, yet very fragile and prone to rot in a humid climate (Peekel, 1929 : 1067). Other products of native skill were basketry and bags made from palm leaves, rattan, raffia and twisted fibres. Clothing was provided from leaves, and little aprons were made from strings. Body ornaments show great skill and clever use of all kinds of materials, such as shells, teeth of sharks, pigs and dogs, seeds and feathers. Ornamented forehead bands, belts, arm-rings, shell rattles and necklets are known to exist in great variety. In contrast to this rather primitive material culture, the complex, elaborate production of religious carvings used at Malanggan ceremonies is on the highest level of accomplishment. The wood-carvings show very great technical skill, an exceedingly high degree of perception in planning such complicated images - mostly carved in one piece, and a very great gift of fantasy. In the choice of themes, the artists were bound by tradition, but great freedom was accorded to the individual carver in the details, the use of additional materials and also the choice of colours and painted motifs to achieve the desired effect. The right to produce special types was the personal property of the carver or of his family, and could be bought from him to be used at another year's festivity. 1. Masks All " primitive people ", no matter where they live, attach great importance to masks. African Negroes, Red Indians of North America and Canada, and most of the peoples in the South Pacific area produce a great variety of them. Masks were also known in many European and Asian countries. D</page><page sequence="5">138 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS In New Ireland masks have been worn to represent the reincarnated spirits of the recent dead at dances commemorating the life of the ancestors. These masks in all their diversity, consist mainly of three different types, although masks from one group often show features of masks from other groups : A - helmet masks ; Β - owl masks ; C - composite masks. As it is not possible to describe in detail every piece, I will try to describe the characteristics of each group and mention some of the more important varieties and deviations from the typological norm as they may occur. (Numbers, if not indicated otherwise, refer to the inventory numbers of the Australian Museum.) A. Helmet masks There are two types of helmet masks, those with crests and those without. Helmet masks, called tatanua, according to Parkinson (1907, p. 648), served as mourning masks, and were worn at dances performed at the Malanggan celebrations honouring the ancestors and dead relatives of the tribe. The crested helmet masks derived their name from the large median crest of yellow fibres that covers the head from the base of the nose to the nape of the neck, whilst the sides of the head are painted white or covered with lime paste. The crested helmet masks imitate the mourning hair-do frequently seen on young men in former times. The faces represented in these masks strive to portray the male beauty ideal (R. Parkinson, 1907: 642). Even if we accept Parkinson's explanation, the impression of the masks is far from naturalistic. The secrecy associated with their carving shows that they are meant to bestow special powers on the wearer. The large yellow crest looks quite impressive and occupies two-thirds of the whole mask, while only one-third is taken up by the face proper. This consists of a narrow forehead, often decorated with a painted ornamented band ; eyes set in hollow crescents, filled with Turbo-shéìl operculum ; a keen projecting nose with wide nostrils, and a large, aggressive, square mouth, slightly open, with two rows of pointed teeth. Another characteristic is that there is no chin. The masks are carved in open work, enabling the wearer to see, and they are elaborately painted in black, white, red and - in some cases - also yellow and blue.1 The ears aie merely indicated and end in a handle-like feature, extending far below the lower jaw. This describes one of the most typical examples of a crested helmet mask, but there is great variety in the way a crested hair-do may be done over a rattan frame-work, and the treatment of the sides of the head also varies a great deal. Masks E557 and E554 show an ornamented zone of light-brown and white fibres as the basis of the yellow crest ; whilst one side of the head is covered with bleached fibres, the other consists of rows of parallel crests of yellow and brown fibres surrounding a large oval eye, bordered by a rim of red European cloth, pleated grass ropes, and white lime plaster or paste. E546 and E553 are interesting examples because they show the characteristics of another type of mask, also belonging to group A : the helmet mask without crest. 1 Painted motifs and colours are dealt with in a later chapter.</page><page sequence="6">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 139 The right side of E553 consists of straight bleached fibres, and is characteristic of this second type of mask, where the hair-do is also helmet-shaped, whilst the left side is covered with short stems of pith or twigs, stuck in a mixture of lime paste. Some helmet masks are evenly covered with these materials. E557 shows - on one half - characteristics of the second group of helmet masks and - on the other half - features of group Β : the owl masks. Not much is known about the origin of the crested helmet mask or the special hair-do they imitate, except that it took up to six months to grow the hair-do, and that in later times prople preferred to make masks of that shape to wear at the dances performed at the Malanggan ceremonies. If, however, one looks further afield in the Pacific area, one finds that helmets - not masks - are known from the Hawaiian Islands. In " Reports of the 3rd voyage ", Vol. 3, p. 137, ill. 64, London, 1784, Captain James Cook illustrates one from the Sandwich Islands. It closely resembles the crested helmet mask from New Ireland, but it consists of a basketry-work frame, covered with feathers of different colours, in the same way as the helmet masks' crests are built, with parallel rows of coloured fibres. Captain Cook mentions the possibility that the helmets worn by Spanish seafarers, who came to these islands in the 16th century, might be the prototype of these feather helmets. A. B. Meyer, (1889 : 14), also observed the similarity between New Ireland helmet masks and the Hawaiian feather-helmets, and mentions Captain Cook's remarks. But on pl. 67 of the abovementioned 3rd voyage, Captain Cook illustrates the figure of a God of War, also done in basketry-work covered with feathers, wearing the same type of crested helmet, indicated only by a kind of solid half-circle above his head. J. Guiart (1964 : 400) also illustrates a wooden carving from the same islands. It is the goddess Pele on a comb, clearly showing her head and, above it, the half- circle studded with a crest of wooden spikes. In ill. 401, Guiart shows another God of War, done in basketry and feathers, with a crested hair-do or helmet. There is in the Australian Museum in Sydney a figure from Hawaii showing the same crested hair-do as the New Ireland masks, and D. Fraser (1962 : Fig. 122) illustrates another War God from Hawaii with the same crest as the goddess Pele. Crested helmets are well-known from early Greek times, being frequently represented in Greek art. The idea that Greek motifs might turn up in the Pacific, is not to be discarded lightly, after studying the thorough work of Douglas Fraser, " The Heraldic Woman ", 1966, where there is clear evidence that ideas and modes of representation can turn up in such distinct places as Etruskia, Luristan, China, New Guinea, New Ireland, New Zealand and South America : if the basic beliefs are the same or are transferred, one finds a similar way of art expression. One could think, however, that the crest of the Greek helmet gave greater protection to the head of the wearer, and that the same idea occurred in the Pacific, too. In New Ireland no helmets are worn, but one could surmise that in helmet masks ancient traditions were kept alive, and that either the same hypothesis - that Spaniards were responsible for introducing this type of helmet in the Hawaiian Islands - is also</page><page sequence="7">140 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS related to New Ireland, where the Spaniards arrived around 1595 - as mentioned above - or that Polynesians wearing this type of helmet might have landed in New Ireland during their chance voyages to or from Polynesia.2 B. Owl Masks R. Parkinson in 1895, as well as the missionary G. Peekel in 1923, mentioned that they were present at the performance of owl dances, where the dancers wore such masks and covered their bodies with leaves. (See also F. D. McCarthy, 1946, p. 54) The owl, though not a totem bird of New Ireland, is nevertheless frequently represented in Malanggan carvings, especially on carved boards and in masks, which show the characteristics of these birds. E539 (ill. McCarthy, 1946 : 54) represents such a mask. The whole head is covered with brownish fibres, and only the space for a large eye is left free on each side. This space is painted white, and the eye is set in, in a diagonal direction, and surrounded by red paint. On top of the owl's head a crested bird is perched with large wings, painted in white and red. Handle-like ears are fitted on each side (probably for the dancer to hold the mask) . But not all owl masks are so naturalistic- ally shaped as the one just described ; others show some of the features, such as large, diagonal or round eyes and a beak-like nose. Then there is a distinct group of masks, all showing the same characteristics : two curved, framed square zones, filled with specific ornaments and separated by a median ridge. I am not sure that these masks represent owls as most of them have horn-like ears growing out of the back of the head, and some show a small snout-like mouth.3 But they have features which are by no means human. E384 shows a hair-do consisting of a rattan-framed pointed oval, filled with dark-brown fibres, protruding over the forehead. The queerest feature is a kind of nose-piece fitted onto the beak-like nose showing a combination of bird-fish-snake mofifs. Underneath the nose-piece is a small mouth with teeth holding a fish head. Some of the masks show, in addition, carved ear-pieces. The zone around the eyes is filled with a design consisting of banana-like oblong shapes, mostly in pairs. Sometimes these are so cleverly arranged around the eye that at the four corners, where they meet, the ground shows the distinct design of a small black fish. Some of these masks are made from wood, others consist of a rattan framework covered with bark-cloth. The turbo shell eyes sometimes have carved eyelids (see Dr. Pubi. Vol. X, Taf. II/4 and Vol. XIII, Taf. XIV/8, 15, and Parkinson, 1907, ill. 118). This type of owl-face is also frequently seen on totok figures (J. Guiart, 1964, ill. 285) which are discussed later on. These figures look as if they were wearing masks. 2 Andrew Sharp, " Ancient Voyagers in the Pacific ", Sydney, 1963, believes that chance voyages from the West were the source of population in the different island groups, but that voyages in an eastern direction also took place from one island group to the other. 8 W. Foy (1900 : 32) describes these masks as having developed either from cock's heads or fish.</page><page sequence="8">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 141 Some of the masks show peg-shaped eyes, or eyes carved in the shape of a fish- head with a mouth full of teeth protruding from the face for five inches, a small protruding mouth and elongated ears at the back of the head (E3484). Others have elaborate ear-pieces instead of ear-like horns (see Wingart and Linton, 1946, illustra- tion p. 159). R. Parkinson (1907 : 644) reports that masks with ear-pieces are called " Kepong " and that they are not used at dances, but worn by relatives of the dead persons in whose memory the Malanggan festivités are held. The men wearing these masks go from house to house collecting shell money for the feast. The Australian Museum in Sydney possesses quite a number of these masks* showing a wide variety of features, but basically belonging to the same type. One of the queerest and most complicated masks is E564, purchased from Captain Farrell in 1887. It has all the characteristic features, such as the square face, the banana- shaped design with the small black fishes in the corners, and a very complicated nose- piece which is discussed later on (p. 153). It also has the large ear-pieces - elaborately carved - and a large fish-head protruding from its mouth, and on top of the mask a crested hair-do like E564 and a similar mask E348. Most owl masks are connected with fish- like mask E564- with fish-shaped eyes - like E3484- or with the totok figures either standing on a fish, or - like E3321 - with a similar type of fish on the top of the head. Even the carved board, E3322 - showing two of these masks or owl-heads, ends in fish-heads (see F. D. McCarthy, 1945: 591). Masks with ear- pieces are also found in Bornea, and they, too, show the peg-shaped protruding eyes, a large mouth full of teeth, and a beak-like nose (D. Fraser, 1962 : Fig. 82). Peg-shaped eyes are also seen on one of the owl-faced masks in the Australian Museum (E3484), which resembles in type, mask E3487, and on a painted wooden figure from South China from the end of the Chou period, showing a large tongue, big peg-shaped eyes and a large mouth full of teeth biting a black snake which the figure holds in his hands (Fraser, 1962 : Fig. 98). These similarities of New Ireland masks and Chinese motifs are of great importance, as we shall find them in many more instances. Holding a snake in the mouth or beak or in the hands is one of the main motifs in New Ireland Malanggan carvings. The owl, in a more naturalistic representation, is found in China on sacrificial bronze vessels from the S'hang period (1600-1050 b.c.) in the shape of an owl, or more symbolically represented in the shape of a vessel of rounded contours with two owls' heads as lids. These owls have large round eyes, a beak - like some of the owl masks from New Ireland- (see Dr. Pubi. Vol. VII, Taf. XIII/2), and horn-like features emanating from the head, but flat and ornamental, fitted to the shape of the vessel. The representation of feathers is also to be found in a similar way on New Ireland carvings. Owl-shaped pottery jars also exist in New Guinea (Guiart, 1964, ill. 161 from the Middle Sepik). There are also many more examples found on New Guinea masks with peg-shaped eyes, and also of human-like heads from other island groups in the South Pacific (D. Fraser, 1962 : 55) and from Borneo. Small, snout-like mouths are found on masks from New Guinea, Taraway. (Dr. Pubi. Bd. Vii/Taf. VII.)</page><page sequence="9">142 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS C. Composite Masks I call " Composite Masks " those which combine features of several types of masks and also show motifs which we find on "totoks" and poles (next chapter) These new elements comprise anthropomorphic beings, lizards, snakes, birds, fishes, feathers, tendrils, and nose and ear-pieces in a wide variety of combinations. Some of these masks are so complex in appearance and so intricately carved that they defy description. The faces on them are human-like and naturalistic, and show less grossly distorted features, but are hidden behind so many additional painted and carved ornamental accessories that they are hardly visible. Mask E3483 shows an almost human face ; only the very wide-open mouth, with two rows of pointed teeth, defies this definition. A black tongue, square and shaped like an axe-blade, protrudes from the mouth, and a similar black object is seen protruding from the forehead. There exist numerous similar masks, all of the same type, showing that strange black object in the mouth and on the forehead (see Dr. Pubi. Vol. X, Taf. I/i and Taf. II/i, 2, where similar masks are illustrated, all described as originating on Fisher, respectively Simberi Islands. J. Guiart (1964 : ill. 291) shows a mask with a face carved in open work, the black objects in mouth and on forehead, large boar tusks, ear-pieces and elaborately carved horns with zig-zag snakes and leaf motifs ; also from Fisher Island). Mask E3483, as well as the above-mentioned masks, shows a rattan-framed hair-do filled with fibres ; sometimes also whiskers are fitted to the corners of the mouth. The whole head is surrounded by a network of tendrils, one on each side of the nose, emanating from a sort of chin, joined to the tongue-like objects in the mouth and on the forehead. Two tendrils emanate from the corners of the mouth, crossing the cheeks and form the continuation of the ears. They all combine above the hair-do and join in a kind of fish-head at the back of the head. All these tendrils and the masks proper are carved in one piece. Ear-pieces are missing, but one can see the place where they were once fitted, as ear-pieces are always carved separately and fitted on afterwards. I have described the network surrounding the face as " tendrils " because some of them show a painted pattern of leaves, and also because A. Buehler (1948 : 21) reports that " men from New Hanover carried tendrils or rods in their mouths, approximately half a metre long and bent in the shape of a U, the ends crossing the face and protruding above the head. The same decoration is also seen on masks from Τ abar and North New Ireland, In southern New Ireland men carried rotan bows (?) in their mouths with little bells made from shell attrached to them ". Other masks, belonging to this group, show a combination of snakes, lizards, fishes and birds (E564, E569, E572). One of the very heavy " matua " masks is E598, of which R. Parkinson (1907 : 644) reports that the relatives of the deceased person wear them on the day of the Malaggan celebrations, standing or kneeling in front of the house, where all the carvings are exhibited. A carving in the Australian Museum (E609) shows a boar's head as the basis for an anthropomorphic being, consisting of a head, on which a bird</page><page sequence="10">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 143 is perched, and the upper part of the body with arms holding on to a network of tendrils, and a bird emanating from the boar's head below. (See also Dr. Pubi. Vol. VII, Taf. IX/ia, b, where a woman giving birth is suspended upside-down above a large head forming the mask.) Summary As complicated and unusual as these " composite masks " may be, they all show features, especially in the faces that we find on the posts and carved human figures, which will be discussed in the next chapter. We find the aggressive physiognomy and the open work of the helmet masks, the owl faces with all their attributes, such as horns, round and diagonal eyes, the framework with the special filling of banana-like shapes, and the little black fishes in the corners. We also find the more compact faces with rather naturalistic features on some of the composite masks. The com- bination of boar-tusks, snakes, lizards, birds and fishes, the network of tendrils and feathers also appear on the posts as also do some of the painted ornaments and colour combinations, and the turbo-shéü eyes. Open-work symmetric compositional perceptions are common to most New Ireland carvings, with the exception of those figures, where the position of the arms and hands varies. Although quite complicated and bizarre masks are generally a feature of Melanesia, nowhere was anything resembling the big " matua " masks created. 2. Posts (called : Τοτοκ) and Three-dimensional Figures The discussion of " composite masks " leads to a second group of artefacts - the carved posts and three-dimensional figures. As a matter of fact, some of the composite masks are so big, heavy and complex that they look more like posts than masks. I call carving in the round which are peg-based, " posts " ; they are to be put into the ground and exhibited during the Malanggan celebrations in front of the special exhibition shed (see ill. in Buehler, 1962 : 122). They consist mostly of one or two human figures, one superimposed on the other, totem-pole fashion, surrounded by a network of tendrils, feather motifs, snakes, birds and fishes. Let us start with two figures of the simplest type - E524 and E1193, a male and a female figure, both naturalistically represented with very big heads. Each holds a snake which bites their chin. From their elbows a tendril reaches down to the base on which each stands, consisting of a small platform ending in a peg. The woman's head is square and solid, with a pointed cone on top of a square head-dress ; the ears are small and end in the usual handle-like feature touching the shoulders. Her eyes are part of a pattern decorating her face, the mouth is large and studded with teeth, and she wears a black square ring in her nose. She shows a kap kap painted between her breasts which are projecting and pointed. She wears an apron-like lap lap. The figure is painted mainly red with a little black and white. The male figure is similar in type ; his head is also squarish, more naturalistic than the woman's, and wears a flat crested helmet between two feathers emanating from the</page><page sequence="11">144 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS ears. His eyes are inserted turbo-shells and he, too, has a square ring through his nose. A large circular object is carved on his breast. Both the male and the female figures have straight legs ; the male figure is painted foremost black with a little white. A. Kraemer (1925 : Taf. 51) illustrates a similar male figure, which he identifies as a rain-maker. Our two carvings which are distinctly different from other totok figures, in so far as they are much more naturalistically carved, especially their bodies, have fewer attributes and they are both more human-like than the ordinary totok figures. There is no doubt that they represent a special type amongst the carved figures, and the Linden Museum in Stuttgart contains a similar male figure from New Ireland with a very big square head with a bird perched on top, a large toothy mouth, and a kap kap on the breast. It is also identified as a rainmaker. In E3327, the Australian Museum possesses another totok figure of more common type, more composite, with a wide squarish head, rather naturalistic, with a rattan- framed hair-do and two ear-like horns. The head is unpainted, apart from a bit of red around the eyes, the wide nostrils and the large mouth. A short neck leads to a body hidden behind a network of tendrils, birds and fishes, to which the hands hold on. The figure stands on a peg-based platform consisting of a bird of the same type as the one under the chin of the figure. A blaek snake follows the contours of the legs and bites the elbows. The face of E3327 corresponds to some degree with the similar big square heads seen on the figures in the famous boat of the Linden Museum, built in 1901 in Parui Village on the east coast of Middle New Ireland near Medina. (See H. Spiegel, 1971.) On my visit to Parui in July 1967, I saw four men engaged in carving a figure similar to E3327 ; but it was much simpler, coarser and not carved in one piece. The bird in front was carved separately and put on with nails, and the arms were added separately. A close examination, however, reveals a stylistic correspondence with the Dresden boat figures carved on Tabar Island (see Dresd. Pubi. Bd. XIII, Taf. Xl/ib), especially with the type of face. All boat figures show two small squares in relief on each side of the mouth to contain the whiskers, and the same are seen on the head of our figure, and there is also a similarity in the way the bird in front of the breast is represented, upside-down, with an oval shield-like pattern on its back. The way the features of the other birds are represented is also similar. In my opinion, our figure undoubtedly also comes from the Tabar Islands. There are also two other totok figures, E518 and E521, which show a close resemblance to the Dresden boat figures, although they have a different kind of head-dress. These two sculptures are almost identical and seem to be carved by the same hand. Both figures show the wide, brown faces so characteristic of the Dresden boat figures : the broad nose, the wide mouth full of teeth, the same hair-do, eye shape, tendrils emanating from their mouths, and boar tusks through the nose. But, in contrast to the boat figures, the tusks of our figures end in a little square near the eyes, decorated with a painted floral motif. The bodies are hidden behind a trace-work of tendrils, snakes, fish and bird motifs. The figures are peg-based</page><page sequence="12">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 145 in the same way as the boat figures which are inserted into openings in the boat. One of our figures, E518, carries earpieces ; on E521 they are missing, but one can see the slit where they once had been fixed. The earpieces are almost the same as on the boat figure id. In contrast to the previously discussed figure, E3327, which is a heavy solid carving, the last two mentioned are very delicately carved, with slender limbs and graceful ornaments. Both figures wear a kind of head-dress consisting of the frequently encountered ear-like horns, which one can also see on the boat figures, and two triangular, fish- jaw-shaped features. Between these features is a tree-shaped ornament, namely, a stem with two pairs of branches and some feather ornaments, and on top a little knob, painted white. The figures themselves are painted black with a little red and white. The jaw-like feature, topping the head of E518 and E521 is also to be seen on E3321, one of the most intriguing and striking carvings in the collection of the Australian Museum. This is a very heavy, peg-based carving, 1 -70 m. in height and 33 cm. in width, consisting mainly of a large, owl-type face with big round eyes, surrounded by the typical owl-face ornament, with the four little fishes in the corners, a very large mouth with teeth and a lolling tongue on which an undefined creature is painted. Under the tongue and emanating from the mouth is a kind of curved shield, decorated with rows of small fruit-like ornaments in bas-relief. A bird is also to be seen on this shield, biting the tongue. This queer head is topped by a jaw-like feature we have already seen on figures E518 and E521. Between the jaws a shark-like fish curves from the forehead to the back of the head, and on top of it sits a heavy bird, biting the back fin of the fish. The rear of the whole post is un- finished, ending in a peg. This post is remarkable in many ways. First of all, there exist - as far as I know - three more, almost identical pieces ; one is illustrated in Dr. Pubi. Bd. XIII, Taf. ΧΙ/2, from Gardner, resp. Tabar Island; it shows some differences in the formation of the eyes ; thus it has no bird on the shield-like feature under the lolling tongue, but it does show a similar design of an undefined creature on the tongue.4 Two more examples of this post can be seen, one in the British Museum in London and one in the Linden Museum in Stuttgart. The fish jaws on both these figures end in snake's heads with turbo shell inlaid eyes, and reach up to the bird wings. These four figures are so closely related that one could think of the same artist having carved all four. Then there is this puzzling feature of the shield under the tongue of all of them ; whilst the bird on top of the head, and the fish and the large owl-type face are commonly seen elements, this shield, ornamented with the special motif of rows of difficult-to-define objects, occurs only on a limited number of figures and a few masks - to my knowledge. What are these objects represented in rows ? They seem, most likely, to be fruits or pods, carved in bas-relief and painted white on our figure or red on the one represented in the Dr. Pubi. The figure of a rainmaker 4 To my mind, one of the most important carvings from Gardner (Tabar) Islands, published by W. Foy in 1900, probably collected in 1895.</page><page sequence="13">146 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS in the Linden Museum shows the same objects hanging from a belt he is wearing, so that I thought they might represent raindrops. But they could also be some sort of small shells, hanging on a rattle, as are seen in Middle New Ireland (Bühler, 1948 : 22). This idea is supported by the example of a totok figure from the Voklerkunde Museum in Vienna where a human figure, wearing the type of owl-mask we have seen in many examples, shows underneath the projecting tongue an object decorated with the fruit or shell ornament which he holds in one of his hands (the second arm is missing). A similar figure is seen in J. Guiart (1964 : Fig. 285). Both figures stand on a fish of the same type, and show the same type of masked head with the ear-like horns, and snakes biting their elbows. A similar figure, without bird on head, standing on a human head is in the Australian Museum, E14318 and in the National Gallery of Victoria No. 12855. The same type of owl face with the shield underneath is also found on mask E563. In this mask a nose piece covers the beak-like nose, and a long thin tongue reaches from the small snout-like mouth down across the shield. The flat rattan- framed hair-do is topped by the usual large ear-like horns. Another totok figure is E1190, showing the same shield-like feature under the chin, crossed by the lolling tongue. W. Foy (1900 : 36/7) does not know either how to explain this puzzling feature in a satisfactory way, although he relates it to tendrils decorated with similar fruit-motifs, which some of the figures carry in their mouths. There are three very interesting totok figures in the Australian Museum, rather coarsely carved, probably by the same carver. Two of these, E3331 and E3330, are female figures, peg-based, holding the tips of their breasts with their hands. A black zig-zag snake bites their chins and a fish puts its teeth in the tail of the snake. Snakes also bite their elbows, and a painted necklet is seen around their necks. But the most remarkable feature is that they wear masks which almost hide their faces. E3331 shows a white modified owl mask without the usual ornaments, just showing a slit where the nose piece might have been inserted once, a wide mouth full of teeth, no chin, and a beard covering the lower part of the face. This mask covers the upper part of the head, reaching down to the eyes of the figure. E3330 is an almost identical female figure, only the mask covering the head is different. It consists of a naturalistic red face with wide nose, feathers on ears and whiskers on both sides of the mouth. Both figures and masks have glass pieces inserted as eyes instead of the usual turbo-shell covers. E3329 (PI. I(b)) is a remarkable carving in so far as it shows a figure standing on a fish (there is no peg), and, instead of arms, two jaw-like triangular features reach down from the shoulders to the figure's hips ; a snake on each side bites the pointed ends of these triangles. A bird hangs upside-down from the mouth of the figure whose face is hardly visible because it is hidden behind the wide red tongue of the owl mask that the figure wears on its head. It is a characteristic owl mask with diagonal eyes, the banana-shaped ornaments, the little fishes in the corners, a ridge instead of a nose- which divides the face of the mask in the two t'ao-t'ieh-like parts, with a wide mouth full of teeth, and a beard. On top of it, the same fish-jaw-like</page><page sequence="14">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS.

Yellow fibres cover the crown of the mask. This figure, too, has glass pieces inserted instead of the usual turbo-shell eyes. A very interesting post, E1191, is exhibited in the new Melanesian Gallery of the Australian Museum. It is peg-based and shows a bewhiskered, large, rather naturalistic head, covered with a rattan-framed fibrous hair. The eyes are unusual in shape, not the usual half-circle, but oval-shaped. There is the wide mouth with teeth, large vertical boar-tusks and whiskers. Underneath the mouth is a squatting human figure, upside-down, holding its ears in its hands. It has a round face with a small round mouth and no teeth. On top of the main head an upside-down frigate bird is seen flanked by fishes, with long black tail feathers, which frame another anthropomorphic being, similar to the one underneath the large head. It has the same type of head as the small figure underneath. A large bird of the type seen on post E3321 sits on the crouching figure's back. Its beak is open and communicates with a bird, also with open beak, sitting on the crouching human figure's head. There are three more almost identical posts, only a bit smaller, in the store of the Australian Museum : E1186, 1187, 1188.5 The Queensland Museum in Brisbane possesses one of the most interesting posts - quite different from the usual compositions of one or more human figures superimposed on top of each other and some birds, fish or lizards and snakes in addition. The Queensland post (E4524, collected before 1890) is peg-based and shows a large human head with boar tusks through the nose and big mouth and, above a flat hair-do, supported by eight cones are three platforms on top of each other in wedding-cake fashion. A middle pole runs through all three platforms and is richly decorated with a black ornament, surrounded by white on a red ground, whilst the cones are painted white with black tips. The third platform is crowned by two birds facing each other. The whole pole is delicately carved, slender and graceful. This post is similar in type and style to a heavy, very imposing sculpture, also from the Queensland Museum (E4251 : PI. I (a)), in which the same motif of platforms is used, above a heavy head, crossed by a black snake. This extraordinary carving is topped by a human or monkey-like being, crouching on knees and elbows on the supporting cones, and showing two tails ! This queer creature is similar in type to one shown on a memorial board from Fisher (Simbari) Island, illustrated in Dr. Pubi. Bd. X, Taf. XII/2, but I have found no parallel so far to the two last-mentioned carvings. The ornament, however, which I mentioned decorating the middle pole, is quite frequently found on other New Ireland carvings. Two figures from the British Museum (84.7-28.4 and 84.7-28.2, bought 1884) (PI. I (c)) show it on the thighs of these figures and on a bird suspended upside-down in front of the breast of a male and a female, standing on a large fish head. Both figures are richly decorated with various painted motifs and a carved network of tendrils and birds. The fish head * A similar totok is illustrated by C. W. Mead : Americ. Mus. J. 8, 1908, p. 38, where a carving is seen leaning against a " Taboo or Ghose House in the Bismarck Archipelago " : Photo E. Schröder.</page><page sequence="17">148 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS is also beautifully decorated and shows large eyes inlaid with turbo shells and raised eye-lids, and big boar tusks joining on to a middle ridge between the eyes. The ornament mentioned above consists of the design, in black ,of a vertical stem, crossed by horizontal bars, surrounded by white paint on a red background ; it is very effec- tive. The male figure has rather naturalistic features ; the female has hardly human features, whilst the body is naturalistically shaped. She has long, projecting breasts which she holds with her hands, a kap kap design between her breasts, and a bird upside-down suspended from her chin showing on its back the characteristic cross design. The male and the female figure show a very great affinity and might have been carved by the sane artist. There are also two other figures (84 -7-28 «1/9) of similar type and closely related to the two above-mentioned, and also the figure of a young girl standing on a fish head (1938, 10-31-2), only much simpler and coarser. A similar figure of a young girl in a fish's mouth is illustrated in Dr. Pubi. Bd. X, Taf. XVII/i from 1883. She wears a pointed head-dress and holds her hands under- neath her breasts. Another figure is swallowed up to the shoulders by a large fish head (ill. in Dr. Pubi. Bd. X, Taf. XVII/4) and a similar small figure (E1188), also up to its shoulders in the jaws of a fish, holds the extended ends of his ears in his hands. A similar figure is illustrated by A. Krämer, 1925, from the Hamburg Voelkerunde Museum. Each of these figures shows an invividual touch but none of them is unique. There is also quite a recent carving in the Port Moresby Museum, of a man standing on a fish and extending his right hand, and with this figure goes the story that a man was drowned on the way home from Tabar Island and was swallowed up by a fish. This figure was carved to be used at the memorial ceremonies. It seems that all these figures standing on fish heads or being swallowed by fish are victims of sharks or other fish, and the extended right arm also seems to indicate a victim of some fatal accident as the figures in the Dresden boat show, who also have their right arm extended, holding a small paddle. Of the ten figures in the Stuttgart boat, three are given with an outstretched right arm. The habit of representing human figures in the jaws of animals is not confined to New Ireland, as a beautifully carved wooden figure from the Admiralty Island (E26927 in the Austr. Mus.) shows : in this a crocodile head extending vertically from a round base holds a human figure up to its navel in its jaws. How far has the motif of an anthropomorphic being on a fish head, or a crocodile, a wider meaning than being the representation of an accidental death is very difficult to establish. Several interpretations have been tried, but none has given a satis- factory answer to this question. F. Speiser, 1934 : 128 ; G. Willitsch, 1935 : 331 ; and G. Peekel, 1927 : p. 19, give different explanations. This question will be considered more closely in the second part of this paper. AU the carvings discussed so far in this chapter seem to be connected with the Malanggan ceremonies or with the decoration of the cult houses, or they might have some special meaning that is hidden because of our inadequate knowledge of the stories or myths behind them. This is shown by the mask-type features of their faces, their attributes, ear, nose and mouthpieces. But the four figures I shall discuss now seem</page><page sequence="18">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 149 to represent ordinary persons in a more naturalistic manner, with few contortions and resembling some of the sculptures of ordinary human beings from the Solomon Islands. The first is a small, heavy, almost cubistic male figure, E62894, from the Aus- tralian Museum, carrying a spear in his right hand, unfortunately the left is missing. The face is unusual and individualistic in so far as it has a very broad, flat nose under a narrow forehead ; the head-dress is also unusual, consisting of four feather-like shapes on a base, decorated with an eye motif. A wide tongue, also decorated with an eye motif, projects from a large mouth. The figure shows some ornaments on its breast which frame the shoulder area. The lower abdomen is painted white and also the large projecting penis. The feet are heavy and block-like, and show five toes each, whilst there are only three fingers and a thumb on the right hand. E583, the figure of a man, and E582, a woman, seem to represent a couple, and show great affinity in the way they are carved (D. Moore, 1968). Both are rather small, 2' feet high, and they are without the extra attributes, such as birds, fish or tendrils. Only a few ornaments are painted on their faces and bodies. They both have large hçads covered with a light-coloured spongy material for hair, elongated ears, ending in the usual triangular loop, touching the shoulders and protruding above the head with a feather ornament. The man is unusual in that his right leg is bent at an angle at the knee and held up while he stands on the left leg. His face shows overmodelled lips which give him a lively expression. He has a high forehead and whiskers. The female figure is also unusual ; she seems to be giving birth and is represented holding her elongated right breast with her right hand whilst the left hand seems to help the child emerge from the womb. Her legs are slightly apart, and the left foot shows three large claw-like toes and the right foot four toes. Her face shows no expression but her large mouth is without teeth, and she has a wide nose, a distinct chin, some simple ornaments painted on her cheeks, and shell inlaid eyes under a painted fore- head band. In addition she has some quite usual painted ornaments on her breast, a painted belt on her body and ornaments on her abdomen and legs. It seems that both figures were carved by the same artist, and both were acquired through Captain Farrell in 1887. Another unusual figure from the Australian Museum, E597 (see H. Spiegel : 1967) is that of a woman giving birth to an infant who has partly emerged from her womb, and whose head, body and arms are visible. This figure is also very realistically represented, without attributes. She has a large head with inlaid eyes, a wide nose, a big mouth full of teeth, and an unusual pointed head-dress - delicately painted - a kind of rain-cap worn by the women in New Ireland. Her breasts are large and prominent with a kap kap painted between them and a floral ornament carved in relief. Her arms are hanging down and her thin legs are slightly apart. She is giving birth to an infant which has almost completely emerged from her womb. It has a large head with the usual extended ears, red hair, a big mouth, outstretched arms, a body, but no legs. Mother and child are of dark-brown colour, richly decorated with painted ornaments in bright colours of white, blue, red and yellow.</page><page sequence="19">150 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS Childbirth seems to be quite an important event in New Ireland, and A. Buehler (1948 : Abb. 10) reports that a special house was erected for the pregnant wife of a chief in Logagon, north-east New Ireland, and that it was richly decorated with anthropomorphic beings with heads of the owl mask type and bodies in squatting position. Two more instances of childbirth are mentioned in the Dr. Pubi. Bd. VII/IX/i, 2, i88ç),e but none is represented as realistically as our figure. There is another reference in the Dr. Pubi., 1895, Bd. X, p. 2 and 10, where R. Parkinson mentioned that a complicated structure of horizontal and vertical carved posts and boards was erected as a monument in memory of a chieftain's wife who died in childbirth, topped by a large carved figure of the woman in childbirth, and that this figure is now in Sydney. It seems, therefore, quite possible that our figure E597 in the Australian Museum is the one mentioned by R. Parkinson in 1895. There is also a very interesting figure in the Vienna Völkerkunde Museum, No. 64313, acquired in 1895, standing on a crescent, clad in a long, elaborately- painted gown, showing no legs and giving birth to an infant whose head has emerged (see H. Spiegel, 1967). The woman has a large head, regular features, large eyes, and elongated ears. Her hands hold on to tendrils in front of her body, snakes hang down from her elbows, and a large kap kap is painted between her breasts. But the most remarkable feature are two wing-like protrusions emerging from her shoulders. For these I could find no parallel in New Ireland's imagery, but figures from the South Maprik district of New Guienea, also show the same wing-like features. They too, stand on a crescent. The wing-like features are characteristic of some of the South Maprik figures (see E. Haberland, 1965 : Abb. 25/26). Maprik carvings show many affinities with New Ireland carvings, as has previously been pointed out. The parallel of motifs, giving birth and standing on a crescent, is quite remarkable.7 Other features of the Vienna figure, such as the hair-line coming down in a curve on her forehead, are also to be seen on the South Maprik figure. A hair-line like this is also characteristic of an unusual carving from the British Museum (1927, ιο·ι8·ι). It is the figure of a man dressed in a kind of jacket, holding one of the New Ireland drums between his legs. His head shows similar features in the hair-line, the large eyes and the comb-like cap on his head. The features of the drummer seem to be over-modelled with resin and give him the same lively expression we have seen on the abovementioned male figure, E583. The Uli figures, which are described in the next pages, also show a similar hair-line and comb-like crested cap. G. Peekel (1929 : 1015) connects these figures with the moon cult, and the Maprik figure and the Vienna figure are standing on what I consider to be a crescent or half-moon. (A similar figure to the drummer, but without a drum, (E835) from the Queensland Museum, also stand on a crescent. A figure similar in style is in the Mus. of Prim. Art, New York, illustrated in Selected Works, 1957, fig. 10). The Australian Museum possesses three very tall posts, or masts, akin to the one illustrated by J. Guiart (1963 : ill. 36). They are approximately 16 feet high « And in Dr. Pubi. Bd. XIII ; W. Foy, p. 26. 7 See my article in Mankind, 1967 : p. 510, pl. 1.</page><page sequence="20">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 151 and of very elaborate carving. Two of them, E767 and E766, were - according to the register- sold to the Museum by Captain Farrell in 1887, and are supposed to have come from Gardner (Tabar) Island. These two are so closely related in style and execution that it is possible that both were carved by the same artist. Their stylistic relationship to the figures of the Dresden boat8 speaks for their origin from Gardner Island. The third post, E3333, bought from Mrs. Farrell in 1892, is somewhat different. It is not only carved from much heavier wood, but also shows a 4 ft.-long peg at the bottom, to be put well into the ground, and another small peg protruding from the head of the top figure, probably meant to be inserted into a slit on a horizontal log in support of a building. E767 has no peg and only the sequence of five upright figures, kneeling on the head of a large bird, shows that this carving was meant to be put up vertically. This post shows a fish head at the base, and on top of this a large bird of Gardner Island type. On its head the kneeling figure of a man is seen with hands holding onto a network of tendrils, rods and birds in open work, behind which the figure is hidden. All figures show large tusks fitted through their broad noses, dark faces and a hair-do made from little sticks. Their lips are protruding and rather small. On top of the head of the first figure sits a kind of bird, and on top of the bird the second figure. This motif is repeated five times. The eyes are given in the usual way. The birds, seen in front of the figures between the network of tendrils and rods, show the same pattern on their bodies as the birds given in front of the Dresden boat figures. A similar fish to the one seen as a base on the Dresden boat figure ic (Dr. Pubi. XIII, Raf. X/ic) is given at the base of the post, emanating from the large fish head. The post is painted in red, black and white. E 766 is also a very intricate and complex carving. It shows at the base a large fish head on to which is added a kind of spine with bones, framed by a narrow band. On to this is fitted a large human head, over-modelled, bewhiskered, dark-brown in colour, with a broad nose and a rattan-framed fibrous hair-do of the kind seen on the Dresden boat figures. Also, the tusks fitted through the nose are similar, as are the ears ending in loops. On top of the human head another fish head is seen with spiny body - as we saw it at the base - but this time painted red, whilst the first fish head is painted black. This motif is repeated a third time, and on top of the third fish head is seen a whole figure with a bird on top - of the type we saw on top of the large post E3321, probably also from Gardner Island. All these motifs are well hidden behind a network of rods, tendrils and birds. Colours are red, black and white. The painted motifs are similar to the ones seen on the Dresden boat figures. The motif of a fish head with added body consisting of a spine with bones is illustrated by G. Peekel (1929 : Fig. 18) ; it is a three-dimensional carving on its own. 8 The Dresden boat is a very good example of Gardner Island carvings collected before 1900. The four figures in the boat provide a number of carved and painted motifs which could be identified also on numerous other carvings, thus giving a kind of register of types documented in time and location. Not only the faces, but also the representation of birds, fish and snakes and many other details vary on the four figures.</page><page sequence="21">152 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS A similar piece, only with a boar's head, is in the Australian Museum, E3479, PI· H (a)· It is discussed later on. The post or support, E3333, with the long peg, melting into a fish head, is also spectacular and unusual : on top of the fish head a kneeling male figure is given, arms bent backwards, with a dark face, tusks in nose, and large ears. A bird, part of the complicated open-work network of tendrils and rods, bites the head of the kneeling figure.9 Another bird joins this upside-down bird by the tail, and this one is con- fronted by another bird. Still another is joined to its tail, pointing upwards, given only with a head and wings, biting a snake's tail. The snake bites the chin of a second anthropomorphic being, up to its chest in the jaws of another large fish head. This figure has a large square head with a wide mouth full of teeth and two upright tusks, a broad nose and ears ending in a loop. The head is fitted with a platform-shaped head-dress with painted feather motifs, and on top of this is seen another peg. The whole structure of this post is heavier than the two previously-mentioned ones, consistent with the theory that it was meant to support a high building and that it was a difficult task to carve it from the heavy wood. Though no origin is given in the register, I would connect this post with the carvings from Gardner (Tabar) Island. 3. Mouth, Nose and Earpieces Mouth, nose and earpieces are connected with special types of masks and figures in general, but there are always exceptions and no adherence to rules is apparent. These mask adornments are outstanding artefact, carvings in open work, mostly excellently composed, but not always related in style to the character of the mask or figure. Some, however, show the same bird perched on top of the mask represented again in the earpieces. See Dr. Pubi. Bd. X, Taf. I/3. Another example is the Dr. Boat figure, ie, where the little human figure in the earpiece corresponds in type and style with the main figure. Mouthpieces are mostly connected with the Tatanua or mourning dance masks, whilst nose pieces are only connected with the owl-type masks, and earpieces are seen on owl-masks as well as on M atua-masks and the complicated and very large composite masks. I call " mouthpieces " the various carvings that are carried in the mouth by the masks and are carved separately, but I don't include the upturned tongue or snakes and fish or birds which are sometimes seen on all types of masks, as on masks E572, where a lizard is seen climbing the network of tendrils emanating from the mouth of the mask, and similar motifs. Mouthpieces are held in the mouth of the Tatanua masks and are all of similar type. They consist of a horizontal base, sometimes in the shape of a snake or lizard, and on top of it is represented a bird with a very long beak, holding a snake either in its beak or with its claws, or an anthropomorphic being holds the feather-like long beak in its hands (Dr. Pub. Bd. VII, Taf. XII/i, 2). Other mouthpieces show an eye-feather-beak motif (Dr. Pubi. Bd. X, Taf. V/6, 7). • A kneeling figure is also seen on a Canadian totem pole in the Australian Museum.</page><page sequence="22">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 153 The same feather- or beak-like feature is held by a lizard perched on a mantis in a unique composition on a mouthpiece from the Austri. Mus. E479, illustrated by F. D. McCarthy, 1946 : 54. Another mouthpiece from the Australian Museum represents a bird-snake motif. Nosepieces Nose pieces are only seen in connection with the owl-masks and owl-type faces, wherever they appear, mostly on masks, rarely on whole figures. Often no nose is represented on faces of this type, just a median ridge dividing the two parts of the face (E3321) or a beak-like nose merged in the design or composition of the nosepiece, forming at the same time the body of the bird, which is the most frequently used motif. (See Dr. Pubi. Bd. X, Taf. II/4 and E3484, which also shows peg-eyes in the shape of a fish-head.) Other motifs on nosepieces are snakes and fishes and the long feather-like feature, as on mask E563. All these motifs are so intricately interwoven that it is hard to distinguish them. Earpieces These are masterpieces in their own right, adding to the fantastic character of the whole mask or figure which they adorn. They are always carved separately, and inserted in slits on the heads of the masks or figures. (Some earpieces are set in, at an angle, facing backwards or forward, though by far the majority are set in straight.) The earpieces are mostly carved in pairs, sometimes with slight variations, facing each other (E559). Sometimes, mainly when anthrophomorph beings are represented, they look straight ahead, as in the Dresden Boat Figure le, or are turned towards the centre, as in the magnificent M atua-mssks in the National Gallery of Victoria, E12856 and E32019, where a male figure carved in the round is seen on one earpiece and a female on the other. On masks E3487 a cockerel or cockatoo is carved in the round, facing ahead. The most frequently seen motifs on earpieces are birds, fishes and snakes or com- binations of bird-snake (E63150) or bird-fish motifs (masks E572) and human beings. Frequently feather motifes, ornamented bands and oblong and centric floral or sun motifs are also used. Another characteristic feature is stylization, as the motifs are mostly fitted into a framework of various shapes, pointed on top and on the lower end, and invariably ending in a loop (E569, 564, 559). To sum up the chapter on Mouth, Nose and Earpieces, one could find that mouth- pieces are connected with the helmet masks, whilst nosepieces only occur on owl masks. Earpieces, however, can be seen on all types of masks and figures, with the exception of the special figures in the round, which show individual human features, such as the woman in childbirth, the drummer, the man with the shark-trap, the rainmakers ; that is, figures which I consider altogether human. Neither mouth, nose or earpieces exist on the figures in the Stuttgart boat (see D. Fraser, 1962 : Fig. 93). Neither do they appear on anthropomorphic beings represented on carved boards, or those</page><page sequence="23">154 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS beings riding on fish, or on Uli figures. This could mean that carved nose and ear- pieces are a local variety, mostly from the Tabar and Simbari Islands, or that they are connected with a special kind of ceremony, where mostly owl masks are used. Further afield in other island groups, mouthpieces are worn by dancers in New Guinea, consisting of a piece of wood, decorated with little shells, carried in the mouth by the dancers, and fitted with a tongue-like annex, also covered with little shells. A skull, a head-hunting trophy with peg-eyes, covered with little shells and a queer kind of nosepiece, carved in wood, is seen in the Australian Museum from the delta of the Fly River in North East Papua (E27094). The long feather-beak-like feature, so often seen on mouth and nosepieces from New Ireland masks, exists also on carved birds from Indonesia. Carved earpieces are found on masks from Borneo (see D. Fraser, 1962 : Fig. 82). These are wooden masks with peg-eyes and boar-tusks from the Museum of Natural History, New York. * 4. Boards and Bas-reliefs Carved boards, in contrast to posts, are horizontal friezes, so to say, and serve as decorations of Mallanggan houses in the same way as posts. Whilst the main subject in posts was the anthropomorphic being, in boards mostly the animal world takes over. There are quite a number of boarcds, especially the smaller ones, where mostly birds and snakes are seen. See A14220, E1194, where a small squatting human figure is given on the left end of the board, and a stylized a-naturalistic bird, with elaborate tail-feathers and holding a snake in its claws and beak, occupies most of the space in an assymetric composition, whilst the right part is filled with the snake and a fill-work of tendrils. This carving is mostly done in open-work and partly carved in relief. Both sides are the same, one side unfinished with traces of (pencil) design, where the feathers are indicated in colours. Two very similar pieces are in the Linden Museum in Stuttgart - two more very elaborately carved and decorated, more sophisticated, asymétrie pieces are illustrated in Dr. Pubi. X, Taf. XIII/1-2 ; number 2 with a squatting human figure, chin in hands on the left end. Both boards show a rooster- like bird with a human head, cut off at the neck and facing upward, in its beak. The background is filled with very delicate open-work carvings of floral motifs. Number 1 is supposed to have come from Simberi Island. Another example from the Australian Museum is E9724, representing such an asymétrie board, where the central figure is a bird holding a snake with its claws, which bites the bird's head. J. Guiart, 1963, Fig. 284, also illustrates two beautiful asymmetric bird-snake boards, probably from Simberi Island. The same motif, composed in a symmetrical way, with two birds, snake in beak and facing each other, is illustrated in Dr. Pubi. XIII, Taf. XU/5, and there is a similar board in the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, E32317, where the birds with a human head in the beak are given tail to tail. The majority of boards is composed in a symmetric design with both ends alike showing motifs facing - or emanating</page><page sequence="24">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 155 from - a central figure, a bird or a human being. These boards are frieze-like, but there exist also boards composed in three parts - a middle panel and two side panels. In the middle is given an anaturalistic bird, in a heraldic pose, snake in beak and claws. The snake's body crosses the bird in parallel curves and bites the bird's head. Both side panels mostly show a fill-work of identical floral or feather motifs (Peekel, 1927 : 8). Another board of similar type, E1187, shows the bird in the centre holding in its beak a tree-kangaroo upside-down by its tail, whilst one bird on each side attacks the central figure's head and also its base. The side panels are filled in a similar way as mentioned above (see F. McCarthy, 1945 : p. 398). An interesting variation of this theme is given in a small board, E31179, where the central panel shows a human figure emerging from a large crab-head with three legs on each side and large eyes. The human figure holds on, with raised hands, to the upper framework of the panel ; his body is also visible whilst his thighs merge with the crab's head. The face shows distinct human features, and the figure is painted in blue with a white circle on his chest. The side panels (left one missing) are triangular in shape, with a rounded bottom line and filled with tendrils following the outline of the panel and openwork rows of chevrons. The National Gallery of Victoria possesses a similarly-shaped board with the central figure of a bird with a small human head on top of it, bent upwards, and a sun motif on each side of the bird. Another example there shows a similar bird in the centre and two snakes crossing its body in a symmetrical pattern, each biting the side of the bird's head. There are sun motifs filling the side panels, and a bird is given on each end. I call this type of boards the " heraldic bird boards ". The Queensland Museum possesses a very delicate, beautifully carved and painted board, E4518, showing an elevated shield-like feature in the centre, filled with a squatting human being in a framework with a queer up-turned black resin-head showing a beard and black hair. Elevated sun motifs are seen on both sides of this figure, raised from the open work background of delicately-carved ornaments, painted in white and blue, black, white and red. A chevron pattern is seen on the body of the figure. A variation to this board is in the Musée de l'Homme, Paris, where a male figure with raised hands holds on to two snakes, which form the framework of this board. The man stands on a moon crescent, he shows a sun motif on his chest and has the flying ribs or jacket that we saw on the drummer from the British Museum. On each side of the human figure is carved a large sun motif in an ornamental framework with the black fish design, which we saw on the owl masks in the corners of the panels (Fig. I.9). (A carving from a house in New Ireland, also showing the central figure of a man and the side panels filled with painted and carved sun motif and moon crescent, is illustrated by T. Bodrogi (1959 : Fig. 95).) A less elaborate version of this scene is seen on a board in the National Gallery of Victoria, where a male figure, standing on a moon crescent, holds the ends of the cres- cent in his raised hands ; he has a kap kap on his breast. The panels on both sides are filled with an elevated sun or eye motif and on each end a stylized human being or bird. A beautifully-carved board in the Queensland Museum, E4522, shows a ES</page><page sequence="25">156 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS pig's head at the ends and birds picking at an elevated eye motif in the centre. An- other group of carved boards consists of symmetrically carved friezes, where three human figures stand out in bas-relief against a painted background, all holding on to a snake. One example is in the Queensland University Museum, E3349 (Fig. I.10). The central figure stands on a sort of crescent, painted white, and holds on to a black snake. An example of a similar kind is illustrated in J. Guiart (1963 : Fig. 286). The central figure is replaced by an eye or sun motif, surrounded by a snake (?) to which two figures hold on. The ends of the board are in the shape of a fish-head. These boards with fish-head endings are called " Vaval " or two ancestors (see R. Parkinson, 1907 and G. Peekel, 1927, Vol. XXII/17). The Australian Museum possesses a board, E31614, where the centre is given by an eye motif fitted diagonally, as with the owl-masks, and joined on each side by a mouth motif . Another mouth motif, with a bird or fish attacking it from each side, is seen on each side of the central motif and an heraldic bird on a mouth motif is carved on each end of the board. Another rather poorly carved flat board (no number), broken on the right end, shows five sun motifs between horizontal and vertical bands, and a fish-head on the left end. A. B. Meyer, 1895, illustrates in Dr. Pubi. X, Taf. XIV/i, 3, 4, similar boards with a central figure in No. 1, composed like a post figure holding on to rods, and on each side of the figure a large eye motif and, further to the left, a horizontal male figure and, to the right, a horizontal female figure. The board ends in fish-heads ; it is supposed to have come from Simberi Island. Number 3 shows three crested squatting figures (Meyer describes them as frogs with human heads), one in the centre and one on each end of the board ; between are seen two eye motifs, each flanked by two birds. Number 4 is a delightful, light, open-work carving, showing an empty frame in the centre, crossed by rods and tendrils, to which two small sitting persons - one at each end - hold on with their hands, heads tilted upwards, either to fit the com- position or given in the way we saw them on other boards. The National Gallery of Victoria possesses a board, ending in boars' heads, showing an empty space in the centre and two persons with upwards-tilted resin-heads. Board E49722, from the Australian Museum, shows two human figures holding on to rods or snakes with their raised hands. The board ends in fish-heads and is symmetrically composed, although there is no proper centre, just the two figures side by side. Another board from the Australian Museum, E3322, shows no anthropomorphic beings, there is no central figure, just a vertical band separating the two almost identical halves, each ending in a fish-head fitted with boar's tusks. Each half shows a framed owl-mask with all the characteristics of this type, including the little black fish design in two corners, two tail-less birds are seen picking at the owl-mask in the left half, whilst in the right half the two birds face in the same direction. The birds and masks are carved in bas-relief against a painted background. E768, is a beautifully carved open-work board with a naturalistically featured owl in the centre between vertical, decorated bands and horizontal rods (similar to those illustrated in Dr. Pubi. Bd. X, Taf. XIV/4, with the two humans with upwards- tilted heads). The board is composed symmetrically, both sides identical, ending</page><page sequence="26">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 157 in a pig's head. Two more pigs' heads with upturned tongues which are attacked by birds, flank the owl in the centre. The pig's tusks, a large black snake, the rods, vertical bands and birds form a network in which the main motifs are enclosed. There are two very similar interesting boards in the Australian Museum, E3326 and E3327 (PL II (b)), which are probably carved by the same artist. They are open-work carvings, symmetrically composed and very skilfully executed. The centre piece in each board is a massive bust of a man with broad realistic features, the head well set into the wide shoulders. In 3327, the man with extended elbows holds a snake in each hand whose heads are seen touching the upper framework of the board beside the man's ears. A black and white snake is seen between floral motifs, being held in the beak and claws of a naturalistic rooster on each side of the man's bust. The ends of the board are rounded and filled with tendrils, each end slightly different. The board is painted black, white and red. This board seems to be the first attempt, and E3326 might have been carved afterwards as the second is better balanced, simpler and more forceful. The main figure fits better into the available space, whilst it is rather squashed in the first board, showing more of the body with head badly proportioned. A square hole in the top of the heads indicates that a piece is missing in both examples. The second board is very interesting as it shows, in addition to the same motifs as the first board, two human beings squatting in a crescent-shaped boat holding a paddle in their hands in front of their bodies. The heads of these figures are unfortunately missing, only the square hole is seen where they were to be inserted. The ends of the second board are rounded and filled with floral motifs, each of a different kind. The roosters' bodies are coated with a kind of mud into which real chicken feathers are inserted. The motif of the half figure in the centre, as well as the two figures in the boat, are very rare representations as far as I know ; all three show kap kaps painted on their breasts. The boats are painted white, and if the figures did not carry the paddles, one would have thought they were moon crescents, as we saw them on other boards. The hands holding the paddles are very large in proportion to the whole figures and also show an enormous thumb. The half figures on both boards show the kind of flying ribs first encountered on the figure of the drummer from the British Museum. As we see these flying ribs also on other boards in connection with moon and sun symbols, we could relate these boards - especially the second one - to the cult of these celestial bodies. There is one quite unique board in the Australian Museum, E24263 : It is mounted on a sledge-like structure, and was probably meant to be viewed from above, not as the usual boards and carved friezes which are so constructed as to be viewed from the front, although in some cases the reverse side is also carved, sometimes with a different decoration. E24263 is a board carved in open-work and the human beings take only a very subordinate place in the design. The main figures are birds and sun motifs, framed by a wide black snake with a big head, biting its own tail. (A similar framed snake biting its own tail, is seen on a carved board from the Musée de l'Homme, Paris, where a central male figure stands on a moon crescent, flanked</page><page sequence="27">158 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS by two large solar symbols.) The centre of our board consists of a circular opening, framed by a white and red rim with birds attacking it from right and left. The birds touch a sun motif on each side with their tails, onto which two different birds are joined by their tails, biting the head and the middle part of the snake, where it frames the right-hand side of the board, respectively. A large flat fish head ends off the board on each side. Two rods emanate from these fish-heads and these, together with the birds, form the network into which the solar symbols are fitted. With their feet and claws, the birds hold on to the rods and the snake. The queerest feature, however, is six human half-figures, seen on each side of the board, fitted in between the snake and the parallel running rods. They all face in the same direction, so that on the right side they touch the rod with their heads, and on the left side the snake. These little figures are all of the same type, namely, a triangular black head with protruding lips and peg-eyes and flat noses. Their bodies consist of a triangular chest, painted red, to which arms are fitted. There is one figure at each end of the board, and, separated by the feet of the birds - which form part of the framework - two more are given. The eyes of the birds are blue beads. The two birds con- fronting the central circular opening are mainly painted red, whilst the birds biting the snake's head and the snake's body at the opposite end of the board, show black wings with long feathers crossed over in the same way as given on the earpieces of the Dresden boat Figure id. There are, in the Australian Museum, two small, delicately carved boards, which are different in content and form to all the previously-mentioned ones. E1189 shows, against a background of finely cut fretwork, a naturalistic fish of the " Remora " kind, executed in bas-relief on both sides of the fretwork panel. Two small lizards are fitted into the fretwork. The whole panel is framed by a narrow band surrounding the board, which is rounded at the ends. In the centre, below the fish, there is a solid half-spherical piece of wood, probably to stand the board up. E772 is of a different kind, but of similar shape and size, also executed in fretwork. It shows a centre-piece with a strange triangular head, looking down, carved in bas-relief. On the forehead it shows a mouth motif flanked by two large eyes and topped by four flanges. The side panels are filled with open-work floral motifs following the outline of the board, and one each end a fish of naturalistic design. It is possible that these two panels were carved with European tools, both being acquired by the Museum from Captain R. Farrell in 1887 when New Ireland was under German rule. A very similar board to E722, illustrated by A. Buehler, 1962 : Fig. 44, is supposed to have come from Orno, north-western New Ireland. It could be established that boards, carved in open-work, and bas-relief friezes show a much greater variety in the thematic representation than the posts, whatever their symbolic meaning. The human element, which was so predominant in masks and posts, plays a minor part only in boards and friezes, and the birds, snakes and fish - which more or less served as attributes and fill-work at the former group - have taken over together with sun and moon symbols and purely ornamental fill-work.</page><page sequence="28">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 159 5. Fishes and various kinds of Carvings, Ceremonial Boats and Uli Figures There are at the Museum a number of three-dimensional large carvings of fish, all of a similar kind, up to 6 feet long. A large fish-head, mostly with an upturned tongue and two tusks on each side of the very large mouth, is joined by a rather small body with a wide tail fin. The whole creature is vividly painted, the head part has different ornaments to the body, where ornamental scales are given. A small fish is often seen clinging to the big one, on each side of the body, biting its fins. The fish-head is of the same type frequently seen as endings to boards and friezes, and also on the boat of the Stuttgart Linden Museum. Fish-heads of similar type are used as base for human beings. (See G. Peekel, 1929 : Fig. 16, where a large fish of this type is represented.) J. Guiart (1963 : Fig. 288) illustrates the same type of fish from the Basel Völkerkunde Museum, almost 7 feet long, carrying two personalities on its back, skilfully carved in one piece beside the figure in front, the heads, the woman's breasts and the ventral fin of the fish. E28777 in the Australian Museum is another example showing an anthropomorphic being standing on a small fish, fixed to the upturned tongue by a peg. Two side panels filled with ornaments are carved separately and inserted in slits at both sides of the fish's body. On another example from the Australian Museum, E28778, a small human creature is seen side- ways in the fish's mouth. A heavy short black fish, with two persons riding on its back, is in the Museum in Port Moresby. As mentioned in previous chapters, on some posts a fish or fish-head forms the base of the carving ; sometimes one finds a pig-head instead. Also, the carved boards show ends formed by fish- or pig's-heads. It therefore seems likely that those two are interchangeable, unless a dînèrent meaning is expressed in each example. But another example of two almost identical carvings, one with a fish-head and the other with a pig-head, seem to confirm the idea that both appear to have the same symbolic meaning. One is a large pig-head in the Australian Museum, E4179 (PL II (a)) with an upturned tongue, large tusks, fitted onto a short body consisting of a kind of spine with ribs, carved in open work. A frigate bird is sitting on top of the pig-head, biting the upturned tongue. The long tail-feathers of the bird form a network around the rear part of the carving. The other example is illustrated by G. Peekel, 1929 : Fig. 18, where a large fish-head with upturned tongue and tusks, is fitted to a spine with fish bones, also carved in open-work. Large panels filled with feather motifs are joined on to both sides behinds the head. A small bird is seen on the upturned tongue. The illustration is subtitled " Representation of the declining Moon in the Western Sky ". (As expressed before, there is no doubt that carved boards and friezes are connected with moon and sun symbols, but how far Peekel's interpretation is correct in this case, I cannot say.) I would also like to mention here two small open-work boards, E21519 and E21521, from the Australian Museum, which, according to two very similar - although more complex - carvings, illustrated in Dr. Pubi. XIII, Taf. XII/6, 7, are decorations of a boat. E21519 shows a human head with a long feather or snake emanating</page><page sequence="29">i6ö SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS vertically from its mouth. A bird perched on top of the head bites the object ; a fish is seen in the right lower corner and a complicated open-work ornament on top of the bird. (The eyes of the birds illustrated in the Dr. Pubi, consist of blue beads, similar to the eyes of birds on the open-work board E24263 mentioned before.) Two small rather primitive and simple peg-based human figures in the Australian Museum might also have served as decorations or guardian figures of boats, or they might be the contributions of lesser peoples to the grand Malanggan celebrations. E581 might be the head of a figure on a board, or the head of a " Maradan " doll, like the one illustrated by Peekel, 1929 : Fig. 3. The Australian Museum possesses three carved horn-bill heads and one, E62895, is very naturalistically shaped from light unpainted wood. It shows a short neck covered with glued-on blue feathers, a large turbo-shell inlaid eye on the white ground and a large bill (approximately 20 cm. long). Around the eye short ropes of coloured European beads are fitted, and above the eye is a carved hook-like protrusion. A. B. Meyer (1895 : Dr. Pubi. X, Taf. XVII/ii) illustrates exactly the same bird-head, identical in all details, donated by R. Parkinson in 1894 and originating from Cape Sass (N.E. Coast of New Ireland). Meyer describes this object as a dance emblem, held by the dancer between his teeth by a hook-like protrusion. The two other bird-heads are different in so far as they show a longer neck part, to which is added a carved circular open-work part, filled with a floral motif. Boats Although there are no carvings of boats from New Ireland in the Australian Museum, I think it important to mention the two outstanding examples : the Dresden boat from Gardner Island, collected before 1900, and the boat in the Stuttgart Linden Museum, carved in 1902 in the village of Parai on the north-east coast of New Ireland not far from Medina. The Dresden boat is decorated with a bird-head on the sides, at stern and bow, and both ends connected by an ornamental band : it is 3 -32 metres long and contains four personalities standing with outstretched right arm and holding a paddle. These four figures are all slightly different, and - as mentioned before - provide us with quite a number of interesting and varied motifs from this island. The figures belong to the broad-nosed type from Tabar (Gardner) Island that we saw before on other figures from the same island. Each figure stands on a base, resembling a tridacna shell, whose points are connected to tendrils forming the network of these carvings. Between the legs of the figures two curved shark-like fishes are seen ; in some cases back-to-back on top of each other, in other cases facing in the same direction. A frigate bird, whose long tail feathers are joined on to the nose of the figure, attacks the fish. The tendrils surrounding the figures seem to pierce the fibrous hair-do and end on top of the head in four horn-like features. Three of the figures show painted white circles on their breast (kap kap), and all the figures and the by-work are richly decorated with painted ornaments in red, white, black and yellow. The extended right arm of each figure is carved separately and added to the figure in the same way as the earpieces. Each</page><page sequence="30">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 161 figure holds a small paddle vertically, pointing upwards, with a long thumb. The earpieces are different on each figure and show a great variety of motifs, described on p. 153. The Stuttgart Boat is much larger, probably the largest carving in existence from New Ireland. It is 5*89 metres long, more ornate than the Dr. boat, and contains ten personalities, five standing and five sitting. The latter are carved in one piece with the boat, and each end of the boat is shaped into a fish-head of the same type as we saw on carved boards, with upturned tongue and large tusks. The sides of the boat show, against a red background, a bas-relief frieze of opposing pairs of flying fishes or birds, and on the right side a human face. The first standing figure has both arms extended horizontally, whilst the other four figures extend their right arm only and show a paddle pointing downwards leaning against it. The seated figures hold on to the edge of the boat ; they only show decorated heads, each with a bird on top. Only three of the standing figures are topped by birds. In com- parison to the Dr. boat, the figures appear coarse and of a quite different style, less rigid, more human, if one may say so, although the standing figures are richly decorated with a network of tendrils and a shark or snake respectively in front of their bodies, biting their chin. All figures show large kap kaps on their breasts and some have tusks stuck through their noses. The story related to the boats recalls in both cases that the crew of a fishing boat had been lost and that the boats were carved in their memory to be exhibited at the Malanggan celebrations. On my visit to New Ireland in July, 1967, I visited the village of Parui and spoke to three old men, still carving Malanggan symbols, and showed them a photograph of the Stuttgart Boat. None of them could remember the event of the drowning of so many men from one village, or recognize the boat, though it must have been quite a memorable event in the life of the villagers.
