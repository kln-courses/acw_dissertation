<plain_text><page sequence="1">A ROMANTIC BIRCH TREE BY JOHAN CHRISTIAN CLAUSEN DAHL NE of the most striking characteristics of the Romantic Movement was the powerful stimulation of artistic activ- ity it engendered in areas-Scotland and Scandinavia come to mind-hitherto dormant in painterly expression of international significance. The profound stirrings of subjective expression exerted an irresistible appeal for the far northern temperament which had accommodated itself only fitfully to the rational orientation of much Renaissance and Baroque art. As a result, the serious student of romantic art in search of repre- sentative examples must often stray far from the orthodox art centers of Paris, Rome and London. The Art Museum now possesses a gouache representing a birch tree (Figure i)l by the artist who has been termed the father of Norwegian painting-Johan Christian Clausen Dahl (1788-1857) who, during a long and fruitful career, not only became the initiator of significant painterly achievement in his native country but also a distinguished professor of art at the Dresden Academy, a leader in the founding of the art galleries of Oslo and Bergen, and a scholar of Norwegian mediaeval architecture.2 Born of humble parents in Bergen (his father was a poor fisherman), his youthful artistic aspirations were encouraged by local guildsmen and he found the means, in 1811, to enter that great seminal point of romantic art in the North-the Royal Academy of Copenhagen. Here he became enamored of Dutch landscape painting of the seventeenth century and learned to admire the proto-romantic art of Claude Lorrain. In 1818, he settled in Dresden where he was appointed a professor at the Academy in 1824. Dresden was destined to remain his home but, like so many romantic artists, he felt a great urge to travel.

Once returned to Germany, he undertook numerous journeys throughout his life to Norway where he sketched native scenery, encouraged foundation of the museums of Oslo and Bergen and studied mediaeval stave churches which he pub- lished in 1836-37 in a volume entitled Denkmale einer sehr ausgebildeten Holzbaukunst aus den friiheren Jahrhunderten in den inneren Landschaften Norwegens. Dahl's activity as pedagogue and scholar in no way inhibited the spontaneous and romantic character of his painting. Like so many nineteenth-century artists he rejected, in his mature work, the conventions of the ideal landscape tradition and endeavored to convey an undoctored image of nature. In his drawings he developed a free, active technique that enabled him to capture the vivid, sensuous surfaces of visual reality-a tech- nique which in his finished works was tempered by a predilec- tion for linear clarity characteristic of Northern art. This com- bination of spontaneity and linear clarity is evident in two of his major works in the National Gallery in Oslo-Stugun6set (1842) and Stalheim (1851).3 However, if Dahl shared the romantic delight in a fresh, de- classicized image of nature, he was also responsive to the sug- gestion of German writers and artists that landscape, beyond mirroring visual reality, should operate as the vehicle of sub- jective expression. In Dresden, he became a close friend and associate of the greatest of German romantic painters, Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840). With Friedrich he was exposed to the writings of Ludwig Tieck who, in his novel of 1798, Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen, required his hero, a young painter of the time of Diirer, Ito inquire, "For of what use are all these twigs and leaves to me? this accurate copying of grasses and flowers? Not these plants, not these mountains, I wish to imitate, but my soul, my mood that has possession of me at this very moment-these I wish to retain for myself and to communicate to other intelligent beings."4 3 For illustrations of these works, see Carl Laurin, Emil Hannover and Jens Thiis, Scandinavian Art, New York, 1922, pp. 442 and 443. 4 Quoted by Robert M.

Princeton's Birch Tree aptly illustrates the dual aspect of Dahl's romanticism combining a profoundly sensitive rendering of color, mass and texture with an intensely expressive romantic content. 14</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2. J. C. C. Dahl, Birch Tree in the Storm; Oil Painting, in Bergen. Dahl's technical facility enables him to achieve considerable impact on the sensuous level. The steep, wooded mountains and the damp, overcast sky in the background receive a broad, generalized treatment which contrasts dramatically with the bright, vivid rendering of the tree in the foreground. Without 15</page><page sequence="5">resorting to precise description, he establishes the flaking bark of the tree trunk by substantial daubs of pigment while the fragile massing of the feathery foliage is sketched in by means of tiny flecks of the brush. These varied technical resources succeed in suggesting the material nature of the tree while re- taining an agreeable autonomy of brush and pigment. But while the Birch Tree is notably seductive in purely visual terms its value as a document of romantic landscape painting derives from its potent revelation of mood and feeling. On this level the picture operates with great efficiency deploying all its pictorial devices for this purpose. Thus, the vivid con- trast between the tree and its background not only generates visual drama, it contributes to the meaning of the image. Precariously perched on the side of the rocky cliff, the tree bravely asserts its existence against the hostile, cold background -an environment where other trees have almost been oblit- erated by the mournful, all-pervading blue and violet tonalities. The assertive quality of the tree is further dramatized by the tensile, diagonal thrust of its trunk out of the bleak rock to which it clings. And the brightness of the bark, in conjunction with the flickering, almost spectral glow of the foliage created by a network of tiny, nervous pinpoints of green, gray and white pigment, suggests an intense, almost hectic vitality. Yet, the existence of this vibrant organism is clearly threatened. Visible signs of decay and erosion abound. The upper part of the asser- tive trunk bends back under the burden of years of unrelenting pressure by the wind and its top has broken off during the course of some grim encounter with hostile forces; the bark, though bright, has begun to peel; the lowest branches wilt and languish; and the base of the trunk ominously reveals a yawning aperture whose sides assume an almost anthropomorphic quality-sug- gestive of human knees faltering on the edge of an abyss. All these factors contribute to the romantic program of the image which, in its presentation of an organic entity struggling to maintain its existence in an uncongenial universe, projects a powerful mood of pessimism. Signed and dated 1850, the Birch Tree can be related to an oil painting of 1849 by Dahl in the Bergen Art Gallery entitled 16</page><page sequence="6">Figure 3. J. C. C. Dahl, Drawing of a Birch Tree, in Oslo. 17</page><page sequence="7">Birch Tree in the Storm (Figure 2).5 Here, too, we discover a birch tree which clings tenaciously to the earth on the edge of a precipice; again the vibrant trunk and foliage stand out in brilliant relief against a broadly-painted background. In- deed, the gouache might be taken as a work after the painting of 1849. Yet, a close comparison of the two reveals subtle but significant alterations in detail and in mood. The proportions of the tree have changed-in the gouache, the height and thick- ness of the trunk have shrunk giving a less monumental effect. Also, in the gouache, the curvature of the trunk is more pro- nounced; the branches are more dessicated; the vital agitation of the foliage has declined; the decay at the base of the trunk has progressed; and the ground to which it clings has become more barren. In other words, this work is not simply a replica of the one in Bergen. Here the birch tree has further deteri- orated under stress and, consequently, presents a more melan- choly and pessimistic image. Further insight into Dahl's subjective exploitation of this object derives from other drawings of the tree. One, signed and dated 1849, is cited by Leif 0stby as a pencil and wash drawing after the painting in Bergen.6 More interesting is a pencil drawing of a birch tree signed and dated September 2 st, 1823 (Figure 3)7 which depicts a delicate, youthful tree which must be the prototype of the later versions. Juxtaposition of the slender, aspiring, young tree with the ravaged, though still defiant ones of the mature painting and the gouache creates a potent and poignant reminder of the vulnerability and mortality of living things. In their graphic dramatization of the life cycle they demonstrate the freedom of 'the romantic artist to utilize nature for his own expressive ends. The drawing, the painting and the gouache, while firmly rooted in close ob- servation of nature, gain significance not merely as clinical reports on the material development and decline of an organic structure. Indeed, Dahl has taken the liberty of varying the 5 Illustration from a photograph by Fotograf Jan H. Reimers, Paradis, Norway. 6 Leif 0stby, op.cit., plate 233.

The later trees might be better described as variations on the theme of the birch tree-varia- tions in which Dahl, in the manner of a musician, feels free to alter and to embroider the basic material in order to record more accurately the shifting moods of his inner, emotional life. In accordance with romantic theory which advocated the emula- tion of the suggestive power of music by the visual arts8 Dahl's birch trees exist as vehicles by which the soul of the artist com- municates with the soul of the spectator.
