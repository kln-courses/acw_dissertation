<plain_text><page sequence="1">Service abroad: Holderlin, Poet-Translator A Lecture David Constantine nicht, dafi ich seyn sollt etwas, sondern ' Zu lernen (Holderlin, 'Patmos') Translation, the thing itself, what it really entails, is fraught with issues of dependence and autonomy. Holderlin, a great translator and a greater poet, embodies the resulting struggles with peculiar force. Poetry and translation are at the centre of a heroic striving for autonomy in his vocation; therefore, if we ask what is truly at stake when this poet translates we shall better understand both his colossal achievement and his tragedy. Like John Clare and Gerard de Nerval, Holderlin readily turned his own life into myth. He remarked in letters to his unstable friend Casimir Bohlendorff, Tm afraid in the end I might go the way of old Tantalus who had more of gods than he could digest', and nine months or so later, 'as they say of heroes I can surely say of myself: Apollo has smitten me'.1 By this date, 1801-2, he was on the brink of the illness that would confine him to the tower in the town walls of Tubingen for the whole long latter half of his existence; but from early on he had understood the figurative line or allegory of his life, a chief constituent being the fact, and the metaphor, of journeying and homecoming.

Holderlin, born, like Wordsworth, Hegel, and Beethoven, in 1770, was of the generation who believed, for a time at least, that through the revolution in France things in their own country too, and indeed for all mankind, would get conclusively better. His education through Swabia's theological schools was provided free, on the understanding that at the end of it he would serve the Church. At the Stifi in Tubingen (among his fellow pupils were Hegel and Schelling) he read classics, philosophy, and theology. The classics and philosophy widened and excited his mind, made it more demanding. The third was actually the training for a career which he had to resist, if he was to respond to the pressures exerted by the first two. Students finishing at the Stift could defer being drafted into a parish, as curate and then as pastor, only by taking on some other employment approved of, for an interval, by the Church authorities. The most usual such evasion was the post of Hofmeister or live-in tutor in an aristocratic or wealthy bourgeois family; preferably the post would be 'abroad', which at that time meant anywhere outside Swabia. Holderlin became a live-in tutor abroad four times. At its best the job might offer a young man the space and time outside his hours of duty (normally not too many or too hard) to get on with what he really wanted to be doing, which in Holderlin's case was poetry. In practice Holderlin never could manage the conflicting demands. Tutors, usually the intellectual superiors of their employers, received pay, and thus belonged socially among the servants. A tutor always knew his position, and in it he was constrained and more or less demeaned. In J.M.R. Lenz's play Der Hofmeister , 1774, the tutor falls in love with his charge, and, to escape that quandary and fit himself better for a life of servitude, he castrates himself. Falling in love 'inappropriately' was a very likely accident in the profession. During his first appointment, in the household of Schiller's friend, Charlotte von Kalb, in Waltershausen, near Jena, Holderlin became very fond of the family governess, Wilhelmine Kirms, and had a child by her. During his next such employment, in the Gontard family in Frankfurt, he fell passionately in love with the wife, Susette, and she with him. She became the Diotima of his poems. Their shared and thwarted love was the central experience of his life. Together with her, in that city renowned for its philistinism and brutal pursuit of money, he knew himself to be engaged in a struggle for the freedom to live a life of his own, one in which love and poetry would have their due; and he soon knew that he would lose. 80</page><page sequence="3">Translation and Literature 20 (201 1) After each of these two employments Holderlin spent some time trying to establish himself independently, first at the University of Jena, by the generosity of Charlotte; second, managing on his own savings and sparse earnings, in Homburg vor der Hohe, three hours outside Frankfurt, corresponding with Susette and seeing her, if they were lucky, once a month. In both those bids for independence Holderlin failed, and returned home, back to his anxious mother, who exerted her own tyranny over him, depriving him of his patrimony (his father had died when he was two) and urging him to do the expected thing and marry into a rural curacy. Back home he could not settle - his mother and the church authorities sought to take control of his life. Homecoming is one of the great topics of his poems: the wanderer returns and finds himself, as Clare put it, 'homeless at home'. Twice more Holderlin went abroad, for the same type of employment, first to Hauptwyl in Switzerland, then to Bordeaux, and twice returned, his condition radically worsening. He fled again to Homburg, Susette having died meanwhile, and held on there for another year or so. His next homecoming was to the clinic and the tower. He was thirty-seven. Those five periods abroad, which were his efforts to establish himself (or, as that hope failed, merely to survive), all ended in homecomings, each a step closer to collapse. Going abroad in search of autonomy, coming home having failed to achieve it - this is the chief fact and metaphor of Holderlin's life. Translation, which entails moving abroad into the foreign language and returning afterwards into one's own, has to be understood, in his case, in that context. Holderlin propounded no theory of translation and had no fixed way of translating either; it varied according to his varying needs. His few explicit remarks are, however, suggestive. In March 1794 he wrote to his friend (and fellow-graduate of the Stift) Christian Ludwig Neuffer, who was translating Virgil: The great Roman's spirit will surely be a wonderful strengthener of your own. In the struggle with his language yours must become more and more agile and vigorous.' He reinforced that view in a second letter (July 1794): 'Translation does our language good, like gymnastics. It gets beautifully supple when forced to accommodate itself to foreign beauty and greatness and also often to foreign whims' (VI, 109-10, 125). The two remarks together are a very clear statement of what we might call the writerly attitude towards translation, which boils down to 'What's in it for me?' This self-interest, or, to put it more sympathetically, this interest in the good of one's native tongue, is especially likely to move from the back of the mind to the front 81</page><page sequence="4">David Constantine/Holderlin, Poet-Translator whenever the translator is a poet translating poetry. Poets translate because they love the foreign poet and wish to make him or her better known; but also, and not just incidentally, they translate to get better at their native tongue. In our own days of mid-Atlantic English, Eurospeak, and world pidgin, a chief responsibility of the writer-translator is to understand not just what the foreign and the native tongues have in common, but also, perhaps more important, what are their ancient and irreconcilable differences. Translation is indeed a sort of combat with the foreign text, but a respectful and loving one, undertaken in the urgent desire to learn. Seeing what the foreign tongue can do, you may induce or even force your own to do something analogous. In that same letter of July 1794, having agreed with Neuffer that 'translation is good for you', Holderlin goes on to warn him off doing too much of it: Language is the organ of our intellect and feelings, the sign of our imagination and our ideas; we are the ones it has to obey. If it serves too long abroad there's a danger, I think, that it won't quite ever again do what we want it to do: be the free and pure and one and only expression of the spirit within. (VI, 125) So far as we know, Holderlin had done very little translation by this time. He seems to have understood in theory before practice what the benefits and the risks of it would be. The risk he foresaw in the summer of 1794 - that a writer might lose his own language if he served too long abroad - is one he ran deliberately and to extremes six years later in translating Pindar. And in 'Mnemosyne1, a poem he worked at whilst revising his translations of Sophocles, he enlarged that professional risk into a sign of the times: 'and we have almost | Lost our speech abroad' (II, 195). Holderlin translated from the two languages his schooling gave him, Latin and Greek. In fact his earliest translations from those two languages were carried out while he was still in school. He never achieved complete mastery of either: he was a great translator, but first and foremost a poet and not a linguist. Becoming surer of what that vocation entailed, he translated as a poet, for the good of his own language and for what he perceived to be the good of his contemporaries. There are scraps of more or less close translation in his novel Hyperion and in his poems. It is certain, too, that he did more translation than has survived or has come to light. Every translation would be worth looking at in detail, Holderlin's German against the Latin or Greek, and each 82</page><page sequence="5">Translation and Literature 20 (201 1) project in the context (the stratum) of his work of that time. The following notes on the items in my non-exhaustive list of translations are brief and inadequate, but slightly more expansive discussion of some of the issues follows. ^ ^ ^ I shall enumerate and comment on his translations first from Latin. â¦ The first 590 lines of Book 1 of Lucan's Pharsalia, perhaps in 1790 - that is, while Holderlin was still in the Stift. The text breaks off mid-sentence, and it is certain there was further material that has not survived. Lucan never became an important author for Holderlin, but the translation is into hexameters, a form he had already used two or three times in poems of his own and would use again, most notably in the 'Der Archipelagus'. This early exercise was good training. â¦ The Phaeton episode from Ovid's Metamorphoses (2.1-366), 1795. In April 1795 Schiller asked Holderlin to translate the story of Phaeton from Ovid's Metamorphoses into ottava rima, for publication in his Musen-Almanach. At first Holderlin was pleased to have the commission and he made a general remark to Neuffer, on an important difference between translating poetry and writing it: 'You are not so impassioned as when composing something of your own' (VI, 169). Only about sixty lines of this translation (corresponding to Ovid's 2.31-99) have survived. Almost certainly Holderlin did the whole thing; he may even have done the final lines of Book 1 also, in which Phaeton is introduced. He sent it in the Summer of 1795 to Schiller, who declined to publish it. 'Phaeton' was Holderlin's one and only commissioned translation. As to the subject: after his difficult time in Walterhausen Holderlin was in Jena, and Schiller, the revered fellow-Swabian, seeing him occasionally, perhaps thought the example of Phaeton, who overreached himself, would steady him down. Translation gave Holderlin several alter egos, and Phaeton was one of them. He (or Icarus) was to have been the subject, or catastrophic final image, of a poem Holderlin spoke of writing a couple of years later around 1798; Hyperion, the eponymous hero of Holderlin's novel, an early version of which Schiller had published in 1794, is by name and temperament akin to Phaeton; and Wilhelm Waiblinger, who wrote the best account of Holderlin in the tower (and died young), certainly knew what he was doing when he called his novel, whose hero is modelled on Holderlin, 83</page><page sequence="6">David Constantine/ Holderlin, Poet-Translator Phaeton . Schiller suggested not only the text, but also the form into which Holderlin should translate it: ottava rima. Ottava rima for Latin hexameters was a sort of formal experiment, carried out vicariously for Schiller by Holderlin, who, in his own poetry, breaking away from Schiller, would soon give up rhyme altogether, only resuming it in the tower. â¦ Forty-two lines from Ovid's Heroides , from the epistle of Deianira to Hercules, probably 1796. Like the original, the translation was done in elegiac couplets, a form established in German by Goethe and Schiller, and developed ever more expressively by Holderlin himself. â¦ A prose translation, but tending to elegiac couplets, again from Ovid's Heroides (18.1-1 16), of the epistle of 'Leander to Hero' This substantial piece was probably done in the Summer and/or Autumn of 1799, with Holderlin in Homburg, looking over to Frankfurt and Susette Gontard somewhat as Leander did over the Hellespont to Hero. Some years earlier, long before Susette, he had written a poem in the voice of Hero. Now he knew very well what it felt like being Leander. â¦ A translation into hexameters of Virgil's Aeneid 9.176-318, concerning the heroic pair Nisus and Euryalus, probably in 1797. This represents further practice in the ottava rima form, but also, perhaps, an imaging of his own relationship with the politically radical Isaak von Sinclair, a strong and rather dangerous character in Holderlin's life and poetry from the Stift until the clinic. In the final version of a poem on the subject of their friendship begun early in 1800, they appear as the Dioscuri. â¦ Two of Horace's odes (2.6 and 4.3) belonging to the first half of 1798. Holderlin's chief interest was probably formal. His versions are metrically experimental, not in the verse forms of the originals. Holderlin seems not hereafter to have translated from Latin. Holderlin's translations from Greek include the following. â¦ A prose version (containing frequent hexameters) of the whole of Book 1 and a good deal of Book 2 (as far as the Catalogue of Ships), of Homer's Iliad; probably translated in 1788 while Holderlin was still at school in Maulbronn. 84</page><page sequence="7">Translation and Literature 20 (201 1) In this substantial piece of work, two years before the aforemen- tioned Lucan translation, he is feeling his way into the hexameter line he was beginning to use in verse of his own. Achilles, named in the Iliad's opening line, accompanied Holderlin to the brink of madness, another alter ego. Holderlin alludes to a scene translated here - Achilles on the seashore complaining to his mother Thetis (1.348-430) - in the metrical version of Hyperion (1794-5); in 1798, in Homburg, he made an elegiac poem out of that same scene, explicitly associating Achilles' loss of Briseis with his own loss of Susette, and sketched an essay on him;2 and in the late poem 'Mnemosyne' he writes with conclusive sadness, 'At the fig tree my | Achilles died' (II, 198). Holderlin opened up a world of potent imagery in this, his first, translation. â¦ 'Reliquie von Alzaus', 1793, actually three skolia (drinking songs) from Book 15 of Athenaeus' Deipnosophists in praise of the tyrannicides Harmodius and Aristogiton. The mood in the Stift in 1793 was described by the worried principal as 'extremely democratic . . . French anarchy and regicide brazenly defended' (VII. ii, p. 444). Holderlin's first mention of these texts, enthusiastically approving, is in his Tubingen dissertation, 'History of the Fine Arts among the Greeks', then in Hyperion. His studies, reinforced by translation, gave him icons for his life and times. Harmodius and Aristogiton, Achilles and Patroclus, and Nisus and Euryalus make a series of heroic friendships which Holderlin could imagine himself continuing, chiefly with Sinclair. Once again there is a formal interest too: Holderlin departs from the metre and lineation of the originals, consciously devising an equivalent, Greek-looking shape for his lines. â¦ The chorus from Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus (668-93), in 1796. This is not quite the earliest of Holderlin's Sophocles translations (see the note on Ajax below), but a lovely piece, already proof of his ability to write, from Greek, a German that is strangely poetic. He does not keep to the metre, the word order, or the lineation of the Greek, but develops an extensive hypotactic syntax and rhythms of his own. This is one way of translating - he will soon try others. We shall note below his return to the play seven or more years later. This Chorus is framed and crowded in the manuscript by drafts of half-a-dozen of his own 2 See Holderlin's Essays and letters, translated by Jeremy Adler and Charlie Louth (London, 2009; reviewed elsewhere in the present volume), pp. 249-52. 85</page><page sequence="8">David Constantine/Holderlin, Poet-Translator poems - an excellent concrete image of the thorough involvement of translation in original composition. â¦ Euripides' Hecuba , 736-867 (1796). For the most part Holderlin translates the Greek trimeters into pentameters, but he adheres quite closely to the Greek word order. â¦ Pindar's First Olympian Ode, lines 1-10 (probably 1798). Embedded in the unfinished essay 'On the different modes of poetic composition', this is a translation that in purpose and procedure is quite unlike the great Pindar translation of 1800. Here he translates (rather inaccurately) to fit and develop the argument of his essay. â¦ Euripides' Bacchae , lines 1-24 (Autumn 1799). This translation belongs with the next two (and with essays, the tragedy Empedokles , and poems) as a part of Holderlin's intensive effort around 1 800 to orientate himself and his own writing by a close reading of the Greeks. No more Latin: he will come into his own language through Greek. Here he takes over the Greek line - trimeters - and keeps close to the word order, making a lovely strangeness. Translating the opening lines of the Bacchae and (see below) the chorus from Antigone , Holderlin was working mimetically , to test whether the Greek metres could be carried over into German and made effective there. The twenty-four lines from the Bacchae are followed immediately in the manuscript by the extensive drafts of 'Wie wenn am Feiertage . . . ', Holderlin's only attempt to compose a poem of his own in which the metrical responsions of Pindar's odes would be replicated. That is, he moved at once from trying how well one verse form - iambic trimeters - works in a translation into German, to how another, strophic responsions, might work in a poem composed in German. Furthermore, he took into 'Wie wenn am Feiertage', from those just translated lines, the account of the death of Semele and the birth of her son Dionysus in the lightning that killed her, a myth that would haunt his verse ever after. â¦ Sophocles' Antigone , lines 332-52 (the strophe and antistrophe of the first stasimon), 1799. In this translation also Holderlin reproduced the metre of the original. (Some pages later in the same notebook he wrote out the metrical scheme of the parodos of the play.) In the translation of the whole of Antigone published in 1804 Holderlin abandoned all 86</page><page sequence="9">Translation and Literature 20 (201 1) attempt at exact metrical correspondence, radicalizing his language instead. Much of Holderlin's drastic development as poet-translator can be seen by setting the two versions of Antigone 332-52 side by side. â¦ Some 2000 lines (which have survived, although he may well have done more) of Pindar's Olympian and Pythian Odes (probably first half of 1800, with Holderlin still in Homburg). He translated word for word, sometimes syllable by syllable, fracturing words in German as they were fractured in Greek by the lineation of the edition he used, getting as close as possible to root meanings. The manuscript looks like a fair copy, but there is no evidence that he wished to publish these translations, and no journal would have taken them anyway. The whole colossal labour was an exercise, to learn what German could be made to do if pushed through Greek. As I have stressed elsewhere in relation to Holderlin's adherence to what I called 'the strictest mechanicalness': 'All the time he was learning what the German language would take, what it could do, how close it could be induced to approximate the Greek (in divisions that pay regard to etymology), how it differs and has its own possibilities (spanning the lines with its different grammar). His first principle was to keep to the Greek, and to see what good would come of that; but proceeding thus, he saw how near other beauties lay, intrinsic in the Greek.'3 Holderlin himself, as his translator Michael Hamburger points out, was well aware that the language of his late hymns and fragments would be judged too 'unconventional' by contemporary readers, not only because of the polysemies of his lexis but also, as Hamburger puts it, because of their 'syntactic preposterousness'.4 â¦ Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone entire, with notes. Holderlin had versions of both plays ready and was looking for a publisher by the summer of 1802. Then in the winter of 1803-4, when he and Friedrich Wilmans had come to an agreement, he worked over them again, especially Antigone. They came out the following April and met with derision. The text was littered with misprints, and better philologists than Holderlin enjoyed listing his lexical errors. However, these translations entered the mainstream of German and European consciousness along with the rest of Holderlin's work around the time 3 David Constantine, 'Holderlin's Pindar: The Language of Translation', MLR , 73 (1978), 825-34 (pp. 829-30). 4 Holderlin, Poems and Fragments , translated by Michael Hamburger (London, 2004), p. xl. 87</page><page sequence="10">David Constantine/ Holderlin, Poet-Translator of the First World War. Antigone was first performed in 1913, Oedipus in 1921. There have been many stagings and adaptations of both since then, notably by Carl Orff, Brecht, and Heiner Muller. Three or four modes or strata of translation are evident in the two plays, the chief being the literal and the interpretative. In the first (more in Oedipus) Holderlin kept very close to the Greek word order and sought out root meanings as in his Pindar translation, though not quite so drastically. And in the second (more in Antigone) he 'elucidated' the text, to bring it closer, as he said, 'to our way of thinking' (V, 268). His extensive notes on the two plays do the same, but in language that itself requires much elucidation. In his contemporaneous 'Pindar Fragments' he operated similarly, in a more concentrated form, as will be mentioned below. Holderlin understood Antigone as a play for his age, the times shifting violently from kingship to the republican. Also remarkable - and disturbing - is the ecstatically extreme force of Antigone's defiance of authority. â¦ Twenty-eight lines from the opening scene of Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus , in April 1803 at the earliest. This may be a start at a translation of the whole play, to complete the Theban 'trilogy' and pushing on with a project to translate all seven of Sophocles' surviving plays. The lines are hauntingly beautiful in the manner of Oedipus and Antigone , and it would be an illuminating exercise to compare them with the choral lines from Colonus belonging to Holderlin's output of 1796. â¦ Three extracts from Sophocles' Ajax, lines 394-427, 596-645, and 693-718; 1803 at the earliest, possibly as late as 1805. For each of these three pieces Holderlin gave a page reference to the edition (the so-called 'Juntina') he selected and translated them from. Perhaps he hoped to place them in a literary periodical as one work, the three passages needing to be read together? Ajax is another persona Holderlin approached and adopted through close reading and translation. He appears in an early version of Hyperion - indeed, the lines translated here (19-34 and 1-3) were first done there very differently (see III, 240, 257) - and these same passages supply the epigraph of the poem 'Der blinde Sanger' and powerfully contribute to 'Mnemosyne', an argument in favour of supposing that the poems and translations were done about the same time, in 1803. Ajax went mad. He is a dangerous alter ego for a translator on the edge. By their language, rhythms, and syntax these three translations, like much late 88</page><page sequence="11">Translation and Literature 20 (201 1) Holderlin, actually conjure up a state likely to overwhelm the mind producing them. Ajax went raving mad and died, as 'Mnemosyne' puts it, 'in der Fremd' (II, 198) - abroad. â¦ 'Pindar-Fragments', probably in the winter of 1803-4. Even more than the Ajax excerpts, this is a single coherent work. Holderlin selected nine 'fragments' - that is, lines of Pindar still extant because they were preserved and handed down by other authors - translated them, and added to each a commentary or interpretation. So exegesis follows translation, which is itself, of course, a form of exegesis. But in this case cryptic utterances - verse translations of fragments of a notoriously difficult poetry - are followed by interpretations so elusive that they too require exegesis. Each with its title, translated text, and commentary makes a delicately unified entity, as the commentary resists separation from its text; and among the nine together there is much interplay. These translations of Pindar vary in their mode, and, unlike those done in 1800, do not adhere slavishly to the word order of the original. The fragment 'Untreue der Weisheit' contains a translation of Pythian 4, 180-9, done much more freely, in that respect, than they were in 1800. But the later translations, and the 'interpretative' prose accompanying them, do nonetheless achieve a beautiful strangeness, very much like the language of Holderlin's own late poems. In fact, through two acts of service to a text (translating it, explaining it) Holderlin makes something uniquely his: he achieves autonomy in a form militating against it. â¦ Lines 23-79 (with gaps) of Pindar's Pythian 1; probably 1803 but perhaps later. This translation is more interpretative - in the manner of the Antigone translation - than the 1800 version of these lines, and not so bound to the Greek word order. S S In the second half of this discussion, having enumerated what it consisted of, I seek to draw out some of what Holderlin's activity as a translator meant. Translation and metaphor are etymologically and in practice kith and kin. Both imply 'a carrying over'. This is more obvious in German, a transparent language. Ubersetzen and ubertragen both mean 'to translate'; but the latter, the less usual of the two in that sense, also gives in its past participle an adjectival meaning, 'metaphorical'. So the phrase 'im iibertragenen Sinn' means 89</page><page sequence="12">David Constantine/Holderlin, Poet-Translator 'in a figurative or metaphorical sense'. Holderlin's understanding of metaphor was large and ambitious. He understood each poem in its entirety to be an act of metaphor. A potential poem, all the makings of it present in the poet's mind, only becomes real to anyone else by being carried over into the language and rhythms of writing or utterance. Those inner makings, he said, have to be translated (iibertragen) 'in einen fremden analogischen Stoff ; that is, into a material shape that will be analogous to them (an adequate correlative of them) but also 'foreign' - foreign in the sense that a material, palpable, external thing is foreign to an immaterial, impalpable, inner state. Holderlin thought poetry akin to religion, and the language in which he described it and the ambitions he had for it are marked by that conviction. So when he says of divinity that, being invisible, it must 'schiket sich in Fremdes' ('send and fit itself into something foreign', II, 210); or that divine forces operate in the world 'in Knechtsgestalt'('in servile form', II, 119, after Philippians 2:7, said of Christ: 'took upon him the form of a servant'); or that the gods, feeling nothing themselves, need humanity to feel for them (II, 110, 145), he is describing how the poem itself must work. God 'alienates Himself into the foreignness of humanity, into Christ; in other words, he translates Himself, Christ is a metaphor of Him. The realization of a poetic idea in language is akin to the incarnation of divinity in human form. Holderlin loved the Greek pantheon for its anthropomorphism: so many metaphors, translations of the divine, in human shape. The personae arrived at through translation are metaphors of possible lives of the translator himself. They are individual metaphors within the large metaphor constituted by the entirety of the translation. A translation is a metaphor of a foreign original text, of its words, but also of the translator's idea of the particular project. This is very evident in Holderlin's translations of Pindar's odes and of Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone. In each there is a transference of lexical sense, but also, just as important, of an idea; and what is involved in that transference varies greatly between them. Three texts, three translations: three reincarnations in the flesh and blood of another language, three foreign and analogous correlatives of the different endeavours. Holderlin's comment on his Phaeton translation - 'You are not so impassioned as when composing something of your own' - may be associated with Coleridge's comment in the second Preface to his translation of Wallenstein : 'Translation of poetry into poetry is difficult, because the Translator must give a brilliancy to his language without that warmth of original conception, from which such brilliancy would 90</page><page sequence="13">Translation and Literature 20 (201 1) follow of its own accord.'5 The translator serves a text. The only adequate translation of a poem is another poem. But in the making of that necessary native-language poem the poet-translator will inevitably be constrained (his warmth or liveliness will be reduced) by the need to serve a composition which is not his own. Translation is service, poetry is autonomy. Nonetheless, translation may be a way to autonomy. In a letter to Bohlendorff, Holderlin wrote that 'our own [das eigne ] has to be learned every bit as much as what is foreign to us [das Fremde]' and that 'the free use of one's own is the hardest thing' (VI, 426). The premise is that it is harder to learn and fully come into that which is naturally ours than that which is foreign. Indeed, our way into our own is through the more easily learnable foreign. In Holderlin's case, that meant through the Greeks, through translating them in a variety of ways. For a nation also, the free use of what is truly 'national', the nation's own, is a hard achievement: 'Nothing is harder for us to learn than the free use of our national qualities' ('das Nationelle', VI, 425). European nations, one after the other, came into the free use of their own vernaculars by an increasingly confident self-assertion against a dominant foreign language, whether Latin, French, Italian, or English. Native writers had to demonstrate what their vernacular could do, and often, paradoxically, translation was the way. Chaucer asserted English by translating from Latin and French and by adapting French and Italian sources for his own ends. German literature in the seventeenth century actually came into being by main force of translation. Martin Opitz, in his Buck von der Deutschen Poeterey , 1624, supplied his countrymen with models the German language lacked - and he did it by translating: sonnets from Ronsard's French, an idyll from Theocritus, odes of his own in the manner of Pindar. The pastoral novel was brought into Germany from Italy, the picareseque from Spain, the heroic from England, France, Spain, and Italy. Handbooks of poetics urged would-be poets to get better at their own tongue by translating. Ronsard, so Opitz said, spent twelve years at Greek, the better to write his own French. The poet, like a journeyman, should go abroad and learn. Particular verse forms, studied in a literal or figurative 'abroad', were transplanted to the native soil, where they thrived or failed. The alexandrine line came into German from French via Dutch in the early seventeenth century, and survived for 150 years. Surrey, translating Virgil, brought the iambic pentameter into English, to serve for the Latin hexameter. 5 Coleridge, Poetical Works , edited by J. C. C.

German translators of Tibullus and Propertius helped naturalize the elegiac couplet for Goethe, Schiller, and Holderlin to refine and make entirely their own. Translators help the nation in the making of a national literature. Germany - or rather, since before 1871 there was no such nation, the German-speaking territories in Europe - more than once invented a vernacular literature, most drastically in the seventeenth century, when the language itself was degraded by the multilingual invading armies of the Thirty Years' War, but again a hundred years later in a revolt against the nearly overwhelming language and culture of France. In that struggle also, whose result was the triumph of the so- called Goethezeit, foreign models were called in as allies for a German literature against the French: Shakespeare against Racine, Corneille and Voltaire; Homer and Ossian against everything civil, urbane, polite, which is to say, French. German came into its own by combating one foreign culture felt to be tyrannical and by alliances with others, just as foreign, felt to be liberating. What constitutes 'one's own' can only be learned in more or less hostile or friendly dealings with abroad. The late eighteenth century, so full of violent 'contraries', threw up an ambivalent force by its recovery and idealization of the classical past. On the one hand this ideal was strongly revolutionary. Holderlin, for example, explicitly associated the French armies after Valmy with the democratic Athenians in their fight against the autocratic Persians. But in the arts the ideal easily became repressive. Like no other artistic period, Periclean Athens seemed to later generations to have achieved 'the one true style', which allowed all latter-day artists nothing but antiquarianism and slavish imitation. Holderlin, who got nearer to the Greeks than any of his contemporaries, internalized the dilemma as a matter of life and death. His hero Hyperion, a Greek who fights in the abortive uprising of 1770 against the Turks, is overwhelmed by the very thought of the civilization which by his fighting he hopes to revive: Who can withstand it, whom does the terrible splendour of the ancient world not cast down, when it seizes him, as it did me, like a hurricane tearing up forests of young trees, and when he lacks, as I do, the very element from which a strengthening self-identity might have been derived? (HI, 18) And in the draft of an essay entitled 'The point of view from which we should regard the Ancient World', Holderlin wrote: 92</page><page sequence="15">Translation and Literature 20 (201 1) We seem really to have no other option: either to be crushed beneath the weight of the received and the positive, or, with a violent presumption, to pit one's self as a living force against everything learned, given and positive. (IV, 221) The peril and the salvation are there. To achieve his own self-identity he must revolt 'as a living force, against an idolized foreign culture remote in space and time, and indeed against its 'dead' language, Greek. But without that culture and that language he can gain no self- identity. He must serve them, and revolt for the salvation of himself and his art in the here and now. There was, as already noted, much constraint, revolt, and striving for autonomy in Holderlin's own life. His mother, in her anxious parsimony; the Church authorities in their claim on his services; the uneasy office of house-tutor; all threatened and hindered him in his bids for a life he could call his own. But it is in his relationship with Schiller that Holderlin's struggle can most clearly be seen as concerning his vocation as poet. His mother, the Church, his employment were concerned in it too in that they denied him or threatened the financial freedom he needed in which to write; but Schiller was, in person, an idol and an authority like the ancient world itself, against which Holderlin had either to revolt 'as a living force' or perish. He loved and revered Schiller as a fellow-Swabian poet, author of Die Rauber and Don Carlos , in revolt against an oppressive order and driven into exile as a consequence. Schiller looked after Holderlin, getting him the job in Waltershausen, helping him at the university and in literary circles in Jena, publishing his poems, introducing him to to a publisher for Hyperion - but he was critical and wary of him too, as a younger, more extreme and unstable alter ego, the elegiac character helplessly at odds with the ugliness of modernity; and in the end he dropped him. Holderlin, for his part, courted Schiller - and fled when his own psyche, desperate for autonomy, could take no more: 'I am overwhelmingly dependent on you' (VI, 241). 'I am sometimes in a secret struggle with your genius, to safeguard my freedom against it, and the fear of being utterly governed by you has often prevented me from approaching you with a cheerful composure' (VI, 273). Holderlin's Pindar translations are an act of extreme subordination of the native tongue under a foreign original which had, for him, the status of Holy Writ: indeed, they rather resemble interlinear versions of the Bible done as closely as possible in the belief that God's word must be transposed syllable by syllable, to lose none of it in the passage. 93</page><page sequence="16">David Constantine/Holderlin , Poet-Translator He seems quite intentionally to have risked annihilating his language, which is to say, as poet, his self-identity, by subsuming it into the foreign. In practice this means that for long stretches the translations are unintelligible as German without a knowledge of the Greek they have come out of. The procedure - cleaving as close as possible to the original - is mechanical. Holderlin, the most lyrical of poets, was fascinated by the mechanics that make a lyric poem work; and in these Pindar translations he seems to have been testing out the hypothesis that through them, mechanically, a German might be produced that would serve his own unique lyric purposes. Now and then in this colossal undertaking he must have felt with satisfaction that his instinct, a belief in the essential kinship of the two beloved languages, was right. For there are passages, not many but perhaps enough, in which by this mechanical means a German is achieved that has the tone, the syntax, the ghostly foreignness he wanted for himself.6 This poet apparently courting self-destruction, in fact, deep down, sensed very well what he was after for his art. Holderlin early on knew himself to be 'more destructible than others' (VI, 290) and in the relentless stuggle of that sensibility with the material circumstances assailing it he often in his personal life felt nullified. 'Res nullius,, he called himself in a letter to Schiller, having fled him. 'I belong to you/ he wrote, 'at least as a nothing' (VI, 181). But in poetry he knew what he must do, and he did it with a savage concentration till his mind collapsed. The Pindar translations are a sort of ordeal, a necessary passage, along the way. Perhaps out of the tangles of the work in progress he made a fair copy because once he was through it he knew he had the makings of the language of all his later poems, and prominent among them the great 'Pindaric' hymns that address the times and his motherland. Through translation Holderlin came into the free use of his own poetic language - through service into autonomy. Then, sure of that autonomy, he used his language to serve , in the ways that are peculiar to poetry. In the letter to Bohlendorff quoted from above, Holderlin's thesis is that cultures never excel at what is natural to them but at some necessary complementary or opposing characteristic they have fetched from abroad. So, in the case of the Greeks, that for which thery are chiefly renowned, Attic clarity, poise, precision, is not in fact their national innate quality - they made it theirs in opposition to what was innately theirs, which, in Holderlin's view, was 'the fire of 6 See, for example, his Pythian 3, 22-30; Pythian 9, 77-87; Pythian 8, 135-39. 1 have written on this at greater length in 'Holderlin's Pindar' (n. 3), pp. 828-33. 94</page><page sequence="17">Translation and Literature 20 (201 1) heaven', an ecstatic wildness he later called 'Oriental' (Nietzsche came to a similar insight in his Birth of Tragedy). Translating Oedipus and Antigone , Holderlin thought it his responsibility to bring out the fire that Sophocles, master of Attic poise, had repudiated or overcome. And why? Because his German readership, whose native characteristic was, he thought, 'sobriety' (a duller version of what the Greeks acquired), needed fire from abroad to enliven them. Germany, in a dynamic relationship with the ancient world, must learn from them the quality they were born with, had in abundance, and overcome: namely the liveliness which Germans, born too sober (pedantic, hidebound, too much in the letter not the spirit), lack. Holderlin explained his procedure to his publisher Friedrich Wilmans, first in September 1803, before his final revision of the translation: 'I hope to present it [Greek art] to the public in a more lively way than usual by accentuating its oriental strain which it repudiated' (VI, 434). Then in April 1804, having corrected the proofs: 'I believe I have written thoroughly towards [that is, deliberately bringing out] eccentric enthusiasm' (VI, 439). What Wilmans made of this explanation is anybody's guess. 'Das Eigene' ('one's own') is the characteristic a nation is born with. The free use of it is only achievable by bringing in a 'contrary' (to use Blake's word) from abroad. The progression set in train by this encounter results in a new thing, most one's own. That at least is Holderlin's progression as poet-translator. He makes a language unmistakably and uniquely his own by passage through the fires of Greek. Â¥ Â» Â» In November 1798 Holderlin wrote to Neuffer that he was chiefly occupied with the question of 'liveliness in poetry' ('das Lebendige'; VI, 289). And in December 1803 he told Wilmans that he had delayed sending in his Sophocles because the language of his Antigone did not yet feel 'lively enough' (VI, 435). Remembering his earlier comment to Neuffer about not being 'so impassioned' when working on a translation, and Coleridge's similar comment on his Wallenstein , we see him now, on the very brink of madness, working at and abundantly achieving in a translation the 'liveliness' he thought no poem could work without, and that he thought his countrymen lacked and needed for a life worthy the name: actually conjuring up the oriental, the fire from heaven, the eccentric enthusiasm which he thought they and the poem needed, and which would be his own undoing. 'Eccentric', in Holderlin's usage, retains much of its literal sense - deviating from the fixed and usual centre. But in the Pindar translations, under all 95</page><page sequence="18">David Constantine/ Holderlin, Poet-Translator the self-denial there remained a core of purpose and set intent. He held on. And in the eccentric course of his Antigone translation, in all the poetry written in the last two years before the clinic and the tower, there is again and again the injunction to hold on, to remain fixed and earth-bound. One could compile a substantial anthology from Holderlin' s poems and translations, of lines acknowledging or even soliciting eccentric wildness, and others urging and embodying the need to hold on. But in the end the pull towards disintegration won. Oedipus' crime, in Holderlin's understanding, is less the killing of Laius and marriage with Jocasta than the insane desire to know. He characterized that desire as 'idiot-frenetic' (V, 199) and translated the play accordingly. So Oedipus by forensic questioning causes things to be uttered that never should be uttered, and in the end shows in himself, with his blinded eyes, a sight that never should be seen. Poetry makes manifest, it realizes, it incarnates things in the here and now. They may be unbearable things. What Holderlin undertakes in his Oedipus is tragically consonant with all his late work: conjuring up what, for his sanity, he must fend off. 'King Oedipus has an eye too many perhaps' (II, 373). He sees too much. 'Consciousness . . . incites itself to know more than it can bear or comprehend' (V, 198). In September 1806 Holderlin was forcibly removed from Homburg and delivered into the clinic in Tubingen. He was discharged nine months later, with 'at most three years to live', into the care of a carpenter's family in a tower overlooking the Neckar. And there he remained, well looked after, till his death in 1843. So for the whole latter half of his long life Holderlin was at home. Metaphorically however - which is to say, in truth - he remained abroad. Frequently in letters to his mother, his sister, his half-brother, Holderlin writes of his longing to be with them, at home; but in his poems, including those that imagine and celebrate the homeland, he acknowledges how hard it would be to return there. Of Swabia, the motherland, he says, 'Unfriendly and hard to win | Is the mother I come from, and shut' (II, 141). Setting off on his Winterreise to Bordeaux in December 1801 he wrote to his half-brother Karl, 'Never in my life was I so attached to my country and never in my life have I so valued, and been so reluctant to leave, the company of my friends and relations. But I feel I am better outside [draufien]' And (on the same day) to Bohlendorff, 'Now I am full of farewell. I have not wept for a long time. But when I decided to leave my country, perhaps for ever, then I wept, and bitterly. For what do I have in the world that is dearer to me? But I am no use to them' (VI, 424, 427-8). 96</page><page sequence="19">Translation and Literature 20 (201 1) Holderlin came into his own language, and that language was taken by his countrymen as proof of his alienation. Aliene , the French say: insane. The language he reached through Sophocles excited derision. Heinrich Voss (son of the great translator of Homer) read bits of Antigone aloud to Goethe and Schiller and reported to a friend, 'You should have seen how Schiller laughed!' (VII. ii, 304). Holderlin's 'Nachtgesange', published in Wilmans' Taschenbuch the following year, likewise caused only bafflement and mirth. At least six of the nine poems were rewritings - really, interlinear translations - of earlier poems into late language. For that publication, in the winter of 1803-4 when he was making his translation of Antigone 'livelier', Holderlin also translated his own poems, into a language his few readers thought utterly foreign. Before long in the tower Holderlin ceased writing like that, and wrote rhyming quatrains instead, mostly to order for curious visitors who wanted them as keepsakes. He signed them 'Your humble servant, Scardanelli' and added entirely fictitious dates. In the year before his death, being presented with an edition of his poems, he glanced through them and said, 'Yes, the poems are genuine, I wrote them. But the name has been changed. I was never called Holderlin. I was called Scardanelli or Scarivari or Salvator Rosa, things like that' (VII. iii, 300). Truly, Holderlin died like Ajax in der Fremd , abroad - in a tower under the Stift where he was educated, and overlooking the river he was born on. Robert Graves, in his poem 'From the Embassy', gives himself, as poet, the title 'ambassador of Otherwhere' and calls the currency (or language) of his country 'Otherwhereish'. The language of poetry is always foreign. It has to be, to serve. Only if it comes from Otherwhere will it have any purchase on us, and be able to affect the lives we really live. Holderlin went abroad believing that to his countrymen, his fellow-German-speakers, he was no use. That grieved him. Because, of course, he wanted the free use of his own tongue, and went abroad to get it, not for his own good but to learn and to serve. He came fully into his powers at the turn of the century, in war and with his prospects of personal happiness fast diminishing to nothing. He wrote for love and community, having neither, keeping alive for others, for us still today, the passionate hope of both. The Queens College , Oxford 97</page></plain_text>
