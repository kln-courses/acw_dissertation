Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994. xv + 321 pp. Illustrations, appendixes, notes, bibliography, and index. $45.00 (cloth); $17.95 (paper). Humorist Robert Benchley told of a bright but unprepared student who, when tested on the Canadian-American conflict over Newfoundland fishing rights, wrote that the dispute had sometimes been seen from the Canadian perspective, and sometimes from the American, but that he was going to look at it from the viewpoint of the fish! That is the clever spirit which animates Robert E. Kohler's Lords of the Fly. Kohler's study recounts the pioneering genetics research of the Thomas H. Morgan laboratory at Columbia University and California Institute of Tech- nology from roughly 1907 to 1942. Kohler downplays intellectual history and focuses instead on the daily work and lifestyle of the experimentalists, particularly the material culture and craft of the lab. His book is unique in that its laboratory instrument was a living being, Drosophila melanogaster, com- monly known as the fruit fly. The fact that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office recently issued the first patent on a genetically altered mouse suggests that this is a concept whose time has come.' Over the centuries, fruit flies became semi-domesticated by clustering around orchards, wineries, and garbage piles to feast on the decaying plants and fruit. Their cultivation by scientists was not a drastic step, Kohler claims, because "laboratories and landscapes are not such different places as may appear" (p. 10). Throughout the book Kohler portrays the flies not as passive objects but as active participants. Kohler's Drosophila is a "co-worker" (p. 1), "fellow laborer" (p. 23), and "active players" (p. 19) in the experiments. His flies are "colonizers" of the lab (p. 50) which "take over" the experiments (p. 44). They "happily bred year-round in the warmth of college labs" (p. 34) in their "cozy, protected mailing tubes" (p. 53). Thus this is probably the first history book in which people share the limelight with flies. Kohler brings impressive credentials to the study. He earned his Ph.D. in chemistry and spent three years at the bench in Harvard microbiology labs. Since 1973 he has been professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Depart- Reviews in American History 23 (1995) 302-306 ? 1995 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">NOVAK I Of Flies and Men 303 ment of History and Sociology of Science. His first book, From Medical Chemistry to Biochemistry: The Making of a Scientific Discipline (1982), traced the rise of biochemistry in the United States with a focus on academic history and academic politics. His next book, Partners in Science: Foundations and Natural Scientists, 1900-1945 (1991), emphasized academic economics and how out- side funding sources have shaped recent scientific research. His present book draws from a wide range of scientific journals and archives, following the trail of Drosophila research. Drosophila entered university biology labs in 1901 at Harvard when academic biology was shifting from natural science field work to indoor laboratory experiments. Animals were newcomers to universities. In the mid- 1890s, for example, Harvard had refused to allot campus space to Edward L. Thorndike for his dissertation research on chickens, forcing him to do the work in Professor William James's basement. Kohler speculates that Droso- phila was originally admitted to the lab because of its utility for undergradu- ate assignments. They were hardy, had a two-week reproduction cycle, and were capable of producing hundreds of offspring. At first the scientists working with the flies considered them nasty pests, but they became more appreciative as the flies revealed their marvelous experimental utility. The flies entered the lab just after Mendel's genetics theories were redis- covered in 1900, and the earliest known Drosophila experiments were attempts to produce evolutionary mutants by environmental heat, cold, chemicals, centrifuging, x-rays, and intense inbreeding. Morgan's lab at Columbia launched such experiments in 1907. Two years later, after hundreds of generations, still with nothing to show for their work, the scientists suddenly found the mutant with, followed in rapid succession by a flood of other mutants. Although Morgan erroneously attributed the genetic alterations to inbreeding, Kohler explains that these were actually spontaneous mutations that only became visible now because of the large scale of the experiments and the investigators' more careful observations. The success of the experi- ment was less due to the humans than to the flies' fecundity in mating and mutating. Excited by the mutations, the Morgan team launched new experiments, both to design a "standard" laboratory fly whose alterations could be controlled and to apply Mendel's laws to the mutations. They succeeded in making Drosophila a laboratory tool though not in validating Mendelian genetics. The avalanche of mutations buried Mendel's simple, bipolar system of dominant and recessive genes. Embarrassed by the lab's inability to explain the results, graduate students Alfred H. Sturtevant and Calvin B. Bridges set out in 1912 to classify Drosophila chromosomes 2 and 3. After two years of intense labor, they invented the technique known as genetic mapping whereby</page><page sequence="3">304 REVIEWS IN AMERICAN HISTORY / JUNE 1995 the position of genes on chromosomes are measured statistically by the rate of gene recombination-a major breakthrough in modern genetics. Kohler gives a sense of the labor involved by estimating that the maps of 1923 depended on the examination of over 10 million flies. His account of the development of these techniques makes fascinating reading, as does the description of the day-to-day maintenance of the flies. Drosophila also shaped genetics research by its limitations. The built-in constraints of its genetic system frustrated many subsequent experimental efforts. For instance, Drosophila was a failure in cytogenetic and phylogenetic experiments, leaving investigators the choice of abandoning their approach or abandoning the fly. George W. Beadle took the latter option in 1941 when he shifted to Neurospora fungi for biochemical genetics. The fact that so many stuck with the fly so long shows that scientists do shape their research to fit the power of their tools. The fly's last act, before its revival as a molecular biology tool in the seventies, was in the late thirties when Theodosius Dobzhansky, an energetic outdoorsman, reintroduced thousands of wild flies into the lab that he had gathered from collecting expeditions all over the continent. This new influx could now be classified more rapidly by salivary chromosome cytology. Once again, by expanding the scale, investigators could make a major break- through, in this case tracing the evolutionary history of Drosophila in diverse geographical regions, the kind of evolutionary genetics which Morgan had originally hoped to explore. Kohler depicts the people in the lab-the drosophilists-as a technological cohort. He analyzes their interrelations in terms of E. P. Thompson's "moral economy": "how unstated moral rules define the mutual expectations and obligations of the various participants in the production process" (p. 12). That is, participants had an innate sense of what was equitable. Morgan was quick to share information and fly stock with competitors because he believed that drawing more scientists into the field would elevate the significance of Drosophilia research. At first the Morgan lab set the standards and served as a clearinghouse of information and stock, but by the thirties the University of Texas and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory had developed major fly collec- tions. Although the rise of new fly groups intensified competition and conflicts, leading to charges of trespassing and poaching, rivalries were by and large kept within bounds by acceptance of the moral economy of the exchange system. Kohler also applies the concept of the moral economy to the Morgan lab itself. The scientists came from disparate backgrounds, though little is told about their prior lives and education. They were quickly acclimated into the messy, aggressive, bantering, masculine ethos of the lab. Within the lab, work</page><page sequence="4">NOVAK / Of Flies and Men 305 was collective, with credit going to those who most quickly finished projects and published the results. The elite drosophilists commonly received their Ph.D.'s between 1914 and 1917, while those who earned doctorates later often had to settle for becoming biology teachers. One of the defining traits of Morgan's researchers was that they were not professors and did not teach undergraduates. The drosophilists were something new in academic history. Although known as the "fly room," the Morgan lab was basically a small research institute. The lab was financed by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and Sturtevant and Bridges were officially Carnegie research "associates." Carnegie funding began in 1914 and ended in 1941, a year after Morgan's retirement, when the grant was not renewed. Given Kohler's prior work on foundations, I wish he had included more about Morgan's relations with Carnegie grant managers. It would be interesting to know how Carnegie officials perceived the lab's progress and why they dropped their support. There is no doubt that the lab's soft-money status weakened its esprit de corps. Kohler portrays Morgan as autocratic, tightfisted, chronically uneasy with outside funding, and, despite the lab's much-heralded success, hesitant to build a research empire. His failings as an administrator contributed to the lab's decline. Kohler understands scientists and writes as an insider. The drosophilists were motivated, he says, by the excitement of productive research: "It is the work itself that drives the work" (p. 4). He acknowledges that the competitive atmosphere sometimes created tensions in the lab, and these stresses deserve more attention. For example, Sturtevant and Bridges reportedly were the ones who achieved the major scientific breakthroughs of the lab, yet Kohler neglects to explain why Morgan alone received the Nobel Prize in 1933. Nor do we find out why Morgan transplanted the lab to Caltech in 1928, despite the fact that it was supposedly "a wrenching experience for everyone" (p. 125). Although such omissions are relevant, Kohler's intention was not to write a complete history of the lab but to create the new analytic and methodologi- cal tool of material culture. "Historians," he writes, "like scientists, are inventors of machines that generate problems" (p. xiv). Insofar as Lords of the Fly provides historians with a new tool, it deserves to be widely read and discussed. It is a subtle, sophisticated, provocative work which may serve as a model for many fields of history. Despite the book's originality, Kohler's treatment romanticizes the lab, particularly the role of the happy, thriving flies in their cozy milk bottles. Somewhere we lose sight of the fact that this was a laboratory designed to produce mutations. Some mutations were produced by radiation. Once</page><page sequence="5">306 REVIEWS IN AMERICAN HISTORY / JUNE 1995 scientists learned to transplant imaginal discs, mutant flies sprouted extra eyes growing on their abdomens or legs growing out of their eyes. Herman J. Muller explained in his 1946 Nobel Prize address that the "overwhelming majority" of Drosophila mutations were "always harmful," "detrimental to its proper functioning. "2 While the flies were indeed laboratory tools whose biological systems shaped the lab, it seems unnecessary and odd for Kohler to portray them in such anthropomorphic terms as happy, active partners. Trivializing their fate distorts the reality of the laboratory. What was stimulating for humans was stultifying for flies. Today's geneticists complain that in gene knockout experiments on mice and flies it is sometimes difficult to measure functional loss not only because of genetic redundancy but because the animals have previously been rendered dysfunctional by living so long in cages or bottles. In that sense, the title Lords of the Fly is not just a clever pun but an accurate description of man's power over laboratory animals. Steven J.
