<plain_text><page sequence="1">IITUAL RI ALITY, TRAGIC IMITATION, MYTHIC PIOIJECTIUN Rene Girard LA VIOLENCE ET LE SACRE Paris: Grasset, 1972 Western literature lives under the aegis of tragedy. Its model works of literary art and criticism are Sophocles' Oedipus The King and Aristotle's Poetics. That the Poetics has been reduced to that portion dealing with Sophocles' play dramatizes the hold of tragedy on the Western imagination. Existentially, this hold has a certain verifiability-and not only for modern man who witnesses on television, at each day's crepuscule, the data of tragedy's central concerns: death, blindness, exile and other "violence" that men inflict upon each other or suffer as part of "how it is." Destroyed by death, man has always memorialized his destruction in institutions that at once acknowledge and transcend that destruction. Confronting this "at-once-ness," most men have regarded it as a polarity to be resolved in favor of the transcendence. Thus, critical discourse on the subject since Aristotle can be divided into two main currents. Once current is what we can call "external transcendence": the destruction of man is justified through the attribution of fault to an exemplary individual. Thus Aristotle with his theory of "tragic error" [hamartia] and Reinhold Niebuhr with his concept of "sin" [Beyond Tragedy: Essays on the Christian Interpretation of History (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1937)]. The external transcendence is patent enough with Niebuhr. With Aristotle, it is true that hamartia can be understood as blameworthy error, a defect over which the erroneous figure could have exercised some control. However, as S. H. Butcher has shown in his comments on the matter, this interpretation yields (very likely with Oedipus in mind) to an overriding moral sense [Aristotle's Theory of Poetry and Fine Art, tr. and with critical notes by S. H. Butcher, 4th ed. (New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1951), p. 319]. The English translation of hamartia as "flaw," a metaphor of geological processes, responds to this "transcendentalist" sense in Aristotle. The error/flaw as part of the way things are underlies H. D. F. Kitto's interpretation of Oedipus' anger as a "disturbance" in the metaphysical order of the universe, to be removed by the process of tragedy, thus restoring the universe to its equilibrium [Greek Tragedy: A Literary Study (New York: Doubleday &amp; Co., Inc. Anchor Books, 1954), pp. 151-55]. Later commentators on Aristotle will wonder about the justice of blaming Oedipus for what he obviously cannot himself help and some will wonder if the hero's "flaw" is a flaw. Such doubts prick at another Aristotelian category, catharsis through "terror and pity." Pierre Corneille would replace it by admiration of the hero. But for Aristotle the emotions appropriate to tragedy, the mechanism of catharsis, have less to do with the hero than with the "order of things," perceived through the mimesis/action of the play. As Whitney J. Oates, Jr. would have it in the "General Introduction" to The Complete Greek Drama [New York: Random House, 1938]: "Aristotle does not use the word in its primary usage of 'copying,' but rather . . . seems to mean the process which takes place when an artist creates his work of art" [I, xxiii]. Neverthe- less, copying cannot be separated from Aristotle's usage, as we can see in the ethical function he assigns to tragedy: the catharsis through pity and terror. The work of art is not self-enclosed, but is didactically referential to an "order of things" in whose terms men should behave. The other current of resolution of the death/transcendence duality can be called "internal transcendence." This current does not blink the fact of death (or its analogues) but neither does it justify death through "blame," individual or col- lective. Rather, it "transcends" man's fate through therapeutic conceptions of the relations between the characters. The more literal-minded therapists see the "char- acters" of tragedies as representation of real people, to be "studied" transactionally or in Jungian perspectives or in their "relations" in public and private a la Erving Goffman, etc. For such critics, tragedy is a case-book of adaptive psychology (a series of "dont's" rather than "do's.") The anthropocentric focus of these critics casts some doubt as to whether they are genuinely "transcendental" in their thematics. However, in positing counter-models of behavior for the "mistaken" protagonists of tragedy, they manifest a kind of misplaced transcendentalism. More sophisticated therapists in this current regard the "characters" of tragedy as "elements" in the histrionic structure-like words in a poem. Oedipus, Tiresias, ROBERT J. NELSON Robert J.

He is presently working on a study of Pascal's religious development. dikcritics/Summer 1976 41</page><page sequence="2">etc. are what might be called "charamemes" in the intratextual play of the tragic "acteme." There are traces (social, political, psychological, etc.) of real or "extra- textual" people in these charamemes but these references are stylized to tell a self- sufficient story, not to "reflect," preventively or curatively, man's behavior. Where, then, lies the "therapy" and the "transcendence?" In the consolation and exaltation of art. As Pirandello, his own critic in the Preface to Six Characters in Search of an Author, tells us: "All that lives, by the fact of living, has a form, and by the same token must die-except the work of art which lives forever in so far as it is form" [Naked Masks: Five Plays by Luigi Pirandello, ed. Eric Bentley (New York: E. P. Dut- ton &amp; Co., Inc., 1952), p. 372 tr. Eric Bentley]. Art triumphs over death-and life itself. This triumph is man's, not God's or some other metaphysical order's. This may lead us to question its "transcendental" value, but it is, psychologically, a transcen- dence, the surmounting of a seemingly futile confrontation with death. It is an in- stance of man the triumphant self-maker through language, tragedy, art. Hence the appropriate tragic emotion is neither "pity" nor "terror" nor a combination of both, but that emotion which James Joyce links inseparably and uniquely to the imagina- tion: "Beauty, the splendor of truth, is a gracious presence when the imagination contemplates intensely the truth of its own being or the visible world, and the spirit which proceeds out of truth and beauty is the spirit of joy" [From Joyce's essay on Clarence Mangan, quoted by Herbert Gorman. James Joyce, (New York: Rinehart, 1948), p. 80-my emphasis]. The emotion seems more appropriate to comedy than to tragedy, but in such a thematics tragedy still prevails, for the comic is synonymous with the ridiculous and the counterpart of the "tragic hero" with his "flaw" is the "comic butt" with his "foibles." The dictionary reflects this hierarchy: a foible, [Webster's Third New International Dictionary (Springfield, Mass.: G. &amp; C. Merriam Co., 1965] is "a minor flaw or shortcoming in personal character or behavior" [my emphasis]. Criticism has assimilated comedy into tragedy chiefly by stressing the satirical and limited func- tion of comedy: we can't "correct" the fundamental tragic situation of man, we can make a work-a-day correction of his social vices. When geniuses as disturbing as Moliere come along to suggest that these "minor flaws" are as incorrigible as tragic hamartia, the only solution is to assimilate theory of comedy into theory of tragedy. Thus, psychocriticism with its pursuit of the Oedipus complex-the nuclear tragic theme-in Moliere's parent/children figures. Tragedy and tragic theory reign supreme. Even generalized theories of literary (and other) art are subsumed in its categories, including theories based on an "independent" esthetic function. Here, reference to other human institutions as models are misapplied metaphors, postponing if not deflecting the study of art from its essential concern with how the art work works, with the intrinsic structure as a self-referential system. The appropriate emotional reaction to this "auton- omous" system is at worst a relativistic humility before the complexities of human expression, at best a self-gratulating exultation in the perception itself. Pirandellian and Joycean joy once again. To all this, in La Violence et le sacre, Rene Girard says: "no, in thunder!" Readers of Diacritics have heard some of this thunder in portions of the book trans- lated in a previous number (11, 2, 1972) and in applications of its thesis to a broad spectrum of modern criticism in a later number ["Levi-Strauss, Frye, Derrida and Shakespearean Criticism," III, 3, 1973]. More specifically addressed to literature, the latter essay points to an aspect of Girard's concerns in the book obscured by the primarily anthropological focus of the portions translated in this journal earlier: the centrality of literature and particularly of tragedy. If Girard arrays an impressive erudition from the fields of the "human" and the "hard" sciences, it is to bring it to bear on the nuclear preoccupation of literature with tragedy and criticism of tragedy. Resolutely referential, he elaborates throughout a distinction between the tragic ex- perience and its mise en evidence in the plays of various dramatists (Sophocles and Euripides in particular) through a contrapuntal study of the plays, on the one hand, and on the other, of other institutions confronting the "tragic" reported by anthro- pologists, ethnologists, psychiatrists, historians, etc. on a wide diversity of cultures (Western, African, American-Indian, Asian, etc.). The book is thus at once a "crit- icism" of tragedy (literature) and a "meta-criticism" of theories of tragedy (theories of literature). These "reporters" are at best witnesses to the central perception Girard elab- orates. None gives sufficient testimony and too many would mistakenly erect them- selves as well into judges-including those, like the Freud of Totem and Taboo, whom Girard most respects as he wends his way through The Human Tragedy. But, like Dante in a similar quest (and here, too, one senses his essentially literary pre- occupation) Girard is not without his Virgil-or Virgils: the great writers [ecrivains] r 42</page><page sequence="3">whom not only these other "non-literary" witnesses but also, in a complicity that appalls Girard [pp. 283-84], literary critics have dismissed too readily. But what else can one expect from all litterateurs and human scientists: their very metier is anchored in culture, the realm of differentiation. Their very insightfulness subjects them to a blindness to the undifferentiated, the very "model" their cultural dif- ferentiations are designed to deny. All cultural activity for Girard, particularly that current of it described above as internal transcendence, tends toward scholasticism, a dead-end of intrinsic speculation in which the initial preoccupation with the sacred is lost. "When the tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?" For Girard, the fall of that sempiternal tree may not be heard, but the tree does fall. Or, to refer to a referent cited by Girard in this journal: "the difference between (the) real eagle and (the) real crow is a part of nature before and above being a part of our minds" ["Levi-Strauss," 35]. Like Pascal derisively reassuring Descartes tormented by the re- gressive pursuit of a "truly first" principle, Girard counters with his "first sentiment" that there is something out there or, in more critical terms, the text of tragedy does point to a "real" that no amount of intrinsic and inevitable critical deconstruction can metonymize out of existence. What is this "something out there?" It is the violence of the sacred, the violence which is the sacred: If we try to summarize all the subjects approached in this essay, we are obliged to entitle them: Violence and the Sacred. This impersonal perception [apprehension] is fundamental. In Africa, for example, as everywhere else, there is only one and the same word to designate the two faces of the sacred, the play of order and cul- tural disorder, of difference lost and difference recovered, such as we have seen it unfold, in the immutable drama of the incestuous and sacrificed monarch. This word qualifies, on the one hand, all royal transgressions, all forbidden as well as proscribed sexual practices, all forms of violence and brutality, unclean things lies choses sales], rot, all monstrous forms, as well as kinship quarrels [les querelles entre proches], bitterness, envy, jealousy . . . and it qualifies, on the other hand, creative and constructive fordonnatrice] vigor, stability and serenity. All polarized meanings [toutes les significations opposees] are to be brought back to [se retrouvent dans] the mechanism fjeul, but this very mechanism fjeul can unfold as well outside of royalty. To understand royalty one must relate it to the sacred, but the sacred exists outside of royalty. [pp. 356-57-my translation. Hereafter, translations from the book are mine.] For Christian thinkers and secular Humanists alike this conception is paradoxical: the sacred is not the redemption of violence, but the realm of violence. To a certain extent, some of Girard's "witnesses" have perceived this, but, in an inevitable dif- ferential/cultural habit, they have transformed their perception into reductive social and religious systems.1 Thus, the Freud of La Psychologie collective et I'analyse du moi, who perceived that the nuclear tragedy of the Oedipus complex lay not in the child's imitation of the father's desire for the mother but in the child's general- ized imitation of the father. The pathogenic desire for the mother is but a later instance of this initially neutral mimesis. Similarly, the Freud of Totem and Taboo perceived (1) the particular application of this sequence in his questionings of the Aristotelian notion of the "tragic flaw" and (2) the probing significance of the "founding murder" [le lynchage fondateur] of the pharmakon by the other mem- bers of society. But, caught in the individualizing (culturally differentiating) current of the scapegoat [le bouc emissaire] hypothesis characterizing Western thought, Freud restored priority to the pathogenic desire for the mother while allowing the neutral mimesis to function as the crucial mechanism in superego relations. Readers of Girard's earlier Deceit, Desire and the Novel: Self and Other in Literary Structure [tr. Yvonne Freccero (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1965)] will recognize here the reprise of the major thesis of that book: the mimetic working of desire in a vertical or external [exterieure] transcendence, on the one hand, and, on the other, a horizontal or diverted [deviee] transcendence. Freud's final and, by Girard's lights in the present book, erroneous conception of the Oedipus complex is an example of a horizontal transcendence. In this connection, the Girard of the earlier book might himself be considered an instance of a different if not erroneous perception. In that book, the exemplary hero is seen as finally opting for an unmediated transcendence, the surrender of self to a beyond which is the domain of peace [repos]. In the new book, man cannot and, indeed, must not surrender to the beyond, for it is not the final "resting" place but the place of vi- olence itself. One can only have recourse to the mediation of religion [le religieux] which "has the mechanism of the scapegoat as its object: its function is to per- petuate or to renew the effects of this mechanism, that is to keep violence outside the community" [p. 135]. Felicien Rops Le P6che mortel [E863] 1Among the few witnesses whom Girard does not cite in his encyclo- pedic survey are Kitto (see above) and Gustave Lanson. In his Esquisse d'une histoire de la trag6die fran;aise [nou- velle edition revue et corrigee, Paris: Librairie Ancienne Honor6 Champion, 1954 (original edition, 1920)], Lanson elaborates a distinction between the experiential category of the tragic Ile tragiquel and the esthetic category of tragedy fla trag;diel. However, neither Kitto nor Lanson anticipate Girard's notion of the reciprocity of violence in the experience of the tragic and, to a lesser extent, in tragedy. 43 diacritics/summer 1976</page><page sequence="4">Felicien Rops Les Diaboliques [E505] The religious manifests itself ideally for Girard in ritual but suggestively in the art and myth as well. The order is hierarchy: ritual, art, myth. But not consistently. Girard is ambivalent toward art, in particular. On the one hand, as already noted, he prizes the insights of the writer (in English: the creative writer or literary artist) over those of other "writers" on the human condition. In addition to Sophocles and Euripides who are central here, he returns to exemplars cited in his earlier work: Stendhal, Dostoievsky, Kafka, Proust, Shakespeare, Cervantes. On the other hand, the individual works of the writer are subordinated to the insights we gain from more patent forms of the religious, particularly ritual. In this relative disprisal of the work of art, one senses that Girard is quarreling less with art than with the nar- rowly holistic mind-set of the critical tradition, with its anthropomorphic and romanticizing identification of the individual writer and the critic who "fully" com- prehends the "integrity" of the individual work through a mirror-like reconstruc- tion of it. Girard himself is concerned with a more comprehensive holism, with larger integrities. For him, the writer is a religious seer rather than an esthetic hero. However imperfectly, a Sophocles, a Euripides, a Shakespeare penetrates to the ground of human existence: the reciprocal violence arbitrarily menacing all human culture first perceived in an event recorded nowhere but universally commemorated in ritual and, now in this time of ritual deliquescence, in great art: the collective murder of the father. In this perception, art is superior to myth, for myth destroys the mutuality of violence by differentiating beween an innocent sacrificer and a guilty sacrificed. Tragedy (art) denies this difference: Tiresias is as culpable as Oedipus and the plague is a sign of the undifferentiated levelling of status. But, says Girard, if the sacrificial rite is a species of art in the eyes of the ethnologist Victor Turner, "the opposite must be true: the drama represented on the stage must con- stitute a species of ritual, the obscure repetition of the phenomenon of the religious" [p. 403]. Must? Yes, on the evidence from the world over, from time immemorial, that Girard has amassed in arriving at this summary formulation. For Girard, tragedy (art) is a relation, not a resolution. If he dismisses struc- turalists on the one hand, it is not to fall, on the other, into the hands of the an- imists and the mythicists of the Cambridge school. Myth projects a resolution of the fundamental polarity of the tragic that tragedy rightly, if obscurely, imitates. When tragedy moves on to such resolutions (the denouement of Hamlet, say), it only en- ters into what Girard might call, following Oscar Mandel, "post-tragic episodes" [A Definition of Tragedy (New York: New York University Press, 1961)]. Oedipus at Colonus is such a "post-tragic episode" for many critics, but for Girard it is only further evidence of the tragic polarity, for at Colonus Oedipus remains guilty. Even the second play of Sophocles smacks, too much for Girard I suspect, of a mythic decalcomania on the quintessentially tragic Oedipus The King. Thus, not even that masterpiece of religious perception can imitate as perceptively as ritual the essential violence [la violence essentielle], that hovers over humanity. As much as Oedipus at Colonus, the first play clings too closely to mythic projection: "always, in the final analysis, tragedy is situated within a mythic framework that is never completely de- stroyed. This tendentious character is however lesser in tragedy than in all other mythic and perhaps other cultural forms; the property of tragic inspiration, we have seen, is to recover the reciprocity of reprisal, to restore the symetry of violence, that is: to restore tendentiousness" [p. 281]. Like Freud in his perception of the neutral, generalized mechanism of mimetic desire, tragedy moves toward truth only finally to withdraw from it [p. 405]. If Sophocles resolves the reciprocity in favor of cultural order, of difference restored, his tendentiousness is only the other side of the coin on which the Euripides of The Bacchae resolves it in favor of untrammelled violence. Like ritual, myth, the oedipal situation and all else that is human, art, for Girard, is a referent in what might be called his concept of "referAnce." Like the interplay of linguistic differences in a derridian analysis of a poem, the different evidences that Girard collects in an amazing survey of world cultures interact non- genetically to create a conception that no single piece of evidence in itself or in partial interaction with other pieces can yield: the understanding of man. The sys- tem is self-sufficient. It is, paradoxically enough in light of Girard's thesis in Deceit, Desire and the Novel, immanentist rather than transcendental. But not anthropo- morphic: Aside from . . . "personalized" readings of the mechanism of violence, there is an impersonal reading. It corresponds to all that is covered in the term sacred [sacre] or better still, in Latin, sacer that we translate now by "sacred," now by "cursed" fmauditl, for it includes the maleficent as well as the beneficent. One finds analogous terms in the majority of languages: thus, the famous mana of the Melanesians, the waken of the Sioux, the orenda of the Iroquois, etc. In one connection at least, the language of sacer is the least deceptive, the least mythic of all since it postulates no master of the mechanism, no privileged 44</page><page sequence="5">intervention, not even of a superhuman being. The fact that sacer is conceivable beyond any anthropomorphic presence shows that any attempt to define the re- ligious by anthropomorphism or animism is a false trail. If the religious consisted in "humanizing" the non-human or endowing a "soul" on what does not have one, the impersonal perception of the sacred would not exist. [p. 356] The religious does not refer to some "order" beyond itself-of God or of the Gods, say. Nor is ritual a metaphor of the relation of the "sacred" and the "human"; it is, rather, a metonymy of that relation, a part of the whole to which it "refers." Does this conception hold together in Girard's presentation? There are hesi- tancies and logical lacunae. Hesitancies lie in (a) the value Girard places on the functions of the various cultural institutions man has forged to deal with the sacred (violence); and (b) the value of art over myth in apprehending the sacred. At the outset, Girard seems caught in a sequential, Comtean view of the prim- itive and the modern, the religious and the scientific: All the means ever instituted [mis en oeuvre] by men to protect themselves from interminable violence could very well be linked. One can group them in three categories: 1) preventive means that all come down to sacrificial detours [deviations] from the spirit of vengeance; 2) harnessings [amenagements] and fetterings [entraves] of vengeance, like compositions, judicial duels, etc., whose curative action is still precarious; 3) the judicial system whose curative efficacy is without equal. lp. 381 Although later Girard will rectify this Comtean valence (for example, in demonstrat- ing that such prime instances of "curative justice" as capital punishment are them- selves under the aegis of reciprocal violence-p. 413ff.), his general preoccupation with religion as the best institution for forfending the intrusion of sacred violence into the cultural is blunted by the sweeping claim here made for the judicial system. His hesitancy on the value-relation between art and myth is more crucial. Hav- ing elaborated fairly early [pp. 97ff.] the limited and presumably inferior status of myth in "tending" to the truth of reciprocal violence, he subordinates art to myth: we must not interpret the role of Sophocles as a new foundation [dotation], a sup- plement of meaning [as the critic Jean-Pierre Vernant has done] but on the contrary as an impoverishment, as the partial deconstruction of a sense always mythic, as much in contemporary psychology and sociology as in the myths of old. The poet does not "lend" any "new meaning" to the royal scapegoat, he returns more closely to the universal source of meanings [p. 157, in note concluding from p. 155-my emphasis]. This passage squares uneasily with the passage on the tragic that I quoted earlier: "this tendentious character is however lesser in tragedy than in all other mythic and perhaps other cultural forms" [p. 281]. If art is "richer," in being non-tendentious here, in the note on Vernant it appears to be "poorer" than myth. In the logic of the Vernant passage, myth seems closer to the "universal source of meanings" than ritual itself-a reading possible even in the passage on the "tendency" of tragedy if we are to understand ritual as one of the "cultural forms" that are more tenden- tious in their reduction of sacred reciprocity. As with the imputed Comtean valence of curative systems, this hesitancy can be reconciled with Girard's basic thesis: in the "tendency" passage he does say "perhaps other cultural forms" [my emphasis].2 Again, the Vernant passage can be read as another instance of Girard's over-reaction to critical interpretations whenever criticism and the religious intersect. Nevertheless, the hesitancy gnaws. The logical lacunae are still more problematic. All the more so for those who read them as inconsistencies. For example, although he stresses the impersonal, non-anthropomorphic operation of the mechanism of reciprocal violence, Girard gives no instances of such operations. To the contrary, he cites ethnological evidence of the limited violence of animals: unlike men, they do not fight to the death except for biological sustenance (and this outside the species): We know today that animals are individually provided with regulatory mech- anisms which dictate that [font que] combat is almost never to the death of the vanquished. With respect to such mechanisms which favor the perpetuation of the ' Even here Girard's use of "tenden- tiousness" [le tendancieux] remains potentially ambiguous. He praises tragedy for being less tendentious than other forms and "tragic inspira- tion" for restoring "the reciprocity of reprisal, the symmetry of violence, that is: to restore tendentiousness" [p. 281]. Obviously, the reader must make a distinction between "tragedy" and "tragic inspiration": tragedy tends to- ward an asymmetrical view of the tragic relation (restored unanimity in Sophocoles, the contagion of violence in Euripides); tragic inspiration tends toward the fuller representation of the reciprocity. diacritics/ummer 1976 Felicien Rops Eritis Similus Deo [E866] 45</page><page sequence="6">species, it is legitimate, undoubtedly, to use the word instinct. But it is absurd, then, to return to the same word to designate the fact that man, himself, is deprived of similar mechanisms [p. 203]. Animals figure so centrally in Girard's analysis of "ritual sacrifice" (for example, in his analogies between certain animal victims and their "social" connections with the relatively indifferent human victims in ritual sacrifices) that one wishes he had elucidated this contrast between the animal and the human realms. Particularly in light of such categories as "provided" and "deprived": who, what does the "providing" and "depriving?" Nature? A "referEntial" Nature sug- gests itself as an unconscious backdrop to Girard's thought. A "good" Nature, of course-as animal behavior shows. Only "human nature" seems "bad," at least (which is to say a lot) in part. Man seems "provided" with a capacity for violence but also not "deprived of" the self-regulatory "mechanism" of religion, clearly mani- fest in ritual and sometimes in myth and obscurely in art. As Girard elucidates it, the mechanism seems at once manichean in its structure and jansenistic in its op- eration. The human condition is a manichean battle-ground of reciprocal forces ot evil (the violent/sacred) and good (religion and cultural order). At the same time, Girard pushes the bleak transcendentalism of Pascal and Racine in which God is in- explicably at war with man one step further: the sacred is not only arbitrarily at war with man, it is at war with itself. Man seems to possess an actual (immanent) grace enabling him to till his fields and write his poems, but he is also possessed by violence (like Pascal's corrupted will [la volonte corrompue]) that can break out any moment, sparagmatically converting ploughshares into swords and words into daggers. However, if the tone of Girard's writing is extremist in its Jansenism, his theology is more centrist. For Girard as for Pascal, the sacred that binds man also releases him: It is the mechanism of violence which furnishes the initial impulsion for the discovery of the model and its application now mythic, to the mechanism itself, now non- mythic, to natural phenomena. The first elaboration rises fsurgit] from the founding violence that it brings. It is because it is solicited by the miracle of restored unanim- ity that thought conceives the model, in an observation conjoining the natural and the cultural, and it turns frecourt] then to this same model just about everywhere fun peu partout] without us being yet able, even today, to sort out the arbitrary from the non-arbitrary, nor especially the useful from the useless, the fecund from the insignificant, especially in the domain of psycho-pathology. [p. 401-my emphasis] The sacred is at once sacrilege and sacrament, deprivation of grace and occasion of grace. Girard's discourse here is inevitably marked by a theological vocabulary, for "to speak of the origin of symbolic thought is to speak as well of the origin of language, the veritable fort/da from which rises [surgit] all naming [nomination], the formidable alternation of violence and peace. [. .] For a long time language re- mains impregnated with the sacred and it is not without reason that it appears to be reserved to the sacred and endowed [octroye] by the sacred" [p. 323-my emphasis]. Moreover, as this earlier passage shows in a corrective to the possible anthropomorphism of the later passage-man "discovering" ritual through his own "thought" of the "restored unanimity"-the latter is a miracle that is not self-solicited but is endowed by the sacred. Like Pascal derisively exposing both Jesuit glosses on "sufficient" [suffisante] versus "efficacious" [efficace] grace and Dominican re- visions ("proximate powers" [pouvoir prochain]) of the Jesuit glosses, Girard calls for a "return to origins" that is at once univocal and clear. Not Lacan's "return to Freud." If Girard acknowledges the psychiatrist's wisdom in calling for such a re- turn, it is not to the Freud of the incestuous and parricidal Oedipus, but to the Freud of the neutrally mimetic oedipal desire [pp. 329-30]. It is only there that we can perceive the reciprocity of sacrilege and sacrament and the significance of the nuclear ritual of the pharmakon that is at once a dosage and a cure of sacred violence. Like Lacan in the matter of Freud, so, for Girard, with Derrida in the matter of the linguistic "clue" of the pharmakon: the philosopher-etymologist of "la Phar- macie de Platon" has more to tell us than the philosopher-esthetician of "La Differ- ance." In spite of Derrida, to be sure. Girard does not cite "La Differance" in his new book and this suggests a reluctance on his part to confront the consistent posi- tions of "both" Derridas: that the "differAntial" language of a text [ecriture] is a process, a dynamic of "doing" rather than a stasis of "naming." Where Girard sees the pharmakon as a binary play [jeu] of forces-really a mechanism-yielding a</page><page sequence="7">single product, Derrida, in a closer relation to the etymon, sees it as a pluralized playfulness [jeux], a chain, "the movement, the site, the play (the production of) difference. It is the differance of difference ... a background without background" ["La Pharmacie de Platon," La Dissemination (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1972), p. 146- my translation]. I suspect that Girard's reluctance to confront this crucial relation between differEnce and differAnce even in "La Pharmacie de Platon" is based on his Pascalian intuition-a metaphysical assertion from Derrida's point of view-of the reality of the undifferentiated violence menacing all of man's institutions, including I'ecriture. For Girard, in the beginning was the Flesh and the Flesh is sad, alas . . . I do not intend these Jansenistic perspectives as a "gloss" on Girard's that will make this French critic's work more accessible to "French specialists" in particular. Such parochialism would be unresponsive not only to the substance of his work but also to the scope and ambition of his enterprise here, which is no less than an "explanation" of man. Rather, Girard writes out of the same passionate and com- passionate impulse that informs that saint of Jansenism, Pascal. Like that of The Provincial Letters, Girard's discourse is marked by a blistering irony-the weapon of the underdog according to William Empson ["The Voice of the Underdog," a re- view of Wayne C. Booth. A Rhetoric of Irony (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1974) in New York Review of Books, XXII, No. 10 (June 12, 1975), 37]-because he Writes passionately for those who are "avid for understanding." These are, today, too few among the "scientists of man" and the "docile Uncle Toms" of literary criticism who "prudently" deny that literature has anything to do with reality [p. 418], contenting themselves, as it were, with re-arranging the pieces on the chess- board but never playing out the game to the checkmate of the King (the murdered King, of course). To all such "pre-players" Girard combatively, tenaciously, pascalian- ly says: "but you have to bet. That isn't a voluntary matter: you are launched" [Pascal's Thoughts (Lafuma No. 418, Brunschvicg No. 233)-my translation]. Not that Girard finally falls back onto a Pascalian surrender to the most conservative current of Christian theology. This "solution" characterized Deceit, Desire and the Novel, while, implicitly, at least, La Violence et le sacr6 leads to a sacred presided over by a God Who is neither Hidden nor Revealed. Indeed, through the perspectives of Girard's new book, one may wonder if both Pascal and that other literary saint of Jansenism, Racine, did not perceive something like the God-less sacred that "pre- sides" over man throughout the pages of this book and perhaps the world. Which leads me to the last lacuna that one hopes Girard will fill in the sub- sequent volume on Judeo-Christian applications of his thesis that he promises here. The myth of the scapegoat, the ritual of the murdered king, the tragedy of reciprocal violence-these forms posit a primordial event of violence. But what of anthropo- logical and literary records of a primordial event of peace? To begin with the Bible (to which Girard crucially alludes in the early pages here in summary illustrations of his thesis on the "stories" of Cain and Abel, Abraham and Isaac, Esau and Jacob [pp. 17-19]), before the Fall there was the Garden of Eden. To be sure, Adam first lived there alone; society and potentially pathogenic differentiation did not begin until Eve came to tempt Adam with the forbidden fruit. In terms of Girard's thesis of mimetic desire, she "deviated" her desire for God through the choice of material (sexual) pleasure. (Woman rather than man is thus the agent of cultural differentia- tion. Girard, who loves standing commonplaces on their head, should enjoy dealing with the hoary thesis of the male animal's "rationality" as the polar opposite of the female's "sensuality." But some readers, particularly feminists, will expect some modifications of Girard's male-oriented criticism.) Is this prelapsarian moment, this pre-tragic moment recounted in other myths and religions? The implications for genre theory-and thus for literary theory in general are interesting. In a rare consonance with theorists whom he otherwise finds imperceptive, Girard views comedy as a species or mode of tragedy. Sacred clowns and sacred buffoons, the North-American Indian trickster, royal fools, Kings of Fools-such fig- ures regularly sacrificed at the end of their brief reign "incarnate . . . the mechanism of sacred violence, in the same way as the African King but in a different mode. We must link all this to collective violence, of course, and more specifically to a certain mode of this violence. Alongside serious expulsion, there must have always existed an expulsion founded in part at least on the ridiculous" [p. 351-my emphasis]. The "alongside" and the "in part at least" may be a logical escape hatch too broad to encompass all comedy as a mode of tragedy and sacred violence. Of course, Girard may find warrant for his position in Socrates' remarks on comedy and tragedy at the end of The Symposium. Many readers of the English translation will be familiar with the third edition of the Jowett translation which reads that "the genius of comedy was the same with that of tragedy, and that the true artist in tragedy was an artist in comedy also" [The Works of Plato, ed. Irwin Edman. (New York: Modern Library, 1928), p. 393]. However, the Jowett translation revised by Moses Hadas renders the passage: "the same man might be expert in the writing of both com- diccritics /Summer 1976 47</page><page sequence="8">, For further reflections on the ge- neric polarity, tragedy/comedy, that I posit here, see my "Tragedy and the Tragic," Arion: A Quarterly Journal of Classical Culture, II No. 4 (Winter 1963), 86-95 and my "Moliere: The Metaphysic of Comedy," L'Esprit Criateur, XV, Nos. 1-2 (Spring-Sum- mer 1975), 119-29. edy and tragedy: if it was by craftmanship that a man composed a tragedy, he could compose a comedy in the same way" [Plato: Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, and Symposium. (Chicago: A Gateway Edition, Henry Regnery Co., 1953), p. 142]. In the first translation, a tendency towards metaphysical unity; in the sec- ond, a tendency toward technical distinction. In both instances, the text is at best enigmatic. If we accept the metaphysical tendency, we must wonder which "mode" assimilates the other. If we accept the technical tendency, we do not necessarily exclude a metaphysical consonance-although even including it we must still ask which "mode" assimilates the other. The status of comedy is, then, pretty much up in the air. Girard's own escape hatch of "in part at least" allows for a theory in which comedy is not a mode or a camouflaged and tenuous instance of the tragic, but an independent genre on an ontological par with if not ontologically prior to tragedy. "Prior" perhaps by the very terms of Girard's core notion of reciprocal vi- olence. Before the King was (or, in Girardian perspective: is) murdered, he lived (lives). A sacred state of peace exists before a sacred state of violence; unanimity has to exist before it is destroyed and then restored. (Unanimity and differentiation: in dividing His labor over the first six days of creation, God is the First Structuralist). Or, to retain Girard's model, must we regress to the birth trauma? Yet, here, the first birth, at least in Judeo-Christian "history," is painless: of Eve out of Adam's rib. But, then, Adam was asleep, presumably anesthetized by God, so perhaps there is or would have been pain "at the beginning" of sexual society (Adam and Eve) if not of "social" society (Adam and God). However, what of other "histories"-those suggesting, for example, that the first divinities were goddesses? Without necessarily falling into animism (Ceres, etc.), does this model suggest that the sacred was initially peaceful and, however fructifying, non-violent? In certain versions of the thesis, violence came with the overthrow of the female divinities by men who then erected their own sex into the divinity. Is the nuclear oedipal complex a violent resentment not against the father but against the mother? Presumably for the pain of birth to the child (and her own, of course, in the process)? But, then, what of the peace and comfort of the womb that preceded this? And, prior to this, of the pleasure of the act of procreation? Or must we see in the energy of sexual union an assault, a violence? But, then, might we not be subscribing to a jansenistic sexophobia? Even returning to Girard's tragicentric focus, does not his own thesis of the initially non-pathogenic mimetic desire of the oedipal situation posit the grounding reciprocity as a sequence of peace or, at least, non-violent neutrality followed by violence? Is this not the sense of Girard's model in the postlapsarian terms of his book? And, applying his thematics to the prelapsarian motifs I have cited (and others), might one not derive a different, a "comedic" system of "r6ferAnce"? To suggest that Aristophanes and Rabelais and Moliere provided this system is not to undermine the value of Girard's thematics. It is to suggest that the heuristic exhaustion of the origins of tragedy he offers in this seminal book is not exhaustive of interpretation-of literature or man.3 48</page></plain_text>
