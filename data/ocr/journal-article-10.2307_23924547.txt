<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Literature &amp; Theology, Vol. 7, No. 3, September 1993 'WHENCE COMES THIS LOVE AS STRONG AS DEATH?': THE PRESENCE OF FRANZ ROSENZWEIG'S 'PHILOSOPHY AS NARRATIVE' IN HANS URS VON BALTHASAR'S THEO-DRAMA Francesca Murphy Writing to Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, Franz Rosenzweig asked him to expand on his notion of'Nature and Revelation'.1 His Protestant friend's reply fertilised the 'germ cell' of Rosenzweig's The Star of Redemption.2 This book imagines the bond of being as a dialogue between God and 'Adam'. Rosenzweig's 'philosophy as narrative'3 is one 'germ' of von Balthasar's Theo-Drama. These notes about his presence in the Theo-Drama are intended to indicate the paths which Rosenzweig's reading of the Bible exposes for Christians. I. FRANZ ROSENZWEIG Born in Cassel in 1889, Rosenzweig, Gershom Scholem tells us, 'grew up...without Judaism and without Torah.'4 His doctoral research of 1910—1912 was published in 1920 as Hegel and the State. In 1914, rooting among Hegel's papers, he uncovered 'The Oldest Program Towards a System in German Idealism'. Although in Hegel's handwriting, it was, he contended, Schelling's work.5 1913 was the year in which he turned back to the Bible. On a July night, he and Rosenstock-Huessy did battle over the question: revelation or relativism? Rosenzweig yielded his positivist convictions. His consequent decision to reappropriate his Jewishness on the way to Christianity led, during the Yom Kippur service, to his return to Judaism. During 1916, the two locked arms again, this time by post: by now, both were at the front. Their letters are marked by truthfulness, each man exposing his commitment, as Jew and as Christian, and equally by openness to truth. Rosenstock-Huessy proposed that, in the absence of revelation, we live in an undifferentiated space and time. Revelation breaks up that uni Oxford University Press 1993</page><page sequence="2">228 'LOVE AS STRONG AS DEATH' formity. It nails the subject into a spatial and temporal setting not organised by human rationality. After 'God speaks to us with the "word become flesh".space and time are no longer philosophical concepts, but 'a standard outside itself in the visible footsteps of God.'6 The effect of revelation is emplacement. The human mind has an above and below because it is not primary: it is located, from beyond itself, by a partner who is both other and transcendent. Rosenzweig replied that, although the religious person alities of Jew and Christian stand opposed, their 'final root in the soul' is shared. For each is bound to '...the common objective origin of revelation. ...Only for Jews and Christians exists that firm orientation of the world in space and time; the actual world and actual history.'7 The notorious myths which the Bible has engendered, setting men and women on the earth, below a God and a heaven who are up above, and in which Genesis is behind and final redemption yet to come, reflect the situating effect of revelation, as the human partner takes its stand over against the divine speaker. II. THE STAR OF REDEMPTION Rosenzweig's letters home of 1918 were of a new order. They blocked out The Star of Redemption. The book was published in 1921. It is a strange and prickly work. It sometimes takes the form of concrete poetry, drawing its typography into its exposition: its section headings are built into inverted triangles. The Star goes forth to slay the Idealist dragon. The 'All' which 'does not die' is opposed to the unique being, who 'will not be tapped into bottles': 'man'.8 To Kant's elusive triad of transcendental ideas, God, world and soul, it adds creation, revelation and redemption: the conjunction of the two triangles forms the 'Star' of the title. The most obvious predecessor is Kierkegaard. But The Star is more particular. Scholem says of it, 'the entire Jewish world is as if folded into this book...'9 To rephrase E.P. Sanders on Bultmann's (mis)reading of Paul, it is not about the plight of humanity, but about God's revelation in the Jewish scriptures. Robert Alter notes that, for Jews of this period, such as Scholem, rejection of assimilation entailed the recapture of a language. Hebrew represents a 'geospiritual orientation'. Those who use the Semitic languages, which are written from right to left, inhabit a different life-world from that constituted by the Latin, left to right, script.10 a) Aesthetics Drama finds its foothold in Greece, birthplace, for Rosenzweig, of the 'beautiful configuration'. Beauty has for him, as for Schelling, a special</page><page sequence="3">FRANCESCA MURPHY 229 relation to myth. The shaping idea of a work of art is externally visible. Beauty is 'outer form' (this provided by myth), 'inner form' and 'content'.11 Picturing 'Hellas' through the lense of aesthetic Idealism, Rosenzweig claims that Greek myth made its way 'from man to God'; God does not go forth to it. Yet beauty is 'the miracle of outer form'. The perfect rapport with beautiful form for which Greece stands will not be recreated by human civilisation alone: Only in the Kingdom would the world be configuration as visible as it had been in the plastic world of paganism, the cosmos. (The Star. p. 219) Greek drama presents a world of outwardness. But its heroes are silent. They have not yet found, or been given, speech. Played on by reality, addressed by the chorus which represents it, the tragic hero says nothing. We are told that, This had to be presented on stage: ...The hero is supposed to be a visible figure... For all his muteness, the mute hero stood in the world. That any kind of world was...possible in paganism...was because he stood in it... For ...he was not simply impervious to its effects: the cloak of invisibility and Gyges' ring are ...disastrous...because they sunder every contact with the world, (p. 207) Though wordless, the tragic hero is no solipsist. Greece makes contact with being in the visible form of the beautiful. Language, or revelation is ahead of it. The one biblical figure with whom Rosenzweig compares the tragic hero is Job. b) Language, or Philosophy as Narrative Somewhat as Coleridge imbued reason and imagination with a theological connotation lacking in Kant's epistemological machine, Rosenzweig draws from the phenomenological conception of language as intentional repres entation the beginnings of a theory of creation, revelation and redemption. Behind language, and founding it, lie the 'Arch-words'. These are the soundless principles of being. They are accompanied by 'root-words', the patterns of living speech as it is received and returned by speakers. The Star is in the manner of rhetoric rather than dialectic. But what it has of language mysticism has also the stamp of careful observation. Root-words compose the forms of grammar. For Rosenzweig, the sentence is 'fixed to a single point in space' by the definite article and noun, and bound to a finite time by the verb. In the technical analysis of word meaning supplied by Husserl's student, Roman Ingarden, the noun points to a 'static' and 'completed' thing, the finished product, whereas the verb intends a non-substantial</page><page sequence="4">230 'LOVE AS STRONG AS DEATH' 'unfolding in pure happening'. The basic linguistic operation, Ingarden notes, is not the use of isolated words, but their functional combination in the finite sentence. It is only the 'empty formal schema' of the sentence structure which is actualised in the interrelation of nouns and verbs.12 As Rosenzweig puts it, the sentence structure, or 'logical form' is the pre ordained, the 'given'; the 'particular' word is the novelty, the 'gift'.13 The sentence structure is an abstraction, awaiting concrete contextualization: In the universal there reposed a need for fulfilment, an implication of applica tion; nothing of the sort reposes in the distinctive. (The Star. pp. 45-6) Sentence structures belong to the 'mute' grammar of Reason; tactile words create the realm of dialogue: For the word is mere inception until it finds reception in an ear, and response in a mouth, (p. 110) The arch-word which shelters creation is God's 'Yea'. His creating is an affirmation. The root-word of creation is not a noun, a thingly 'Thus', but an adjective: it is a value-judgement, which designates the 'How'. The verb which sets creation into time places it in the past: ...only after the work has been done can the craftsman say 'Good!' ... (p. 131) As a thing done, creation concludes in the 'objectivizing narrative form of the past tense'. God creates through the word 'Good': the same word 'reverberates' in human speaking, (p. 151) The tense of revelation is always 'present'. Its action wakens language to life. Its intention follows the narrow passage from an T to a 'Thou'. Its 'first audible word..., its root-word, is 'I'. (p. 173) In Rosenzweig's 'Grammatical Analysis of Genesis I', God's creating is first that of a neutral 'It': it is as a Thou that He says 'let us make man'. In the personal naming of 'Adam' His making-speech finally touches a particular 'I'—who is yet to speak. When God addresses Adam, creation is pierced by the miracle of revelation. The human 'reverberation' of the word answers the question which revelation puts. And when, in corporate response to God, the community not only speaks, but sings His praise, we have the inception of redemption: that 'God is good' is ...the root-sentence of redemption, the roof over the house of language. (P- 231) All prayer is for the coming of the Kingdom. The summons of the eternal</page><page sequence="5">FRANCESCA MURPHY 231 Thou to the human person particularises this one being. It thereby enables one to perceive the other person as a 'Thou'. It draws 'Thou-ness' into the human realm: 'Where once the dual has applied, where someone or something has become neighbour to the soul, there a piece of the world has become something which it was not previously: soul.' (p. 235) This, too, is an anticipation of the Kingdom. c) Metaphysics, 'Divine Nature' Although it is his own, 'Divine Nature' is not a phrase which comes spontaneously to Rosenzweig. Moses Mendelsshohn had called God 'the Eternal': Rosenzweig thought that this is to distance that which is close at hand.14 He nonetheless gives us two divine attributes: God's 'Yea', the originary word, which constitutes His 'infinite essence', and God's 'Nay', which springs from His absolute freedom.15 Without that freedom, God might be 'automatically' in or alongside the human realm; but He could not be personally related to it: ...to this end it would be necessary for the infinite God to come more finitely close to man, more face to face with him, more proper-name to proper-name than any...wisdom of wise men could ever admit, (p. 39) Rosenzweig's God is characterised, not in terms of a general, universal language, but by the specific words of Scripture. God as word, or better, as Name is the absolute particular, the Thou. Alter distinguishes the Hebrew mind, which fastens to a text from the Hellenic mind, which delves into reality. The Jewish attitude, he says, is summed up in Ben Bag-Bag's saying about the Bible: 'Turn it over, and turn it over again, for everything is in it'. Rosenzweig also cites this.16 The contrast should be applied to The Star only with caution. The first section is about God: it commences, as it were, before Genesis. It is the second section, Creation, which might tempt us to say that God becomes real for Rosenzweig as He peeps within the horizon of the Biblical text. Here he says, 'God spoke. That came second. It is not the beginning. It is already the audible fulfilment of the silent beginning. It is already the first miracle. The beginning is: God created.' (p. 112) Nor does he imply that God must create, as an implication of His nature: this God is free. Rather, we would say that Rosenzweig's theological imagining is bounded by the field of the Bible. He claims that we cannot</page><page sequence="6">232 'LOVE AS STRONG AS DEATH' picture what God was like before creation; but we can imagine how He will be after redemption, after He has been embodied by the biblical story. (P- 383) If, as Rosenzweig claims, 'Antiquity arrived at monism, but no more', that is because it lacked the miracle of revelation. And if, as he argues, miracle is the skeleton in the cupboard of post-Enlightenment theology, that is because it fled the authoritative standard. It escaped the 'terra firma' of 'truth', fleeing into the arms of philosophy. The Star's three strands of argument, its challenge to Idealism, its personalist theology, and the linked attention to language, come to a head in the defence of miracle. The philosophical act is directed to the universal. There is no abstract, general act of dying. The act which does touch the 'I' is that of love. Love gives of itself to, or communes with, this person. It can enter the solitary and incommunicable space of death. Rosenzweig's 'Grammatical Analysis of the Song of Songs' upturns the predominance of the word 'I'. Here is spoken that which is 'as strong as death'.17 The miracle of divine love thus revealed, ...is not an attribute but an event. ...Revelation knows of no 'all-loving' Father; God's love is ever wholly of the moment and to the point at which it is directed. ... This love is the eternal victory over death. ...He draws too nigh to us in love for us to be able to say: he is this or that. In this love we learn only that he is God, not what he is. ...summoned thus by name, we move in the orbit in which we found ourselves, and along the route on which we are placed, (pp. 164 and 381) d) Collaboration with Martin Buber Rosenzweig wrote two 'war-books'. The second, like The Star composed on army postcards, is a plan for an Institute of Jewish Higher Education.18 In 1920, he moved to Frankfurt, there to realise his design in the Freies Jüdisches Lehrhaus. Within two years, he had begun to endure the nervous paralysis which deprived him of speech. From his sick bed, and with Buber's collaboration, Rosenzweig translated the Bible into German. It may be here that we find the particular application—and origin?—of The Star's 'root words'. He and Buber found in the Bible a web of recurrent 'leitworter'. The leitwort is a word-root threaded through the Biblical text. It both signals the presence of a single meaning, and sends 'waves moving back and forth between the words.'19 Rosenzweig had completed work on Isaiah when he died, in 1929. Rosenzweig drew Buber into the Lehrhaus' ambience. He told Buber that ...he had been reading Job 'as a Biblical illustration of I and Thou.'...20</page><page sequence="7">FRANCESCA MURPHY 233 I and Thou is the substance of Buber's first lecture course at the Lehrhaus, of 1923. The book is more familiar than the Star, perhaps more digestible. Its truth is immediately recognisable: the experience of two 'primary words', 'I-Thou', and 'I-It'. But read it after The Star of Redemption, and you may sense a making general of the insight. We are, to some extent, back in the world of German philosophy. Buber's 'I—It' ...sets things in space and time, in causal connexion, each with its... appointed course, its measurability and conditioned nature.21 Kant's demarcation of spatio-temporal relations from the noumenal sphere of morality are given their genuine location by Buber's contrast of manip ulative 'I-It' and unpredictable 'I-Thou'. And yet, the dynamism seems to be a 'no' to utilitarian classification, not creation, revelation, redemption. In Buber's world, 'relation', or dialogue have always been there. He states, In the beginning is the relation—as category of being..., mould for the soul; it is the a priori of relation, the inborn Thou.22 Dialogue is built into personality. The divine Thou upholds, but does not inaugurate it. There is no absolute 'In the beginning'. e) The Aesthetic Again, and Truth Speech does not have the last word. Rosenzweig's work was phenomenolo gical: it uncovers the significance of human representation. Acts of thought, such as promising, law-making and speaking represent meaning: the con crete poetry of bodily acts does so more tangibly. The impetus of Rosenzweig's interest tends toward the 'gesture' which, he says, is 'beyond word and deed.'23 Liturgical praise is best expressed by dance; it is found among Jews—the Hasidim—but not among Christians: Dance is that form of art in which poetry...emerges...transposing itself from the ideal world of conception into the real world of exposition... A people recognizes itself in festive processions and parades... Dance... finds its place in the religious service only among us... (pp. 372-3) In his Sacred and Profane Beauty, the Lutheran phenomenologist of religion, Gerardus van der Leeuw claims that dance is lived meaning; in it, body and spirit commune both with each other and with the world. It is the foundational religious act. Dance is is the rhythmic mimesis, or representa tion, of a theological reminiscence: that 'God is love, that is, movement.'24 Rosenzweig first knew God's presence in the liturgy of the Day of Atonement. To affirm that the 'divine nature' consists in 'truth' is, he says,</page><page sequence="8">234 'LOVE AS STRONG AS DEATH' a statement of 'trust'. It is a decision to root the personal 'experience of truth', not in One Who is simply the given 'essential attribute' of truth, but in a mobile being who makes Himself known in His approach to this particular person. That God '...is truth tells us none other than that he loves.'25 III. HANS URS VON BALTHASAR At first glance, von Balthasar's oeuvre seems comically dissimilar from Rosenzweig's. The first impression is of highly wrought Gothic weight: seven volumes of The Glory of the Lord: A Theological Aesthetics, given to God's self-expression as beauty, buttressed by the Theo-Drama, in which the good is known in the engagement of Infinite and finite freedom. The vault is the Theo-Logic, which grapples with Truth. Beauty is to be contem plated. Theology conceives it as 'theo-phany'. The good is that which is done-, its theological counterpart is 'theo-praxy'.26 In the ninth century, Amalarius of Metz taught mediaeval Christendom how to interpret scrip ture: by performing it, in the Mass. This gave rise to the first liturgical drama, the Quem Quaeritis play. Herein, on Easter Sunday, four deacons re-enact the discovery of the empty tomb (Mark 16.6): the peripeteia is the resurrection thus made manifest; the anagnorisis is the recognition of the risen Christ in the consecrated Host.27 The Theo-Drama is in one sense a Quern Quaeritis play in five volumes. Beauty, goodness and truth undergird all being. Though conceptually distinct, they are ontologically implicit in one another.28 The good strides onto the world stage in the concluding two volumes of The Glory, which depict the 'Old' and the 'New' covenants. The Pentateuch's stories of David and Saul turn on the dilemma of moral freedom. The Old Covenant knows the good with lucidity. Here, von Balthasar says, ... the truth...of God is...the ...reliability of his person, ...made known to Israel in the grace of his...covenant.29 Truth and beauty are perceived as 'modalities' of the good; that is, defined in relation to it. This is not, with Robertson Smith, to characterise Israel by that ethical superiority which, at least for the prophets, led to a splendid detachment from the vacuous exteriority of cultic religion.30 For von Balthasar, Israel's true 'originality' lies in the fact that it is able to transform everything into praise ...Israel is happy when it sings. By giving back his glory to God, it fulfils itself as God's image, and also understands why it is not permitted to</page><page sequence="9">FRANCESCA MURPHY 235 make for itself any carved image of God. ... Only so is the space made ready in which God's Word can become flesh.31 The Theo-Drama interprets the events of salvation with reference to the theatre. The playwright's script is a finite verbal structure; but it must be left sufficiently open for the actors to make play with it, to interpret it. The theatrical 'dromenon', or thing done, is held up to view. A play is performed 'between' two sets of onlookers: before the actors sit the audience; behind them, in the Greek theatre, stood the gods. The actors put a narrative meaning into action. The playwright gives the script 'potential' meaning: the actor must 'make things present...'. Acting is the gesture of mediation. It communicates an 'ideality' from the author's scripted meaning intention to the 'reality' of the audience. The actor moves between ideality and reality, the gods and the audience. The audience is not a detached witness; it must collaborate with, and accept, the performance. The successful play is a public 'communion'.32 The ideality which the actor transmits is not a generality: characters such as Iphigenia or Alcestis are not philosophical 'types' but unique personalit ies.33 Each character is built up successively, as she travels through the sequence of the narrative, toward the good. Seen in relation to 'the good', theology is about character, or moral identity. As characters in this story, both God and human beings only manifest their identity within the course of the play. The dramatic analogue entails the avoidance of theological essentialism.34 The inception is once more, 'In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.' Heaven and earth are not a given backdrop and stage: they participate in the personalised event-structure of the performance. The 'two poles' of heaven and earth, of God and human partner meet in historical dialogue. It will issue in Christ's proclamation of the Kingdom of heaven on earth and the elevation of His earthed human space into heaven.35 Von Balthasar's idea of the relation between Judaism and Christianity reflects the Paul of Romans 8—11. He underlines Paul's assurance that 'all Israel shall be saved' (Romans 11.26).36 E.P. Sanders marks Paul's point of departure from his kinsmen in his 'participationist eschatology.'37 Von Balthasar has absorbed Paul's apocalyptic vision of Christian incorporation 'en Christo'. Van der Leeuw distinguishes dance from drama, as movement from 'movement and countermovement'. Drama adds the moment of colli sion-, and, in the confrontation of opposed forces, the turn, or peripeteia.38 Dramatic characters meet and rebound. In von Balthasar's 'theo-drama', history is a dialogue between God and the world. It is also a battle between opposing powers. His reading of Genesis' 'Let us create' is interestingly different from Rosenzweig's:</page><page sequence="10">236 'LOVE AS STRONG AS DEATH' ...in the 'we' of...creation...God is addressing his heavenly court. ...in the Book of Revelation, the 'Word of God' rides forth to the final battle on a white horse, we read (Rev. 19.14) that 'the armies of heaven ... followed him on white horses'. Heaven and earth are thus in theodramatic relationship ...and these 'armies' of God... are figures endowed with a mission.39 In the Christian life, the dramatic role is the mission. IV. LYRIC, EPIC, DRAMA We need not overload the divergence between Rosenzweig's 'dialogue' and von Balthasar's 'battle': drama is the central symbol for each. Hegel beque athed to them a triad of genres: lyric, epic and drama. Each is a way of representing reality. In lyrical compositions, the lines of force lead to a subject. The lyrical world belongs to the subject who experiences it. The epical world is viewed from without; an invisible controlling hand moves the camera from scene to scene, wielding all into a whole. Rosenzweig relates the two to time and to space: ...Space, the 'epically' extensive breadth, is the world of external observation; time, the 'lyrically' intensive depth, is that of inner observation.40 He says that drama is the higher genre because it combines 'epic fullness' and 'lyric immediacy', and holds them together. The strength of lyric is its ability to exalt a tiny fragment of reality. The great epic conveys a whole world; but at the possible cost of losing the single 'I'. Von Balthasar suggests lyric and epic modes of theology. Theological 'lyric' is found in Augustine's confessional journey, through the self to God. The omnivorous mediaeval Sumrnas reflect epical objectivism. Lyric and epic are also positions of a speaker, in relation to an audience. Lyric theology is delivered to a believing community. Epic speaks to the world without. Its God is likewise detached. Von Balthasar claims, In lyrical theology God and Christ are addressed as 'Thou'; in epic theology they are referred to as 'He'.41 The choice as to where to locate the narrator depends on a view of where the object to be portrayed stands. The lyrical God is caught up in a dialogue with the speaker, which the reader overhears; for epic, God is outside the action, as is the speaker. Both tend toward monologue. In lyric, the object can dissolve into the subject's enraptured self-expression. The epical ideal is detached description, which needs no observer for completion. Only in drama are two speakers intrinsic to the generic structure. It is not self-evident that Macbeth has an inherent aesthetic superiority to</page><page sequence="11">FRANCESCA MURPHY 237 War and Peace. That lyric is incomplete because it presupposes the greater cosmos in which its fragment rests, or that a narrator's externality to a work is a deficiency, are theological criteria, and that theology as conceived ethically. It is not, for that, a non-literary criterion. Alter argues that, because its narratives are put across in dialogue rather than description, the Hebrew Bible better represents human freedom and its moral conflict than the closed ancient epic.42 For von Balthasar, drama knows no absolute demarcation between audi ence and players. Theatre is enthralling because it projects the human condition of the audience: one knows oneself in the play. Its plot guides the gathered subjectivities of the audience. It poses a question: the onlookers who accept the play's 'solution' are 'struck' by it. As he notes, Aristotle designated the response as 'phobos' and 'eleos'.43 Unless one takes the action into oneself, one knows no more than the sequence of events. There is 'no external standpoint' from which the audience can understand the play. Some of those in search of their genre have suggested that the Gospels are narrated from an omniscient, third-party perspective. The authors are compared to directors pointing a movie camera; unlike Hitchcock, they never appear on stage.44 But, as von Balthasar says, the Evangelists earned their right seeing in engagement. Although invisible as characters in the story, they know the action which they recreate from within. They did not report on the action from outside it. Like a fairy-tale, John Drury says, Mark's gospel was written to be read outloud. As a 'sermon', Ernst Best contends, more sternly, it has open-spaces, making way both for participa tion by the 'communing' audience and for Christ to speak 'of' himself in His gospel. David Ford suggests, likewise, that Paul's letter-genre refers both to the writer and to his audience: it thereby reflects the threefold 'relationality' between God, Paul and Christian community.45 Von Balthasar claims that this meeting of divine object, speaker, and audience issues from the unification of lyric subjectivity and epic objectivity in drama. He writes, The two coincide...when Paul writes a letter and, in it, testifies with his whole life to the truth of revelation, putting God's action in the centre, but including himself...he shows how the drama comes from God, via Christ, to him, and how he hands it on to the community, which is already involved in the action and must bring it to reality.46 There is no detached position for the Biblical narrators. Theology seen in relation to the good depends upon knowing what to do next, how to place oneself in relation to what is going forward. The detached spectator loses her place, the context, because she is not moving with the action. The</page><page sequence="12">238 'LOVE AS STRONG AS DEATH' ultimate reason why distanced narration has no place in the theo-drama is that its object, God, is moving with the play: ...in God's plan for the world, the possibilities are not...static like places on a map...: the paths themselves journey and wander as, leading on those who walk along them. ...In Romans 8.28-30... Providence circles around and accompanies man in this process of assimilation to the Son.47 V. EPPUR SI MUOVE 'Alas', as Gershom Scholem says, ...according to Rosenzweig, Islam knows of no interrelationship between ...God, man and the world...48 'Interrelationship' signifies that the 'poles' be really there and that they affect one another. Rosenzweig believed that Islam cannot give equal reality to God and to human beings. It lacks what he called the 'other pole' of revelation: the human 'I'. He adversely contrasts the Koran's immobility to the drama found in Judaism and in Christianity. In both, oral tradition has a primacy over 'writing it down'. But in Islam... the book is sent down from heaven. Can there be a more thorough renunciation of the concept that God himself'descends', himself gives himself, surrenders himself to man? He sits enthroned in his heaven of heavens and presents to man—a book.49 To take the Bible as one's model of reality is not to be governed by a fixed order of sentences: Its 'Word' cannot be nailed to one place, and worshipped. It travels between two poles. Revelation moves: it requires reciprocity and interpretation, the human handing on. Von Balthasar, also, states that Muslims worship a 'motionless' God. Outside the Bible, religion is 'epical'.50 Both men defend ontological pluralism as against monism, and also, through the model of Biblical drama, the mutual conditioning and exchange through which the human 'substance' is made. In drama, the characters' search for its particular good is conditioned by conflicting forces. Von Balthasar claims that Christianity is not (like the Koran...) a 'teaching' that has fallen from heaven, but an interaction, a kind of negotiation between two parties... For... the one dialogue partner is affected 'through and through' [dia-logos] by the standpoint of the other partner, (p. 71) Such comments are less interesting for what they tell us about Islam than</page><page sequence="13">FRANCESCA MURPHY 239 for their perception of what the God of the Bible is like. Rosenzweig's conception of God is, not cosmologically, but Biblically, anthropomorphic. He hesitates before definitions of God. He prefers to picture God in action: that is what the Bible shows. Von Balthasar was more willing to provide the metaphysical statement of what God is. For him, the 'eheyeh asher eheyeh' of Exodus 3.14 is as much a description of God's nature, in its constant 'presence' and 'actuality', as of his trustworthiness, (p. 278) The cognitive transition which is here made locates the Biblical image in an ontology, which, when it is at home, means in an 'is'. But, the more one dislocates one's statement from the Bible's dialogical frame, the more rigid does He appear. The Deists' Clockmaker is not the 'essence' of the Biblical God. With the help of the work of those such as Buber and Rosenzweig, von Balthasar imagines God's freedom. It led him to see the ability and the fact of movement. He said that, .. .the God of the old covenant possesses a remarkable inner mobility, based.. .in his inconceivable inner freedom. ...his 'glory' wanders with his people through the wilderness... in paradise, he was a God who came and went (Gen. 3.8), and later he was a descending God (Gen. 11.5, 7) ...To this outer mobility there corresponds an inner mobility. ...he... personally commits himself at specific moments of history. He makes decisions, but he can also 'repent' (Gen. 6.6; i Sam. 15.11; Amos 7.3, 6).51 That God can descend is, for von Balthasar, the presupposition of the enfleshment of the Word. VI. IDEALISM Rosenzweig learned a great deal from Idealism: The Star's image of the freedom of God is the negative impression of the Idealists' subsumption of divine freedom within human self-constitution. For the Idealists, Rosenzweig says, there is no free creation, but, rather 'emanation' and 'generation': the generator is the human spirit. Without the break, the miracle, the absolute point of origin of free creation, 'philosophy' must 'recognize "Being" as...a circle...'.52 Von Balthasar registers his own dis avowal of the Idealist synthesis at great and leisurely lengths. He notes that, in Schelling's version of the 'theo-drama', the 'divine author' is brought into being through the process of the human actors' performing. This is deemed necessary to preserve human freedom. He comments, This is the secularized form of the old theologoumenon of the wheel of history which, in its circling, once more comes round to paradise; it is the theme of perfect identity between freedom and nature (necessity).53</page><page sequence="14">240 'LOVE AS STRONG AS DEATH' Lest the definition of 'German Idealism' seems somewhat loose, let it define itself, in the 'Oldest Program Towards a System in German Idealism' (1796), discovered by Rosenzweig: An ethics. Inasmuch as the whole of metaphysics will in future be subsumed under moral philosophy—a matter in which Kant, with his two practical postulates, has merely provided an example...—this ethics will be... a complete system... The first idea is of course the representation of me myself as an absolutely free creature. At the same time, along with the free, self-conscious creature, a whole world comes to the fore—out of nothing—the sole true and conceivable creation out of nothing. ... At the close, the idea that unifies all, the idea of beauty, the word taken in its higher, Platonic sense. For I am convinced that the supreme act of reason, because it embraces all ideas, is an aesthetic act; and that only in beauty are truth and goodness of the same flesh. ... Poesy will thereby attain a higher dignity ...the poetic art alone will survive all the other sciences and arts. ...54 Rosenzweig's attribution of this text to Schelling has been contested. Other claimants include Hölderlin and Hegel; David Krell wickedly proposes Nietzsche.55 Von Balthasar concurs with Rosenzweig's intuition. He claims that, in his elevation of beauty above truth and the good, and his conception of knowledge as an aesthetic 'making' which constitutes its object, Schelling wrote the arch-words of Idealism.56 Rosenzweig would add only that Idealism replaces language with logic. He says that it '...sought a human Eden... It had to be a garden planted by man himself, yet not consciously so. ...Thus...Idealism, at the moment when it rejected lan guage, apotheosized art.'57 His 'method of speech' will not allow a 'transcendental ego' to unfurl the real from its own ethical positings.58 We have traced something of what representation meant for Rosenzweig and for von Balthasar. The first issue which is at stake between them and the Idealists is whether this is actually re-presentation; a response to, or 'reverberation' with a given fact or word. Representation is the 'passage through', the 'dia' of dialogue: if we cancel the 'of-ness' of representation, there is no space left for the intentional 'between'. Von Balthasar lays stress on the issue of the representation of beauty. This, he says, rests on a decision: ...whether aesthetics... is first and foremost a theory of perceptions that under stands particular beings as expressions ...of the self-revealing Ground of Being, going on to develop a doctrine of man who expresses himself by imitating the</page><page sequence="15">FRANCESCA MURPHY 241 divine creative activity; or whether (as in modern aesthetic theories) aesthetics can be transformed into a primary doctrine of man's self-expression...59 Does the absence of being take priority over its presence? It will do so in our Biblical interpretation if, for example, we fortify Mark's beauteous midrash against the incursion of questions about correspondence to facts. Some have thought to win the battle against historical-criticism at the cost of the very Romantic insistence that Source Criticism begins and ends in the Imagination of the Evangelists. This is to import into Biblical criticism the conviction of Schelling (or Hegel, Hölderlin, Nietzsche...) that '...the supreme act of reason... is an aesthetic act; and that only in beauty are truth and goodness of the same flesh.' It is also to freeze Scripture into that immobility which Rosenzweig and von Balthasar, perhaps unjustly, ascribed to the Koran. The beautiful by itself is a perfect globe to be contemplated. Those who wish that theology engage in praxis before embarking upon theory may have occasion to wonder whether their praxis fits the human world in which they would thus act. Sealed into aesthetic ideality, the Bible neither demands ethical decision, nor asks us to imagine that our engagement will touch the ground of the truth of another person. VII. THE CALL a) The Star of Redemption As the Idealists noticed, the individual subject does not invent itself. It sets out from within a long-playing narrative which gives it a part to play. For Rosenzweig, this is the earliest state of human life. He calls it 'personality'. He says, '...personality is man playing the role assigned to him by fate, one role among many in the polyphonic symphony of mankind.' (p. 68) The word comes from the Latin 'persona': personality is the social mask. The function assigned is always general, corresponding to the general needs of society for carpet-fitters, doctors, optimists. It was left to the Idealists to ...reconstuct...the world as a grand staircase of personality, (p. 143) 'Character' is next to emerge. On 'the birthday of the self, the person discovers two things: that is free and that it is an individual. Now its mortality becomes a trial to it. It is pursued by Eros and, with greater threat, by Thanatos. Rosenzweig portrays 'character' as possessed by the inward directed aggression which Freud ascribed to the death instinct. As 'character', the self is an absolute ego, choosing its own path. 'Character', propelled by will, is not receptive to plurality: it is a 'fixed' and single</page><page sequence="16">242 'LOVE AS STRONG AS DEATH' 'direction'. Defined in virtue of its free will, 'hubristic', walled up in its solitude, the 'introverted self' will neither speak nor listen, (pp. 167, 213). We have met this figure already: he is the hero of tragic drama. As the product of art, the hero has 'outer form', in the mythic story he inhabits, and 'inner form' in his 'plastic' (sculptural?) 'self-containedness'. 'Content' sets him in the public gaze. Since he is wrapped in the silence of his own will, he has nothing in common with his audience, nothing to transmit to them, except his self: The self is what is condemned to silence in man and yet is everywhere and at once understood. It need only be rendered visible, 'acted out', in order to awaken the self in every other one as well. ...whoever sees it awakens, as it was...formulated with profound insight by Aristotle, to 'terror and compas sion'. These awaken in the spectator ...making a self out of him. (pp. 80-1) This is the furthest extent of the self outside the divine dialogue. There follows what only God can bring about: the transition from the mystery into the miracle God calls: He asks 'Where art Thou?' Adam hides. Why does Rosenzweig emphasise this? Perhaps because it affixes the naming to the scene after Adam's first sin; and perhaps because he is also thinking of Job, who detests having to be tried on stage between the 'eyes' of God and Satan and those of men: Job cries for the invisibility of the grave (Job, 7.8; 10.18; 13.20—22; 14.i—3, 13). But, once 'called by his name', the person is touched as soul. The 'souV cannot escape: it replies 'Here I am', (pp. 175—6). The soul knows that the presence of God's naming precedes and envelopes its own language: God... reaches back into the past and identifies himself as the one who... origin ated this dialogue...: 'I have called thee by name: thou art mine (Isa. 43.1). ...belief...comes to rest in this certainty of having been long ago summoned, by name, to belief. ...Now it knows: it need but stretch out its right hand in order to feel God's right hand coming to meet it. (pp. 183-4) b) Theo-Drama Von Balthasar begins by thinking about the human self as enacting its social role. In its Stoic form, this conception touches on the limitations which bind the subject. He finds a similar insight in Freud's psychology.60 We act within a pre-ordained narrative, and on a bounded stage. Role-sociology also clarifies the fact that the self in search of the good is a public character. Von Balthasar states,</page><page sequence="17">FRANCESCA MURPHY 243 '...the "I"... acts out its own destiny in the role...' (p. 252) The self finds and creates its moral shape only as it meets and rebounds on others, in the given role. It has to act, in public, in order to be real: but who defines its role? Can any social role draw out the total specificity of the self? Von Balthasar's examination of philosophy, psychology and sociology finds that the reality which each describes is too general to constitute the uniqueness of this one self. Unless the self has a veridical, personal reality, God will be the only real character in the drama. Finally we reach 1918: the year of the discovery of the dialogue principle, in the work of Ferdinand Ebner, Martin Buber, Gabriel Marcel and Franz Rosenzweig. All except Ebner, he says, are Jews: the 'I-Thou' principle is read out of the Bible, (pp. 626-7). Buber uncovers the 'eternal Thou'; but he has not the theological image of God's summons and questioning. Von Balthasar states: This is the only satisfying answer to the question 'who am I in my particularity?' This is the reply Franz Rosenzweig gives us... In the...Star of Redemption he discovers his 'philosophical Archimedean point' by means of which he aims to lift the Idealist system off its hinges. ...The one addressed by God does not love the other person as someone who 'shares the same nature' ... but as someone who is addressed by God in 'what is most individual to him'. ...revelation creates a reciprocal relationship between T and 'Thou' ... Once again at the centre, there is the question that heaven puts to the earth. ...If we had not discovered this unique 'name' (Rosenzweig) of the individual addressed by God...the irreplaceable human being... we would not have been justified in attempting a theory of theo-drama. (pp. 636, 638, 645) In the Theo-drama, it is God's call which 'finds' the particular reality of each human self. Thus to be found is no interior conversion, but a sending. A role is not an experience but a direction in which to go. This is captured in the Biblical narratives in which God preemptorily imposes a new name: Saul becomes Paul, apostle to the Gentiles. 'You will be called' means 'you will become'.61 We asked whether the presence of being takes priority over its absence. For Gabriel Marcel, faith in the reality of being is 'fidelity' to a beloved 'thou'. It is witnessed by the refusal to admit that this thou must disappear into death.62 Von Balthasar says that Marcel has grasped the reality which the Song of Songs knew: that love and death meet, in the implication of sacrificial death for the other.63 The hero of the theo-drama is Christ. Crucifixion and Resurrection are the turning place of the conflict. In the space of the Cross, the human personae 'put on' their role, or mission, so to join the play as unique selves. To participate in Christ's representative</page><page sequence="18">244 'LOVE AS STRONG AS DEATH' death is to gain the unique mission, to which the 'I' can respond with the depths of its own particular reality. VIII. CONCLUSION Here lies a paradox. Von Balthasar, a mediaeval Christian and, in truth, no ecumenical thinker, nevertheless recognised that Judaism and Christianity are bound to the shared 'whipping-post' of revelation,64 Both he and Rosenzweig perceived that a dramatic interpretation of revelation speaks to the requirements of twentieth century theology: negatively, to extricate it from the mentalist Laacoon of Idealism, and positively, to interpret God's action as a engagement of divine Thou and human 'I', thus to hold in relation theory, praxis and contemplation, truth, goodness and beauty. According to Rosenzweig, the domain of beauty precedes that of speech, or the good in action. He says that the ...work of art must be closed off by a crystalline wall from everything that is not itself.65 Roman Ingarden argued that the potential meaning of the artistic object can only be realised by conscious acts which concretize its meaning intentions, thus giving it actuality as an aesthetic object.66 Rosenzweig claims likewise that, ...we...alluded to the external inadequacy of the work of art ...—in the necessity of performance or publication or...in the necessity of the observer for the full existence of the work...67 For von Balthasar, that work of art which is scripture is known in the performing of it. What is re-enacted is not Mark as story, but Mark as event. Thus are beauty and the good which is to be done maintained together. Scripture flows as it moves with the history which it purports to define, albeit that its precision is that of a witness, not a slide-rule. Its stories are not structures detached from a testifying subject. Rosenzweig argues that the evidence of the miracle of revelation is the 'eyewitness.' He claims that both the Jewish and the Christian scriptures have their truth in the fact that someone has been willing to die for them. The purpose of the 'trial' of Job is to show this.68 The metaphor for Job which Rosenzweig found in I and Thou is the movement between the 'I—It', which removes itself from relation, and the 'I-Thou's self-giving witness'. Von Balthasar would say that the knowledge of the truth of revelation is never the work of anonymous 'orthodoxy', but depends on self-inclusion, or 'ortho-praxy'. Proceeding a little further than he did, we might say that the original claim of the early</page><page sequence="19">FRANCESCA MURPHY 245 church was not that its scriptures had been timelessly and inerrantly chan nelled into the minds of their authors by God, but that the authors are, or are closely linked to, the witnesses. The character of God, in this revealed story, illuminates its truth from within: Rosenzweig says that: 'The truth is this shining of the divine visage alone. It is not a figure of its own, hovering freely, but solely the countenance of God shining forth. In the Star of Redemption... in which we saw divine truth become figure, there shines forth none other than the countenance which God turns shiningly toward us.'
