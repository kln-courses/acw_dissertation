<plain_text><page sequence="1">'Dogmatical' Dryden: Translating the Georgics in the Age of Politeness1 Paul Davis 'Dogmatical' is not an adjective we would nowadays think of applying to John Dryden. Since Philip Harth began his Contexts of Dryden 's Thought (1968) by saying that 'Most discussions of Dryden's characteristic thought are governed by a set of assumptions about his scepticism . . . which have been accepted ... for the past thirty years',2 thirty more years have passed and little has changed. Defining the 'dogmatical way' of Lucretius in the Preface to Sylvae (1685) as 'a certain kind of noble pride, and positive assertion of his opinions', Dryden famously contrasted his own 'natural diffidence and scepticism';3 and today's leading commentators on his work continue to take him at his word. For David Hopkins he is an ambivalent or unsystematic writer, an explorer of contradictory voices.4 For Cedric D. Reverand II and Paul Hammond he is a 'subversive' poet whose mature works interrogate our desire 'to make connections, discover inherent systems of value, and build theories', the author of 'fictions which exhibit both their materials and their gaps' in order to provoke their readers 'to reflect on how their own conceptual and political worlds are constructed'.5 There are, without doubt, good grounds for believing that Dryden was 'inclin'd to Scepticism' (Preface to Religio Laid; Poems, II, 86). The Restoration court, the court he served and has come to symbolize, was awash with sceptical ideas, imbibed during its years of exile in Paris, where the writings of the ancient sceptics were much in vogue. In the early stages of his career, he was an enthusiastic propagandist for the newly-founded Royal Society, whose scrupulous experimental procedures would, he announced, put an end to the epistemological 'tyranny' 'wherein our ancestors betrayed / Their free-born reason' to the arch- dogmatist Aristotle, 'And made his torch their universal light' ('To my Honoured Friend Dr. Charleton', 1-4). Later, in his satirical masterpieces, he attacked Shaftesbury as a dogmatical democrat, who 'Maintains the multitude can never err, / And sets the people in the papal chair' (The Medal, 86-7). Even his own eventual submission to papal discipline, his</page><page sequence="2">Paul Davis 29 conversion to a faith resented as violently 'dogmatical' by the majority of his compatriots, is perhaps best explained in terms of his sceptical anxiety about divergences of opinion in doctrinal matters. In Roman Catholicism, so the argument goes, Dryden found what he had been searching for throughout his religious life: a source of ecclesiastical authority capable of regulating the chaotic swirl of competing private interpretations of the Bible.6 Nevertheless, the current belief that scepticism is the key to Dryden's life and work needs some qualification, and not only because of the ironies attendant on basing a theory about Dryden on his sceptical attitude to theories. Protestations of 'diffidence and scepticism' were common in the Restoration, when memories of the conventicles and their murderous ceminties were fresh. Dry den's contemporaries used the words 'dogmatical' and 'sceptical' as tokens of religious and political affiliation, like coloured ribbons, as often as they used them to discriminate epistemological standpoints. When the founders of the Royal Society declared war on dogmatism they were (as is now understood) taking sides in Restoration church politics, attempting to align the new science with latitudinarian orthodoxy.7 In their turn they were accused by the opponents of that orthodoxy, men like Hobbes and the erstwhile republican Henry Stubbe, of harbouring ambitions to dogmatize, like popish priests, over the realm of natural philosophy.8 In Dryden's day, one man's sceptic was another man's dogmatist. So it was with Dryden himself. This essay is concerned with a work of his, the translation of the Georgics, which drew down upon him accusations of dogmatism. Dryden made the translation in the early 1 690s, at a time when he had forfeited his eminence in English culture for his Roman Catholicism, and when, retired to the consolations of private life, he was (it is usually supposed) more than ever detached and sceptical in his outlook. Yet certain of his contemporaries found the translation offensively 'dogmatical': in what follows I try to show why this was. Over the course of the three centuries since Dryden's Georgics was first published, its antagonists have been relegated to the footnotes of history, casualties of the process of literary canonization. This essay seeks to exhume them, and their reasons for disliking the poem, not out of any sour conviction that the canonical primacy of Dryden's Works of Virgil (1697) is the result merely of cultural power-relations and needs to be 'demystified' (on the contrary, there's nothing mysterious about it), but in the hope of restoring to view a controversial 'edge' in Dryden's Virgil, another reason why it deserves to be known as the English Virgil.</page><page sequence="3">30 'Dogmatical ' Dryden In the final section of Book III of the Georgics, Virgil gives the prospective farmer advice about dealing with outbreaks of disease among his livestock. One sign of impending disaster, he reveals, is a ewe which wanders off into the shade to graze on its own. If the farmer sees one of his flock doing this, he must act swiftly. In Dryden's English: where thou seest a Sheep remain In shades aloof, or couch'd upon the Plain; Or listlessly to crop the tender Grass; Or late to lag behind, with truant pace: Revenge the Crime; and take the Traytor's head, E're in the faultless Flock the dire Contagion spread. (in, 705-10) This struck the country parson and amateur Virgilian Luke Milbourne, author of Notes on Dryden's Virgil in a Letter to a Friend (1698), as vindictive, an unconscionably violent remedy. 'Why is it a Crime for a Sheep to be sick?', he protested, 'Or how comes the sick Creature to be a Traytor? Or why must he lose his Head? These Questions, I confess, are to me unanswerable.' But he did answer them, by implication at least, when, coming across the epithet 'holy Butcher' a few lines later in the translation, he commented sarcastically: 'this becomes Mr. Dryden and doubtless, is the true English of such a sacerdos as he would have made, had he been admitted'. For Milbourne, cruelty to animals was only to be expected in Dryden's translation of the Georgics, which was the work of a 'holy Butcher', a member of a dogmatical persecuting church, a Roman Catholic poet 'most unmerciful ... in his Reflections'.9 Commentators have generally paid little mind to Milbourne's caustic observations about Dryden's Pastorals and Georgics (he never made it to the Aeneis, having run out of space, if not bile). Beneflced in the aftermath of the 'Glorious' Revolution, and a virulent anti-Catholic,10 Milbourne has been set down as an unreliable witness ever since Dr Johnson gave it as his opinion that 'his outrages seem to be the ebullitions of a mind agitated by stronger resentment than bad poetry can excite, and previously resolved not to be pleased'.11 The tradition runs unbroken from Johnson through Sir Walter Scott: either poetical rivalry, for he had also thought of translating Virgil himself, or political animosity, for he seems to have held revolution principles, or deep resentment for Dryden's sarcasms against the clergy, or, most probably, all these united, impelled Milbourne to publish a most furious criticism12</page><page sequence="4">Paul Davis 3 1 and down to Dryden's latest biographer, James Anderson Winn: 'Milbourne rankled at the lack of respect [Dryden] accorded to the clergy, and the success of Dryden's Virgil was particularly irksome to him because his own translation ... had been ignored."3 There is plenty in the Notes to indicate that these judgements are accurate.14 Nevertheless, of poems as of people, true words are sometimes spoken in enmity; and it seems to me that Milbourne's questions about the treatment of the diseased sheep in Book III of Dryden's Georgics open up to scrutiny a feature of the translation's style which has gone unremarked by more respectful readers. Admirers of the translation have long praised Dryden (and rightly so) for his sensitivity to the anthropomorphic touches scattered here and there in Virgil's descriptions of animals in the Georgics. By bringing out those touches, Dryden, it is said, invites us to 'acknowledge the numerous resemblances and overlaps between human and non-human nature'. He juxtaposes the human and animal kingdoms with 'mock- heroic' results: 'the opportunities for irony are continually used'; 'the effect . . . depends upon consciously playing off one kind of experience against another'; we are brought to 'see the processes of the natural world in rapid succession (and sometimes simultaneously) from positions of amused distance and warm intimacy'.'5 Such remarks describe well the intricate workings of one type of anthropomorphic effect in the translation, the type Dryden uses, for instance, in his celebrated account of the 'intestine Broils' in the beehive in Book IV: With gorgeous Wings the Marks of Sov'raign Sway, The two contending Princes make their way; Intrepid thro' the midst of danger go; Their friends encourage, and amaze the Foe. With mighty Souls in narrow Bodies prest, They challenge, and encounter Breast to Breast; So flx'd on Fame, unknowing how to fly, And obstinately bent to win or dye; That long the doubtful Combat they maintain, Till one prevails (for one can only Reign.) Yet all those dreadful deeds, this deadly fray, A cast of scatter'd Dust will soon alay, And undecided leave the Fortune of the day. (IV, 120-32) Here 'warm intimacy' and 'amused distance' do indeed alternate in the fashion of mock-heroic; as the line 'So fix'd on Fame, unknowing how to</page><page sequence="5">3 2 'Dogmatical ' Dry den fly' particularly shows, the bees are both aggrandized with 'gorgeous' metaphor, and cut down to size with casts of literal 'dust'. Drawn into the spectacle of them heroically contemning flight, we then detach ourselves 'in rapid succession', even 'simultaneously', and see them as ludicrously flightless. But the type of anthropomorphic effect used in the lines about the diseased ewe is altogether different. Where, on a scale running from 'warm intimacy' to 'amused distance', should we place the idea of treating sickness in an animal (and a sheep at that, the archetype of animal innocence) as a crime whose lawful punishment is death? Nowhere, I suggest; it is off that scale. To talk of 'irony' or 'playing off in this context would be inappropriate, a palpable misrepresentation of the effect which is not sophisticated and ambivalent, but simple and extreme. Whatever his motives, Milbourne recognized as much. His protests about the lines suggest that for contemporary tastes, and not only to delicate modern sensibilities, they had a barbaric savour. The history of the treatment of animals supports this conclusion: though cows and pigs and dogs were commonly tried and executed according to the formal processes of human justice throughout the Middle Ages, and, less frequently, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the practice had died out by Dry den's time. In England such trials 'seem not to have occurred','6 perhaps because they were regarded as further evidence of the primitivism and cruelty of continental Roman Catholic cultures. Yet there are many examples of animals, and even plants, being held humanly responsible for their actions, as if these actions were freely willed rather than instinctive or adventitious, and being punished accordingly in Dryden's Georgics. A vein of barbaric anthropomorphism runs through the translation, a savage counterpart to its more educated interest in the 'overlaps between human and non-human nature': that's the proper Time to thrash the Wood For Mast of Oak, your Fathers homely Food. To gather Laurel-berries, and the Spoil Of bloody Myrtles, and to press your Oyl. For stalking Cranes to set the guileful Snare, T' inclose the Stags in Toy Is, and hunt the Hare. With Balearick Slings, or Gnossian Bow, To persecute from far the flying Doe; Then, when the Fleecy Skies new cloath the Wood, And cakes of rustling Ice come rolling down the Flood. (i, 409-18)</page><page sequence="6">Paul Davis 33 when the rooted Vines, with steady Hold, Can clasp their Elms, then Husbandman be bold To lop the disobedient Boughs, that stray'd Beyond their Ranks: let crooked Steel invade The lawless Troops, which Discipline disclaim, And their superfluous Growth with Rigour tame. (II, 505-10) not Decembers Frost that burns the Boughs, Nor Dog-days parching Heat that splits the Rocks, Are half so harmful as the greedy Flocks: Their venom'd Bite, and Scars indented on the Stocks. For this the Malefactor Goat was laid On Bacchus Altar, and his forfeit paid. (II, 519-24) Ev'n in the lowest Months, when Storms have shed From Vines the hairy Honours of their Head; Not then the drudging Hind his Labour ends; But to the coming Year his Care extends: Ev'n then the naked Vine he persecutes; His Pruning Knife at once Reforms and Cuts. (ii, 558-63) Receits abound; but searching all thy Store, The best is still at hand, to launch the Sore: And cut the Head; for till the Core be found, The secret Vice is fed, and gathers ground. While making fruitless moany the Shepherd stands, And when the launching Knife requires his hands, Vain help, with idle Prayers from Heav'n demands. (Ill, 690-6) Human nature is not a gift entertainingly lavished on the plants and animals in these lines, but a burden disturbingly forced upon them: straggling vines are 'disobedient' and so ripe for 'discipline'; a goat which grazes the farmer's young plants is a 'Malefactor', its life 'forfeit'; ewes which pass on 'scabby Tetter' are conspiring in 'secret Vice'. Each time, though Virgil provides an initial anthropomorphic hint, it is Dryden who gives the vindictive twist. He develops Virgil's mention of the blood- red colour of the myrtles ('cruentaq; myrta', I, 306) into a miniature massacre, 'gather ... the Spoil / Of bloody Myrtles'. He fleshes out</page><page sequence="7">34 'Dogmatical* Dry den Virgil's half-line of analogy between vine-growing and government ('Exerce imperia', II, 370) into a four-and-a-half-line conceit, a full-scale purge, 'then Husbandman be bold ... with Rigour tame'. And he amplifies Virgil's unelaborated reference to the guilt ('culpam', II, 380) of the sacrificial goat into a salutary tale of 'greed' justly punished.17 This vindictive streak in the translation played into Milbourne's hands as he sought to present Dryden's Georgics as a 'most unmerciful' work, the work of a 'holy Butcher'. Time and again, Dryden's model husbandman sounds like a practitioner of popery and arbitrary government: he 'persecutes', he 'lops the disobedient', he 'invades' with 'Steel', he 'Reforms and cuts'. Similar images of georgical repression had lately been used by Samuel Parker, who was commonly accused of popish and absolutist sympathies,18 to bolster the case for persecuting the dissenters. With Dryden's exhortation to the farmer whose flock is infected with 'tetter' to 'launch the Sore: / And cut the Head; for till the Core be found, / The secret Vice is fed, and gathers ground', compare, for instance, this recommendation of Parker's about handling the separatists: 'we must lance their Tumour, and take out the Core of their proud Flesh before we can cure them . . . Anodynes and softer Medicines make no Impressions upon them, to treat smoothly does but feed the humour.'19 Or, more generally, note that the principle which Dryden's husbandman so implacably upholds, the principle that a single sick animal must always be sacrificed for the good of the flock, had more than once been invoked by Parker to justify cutting out the dire contagion of Puritan separatism before it could spread in the faultless Anglican flock: Private interest must yield to Publick Good, and therefore, when they cannot stand together, and there is no Remedy but one must suffer, 'tis better certainly that One, or a Few, should perish than the whole Community. It is not properly the end of Government to punish Enormities, as to prevent Disturbances; and when they bring Malefactors to Justice ... they do not so much inflict a Punishment upon the Crime ... as provide for the welfare of the Commonwealth, by cutting off such Persons as are Pests and Enemies to it. (pp. 220-1) In the Latin, the lone diseased ewe in Georgics III, the ewe which Dryden condemns as a 'Traytor', is presented thus:</page><page sequence="8">Paul Davis 35 Quam procul, aut molli succedere saepius umbrae Videris, aut summas carpente ignavi herbas, Extremamq; sequi, aut medio procumbere campo Pascentem, &amp; serae solam decedere nocti; Continuo ferro culpam compesce, priusquam Dira per incautum serpant contagia vulgus. (in, 464-9) What is the antecedent of the relative 'Quam' here? The most recent editor of the poem suggests 'Ovem', 'easily supplied from the context', and he adds that 'when we expect its antecedent, in 468, there is a break in the construction ... to emphasise that immediate action is required'.20 But if 'Ovem', the expected antecedent of 'Quam', does not appear in line 468, a grammatically viable alternative antecedent does, another feminine noun in the accusative singular: 'culpam'. By a form of syntactic compression, the sick ewe has in effect been relegated to the status of 'an abstraction, culpa\ 'a defect'.21 This denaturing transformation comes as an especially sharp shock after the preceding four lines, in which Virgil has given a 'sympathetic' anthropomorphizing picture of the ewe22 ('molli succedere saepius umbrae / Videris' in particular, with its precise compound verb and richly synaesthetic epithet, coaxes us into identifying with the feverish animal as it lets itself fall back wearily on cool shaded grass). The 'break in the construction', then, is also a break in Virgil's poetic voice: the gentle accents of a shepherd in whose eyes each of his flock has an individual character give way suddenly to the harsh tones of a farmer for whom sheep are merely a source of income, and who consequently regards any sign of sickness in his flock as a blameworthy threat to his livelihood. A modern scholar of Virgil might say of such a tonal break that it is indicative of the nature of the Georgics as a whole. Some recent scholarship on the poem has characterized it as a hybrid, an unstable compound of two antithetical Roman conceptions of poetic style: the 'vatic' and the 'neoteric'. The vates, the older pre- Augustan type of Roman poet, wrote in an uncomplicated nationalist vein, with the ambition 'of altering a people's view of itself and its destinies', whereas the neoteroi, the 'new poets' who came to the fore in Virgil's youth, acknowledged 'no social responsibility' as the motivation for their work, and were influenced instead by sophisticated Hellenistic canons of taste.23 The Aeneid has long been thought to owe a dual allegiance to these traditions, to have 'two voices', one robustly dutiful and public, the other private and delicately melancholic.24 The Georgics too is now read as a work creatively in two minds about the 'polar opposites of Roman</page><page sequence="9">36 'Dogmatical* Dry den experience' in the Augustan age, 'on the one hand austerity, discipline, and a tradition of civic responsibility; on the other, luxury, self- indulgence'.25 The poem's luxurious 'neoteric' voice, we are told, was second nature to Virgil, who was connected by his upbringing and perhaps also by inclination with the neoteroi* but for its uncongenial austerity, for its coarser didactic voice, he went back (principally) to his great 'vatic' predecessor Lucretius.27 The fit between these two voices is occasionally (and intentionally) awkward, and the lines about the sick ewe are a case in point. There, on this modern reading of the poem, 'neoteric' reverie is rudely interrupted by 'vatic' pragmatism, by two atavistic Lucretian outbursts: 'continuo' ('without hesitation'), a favourite particle in the De Rerum Natural and the imperative 'compesce' (the imperative being, of course, a staple verb-form in Lucretius). I think that Dryden felt this incursion of Lucretius into the lines, and was attempting to replicate the sudden reactionary effect when he translated them. The answer to Milbourne's questions about his translation of the passage is that Dryden intended its primitivizing cruelty ('Revenge the Crime', 'take the Traytor's head') as an equivalent of the stylistic recidivism, the flashback (so to speak), which he had recognized in the original. He was well placed to recognize that 'flashback', for two reasons. Firstly, he had translated from Virgil and Lucretius in quick succession for Sylvae (1685), and had written of their 'distinguishing character [s]' in its preface, finding them to be temperamental opposites: Lucretius everywhere proud and assertive, no respecter of social decorum, 'assuming an absolute command not only over his vulgar reader but even his patron Memmius ... and using a magisterial authority while he instructs him'; Virgil a model of civility, 'stately without ambition', preserving 'exact propriety' in all things {Poems, II, 246, 242, 243). Secondly, as has lately been shown by Eric Griffiths, it was an aspect of Dryden's own 'distinguishing character' as a poet that he was nervily attuned to the vestiges of primitivism which incubate, like a virus, within purportedly civilized cultures; to the 'ghosts of former, less trained selves, who loom up, uninvited', on neoclassical characters as they 'strive towards stateliness'.29 A look back at the passages I cited earlier, which feature vindictive anthropomorphizing effects comparable to those in the episode of the diseased ewe, supports my belief that, when Dryden sounds 'most unmerciful' in his Georgia, he does so because he has picked up a momentary resurgence of Lucretian dogmatism within the civil demeanour of Virgil's poem. These pulses of dogmatical energy affect Dryden's translation like electric shocks, sending it into paroxysms of</page><page sequence="10">Paul Davis 37 indecorous diction. So, for instance, Dryden's 'the proper Time to thrash the Wood ... To gather Laurel-berries, and the Spoil / Of bloody Myrtles' gets its brute urgency from a clump of time-conjunctions in the original ('Sed tamen &amp; ... turn tempus', 'Tune', 'turn', I, 305-8; 'but even then', 'right then', 'without delay'), a dogmatical device Virgil dredged up from Lucretius. Similarly, 'Husbandman be bold / To lop the disobedient Boughs, that stray'd / Beyond their Ranks: let crooked Steel invade / The lawless Troops' conveys the charge of Virgil's insistent 'Inde ubi jam', 'turn', 'turn', 'turn denique' (II, 366-9), and also of another characteristic trait of the Lucretian 'dogmatical way' he reaches back to at this point, a string of verbs in the imperative ('stringe', 'tonde', 'Exerce', 'compesce', II, 368-70; 'strip them', 'clip them', 'dominate them', 'cut them back'). In the case of 'cut the Head; for till the Core be found, / The secret Vice is fed, and gathers ground', it is even possible that Dryden had identified an allusion to Lucretius: Virgil's 'Ulceris os: alitur vitium, vivitque tegendo' (III, 454) may recall De Rerum Natura, IV, 1068, 'ulcus enim vivescit et inveterascit alendo', a line included in one of the passages Dryden had translated for Sylvae as: 'For every hour some deadlier symptom shows, / And by delay the gathering venom grows' ('Lucretius: The Fourth Book', 23-4).30 Dryden's acute, not to say disproportionate, response to these moments of Lucretian influence in the Georgics suggests that, in translating the poem, he came to think of its relationship with the De Rerum Natura as rather more confrontational than he had made it sound a decade or so earlier, in the preface to Sylvae: If [Lucretius] was not of the best age of Roman poetry, he was at least of that which preceded it; and he himself refined it to that degree of perfection, both in the language and the thoughts, that he left an easy task to Virgil, who, as he succeeded him in time, so he copied his excellencies: for the method of the Georgics is plainly derived from him. Lucretius had chosen a subject naturally crabbed; he therefore adorned it with poetical descriptions, and precepts of morality in the beginning and ending of his books; which you see Virgil has imitated with great success in those four books, which in my opinion are more perfect in their kind than even his divine Aeneids. The turn of his verse he has likewise followed, in those places which Lucretius has most laboured, and some of his very lines he has transplanted into his own works without much variation. (Poems, II, 245-6)</page><page sequence="11">38 'Dogmatical' Dry den This describes an 'easy' transition, a transition whose fluency is acted out in the grooved parallelism 'as he succeeded him in time, so he copied his excellencies'. Yet notice how the claim that the transition from Lucretius to Virgil was a smooth one, as Dryden expresses it here, already contains within it the seeds of his subsequent change of mind. He broaches it concessively - 'If he was not of the best age of Roman poetry, he was at least of that which preceded it' - as though foreseeing the rebuke that Lucretius was a boorish, unAugustan poet, not suitable for cultivated Restoration ears. That misgiving air persists throughout the passage, notably at 'those places which Lucretius has most laboured', where Dryden's insistence that there are polished lines in the De Rerum Natura is weakened by his tacit admission that, since Lucretius was a stranger to the Augustan art of concealing art, those lines reek of the hard labour, the brute force, which went into polishing them. In place of these misgivings about the compatibility of Lucretius and Virgil, what emerges from Dryden's translation of the Georgics is his conviction that as poetic characters they were substantially incompatible, and that their incompatibility was essential to the design of the poem. The 'dogmatical way' of Lucretius shows through the civil Virgilian surface of Dryden's Georgics, like a pornographic cartoon beneath a layer of landscape, and it does so not because Dryden mistook Virgil's 'distinguishing character', but because he felt it was crucial to Virgil's intention in writing the poem that it should be written partly out of character. Defining a good verse translation in the Preface to Ovid's Epistles (1680), Dryden had insisted that it must preserve the 'particular turn of thoughts, and of expression' of the poet being translated, 'which are the characters that distinguish, and as it were individuate him from all other writers' (Poems, I, 389); in his translation of the Georgics he met the spirit and not only the letter of that obligation, recognizing it as one of Virgil's characteristic virtues that he was not so individuated as to turn a deaf ear to the characteristic virtues of 'other writers'. In a fine essay on Dryden's translations of Lucretius, Emrys Jones has argued that Dryden responded to the 'primitive feel about the verse' of the De Rerum Natura, its 'rough, impatient, unliterary quality', as to a quality his own cultivated lines damagingly lacked.31 Dryden's Georgics suggests that he knew Virgil had preceded him in being brought by Lucretius to hear the limitations of a civil style, to hear that for a poet as for his nation (in Dryden's great words to Congreve) what is 'gain'd in skill' is commonly 'lost in strength' ('To my Dear Friend Mr. Congreve', 12). This belief that in the Georgics Virgil was seeking to stiffen the accomplished character of his verse with Lucretian 'dogmatical' force is fundamental to Dryden's translation of the poem. For 'strength',</page><page sequence="12">Paul Davis 39 'primitive' strength, is more than occasional decoration in Dry den's Georgics; it is the translation's home key. Taking the Lucretian moments in Virgil's poem to be the bedrock of its imaginative vision, rather than so many prurient peeps at the savage past, Dryden set his Georgics not in the Augustan world, the world of the early principate, but in an altogether less civilized age, a precarious and terrifying age in which culture has barely taken root, so that whatever tenuous advances are achieved by men involve labour so unrelentingly hard as to be indistinguishable from violence. Far from believing that Virgil's Georgics 'speak of how man cultivates the earth, managing its resources and acting in conformity with natural laws so as to achieve the best return for his labour',32 Dryden consolidated out of the poem's intermittent Lucretian undertones a grim vision of unregenerate 'hard' primitivism, a Hobbesian state of nature regulated only by the brutish energies of unsocialized passion. When man cultivates the earth or manages its resources in Dryden's Georgics, he is pitting his passions against those of the non-human world, subduing an unruly environment, if at all, only by naked force. Signs of this impassioned struggle are everywhere in the translation. Dryden habitually adds a tincture of passion to Virgil's descriptions of the farmer's environment, so that the farmer's passionate repression of that environment, which Dryden also scales up, comes to seem necessitated under the brutal logic of self-preservation. Of the many examples of him raising the stakes in this way I have chosen three. Early in his version of Book I we hear that any farmer will be rewarded by Ceres, who plows across the furrow'd Grounds, And on the Back of Earth inflicts new Wounds: For he with frequent Exercise Commands Th' unwilling Soil, and tames the stubborn Lands. (I, 141-4) But the price of the goddess's favour is higher in Dryden's English than it is in Virgil's Latin: 'unwilling' and 'stubborn' are both Dryden's alone, Virgil having simply the noun 'tellurem'; and 'on the Back of Earth inflicts new Wounds' seems to take the words 'proscisso' and 'terga' in Virgil as an ablative absolute ('cut ... back') whereas in fact the former agrees with 'aequore', 'plain', and the latter means 'ridges of earth' (Geor. I, 97). When the consequences of scrupling to undertake such 'Labours' are spelled out a hundred lines later, Dryden is again more implacable than Virgil:</page><page sequence="13">40 'Dogmatical' Dry den unless the Land with daily Care Is exercis'd, and with an Iron War, Of Rakes and Harrows, the proud Foes expelFd, And Birds with clamours frighted from the Field; Unless the Boughs are lopp'd that shade the Plain, And Heav'n invok'd with Vows for fruitful Rain: On other Crops you may with envy look, And shake for Food the long abandoned Oak. (i, 231-8) For 'the proud Foes' there is no source in the original, for 'Iron War' only the mild provocation of 'insectabere' (I, 155). And war is what Dryden urges farmers to wage against not only the vegetable but also the animal kingdom: as he translates it, Book III includes the following pitiless passage about breeding livestock: As for the Females, with industrious Care Take down their Mettle, keep 'em lean and bare; When conscious of their past delight, and keen To take the leap, and prove the sport again: With scanty measure then supply their food; And, when athirst, restrain 'em from the flood: Their Bodies harrass, sink 'em when they run; And fry their melting Marrow in the Sun. an, 208-15) 'Conscious of their past delight', 'keen to take the leap', and 'and prove the sport again' triplicate Virgil's 'ubi concubit primos jam nota voluptas / Sollicitat' (III, 1 30-1), overturning its emphasis: Dryden's mares are culpably licentious, Virgil's no more than passive dupes of instinct. When Luke Milbourne objected to Dryden's treatment of the diseased sheep in Book III, he was objecting to this habit of Dryden's, the habit of dropping into a primitive Lucretian voice and using it to present the relationship between the farmer and his environment as one of brutish antagonism. Milbourne's protesting 'why must he lose his head?' was no mere opportunistic sectarian hit (or not only that), but part of a wider pattern of critical perception: again and again, the points in the translation where Dryden escalates the violence involved in georgical labour are the points which draw disgusted comment from Milbourne. Why, he wonders, for instance, are 'Iron War, distant War &amp;c.' expressions Dryden is so 'wonderfully fond of that he writes 'First</page><page sequence="14">Paul Davis 41 Ceres taught, the Ground with Grain to sow, / And arm'd with Iron Shares the crooked Plough', when 'Virgil says, only, she taught Men to Plow? When Dry den's 'Farmer, now secure of Fear, / Sends in the Swains to spoil the finished Year', Milbourne asks 'What fear does Mr Dryden mean which the Farmer should be secure of, or come to that, 'who ever, before our Rhymer, call'd Reaping spoiling of the finish'd Year?'" His acuity may have been second-hand. The reason why those turns of phrase so grated on Milbourne's sensibilities was perhaps that they were markedly out of tune with the principles for interpreting the Georgics laid down in the critical account of Virgil's poem which he had readiest to hand as he prepared his attack on Dryden's translation, since it had been printed as a preface to that translation: Joseph Addison's 'Essay on the Georgics'. If so, Milbourne was only the first to take his opinions about Virgil's poem from this 'Essay', the influence of which, John Chalker writes, 'upon subsequent attitudes to the Georgics bore no relation to its size and scope'. Chalker goes on: 'When discussing this type of didactic poetry both early and mid-[eighteenth-] century critics take Addison's dicta as their starting point, and often do little more than vary his phraseology ... as one reads these later critics it becomes clear that they see the Georgics through Addisonian spectacles, and that his critical attitude became the established one for some generations.'34 For Milbourne, and for those 'later critics', looking at the Georgics 'through Addisonian spectacles' meant shutting out what Dryden saw in the poem. Addison's friend and collaborator Thomas Tickell 'often wondered' in later years 'that [Dryden] did not ... acknowledge his obligation to Mr. Addison, for giving him The Essay upon the Georgics, prefixed to [his] translation';35 and if his devotion to the memory of his friend made him forgetful in that complaint (Dryden does, in fact, at the outset of his Virgil thank the 'two Worthy Friends of mine' who 'gave me ... the two Prefaces to the Pastorals, and the Georgics"), ,36 Tickell's loyalty was not altogether misguided. Dryden gives no sign that he held Addison's essay in the high regard it was to enjoy among eighteenth-century Virgilians, and it would have been strange if he had: his practice as a translator of the Georgics, and Addison's theorizing about the poem, are essentially at odds. The core of Addison's 'Essay on the Georgics' is a passage in which he compares Virgil's didactic manner with that of the reputed father of georgic, Hesiod. He finds that there is no comparison: Hesiod's Works and Days is no more than the 'first rough sketch of a Georgic', and not until the time of Virgil, not until the Georgics themselves, do 'we ... see the ... Figures reform'd, the Colouring laid on, and the whole Piece finish'd'. Hesiod is 'rough' because he is 'everywhere bent on</page><page sequence="15">42 'Dogmatical' Dry den Instruction', because, in Dryden's terms, he openly practises the 'dogmatical way\ Virgil, by contrast, is 'dogmatical' only in a qualified sense, which is what makes his verse feel Tmish'd'. The 'beauty' which Addison claimed is 'frequently met with' in the Georgics, and which he prized above any of the poem's other beauties, is 'the delivering the Precept . . . indirectly', so that, whereas in Hesiod 'precepts' are 'sown so very thick, that they clog the Poem too much', in Virgil they lie flush with the surrounding contours: he 'often conceals the Precept in a description, and represents his Country-Man performing the Action in which he wou'd instruct his Reader' (Works, V, 150, 153, 150, 147). There is an undercurrent of condescension in Addison's remarks, an undercurrent perceptible in his mock-rustic tautology 'they clog the Poem too much', and again, elsewhere, in his suavely sneering description of Hesiod as 'wonderfully Grave'. Dry den was always short with people who presumed that literary history was a history of progress from ancient vulgarity towards modern refinement, those, for instance, who were 'offended' that he had translated Chaucer into modern English 'because they . . . look on Chaucer as a dry, old-fashioned Wit, not worth receiving' (Preface to Fables; Kinsley, IV, 1457). In the particular case of didactic poetry, as I have shown, he did not think of the directly 'dogmatical way' as a quaint relic of outmoded times. But in this, Dry den was somewhat singular. Having already taken hold in the town by means of its connection with Dryden's Virgil (the connection of a parasite to an unwilling host), the sneering Addisonian attitude to ancient didactic poets was given academic sanction at Oxford in 171 1, in a lecture delivered by Thomas Tickell, 'De poesi didactica'. Tickell said of the Georgics that 'the more it teaches us the more it charms us ... the usefulness of its Precepts [being] hidden in the colours of language'. But, aping Addison's curl of the lip, Tickell warned his listeners that in didactic poems written before the Georgics they would encounter only 'Packets of Precepts and sane Counsels enclosed in dactyls and spondees with wonderful soberness'.37 When, forty years later, Joseph Warton, Professor of Poetry at Oxford and himself a translator of Virgil, observed in his 'Reflections on Didactic Poetry' that Virgil had outgrown such 'wonderful soberness' and instead 'turn[ed] rules into images', he was stating the orthodox.38 i he orthodox, but not the obvious. Though its good faith has gone unquestioned and its standing remains high, Addison's 'Essay on the Georgics' is a partial treatment of the poem, which achieves its interpretative goals by high-handed manipulations of Virgil's verse. Consider the 'one Instance out of a multitude of this nature' which he gives of Virgil's enlightened belief that 'the plain and direct mention' of</page><page sequence="16">Paul Davis 43 duties was no longer required in his untutorable times. 'It is in the Second Georgic where he tells us what Trees will bear Grafting on each other', writes Addison, and he quotes: Et saepe alterius ramos impune videmus, Vertere in alterius, mutatamq; insita mala Ferre pyrum, &amp; prunis lapidosa rubescere coma. Steriles Platani malos gessere valentes, Castaneae fagos, ornusq; incanuit albo Flore pyri; Glandemq; sues fregere sub ulmis. Nee longum tempus: &amp; ingens Exjit ad Coelum ramis felicibus arbos; Miraturq; novas frondes, &amp; non sua poma.39 It is no surprise that Addison chose to quote these lines, for they demonstrate the specious descriptive wit which he admired in the poem: at '&amp; prunis lapidosa rubescere corna' ('and stony cornels blushing on the plum') Virgil 'is ... not thinking of utility, but of the pictorial effect'; 'incanuit albo' is 'a colourful pleonasm';40 and at 'Miraturq; novas frondes, &amp; non sua poma', Virgil 'with a great Beauty applies . . . Wonder ... to his Trees'. What is surprising, however, is that Addison writes of the lines as if they were a single continuous passage, 'one Instance'. To be sure, his dashes concede that some text has been omitted, but they make it look like a matter of two hemistichs, whereas in fact no fewer than fifty of Virgil's lines have been contracted into the nine it takes Addison to get from 'Et saepe alterius' to '&amp; non sua poma'. And among the lines Addison suppressed are ones which seriously undermine his claim that Virgilian georgic is a 'kind of Poetry [which] . . . raises in our Minds a pleasing variety of Scenes and Landskips whilst it teaches us; and makes the dryest of its Precepts look like a Description' (Works, V, 151, 146). Immediately after the pleasingly descriptive 'et prunis lapidosa rubescere corna', for instance, there follow in Virgil two-and-a- half lines in which notably 'plain and direct mention' is made (by means of three imperatives) of the farmer's laborious obligations: Quare agite o proprios generatim discite cultus, Agricolae, fructusque feros mollite colendo. Neu segnes jaceant terrae: (ii, 35-7) Similarly, not long before 'Steriles Platani malos gessere valentes', Virgil instructs his readers that 'Scilicet omnibus est labor impendendus, &amp;</page><page sequence="17">44 'Dogmatical* Dry den omnes / Cogendae in sulcum, ac multa mercede domandae' (II, 61-2), in a pair of lines whose clogging gerundives and thickly-sown spondees mark them out as 'wonderfully grave', or, one might say, Hesiodic.41 That the habit of distinguishing between Virgil's indirect methods of instruction and the directly didactic techniques of his forebears took hold in some quarters after the publication of Addison's 'Essay on the Georgics' had, I would suggest, less to do with the literary-critical facts of the matter than with the circumstances of English culture in the early eighteenth century. The appeal of the Addisonian interpretation of the Georgics was (in a foundational sense of the word) 'political': the alleged restraint of Virgil's didactic style could be made to function as a prototype of the newly sociable mode of behaviour which was being recommended in some quarters as an antidote to the dogmatism of English culture under the Stuarts. The so-called 'Court Whigs' encouraged the early eighteenth-century Englishman to see himself as produced by a process of historical change, which rendered him modern as distinct from his predecessors. His 'modern' characteristics . . . were defined ... as 'manners', 'politeness', 'taste', and other terms denoting increased capacity for civilised intercourse.42 To that way of thinking Addison's Virgil was a gift, a pristine example of the benefits of that 'historical change'. His Georgics were a model of what might be achieved in the way of 'civilised intercourse' once the old 'dogmatical way' had been abandoned. Addison wrote the 'Essay' 'some time in the year 1693', a year or so before he made his first overtures to the Whig court, and yet the germ of this Whiggish ideology of politeness may already be detected there.43 The chief architect of that ideology was to be the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, and work to date on the political dimensions of 'politeness' has concentrated on his writings.44 But both in its general argument and in the particularities of its rhetoric, Addison's 'Essay on the Georgics' is a forerunner of Shaftesbury 's Characteristicks (171 1). Shaftesbury 's 'Advice to an Author' that whereas 'in early days, Poets were look'd upon as authentick Sages, for dictating Rules of life', they have now 'lost their Pretension' and should 'secretly advise' at most 'whilst they profess only to please' might be said merely to make explicit the contemporary significance of Addison's contrast between Hesiod and Virgil. And his confidence that whereas the 'Impostures' of the dogmatists used to be 'rail'd at, with all the Bitterness and Vehemence imaginable', they now needed only to be 'touch'd ever so gently in this other way'45 (of raillery)</page><page sequence="18">Paul Davis 45 may have stemmed in part from his having heard Addison touch Hesiod with gentle raillery as a 'wonderfully Grave' poet. Whatever the relationship between Addison's 'Essay' and the development of Shaftesbury's ideas about 'politeness', there is evidence to show that Addison's reading of the Georgics was co-opted into the Whig effort to present English culture as having progressed from primitive dogmatism to modern sociability, to a point of stable civilization at which it was no longer necessary for private individuals to resort to 'positive assertion of ... Opinions'. Those who set out to establish the reputation of the Georgics as a politely didactic poem (and who did so dogmatically) were 'Court Whigs', so that, putting it flippantly, one might say that Addison's 'Essay' laid the groundwork for a Whig Interpretation of Virgil. His own career as a court writer is well documented, as is that of Tickell, but it is the case of William Benson, Surveyor-General and then Auditor of the Imprest under George I, and one of the 'hypercritics' immortalized in The Dunciady which most clearly demonstrates how the Addisonian account of the Georgics was adapted in the early eighteenth century to serve Whiggish ends. In 1724, Benson brought out Virgil's Husbandry, Or An Essay on the Georgics, an analysis and a translation of Book II of the poem, which was followed a year later by a second part dealing with Book I (to which references below apply). The Addisonian credentials of these performances are plain to see: Benson praises Virgil for shrouding instruction in metaphor, for instance, as "tis most necessary ... in Pieces of this Nature, because it flings the Stile out of the Didactic Trot' (sig. a4r). But the political lesson which Benson meant his readers to glean from Virgil's Husbandry he left unshrouded: at a time when anxiety was mounting about the corrupting effects of Walpole's expansion of parliamentary patronage, Benson offers the Georgics as a reminder to discontented 'Country Whigs' to count the blessings of the constitutional status quo: In short [Virgil] points out both to the Prince, and the People, what their Duty was to each other, and wherein their real Happiness consisted. And this very Constitution, which Virgil plann'd for his own Country, almost two thousand Years since, is the Constitution of the happiest People upon Earth at this Instant. (sig. a2v) Benson's ulterior political motive, his predetermination to make the poem conform with 'established, and oligarchic ideals' of polite poetic conduct, is felt throughout Virgil's Husbandry as a deforming influence. Of the poem's opening lines, for example, he remarks that</page><page sequence="19">46 'Dogmatical* Dry den [Virgil] mentions his Patron, but without any Ostentation; for he understood very well that it depended on his Success in the Work to shew that he deserv'd the Honour that was done him in being singled out by so great a Judge on such an Occasion. The Manner in which he lays down his Subject is with the greatest Modesty: Quid faciat, not Quid facit: quo sidere conveniat, et qui sit cultus; and the first mention he makes of himself, Hinc canere incipiam, expresses a becoming Diffidence. He only says, He will begin, or He will try to write on these Subjects in Verse; by which he suggests that they are so very difficult that he very much doubts how he may be able to go on with them. (sig. Air) This is literary-critical 'spin'. Benson sprays superlatives and doctors Virgil's words to suit his purposes. The subjunctives 'faciat', 'conveniat', and 'sit' (I, 1-4) are required by the grammatical construction of the sentence (it is an extended indirect question) and so do not connote 'modesty'. Nor does 'canere incipiam' (I, 5) express 'becoming Diffidence', since 'incipere' cannot mean 'to try' in the knowledge that the attempt is likely to fail,46 a fact which the glissade 'He will begin, or He will try' seeks to conceal by offering alternative renderings of the verb as equivalents. Given Benson's determination to 're-brand' Virgil as a politely acquiescent poet, a role-model for would-be rhymers in a 'finish'd' Georgian culture which (in Shaftesbury's words) 'however it may be taught, will not be tutor'd',47 it hardly needs saying that he detested Dryden's translation of the Georgics, finding it 'dogmatical, and vulgar, and mean' (sig. A2V). In the 'Postscript' to his Virgil, reflecting on his achievement, Dryden predicted that what I have done, Imperfect as it is, for want of Health and leisure to Correct it, will be judg'd in after Ages, and possibly in the present, to be no dishonour to my Native Country. (Works, VI, 807) Noting with hindsight what translators and commentators in the age after Dryden made of the Georgics, how they contracted its range of tone and muffled the force of its perceptions, one might agree that Dryden's translation of the poem was indeed 'no dishonour to my Native Country'. But would it not be unguarded to say that Dryden intended in</page><page sequence="20">Paul Davis 47 his translation of the Georgics to obviate reductive responses to the poem 'in after Ages'? In a literal sense, yes it would: Dryden was notorious for his belief in astrology, but there is no evidence that he was clairvoyant. Taking 'intended' in a wider sense, however, in the sense in which it is applicable to imaginative acts, it might plausibly be suggested that Dryden registered early indications of a coming shift in the moral atmosphere of his culture towards 'polite' Whiggish optimism, and that (at whatever level of consciousness) he compensated for that shift by accentuating the pessimistic 'dogmatical' dimension of the Georgics. To adapt some words of the Marquis of Halifax, sensing that 'one part of the Company' of Englishmen were 'weighing the Boat down on one side', Dryden moved in his translation 'to make it lean as much to the contrary'.48 He would not have been alone in doing so. There were those among Dryden's contemporaries, some of them his friends, who, detecting the new enthusiasm for the social, cultural, and commercial values of polite Whiggery, feared that confident prognostications of enlightenment were on the point of overwhelming more sober estimates of human capacity.49 Francis Atterbury, the high churchman and 'much Honourd Friend' to whom (under the terms of his draft advertisement to second subscribers) Dryden 'intrusted ... the Money subscribed to me for the Translation of Virgil' (Works, VI, 1 183-4), preached against the Whiggish presumption that 'in our Nation ... 'tis not difficult to foresee that Improvements will be made in every Art and Science',50 calling his congregations back to thoughts of original sin.51 Historians of the period have recognized for some time that the Augustinian idiom employed by high churchmen like Atterbury to counter Whig progressivism 'gave the Catholic' in England after the Glorious Revolution 'something ... substantial to share'52 with his disaffected countrymen. It may have been because he did share this Augustinian mentality that the 'dogmatical' side of the Georgics made itself heard to Dryden; the exacting Lucretian voice he took up in his translation of the poem perhaps shows that he was of the impolite belief that human beings, no matter how 'finish'd' they may consider themselves, will always need to be plainly 'tutor'd', and not only elegantly 'taught'. There is another possible explanation, a gloomier one in as much as it operates altogether outside the framework of Christian hope. If we take the 'dogmatical' pessimism of Dryden's Georgics as evidence that in his later years he was of an Augustinian cast of mind, this at least implies that he acknowledged the activity of grace in the world, working to transform the deficiencies of human effort. But it may be that what the Lucretian overtones of the Georgics offered Dryden, or what they inflicted upon him, was the chance to enter imaginatively into a world</page><page sequence="21">48 'Dogmatical' Dry den from which God has withdrawn, an Epicurean world in which, since right is absent, might is the only law. Jacobites and non-jurors (and Dryden was certainly one of the latter, and probably one of the former)53 characterized England after 1688 as just such a world. When, in 1691, not long before Dryden first turned his attention to the Georgics, William Sherlock published his The case of allegiance due to sovereign powers, which defended the legality of subscribing the oath to William and Mary on what appeared to be de facto grounds, it was immediately seized on by the non-jurors Jeremy Collier and John Kettle well as proof that even the supporters of the present king and queen recognized that their authority was founded not on legitimist grounds, but on the naked fact of conquest.54 There are points in Dryden's Georgics at which his sensitivity to Virgil's account of civilization as a process governed by the material realities of power seems enhanced by a comparable discontent with the de facto nature of Williamite rule. Early in Book II, for example, Dryden accentuates the force involved in techniques of grafting, in terms which may have been designed to reflect on William of Orange's illegitimate incursion into the English royal line: 'Tis usual now, an inmate Graff to see, With Insolence invade a Foreign Tree: Thus Pears and Quinces from the Crabtree come; And thus the ruddy Cornel bears the Plum. (II, 4i-5) "Tis usual now' strikes a Juvenalian rather than a Virgilian note, directing the reader's attention to a rather more pressing political present than does Virgil's 'saepe'. Yet it would be taking a narrow view of the question to argue that Dryden's translation of the Georgics is a Jacobitical party piece on the evidence of the connections it discerns between culture and coercion. As the grafting example demonstrates (and the analogies discussed earlier between ploughing and war, farming and repression, even more so), those connections are traced at so radical a level that they take on a certain inevitability. Under the terms of Dryden's analogy between grafting and invasion, to expel William from the Stuart family 'tree' would be tantamount to revoking the benefits of a process fundamental to the development of agriculture. "Tis usual now, an inmate Graff to see, / With Insolence invade a Foreign Tree' is as much a backward refusal to acknowledge the facts of change as it is an honourable lament for the abeyance of legitimist principles. Dryden was sometimes accused of acceding to the Williamite revolution on de facto Sherlockian grounds</page><page sequence="22">Paul Davis 49 (his name was coupled with that of Sherlock in Tom Brown's scurrilous satire of 1691 The Reason of the Late Convert's Taking the Oaths), and something of the pragmatism which led him in later years to submit his works to ministerial censorship55 and undertake to 'forbear Satire' on 'the present [i.e. de facto] Government'56 is apparent in his Georgics too, in its unillusioned habit of detecting constraint at the root of every form of cultural progress, and not merely in the constitutional innovations which had brought William to power in England in 1688. It is sometimes said that translating was a form of liberation for Dryden, that contact with pagan poets broadened his outlook on certain of the characteristic concerns of his original writing, permitting him to go beyond what was imaginable within the terms of the orthodoxies, in particular the religious orthodoxies, of his day. Paul Hammond has recently argued that in the Fables 'translation of Ovid and Lucretius allowed [Dryden] the freedom to ponder philosophical questions in a way which was not limited by the formulae of contemporary science and theology'.57 But in translating the Georgics Dryden was not so much freed as abandoned to an alternative imaginative world, one outside the consoling grasp of providence, a world in which the highest law is human passion brutishly imposed on nature, and called civilization. Unrestrained (or unprotected) by the injunctions to Christian patience, which in the works he wrote in his own voice after 1688 mostly moderate his temperamental inclinations to self-pity, Dryden indulged his affinity with the pessimistic aspects of Virgil's vision in the Georgics, concocting from them the nightmare of a civilization governed only by might. Legitimists claimed that nightmare had come true in Williamite England, but at times in Dryden's translation of the Georgics it sounds as though we have always been living it.
