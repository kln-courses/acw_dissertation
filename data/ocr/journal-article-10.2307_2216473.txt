<plain_text><page sequence="1">31 SARTRIAN EXISTENTIALISM The main theme of this article is to elucidate, and to present in some degree systematically, certain of the themes in that brand of existentialism which is associated chiefly with the name of J. P. Sartre. But I am not seeking to analyse his work alone: I use his name as representative of a whole movement of thought, partly philosophical and partly literary; and it is the whole movement with which I am concerned. It is for this reason that I do not give references in detail to Sartre or any of his fellow workers. I shall begin with a short description of the background common to exist- entialist theories; thereafter I shall proceed to expound the views of the Sartrian group and shall end with one or two general criticisms. I SOURCES OF EXISTENTIALISM 1. The Reply to Hegel-Subjectivity: The revolt against Hegelian 'objectiv- ity' provided the starting point for the 'father of existentialism ', S6ren Kierkegaard. It fulfilled the same function and quite independently more than half a century later for G. Marcel. Kierkegaard saw in Hegel, whether rightly or wrongly, the extreme example of the system-builder of abstract notions. His strong reaction against such system-builders was a reaction against those who would exhibit the ' drama ' of reality in terms of the abstract concepts of reason, and, in particular, against Hegel, who saw reality ultimately as the perfect self- expression of pure reason. In Kierkegaard's view, what is most real and important in and to the existing person escapes capture by such an 'objec- tive ' method. The unique real existing person eludes the dialectic of Hegel- ian idealism just as surely as it eludes the ' scientific method ' of positivism. We must divest ourselves of both rationalist and empiricist prejudices when we approach reality in order to find out what it really is. Marcel, working in a Red Cross bureau during the war of 1914-18, was brought, under the impact of other peoples' profound experiences, to turn from the idealism of his youth and its dialectics, which he now found abstract, to personal meditation on the significance of human life and of being. As for Kierkegaard, so for Marcel, neither the 'outsider's ' attitude of the scientific observer, nor the abstract objective attitude of the rationalist can take up and make intelligible those immediate experiences which form the very stuff of the concrete fullness of life. In an autobiographical essay Marcel talks of his insistent ' desire for the concrete ', and sums up his metaphysical pre-occupation as follows: 'My aim was to discover how a subject, in his actual capacity as a subject, is related to a reality which cannot in this context be regarded as objective, yet which is persistently required and recognized as real '.</page><page sequence="2">32 DOREEN M. TULLOCH This emphasis on 'subjectivity' and on the significance of the mode of being of a conscious self is the most fundamental and general characteristic, of all existentialist philosophy. It generates a number of favourite topics, which are shared by thinkers as far apart as Marcel and Sartre, Kierkegaard and Heidegger. It also influences their method of philosophising, where again there is agreement, in particular in their use of the medium of the novel, the drama, and the diary. We may note certain of these favourite topics before passing to the second source of the existentialist movement: (a) The subjectivity which is in question here has nothing in common with the self-complete intellectual cogito of Descartes. It is the subjectivity which is realised in lived experience, or in the actual concrete situation of an individual self. To reveal this subjectivity and to discover its meta- physical significance, therefore, the philosopher must make an effort to penetrate into life as it is lived or realised in the concrete. In such a context there can be no a priori separation of the purely intellectual element from the affective element in human activity. Thus one finds in all existentialist philosophers a considerable interest in the phenomena of love, hate, death and the fear of death, and indeed, in what may be termed the 'violent' affective experiences in human existence. (b) Existentialists are thus interested in what are characteristically human situations, and they may be said to take their point of departure from what is the human situation, i.e. the situation of being a self in the world. This leads to emphasising the significance of the fact that the self is an embodied self, and that it is as such that the self is in contact with the world in space and time. (c) Hence the importance given to the elucidation of the ultimate relation- ship which the self bears to the world. Here the most fundamental difference between theistic and atheistic existentialists may be said to take root. For the latter this relationship is such that no sort of transcendence is possible. The human being is necessarily and ultimately linked to the material uni- verse. For the theist the fundamental human situation reveals itself as open beyond the material universe. (d) If the world means, in the first place, all that is 'not-self', certain experiences reveal directly a peculiar character, namely, the experiences of other selves. All existentialists are agreed that the mode of relationship to other selves is not a mere instance of the relation to other things in the world, but that it reveals itself in immediate experience as possessing certain peculiar characteristics. There are important differences between the theists and the atheists as to what these characteristics are, but there is agreement on the importance of' the other '. This leads to a further formulation of the original human situation which may now be expressed as 'myself with others in the world '. It is this situation which all existentialists agree in taking as immediately given in experience. And it is this situation which they all seek to elucidate. 2. The Reply to Positivism-Phenomenology : Positivism is, on its epistemo-</page><page sequence="3">SARTRIAN EXISTENTIALISM 33 logical side, a type of empiricism. It claims that there is only one type of truth and intelligibility, namely, that which is found in objective, controllable, and universally verifiable experience. In the last resort, we may say, the presence of a conscious subject in the knowing situation may be ignored or left out of account when we ask, ' what is truth ' ?, or, ' what is intelligi- bility '? Idealism, on the other hand, holds that truth is grounded in the subject as knower. In the phenomenological method, popularised by E. Husserl, we find what is, in fact, an effort to transcend the empiricism-idealism dilemma in epistemology. Husserl's intention was to rethink philosophy in the hope of teaching absolute certainty. This hope, he believed, could only be realised by a radical method which swept away such intellectual constructions as empiricism and idealism, and which made a 'phenomenological reduction' by putting 'in brackets' everything that was not immediately given in experience. In particular, the existence of an external world had to be 'bracketed' because it did not fall within the phenomenological field. If we were to ask Husserl: 'What, then, is left ' ? he would answer, every- thing is left-consciousness with all its content; the world continues to appear to me as it appeared before . . . only I no longer make the act of existential belief which accompanies ordinary unreflective experience. In phenomenology the word 'phenomenon' has a far wider sense that it has in Kant, where its meaning is, in a way, pejorative, signifying what merely appears (implying that what appears is different from what is real in itself). Here, 'phenomenon ' means anything that in some way manifests itself to consciousness; all that is immediately present to consciousness as having a sense or significance for it. Hence the term stands for whatever is truly immediately given in the experience of a conscious subject. By his method Husserl claimed to lay bare the ultimate and intimate structure of the 'subject-object' relationship. What is of importance to note is that according to Husserl this method shows, (a) that consciousness is intentional, i.e. reference to an object is essential to its very nature; furthermore, just as consciousness is of an object, so, at this ultimate level, an object is for consciousness; and, (b) that conscious activity is not one pure undifferentiated activity receiving its specification from what is extran- eous to it, but that it, itself, as consciousness, manifests different specific structures. Perception, for example, differs from imagination, not by reason of the 'imaginary' nature of its object, nor by reason of the mental state of its subject, but intrinsically and by the very nature of the sort of conscious activity which it is. These points are worth noting for both are taken up by Sartre, and the influence of the second is clearly seen in the interesting work he has done on the psychology both of the emotions and of imagination. 'Existence' is, as we have noted, one of the things which Husserl put in brackets. The transition to existentialism is best summed-up by saying that it consists in the breaking down of the Husserlian brackets. The phenomenological method of describing what is immediately present to a</page><page sequence="4">34 DOREEN M. TULLOCH conscious subject is retained, but it is turned round to bear on existence. Thus the interest (which was, with Husserl, predominantly epistemological) is directed to the meaning and significance of existence. There follows a change of emphasis; metaphysical questions come to take the place of epistemological ones; the problem is no longer that of the ultimate ground of our certainty in knowledge, but rather, of the ultimate ground of our being or existence. From this shift of interest and from the 'philosophy of subjectivity', existentialism has been born. In what follows we shall attempt to understand certain of its manifesta- tions as these are found, mainly, in the work of the group in which Sartre is the central figure. II THE SARTRIAN DOCTRINE 1. The Meaning of Existence. To understand what 'existence' means for the existentialist we must go back to Husserl's phenomenological 'reduction' and in particular to his modification of the Cartesian Cogito. According to Husserl, the pure cogito of Descartes is an illusion, or at least a rationalistic construction: pure consciousness is never given-what is immediately given is always a con- sciousness of an object, and hence we have in phenomenology the leading theme of the intentionality of consciousness; i.e. the doctrine that it is of very essence of consciousness to refer beyond itself. Consciousness of its very nature is open (not closed as Cartesian rationalism would make it). If, now, with Heidegger we drop the phenomenological brackets and reframe our question in terms of existence instead of essence or nature, questioning ourselves as subjects on our being or existence as this is immediately revealed to us, we find that our existence as phenomenon-as immediately given to us in consciousness-is an existence which refers beyond itself-or which is only in the measure in which it goes outside itself. I become present to myself (my existence becomes a phenomenon) in the measure in which I go outside myself. Just as at the purely phenomenological (non-existence) level my consciousness realises itself, or becomes self-consciousness, only in the measure in which it goes outside itself and is conscious of an object, so too at the level of being I appear to myself, I am for myself (I exist) in the measure in which I am before the not-self (i.e. before things). Thus the peculiar mode of being which is proper to me as a subject (i.e. as a self-conscious being) is existence-to be as it were, outside myself- to refer beyond myself in order to be, or in the very realisation of my being. This explains the Sartrian phrase 'that the proper manner of being of man is, d'etre hors de soi pour etre soi-mnme ', and the characteristic theme of Sartre that consciousness as such is nothing. The mode of being of con- sciousness is to be what it is not-to come to be; the very mode of being of consciousness and thus of man, who is characterised by consciousness, whose realisation of himself is precisely the realisation of his self-consciousness, is an exigency-a nothingness which yet has-to-be. (Here we see Sartre's</page><page sequence="5">SARTRIAN EXISTENTIALISM 35 use of le neant; for Sartre le neant has, we might say, positive significance; it enters into the metaphysical constitution of man; his very nature is characterised by this tension of nothing and being, by this elan or striving out of nothing into being. 2. Essence and Existence. The term ' esistence ' has, for the Existentialists a technical meaning; it signifies the mode of being peculiar to man. In common usage in English we usually compare 'existing' to 'being' as a lesser value to a greater, e.g. we talk of a mode of life which is 'mere existence ', implying that this is ' just ticking over' as opposed to living ' to the full ', living the vegetative life as opposed to realising to the full the potentialities of human nature. In existentialist terminology, the usages are, as it were, reversed. 'To be' as opposed to 'to exist ' signifies mere ' thereness '-mere 'ticking over '. And going behind the terminology we can see the violent reversal of per- spective which this existential philosophy implies in our metaphysical conceptions. Sartre has himself described his position vis a vis traditional metaphysics as that of reversing the roles of existence and essence. This is not merely an attack on the rationalism which stops short at abstract essences. A philosophy of the concrete is common to such different schools as Thomism and Bergsonism, and may be said to be the inspiration of Husserl's phenom- enalism. Existentialism is much more extreme, and its attitude is best seen by elucidation of what, I would maintain, are the metaphysical assump- tions behind our usage of the terms 'merely existing' in opposition to ' realising the potentialities of human nature to the full'. (a) When we use these two phrases in oppositiof we do so within a frame of reference which may be summed up as follows: 'The sort of action or expression which a man can realise is determined by his nature, or, the way or mode of being of man is determined by his nature'. We recognise, too, that this 'nature' is very complex, more complex for example than an oyster's, whose mode of action or self-expression is limited to a very few definite actions. When we say of a man that he is merely existing, we are implying that he is not utilising to the full the possible ways of expression or action which are left open to him by his nature. On the other hand, when we say of a man that he is trying to do the 'humanly impossible ' we mean that he is seeking a mode of action or self-expression for which his nature is not adequate, or which his nature definitely precludes, e.g. trying to fly by waving his hands in imitation of the flight of a bird. (b) In looking at things in this way we do not imply that we can reach to an adequate and perfect knowledge of human nature (or of any other nature) which would enable us to say a priori just how a human being or any other being must express itself. Indeed we recognise that our knowledge of 'natures ' is gained piecemeal, a posteriori, and is indeed gathered from our knowledge of the actions of individual beings. Nor do we mean to say that a man's ' essence ' and his 'mode of being ' are two separate things out of which man is composed, or to attribute a temporal priority to man's essence.</page><page sequence="6">36 DOREEN M. TULLOCH All that we are trying to say is that man acts or expresses his existence within a frame of reference which is his nature or essence. We hold, further (and this brings in specifically Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysical con- ceptions) that this nature or essence is itself realised or developed through the actions which it itself makes possible; in other words, we recognise as a real aspect of being the state of potency; to take a banal example - at the moment, I am sitting in my room trying to write this paper; this is my state of actuality, the way I am existing and the way I am expressing my nature. But, I could be playing golf. I am in a state of potentiality vis a vis that mode of expressing myself and this ' state of potentiality ' does indicate something positive in me; it is not sheer 'absence '-it gives some positive information about me, namely that I have the power to express myself in this way. Now, it may be said that a person only knows that he can play golf, because he has played it, i.e. before he can be in this 'state of potentiality' he must have been in a corresponding 'state of actuality'. Consequently, in the last resort the potentiality of a being is determined by his acts or mode of expression, and not vice versa. To some extent this is true; for instance it is true that as a man's potentialities become actualised they also become as it were, more canalised and that what originally was possible to him is now in fact no longer possible, or becomes less and less possible, e.g. I do not think I could now start to play a violin. But, while this is true to some extent, it is not true in the very last resort; to hold that it is, is to commit oneself to the view that a man creates his nature by his acts. We recognise a wide measure of liberty or freedom in the actual mode in which a man expresses himself, but I would maintain that there is, as it were, a residue which is given to him or within which he works to realise himself. This residue is what we call his nature, bearing in mind what we have already said, namely that this nature is to a large extent potential; it is nevertheless real, and is in fact what at once restricts and, as it were, determines the way in which a being expresses its existence. (c) The implications of this view (and consequently of the opposite view of Sartre) are particularly striking in the sphere of Ethics, the science of right conduct in a man. If you subscribe to this theory of human nature, you recognise that in principle a science of ethics is possible or that it is possible to frame general principles of human conduct. (d) Another implication of this metaphysical view of the reality and signifi- cance of essences or natures vis a vis the acts or modes of expression of existent things or beings, is that the latter have a real foundation in the former and the knowledge of the latter does, albeit inadequately, lead to knowledge of the former; so far, therefore, as man is aware of the action and interaction of himself and what is not himself (let us call it the ' world '), he is aware, however inadequately, of beings with natures other than his own, and consequently with their own principle of intelligibility, which he may never be able to penetrate completely, but which serves as the term of his thought and the centre of orientation for his enquiry.</page><page sequence="7">SARTRIAN EXISTENTIALISM 37 We must insist that this is a metaphysical implication; i.e. it is an implication bearing on our attitude to the fundamental questions concerning the ultimate grounds of reality and our knowledge of reality. This does not carry with it any imposition of scientific method. In his scientific work, the scientist may be able to do without the conception of essence and exist- ence as we have been treating them, for as a scientist his concern is not to question the ultimate grounds of the reality of his objects, but to produce a satisfactory theory to account for their behaviour, assuming the existence of what may be called the material universe. But what we have been dealing with is one theory concerning the ultimate significance of this universe, and we have shown that this theory involves the view that at any rate the 'world' or natural universe is not made intelligible by the fact of man's knowing it, but rather that man realises his power to know by finding the intelligibility which is hidden in it. So far, then, its ultimate significance does not depend on man, nor consequently can man be the ultimate ground for its reality. If, then, these are four metaphysical assumptions implied in the tra- ditional distinction between 'merely existing' and 'realising our potential- ities to the full', what is the reversal of them made by Sartre ? We may describe Sartre's views briefly in the following terms: Man does make his nature by his actions; man does make his morality by his choice; and man does confer significance on 'the world' by the projects he imposes on it. We shall deal separately with the second and third of these reversals in the course of this article. The first is, in fact, the central theme which runs through all Sartre's work and its presence can be detected behind his every theme. It is important to realise how radical is the reversal expressed in the phrase 'man must create his own essence '. Sartre believes that man's nature is determined by his mode of being and not vice versa; and this in the very radical sense that it is of his very nature not to have a nature, but always to be projecting himself outside himself, always to be seeking to ' catch up with himself'. This is the significance of the phrase, ' etre hors de soi-meme pour etre soi-meme' from the point of view of the 'Existence- Essence' distinction. But to appreciate how radical is this reversal we must bear in mind that there is no possibility of a man at once remaining a man, and ' catching up with himself '. To realise the truth of this within this form of existentialism it is only necessary to refer back to what, according to Sartre, characterises man. It is subjectivity-the power of being self-conscious and existing for oneself. (Existence pour soi is the mode 6f existence of a being who is for himself as well as before objects; this mode of existence is given at the phenomenological level; it is really what is meant by subjectivity). Now such a mode of existence which is subjectivity, self-consciousness, pour soi, is, as we have been told, only possible in the measure in which a man is conscious of the not-self (the world of ' objects '). And this relationship to the not-self is existential, i.e. it characterises the very existence of a human being. To hope to ' catch up with oneself' is to hope for the impossible;</page><page sequence="8">38 DOREEN M. TULLOCH for it would mean remaining a man and yet destroying the relationship to the not-self which is a constituent in the very mode of existence which characterises man as subjectivity. From another point of view this hope might be said to be a move towards treating the self as an object; as some- thing to be grasped and held, whether materially or mentally, like the world of objects, and this clearly involves the destruction of the peculiar relation- ship of pour soi. 3. Meaning of ' Being '. If this is the mode of being peculiar to the self we may now ask what is the mode of being of the not-self, i.e. of the world which surrounds us. (This 'world' is, quite briefly, everything which is not self, i.e. everything whose relationship to the self is other than that of its relationship to itself, or everything which is 'objectivity' as opposed to 'subjectivity '). To this question Sartre makes the following double answer:- (a) The mode of being of the world (i.e. the not-self) is mere being. This can best be described as mere ' thereness ', or again as, 'the brute fact of being there'. (b) But the world which in itself merely is there can become an existent world so far as it comes to be for me, i.e. for a consciousness. So far as it serves as the object of my conscious activity it ceases to be mere 'brute thereness of being' and becomes a world of significance as embodying my plans and projects. (The reader will be reminded of Fichte's Nicht-Ich). For Sartre the meaning or significance of the world comes therefore from its relation of utility to the self, from its being the field in which a man expresses his subjectivity; it becomes the world of civilisation, of human inventions and organisations, of science and politics, of art and religion. Thus the world is in itself mere being,-it cannot be, as man is, for itself; it can only be in itself (' en soi '). But it can attain significance or meaning in so far as it is brought into relation with a self. This happens through the creative activity whereby a self imposes its projects on the world. The implications which follow from this view of Sartre's are :- (i) Unlike man, who does exist for himself and who may be said, in this sense, to have a meaning or purpose-who is characterised existentially by this effort to go beyond himself in order to be himself-the world in itself has no meaning or purpose or finality; it exists as sheer contingency; it is, in fact, fundamentally meaningless in itself. Its being is 'absurd'; it is, as Sartre says, 'de trop '. This is the status of 'thing-hood '. The status of ' object' already implies a self for whom things have acquired a meaning-whether as objects of science, art, or religion, etc. (ii) The double answer (in terms of 'being en soi ' and existing for a self) to the question of the mode of being of the world or not-self may suggest to us a type of idealism; and an idealism in which while 'things' do not obtain their reality from us, they do obtain their significance from us. We shall consider later the peculiar nature of this 'idealism ', which is, indeed so peculiar that perhaps no useful purpose would be realised in presenting Sartrian Existentialism with this label.</page><page sequence="9">SARTRIAN EXISTENTIALISM 39 (iii) The realisation of the brute facticity or contingency of the world, of its chaotic absurdity, provokes in man the sentiment of nausea (la nausee), or anguish (Angst) for Heidegger (as earlier for Kierkegaard). Heidegger has concerned himself greatly with this psychological state of the existential- ist; he regards this sentiment of anguish as the characteristic of the ' authen- tic person', i.e. the person who has accepted the fundamental absurdity of the world and is prepared at all times to live in the realization (a) that the ordered universe is not, as it were, the field in which he seeks to realise his aims and plans, but the very product of these aims and projects, and (b) that if he once relaxes this mode of ' ex-sistere ' which is peculiar to him as a self, not only does he disappear as a self, but the world of his projects also disappears into meaningless chaos. His activity as a self is not supported by a potentially co-operative and intelligible universe; the thought that it is rests on a rationalistic fallacy. Not many men are courageous enough to live 'authentically'. Most of us are 'inauthentic '. What does this mean ? It means that the majority of human beings are content to live at the level of their projects : to see in the world of' objects ' (itself the product of the activity of the self) the ultimately real world. Such men do not reach to the level of persons or selves but leave themselves at the impersonal level of 'one' (i.e. 'on' or ' Mann ') and consider themselves as objects among other objects in an 'ordered universe'. (These remind us of the fonctionnaires and of the functional mentality in which Marcel sees the fundamental 'sickness ' of modern society; man has ceased to be anything in and for himself, and has come to be, and to consider himself solely as, an element in an objective process, whether it be as fonctionnaires in the state machine, worker-unit in the factory, member of a political group, etc.). Such a false ' ontologising ' of the world of objects carries with it the objectification of ideas (the stuff of our projects) and their re-ification in idols, whether they be of religion (in a being who is at once fully en-soi and perfectly pour-soi; i.e. combines the character of complete subjectivity with that of complete fulness of being); or of humanitarianism with its objectification of human values; or of science (as the repository of universal and stable truths). For Sartre there is only one absolute-' I'absolu, c'est le contingent '. 4. Man's Ultimate Significance. In order to appreciate these consequences of the Existentialist thesis of the absurdity of being, with its attendant tragic interpretation of the fate of man, and the nihilistic strain of Sartre's work, we must return to man as subjectivity, and examine his ultimate position and significance within the totality. In order to do this, we will use another variation of the theme of Exist- ence; the theme of ' tre au monde'. To say that the correct mode of being of man is to exist, and to say that man is characterised as being to, or towards, the world is, for Sartre, to say the same thing. This enables us to specify in just what sense man can be said to be a creator or to create his essence. For this phrase taken in itself leaves open</page><page sequence="10">40 DOREEN M. TULLOCH the possibility of a transcendent mode of existence for man; that whatever may 'happen to ' a man from the ' outside ', so to speak, he remains essen- tially and in his innermost being 'master of his fate '. It may suggest, too, a type of idealism in which man because of a divine spark in him (or because of his ' share ' in an ' Impersonal Reason ') can with confidence and optimism go on to subject to his intellectual rule the chaos of impressions and events to which as a 'phenomenon' he submits. But we must understand clearly that, for existentialists like Sartre, there is no possibility of such a transcendent mode of being either for man or for any other being. For them being is mere facticity, and what is not being is 'nothing'. Consequently, the mode of being of man which is determined by the tension between these two-Ex-Sistere-introduces no new value of being; does not add to the possibilities of being. When we reflect on this we see that the absurdity of the world, of the 'en-soi ', turns back and envelops human existence itself, and this too becomes 'de trop ', without meaning or purpose in the last resort. For now we see that while man is characterised by plans and projects, i.e. by this mode of being which is to pro-ject oneself in the form of aims to realise, ideals to fulfil, the very existence of these projects or ideals depends upon their not being realised, depends, that is to say, on the persistence of the tension between nothing and being. The moment they are fulfilled and the man becomes thus identified with his project, or realises himself, he must either go beyond this to a further aim (if he would remain as a self) or slip back into the mode of merely being (' en-soi '), and cease to be subjectivity. We may put it this way: the ideals and projects share the mode of being of man, i.e. existence, and this involves a continual failure to realise them. Once realised they cease to be ideals. We can now understand the full force of the Angst or malaise with which the man of good faith or the authentic man must live his life. For looking beyond his present state he sees as the only possible realisation of himself, failure, and looking behind himself to the achievement of earlier ideals he sees merely the field of being-of what he was. Man is indeed ' de trop ',-an existential contradiction. If we ask in what sense it would be misleading to call these views ' ideal- ist ', the answer lies in their implication that in the very last resort no priority can be given to either consciousness (the self) or the world (the not-self). The original situation is a self open on to a world, and this not merely in the phenomenological sense that the ' object' is given along with the cogito (which leaves open the metaphysical question of the final grounding of either) but in the existentialist sense of the very existence of a ' pour-soi ' (self) being bound up with-we could almost say mixed with-the very existence, or being, of the not-self. In other words, the fundamental existen- tial situation is :-' Je-dans-le-monde '; human existence is, of its very being, existence-in-the-world. If we now recall that this 'world' is funda- mentally contingent we shall realise that to discover the world is to discover oneself, and that to find either is to find 'brute fact '; it is to find that for which no reason can be given. Hence to the searching personal question</page><page sequence="11">SARTRIAN EXISTENTIALISM 41 'What am I in the last resort ? ', the only answer I can give is-I am a being thrown into the world and when I discover myself I am already there in the world; I have neither chosen this nor wished to be. I too am ' de trop '. So far as I maintain my human mode of existence I am a being who stems from nothing and points towards nothing; so far as I am situated in the world I reside in sheer contingency. My tragedy is that I am a self, and as such I rise above my mere being (and thus above my historical sociological situation) but I rise above it toward nothing. For Heidegger, the realisation of this is most vividly presented in the sentiment of death. What is the significance of death to a person or self ? It is ultimately the definitive sign of the futility of man's power to transcend, in his plans, his situation and determination in time. Thus, the constant sentiment of impending death must accompany the authentic man, for he realises the sheer futility of that very mode of being which appears to lift him out of the temporal order. 5. Meaning of Choice. The mode of existence of a self is characterised by the act of choice. We are now in a position to appreciate the paradoxical nature of the creative function of man. Man, Sartre tells us, chooses his essence; he creates it by his act of choice. At the same time we have seen in the previous section the great insistence laid by existentialists on the situational aspect of human nature. Man's discovery of himself as a self is a discovery of himself as necessarily linked to the material universe, not in any abstract sense, but concretely in the 'here and now'. He finds himself as we have been told 'thrown into the world '. It is clear then that man does not choose to be; he does, however, according to Sartre, choose his essence. There is a sense in which common opinion would subscribe to the view that each man determines for himself (and to this extent is responsible for) what 'manner of man' he is, and does so by his choice of ideals, of ends and projects. But here again we must consider the radical thesis which is being professed by Sartre in these terms. Part of what Sartre is saying is that man confers meaning on his life and on his existence and being by the ideals he seeks, or, as we might say, by the causes he adopts : and that, while man is not free to choose or to reject his 'being in the world', he is free to choose his attitude towards the world, and this choice is effected in his choice of ideals and projects, in what he ' chooses to live for'. Further- more, such choosing can be done from a variety of motives; it can be done, as Sartre would say, in good faith, or in bad faith; or better still we may say that such choosing can be authentic or inauthentic. Perhaps the most blatant example of inauthentic choice is mere ' conformism ' under the pressure of external social sanctions. Heidegger's inauthentic man is the man of bad faith, the man who in his external actions subscribes to the mores of his society without even questioning the ultimate 'why' of such conformity. Indeed, such a man acts without really committing himself to his actions, without ever really engaging himself in the way of life he proposes to follow,</page><page sequence="12">42 DOREEN M. TULLOCH Personal freedom, responsibility, and inner sincerity-here we have, prima facie, the profession of certain elements which many thinkers would recognize as basic in any developed morality. Let us now, however, examine their real foundation and significance within the framework of existentialism. First of all, we must realise that the ideals which give a man his ' meaning ' when he chooses them have, according to Sartre, no objective value in- dependent of this man's choice of them. They become ideals or 'values' by his choice of them, just as the world comes to have meaning only in so far as the man embodies his projects in it. This enables us to make precise the sense in which the term 'choice' is being employed here. When we subscribe to the view that only free acts which express the choice of agents have moral value and thus belong to a moral order, we are not necessarily implying that the exercise of the liberty of choice is a sufficient cause and condition of the realisation of a moral value. Our view is consistent with the recognition that such a choice is founded on the appreciation of value. This indeed is what some people mean by 'Moral Freedom', viz.: the capacity to rise above the material 'conditioning' of our affective nature, and to appreciate or respond to value as value. However, it is clear that the thesis we are considering is not of this type. For whatever ultimate explanation be given of 'the phenomenon of value ' it remains true on the 'moral freedom' theory that value is not grounded in the act of choice of the individual as such. But Sartre's theory implies precisely this. Value is embodied in ideals and realised in projects, and ideals become ideals by being chosen, projects become projects likewise. Again we may draw attention to the extremely radical nature of this line of thought by pointing out that, according to it, in the last resort, no sense whatever can be given to the phrase 'reason for acting ', or, if we wish to be paradoxical, we may say that in the last resort, only bad reasons (corresponding to bad faith) can be given for any action. Recalling what we said earlier in this section about the inauthenticity expressed in mere conformism, and the possibility of choice from different motives, we may now complete this by pointing out that while subscribers to a type of' moral freedom ' theory may agree with the existentialist in rejecting as 'insincere ' the adhesion to a system of ideals for extraneous motives (self-indulgence, the good opinion of others, material gain, etc.) they do, nevertheless, recog- nise one motive as sincere and as providing a reason, namely, the pursuit of the ideal for its own sake, for the sake of the value it embodies. For the Existentialist, on the contrary, when we have eliminated all insincere motives we have eliminated all rational motives whatsoever; for the original choice no reason can be given: reasons start (and with them a system or code of values) only after the original fundamental choice or option. Here, on the secular plane, Sartre joins hands with Kierkegaard who interpreted the act of Faith, on which religion is founded, as the blind option or 'leap in the dark', in which all rationality is abandoned, and in which the individual soul in the deepest recesses of its being abandons itself in 'fear and trembling' and in bitter anguish to the Unknown Being,</page><page sequence="13">SARTRIAN EXISTENTIALISM 43 recognising in its act the irrationality of its action, and indeed committing itself to it for this very reason; this being the paradox on which all true religion is founded, according to Kierkegaard. If, then, for Sartre, there are no ideals which can be chosen for their own sake, there is ultimately only one thing which can be chosen for its own sake and that is the choosing itself. It is this which characterises the authentic man, the man of 'good faith': he is the man who chooses to act freely or chooses to realise his freedom of choice, instead of allowing himself to be 'solicited' by external motives which are made for him by the projects of others, whether by the religion of his people, the politics of his friends, or the social conventions of his milieu. If we ask again what reason a man can have for making this fundamental choice we can once again only say, paradoxically, no reason, save, indeed, irrationality itself; for we must remember that the realisation of this liberty of choice which characterises man goes hand in hand with the realisation of the absurdity of being and the fundamental futility of all ideals and projects : in choosing to act freely man is engaging himself to subscribe to the irrationality of all being, himself included. Finally, we may ask: Is it possible for man to make an alternative choice ? Is it not possible for him to withold his free consent, to refuse to engage himself in the world ? The answer to this is contained in the very existence of man and brings to a climax the tragedy of human existence as such. It is not possible for man at once to realise his humanity or to exercise his true mode of being, i.e. existence, and to withold himself from engage- ment in the world and consequently from submission to its absurdity. It is only if a man never ' realises himself', never reaches to the heights and to the depths of his personality that he can remain a 'spectator' of the world, content to see in the projects of others the field of his ultimate activity. If he once takes his being to himself, assuming responsibility for it, he must by this very act realise in himself at once his power of free choice and the necessity of his free engagement. For, at this ultimate point, to refuse, as it were, to be engaged in the world is itself to adopt a certain attitude towards the world, an attitude which will translate itself into actions and consequences in the world and this will be the adoption of a 'way of life '. There is no escape from the world and there is no escape from freedom. The tragedy of man is to be born free. Furthermore, just as there is no escape from freedom, so there is no escape from the responsibility it entails, and just as this freedom extends in its effects over all that man does and, indeed, is, so a man's responsibility is universal. Man' did not choose to be and yet by this mode of being, exist- ence, he is responsible for everything. Just as there is no objective norm through which his freedom as a moral agent may be said to be specified, so there are no rational bounds to what he is responsible for. By his original choice he sets in motion a whole course of events, and at this ultimate level, which for Sartre is the source of responsibility, no distinction can be made between what can be regarded as the reasonably predictable consequences</page><page sequence="14">44 DOREEN M. TULLOCH of an action and 'chance' results. Just as consciousness is of its very nature a projection into the not-self, so all actions, by their very nature, carry themselves over to the unknown and no barrier can be set. We are at once responsible for nothing (so far as we did not choose to be born), and responsible for everything, in that, being born, we are bound to engage ourselves, and in the last resort such an engagement is total. It is in the sentiment of this universal and inescapable responsibility that Sartre finds the root of the sense of malaise : this for Sartre is the sense of 'original sin'. 6. Other People. To experience that I am not the only person in the world is, for existential- ists, to experience a fact of singular significance. In it are involved two stages, each with its own attendant emotions. To be aware of another person is to be aware of another subject; that is to say, it is to be aware of another centre of reference to which 'things ' are referred, or 'drawn ', as beingfor that person. The awareness of another carries with it, consequently, the realisation of a world of reference, of projects and aims, other than my own, and this carries with it the attendant 'diminution' of my own world. What is meant by this is not simply that things are, as it were, taken out of my world, but that its whole value or meaning is shown up for what it is, the mere construction of my own subjectivity, and I now have the experience of finding all my 'objects' reduced to mere 'things', and then drawn into the orbit of another self, for whom they assume a different significance. I am, as it were, deprived of a ' world ' in order that there should be a ' world ' for someone else. And thus the presence of 'the other' comes to me as a threat to my freedom and a constant menace to my privileged status in being. The realisation of this engenders in me the emotions of aggression and fear. These are further intensified by the second stage in this experience when I realise that for another person I am no more than an object within his sphere of intention. I am thus reduced to the status of 'being in the world ', and then assumed into his world of projects and aims. The presence of 'the other' lays bare the absurdity and superfluity of my own being: it denudes me of all significance and reveals me to myself as a mere ' thing ', immersed in the universal absurdity of being. The existence of another thus deprives me of all the privileges which otherwise attach to this special mode of being, ' existence '. Alone in a world of things (of the ' en-soi ') my freedom would have been complete; with the presence of other selves it is constantly menaced. Alone in a world of things, the significance and meaning of the world would have been, once and for all, what I made it, and my power would have been universal. As it is, it is constantly slipping away so that neither do I possess myself as a 'pour-soi ', but become, in- stead, an 'object' for another, nor do I dominate the world of ' en-soi ', since it is constantly being pulled away from me into the orbit of another. There is thus at the basis of all specifically human relationships a radical contradiction which cannot be resolved.</page><page sequence="15">SARTRIAN EXISTENTIALISM 45 III SOME CRITICISMS 1. Sartre's ungrounded atheism. That the philosophy of J. P. Sartre is atheistic stems directly from his view of the fundamental absurdity of 'being-in-itself'. For to say that in the last resort no reason, no sort of explanation of any kind can be given for the existence of the universe is to deny that the universe owes its exist- ence to a supremely wise, powerful, and good Being. And while this may not be the whole of what theists subscribe to, their theory certainly does not contain less. Sartre has a more direct profession of atheism in his argument that the notion of 'God' is existentially impossible. For the theist holds that God is in the highest degree conscious of Himself and at the same time possesses his Being in perfect self-identity. Thus, in Sartre's terminology the notion of God combines the existentially incompatible characteristics of the perfect 'en-soi ' (complete self-possession) with the perfect 'pour-soi ' (self-consciousness). Since, for Sartre, being is divided up into that which is contained in its self, but which is not self-conscious, and that which is self-conscious but which does not possess itself in purity and detachment from the not-self, clearly there is no place for God in Sartre's philosophy of being. We seem justified in describing this position of Sartre's as dogmatic, and as in this sense ungrounded. It is in fact a position from which he starts rather than one which he establishes critically. The method which Sartre uses is phenomenological. As we noted, this method, as employed by Husserl, refrained from existential statements; its aim was to elucidate the structure of consciousness as that was revealed through immediate experience. This was the very purpose of the brackets, to impose a definite limitation on its findings; they were not to be inter- preted either existentially or onto!ogically; that is to say, they carried with them no assertion, either as to the existence of the phenomenological ' object' and 'subject' or as to their ultimate status in being (their onto- logical significance). We noted further that what Heidegger did was to banish the brackets, and to interpret the phenomenological field existentially; in particular, to interpret the immediate experience of a self-conscious subject as the manifestation of an existent being in the face of not-self. Now it seems that such a procedure is justified, but only if certain reserva- tions are kept in mind. It seems clear that all conscious experience involves the direct experience of the existence of the experimenter. I am directly aware of my own existence in all my conscious experience. Moreover, it also seems clear that any such experience of my own existence is bound up with the experience of something which is not myself. Consciousness, as we have said, is always consciousness of an object. However, we can now see the necessity of distinguishing between existential significance and ontological significance. For all that the above account permits us to say is that in the situation characterised as the ex-</page><page sequence="16">46 DOREEN M. TULLOCH perience of an object we can distinguish the existence of a self-conscious self and the presence before that self of something-an object-which is separate from the self in the act of experience. This we may call the exis- tential situation, and we may say it is characterised by the direct awareness of an existent self, over against a given not-self. Now what Sartre has done is to take this existential situation as ultimate, and in doing so he transforms it without further argument, into an assertion of ontological significance. By this we mean that Sartre takes the mode of appearance of the self to the self in experience and the mode of the appear- ance of the object in that same experience as the final mode of being (i.e. the ontological status) of the self and of the object respectively. This is what is meant when Sartre is said to equate phenomenology with philosophy. The dogmatism of this position can be shown in different ways. First, consider self-consciousness as it is made manifest in experience. Sartre here takes over the phenomenological analysis which reveals the intentional nature of this self-consciousness. Existentially interpreted, this gives as the mode of existence of a 'self' the reference beyond itself to what is not itself. But all that we are justified in saying is that in experience this is the way our existence is made manifest to us. We are surely not justified in concluding that this is our ultimate mode of being, and that therefore our ultimate status is that of a ' self' linked to an ' unintelligible ' world; or, to use the technical phraseology, of a 'nothing which strives towards being '. In the second place, even less are we justified in concluding that since 'self-consciousness ' is for us, in our existential situation, only realised when we look outwards to what is not ourself, therefore there can be no place in reality for a self-consciousness which is completely self-possessed. Con- sequently, there is no critical force to Sartre's denial of the possibility of the existence of a Divine Being who possesses Himself perfectly in the light of His own intelligence. It is only because of his original equation of the existential situation with the ontological ground that atheism follows for Sartre. Such an equation would only be justified if we knew ourselves to be the ultimate ground and source of all reality, i.e. if we knew ourselves to be the veritable creators of ourselves and of everything else. For in such a case reality in the last resort would simply be the appearance of ourselves to ourselves, and objects would simply be for us. Now, as we have already noted, Sartre does believe that man creates himself as a self-conscious being by his aims or projects. But the idealism which this points towards is vitiated by the equal recognition of the ultimacy of the not-self, the brute facticity of the ' world ', and this facticity reflects back on man himself, for when he discovers himself he is already 'there' in the world. Thus the original existential situation of man does not reveal him to himself as the ultimate creator in a sense which would justify equating man's existential situation with his ontological situation. Finally, if we now turn our attention to the 'world ', i.e. to all that whose mode of being is characterised as mere being, we can raise the same</page><page sequence="17">SARTRIAN EXISTENTIALISM 47 critical question. Sartre maintains that in the original existential situation this 'world' presents the character of sheer contingency; all we can say of it is that it is just there; we can give no meaning or significance at all. It is only so far as we, as self-conscious subjects, make it the field of our projects, that it takes on meaning. Consequently it has significance only in so far as it is 'for man '. Again we may with profit use the distinction between existential situation and ontological status. For, even if it were the case that the 'world', as present to man in his immediate experience, displayed the character of sheer contingency, man would not therefore be justified in concluding that that character was ultimate. All he would be justified in concluding would be that, since the world appears thus in the human existential situation, and since man cannot, as it were, 'escape' this situation, he cannot know whether in fact the world is, or is not, due to the action of God. Thus, at the most, Sartre's original starting point- the existential situation-ought to lead him to agnosticism. To go beyond this, as Sartre does, and claim not simply that man is unable to know whether God exists, but that God does not exist is to assume that man is the measure of truth. In the context we are considering, this amounts to the a priori assumption that phenomenology is identical with philosophy. 2. The Inadequacy of Phenomenology The problem of the relationship of phenomenology and philosophy is at the moment one of the main pre-occupations of those continental philosophers who are interested in Existentialism, and there is evidence in Heidegger's own more recent work of an effort to lay bare the elements involved in this question. Here we shall limit ourselves to what seem to be the preliminary requirements of any attempt to formulate an answer to this problem. The first point which we must emphasise is that, for there to be a problem at all, we must recognise the possibility of transcending man's 'historical point of view '. If man is inevitably and finally linked to his 'place in the world' then, of course, any effort at an over-all view of reality is denied him. In spite of his insistence on man's absolute freedom, this is, in fact, the fate to which Sartre condemns man. Man is, for Sartre, ' condemned to be free ', but the recognition of his freedom (which is for man one and the same with the recognition of himself as a conscious being) carries with it the recog- nition of the futility of his efforts to transcend the world, or to escape his status as a being 'thrown into the world'. Man seeks, says Sartre, to be a god, but the authentic man realises that such seeking is in vain. There is in the last resort no possibility of any transcendence whatsoever, and no possibility of a Transcendent Being. But it is clear that the impossibility of transcending the phenomeno- logical or existential level is not itself a phenomenological or existential datum. To assert the impossibility of transcendence is to make, not a phenomenological, but a philosophical, statement, which, made in this way is dogmatic. Moreover, it is a statement virtually destructive of existen- tialism itself, for a phenomenology carried out under the influence of such</page><page sequence="18">48 DOREEN M. TULLOCH an assumption will distort the field of immediate experience. The latter will be 'made to say' only what is consistent with the view that there is nothing 'behind ' or 'above ' it. And if this view be wrong (and phenom- enology cannot itself prove that it is right), then it is clear that such an approach will not ensure that correct description of the ' existential situation which it is the aim of existentialism to achieve. This is the criticism which directly or indirectly, has been made of Sartre by Gabriel Marcel, and by such sympathisers with the existentialist approach to philosophy as Rene le Senne, and Louis Lavelle. We may say that while Sartre describes certain human experiences with great imaginative brilliance, his descriptions are faithful only to certain aspects of human experience and not to human experience in its entirety, or in all its possibilities. Let us take, for example, Sartre's description of the experience of' being- in-itself'. It is in this experience that is generated the oppressive feeling of 'nausea' which, according to Sartre, is characteristic of what may be called the fundamental human attitude to which we attain once we have succeeded in divesting ourselves of the ' cover' which clothes all objects when they become integrated into our 'projects ', part of our ' civilisation ', or 'utensils' in our way of life. Now, the oppressive and nauseating nature of this experience arises from the fact that, according to Sartre, what is delivered in it is the presence of something which totally and completely escapes our intelligence, and, at the same time, imposes itself on us in its sheer unintelligibility. It is something against which we can do nothing, and which 'says nothing to us ', except that it is just there; and in its 'thereness' it cloys and pervades our self-consciousness so that we feel it all about us, invading our consciousness and defying our self-conscious efforts. To this, which is the status of' thinghood', Sartre gives the name 'being-in-itself', and it is what is revealed, and all that is revealed, when we succeed in reaching through to a vision of what something ' really is', as opposed to what it is ' for me ', as a person with plans and projects. It may be the case that at some time or other each one of us has had the strangely frightening experience of the ' obduracy ' and ' opacity' of objects, especially of inanimate objects, when we look at them apart from the cloak of their functional status. We sometimes say that an object ' seems to take on a life of its own'. What Sartre is asking us to do is to make this effort of removing the 'cloak' of functionality, and, according to him, such an effort will take us below all intelligibility into the sheerly irrational, the blind, opaque, and final 'given', which defies all reason and all effort of comprehension. Now, under certain circumataices, things may ' strike us' like this, or we may be filled with a fear of the blindness and ' irrationality ' of the world around us, and of our position in it. But, it is here that the importance of the use made of the ' abnormal ' elements in human experience comes in. We do not question that it may be of value to examine such cases; an adequate phenomenology of human experience cannot afford to overlook any material in its attempt to lay bare the nature and structure of experience in all its variety and complexity. Neverthiess, it would seem that the</page><page sequence="19">SARTRIAN EXISTENTIALISM 49 first requisite of a phenomenology undertaken seriously, that is to say, undertaken with philosophical intent, is to examine experiences which are seriously motivated, and by this we mean here experiences in which the consciousness of the subject is being ' energised ' by the effort to understand. It seems that the 'experience of being' as irrational, blind, 'de trop ', of which Sartre speaks, is an experience in which the cognitive elements have been entirely swamped by the affective elements. Starting off in a half- hearted effort to understand the ultimate meaning of being or reality, we may soon become discouraged at the difficulty of our task, and when this happens, it is quite possible that our cognitive driving force may give way to the affective elements in our nature so that we find ourselves taking a perverted satisfaction in what is, in fact, the failure of the force of our reason and not the total intransigence of its object, although we succeed in deceiving ourselves into believing that it is the latter. Sartre's pheno- menology of human experience might indeed be described as the pheno- menology of the person who is 'disillusioned and weary in spirit'. Now in the context of phenomenology this is open to grave objection, for two reasons. First of all, in its original inspiration, phenomenology was a method of transcending the subject-object opposition in the elucidation of the elements of immediate experience. We were asked to treat experience in its complex totality as a subject-experiencing-object. Consequently the 'subjective elements ', if we can call them that, are just as important and just as ' given ' as the objective elements, i.e. as the elements which we later called the 'not-self elements '. Thus we cannot, as it were, cut out the intentional element which comes from the subject and indeed characterises him as a subject in the experience under consideration. In the second place, phenomenology was to give us the structure and significance of original experience, or we may say, experience in all its purity. But the experience which Sartre offers us seems far removed from human experience in its originality or purity; it seems rather to be the product of a high degree of sophistication, and to be ' abnormal' in this sense. Sartre argues that the ' real ' before which man finds himself presents entirely negative character- istics vis a vis the subject awakened to self-consciousness; it is essentially the not-self, that which is opposed to self and opaque to consciousness. But this hardly seems phenomenologically correct. The not-self is perhaps strange, but with a strangeness which attracts, which does not offer itself as totally other but as somehow holding out the promise of familiarity. This seems to be the ' background ' from which our acts of knowing appear, and it is a background which is given in our existential situation. Whence this sense of familiarity, of what may be called 'community of being'? Phenomenology cannot answer; we must call upon a ' philosophy of being ' which will take its starting point here. To start as Sartre would have us do with the acts of knowing of a subject over and against a blind obdurate not-self is to refuse to answer this question; to refuse on phenomenological grounds is to deny that phenomenology raises the question, and to deny this, is to deny the 'signs' given to us in our original awareness of our</page><page sequence="20">50 DOREEN M. TULLOCH existential situation. In this original awareness we find as given the move- ment towards the not-self, both to welcome and possess it; we find the sense of wonder and the hint of familiarity. We do not fabricate these; we find them originally characterising our 'position' in being or reality, and it is only from them as given that what Sartre recognises as the phen- omena of a self-conscious subject develop. Our planning and organising, our projects of science, of civics, of social relationships, develop on a back- ground of deeper-if more hidden-communion which in a real sense is given to us, and which at the same time invites us to active participation, to acts of knowing and of loving. 3. The Inadequacy of Sartrian Ethics The account given above of Sartrian views on freedom, responsibility, and sincerity of motive, shows how widely they differ from the significance of these conceptions in a commonly accepted view of morality: we may ask whether these existentialist views provide an adequate basis for a moral system. The answer is not easy. Prima facie we seem to be presented with an extreme type of subjectivism, making impossible any sort of 'universal- ity' of moral behaviour at all. Since value only begins with the act of choice and since the latter is in the highest sense personal no one can in any way at all prescribe for another at the moral level : not merely can no one make another person moral (a view to which many would consent) but no one person can in any way provide an opening for the morality of another by pointing out a way of conduct. It would seem on this view that ultimately each person creates his own morality and his own moral order and there is no possibility at all of the erection of a standard or the discovery of a com- mon criterion. However, there are signs in the writings of the existentialists, in Sartre and in Simone de Beauvoir for instance, of an attempt to evade this appar- ently logical outcome of their views. For example, we must note that the use of such pejorative terms as 'inauthentic ' and 'bad faith' to describe the men who remain at the spectator level, or who are content to put forward 'bad reasons' for their choices. The implication of such a terminology seems to be that man has an obligation to raise himself to the existentialist level, i.e. to the level on which he realises his capacity of free choice. Now this capacity of free choice is given along with man; the appearance of man to himself is the very appearance of a being with the capacity of free choice. Implicit at any rate in the writings of these thinkers seems to be the acceptance of the capacity for free choice as a given value which men ought to promote, and it seems that it is on this ground that Sartre argues that Existentialism is a humanism, i.e. is a philosophy which upholds the value of the human person. And on this view it is reasonable to question whether any and every sort of project and ideal is compatible with the preservation and promotion of this capacity in the agent himself and in other persons. Again we may note the way in which Simone de Beauvoir characterises man, as a being who has not being, but who ' has to be' (qui a a etre), and this 'having to be ' is presented as an exigency, and this seems to suggest obligation.</page><page sequence="21">SARTRIAN EXISTENTIALISM 51 The central problem behind this 'morality' is the problem of suicide. Realising the absurdity of the world, of his being in it, and the futility of his ideals, why does a man choose to live ? (This problem is dealt with explicitly in Albert Camus' Le Mythe de Sisyphe). How are we to answer this at the existentialist level ? What would be the existentialist meaning of the act of suicide ? For Heidegger we can see that such an act would not be a human act, for it seems that the implication of his account of the authentic action is that such an action must be done within the sentiment of the insecurity of life and the fear of death. A deliberate act of suicide is one which is specifically to end this insecurity and at the fundamental level is incompatible with the fear of death in the existentialist sense. Now it may be said that this gives us not a moral condemnation of suicide, but an intellectual one. Nevertheless, it is not an intellectual answer in the sense of an answer in terms of abstract reasoning. For what it elucidates is the fact that the question of suicide-yes or no-is not, as it were, an abstract problem to be solved by a weighing up of pros and cons. Indeed we may go further and say that whether to commit or not to commit suicide is not a problem, because the alternatives cannot be treated as solutions. Suicide cannot be the ' solution ' of life, since it terminates it. We may put it thus : the very circumstances which raise the question of suicide at the authentic, existential level, namely the realisation of the absurdity of being, the futility of ideals, etc., reveal at the same time the fundamental irrelevance of suicide. We may say that the realisation of this is the complement to the realisation of the necessity of free engagement in the world-absolute liberty goes hand in hand with total engagement: this is the paradox of man and his tragedy. Man is doomed to live out his tragic existence and in this he must, according to Sartre, find his grandeur. In what sense this can be said to embody a moral judgment on the wrongness of suicide it is difficult to say. If the adoption of certain ideals or projects (for example a certain political creed) may be said to lead to situations in which the capacity of free choice is diminished, we may say that the destruction of all such projects and ideals and the complete abandonment of the human being to the status of mere being (which is the ultimate meaning of suicide, my body after death be- coming part of the material universe) is the final assault on that which characterises man and which underlies all possibility of value. We are thus brought back to the implicit recognition of the value of the possibility of free choice. The problem remains to decide whether existentialism, as here expounded, can ground this 'value' sufficiently. However, even if it were sufficiently grounded it remains'true that such a theory leads to extreme anthropomorphism, for we must remember that the 'human being' whom we recognise here as offering us our fundamental value is not a being with an intelligible nature sharing certain fundamental characteristics with others of the same nature, but a unique individual situated historically and necessarily linked to the material universe. We must remember, that is to say, that the possibility of free choice which we are called upon to respect is essentially embodied, incarnated and fundamentally contingent.</page><page sequence="22">52 DOREEN M. TULLOCH The 'moral attitude ' of existentialism seems then to be rather taken for granted than justified by argument. It may be noted, however, that such moral qualities or virtues as are praised, esteemed, or respected by Sartre and his followers are those which may be called the predominantly personal virtues, such as fidelity to one's ideal, sincerity of motive, willing- ness to assume complete responsibility for all the consequences of one's actions, and intellectual honesty. This is a noticeable reaction to that pre- occupation with social morality and social virtues which characterised post-Hegelian Idealism in Britain and indeed continues to colour the work of some contemporary moralists. It is, of course, also a reaction against the sociological school of Durkheim and his followers, and thereby exempli- fies in a particular sphere the continental reaction against the positivism of Comte.
